Gold climbed toward a one-month high
in London, extending a second consecutive weekly advance, on
speculation  Japan  will increase stimulus. Silver was set for the
longest rally in almost a year.  Bank of Japan (8301)  officials started a two-day policy meeting
today. The nation’s currency dropped to the lowest since June
2010 versus the dollar on speculation the BOJ, under pressure
from the government of new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will boost
stimulus to lift the economy out of recession. Gold remained
higher after  India  raised its import duty on bullion.  “The BOJ introducing fresh stimulus would be positive for
precious metals,” analysts at Mumbai, India-based AnandRathi
Commodities Ltd. said today in a report. “The economic calendar
from the U.S. is relatively light this week. Movement in bullion
may stay confined to a narrow band.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,689.30
an ounce by 5:07 p.m. in  London . Prices reached a four-week high
of $1,696.28 on Jan. 17 and gained 1.3 percent last week. Gold
for February delivery was little changed at $1,688.90 on the
Comex in  New York .  Bullion futures volume was 64 percent below the average for
the past 100 days at this time of day, according to data on
Bloomberg. Precious-metals trading will probably be subdued
today as U.S. financial markets are shut for a public holiday,
UBS AG wrote in a report. Gold at the afternoon “fixing,” used
by some mining companies to sell output, was little changed at
$1,687.50 in London compared with this morning’s figure.  India, 2011’s biggest gold buyer, raised  import duties  on
the metal and platinum to 6 percent immediately from 4 percent,
economic affairs secretary Arvind Mayaram said today in New
Dehli. Mayaram said gold demand will be moderate, while Angel
Commodities Broking Pvt. said consumption will probably fall in
two to three months.  Goldman Forecast  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects gold to climb toward
$1,825 over the next three months as U.S. lawmakers tackle the
debt ceiling amid slowing growth, while restating a forecast for
weaker prices in the second half as the world’s largest economy
rebounds, the bank’s analysts wrote in a Jan. 18 report.  Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the debt limit
79 times, including 49 times under Republican presidents,
according to the Treasury Department.  Silver for immediate delivery added 0.4 percent to $31.9813
an ounce, after reaching $32.1225 on Jan. 18, the highest since
Dec. 18. The metal is up for a sixth day, the longest rally
since January 2012. The  U.S. Mint  said last week that it sold
out of 2013 American Eagle silver coins and will resume sales on
or about the week of Jan. 28, when inventory is replenished.
Holdings in silver-backed exchange-traded products are at a
record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Palladium fell 0.6 percent to $717.50 an ounce, after
reaching a 16-month high of $732.50 on Jan. 18. Platinum was up
0.4 percent at $1,675.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
