OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , the biggest
gainer among New York-traded Russian stocks, will extend last
year’s 30 percent rally as it adopts international accounting
standards that will show the oil producer has about $30 billion
in cash, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG said.  American depositary receipts of  Russia ’s fourth-biggest oil
company rose to a 10-month high last week at $7.14 as oil capped
the longest run of weekly gains in 14 months. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of U.S.-listed stock climbed 2.8 percent
to 103.11, the highest since September, as  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  and
 VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  surged more than 12 percent. Futures on the RTS
Index lost 0.2 percent to 160,180 on Jan. 18.  Surgut will prove it had the most cash in a decade at the
end of 2012 as it’s scheduled to report earnings in April under
international accounting standards for the first time since
2001, Michele della Vigna and Peter Hackworth, analysts at
Goldman in  London , wrote in an e-mailed report on Jan. 17.
Investors would expect the company to use the money for dividend
payments and new exploration projects, UBS said.  “The company will probably show more than $30 billion in
cash under international accounting standards and that is going
to be a catalyst for further price increases,” Constantine Cherepanov, an analyst at UBS in Moscow who has a buy rating on
the stock, said by phone from Moscow on Jan. 18. “The money
pile protects the stock from any meaningful decline.”  Russian Standards  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, increased 0.9 percent to $30.38 on
Jan. 18, capping a 2.1 percent weekly gain. The RTS Volatility
Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock futures ,
declined 6.1 percent to 20.20.  Surgut probably had $32.2 billion in cash by end-2012,
Goldman said, reiterating its buy rating and adding the stock to
the central and eastern  Europe , Middle East and Africa focus
list. The company’s  market value  was 1.03 trillion rubles, or
$33.9 billion, as of Jan. 18, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia’s three biggest oil producers -- OAO Rosneft,  OAO
Lukoil (LUKOY)  and TNK-BP -- currently report to U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles, or GAAP, and have either already shifted
to IFRS or pledged to do so. Surgut isn’t required to give
details on its cash holdings and treasury shares under Russian
accounting standards.  “There are funds that are not allowed to buy shares of
companies that don’t report in IFRS,” Cherepanov said. “If
that obstacle is removed, demand for Surgutneftegas’s shares
would rise immediately.”  Shpilman Field  The ADRs rose 0.8 percent on Jan. 18 in  New York  for a 6.6
percent weekly advance. One ADR is equal to 10 Moscow-listed
preferred shares. The  stock  climbed 2 percent to 21.63 rubles,
or 71.5 U.S. cents, on Jan. 18 in Moscow, the highest level
since Sept. 10.  Surgut increased crude oil  output  by 1 percent to 61.4
million tons in 2012 from 2011, the company said in a Jan. 15
statement on its website. Gas production was at 12.2 billion
cubic meters in 2012, according to the statement.  The company will probably keep production near the current
levels in 2013 through 2015 before increasing output as soon as
in 2016 after winning rights to the Shpilman field in December,
Goldman Sachs’s analysts said in the report.  The oil producer won rights for the Siberian field by
offering to pay almost four times more than the asking price,
outbidding  OAO Rosneft (ROSN)  and OAO Gazprom Neft, Russian subsoil
agency Rosnedra said in a Dec. 18 statement.  “Favorite Vehicle”  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY)  rose 2.4 percent to $13.77 in New York on Jan.
18 to the highest since March. In Moscow, the stock  gained  2.2
percent to 103.4 rubles, or $3.42, the highest level since July
15, 2011. Trading volume was at 1.5 times the average for the
past three months. Each ADR represents four common shares.  Sberbank rallied after JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s analysts led
by Alex Kantarovich in Moscow said in a Jan. 18 report that the
stock has the potential to gain 37 percent in 2013, calling it
JPMorgan’s “favorite vehicle” for Russian exposure.  ADRs of VimpelCom posted a weekly gain of 12 percent, the
biggest since the five days to Aug. 17. They were unchanged at
$11.9 on Jan. 18.  CTC Media rose 2.5 percent to $9.28 on Jan. 18, the highest
level since Oct. 22, and advanced 14 percent for the week, its
biggest gain since August.  Crude oil for February delivery added 0.1 percent to $95.56
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on Jan. 18, the
highest settlement since Sept. 17. Brent oil for February
settlement increased 0.7 percent to $111.89 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, while  Urals crude ,
Russia’s chief export blend, added 0.7 percent to $110.89.  The ruble fell 0.3 percent to 30.27 on Jan. 18. Ruble
futures showed the currency little changed at 30.539 per dollar.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
gained 1.2 percent to HK$5.01 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:45
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed.  -- Editors: Marie-France Han, Tal Barak Harif  To contact the reporter on this story:
