Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. (933) ,
 Singapore ’s third-largest supplier of marine fuel, said it has a
“healthy” amount of cash available, and operations haven’t
been affected by a breach of its loan agreement.  The company is applying for waivers with its banks to
prevent possible default on loans, Ella Mak, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman, said by telephone today.  Brightoil has breached the interest-coverage ratio covenant
on at least one loan relating to vessel financing, the company
said in a statement on Jan. 16. It also expects to have a
“material loss” in the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with
a  profit  in the same period a year earlier, because of depressed
market conditions in the shipping industry and falling margins
for marine oil, known as bunker, according to the statement.  Brightoil was the third-largest bunker supplier last year
in Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering port,  according  to
the city state’s Maritime and  Port Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
