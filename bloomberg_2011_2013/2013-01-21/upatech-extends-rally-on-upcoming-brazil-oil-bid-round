Lupatech SA (LUPA3) , a Brazilian oil-
services provider, extended a rally today as investors bet it
will win new business from companies buying exploration licenses
in a bidding round in May.  Lupatech, based in Caxias do Sul, jumped 14 percent to 2.50
reais at 12:29 p.m. in  Sao Paulo , extending gains this year to
51 percent. The stock soared 24 percent on Jan. 18 after
announcing that Thiago Piovesan took over as Chief Financial
Officer.  “With the new bid round the outlook is positive,” Bruno
Piagentini Caloni, an analyst at brokerage Coinvalores, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “The market is viewing the management
changes well.”  Last year Lupatech acquired San Antonio Brasil to expand
into the onshore drilling and services market. The company also
sells equipment and services for offshore production facilities.
Brazil plans to sell 172 exploration blocks on land and off the
country’s northeastern coast in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
