VTB Bank OJSC (VTBR) , Russia’s second-
biggest lender, is said to be seeking a three-year $1.5 billion
loan with similar terms obtained by larger rival OAO Sberbank
last year.  The company is offering to pay a margin of 150 basis points
more than the  London  interbank offered rate for the loan,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal, who
asked not to be identified because the terms are private. The
so-called all-in margin, in which banks’ fees are included, is
190 basis points more than Libor, the people said.  Barclays Plc is helping Moscow-based VTB market the deal to
other lenders, and it’s expected to sign in the next three
weeks, the people said.  Barclays also coordinated a loan with the same size,
maturity and pricing for Sberbank in October, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Russia ’s state-run development bank
Vnesheconombank got lower pricing in November, successfully
raising an $800 million loan with an all-in margin of 185 basis
points, the data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A Moscow-based spokeswoman for VTB declined to comment,
asking not to be named citing company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
