     Jan. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Deutsche Boerse AG, the German
exchange blocked from buying  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  last year, said it's
not worried by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) ’s agreement to
acquire the operator of the New York Stock Exchange.  “It hasn’t caused us any sleepless nights,”  Reto Francioni , chief executive officer of Deutsche Boerse, said in
an e-mailed version of a speech he’ll make at the company’s
annual New Year reception in Eschborn, Germany, this evening.
“We anticipated a step such as the ICE -- it could have been
another non-European stock exchange organization -- and prepared
ourselves for it very early on.”  ICE, the 12-year-old energy and commodity futures bourse,
agreed on Dec. 21 to acquire NYSE Euronext for cash and stock
worth $8.2 billion. European Union regulators blocked Deutsche
Boerse’s purchase of NYSE last year, citing concern over
competition in derivatives and clearing and rejecting arguments
the combined exchange would be a regional champion.  “Through that merger,  Europe  would have been able to
increase its influence significantly on a positive and socially
responsible design for world markets,” Francioni said. “I
think that Europe wasted an essential opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
