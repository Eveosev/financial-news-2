HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s largest
bank, hired Ruth Horgan as global head of regulatory compliance
after David Bagley quit in July over the lender’s failure to
guard against money laundering.  Horgan joins from accounting firm KPMG LLP, where she had
been a partner since 1999 and had worked on the team auditing
HSBC until March 2010, the London-based bank said today in a
statement.  Horgan has “deep knowledge of the industry with almost 25
years of experience in the financial sector specializing in
retail, corporate and investment banking,” HSBC said in the
statement.  Bagley in July told a Senate hearing he would step down as
head of group compliance amid claims the bank gave terrorists,
drug cartels and criminals access to the U.S. financial system
by failing to guard against  money laundering . The bank last
month agreed to pay $1.9 billion to close a global money-
laundering probe by the  U.S. Department of Justice  and banking
regulators in the U.S. and U.K.  Bagley was among HSBC executives who testified before the
Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations after the
panel released a 335-page report describing a decade of
compliance failures by the bank. A day before the settlement,
HSBC appointed Robert Werner, previously head of the U.S.
Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, as head of group financial
crime compliance and group money laundering reporting officer.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
