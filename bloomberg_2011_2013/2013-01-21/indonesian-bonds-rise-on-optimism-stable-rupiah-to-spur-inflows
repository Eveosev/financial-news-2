Indonesia ’s government bonds rose,
pushing the benchmark 10-year yield to the lowest in a week, on
optimism a more stable rupiah will spur capital inflows.  The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, held at
6.75 percent for the seventh day today. The currency’s spot rate
advanced 0.1 percent to 9,625 per dollar, prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The central bank has and will
introduce policies to boost the exchange rate to 9,400 to 9,600,
Investor Daily Indonesia reported today, citing Governor  Darmin Nasution .  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.25 percent as of
3:36 p.m. in Jakarta, the lowest since Jan. 11, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association. Indonesia’s 10-
year yield compares with 4.54 percent for similiar-maturity
Philippine notes and 3.68 percent for  Thailand ’s securities.  “The yields still have room to decline further,” said
Billie Fuliangsahar, the head of treasury at PT Rabobank
International Indonesia in Jakarta. “The rupiah has been quite
stable, allowing for better confidence, and local yields remain
attractive compared to other nations.”  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards
strengthened 0.2 percent to 9,823 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s 2 percent weaker than the spot rate. A
daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was set at
9,823 today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  To contact the reporter on this story:
