Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  may extend a
rally that has lifted China’s biggest Internet stock more than 8
percent this year after the shares broke above moving averages
and a measure of trading momentum surged, according to AMTD
Financial Planning Ltd.  Tencent has traded above its 50-day moving average since
Jan. 16. The last time the shares broke above the average on
July 3 it heralded a 20 percent gain through Nov. 2. The stock
is also trading above its 100- and 200-day moving averages, with
its nine-day relative strength index, a measure of trading
momentum, climbing to 80.2 on Jan. 18 from 53.99 at the start of
the week. Tencent gained 1.1 percent to HK$270.40 on Jan. 18.  “The share price broke above all the major moving
averages, maybe there’s some breakthrough,” said  Kenny Tang ,
Hong Kong-based general manager of AMTD. The rising relative
strength index “indicates momentum has been improving in the
share price. It should test HK$280 in the short-term.”  Tencent also broke above its  Ichimoku cloud  on Jan. 16,
another bullish signal used by some technical analysts. The last
time the stock broke above the cloud -- a pattern formed from
midpoints between historical highs and lows -- was on Aug. 15,
after which it jumped 21 percent in the next 11 weeks.  Technical analysts study charts of trading patterns and
prices to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
