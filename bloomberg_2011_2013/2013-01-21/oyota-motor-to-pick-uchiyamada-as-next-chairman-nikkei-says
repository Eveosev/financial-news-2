Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  will probably
pick Takeshi Uchiyamada, who led the development of the Prius
hybrid car in 1990s, to replace Fujio Cho as the company’s next
chairman, Nikkei reported today, without citing anyone.  Cho, 75, will become a senior adviser, though a final
decision will be made at a board meeting in June, Nikkei said.
Uchiyamada, currently vice chairman at Toyota, may also become
vice chairman of the Keidanren,  Japan ’s largest business
lobbying group, Nikkei said.  While President Akio Toyoda, grandson of the founder, is in
charge of day-to-day operations at Asia’s largest carmaker, a
change in chairmanship would be Toyota’s first since Cho took on
the role in 2006. A new chairman would face the challenge of
helping Toyoda revive the Japanese automaker’s leadership in the
global  auto industry  in the face of mounting competition from
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)   Naoto Fuse, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Toyota, said the
company isn’t the source of the information in the Nikkei report
and declined to comment further.  Uchiyamada, 66, led Toyota’s development of the Prius --
the world’s best-selling gasoline-electric car -- before he was
promoted to vice president in 2005. He became vice chairman of
Toyota’s board in June 2012. Uchiyamada graduated from Nagoya
University in 1969 with a degree in applied physics and joined
Toyota the same year, according to the company’s website.  Cho was president of Toyota from 1996 to 2005 before
becoming chairman in 2006.  Separately, Nikkei reported Masanori Mitsui and Yasuhiko Ichihashi will become the presidents of Toyota subsidiaries
 Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262)  and  Hino Motors Ltd. (7205) , respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
