China ’s imports of crude from Iran
rebounded to the highest level in six months in December after
the U.S. renewed an exemption from penalties on banks that
process payments for the Persian Gulf nation’s oil.  China, the world’s second-biggest crude consumer, bought
2.52 million metric tons of oil from Iran last month, according
to figures from the General Administration of Customs today.
That’s up 43 percent from November, when purchases slipped 9.3
percent. Shipments averaged 596,000 barrels a day, the most
since June, and advanced 3.6 percent from December 2011, the
data showed.  The U.S. State Department on Dec. 7 extended exemptions for
180 days for China and eight other countries from measures
related to sanctions against  Iran , saying they had “continued
to significantly reduce” their purchases of the Middle East
nation’s oil. China’s total crude imports last year from the
Islamic republic, its third-biggest supplier, slid 21 percent to
22 million tons, the customs data showed.  “The annual decrease in imports was within expectations
and safely in the range of 20 percent to 30 percent in crude
cuts required by the U.S.,” Li Li, an oil analyst with
Shanghai-based commodity researcher C1 Energy, said by phone.
“China will continue to import limited crude from Iran just to
get around the U.S. as a political compromise.”  China’s monthly purchases from Iran may be 1.7 million tons
to 2 million tons in the first half of this year, similar to the
average for 2012, Li said. The U.S. and the European Union are
pressuring Iran to curtail its nuclear program, which they say
is aimed at developing an atomic weapon.  Saudi Arabia continued to rank as China’s largest crude
supplier last year, providing 53.9 million tons, up 7.3 percent
from 2011, the customs report showed. The Middle East nation
accounted for 19.9 percent of China’s imports, compared with
19.8 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
