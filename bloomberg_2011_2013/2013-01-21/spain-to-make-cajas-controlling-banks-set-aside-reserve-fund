Savings bank foundations that
control Spanish lenders will have to set aside a reserve fund to
cover future capital needs.  Foundations that own more than 50 percent of the shares of
a bank must also present a financial plan that spells out how it
diversifies investments and manages risks, according to a  draft
law  published today by the  Economy Ministry .  Spain is responding to pressure to tighten oversight of
lenders linked to former savings banks after weak risk controls
at the so-called cajas led the country to seek a banking bailout
last year. The  Bankia (BKIA)  group, formed from the merger of seven
savings banks led by Caja Madrid, said in November it was set to
post a 19 billion-euro ($25.3 billion) loss this year as it
absorbs costs for cleaning up its soured real estate.  The memorandum of understanding for Spain’s banking bailout
published last July committed the government to strengthen the
oversight of cajas and make them reduce their stakes in lenders
below levels of control. The government’s draft law allows cajas
to retain control of banks while strengthening controls of
governance and risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
