Indian (SENSEX)  stocks rose from a two-year
high after  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the country’s largest
company by value, reported profit that exceeded estimates.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index increased 0.3 percent to
20,101.82 at the close, with volumes exceeding the 30-day
average by 16 percent. Reliance, owner of the world’s largest
refining complex, climbed to more than a 19-month high after
third-quarter  net income  rose the most in two years.  Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the biggest power-equipment producer,
rallied the most in a month.  The Sensex surpassed 20,000 last week for the first time in
two years, as the government allowed refiners to increase diesel
prices to cut the nation’s budget deficit. The decision is the
latest in a series of measures announced since September by the
government to boost economic growth. The gauge may climb to
22,500 this year if policy measures are sustained, Deutsche Bank
AG wrote in a Jan. 15 report.  “The market is betting on two things: the reforms coming
through will feed into the economy later this year, and if you
have rate cuts then that will help the economy turnaround,”
Jyotivardhan Jaipuria, head of India research at Bank of America
Corp., said in an interview to Bloomberg TV India today.  Reliance, controlled by billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , posted a
24 percent increase in December-quarter profit after trading
ended on Jan. 18. Net income increased 24 percent to 55 billion
rupees, surpassing the 50.1 billion rupee median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. The stock advanced 2.2 percent to 919.95
rupees, the highest close since June 13, 2011.  Earnings Cycle  Only one out of 10 Sensex companies that have reported
December-quarter earnings has trailed forecasts. That compares
with 40 percent of index firms in the three months ended Sept.
30, the same as for the three months ended June, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the largest mortgage
lender, today said profit increased 16 percent to 11.4 billion
rupees, matching analysts estimates. The stock fell 1.2 percent
to 812.5 rupees.  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , the largest power producer, said
profit rose 22 percent to 26 billion rupees, beating estimates.
The shares fell 1.8 percent to 161.6 rupees, after jumping 7.7
percent last week.  “Earnings have been downgraded massively for the last two
years and we are now probably somewhere close to the end of the
downgrade cycle,” Jaipuria said. “If things start changing in
terms of interest-rate cuts and reforms, the market is willing
to ignore the short-term macro news.”  Eleven of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey predict
the repurchase rate will be cut by 25 basis points at a Jan. 29
review, while two forecast a 50 basis point reduction. The rate
was last pared by half a percentage point in April. The
wholesale-price  index  rose 7.18 percent in December from a year
earlier, the least since 2009, government data showed last week.  Fund Flows  Bharat Heavy jumped 2.5 percent to 232.05 rupees.  Maruti
Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, added 1.8 percent to
1,574.6 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, increased 2 percent to 1,567.35 rupees.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s measures to revive growth
helped attract $24.5 billion of foreign inflows into India’s
stocks last year, the highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, excluding  China . Foreigners have bought a net $2.5
billion of shares this year, 82 percent more than at the same
time in 2012, data from the regulator show.  “Global easy money is heading toward equities and India
remains a preferred market for flows,” said Jaipuria. “Foreign
investor sentiment toward India remains strong.”  The S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange of
India added 0.3 percent to 6,082.30. The India VIX index, which
gauges the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, lost
1.7 percent to 13.66. The BSE Mid-Cap Index fell 0.1 percent.  The Sensex has gained 3.5 percent this year and  trades  at
16 times estimated earnings, the highest since February. The
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index is valued at 11 times, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
