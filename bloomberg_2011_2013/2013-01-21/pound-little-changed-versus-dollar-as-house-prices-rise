U.K. government bonds fell, with
two-year yields rising the most in two weeks, as an industry
report showing British  house prices  increased in January reduced
demand for safer assets.  Ten-year bond yields climbed toward the highest level in a
week before the Debt Management Office auctions 1.75 billion
pounds ($2.77 billion) of the securities tomorrow. Gilts also
dropped as European  stocks  gained, boosting the appeal of
higher-yielding assets. The pound fell for a seventh day versus
the dollar before the Bank of England releases the minutes of
its January meeting this week and the government reports
economic growth for the fourth quarter.  “The overall outlook in the U.K. is for rather more
inflation than in many other countries,” said  Marc Ostwald , a
rates strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “Gilt
supply tomorrow shouldn’t prove too much of a problem. The
market is extraordinarily thin today and overall I think people
will want to keep their powder dry for the data and events we
have in the U.K. this week.”  The two-year gilt yield climbed four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 0.42 percent at 4:02 p.m. London time, the
most since Jan. 3. The 5 percent bond maturing in September 2014
fell 0.075, or 75 pence per 1,000-pound face amount, to 107.40.  The benchmark  10-year yield  increased five basis points to
2.06 percent after advancing to 2.07 percent on Jan. 18, the
highest level since Jan. 11.  Home Prices  Rightmove Plc said British home prices nationally rose 0.2
percent this month after dropping 3.3 percent in December.
Asking prices in  London  jumped 9.7 percent from a year earlier,
the biggest annual increase since February 2010.  The  difference in yield  between 10-year gilts and index-
linked securities, a measure of inflation known as the break-
even rate, widened as much as two basis points to 3.06 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of regional shares rose 0.2
percent and the FTSE 100 Index gained 0.4 percent.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.4 percent this month
through Jan. 18, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds dropped 1.1 percent and Treasuries fell 0.3 percent.  The pound weakened 0.2 percent to $1.5839 after dropping to
$1.5832, the lowest since Nov. 15. The seven-day losing streak
is the longest since November 2010. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to
84.06 pence per euro after depreciating to 84.09 pence, the
weakest since March 13.  Moving Average  The pound’s close below its 200-day moving average last
week “suggests there is further downside,” said Melinda Burgess, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in
London. Sterling last closed beneath the average on Nov. 14,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  RBS forecasts the currency will decline to $1.5630 by the
end of March and $1.5260 by year-end, Burgess said.  The  Bank of England  will release the minutes of its January
meeting on Jan. 23. U.K. gross domestic product dropped 0.1
percent from the third quarter, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists before the  Office for National Statistics 
issues the data on Jan. 25.  The pound weakened 2.3 percent this year, the second-worst
performance after the yen, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes which track 10 developed-market currencies. The
euro gained 1.6 percent and the dollar rose 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
