Japan ’s copper wire and cable
shipments fell 1.2 percent in December from a year earlier,
dropping for the third time in four months as demand from the
auto, electric-machinery and export industries slowed.  Shipments totaled 58,000 metric tons last month, compared
with 58,711 tons a year earlier, the  Japanese Electric Wire &
Cable Makers’ Association  said today in an e-mailed statement.
They totaled 62,174 tons in November, up 2.9 percent from a year
earlier.  “Shipments remained subdued last month because of a
slowdown in the economy” said Keiichi Ohki, an official at the
association’s research department. “We may see a recovery in
coming months with the government’s stimulus package and a pick-
up in demand for rebuilding.”  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this month unveiled a
10.3 trillion yen ($115 billion) stimulus package that Nomura
Securities Co. forecasts will help deliver real annualized
growth of 3.5 percent in the April-June quarter. Prospects for
exporters may improve this year as the yen has fallen about 10
percent against the dollar since mid-November.  Japan posted a larger-than-expected current account deficit
in November as exports fell. The  shortfall  in the widest measure
of the nation’s trade was 222.4 billion yen, the Ministry of
Finance said on Jan. 11. The median estimate of 19 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was for a 17.1 billion yen deficit.  Japan’s GDP shrank at an annualized 3.5 percent pace in the
third quarter after contracting in the three months through
June, meeting the textbook definition of a recession. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is for a 0.6
percent contraction in the three months through December 2012,
with growth in the three months to March seen at 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
