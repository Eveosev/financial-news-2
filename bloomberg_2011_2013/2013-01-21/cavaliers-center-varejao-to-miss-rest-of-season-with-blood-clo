Cleveland Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao will miss the rest of the National Basketball
Association season because of a blood clot in his right lung.  Varejao, 30, who averaged 14.1 points and 14.4 rebounds
through 25 games, was admitted to the  Cleveland Clinic  last week
and prescribed blood thinners. The team said he is expected to
make a full recovery.  “We’re disappointed for Anderson and his family,”
Cavaliers General Manager Chris Grant said in a statement on the
team’s  website  yesterday. “We know how much he wants to be on
the court helping his teammates.”  A native of  Brazil , the 6-foot-11, 260-pound center was
selected by the  Orlando Magic  in the second round of the 2004
NBA draft. He was acquired by the Cavs along with Drew Gooden
and Steven Hunter from Orlando in a trade that year for Tony Battie and two second-round picks.  Varejao  has averaged 7.7 points, 7.6 rebounds and 0.7
blocks through his nine-year career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
