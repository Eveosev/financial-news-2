Yale University’s acceptance rate
will drop below last year’s 7.1 percent as undergraduate
applications rose to a record.  The number of applications rose 2.8 percent to 29,790 from
the previous year, Jeffrey Brenzel, dean of undergraduate
admissions, said in an e-mail. About 2,000 will win a seat to
start the 2013-14 school year in New Haven, Connecticut.  This year, Yale allowed students to request that their
materials be shared with Yale-NUS College, the new liberal arts
college in Singapore that the university is jointly founding
with the National University of Singapore. The two schools
operate independent admissions processes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
