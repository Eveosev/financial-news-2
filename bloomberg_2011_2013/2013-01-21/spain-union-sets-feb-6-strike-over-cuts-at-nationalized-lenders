The Spanish banking union called for
a Feb. 6 general strike over planned job cuts at nationalized
lenders  Bankia SA (BKIA) , NCG Banco SA and  Banco de Valencia SA. (BVA)   The strike will be preceded by demonstrations and partial
strikes on Jan. 23 and Jan. 30, COMFIA-CCOO, which represents
about 73,300 banking employees at the Comisiones Obreras union,
said today at a news conference in Madrid.  Bankia, the largest Spanish bank due to receive a European
bailout, and NCG plan to reduce balance sheets by more than 60
percent by 2017 from 2010 levels. Valencia, Spain-based Bankia
said on Nov. 28 it would cut about 6,000 jobs, or more than a
quarter of its workforce, to comply with terms of the bailout.  “This restructuring is not only an attack to the
employment of the financial sector, but to the economic growth
of Spain,” COMFIA General Secretary Jose Maria Martinez said at
the news conference.  Branches in  Madrid , Valencia, Segovia, Avila, Las Palmas,
Logrono and Barcelona are urged to participate in the general
strike, Martinez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
