The euro may strengthen 2 percent
against the  Swiss franc  if it rises beyond an area of so-called
resistance, UBS AG said, citing trading patterns.  If the euro can climb past last week’s high of 1.2569
francs, it will appreciate toward 1.2662, the 38 percent
retracement of its decline from October 2007 and August 2011,
said  Richard Adcock , a technical strategist in London, citing
Fibonacci analysis. Any decline will be limited by support at
1.2379 francs, the 38 percent retracement of this month’s
advance, Adcock wrote today in a note to clients.  “Once the break of 1.2569 francs is seen, the move to
1.2662 will be within a couple of days,” Adcock said in an
interview confirming the contents of the note. “If the 1.2379
support does give way it’ll be a deeper sell-off but the bullish
themes will remain.”  The euro weakened 0.3 percent to 1.2411 francs as of
10:32 a.m. London time after appreciating to 1.2569 on Jan. 18,
the strongest level since May 20, 2011. The currency has climbed
2.8 percent against the franc this year.  Resistance refers to an area on a graph where analysts
expect sell orders to be clustered. Support is where they may be
orders to buy. Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that
prices rise or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high
or low.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
