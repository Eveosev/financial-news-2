Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  agreed to take a 50
percent stake in a wind park being built off the coast of the
Netherlands, the second wind-energy investment in northwest
Europe by Japan’s biggest trading group in less than a week.  Construction of the 129-megawatt Eneco Luchterduinen
project, 23 kilometers (14 miles) offshore in the Dutch North
Sea, will begin in July 2014, according to an e-mailed statement
from Eneco Group, the Rotterdam-based utility that’s leading the
project, which will be operational after the summer of 2015.  The Dutch government is expanding wind capacity to reduce
the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels and emissions of
 greenhouse gases . The cabinet that took office in November has
committed itself to boosting the share of renewable sources in
power production to 16 percent by 2020, from about 11 percent in
2011. Mitsubishi also announced Jan. 16 it was investing 576
million euros ($766 million) to aid  Germany ’s shift to renewable
energy in a partnership with grid operator Tennet Holding BV to
connect sea-based wind farms to the power network.  “Mitsubishi Corp. will continue to seek other
opportunities to expand its participation in environmentally
friendly infrastructure projects worldwide,” Nobuaki Kojima,
Mitsubishi’s executive vice president for global environment and
infrastructure business development, said in today’s statement.  The 43 model V112 turbines to be provided by  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  of Denmark for the Luchterduinen project will
provide enough power for 150,000 households, Eneco said in the
statement. No financial details were disclosed. Dutch daily
newspaper De Telegraaf reported today that the wind park will
involve a total investment of as much as 500 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
