GET Baltic, a joint venture of
 Lietuvos Dujos AB (LDJ1L)  and Finland’s Gasum Oy that plans to create a
Baltic natural gas exchange, began trading of the fuel in
Lithuania.  Starting today, Internet trading will be held weekdays
between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., the Vilnius, Lithuania-based
company  said  on its website. Four companies have signed up to
trade and accords with several others are in progress, it said.  Lithuania joins hubs in the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany,
France and Austria, where growing volumes of traded gas are
challenging Russian export monopoly  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s preference for
long-term contracts tied to the price of oil. Trading began on
an exchange in neighboring Poland Dec. 20.  Lietuvos Dujos owns 66 percent of GET Baltic’s shares.
Gasum, an Espoo, Finland-based company that operates the
country’s natural gas network, holds the remaining 34 percent.  Lithuania  is splitting ownership of the sales and
transmission activities of Lietuvos Dujos, a utility controlled
by Germany’s  EON AG (EOAN) , Gazprom and the Lithuanian state as part of
a European Union drive to force dominant energy companies to
improve access for competitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
