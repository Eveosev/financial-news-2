Acciona SA (ANA) , the Spanish company that
treats water for six million people a day, said it won a seven-
year contract worth at least $200 million to expand the Fujairah
desalination plant in the United Arab Emirates.  The contract from Emirates SembCorp Water & Power Co., a
public-private company made up of the Abu Dhabi Water &
Electricity Authority and Singapore’s  SembCorp Industries Ltd. (SCI) ,
allows the company based in Madrid’s Alcobendas suburb to
design, build and operate the plant, whose capacity will
increase by 30 percent to 592,000 cubic meters a day.  The plant will take about 28 months to build and serve a
population of about 600,000, Acciona said in a statement. The
contract comes after the company announced a 14 million-euro
($19 million) award from Saudi Arabia’s state water utility to
operate wastewater treatment plants between Jeddah and Mecca.  The UAE has a 10.5 billion-euro, four-year investment plan
to build water treatment plants. The  Middle East  and North
Africa region is the globe’s most water-scarce area, home to 6.3
percent of the world’s population yet only 1.4 percent of its
freshwater, according to data last week from the International
Water Summit in  Abu Dhabi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
