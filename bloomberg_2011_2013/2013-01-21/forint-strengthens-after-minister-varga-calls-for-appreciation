The forint gained after a government
minister said he supported appreciation and as an index of
 Hungary ’s economic-sentiment improved to a nine-month high.  Hungary’s currency appreciated as much as 0.4 percent and
traded 0.1 percent stronger at 292.9 per euro by 3:50 p.m. in
Budapest. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
were little changed at 6.33 percent.  The government targets a forint rate of 285 per euro as
that level helps both exporters and foreign-currency debtors,
 Mihaly Varga , the minister in charge of international aid talks,
said in an interview with ATV yesterday. The budget for 2013 was
based on that  exchange rate , which remains the “right and
realistic target,” Varga said.  “The minister confirmed the market’s view that the
government can’t aim to unnecessarily weaken the forint as that
would narrow its own room for maneuver,” Gergely Toth, an
analyst at Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report
today. Varga’s comments may boost the forint this week, Toth
said.  The forint slumped 2 percent after Economy Minister  Gyorgy
Matolcsy  wrote on Jan. 10 that he opposed strengthening the
currency to fight inflation, in his weekly column in Heti Valasz
newspaper. The currency rebounded 0.9 percent last week after
Varga said Jan. 16 that the forint should be stable between 275
to 285 per euro.  The country’s economic-sentiment index was at minus 19.6,
compared with minus 21.2 in December, as consumers became less
pessimistic, the GKI research institute in Budapest said in an
e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
