Four tankers are waiting at
Novorossiysk,  Russia ’s largest commercial port, to pick up crude
cargoes after storms delayed shipments, according to OAO
Transneft.  The first tanker in five days loaded on Jan. 20 during an
easing of winter storms on the  Black Sea  before the weather
worsened, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for the pipeline operator,
said today by phone from Moscow. The shipment was for 80,000
metric tons. The storms are expected to last until Jan. 23,
Dyomin said from Moscow.  Novorossiysk was scheduled to load six consignments of
Urals crude totaling 605,000 tons from Jan. 15 to Jan. 21, a
final loading program obtained by Bloomberg on Dec. 28 showed.  Transneft jointly owns 50.1 percent of Novorossiysk port
with Summa Group. Loading programs are monthly schedules of
crude shipments compiled by field operators to allow buyers and
sellers to plan their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
