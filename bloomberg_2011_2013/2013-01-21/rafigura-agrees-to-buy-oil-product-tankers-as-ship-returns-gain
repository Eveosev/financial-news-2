Trafigura Beheer BV agreed to buy
three medium-range tankers to carry refined oil products such as
gasoline, its first purchase of vessels in the class, as
earnings for the ships rise.  The tankers have been put on subjects, meaning the
transaction is not yet final, Victoria Dix, a Geneva-based
spokeswoman for the company, said today by e-mail. She declined
to say which unit of Trafigura, the third-largest independent
oil trader, agreed to buy the ships or to confirm their value.  Returns for product tankers are gaining as ships hauling
cargoes of crude oil generate weaker earnings. Daily returns for
medium-range vessels climbed 6.5 percent to $16,000 since the
start of the year, according to data from the London-based
Baltic Exchange, while very large crude carriers, the biggest
 oil tankers , are losing $3,890 a day.  Trafigura paid between $60 million and $70 million for the
vessels, according to Clarkson Plc’s Shipping Intelligence
Network, which cited shipbrokers it didn’t identify. The tankers
were built between 2008 and 2009 and each has a capacity of
about 50,000 deadweight tons, it said.  Each medium-range ship would normally carry about 37,000
metric tons of cargo, or about 315,000 barrels. Clarkson is the
world’s biggest shipbroker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
