Palm oil climbed for a second day on
speculation that shipments from  Malaysia , the world’s second-
biggest producer, may rebound after announcing a zero export tax
for a second month to trim record inventories.  The contract for delivery in April climbed as much as 1.2
percent to 2,428 ringgit ($804) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, before trading at 2,424 ringgit at 12:11
p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures rose 1.4 percent last week, the
first such advance in three weeks.  Exports from Malaysia, the biggest producer after
Indonesia, fell 17 percent to 830,830 tons in the first 20 days
of this month from from a month earlier, according to surveyor
Intertek. This compares with a 25 percent decline in the first
10 days of January and a 21 percent drop in the first 15 days,
Intertek estimates show. Malaysia will maintain the zero tariff
for crude  palm oil  exports in February to draw down inventories,
which stood at 2.63 million tons in December.  “Buyers may be returning to the market after the year-end
holiday,” said Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte Ltd. in Singapore. “They’re slowly getting accommodated to
the new rules in China and the new tax in India.”  India will impose a tax of 2.5 percent on crude palm and
soybean oil imports, the  Agriculture Ministry  said Jan. 17.
China’s quality watchdog, the General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, toughened inspections on
imports from Jan. 1 to improve food safety.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May was little changed at
6,748  yuan  ($1,085) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for September rose 0.6 percent to 8,838 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
