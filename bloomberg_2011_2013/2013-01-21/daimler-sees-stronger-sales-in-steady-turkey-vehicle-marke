Mercedes-Benz Turk AS, the Turkish
unit of  Daimler AG (DAI) , expects “stronger” car and van sales this
year in a market that is forecast to be stagnant, according to
Wolf-Dieter Kurz, the unit’s chief executive.  Mercedes-Benz Turk, which makes buses and trucks at two
plants in  Turkey  and sells imported Daimler cars and vans, plans
to invest about 40 million euros ($53 million) at its factories
in Istanbul and Aksaray this year, about the same as last year,
Kurz said at a news conference in Istanbul today. Mercedes-Benz
sold a record 39,852 new vehicles in Turkey in 2012, including
12,730 cars, up from 38,291 a year earlier, he said.  “We will introduce new sedan and commercial models in
Turkey this year and therefore we expect a stronger market for
us,” Kurz said. Exports from Turkey, where more than two-thirds
of motor vehicles produced are sold abroad, will have a “more
challenging year” because of the debt crisis in Europe.  Turkey, a hub for manufacturers including  Fiat SpA (F) ,  Ford
Motor Co. (F)  and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  produced 1.07 million
vehicles last year, 10 percent less than a year earlier,
according to the country’s Automotive Manufacturers’
Association. Output fell because of declining demand in Europe
and a tax increase on some cars, according to the group.  Daimler, based in Stuttgart, Germany, doesn’t plan to make
cars and vans in Turkey, Kurz said. Car and van sales declined
10 percent in the country last year, Mustafa Bayraktar, head of
Turkey’s Association of Automotive Distributors, said on Jan. 7.  Mercedes-Benz aims to increase its market shares in the bus
and truck market in Turkey, from 65 percent and 45 percent,
respectively, Kurz said.
