German banks will cut jobs in
administrative roles and largely spare their  consumer-banking 
operations as they anticipate growth in that business over the
next six months, an Ernst & Young LLP survey found.  Support positions will be among the hardest hit, said 71
percent of respondents in  Germany  and 58 percent in the rest of
 Europe , the study found. Only 14 percent of German executives
said retail banking will bear the brunt of cuts, while 39
percent of their European colleagues noted that business as an
area job reductions will center upon,  Ernst & Young  said.  Banks saw demand for their services drop off as clients
from private investors to institutional money managers shied
from transactions amid the sovereign-debt crisis. Most German
lenders expect their prospects in consumer banking to improve
while 30 percent or more of respondents anticipate trading,
dealmaking and the sale of securities for companies will suffer,
according to the New York-based consultant’s study.  Banks will set aside more funds for risky loans, according
to 46 percent of German bank executives and 45 percent of their
European peers.  German bankers are more pessimistic about their country’s
economic prospects, with 48 percent saying it will weaken and an
average 41 percent of executives in other countries holding that
their economies will worsen.  Ernst & Young surveyed 269 European firms in the last two
months of 2012, including 50 German lenders representing more
than 40 percent of the country’s banking assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
