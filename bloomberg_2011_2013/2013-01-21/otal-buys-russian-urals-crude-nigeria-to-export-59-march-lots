Total SA bought a cargo of Russian
Urals crude for delivery to northwest  Europe , the first trade in
four weeks. Chevron Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc offered
 North Sea  Forties at a higher differential that the last deal
without finding buyers.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, is scheduled to
export 59 crude cargoes in March, partial loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg show.  North Sea  Chevron offered Forties lot F0217 for loading Feb. 8 to
Feb. 10 at a 50 cent premium to Dated Brent, without finding a
buyer, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts pricing window showed. The lot had been advanced by 16
days, the third February cargo to be brought forward, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Shell didn’t find a buyer for consignment F0208 loading
Feb. 11 to Feb. 13 at plus 55 cents a barrel, according to the
survey. Those offers compare with a Jan. 17 trade at a 20 cent
premium to the benchmark.  Total bid unsuccessfully for the blend loading Feb. 5 to
Feb. 7 at 55 cents more than the benchmark and also for one from
Feb. 7 to Feb. 12 at plus 40 cents, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose 7 cents to 47 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for March settlement traded at $111.64 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $110.86 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $110.70, a discount of 94 cents to March.  The Brent pipeline system was pumping at 80,000 barrels a
day, 10,000 barrels a day below capacity, operator Abu Dhabi
National Energy Co. PJSC said in a statement today. The
Cormorant Alpha platform, where an oil leak was found on Jan.
14, remains shut, it said.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total bought 100,000 metric tons of Urals from Statoil ASA
for loading Feb. 2 to Feb. 6 at a 90 cent discount to Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, according to the Platts
survey. That compares with a trade on Dec. 24 at $1.30 less than
the benchmark.  The Paris-based company also failed to find a seller for a
lot loading Feb. 10 to Feb. 14 at 85 cents less than the
benchmark, the survey showed.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed 3 cents to minus 30 cents a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the least since Dec. 21. In
northwest Europe, the  discount  narrowed to $1.10 from $1.17
yesterday, the data showed.  Russia will export 21 cargoes of 100,000 tons each of Urals
from the Baltic port of Primorsk from Jan. 31 to Feb. 11,

100,000 tons from Jan. 31 to Feb. 10, the plan showed.  TNK-BP sold a cargo of Urals for loading next month from
Novorossiysk to Shell, according to four traders with knowledge
of the matter.  Shell bought the 140,000 ton shipment for loading Feb. 7 to
Feb. 8, the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  OAO Zarubezhneft awarded its tenders to sell 321,000 tons
of Urals to Glencore International Plc, according to three
people with knowledge of the matter.  The company offered 246,000 tons to be loaded once a month
in lots of 82,000 tons and 75,000 tons to be shipped in lots of
25,000 tons, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential. The shipments are for
loading from the Baltic port of Primorsk in the first quarter.  Loadings at Novorossiysk were delayed amid bad weather,
according to Transneft official. The port loaded its first crude
tanker in five days yesterday during easing of winter storms on
 Black Sea , Igor Dyomin, a company spokesman, said today by
phone, adding that four tankers await loading.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 1 cents to $2.14 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Daily exports of Nigerian crude in March are scheduled to
be 1.77 million barrels, according to the plans, which exclude
seven grades. Total shipments for next month are planned at 2.16
million barrels a day, the full schedule for February showed.  The country will ship 12 consignments of Qua Iboe grade,
