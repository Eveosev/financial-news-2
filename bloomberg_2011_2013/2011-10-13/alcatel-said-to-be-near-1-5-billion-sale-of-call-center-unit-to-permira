Alcatel-Lucent SA, the Franco-
American manufacturer of networking gear, is close to a deal to
sell its Genesys call-center software unit to Permira Advisers
LLP, two people familiar with the process said.  The unit may fetch $1.5 billion and an agreement may be
announced next week, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. Alcatel-Lucent,
based in Paris, in July began a review of “strategic options”
for its enterprise communications division, of which Genesys is
a part.  Chief Executive Officer Ben Verwaayen is selling assets as
he concludes a three-year turnaround plan at Alcatel-Lucent,
created with the 2006 merger of Alcatel SA and Lucent
Technologies. Last year, Alcatel sold its vacuum technology unit
for 200 million euros ($275 million), after divesting a stake in
the aerospace company  Thales SA (HO)  in 2009.  Verwaayen is focusing on selling networking gear to
telecommunications operators like  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , an
industry in which it competes with  China ’s Huawei Technologies
Co. and Ericsson AB. Alcatel-Lucent hasn’t reported an annual
profit since 2005.  News of Alcatel-Lucent and Permira nearing a deal to sell
the Genesys unit was reported earlier by Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
