Ghana ’s economy may expand 8 percent
to 12 percent next year as  Africa ’s newest oil exporter expects
rising output of crude to boost revenue, said Deputy Finance
Minister Seth Terkper.  “Oil revenue will be significant,” he said in an interview
in Accra, the capital, yesterday. The forecast is greater than
the International Monetary Fund’s 7.3 percent growth for 2012
made last month. This year, growth is seen at 13.5 percent, the
fastest rate in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the Washington-
based lender. The Ghana Statistical Service gave a provisional
projection yesterday of 13.6 percent.  Production at Ghana’s Jubilee oil field began in December,
the country’s first output of crude for export, propelling
growth to a rate of 31 percent in the first three months of this
year and 34 percent in the second quarter, the Ghana Statistical
Service said Sept. 22.  A target to produce 120,000 barrels a day by the end of the
year may not be met, according to the  Finance Ministry . The
output forecast is likely to be met next year, adding the
delayed revenue to the country’s economy, Terkper said.  The West African nation wants to sustain the 12 percent
growth rate beyond next year by “adding value to our crude,”
Terkper said.  In August, Ghanaian lawmakers approved a $3 billion loan
from the  China Development Bank , $800 million of which will be
spent on developing a natural-gas industry in the country’s
Western region. Ghana has 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas
reserves, Nana Asafu-Adjaye, managing director of the Ghana
National Petroleum Corp., said Oct. 6.
