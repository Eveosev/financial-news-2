U.S. stocks fell, paring gains from
the best Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rally over seven days since
2009, amid lower earnings from  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and concern
equities rose too much on optimism about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Stocks trimmed losses as chipmakers in the  S&P 500  added
1.9 percent and Yahoo! Inc. rose as much as 3.8 percent after
people with knowledge of the matter said KKR & Co. and
Blackstone Group LP are among firms considering bids for the
company. JPMorgan dropped 4.8 percent after reporting a 33
percent profit decline, excluding a $1.9 billion accounting
benefit, as investment banking and trading income slumped.  The S&P 500 retreated 0.3 percent to 1,203.66 at 4 p.m. New
York time, paring its loss from 1.4 percent. It had rebounded
9.8 percent from a 13-month low on Oct. 3 through yesterday. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  decreased 40.72 points, or 0.4
percent, to 11,478.13 today. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed
0.6 percent, rallying a fourth straight day.  “It’s hard to find a port in the storm,”  Barry James , who
helps oversee $2.5 billion as president of James Investment
Research in Xenia,  Ohio , said in a telephone interview. “The
announcement today doesn’t make it any better for the banks. We
keep getting this back-and-forth in Europe. We’ve had a nice run
in stocks and people are taking a bit off the table.”  The S&P 500 rose 4.5 percent over the previous three days
after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said European leaders
would do “everything necessary” to ensure banks have adequate
capital. The rebound had yet to bring the gauge out of a price
range where it’s traded for more than two months. The index has
fluctuated between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71 since Aug. 5.  Technology Rally  Technology shares in the S&P 500 rose 1 percent. At 4:29
p.m., following the close of exchanges,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  added 5.4
percent and Nasdaq-100 Index futures climbed 1.3 percent after
the world’s most-popular search engine beat profit estimates.  Yahoo added 1 percent to $15.93 during the regular trading
session. KKR and Blackstone may become part of a consortium that
would pool the financing needed for a bid, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the review is preliminary and
the firms may decide not to make an offer.  “We’re in a bottoming process,” Bruce McCain, who helps
oversee $22 billion as chief investment strategist at the
private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland , said in a phone
interview. “The question becomes: Do I risk sitting on the
sidelines as this thing begins to take off on me?”  Harm to Banks  U.S. equities followed European stocks lower as the
 European Central Bank  said the involvement of the private sector
in euro-area bailouts through enforced investor losses is a risk
to financial stability and would have “direct negative
effects” on the banking sector. Pacific Investment Management
Co. Chief Executive Officer Mohamed A. El-Erian said European
leaders are beginning to recognize the need for Greek
bondholders to take bigger losses than previously agreed.  “There’s no way to sugarcoat this,” Daniel Genter, who
oversees about $3.7 billion as president of RNC Genter Capital
Management in  Los Angeles . “It’s going to take some pretty
severe medicine to solve Europe’s debt crisis.”  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  slumped 2.9 percent. JPMorgan fell 4.8
percent to $31.60 after revenue at its investment-banking unit
fell 13 percent from the second quarter as concern that  Greece 
would default and U.S. lawmakers would fail to raise the debt
ceiling roiled markets during the third quarter. The firm said
the division will face similar market conditions for the rest of
the year.  BofA, Citigroup  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest U.S. lender by assets,
dropped 5.5 percent to $6.22.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  declined 5.3
percent to $27.64.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to
the economy declined 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones Transportation
Average retreated 0.6 percent.  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  lost 1.7 percent to
$73.87.  General Electric Co. (GE)  decreased 1.1 percent to $16.22.  The threat of a bear market is receding after the S&P 500
rallied the most in 31 months, leaving the gauge about 1 percent
away from a level where two advances have stopped since August.
The measure climbed 1 percent yesterday. Gains were reduced in
the last hour of trading yesterday after the S&P 500 climbed
past 1,220, just above levels reached on Sept. 16 and Aug. 31
when declines began.  The lowest prices relative to earnings since 2009 and a
shortage of better investment options have boosted equities,
according to David Spika, who helps oversee $14 billion as an
investment strategist at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in  Dallas .  “It wasn’t going to take much good news to drive the
market higher,” Spika said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“You had 30-year Treasuries yielding less than 3 percent, 10-
year Treasuries yielding less than 2 percent, and stocks trading
at 11 times earnings. You have to believe that at some point
it’s not going to take much for investors to get back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
