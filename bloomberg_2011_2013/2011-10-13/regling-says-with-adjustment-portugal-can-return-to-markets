European Financial Stability
Facility head Klaus Regling said that “with a lot of
adjustment”  Portugal  should be able to return to markets.  Regling, speaking today in Lisbon, said that Portugal isn’t
where Ireland is now. He said Portugal’s adjustment started six
months after that of Ireland.  Portugal “has a very good chance to implement reforms,”
he said. “I’m hopeful that Portugal can become the second
success story.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
