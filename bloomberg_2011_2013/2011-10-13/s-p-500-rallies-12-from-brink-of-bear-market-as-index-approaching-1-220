The threat of a U.S.  bear market  is
receding after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied the most
in 31 months, leaving the gauge about 1 percent away from a
level where two advances have stopped since August.  The benchmark measure for American common equity climbed 1
percent yesterday, giving it a 9.8 percent increase over seven
days, the most since March 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Gains were reduced in the last hour of trading
yesterday after the S&P 500 climbed past 1,220, just above
levels reached on Sept. 16 and Aug. 31 when declines began, the
data show. The S&P 500 trimmed its advance to 12 points from 25.  Financial, energy and mining companies have led the advance
since shares bottomed Oct. 3, rising at least 12 percent on
signs  Europe  is containing its debt crisis. The lowest prices
relative to earnings since 2009 and a shortage of better
investment options have boosted equities, according to David Spika, who helps oversee $14 billion as an investment strategist
at Westwood Holdings Group Inc. in  Dallas .  “It wasn’t going to take much good news to drive the
market higher,” Spika said yesterday in a telephone interview.
“You had 30-year Treasuries yielding less than 3 percent, 10-
year Treasuries yielding less than 2 percent, and stocks trading
at 11 times earnings. You have to believe that at some point
it’s not going to take much for investors to get back.”  Treasury Yields  Benchmark yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries reached a
record low of 1.6714 percent on Sept. 23 while 30-year yields
slipped to 2.6922 percent on Oct. 4. The  S&P 500  trades for 10.9
times 2012 profit estimates, compared with a five-decade average
of 16.4 times reported earnings, Bloomberg data show.  The S&P 500 closed at a one-month high of 1,207.25
yesterday after European Commission President  Jose Barroso 
called for the reinforcing of banks, the payout of a sixth loan
to Greece and a faster start for a permanent rescue fund.
Minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Sept. 20-21 meeting
showed some members argued for keeping more asset purchases as
an option for stimulating the world’s biggest economy.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent to 1,203.66 at 4 p.m. New
York time today.  The seven-day rally in the S&P 500 trimmed its loss since
April 29 to 11 percent from more than 19 percent on Oct. 3.
Financial institutions, energy producers and mining companies
led the advance. Among those industries, 30 stocks jumped at
least 20 percent, including Zions Bancorporation, Tesoro Corp.
and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.  Bear Markets  Indexes for 37 out of 45 developed and emerging markets
have tumbled 20 percent this year from their peaks, the common
definition of a bear market. The S&P 500 was as much as 21
percent below its highest closing level of 2011 on Oct. 4 before
a 12 percent rally through yesterday’s close began.  Stocks are unlikely to fall all the way back to the
intraday low of 1,074.77 on Oct. 4, according to  Michael Shaoul ,
chairman of Marketfield Asset Management in New York. That’s
partly because levels of investor anxiety measured by the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index have retreated.
The VIX slipped 4.9 percent yesterday to the lowest level since
September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The likelihood of a full retest of the correction lows
now seems significantly less probable than a few days ago,”
Shaoul wrote in an e-mail yesterday. “We say this not only
because of the distance we have moved away from the 1,075 low,
but also because we are finally seeing signs of a forcible
unwind of the ‘fear trade.’”  Slowing Volume  Volume slowed in the past four days. Since U.S. equity
losses intensified after the S&P 500 high on July 22, trading on
days the index rises has averaged 9.02 billion, compared with
9.66 billion on days the measure fell, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Volume hasn’t exceeded 9 billion since Oct. 6.  “It’s a pretty panicky market,” Jason Brady, a managing
director at Thornburg Investment Management Inc., who helps
oversee about $73 billion from  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico , said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “There’s not a lot of liquidity
out there, there’s not a lot of certainty in any pricing. Little
changes in sentiment can move prices a lot.”  “I’m not sure the world has changed that much in the last
five or six days that 10 percent is really a reasonable change
in the price of those risky assets,” he said.  Default Concern  The S&P 500 has fluctuated between 1,074.77 and 1,230.71
since Aug. 5 as optimism about corporate earnings had alternated
with concern  Greece  will default on its debt. Profits for S&P
500 companies probably rose 12 percent in the third quarter and
are forecast to rise 18 percent to a record $99.86 a share in
2011, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Daniel Genter, who oversees about $3.7 billion as president
of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital Management, said the S&P
500 faces further “resistance” at 1,250.  “It’s going to be a positive if we break through” 1,220,
Genter said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The problem is
that there is so much volatility, except for that downside
support level at around 1,100, which we’ve tested several times,
the upside is a little more nebulous just because it’s been all
over the place.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
