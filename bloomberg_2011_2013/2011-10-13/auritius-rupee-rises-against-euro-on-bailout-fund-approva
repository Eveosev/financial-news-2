Mauritius’s rupee strengthened
against the euro, the currency of its main trading partner,
after Slovakia said it will approve the Eurozone’s bailout fund.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to 39.8199
per euro and traded 0.4 percent up at 39.8872 by 1:15 p.m. in
Port Louis, the capital, paring this month’s decline to 2.9
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the
dollar, the main currency for the country’s import bills, the
rupee was unchanged at 29.  Slovakian political leaders secured backing for the
European Financial Stability Facility yesterday in Bratislava,
and approval will follow by tomorrow at the latest, completing
the ratification process in the eurozone prior to the region’s
leaders meeting later this month.  “The European leaders have so far well handled the current
situation,” analysts at  Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) , the
country’s largest lender by market value, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients today. “European Union officials” are “coming
up with plans to save the day.”  Europe  is the Indian Ocean island nation’s main source of
tourism and largest buyer of manufactured goods, data from the
Statistics Mauritius show. Revenue in euros represents 41
percent of the nation’s foreign currency income, according to
Bank of Mauritius.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 28.0098 rupees to
28.1777 and the selling price retreated to 29.5083 compared with
29.6162 yesterday, according to  exchange rates  published today
on the Bank of Mauritius website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
