A former Citadel LLC employee was
charged with stealing  trade secrets  from the Chicago-based
investment firm.  Yihao “Ben” Pu, 24, was arrested yesterday and faces as
long as 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted,
U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in  Chicago  said today in a
statement.  Citadel hired Pu last year to help develop proprietary-
trading strategies for the $11 billion hedge fund. Citadel
officials allegedly discovered Pu copying company data onto a
removable storage device, according to the U.S.  “Pu was attempting to construct a trading strategy similar
to the one used by Citadel,” Fitzgerald said, citing evidence
recovered in the investigation. Citadel sued Pu in Illinois
state court in August.  Pu made an initial appearance yesterday before U.S.
Magistrate Judge Maria Valdez. He is being held in federal
custody while awaiting a detention hearing scheduled for
tomorrow, according to prosecutors.  Robert Greenspoon, the attorney representing Pu in the
civil suit, today declined to comment on the criminal
allegations. Greenspoon, who appeared in court with Pu
yesterday, said he won’t be the lead defense
counsel in the criminal case.  Devon Spurgeon, a spokeswoman for Citadel, declined to
comment on the case.  The criminal case is U.S. v. Pu, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago). The civil case is
Citadel LLC v. Pu, 11CH30493, Cook County, Illinois, Circuit
Court,  Chancery Division  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
