The Bank of England said 8 percent
2021 U.K. government bonds are excluded from its debt-purchase
program until further notice because it owns more than 70
percent of the so-called “free float” of the securities.  The central bank also said it won’t buy 1.75 percent bonds
due in 2017 and 4.25 percent securities maturing in 2039 because
they are due for auction within a week of the purchase
operation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
