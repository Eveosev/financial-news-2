China , the second-biggest corn
grower, may boost output this year by 3.9 percent to a record of
184.5 million metric tons, the China National Grain & Oils
Information Center said in an e-mailed report today.  The forecast is 2 million tons more than a previous
projection made by the state-owned researcher, according to
calculations by Bloomberg News. Output may reach a record 182.5
million tons, the center’s Director Shang Qiangmin said Sept. 5.  Soybean output this year may plunge 10.5 percent to 13.5
million tons, while wheat may gain 1.4 percent to 116.8 million
tons, the center’s report today said.  The following lists production and area numbers. Units are
