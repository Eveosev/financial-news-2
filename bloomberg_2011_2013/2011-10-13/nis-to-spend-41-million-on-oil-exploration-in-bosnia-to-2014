Naftna Industrija Srbije AD said it
has earmarked $41 million for oil and gas exploration in
neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina through 2014.  The search in two areas in Republika Srpska, the Serb half
of Bosnia, will cover 700 square kilometers (272 square miles),
NIS said today in an e-mail. It secured the license in early
July and expects to spend 4.05 million euros ($5.55 million) on
the project this year.  The Belgrade-based company, majority owned by OAO Gazprom
Neft, formed a joint venture with a unit of OAO Zarubezhneft
Neftegazinkor to search for hydrocarbons in Republika Srpska,
which gave them a 28-year concession, three years for
exploration and 25 years for tapping any commercial finds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
