European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said cutbacks alone are not enough to tackle the debt
crisis.  “To focus solely on cuts suggests that government
overspending was the only source of the crisis,” Barroso said
at a Friends of Europe conference in Brussels today. “The
commission does not believe cutbacks are the solution.”  “Confidence is now the most important capital,” Barroso
said. “And is now in short supply.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
