Iran reported two outbreaks of
deadly bird flu in farm ducks, according to a notice by the
Ministry of Agriculture published by the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health, or OIE.  The outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza was first
confirmed on Sept. 15 and was reported to the OIE today, the
animal-health group said in an alert on its website. The disease
killed 345 free-range ducks in two outbreaks, and a further
2,337 of the birds were destroyed, according to the
notification.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
