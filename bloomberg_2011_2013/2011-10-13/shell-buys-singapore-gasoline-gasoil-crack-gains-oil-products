Royal Dutch Shell Plc boosted its
gasoline purchases in  Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading
center. Gasoil’s crack spread widened, and fuel oil’s discount
to crude narrowed.  Light Distillates  Shell bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline in Singapore
from Total SA at $125.30 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
The cargo is for loading from Nov. 2 to Nov. 6. Shell,  Europe ’s
largest oil company, has purchased at least 750,000 barrels of
gasoline since Sept. 29, a day after a fire at its Pulau Bukom
refinery in Singapore.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
increased $7.60 to $73.74 a metric ton at 5:40 p.m. Singapore
time, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, was at $37.89 on Oct. 11, the
narrowest since May 2009.  Middle Distillates  BP Plc sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5
percent sulfur to Hin Leong Trading Pte in Singapore, according
to the Bloomberg survey. The price was 40 cents a barrel over
benchmark quotes, a reduced premium from 50 cents in a
transaction yesterday. The cargo is for Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, the
earliest loading period.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude climbed 40
cents to $15.70 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. Singapore time, based on
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread
widened for the first time in three days.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil dropped 15 cents to $2.25 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade is the lowest so far in October,
indicating it is becoming less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of jet fuel to BP at 10 cents a
barrel over quotes, the survey showed. The cargo will load Nov.
3 to Nov. 7.  Fuel Oil  Hin Leong bought 380-centistoke fuel oil in Singapore for a
second day, according to the Bloomberg survey. The closely held
trader paid $8 a ton over October quotes to Lukoil OAO and BP
for 20,000 tons each for loading Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. Yesterday,
Hin Leong paid an $8.50 premium.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 53 cents to
$2.96 a barrel at 2:06 p.m. Singapore time, PVM data showed.
That’s the smallest gap since Oct. 4, signaling reduced losses
for refiners turning crude into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 25 cents to $8 a ton. A narrowing viscosity
spread means higher-quality fuel oil has declined less than
bunker, or marine fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
