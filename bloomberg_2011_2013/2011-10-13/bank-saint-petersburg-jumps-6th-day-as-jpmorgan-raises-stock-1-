Bank Saint Petersburg rose for a
sixth day, its longest winning streak in more than a month after
the Russian lender was upgraded by JPMorgan Chase & Co. to
“overweight” from “neutral.” The share price may climb 125
percent from current levels, JPMorgan said in an e-mailed note
today.  The stock rose as much as 14 percent and closed up 7.7
percent at 94.10 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
