Amaranth Advisors LLC, the hedge
fund that collapsed in 2006 after losing $6.6 billion on natural
gas trades, tentatively settled a class-action lawsuit in which
it was accused of market manipulation, according to a filing in
 Manhattan  federal court.  U.S. District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin said in an order
Oct. 5 that the parties in the case had reached an agreement. In
August 2009, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced
that Greenwich, Connecticut-based Amaranth paid $7.5 million to
settle allegations that the hedge fund tried to manipulate
natural gas futures three years earlier.  In April, the  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  issued a
$30 million civil penalty against Amaranth trader Brian Hunter,
who was accused of manipulating the natural gas market in 2006.  Hunter’s attorney,  Michael Kim , didn’t return calls seeking
comment. Chris Lovell, an attorney for the plaintiffs at Lovell
Stewart Halebian LLP in New York, and Stephen Senderowitz, a
lawyer for Amaranth at Winston & Strawn LLP in  Chicago , declined
to comment. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Nov. 30.  The case is In Re Amaranth Natural Gas Commodities
Litigation, 07-06377, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
