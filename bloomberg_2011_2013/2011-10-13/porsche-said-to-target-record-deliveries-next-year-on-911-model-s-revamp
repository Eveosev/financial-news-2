Porsche AG, the maker of the Cayenne
sport-utility vehicle, plans to sell a record 140,000 cars next
year on demand for the next generation of the 911 and Boxster
models, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  The Stuttgart, Germany-based carmaker aims to increase 2012
deliveries after selling 120,000 autos this year, the person
said, declining to be identified discussing internal goals.
Porsche, which sold 97,000 vehicles last year, said previously
it would deliver “more than” 100,000 cars in 2011.  “The goal seems ambitious given the current economic
framework but it’s achievable,” said  Daniel Schwarz , a
Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG analyst who recommends buying the
stock. “Porsche is performing very solidly in key markets. A
lot depends on how the new 911 will fare and how quickly they’ll
bring derivatives to market.”  Porsche, which aims to combine with Volkswagen, will begin
selling the revamped version of the iconic 911 this December and
plans to offer an updated Boxster model in the first half of
2012, the person said. Porsche and rival German luxury-car
makers have thus far been immune to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  September Sales Rise  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ,  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz and
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi all posted September sales advances and are
targeting record deliveries in 2011. Porsche said yesterday that
sales last month surged 38 percent to 10,560 vehicles on demand
for the Cayenne SUV. Nine-month deliveries are up 31 percent.  Porsche dropped as much as 2.7 percent to 37.50 euros and
was down 1.6 percent at 1:38 p.m. in Frankfurt trading, valuing
the carmaker at 11.6 billion euros ($16 billion).  Porsche plans to increase production of the Cayenne, its
best-selling model, by between 10 percent and 20 percent
starting in January by adding a third shift at a factory in
Leipzig,  Germany , where the vehicle is produced. Porsche
currently makes about 220 cars a day at the plant and has been
unable to keep up with demand for the model.  “Even if economies happen to cool down somewhat, I’m very
confident that we have a chance to keep growing next year thanks
to our global presence and current product portfolio,” Porsche
sales chief Bernhard Maier said in a Sept. 13 interview at the
Frankfurt auto show.  Backed by VW, Porsche aims to double sales to at least
200,000 cars and SUVs by 2018. The carmaker will add a compact
SUV and a limited series of the 918 Spyder hybrid sports car by
2013. Porsche’s current models include 911, Boxster/Cayman,
Panamera and Cayenne. Porsche may also develop a supercar
positioned higher than the 237,600-euro 911 GT2 RS, its most
expensive 911, Maier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
