year of sales, a Deutsche Bank analyst estimated today.  Electric Spark sales may reach 20,000 in 2014, Dan Galves,
who is based in New York, wrote in a research note. Detroit-
based GM said yesterday that  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)  will supply the
car’s batteries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
