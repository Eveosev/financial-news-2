Argentine opposition lawmakers said
consumer prices rose 1.9 percent in September, according to an
average estimate by private researchers.  Prices rose 24 percent from a year earlier, lawmaker
Patricia Bullrich said during a news conference today in  Buenos
Aires .  Opposition lawmakers began releasing private estimates of
consumer prices in June after the government of President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  fined researchers who said
inflation was more than double the official figure.  The National Statistics Agency is scheduled to release
Septemberâ€™s consumer price index on Oct. 14 at 3 p.m. New York
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
