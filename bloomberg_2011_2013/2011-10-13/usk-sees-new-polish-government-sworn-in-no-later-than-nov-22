Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
said today he has reached an understanding with President
Bronislaw Komorowski that the latter will set a timetable for
convening parliament allowing Tusk’s new cabinet to be sworn in
no later than Nov. 22.  This schedule will permit the incumbent government to stay
in office until Nov. 20 or Nov. 22 and prevent disruption of
 Poland ’s stint in the European Union’s rotating presidency, Tusk
told reporters at a news conference in Warsaw.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
