Michael Ashcroft, former deputy
chairman of British Conservative Party, sued the British
Broadcasting Corp. over a “Panorama” television documentary
about his stock ownership and tax affairs.  Ashcroft, a former board member at  Tyco International Ltd (TYC) ,
filed the lawsuit against the BBC on Oct. 10 in  London ,
according to court documents.  The documentary scrutinized Ashcroft’s business interests
in Belize and his offshore tax status. Its October 2010
broadcast was delayed by two weeks amid objections from
Ashcroft.  While details of the claim haven’t been released by the
court, BBC spokeswoman Helen Deller said the lawsuit was over
the episode of “Panorama.” She declined to comment further.  Alan Kilkenny, a spokesman for Ashcroft, didn’t respond to
an e-mail requesting comment.  Ashcroft, a member of the U.K. House of Lords, has sued
other media companies that investigated his financial holdings.
He said on his  website  that he sued the  Times newspaper  in
London in 1999 and filed a suit against the Independent in 2009,
according to court records.  As chairman and chief executive officer of ADT Ltd., he
negotiated its sale to Tyco International for $6.7 billion in
1997, his website said. Ashcroft was deputy chairman of the
Conservative Party between 2005 and 2010.  The case is: The Lord Ashcroft KCMG v. British Broadcasting
Corp., HQ11X03768,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s Bench
Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
