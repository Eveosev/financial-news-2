Europe  can act decisively to address
the debt crisis without going through the lengthy process of
amending the European Union’s treaties, European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  said.  “It would be a complete mistake to suggest that the
solution to the current problem is a treaty change,” Barroso
said at a Friends of Europe conference in Brussels today. “We
have decisions we can take now. And by now I mean: now.”  Barroso said he remains open to considering treaty changes
in the “medium term.” Such a step would be required to launch
“fully fledged euro bonds,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
