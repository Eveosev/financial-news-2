The U.S. and European Union
financial systems are connected by the swaps market,  Gary Gensler , head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
said in a speech in  London  today.  “The current debt crisis in  Europe  is but a stark reminder
of our interconnectedness,” Gensler said. “Central clearing is
essential to protect banks customers as much as it is to protect
the taxpayers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
