Ecom Agroindustrial Corp., a
supplier of commodity raw materials, increased a one-year credit
line by 51 percent to $530 million after lenders offered more
than it sought.  The revolving credit can be extended by one year, and will
help the Pully, Switzerland-based company replace its $220
million and 91 million-pound ($143 million) 364-day facilities
maturing this year, according to a statement today from lenders.  ABN Amro Bank NV and Credit Agricole CIB arranged the deal
that was increased from $350 million when they started marketing
it at the end of August, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
