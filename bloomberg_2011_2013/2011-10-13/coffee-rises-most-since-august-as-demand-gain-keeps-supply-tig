Coffee futures rose the most since
August on signs of increased demand, including from  Brazil , the
world’s largest grower and exporter.  Inventories at European ports fell by 0.1 percent to 13.64
million bags as of Aug. 31, the European Coffee Federation said
today. While farmers in Brazil may harvest a record crop in
2012, an exporter group said shipments in the past 12 months
through September jumped 11 percent from a year earlier. The
Brazilian Association of Coffee Industries forecasts domestic
consumption may grow more than 4.7 percent.  “Even if Brazil comes out with a huge crop, as many
expect, that would just be enough to meet export obligations and
internal demand and replenish some of the dwindling
inventories,” Marcio Bernardo, an analyst at Newedge Group in
 New York  said in a telephone interview.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 3.6 percent to
settle at $2.3765 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest gain for a most-active contract since Aug. 17.  Global coffee consumption rose 2.3 percent to 135 million
bags in 2010, with usage in exporting countries jumping 4.2
percent, the  International Coffee Organization  said on Oct. 11.
Growth in importing countries was 1.5 percent, according to the
ICO.  The commodity has gained 28 percent in the last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
