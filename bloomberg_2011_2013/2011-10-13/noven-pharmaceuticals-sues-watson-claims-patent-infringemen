Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co.’s Noven
Pharmaceuticals unit sued  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  to prevent
it from selling a generic version of Daytrana, a skin patch for
children with attention deficit disorder.  Watson is seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval to sell a copy of Daytrana, according to the complaint
filed today in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Miami-based
Noven said the Watson version would infringe two patents and
seeks a court order to prevent sales until the patents expire in
2018.  Under federal drug law, the filing of the lawsuit prevents
the FDA from granting Watson final approval for 30 months unless
a court rules in the generic-drug maker’s favor before then.  “We are challenging the patents on the product,” said
Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, in a phone interview. He declined to comment further.  The case is Noven Pharmaceuticals v. Watson Laboratories,
U.S. District Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
