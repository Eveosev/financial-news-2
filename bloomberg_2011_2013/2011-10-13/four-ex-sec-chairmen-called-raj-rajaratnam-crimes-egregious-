Four former chairmen of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission wrote to U.S. District Judge
Richard Holwell yesterday arguing against Raj Rajaratnam’s
request for leniency at his sentencing today.  William Donaldson, Roderick Hills,  Harvey Pitt  and David
Ruder submitted a joint letter to the court, saying, “We
strongly believe that there is a need for this court to impose a
sanction commensurate with the defendant’s egregious criminal
activity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
