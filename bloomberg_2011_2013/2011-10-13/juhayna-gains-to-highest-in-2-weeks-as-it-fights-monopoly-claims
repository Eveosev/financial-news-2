Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) ,  Egypt ’s
biggest producer of packaged milk, rose the most in six months
after filing documents with Egypt’s antitrust commission in
response to claims of monopolistic practices.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 4.8 percent, the
most since April 13, to 4.82 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 2.6 percent.
The documents filed by Juhayna defend against allegations it is
not paying a fair price for raw milk from farmers,  Al Alam Al
Youm  reported today. The company agreed with farmers to link the
milk price to what the farmers pay for fodder, the Cairo-based
newspaper cited Juhayna’s deputy financial manager Sameh El Hudeibi as saying.  “From the company’s communications and financials, it is
evident they are not paying a fixed price for raw milk, which is
what some of the farmers are claiming,” said Shaymaa El Nemr,
an equity analyst at Cairo-based Pharos Holding who has a
“hold” rating on the stock. “The fluctuation in the price
they are paying farmers supports the company’s position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
