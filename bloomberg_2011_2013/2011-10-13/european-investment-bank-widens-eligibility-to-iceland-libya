The  European Investment Bank  said
Iceland,  Libya , Iraq and Cambodia have been added to the list of
countries eligible to receive loans, under a newly adopted
mandate that takes effect Nov. 1.  The Luxembourg-based EIB will have access to an additional
1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion), including 1 billion euros for
“southern Mediterranean countries undertaking political
reforms.” The new scope also includes 2 billion euros for
climate-related action, on top of the EIB’s existing financial
capacity of 25.8 billion euros, the bank and the European
Commission said in a statement.  The new mandate “should be instrumental to help EIB to
take part in our joint efforts to provide support to our
Mediterranean partners in their democratic transition process
and more generally to support pre-accession and partner
countries to withstand the crisis,” said European Union
Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  in the statement.  The EIB is the EU’s arm for financing investment projects
like energy and road networks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
