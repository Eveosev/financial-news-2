Hurricane Jova killed four people in
 Mexico ’s Jalisco state after coming ashore early yesterday,
while Irwin weakened to a tropical depression from a storm.  Landslides killed a 21-year-old woman and a young girl in
Cihuatlan and two people in Jose Maria Morelos village, the
Jalisco state authorities said yesterday in a  website  statement.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center stopped issuing advisories on
Jova late yesterday after the storm weakened to a remnant low.  Irwin became a depression late yesterday, according to the
hurricane center. It’s packing winds of 35 miles (55 kilometers)
per hour and forecast to weaken to a remnant low today off
Mexico’s Pacific coast, more than 200 miles west-southwest of
Manzanillo, the NHC said in an advisory at 5 a.m. Miami time.  The center late yesterday also issued its last advisory on
the 12th depression of the Pacific Hurricane season, which
weakened to a remnant low over southern Mexico, 95 miles east-
northeast of Salina Cruz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
