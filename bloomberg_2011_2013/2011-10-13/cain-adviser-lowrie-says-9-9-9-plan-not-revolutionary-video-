Rich Lowrie, senior economic adviser
to Republican presidential candidate  Herman Cain , talks with 
Bloomberg's Mark Niquette about the so-called 9-9-9 tax plan he 
developed for Cain.  Cain has moved to the Republican race's top tier in part 
because of the plan, which would tax sales transactions at 9 
percent along with business and individual incomes. (Source:
