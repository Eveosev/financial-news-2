Tanzania’s shilling weakened,
heading for a sixth week of decreases against the U.S. currency
as oil importers and food companies increased demand for dollars
before a public holiday tomorrow.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy traded
down 0.4 percent at 1702.5 per dollar by 12:46 p.m. in Dar es
Salaam, the commercial capital, taking its retreat so far this
week to 0.4 percent.  “The oil sector came in aggressively in the morning and
bought dollars,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader with National Bank of
Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian unit, said by phone
today from Dar es Salaam. “We also saw customers from foods and
beverages demand dollars.”  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in
August, on higher energy and food costs, the National Bureau of
Statistics said Sept. 15. The currency has lost 13 percent
against the dollar this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
