U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed concern today
whether the Pentagon can afford all three models of the  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT)  F-35 jet.  “Three variants creates some fiscal challenges for us,”
Dempsey said in his first congressional testimony since becoming
chairman.  “I’m concerned about the three variants and about whether
we can afford all three,” he told the House Armed Services
Committee about the $382 billion program, the Pentagon’s most
expensive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
