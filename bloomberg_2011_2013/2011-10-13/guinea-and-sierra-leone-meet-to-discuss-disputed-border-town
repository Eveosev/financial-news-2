Sierra Leone ’s president, Ernest Bai Koroma, will meet his counterpart from neighboring Guinea,  Alpha Conde , for talks about the disputed border town of Yenga, which
both of the West African countries claim.  The leaders will also discuss security and trade in the
Mano River Union group of countries, which includes Ivory Coast
and Liberia, according to a statement e-mailed from Koroma’s
office in Freetown today.  Defense Minister Paolo Conteh will discuss with officials
Guinea’s military occupation of Yenga, which was in Sierra
Leonean territory before its civil war that ended in 2002, said
Joseph Kamanda, the online media officer in Sierra Leone’s
