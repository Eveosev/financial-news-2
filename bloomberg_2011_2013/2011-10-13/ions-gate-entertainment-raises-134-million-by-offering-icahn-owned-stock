Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF) , the
producer of the television drama “Mad Men,” sold $134 million
of shares owned by activist investor  Carl Icahn  after putting
the offering on hold earlier this month.  The company arranged the sale of 19.2 million shares owned
by funds affiliated with Icahn for $7 each, according to a
statement. Icahn funds own about 3.1 percent of Lions Gate
common shares after the offering, the company said.  The sale helps resolve a court dispute spurred by Icahn’s
hostile pursuit of the independent film and TV studio. Lions
Gate agreed to help sell the shares for $7 each, or 1.4 percent
less than yesterday’s closing price of $7.10. The company won’t
receive any proceeds, according to the statement.  Icahn owned about 17 percent of the common shares before
the offering, according to a regulatory filing. The planned sale
was pushed back after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dipped to
its lowest level in a year on Oct. 3, a person familiar with the
transaction said at the time.  Lions Gate fell 0.6 percent to $7.06 at 11:11 a.m.  New York 
time. Piper Jaffray Cos. of Minneapolis led the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
