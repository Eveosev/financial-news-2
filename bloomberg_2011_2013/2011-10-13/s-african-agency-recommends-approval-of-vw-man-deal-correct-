(Corrects headline to show that deal still needs to be
approved by the Competition Tribunal.)  South Africa’s Competition
Commission said it has recommended to the country’s Competition
Tribunal that it approve the proposed transaction between
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  MAN SE (MAN)  without conditions.  “The Competition Commission assessed the South African leg
of the deal and concluded that it was unlikely to lead to a
substantial lessening of competition,” the Tribunal said in an
e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
