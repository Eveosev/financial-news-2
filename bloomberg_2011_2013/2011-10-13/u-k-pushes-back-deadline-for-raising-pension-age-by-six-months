The U.K. government will push back
its target date for raising the state pension age to 66 by six
months to October 2020 to help women who faced seeing their
retirement postponed by two years.  The Pensions Bill, currently going through Parliament,
increases the age at which women receive their pensions to 65
from 60 starting in November 2018. Two years later, the pension
age for both men and women will go up to 66.  “We have listened to the concerns of those women most
affected by the proposed rise in state pension age to 66 and so
we will cap the increase to a maximum of 18 months,” Pensions
Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said in an e-mailed statement in
 London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
