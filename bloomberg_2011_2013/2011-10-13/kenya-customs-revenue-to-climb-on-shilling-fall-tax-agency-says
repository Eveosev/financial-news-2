Kenya ’s customs income will probably
increase this year because of the depreciation of the shilling,
Michael Waweru, the commissioner general of the  Kenya Revenue
Authority .  Customs income accounts for 37 percent of the East African
nation’s total revenue, Waweru told reporters today in Nairobi,
the capital.  Kenya’s shilling is the worst-performing currency against
the dollar this year, losing 22 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
