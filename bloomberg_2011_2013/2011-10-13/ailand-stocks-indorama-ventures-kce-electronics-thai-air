Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Thailand trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 1.7 percent to 936.82.  Aapico Hitech Pcl (AH TB), an auto-parts maker, fell 5
percent to 8.65 baht, the lowest level since June 8, 2010. The
company said flooding in Ayutthaya province forced it to close a
plant.  KCE Electronics Pcl (KCE)  , a producer of electronics
parts, slid 12 percent to 3.84 baht, extending yesterday’s 9.6
percent slide. A plant in Ayutthaya has been ordered by the
government to remain closed for safety reasons because of
flooding, KCE said in a regulatory filing today.  Thai Airways International Pcl (THAI)  , the national
carrier, fell 5.2 percent to 20.2 baht, the biggest drop in more
than a week. The company said it may fill about 70 percent of
its seats in the fourth quarter this year, compared with 74
percent a year earlier, because of  Europe ’s debt crisis and
increased competition. High  oil prices  will also erode revenue
in the last quarter, Executive Vice President Pandit Chanapai
said.  Thai Rubber Latex Corp. ( Thailand ) Pcl (TRUBB TB), a rubber
producer, increased 1.9 percent to 3.18 baht. Rubber in Tokyo
climbed for a third day on concern that floods in Thailand, the
largest producer, may disrupt supply of the commodity used in
tires and gloves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
