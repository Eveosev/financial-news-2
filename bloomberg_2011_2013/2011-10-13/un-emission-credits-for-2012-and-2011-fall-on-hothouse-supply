United Nations Certified Emission
Reduction credits for 2011 dropped to a record low amid rising
supply and slowing industrial production.  Credits for December 2011 slumped as much as 5.3 percent to
7.15 euros ($9.82) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London and were at 7.28 euros as of 4:06 p.m. local
time. European Union allowances for December dropped as much as
3.6 percent to 10.31 euros.  “We’ve got a lot of carbon around,”  Trevor Sikorski , an
analyst for  Barclays Plc (BARC)  in London, said on Bloomberg
Television’s “On the Move” with  Owen Thomas . “It’s been a
little bit of a hothouse of supply coming in against very, very
moderate demand and that has pushed prices down.”  Carbon prices in the UN-administered market have fallen 36
percent so far this year, undermining the profitability of wind
farms and other emission-reduction projects in developing
nations that rely on CERs for revenue.  CERs for December next year, a more widely held futures
contract, declined to a record 7.32 euros earlier today.  Factories and power stations in the EU program, the world’s
biggest carbon market, can use some UN offset credits for
compliance, cutting their costs.  Australia  is also considering
allowing CERs within the country’s own  emissions-trading  system
that it expects to start in July.  The UN market has supplied about 253 million tons of new
CERs so far in 2011, nearly double the 132 million supplied all
of last year.  ‘Near the Bottom’  CERs are created under the UN’s Clean Development
Mechanism, where projects cut emissions in  China ,  India  and
other nations, assuming they win approval from UN-overseen
regulators based in Bonn. Facilities must comply with rules of
the 1997  Kyoto Protocol , which caps emissions in 37 developed
nations through 2012.  London-traded UN credits on ICE are “probably near the
bottom” because they are close to the minimum prices set in
primary supply contracts with projects, said Marcelo Labre, a
visiting fellow at  London  Business School who teaches energy,
carbon finance and emissions trading.  At secondary-market prices below 7 euros, “most holders of
CERs just don’t sell them, with the effect of keeping prices
around the current level,” Labre said today by e-mail after the
price plunged. That’s assuming holders have enough working
capital without additional sales, he said. CERs for December
2009 on ICE dropped as low as 7.15 euros on Feb. 12, 2009.  Shares Fall  Trading Emissions Plc, a developer of clean energy
projects, said Oct. 10 it needed to retain cash as collateral
for forward sales of credits and it may not have enough reserves
to pay dividends. The shares fell as much as 5.6 percent today
to 51 pence in London, near a record 48 pence reached on Oct. 4.  “We should see an accelerated devaluation when we get
closer to May 2013,” when use of credits from cutting some
industrial gases is halted under EU rules,  Emmanuel Fages , an
analyst in Paris for Orbeo, the emissions venture of Societe
Generale SA and Rhodia SA, said yesterday. “The clock is
ticking against them.”  Lawmakers earlier this year banned use of some credits in
the EU market, including the most plentiful hydrofluorocarbon-23
offsets, after April 2013. Until then, those credits are
eligible for delivery on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
