Spain ’s bank-rescue fund sold 1.4
billion euros of bonds ($1.9 billion) in its first issue since
it agreed to inject 7.6 billion euros into failed savings bank
Caja de Ahorros del Mediterraneo and three other lenders.  Fondo de Reestructuracion Ordenada Bancaria’s two-year
bonds were priced to yield 92 basis points more than Spanish
government debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. FROB,
as the fund is known, raised 2.2 billion euros in July from
five-year bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Bank of Spain said Sept. 30 it will take over banks run
by CaixaCatalunya, Novacaixagalicia and Unnim Banc after the
lenders failed to boost capital reserves with private-sector
investment. The central bank seized Caja de Ahorros del
Mediterraneo in July, and FROB agreed to inject capital worth
2.8 billion euros.  Bankia SA,  Barclays Capital , Credit Agricole CIB, Banco
Santander SA and Societe Generale SA managed today’s bond sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
