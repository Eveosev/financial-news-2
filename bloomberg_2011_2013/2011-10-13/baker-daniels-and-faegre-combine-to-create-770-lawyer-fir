Baker & Daniels LLP and Faegre &
Benson LLP merged to create the 42nd-largest  law firm  in the
U.S. with 770 lawyers.  “The size and added capabilities of the combined firm will
give us the ability to devote more resources to larger projects,
bring deeper and broader experience to complex matters and
transactions, and provide greater expertise in certain niche
areas,” Tom Froehle, chief executive partner of Indianapolis-
based Baker & Daniels, said yesterday in a  statement .  The merged firm, to be known as Faegre Baker Daniels, will
begin operations on Jan. 1, according to the statement. It will
maintain 13 offices throughout the U.S., China and the U.K.  Andrew Humphrey, Minneapolis-based Faegre & Benson’s
managing partner, will keep his title, while Froehle will serve
as chief operating partner, according to the statement.  The Baker & Daniels consulting operation, B&D Consulting,
which employs 45 consultants, will be known as FaegreBD
Consulting. Its 770 lawyers would make the merged firm 42nd in
the 2011 rankings compiled by the Internet Legal Research Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
