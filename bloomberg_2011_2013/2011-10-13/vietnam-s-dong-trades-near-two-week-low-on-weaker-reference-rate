Vietnam ’s dong traded near a two-
week low as the central bank lowered its daily reference rate
for the fifth time this month.  Government bonds  rose.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the reference rate at
20,678 per dollar, compared with 20,668 yesterday, according to
its website. The dong is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate and can move outside the band in the so-
called black market.  “Lots of maturing foreign-currency loans in the fourth
quarter would also put pressure on the foreign-exchange
market,” Luu Hai Yen, a Hanoi-based fixed-income analyst at
Thang Long Securities, wrote in a research note obtained today.
Yen didn’t specify the amount that falls due.  The dong traded at 20,880 per dollar as of 2:50 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,873 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency dropped to as low as 20,884,
the weakest level since Sept. 29.  The yield on the government’s five-year bonds fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.40 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
