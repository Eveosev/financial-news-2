Ethanol gained for the third time in
four days as U.S. production and stockpiles declined, according
to an Energy Department report.  The biofuel gained 0.5 percent as stockpiles slid 2.7
percent to 16.9 million barrels from 17.3 million the previous
week, the second consecutive drop, government data show. Output
fell 0.3 percent to 860,000 barrels a day in the week ended Oct.
7, the fourth decline in five weeks.  “You’ve seen demand start to get a little stronger,”
 Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments Inc.
in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  Denatured ethanol for November delivery gained 1.3 cents to
settle at $2.64 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $6.3825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Corn, the primary ingredient in U.S.-made ethanol, is the
nation’s largest crop, valued at $66.7 billion last year,
according to USDA data. The grain has fallen 16 percent since
the end of August.  “With the price drop in corn, the farmers harvesting this
corn are not too excited about selling it,” Ward said. “The
fact that the price has come down is great for ethanol plants,
but not if the farmers don’t sell it. They’re kind of in a tug
of war right now.”  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  was unchanged
at $2.825 a gallon, and on the West Coast the biofuel declined
1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $2.84, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf fell 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$2.625 a gallon, and in Chicago the additive declined 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.665, Bloomberg data show.  Gasoline for November delivery rose 0.88 cent to settle at
$2.7575 a gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated
gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
