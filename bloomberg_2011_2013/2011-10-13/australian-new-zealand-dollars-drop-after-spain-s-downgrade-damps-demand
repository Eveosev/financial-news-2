Australia ’s dollar fell from a
three-week high against its U.S. counterpart after Standard &
Poor’s cut Spain’s long-term sovereign credit rating, damping
demand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s currency and the so-called Aussie declined
against the yen for a second day as S&P 500 futures signaled the
U.S. stocks gauge may drop. China, Australia’s biggest trading
partner and New Zealand’s second-largest export market, will
report today inflation figures for September.  “I don’t think the market’s out of the woods yet,” said
 Thomas Averill , a director at foreign-exchange and interest-rate
risk management company Rochford Capital in Sydney. “The Aussie
may be sold quite aggressively overnight.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.3 percent to $1.0161 at 10:19
a.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it touched $1.0233, the
highest level since Sept. 21. Australia’s currency slid 0.3
percent to 78.17 yen. The  New Zealand dollar  declined 0.3
percent to 79.28 U.S. cents, and weakened 0.3 percent 60.99 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
