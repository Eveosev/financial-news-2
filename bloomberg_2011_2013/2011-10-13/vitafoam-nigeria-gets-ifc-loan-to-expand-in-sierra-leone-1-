Vitafoam Nigeria Plc (VITAFOAM) , a foam-
products manufacturer, received a $2.8 million loan from the
International Finance Corp. to help it expand in the West
African nation of  Sierra Leone , an official said.  The loan will go to Vitafoam Sierra Leone, a newly created
subsidiary of the Lagos-based company, Mary Agboli, the World
Bank unit’s representative in Sierra Leone, said in a phone
interview today from Freetown, the capital.  “One of the things the loan will do to the country is that
it will give other investors the right signal that Sierra Leone
is ready for new investors,” Agboli said. IFC officials and the
management of Vitafoam signed the loan agreement yesterday in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, she said.  Sierra Leone is rebuilding its economy nine years after the
end of a civil war that destroyed most of the country’s
infrastructure. The loan is the IFC’s fist investment in Sierra
Leone’s manufacturing industry since the civil war ended,
according to Agboli.  “The country’s manufacturing sector is small, with very
little manufacturing taking place, but government has
streamlined the processes to prepare the environment for
investment,” she said.  There are investment opportunities in agriculture,
manufacturing and mining, according the IFC representative.
Sierra Leone, one of the world’s poorest countries, has deposits
of solid minerals including  iron ore , gold and rutile, which is
used in titanium dioxide, a material used in the manufacture of
paints and pharmaceuticals, Agboli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
