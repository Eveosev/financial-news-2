India ’s food inflation rate exceeded
9 percent for a third straight week, sustaining pressure on the
central bank to maintain its tight monetary policy stance.  An index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural
products gained 9.32 percent in the week ended Oct. 1 from a
year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a statement in New
Delhi today. It rose 9.41 percent the previous week.  India’s inflation needs to ease before  interest rates  can
be cut, central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday as
he called for higher supplies. India’s June-September monsoon
rainfall, the main source of irrigation in the country, was 1
percent above average this year, according to the weather
office, boosting farm prospects.  “There is no doubt inflation still remains a concern,”
said  Dharmakirti Joshi , a Mumbai-based economist at Crisil Ltd.,
the local unit of  Standard & Poor’s . He expects the central bank
to boost its repurchase rate by a quarter of a percentage point
to 8.5 percent in the next policy decision on Oct. 25.  The yield on the 7.8 percent government bond due April 2021
was unchanged at 8.73 percent at 12:36 p.m. in Mumbai. The BSE
India Sensitive Index rose 0.2 percent, and the rupee was little
changed at 48.97 against the dollar.  In the week ended Oct. 1, food inflation slowed as onion
costs dropped 10.2 percent from a year earlier, today’s report
showed. Prices of wheat fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
