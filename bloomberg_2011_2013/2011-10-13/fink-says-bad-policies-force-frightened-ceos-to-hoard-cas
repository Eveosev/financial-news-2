Laurence D. Fink, chief executive
officer of  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest asset-management
firm, said poor policy making from  Washington  is forcing
companies to hoard cash in what he calls a “vast de-risking”.  “Our corporations have not been in this good a shape in
tens and tens of years, they’re sitting with trillions of
dollars of cash and they’re frightened,” Fink said today at a
Financial Times conference in  New York . “The average CEO does
not know how to plan out five years with this political
uncertainty.”  Fink, 58, who co-founded BlackRock in a one-room office in
Manhattan in 1988, said the behavior by politicians in August as
they debated whether to raise the U.S. debt ceiling was “un-
American and unbecoming.” Rising public debt and “greater
policy-making uncertainty” prompted  Standard & Poor’s  to
downgrade U.S. long-term debt to AA+ from AAA in August.  “This is a vast de-risking,” Fink said. “It is the
default mechanism of a frightened outlook.”  BlackRock manages about $3.66 trillion in assets for
institutions and individuals through separately managed
accounts, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
