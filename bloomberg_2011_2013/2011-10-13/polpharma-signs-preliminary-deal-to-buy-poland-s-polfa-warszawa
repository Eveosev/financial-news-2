Polpharma SA, a Polish drugmaker,
signed a preliminary deal with state-owned PHF SA to buy
competitor Polfa Warszawa SA, Ewa Wilcz-Grzedzinska, PHF’s
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  Polpharma, which was picked for exclusive talks last month
after Iceland’s Actavis Group hf withdrew from the process, is
“likely” to sign the final agreement to purchase Polfa in
December, PHF said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
