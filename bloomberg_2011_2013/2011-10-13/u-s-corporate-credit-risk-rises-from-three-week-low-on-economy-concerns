A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk rose from the lowest level in three weeks as  China ’s
export growth slowed, reviving concern that the global economy
may falter.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.2 basis points to a
mid-price of 132.5 basis points at 8:19 a.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, reached 130.3 basis
points yesterday, the lowest level since Sept. 20. The swaps
index had decreased from 150.1 on Oct. 3 as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region’s sovereign debt
crisis.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
