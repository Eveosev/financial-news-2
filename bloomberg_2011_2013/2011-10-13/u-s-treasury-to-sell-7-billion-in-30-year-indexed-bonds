The  U.S. Treasury  Department will
sell $7 billion in 29-year 4-month inflation-indexed bonds at
next week’s auction.  The bonds will carry an original issue date of Feb. 28,
2011, settle Oct. 31, 2011 and mature Feb. 15, 2041. The CUSIP
number, or identification, will be 912810QP6.  Inflation-indexed securities are intended to provide
investors with a hedge against inflation. The securities rise or
fall in value with movements in the government’s consumer price
index, with a three-month lag.  The securities also let the Treasury lower its cost of
borrowing in periods of tame inflation.  Known as TIPS, or Treasury Inflation Protected Securities,
the notes and bonds are sold quarterly in a variety of
maturities.  Inflation adjustments are added to the principal and are
payable at maturity. The value of the bonds will never drop
below the originally issued principal if consumer prices fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
