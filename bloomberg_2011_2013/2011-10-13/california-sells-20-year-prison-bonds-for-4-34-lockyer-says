California sold $490.4 million of
tax-exempt bonds to finance prison construction, with yields
0.29 percentage point less than similar debt offered last year.  The most-indebted U.S. state offered the lease-revenue
bonds with yields ranging from 1.25 percent on two-year
securities to 5.34 percent for debt maturing in 2031, Treasurer
Bill Lockyer said yesterday in a statement.  When California sold $450 million of similar public works
lease-revenue bonds in March 2010, 20-year bonds were priced to
yield 5.63 percent.  Lockyer is selling $2 billion of general-obligation bonds
Oct. 19, the second such offering since Sept. 20. The state had
suspended sales earlier in the year to curb borrowing costs as
lawmakers worked to complete the budget.  Individual investors ordered 29 percent of the lease-
revenue bonds, according to Lockyer’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
