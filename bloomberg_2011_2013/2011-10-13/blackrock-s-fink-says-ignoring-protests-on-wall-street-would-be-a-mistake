BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Laurence D. Fink,
head of the world’s largest asset manager, said he’s
“encouraged” by the protests on Wall Street and ignoring them
would be a mistake.  “I’m surprised it hasn’t happened sooner,” Fink said
today at a conference in New York organized by the Financial
Times. “We’ve had protesting in the name of the  Tea Party  on 
the right side, and now we’re having protesting from the left 
side. Maybe we’re going to get some balance this way. But I 
do believe that we should not turn our backs to this 
protesting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
