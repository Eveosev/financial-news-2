The U.S. commercial-paper market
fell for a 13th week, the longest streak in at least a decade,
as investors reduced holdings of financial debt on concern that
 Europe ’s fiscal crisis may infect bank balance sheets.  Corporate borrowing through short-term IOUs fell $19.1
billion to $966.3 billion in the week ended Oct. 12 on a
seasonally adjusted basis, the  Federal Reserve  said today on its
website. That’s the lowest level since reaching $916.8 billion
on Jan. 19, according to Fed data compiled by Bloomberg.  Borrowing by domestic financial institutions led the
decline even as concern eased this week that turmoil in Europe
will spread globally. U.S. money market funds are still shunning
banks’ commercial paper, said Raymond Stone, an economist at
Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton,  New Jersey .  “It is possible that some of the concern about contagion
from Europe is influencing the perceived creditworthiness of the
holding companies of the U.S. banks,” Stone said.  Commercial paper sold by domestic banks and financial firms
fell $16.2 billion to $298.2 billion in the biggest decline
since June 15. The amount issued by non-U.S. financial
institutions decreased $2.1 billion to $177.1 billion, the sixth
weekly decline and the lowest level in 13 months.  Corporations sell commercial paper to fund everyday
activities such as paying payroll and rent. The weekly decline
marks the longest stretch since at least December 2000,
according to the Fed data.  Commercial paper issued by non-financial companies rose
$1.1 billion to $185.1 billion, the Fed said. Domestic non-
financial IOUs rose $800 million to $143.7 billion, the second
weekly rise and the highest
level in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
