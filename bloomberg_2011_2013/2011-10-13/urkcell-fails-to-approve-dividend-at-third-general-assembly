Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS,
Turkey’s largest mobile-phone company, couldn’t approve a
proposed dividend of 75 percent from 2010 profit after
shareholders failed to pass financial statements at an
extraordinary assembly yesterday, according to a company
statement.  Agreement wasn’t reached on key items in the meeting late
yesterday following a prolonged dispute over management between
the company’s largest shareholders, with Turkey’s Cukurova
Holding AS on one side and  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  of Sweden and  Alfa
Group  of Russia on the other.  TeliaSonera and Alfa Group executives walked out,
instructing their proxy to abstain from voting, Cecilia Edstroem, a spokeswoman for TeliaSonera, said by telephone
yesterday.  Turkcell shares rose 4.6 percent to 8.60 liras on the
 Istanbul Stock Exchange  yesterday, as investors bet the dispute
may be resolved and the dividend paid.  Cukurova is battling with TeliaSonera and Alfa for control
of Turkcell in wrangling that’s escalated to court cases
stretching from Geneva to the Caribbean islands. Yesterday’s
extraordinary meeting had already been scheduled twice
previously.  The non-Turkish shareholders want to replace Turkcell
Chairman Colin Williams, saying he favors the company’s founding
shareholder Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, chairman of Cukurova and
 Turkey ’s richest man.  To contact the reporter on this story:
