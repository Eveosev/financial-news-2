Russia , the world’s biggest oil
producer, may reduce its export duty on most crude shipments by
as much as 4.6 percent on Nov. 1 after  oil prices  fell.  The standard duty will probably decline to within a range
of $392.40 and $393.60 a metric ton ($53.53-$53.70 a barrel),
according to Bloomberg calculations based on  Finance Ministry 
data. That compares with $411.40 a ton in October.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil may be set within a range of $190.30 to $191.10 a ton
compared with $204.50 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals price
from the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, may average $107.93 to
$108.20 a barrel during this monitoring period,  Alexander
Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign off on the levies
for them to come into effect. The Finance Ministry is estimating
November duties using the so-called 60-66 formula, Sakovich
said. The measure applies a coefficient of 60 percent to
calculate the crude duty, down from 65 percent previously, and
unifies the duty on refined products at 66 percent of that levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products may be
decreased to within a range of $259 to $259.70 a ton next month,
down from $271.50 in October.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may fall to within a range of $353.10
to $354.20 a ton, Sakovich said. That is 90 percent of the crude
duty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
