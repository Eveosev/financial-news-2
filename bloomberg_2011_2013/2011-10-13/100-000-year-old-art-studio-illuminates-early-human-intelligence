Ancient artists concocted and stored
a paint mixture in a South African cave 100,000 years ago, a
discovery researchers say proves an earlier human grasp of
chemistry and planning than previously thought.  The materials were discovered in 2008 in Blombos Cave, 300
kilometers (186 miles) east of  Cape Town , according to an
article published online today by the journal Science. Two
paint-making toolkits were found in which  Homo sapiens  mixed and
stored a liquefied combination of ochre, bone, charcoal and
other materials in abalone shells, the researchers said.  The 100,000-year-old toolkits are the earliest evidence to
date of human technology for combining and storing substances
that may have been central to social practices. Possible uses of
the ochre, which the findings suggest was ground to a fine red
powder, mixed with liquid, charcoal and a crushed spongy bone
that may have acted as a binder, include decoration and skin
protection, the researchers said in the paper.  The discovery “casts a whole new light on early Homo
sapiens,” author  Christopher Henshilwood  of the Institute for
Human Evolution at the University of the Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg and University of Bergen in  Norway , said in a
podcast interview with Science. “It tells us that they were
probably a lot more intelligent than we think, and they were
capable certainly of carrying out quite sophisticated acts at
least 40,000 or perhaps 50,000 years before any other known
example of this kind of basic chemistry.”  Other workshops have been dated back to 60,000 years ago,
according to the paper. Older tools for working with ochre had
also been discovered, though scientists still knew little about
how the pigment was prepared and stored, said Francesco
d’Errico, an author of the paper and a researcher at the
University of Bordeaux in  France .  To contact the reporter on this story:
