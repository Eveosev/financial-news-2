Hungary’s financial watchdog,  Pszaf ,
is calling for regulations to limit lenders’ scope to
unilaterally change credit contracts, state news agency MTI
said, citing a Pszaf official.  The body wants lawmakers to allow tighter credit rules for
all types of loans not just household mortgages, Laszlo Balogh,
deputy chief executive at Pszaf, told MTI.  Interest on household loans should be linked to a benchmark
plus premium and banks may be forced to convert their existing
loans to carry benchmark rates, Balogh said, according to MTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
