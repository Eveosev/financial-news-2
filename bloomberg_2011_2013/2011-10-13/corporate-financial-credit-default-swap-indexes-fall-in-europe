The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 10 basis points to 330 at 3 p.m. in London.
An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 20 basis points to 762,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose six basis
points to 178.5.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers climbed 13.5 basis points to 245.5 and the
subordinated index rose 12 basis points to 480.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.7 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
