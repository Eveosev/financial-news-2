Gap Inc. (GPS)  plans to close stores in
the U.S. while expanding its international and online business
and said falling cotton prices will boost its profit margin.  Gap will reduce its North American namesake stores to about
700 by the end of 2013, a 21 percent decrease from the count in
the first half of this year and a 34 percent drop from the end
of 2007, Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Simmons said today at
an investor meeting in  New York . Cotton prices that have
declined since reaching records this year will help increase
profitability, the company said.  “We are focusing on a smaller and healthier fleet in  North
America ,” Simmons said. “Normalizing cotton prices should help
our margins as well.”  The company said it plans to return operating margins to
2010 levels “over time.” Gap’s operating income was 12.8
percent of its sales in its fiscal 2010, according to Bloomberg
data. The measure narrowed to 9.9 percent in the quarter ended
in July.  Gap will also expand the presence of its namesake and
Banana Republic stores in  China , South America and Italy, said
Stephen Sunnucks, president of international operations.  Gap rose less than 1 percent to $17.92 at 4:15 p.m. New
York time. The San Francisco-based company’s shares have
declined 19 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
