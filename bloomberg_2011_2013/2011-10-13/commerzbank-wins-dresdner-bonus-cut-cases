Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest bank, won dismissal of 13 cases filed by former  Dresdner
Kleinwort  investment bank employees over 2008 bonuses at the
country’s top labor court.  The Federal Labor Court in Erfurt said the bank had the
right to cut the bonuses by 90 percent after Dresdner Kleinwort
suffered more than 6 billion euros ($8.2 billion) in losses
during the financial crisis. The court ruled against the bank in
three separate cases that it said were covered by labor
agreements.  Commerzbank was forced to tap Germany for 18.2 billion
euros of capital during the credit crisis and cut 2008 bonuses
for Dresdner employees from a 400 million-euro pool by as much
as 90 percent. The reductions led to dozens of lawsuits in
Germany and  London .  “When determining the bonus in February 2009, the rules of
equitable discretion were kept,” the court said in an e-mailed
statement. “With a view to the losses it wasn’t inappropriate
to considerably reduce the bonus.”  Three cases brought by former Dresdner employees were
granted by the top judges because they were covered by an
agreement brokered by the lender’s works council. Under those
rules, bonuses on average reached one to two monthly payments.
The 2008 were reduced to 1,000 euros which was contrary to the
agreement, the judges said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
