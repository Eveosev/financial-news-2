Slovakia’s parliament approved a
bill on early elections, meeting the opposition’s condition for
it to back an overhaul of the European bailout mechanism.  Lawmakers voted to hold elections on March 10, more than
two years before a regularly scheduled ballot in June 2014. The
move follows the fall of Premier Iveta Radicova’s government,
which lost a confidence motion tied to an Oct. 11 vote on
enhancing the European Financial Stability Facility, the
region’s temporary bailout fund.  Freedom and Solidarity, a junior ruling party, didn’t back
the EFSF overhaul, causing the government collapse. The
remaining three governing partners yesterday agreed with Smer,
the largest opposition party, on early elections in exchange for
its pledge to support of the EFSF in a repeated vote that will
likely take place either today or tomorrow.  Slovakia, the euro region’s second-poorest member, remains
the only country in the 17-member currency union that hasn’t yet
ratified the key element in Europe Union’s plan to prevent
contagion from the debt crisis and uncertainty about the vote
has rattled financial markets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
