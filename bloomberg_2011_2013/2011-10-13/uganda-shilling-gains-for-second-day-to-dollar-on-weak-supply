Uganda ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day against the dollar amid tight supply of the currency
of East Africa’s third-biggest economy.  The shilling appreciated as much as 0.8 percent to 2,852.4
per dollar and traded up 0.7 percent at 2,855 by 2:13 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, after closing at 2,875 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has lost
19 percent this year, making it the world’s second-worst
performer after  Kenya ’s shilling. Uganda’s shilling reached a
record-low 2,897.5 on Sept. 23.  “We are basically seeing weak demand for the dollar
because major buyers are deeming the current rate as high,”
Faisal Bukenya, the head of  currency trading  at Barclays Bank
Uganda Ltd. said by phone from Kampala. “The other problem is
that there is lack of the shilling in the market.”  The central bank raised the key  interest rate  by four
percentage points to 20 percent on Oct. 4 to try to stem
inflation, which accelerated to a more than 18-year high of 21.4
percent in August from 18.8 percent in July, the Uganda Bureau
of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
