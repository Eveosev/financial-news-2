An Angolan court order for a
newspaper editor to pay 10 million kwanzas ($105,000) within
five days or face a year in jail is “illogical,” media-
monitoring group  Reporters Without Borders  said.  A judge in  Angola  sentenced William Tonet on Oct. 10 for a
2008 article in his  Folha 8  newspaper accusing three army
generals and the head of the customs service of embezzlement,
corruption and abuse of authority, the Paris-based group said on
its website.  “The libel has not been proven and the judge was clearly
in league with those suing the journalist, who has been a target
of the authorities for a long time,” said the media group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
