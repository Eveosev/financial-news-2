Brent oil futures settled at a
record premium of $26.88 a barrel above the price of New York-
traded West Texas Intermediate crude today, breaching the
previous high of $26.87 a barrel on Sept. 6.  The record is based on the settlement prices of the oil
futures contracts closest to expiration on  London â€™s ICE Futures
Europe exchange and the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
