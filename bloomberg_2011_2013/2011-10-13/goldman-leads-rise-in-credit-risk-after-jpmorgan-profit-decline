Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  led
increases in the cost of protecting the debt of U.S. companies
on renewed concern that  Europe ’s fiscal crisis will continue to
derail the economic recovery and after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
reported a drop in profit.  Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs added 39 basis points
to 340 basis points, according to data provider CMA. Contracts
on JPMorgan climbed 8 to 142 and those tied to Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world’s largest retail brokerage, increased 29 to
387, the data show.  A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from
the lowest level in three weeks after JPMorgan said revenue at
its investment-banking unit fell 13 percent from the second
quarter amid concern that  Greece  would default and the U.S.
economic recovery was stalling. That overshadowed a report that
applications for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
fell more than expected.  Credit-default swaps on the biggest U.S. banks tend to
swing with  market sentiment , acting as a “bizarre bellwether,”
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit group at DoubleLine
Capital LP, which has $17.5 billion in assets under management,
said in a telephone interview from  Los Angeles . “I still don’t
get a sense that this is over yet in terms of the bank and
finance risk out there.”  Contracts on  Citigroup Inc. (C)  increased 22 basis points to
250 basis points and contracts on  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance
arm General Electric Capital Corp. added 32 to 275. Those on San
Francisco-based  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  climbed 7 to 140.5.  Six Largest Banks  Even with today’s rise, contracts tied to the debt of the
six largest U.S. banks have decreased to 270 basis points from
360 basis points on Oct. 4, CMA data show, as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region’s debt crisis and
investor concern eased that bank balance sheets would be
infected by sovereign defaults. That’s equivalent to an average
of $270,000 to protect $10 million of debt for five years.  JPMorgan swaps have dropped from 185 and  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
credit swaps declined from 650 basis points during the period.  JPMorgan said third-quarter earnings fell to about $3.1
billion, or 73 cents a share, not including a 29 cents
accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on the same basis a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today. Net income was
$4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with the average per-
share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92 cents in a survey of
30 analysts by Bloomberg.  Company Risk Gauge  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 132.6 basis points at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, snapped two days of
declines after dropping from 150.1 on Oct. 3.  Investor confidence in company creditworthiness dropped
even as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000 Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
