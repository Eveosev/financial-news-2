A measure of banks’ reluctance to
lend to one another in  Europe  rose to the highest since Oct. 5,
according to a money markets indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, increased to 76
basis points at 4:18 p.m. in London, from 74 yesterday. The rate
reached 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the widest since March
2009.  The  European Central Bank  said today that forcing investors
to take losses in bailouts would have “direct negative
effects” on banks. European Commission President  Jose Barroso 
will speak today in Brussels after calling yesterday for a
“coordinated approach” to recapitalize the region’s lenders.  “Banks being forced to raise capital levels in the midst
of crisis will result in de-leverage,”  Bill Blain , a strategist
at broker Newedge Group in London, wrote in a note. “Reduced
lending will further damage Europe’s anaemic growth prospects,
thereby exacerbating the sovereign debt crisis.”  A measure of how much European banks pay to fund in dollars
rose. The one-year cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay
to convert euro payments into dollars, was 64.5 basis points
below the euro interbank offered rate from 64 yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was little
changed at 92 basis points under Euribor. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the European Central Bank rose. Banks
parked 105 billion euros ($145 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, down from 62 billion euros on Oct. 11. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 58 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.572 percent from 1.571
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.181 percent from
1.186 percent.  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 25th day to 0.403 percent from 0.401 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 9, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 39 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
