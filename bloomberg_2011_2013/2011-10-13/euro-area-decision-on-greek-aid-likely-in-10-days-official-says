The euro area will probably decide
within 10 days on the next aid payment for  Greece  and plans to
avoid a “credit event” in seeking a higher contribution from
bondholders in a new Greek rescue, a European Union official
said.  The next disbursement would be the sixth under the 110
billion-euro rescue approved last year for Greece by the euro
area and the  International Monetary Fund . The next installment
includes 5.8 billion euros from the euro area and 2.2 billion
euros from the IMF.  Market developments since a second package for Greece was
approved by euro-leaders on July 21 mean it will be more
expensive for creditors, the EU official told reporters today in
Brussels on the basis of anonymity. That 159 billion-euro
package foresaw 50 billion euros from bondholders through debt
swaps and exchanges, which would entail a 21 percent writedown.  In seeking a higher contribution from bondholders, the euro
area will seek to avoid triggering a  credit event  because of the
uncertainty that could result, according to the official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
