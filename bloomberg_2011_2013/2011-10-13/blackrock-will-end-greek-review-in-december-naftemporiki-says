BlackRock Solutions, a unit of
 BlackRock Inc (BLK) , the New York-based money manager, will complete a
review of Greek bank loans in December,  Naftemporiki  reported,
without citing anyone.  The review is likely to find that Greek lenders will need
to add provisions of 15 billion euros for non-performing loans
under a “very extreme scenario,” the newspaper said, citing
estimates of the Greek Bankers’ Association.  Alternatively, bank analysts give a range for further
provisions of between 7 billion and 13 billion euros,
Naftemporiki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
