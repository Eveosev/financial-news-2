Renishaw Plc (RSW)  fell the most in London
trading in more than two years after the U.K. maker of precision
machine tools said revenue in the three months ended Sept. 30
increased less than predicted.  The shares plunged as much as 19 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since March 2009, and were down 17 percent at
850 pence as of 3:27 p.m. The stock has slumped 55 percent since
reaching a record on July 26 and has fallen 24 percent in the
past year.  Revenue in the fiscal first quarter rose 15 percent to 70.5
million pounds ($110.8 million), less than planned, the Wootton-
under-Edge, England-based company said in a statement today
without specifying the figure it had forecast. Pretax profit
fell to 13.6 million pounds from 15.1 million pounds a year
earlier.  “Due to current uncertainties surrounding the global
economy, the board is closely monitoring the group’s costs and
future recruitment strategy,” Renishaw said in the statement.
“Despite near-term challenges caused by the economic
environment, we remain focused on positioning the group for
further long-term growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
