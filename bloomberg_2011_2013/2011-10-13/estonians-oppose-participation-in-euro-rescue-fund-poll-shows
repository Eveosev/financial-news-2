A majority of Estonians oppose their
country’s involvement in the euro area’s temporary bailout fund,
which has channeled aid to Ireland and  Portugal , a poll showed.  Fifty-eight percent of respondents in the poll by Tallinn-
based research company Turu-Uuringute AS said Estonia shouldn’t
guarantee loans made by the European Financial Stability
Facility, while 28 percent favored participation and 14 percent
were undecided. The survey of 998 people, conducted in the
second half of September and published today, had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points.  In an  agreement  on expanding the EFSF, Estonia committed to
guarantee 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) of the fund’s 780
billion-euro capacity. That’s 14 percent of the former Soviet
republic’s  14.3 billion-euro economy . All the euro states except
Slovakia have ratified the changes.  Estonian lawmakers approved the EFSF expansion agreement on
Sept. 29 with the support of 59 lawmakers in the 101-member
legislature. The Turu-Uuringute poll is the first to gauge
public opinion on the issue.  Euro adoption in January has helped  Estonia  distance itself
from all but the strongest European economies in terms of credit
risk. Its robust economic growth in the first half, the fastest
in the 27-member European Union, can at least partly be
attributed to joining the euro, the government and central bank
have said.  Forty-nine percent of respondents in the poll said Estonia
should stick with the euro, while 37 percent supported a return
to the national currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
