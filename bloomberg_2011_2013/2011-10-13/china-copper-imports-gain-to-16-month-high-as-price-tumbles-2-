Copper imports by  China , the biggest
consumer, climbed to the highest level in 16 months in September
as lower prices lured traders to place orders and after domestic
stockpiles were reduced earlier this year.  Inbound shipments of the refined metal, copper alloy and
products rose 12 percent to 380,526 metric tons from 340,398
tons in August, according to data posted on the  website  of the
General Administration of Customs. Imports gained for a fourth
month to the highest level since May 2010, and were 3.3 percent
higher than the 368,410 tons of a year earlier.  Strong Chinese demand may support  London  prices, which
tumbled 24 percent in September, the biggest monthly decline
since October 2008, on concerns that the worsening European debt
crisis could lead to another recession. Buying may continue as
domestic inventories have slumped 45 percent from this year’s
high in March.  “Arbitrage buying should have increased a tad as a result
of favorable price differentials between  Shanghai  and London,”
Peng Qiang, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co., said by phone from
Beijing. “October imports should be even higher.”  Traders profit by exploiting prices differences between two
exchanges, buying in London and selling Shanghai. Inventories at
Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses declined to a three-month
low of 97,911 tons at the end-September. Metal in bonded
warehouses in Shanghai dropped to about 200,000 tons,  Barclays
Capital  said in a report on Oct. 11. That compared with 600,000
to 700,000 tons in March.  Tight Credit  “Better prices encouraged traders to place orders,” said
Zhu Lin, an analyst at data provider SMM Information &
Technology Co. Still, “even if they wanted to import more
aggressively, they don’t have the adequate funds to do so.”  By July, the People’s Bank of China increased  interest
rates  five times and the reserve requirement ratio nine times
since the second half of last year to contain inflation.
Consumer prices probably eased to 6.1 percent in September from
6.2 percent in August, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. The data are scheduled to be
released tomorrow. Consumer prices rose 6.5 percent in July, the
fastest in three years.  “This should impose a cap on imports increase in coming
months,” Zhu said.  Imports of unwrought copper and products in the first three
quarters this year declined 18 percent from a year earlier to
2.73 million tons, according to the customs.  Price Supportive  December-delivery copper in Shanghai was little changed at
54,860 yuan ($8,603) a ton, which includes a 17 percent value-
added tax. The metal for three-month delivery in London fell 1.7
percent to $7,399.75 a ton by 12:08 p.m. Shanghai time, after
dropping as much as 2.3 percent earlier.  The Chinese import data for copper and copper products were
“mildly bullish” for the market, said  David Thurtell , an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  Singapore .  Scrap copper imports totaled 420,000 tons in September,
compared with 380,000 tons a month earlier. Total scrap arrivals
rose 6.7 percent in January-September to 3.43 million tons,
customs data showed.  Imports of unwrought aluminum and products totaled 66,163
tons last month, while exports of unwrought aluminum were at
60,715 tons, according to customs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
