Don’t worry “CrackBerry” addicts, BlackBerry services are being restored, and the co-CEO wants you to know he’s sorry. The service disruptions, which began in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa on Monday and spread to India and then the U.S. late Tuesday, halted messaging and Web browsing and caused a flurry of complaints. The backlash doesn’t bode well for  Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM) , which may face compensation claims from outraged users looking for refunds for lost hours,  Bloomberg News reported today . In New York trading today, RIM closed down 1.1 percent to at $23.61. Mike Lazaridis, the company’s co-CEO,  apologized today  for the frustration. But with competition fierce in the mobile market, will it be enough to calm users disgruntled by the disconnection? (Remember  the Netflix lesson  in CEO apologies?) In the last few days of widespread BlackBerry blackouts, I wonder how many BlackBerry users have been eyeing the new iPhone, set to hit stores tomorrow. Better get in line -- they’re already  sold out for pre-order  at U.S. carriers.
