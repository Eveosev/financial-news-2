Romaniaâ€™s government  approved three
oil and gas concession agreements with Dutch and Romanian
companies that committed to invest at least $140 million in the
eastern European country in the next three years.  The companies can cancel the three concession agreements,
which target oil and gas blocks in the  Black Sea , after three
years or continue work and invest between $70 million and $180
million for another three years, government spokeswoman Ioana
Muntean said late yesterday in an e-mailed statement, without
naming the companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
