Sierra Leoneâ€™s budget deficit was
34.2 billion leones ($7.7 million) in July, compared with a
surplus of 7.4 billion leones a month earlier, according to the
Bank of Sierra Leone.  Domestic revenue collection declined 31 percent to 77.3
billion leones as the West African nation earned less from tax
collection, the Freetown-based central bank said on its website
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
