The biggest rally for Chinese stocks
yesterday in a year was a “key reversal,” with equities
overcoming “bad news” such as U.S. legislation on the yuan and
property curbs, according to China International Capital Corp.  “Simultaneous capitulation” in both onshore and offshore
Chinese markets is a positive signal that wasn’t even seen in
March 2008, Hao Hong, a Beijing-based global equity strategist
at CICC, said in a report to clients. “Our adjusted view is
that the sufficient and necessary conditions for a counter-trend
rally are in place, namely, capitulation and cheap valuation,”
he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
