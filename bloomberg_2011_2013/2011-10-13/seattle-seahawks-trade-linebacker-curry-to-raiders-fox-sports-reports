The  Seattle Seahawks  agreed to trade
linebacker Aaron Curry, the fourth overall pick of the 2009
National Football League draft, to the  Oakland Raiders  for two
draft picks, Fox Sports said, citing a teammate.  Curry, who has been struggling with pass coverage, was
benched in Week 3 this year in favor of rookie K.J. Wright, Fox
Sports said. He was replaced in the fourth quarter of last
week’s 35-26 win against the  New York Giants  by David Vobora.  Curry, 25, who played for Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told teammates yesterday that he
was leaving, linebacker Leroy Hill told Fox Sports.  “It’s a new beginning for him and hopefully he steps to
the plate,” Hill told Fox Sports. “I think down there he won’t
have all those high expectations that he had here so he can
relax and just play ball.”  Neither team made an official announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
