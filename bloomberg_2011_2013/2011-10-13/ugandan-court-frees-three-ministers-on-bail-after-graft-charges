A Ugandan magistrate granted bail to
three government ministers after charging them with corruption
related to a hotel-expansion project that cost the government 14
billion shillings ($4.9 million).  Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa, John Nasasira, the
governmentâ€™s chief whip, and Mwesigwa Rakutana, minister of
state for labor, denied the charges when they appeared before
magistrate Irene Akankwasa in the anti-corruption division of
the  High Court  in Kampala, the capital, today. All three posted
bail of 40 million shillings each, the magistrate said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
