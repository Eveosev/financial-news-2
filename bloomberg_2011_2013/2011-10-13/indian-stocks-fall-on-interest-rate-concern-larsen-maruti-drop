Indian stocks declined the most in a
week as the central bank signaled it will continue with a tight
monetary policy to tame inflation.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s largest engineering
company, lost 1.7 percent.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the top
carmaker, plunged to its lowest level since July 2009.  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land
Rover, slid for the first time in six days.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost 74.47, or
0.4 percent, to 16,883.92 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. The
gauge reached a three-week high yesterday after Infosys Ltd.,
the nation’s second-biggest software maker, reported net income
that beat forecast, improving the outlook for company earnings.  “We need domestic triggers for people to come and buy,
whether it is inflation coming down, the central bank ending its
tight monetary policy, the government pushing the envelope on
reforms or oil coming down,” Suresh A Mahadevan, head of
research at UBS AG, said in an interview to Bloomberg UTV.  India’s food inflation rate exceeded 9 percent for a third
week, sustaining pressure on the central bank to maintain its
tight monetary policy stance. Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said the inflation rate is above the  Reserve Bank  of
India’s “comfort level.”  India’s wholesale-price inflation rate was probably 9.75
percent in September, holding near a 13-month high, the median
of 20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed. The data is
scheduled for release tomorrow.  Inflation must ease before the central bank can cut rates,
Subbarao said yesterday, signaling policy makers may maintain a
tight monetary stance. The central bank raised borrowing costs
for a 12th time since March 2010 on Sept. 16 and meets for its
next policy review on Oct. 25.  Support Growth  “We are deeply sensitive in making India a low interest-
rate regime but that will take time,” Subbarao said. “First,
we need to bring down inflation to bring rates down.”  Emerging-market nations from  Brazil  to  South Korea  have
turned from fighting price gains to supporting expansion as a
struggling U.S. recovery and debt crisis in  Europe  threaten the
global economy.  The Sensex has lost 18 percent this year on concern rate
increases may compound the effects of the European crisis and
slowing U.S. economic growth on corporate profits. Companies in
the gauge trade at 14.4 times estimated profits, down from 21.5
times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is valued
at 9.8 times.  “What may not be priced in is that if we have an external
event in Europe and that results in a totally risk-off scenario
and we see foreign funds’ outflows of a few billion dollars,
then markets can correct further,” UBS’s Mahadevan said.  Auto Stocks  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. lost 0.4 percent to 5,077.85. Its October futures
settled at 5,068.90. The BSE-200 Index slid 0.4 percent.  Larsen dropped 1.7 percent to 1,419.1 rupees, extending
this year’s decline to 28 percent. Maruti plunged 2.5 percent to
1,058.25 rupees and its October futures settled at 1,057 rupees.
Tata Motors shed 2.7 percent to 175.85 rupees, halting a five-
day 23 percent rally.  Aluminum maker  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  slid 2.8 percent to
128.95 rupees. It’s 48 percent plunge this year makes it’s the
worst performer on the Sensex. Jindal Steel & Power Ltd.
declined 3.4 percent to 499.25 rupees.  Overseas investors bought a net 1.83 billion rupees of
Indian stocks on Oct. 11, paring their outflow this year to 23.6
billion rupees, according to data on the  website  of the
 Securities and Exchange Board of India . They withdrew a net $2.4
billion in August, the most since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
