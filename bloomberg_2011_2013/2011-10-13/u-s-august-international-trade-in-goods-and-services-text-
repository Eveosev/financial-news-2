The following is the text of
the U.S. trade balance report for Aug. released by the
Commerce Department.  Goods and Services  The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic
Analysis, through the  Department of Commerce , announced
today that total August exports of $177.6 billion and
imports of $223.2 billion resulted in a goods and services
deficit of $45.6 billion, virtually unchanged from July,
revised.  August exports were $0.1 billion less than July
exports of $177.7 billion.  August imports were $0.1
billion less than July imports of $223.3 billion.  In August, the goods deficit increased $0.1 billion from
July to $61.4 billion, and the services surplus increased
$0.2 billion to $15.8 billion.  Exports of goods decreased
$0.1 billion to $126.7 billion, and imports of goods were
virtually unchanged at $188.1 billion.  Exports of
services were virtually unchanged at $50.9 billion, and
imports of services decreased $0.2 billion to $35.1
billion.  The goods and services deficit increased $0.1 billion from
August 2010 to August 2011.  Exports were up $22.7
billion, or 14.7 percent, and imports were up $22.8
billion, or 11.4 percent.  Goods (Census Basis)  Exports of goods from July to August were virtually
unchanged. Increases occurred in industrial supplies and
materials ($0.8 billion);  consumer goods  ($0.2 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($0.2 billion); and other
goods ($0.1 billion). Decreases occurred in automotive
vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.0 billion) and capital
goods ($0.4 billion).  The July to August increase in imports of goods reflected
increases in industrial supplies and materials ($0.9
billion); other goods ($0.9 billion); and foods, feeds,
and beverages ($0.1 billion). Decreases occurred in
consumer goods ($0.8 billion); automotive vehicles, parts,
and engines ($0.7 billion); and capital goods ($0.3
billion).  The August 2010 to August 2011 increase in exports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($9.7 billion); capital goods ($4.2 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.6 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.3 billion); consumer goods
($0.9 billion); and other goods ($0.2 billion).  The August 2010 to August 2011 increase in imports of
goods reflected increases in industrial supplies and
materials ($13.4 billion); capital goods ($4.3 billion);
automotive vehicles, parts, and engines ($1.8 billion);
foods, feeds, and beverages ($1.1 billion); other goods
($0.5 billion); and consumer goods ($0.3 billion).  Services  Exports of services were virtually unchanged from July to
August. An increase in other private services (which
includes items such as business, professional, and
technical services, insurance services, and financial
services) was offset by a decrease in travel.  Changes in
the other categories of services exports were small and
offsetting.  Imports of services decreased $0.2 billion from July
to August. The decrease was more than accounted for by
decreases in travel, other transportation (which includes
freight and port services), and passenger fares. An
increase in other private services was partly offsetting.
Changes in the other categories of services imports were
small.  The August 2010 to August 2011 increase in exports
of services was $4.5 billion. The largest increases were
in other private services ($2.0 billion), travel ($1.0
billion), and royalties and license fees ($0.7 billion).
Within other private services, the largest increase was in
business, professional, and technical services.  The August 2010 to August 2011 increase in imports
of services was $0.8 billion. The largest increases were
in royalties and license fees ($0.3 billion), passenger
fares ($0.3 billion), and travel ($0.3 billion).  Goods and Services Moving Average  For the three months ending in August, exports of goods
and services averaged $175.7 billion, while imports of
goods and services averaged $223.3 billion, resulting in
an average trade deficit of $47.6 billion.  For the three
months ending in July, the average trade deficit was $49.1
billion, reflecting average exports of $175.1 billion and
average imports of $224.2 billion.  Selected Not Seasonally Adjusted Goods Details  The August figures show surpluses, in billions of dollars,
with Hong Kong $2.4 ($2.3 for July), Australia $1.4
($1.7), Singapore $1.0 ($1.2), and Egypt $0.4 ($0.4).
Deficits were recorded, in billions of dollars, with China
