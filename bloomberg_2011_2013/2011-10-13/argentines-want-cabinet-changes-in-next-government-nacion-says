Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner should change her Cabinet in December if
she wins the Oct. 23 election, according to a poll published in
the newspaper  La Nacion .  About 80 percent of the 1,400 people surveyed by Buenos
Aires-based pollster  Poliarquia Consultores  said that when
Fernandez takes office for a second four-year term she should
change some of her ministers, according to the paper.  About 14 percent of those surveyed said that the main issue
that Fernandez shouldnâ€™t change in a second term is her economic
policies, the poll showed. She should boost her policies to
fight crime, said 31 percent of those surveyed, while another 8
percent said she should increase job creation and 7 percent said
she should reduce domestic aid programs, La Nacion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
