The euro may decline to $1.20 within
three months as its runs into resistance levels following its
rally over the past week, according to Commerzbank AG, citing
trading patterns.  The shared currency, which has strengthened 2.2 percent
since Oct. 6, will see gains capped as it reaches its 200-day
moving average and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of its
decline from an August high, said  Axel Rudolph , a London-based
technical strategist at the German bank. After hitting
resistance, the euro will fall to its January 2011 low of
$1.2860 before dropping toward $1.20, he said.  “As long as the 200-day moving average at $1.4064 caps,
our overall bearish bias will remain intact,” Rudolph wrote in
a note to clients. “The first sign of a reversal lower taking
place will be a drop through Wednesday’s low at 1.3582.”  The euro depreciated 0.4 percent to $1.3737 at 4:41 p.m. in
 London . It fell to this year’s low of $1.3146 on Oct. 4.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Resistance refers to an area where selling orders may be
clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
