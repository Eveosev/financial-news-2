Brazil ’s economy contracted more
than expected in August, cementing expectations that policy
makers will continue to cut interest rates.  Economic activity, a proxy for gross domestic product, fell
0.53 percent in August from the previous month, according to the
central bank’s seasonally adjusted index, after expanding a
revised 0.34 percent in July. The decline was steeper than the
median forecast of a 0.4 percent slide from 13 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Activity was up 2.93 percent from the same month a year
ago, according to the non-seasonally adjusted series.  Traders are betting the central bank will cut its benchmark
interest rate half a point to 11.5 percent at its Oct. 18-19
policy meeting, according to Bloomberg estimates based on
interest rate futures yields. Central bank President Alexandre Tombini said last week “moderate” cuts in  interest rates  will
help shield the economy from the European debt crisis and won’t
compromise the country’s inflation target.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 10.45 percent at 11:38 a.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 1.4 percent to 1.7507 per
dollar.  Lower Forecast  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters in Paris
today that Brazil’s economy will grow 3.5 percent to 4 percent
this year, and could expand 5 percent in 2012. In 2010, Brazil
grew 7.5 percent, its fastest expansion in more than two
decades.  Consumer prices rose 7.31 percent in the year through
September, exceeding the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central
bank’s target range for a sixth straight month. The bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Retail sales in August fell the most since March 2010.
Industrial output contracted in August for the third time in
five months, while business confidence in the third quarter fell
to its lowest level in more than two years.  Brazil will grow more slowly than  China ,  India  and  Russia 
this year and in 2012, the International Monetary Fund
forecasts.  Tombini cut the benchmark interest rate a half point to 12
percent on Aug. 31, after raising it at the previous five policy
meetings, citing a “substantial deterioration” in the global
economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
