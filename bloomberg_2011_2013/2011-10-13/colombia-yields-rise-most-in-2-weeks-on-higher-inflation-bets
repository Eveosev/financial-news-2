Colombia’s peso fell for the first
day in three as declines in global equities eroded demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso slipped 0.3 percent to 1,901.03 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,896 yesterday. It has dropped 4.6 percent in the past
month, the worst performance after the Chilean peso among the
six most traded currencies in  Latin America .  European stocks fell from a two-month high as the  European
Central Bank  warned imposing further losses on holders of Greek
debt posed a risk to the euro area’s financial stability. U.S.
stocks also fell today, paring gains from the best Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rally over seven days since 2009.  “Uncertainty surrounding the global environment, including
growth, continues to hurt demand for risk,” said Daniel Lozano,
an analyst at brokerage Serfinco SA in Bogota.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.46 percent. The bond’s price rose 0.088 centavo to 120.408
centavos per peso.  The yield earlier rose to as high as 7.54 percent after
analysts increased their year-end inflation expectations.  Economists covering the Colombian economy raised their
year-end inflation forecast to 3.42 percent this month from 3.23
percent in the September survey, according to the median
forecast in a  central bank survey  of 38 economists published
yesterday. The results follow an Oct. 5 government report that
showed annual inflation quickened to 3.73 percent last month,
higher than the 3.43 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  ‘Temporary Shock’  “There’s some concern rains in  Colombia  will push food
prices higher,” said Lozano. “We see that as a temporary
shock.”  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.31 percent in September
from the previous month, driven by higher housing and food
costs, after declining 0.03 percent in August, according to the
government report. Policy makers have said inflation will end
this year around 3 percent, the mid-point of the central bank’s
2 percent to 4 percent target for this year.  Most of the analysts expect Colombia’s benchmark lending
rate to remain unchanged at 4.5 percent through year end,
according to the central bank survey. A month ago the majority
of economists surveyed expected the key rate to end at 4.75
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
