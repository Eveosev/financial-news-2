Latvia’s Reform Party, which won the
second-most seats in the country’s parliamentary elections,
called for a pause in creating a new government after coalition
partners questioned policies they agreed to earlier in the week.  The Unity Party and the  National Alliance  “are ready to
sign an agreement for the implementation of the Reform Party’s
agenda without a genuine intention to implement it,” according
to a statement released late yesterday.  The three parties agreed to form a coalition holding 56
seats in the 100-member parliament with Valdis Dombrovskis
returning as premier on Oct. 11. Zatlers was unable to form a
three-party government with Harmony Center, which won the most
seats in Sept. 17 elections and appeals to the country’s Russian
minority, after Unity refused to join.  President Andris Berzins said he won’t nominate a new prime
minister before parliament’s term ends on Oct. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
