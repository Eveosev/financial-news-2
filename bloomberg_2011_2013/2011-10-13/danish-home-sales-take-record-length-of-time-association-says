Danish homes up for sale in
September had been on the market an average of nine months, the
longest stretch since 2004 when the Association of Danish
Mortgage Banks began collecting the data, the group said.  The increase in the time it takes to make a sale rose even
as prices and the number of available properties fell from a
month earlier, the Copenhagen-based association said today on
its website. Prices dropped 0.4 percent from August, while the
number of homes for sale fell 1.1 percent to 46,849, it said.  “The month’s fall in the number of properties for sale
isn’t, unfortunately, a sign that the housing market is
improving,” Ane Arnth Jensen, the association’s director, said
in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
