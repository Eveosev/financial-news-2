Proposals by President  Barack Obama 
and three U.S. senators to create a national infrastructure bank
aren’t “going anywhere” after the House transportation
committee’s chairman called the proposal “dead on arrival,”
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said.  Representative John Mica’s remarks yesterday show House
Republicans won’t support the measure, LaHood said today at the
 National Press Club  in Washington.  LaHood said he supports creating a new Build American Bond
program, to succeed one that ended Dec. 31, because it helps
municipalities finance infrastructure projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
