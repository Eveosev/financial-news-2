Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8) ,
Germany’s biggest cable operator, favors  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) ’s
planned takeover of Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH on the ground
that it would strengthen infrastructure competition,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing  Adrian von Hammerstein,  Kabel
Deutschland ’s chief executive officer.  The bid is currently under review by German regulators.  Kabel Deutschland will reach its target of reducing debt to
between three and 3.5 times earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization by the end of its fiscal year on
March 31, von Hammerstein was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
