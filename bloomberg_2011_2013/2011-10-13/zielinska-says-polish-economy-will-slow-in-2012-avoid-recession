Poland’s economy and manufacturing
remain relatively strong and there are no grounds to predict a
recession next year, even if contraction does occur in some
industries, Anna Zielinska-Glebocka of the central bank’s
Monetary Policy Council said today in an interview on TVN CNBC.  Zielinska said economic growth will slow and probably hit
bottom in the second quarter of 2012 before rebounding in the
second half of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
