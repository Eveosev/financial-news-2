The top Democrat on the U.S. House
Armed Services Committee warned Congress’  deficit-reduction 
supercommittee today against further cuts to the Pentagon’s
budget.  Representative  Adam Smith  of Washington state sent his
recommendations to the supercommittee and pressed the 12-member
panel to “avoid cuts to national defense accounts” beyond the
roughly $450 billion in budget reductions already projected over
the next decade.  The panel must avoid “any deficit reduction
recommendations that might prematurely force the DOD to make
what may prove to be precarious strategic adjustments,” Smith
wrote, referring to the  Department of Defense .  Smith said the supercommittee must instead consider
increasing federal revenue.  “Including revenues in an overall balanced approach to
deficit reduction is the best course of action for the
committee,” he said.  Smith’s position on avoiding further defense cuts is
similar to that of Howard P. “Buck” McKeon, the California
Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. While McKeon said he opposed increases in revenue,
such as taxes, he said he would support boosting revenue if
there were no other way to prevent cuts in defense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
