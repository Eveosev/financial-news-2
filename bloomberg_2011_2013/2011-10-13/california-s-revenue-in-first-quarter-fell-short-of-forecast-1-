California ’s tax collections in the
first quarter of the fiscal year fell short of projections by
$654 million, or about 3.4 percent, the state Finance Department
 reported .  The estimate today is in line with figures released by
state Controller John Chiang on Oct. 10. The Democratic
controller said California was $705 million, or 3.6 percent,
short of budget targets for the year that began July 1.  If the most-populous state is likely to fall $1 billion or
more behind revenue forecasts for the year, California will cut
funding for universities, social services and other programs
under a series of automatic triggers written into the budget. A
$2 billion shortfall would result in cuts to public education
that could shorten the school year by seven days and end
subsidies for busing.  “In November and December, the Legislative Analyst’s
Office and Finance will produce new forecasts of revenue for the
2011-12 fiscal year based on the economic and cash data
available at those times,” according to the report. “It is
these forecasts that will determine whether the ‘trigger’ budget
reductions will be implemented.”  Chiang said the numbers “do not paint a hopeful picture”
in anticipating whether the automatic cuts can be avoided.  Today’s figures differ from Chiang’s because some money
received by the state is counted sooner by the agency than by
the controller, said H.D. Palmer, a Finance Department
spokesman, in an e-mail message.  “Each month, there may be such timing differences,”
Palmer said. “Over time, both reports are the same.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
