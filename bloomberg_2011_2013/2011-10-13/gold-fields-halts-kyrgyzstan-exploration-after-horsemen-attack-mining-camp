Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  halted plans to
resume drilling at its Talas copper and gold exploration
project in Kyrgyzstan after horsemen attacked the mining camp
and leaders at a nearby village were threatened with death if
they cooperate with the company.  The mining camp near Aral village was attacked by horsemen
armed with petrol bombs and sticks just after midnight on Oct.
8, the company said in a statement dated Oct. 10 and e-mailed
today. Drilling, due to resume in November, won’t go ahead until
the security of villagers has been guaranteed, said David Grant,
the head of the operation.  “Drilling is suspended until the authorities are able to
bring those organizing the conflict to justice,” he said today
in an e-mailed reply to questions. “We are not prepared to put
people’s lives at risk in Aral.”  Gold Fields, based in Johannesburg, is seeking to boost
the share of production it gets from operations outside South 
Africa. The company also operates mines in  Peru ,  Ghana  and 
 Australia .  Several buildings were set on fire during the attack and
the camp’s security manager was “severely beaten” as he ran
from a burning building, Gold Fields said.  “The majority of the local population are supportive of
Talas Copper Gold activity,” Grant said. “The opposition is
organized by a very small group who appear to have outside
support and are prepared to use any means to achieve their
objectives.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
