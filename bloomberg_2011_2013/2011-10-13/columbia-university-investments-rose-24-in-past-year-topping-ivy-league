Columbia University ’s investments
returned 24 percent in the past fiscal year, placing the school
ahead of Harvard and Yale with the top-performing endowment in
the Ivy League.  The endowment was valued at $7.8 billion as of June 30, the
New York school said today in a statement.  Endowments at the richest U.S. universities have risen for
two consecutive years, following record losses in the aftermath
of the September 2008  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  bankruptcy.
Investments at the $19.4 billion fund at  Yale University  in New
Haven, Connecticut, gained 22 percent.  Harvard University , the
world’s richest school with a $32 billion fund, increased 21
percent.  In the 10 years ending June 30, Columbia’s investments
generated an average annual gain of 9.9 percent, compared with
the 10.1 percent increase of Yale, the best-performing  Ivy
League  institution. Harvard, in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
averaged a 9.4 percent gain over the period.  All of the Ivy League schools except Brown University in
Providence, Rhode Island, have reported yearly results. The
group consists of eight selective private schools in the
northeastern U.S.  Dartmouth Trails  Princeton University on Oct. 7 said investments at the New
Jersey-based school’s $17.1 billion endowment returned 22
percent in the past fiscal year, while the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia said Sept. 15 its $6.58 billion
fund gained 19 percent, helped by rising stock markets. Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York, said Sept. 28 that its $5.35
billion fund climbed 20 percent.  Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, is the worst
performer so far in the Ivy League. The university said Sept. 28
that investments rose 18 percent for the year ended June 30,
boosted by stocks and venture capital and gains across asset
classes. Investment returns helped increase the endowment to
$3.41 billion, after more than $40 million in new gifts and
transfers, partly offset by distributions, Dartmouth said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
