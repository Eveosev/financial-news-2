The Czech current-account deficit
widened in August to 33.65 billion koruna ($1.88 billion), the
widest monthly shortfall this year, as foreign-owned companies
sent money home in the form of dividends.  The deficit for August included 39 billion koruna in
dividend payments, the central bank in  Prague   said  today on its
website. The current-account result exceeded a median forecast
for a shortfall of 16 billion koruna by nine analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  The Czech units of companies such as  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA,
Erste Bank AG,  Philip Morris International Inc. (PM)  and Volkswagen
AG often transfer much of the dividend payments to their offices
outside of the country during the middle of each year.  The balance of current transfers in August included a
surplus of 2.7 billion koruna from transfers to the European
Union budget, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
