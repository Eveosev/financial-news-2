Natixis (KN)  SA, BPCE SA’s investment
banking unit, and three employees were fined a total of 355,000
euros ($487,300) by  France ’s financial markets regulator for
violations at the now-shuttered Natixis Securities brokerage
unit.  Natixis was fined 250,000 euros and the employees were each
fined 35,000 euros, the Autorite des Marches Financiers said
today in a  decision  posted on its website.  The fine concerns “isolated and old” actions, said
Victoria Eideliman, a spokeswoman for Natixis. “We are studying
the decision and reserve the right to appeal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
