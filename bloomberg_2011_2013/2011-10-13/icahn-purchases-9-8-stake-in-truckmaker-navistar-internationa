Navistar International Corp. (NAV) , the
maker of International brand trucks, rose the most since May
2010 after billionaire  Carl Icahn  disclosed a 9.8 percent stake.  Navistar gained 7.3 percent to $41.51 at the close in  New
York , the most since May 10, 2010. The shares have dropped 28
percent this year.  Icahn’s purchase of 7.11 million Navistar shares or options
to buy shares makes him the second-biggest holder of the
Warrenville, Illinois-based truckmaker. Icahn, who buys
positions in companies he considers to be under-performing and
then pushes for change, has held talks with the management about
adding people to its board, according to a filing late
yesterday.  Navistar last month reported profit in the third quarter of
$61 million, or 79 cents a share, excluding a tax allowance, as
lower-priced fleet sales accounted for a larger share of the
business. Profit was down from $107 million, or $1.44 a share, a
year earlier, excluding some items.  Icahn didn’t return a telephone message seeking comment
today.  Navistar “is always open to dialogue with its investors
that can enhance  shareholder value ,” Karen Denning, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Icahn’s stake is second only to Wellington Management Co.,
which owned 7.29 million shares as of Aug. 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Icahn made millions in the 1980s pressuring companies from
USX Corp. to Texaco Inc. to split up or increase dividends and
stock buybacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
