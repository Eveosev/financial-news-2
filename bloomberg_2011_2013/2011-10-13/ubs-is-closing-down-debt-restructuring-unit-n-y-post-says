UBS AG (UBSN)  is closing its profitable
debt restructuring unit, integrating it into a unit that offers
high-interest loans, the New York Post reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  A spokeswoman told the newspaper the Swiss bank isn’t
“exiting the restructuring business.”  However, the Post said UBS has been telling clients that
the business will be “de-emphasized,” according to its
informants.  The unit has added as much as $80 million to UBS’s profit
at little cost, the newspaper cited a person familiar with its
workings as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
