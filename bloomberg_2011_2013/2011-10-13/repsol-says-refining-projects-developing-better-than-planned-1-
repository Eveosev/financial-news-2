Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s largest oil
company, said upgrades to its refineries in Cartagena and Bilbao
are developing “better than planned.”  The company expects 200 million euros ($275 million) of
savings compared with its budget, according to a presentation to
be given to analysts today and filed earlier to regulators.  The investments, part of a 5.3 billion-euro project to
modernize its downstream facilities, were planned to double
refining margins in Spain, Repsol Downstream Operations Director
Pedro Fernandez Frial said in July.  Repsol is aiming to turn its Spanish plants into cash cows
that will finance the hunt for more oil and gas reserves. The
upgrades will enable the plants to produce more diesel from
cheaper blends of crude.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
