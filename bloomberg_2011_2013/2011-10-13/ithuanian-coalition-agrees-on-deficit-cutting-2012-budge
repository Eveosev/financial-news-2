The Lithuanian coalition agreed on a
2012 budget plan draft that will cut the deficit to 2.8 percent
of gross domestic product by raising revenue from profits of
state-owned companies and cutting spending on investment
projects.  The government will approve the bill in a meeting tomorrow,
Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius told journalists in Vilnius
today. The deficit compares with an expected shortfall of 5.3
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
