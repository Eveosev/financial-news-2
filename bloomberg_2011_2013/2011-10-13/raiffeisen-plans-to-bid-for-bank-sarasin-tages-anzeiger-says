The Swiss Raiffeisen group plans to
bid for  Bank Sarasin & Cie AG (BSAN) ,  Tages-Anzeiger  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Rabobank, which has a controlling stake in Basel-based
Sarasin, appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co. at the start of the year
to sell the stake, the newspaper said.  Yesterday, it was reported that  Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER)  has
made a non-binding bid for Sarasin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
