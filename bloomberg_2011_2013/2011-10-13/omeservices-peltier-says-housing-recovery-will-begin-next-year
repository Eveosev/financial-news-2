A U.S. housing recovery will begin
by late 2012, building on a “pent-up demand” for
homeownership, according to Ron Peltier, chief executive officer
of HomeServices of America Inc.  The housing market is being held back by high unemployment
and tough underwriting standards, he said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  “We tend to think that the cycle is close to its end,”
Peltier said. “We will be bouncing along the bottom and I think
by mid- to late- 2012, we will begin to see a recovery.”  HomeServices, based in  Minneapolis , is a unit of Warren
Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   To contact the reporter on this story:
