Cyprus’s economy will expand by
about 0.2 percent in 2012, less than a previous forecast for as
much as 1.5 percent growth, according to the budget submitted to
Parliament today.  The eastern Mediterranean island’s budget deficit will be
2.8 percent of gross domestic product, more than a previous
forecast of 2.3 percent, after a shortfall of about 6.5 percent
this year, according to a draft of the 2012 budget e-mailed by
the Nicosia-based  Finance Ministry .  Public debt will reach almost 67 percent of GDP next year,
up from a previous estimate of 65 percent, the document showed.
The budget confirmed an earlier forecast for 0.5 percent growth
in 2011.  The Cypriot economy will show little or no growth this year
and contract slightly in 2012, the  International Monetary Fund 
said yesterday in an annual review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
