Brazilian soy farmers almost doubled
the amount of Amazon land they deforested in the previous season
as they sought to profit from higher prices for the grain,
according to the soybean processors’ association.  Farmers sowed 11,689 hectares of soy in the world’s biggest
rain forest from July 2006 to July 2011, up from 6,295 hectares
a year earlier, the association, known as Abiove, said today in
a statement distributed from Brasilia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
