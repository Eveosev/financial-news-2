Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services’
share of the Arab country’s mobile-phone market dropped to 39
percent in July from 44 percent a year earlier as market leader
Vodafone  Egypt  maintained its lead.  Egypt’s oldest mobile network operator, also known as
Mobinil, lost 101,208 users in July from the previous month to
30.26 million,  according to data  posted on the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology  website . Competitors
 Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s Egyptian unit and Etisalat Misr both added
subscribers to hold 45 percent and 16 percent of the market
respectively, the data show.  The Arab country’s telecommunications market regulator may
offer a so-called mobile virtual network operator license by the
end of the year, allowing companies that want to offer mobile
phone services to use the networks of existing operators, Al Mal
newspaper reported in May.  Mobinil, the only publicly traded company out of Egypt’s
three operators, gained 4.3 percent to 96 Egyptian pounds at
12.35 p.m. in Cairo. That valued the company at 9.6 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion).  Telecom Egypt (ETEL) , the country’s fixed-line
phone monopoly, owns 45 percent of Vodafone Egypt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
