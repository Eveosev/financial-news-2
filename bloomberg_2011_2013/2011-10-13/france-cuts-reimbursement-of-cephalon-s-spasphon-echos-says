The French social security system
will cut reimbursement of  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) ’s Spasphon drug by half
to 15 percent as of Nov. 1, Les Echos reported, citing an
official announcement.  The drug, prescribed about 6 million times a year in
 France , had escaped such a reduction in a previous round of
efforts to reduce the country’s healthcare costs, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
