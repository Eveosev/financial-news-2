Coal & Allied Industries Ltd. (CNA) , the
Australian coal unit of Rio Tinto Group that’s being taken
private, said third-quarter sales rose 14 percent as output at
its operations in New South  Wales  increased.  Coal & Allied’s share of production at the company’s four
mines in New South Wales reached 5.6 million metric tons in the
three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 4.9 million a year
earlier, the Brisbane-based company said in a statement today.  Total coal sales from the four operations in New South
Wales gained 12 percent from a year earlier to 7.4 million tons
as output rose and the area benefited from the absence of an
annual coal wash plant closure that took place last year,
according to the statement.  A maintenance shutdown is scheduled for the current quarter,
Coal & Allied said.  Coal & Allied fell 0.4 percent to A$123.39 at 3:05 p.m. in
Sydney trading, compared with a 0.6 percent gain in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  The coal producer accepted a bid totaling A$1.53 billion
($1.56 billion) from its two biggest shareholders Rio Tinto and
Mitsubishi Corp. in August for shares they don’t already own.  To contact the reporter on this story:
