The ratio of Japanese adults who
smoke declined to 21.7 percent as of August this year due to the
aging of society and a tax increase in October 2010,  Japan
Tobacco Inc. (2914)  said.  That’s a 2.2 percentage point decline from the company’s
previous annual survey, Japan Tobacco said today in a faxed
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
