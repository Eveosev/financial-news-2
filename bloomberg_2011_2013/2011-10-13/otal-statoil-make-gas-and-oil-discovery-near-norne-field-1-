Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil
company, made a natural gas and oil find about eight kilometers
(5 miles) west of the Norne field in the Norwegian Sea.  The find is estimated at 3 million to 16 million cubic
meters of recoverable oil equivalents, Norway’s Petroleum
Directorate, based in Stavanger, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Total owns a 50 percent stake in the license and is the
operator.  Statoil ASA (STL)  holds the remainder, according to the
NPD’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
