The  European Central Bank  said the
involvement of the private sector in euro-area bailouts through
enforced investor losses is a risk to financial stability and
would have “direct negative effects” on the banking sector.  While private-sector involvement “is certain to place
significant stress on the solvency of banks and other private
financial institutions in the country concerned, it will also
have an impact on the balance sheets of banks in other euro-area
countries,” the Frankfurt-based central bank said in its
monthly bulletin today.  “The ECB has strongly advised against all concepts that
are not purely voluntary or that have elements of compulsion,
and has called for the avoidance of any credit events and
selective default or default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
