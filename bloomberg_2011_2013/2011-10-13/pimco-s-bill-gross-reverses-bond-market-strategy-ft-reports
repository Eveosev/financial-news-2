Bill Gross , who manages Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s $242 billion flagship bond fund, has
reversed his strategy, altering the fund’s composition by
betting on lower long-term  interest rates , the Financial Times
reported.  In February, Gross largely withdrew from U.S. bond markets,
taking the view that there would be a sharp rise in inflation,
the newspaper said.  His Total Return fund has yielded only 1.9 percent for
investors so far this year, meaning he trails the Barclays U.S.
aggregate bond index and may now be trying to beat this
benchmark by means of a heavier weighting of long-term debt, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
