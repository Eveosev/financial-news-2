Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said talks
are under way with the  Institute of International Finance  on the
cost to investors of a second bailout package for  Greece .  Asked if bondholders might face a loss of more than 21
percent, Juncker said: “One can’t say that at the moment. We’re
in the process of having discussions at all levels, also with
the IIF. One has to wait until the European Council and a
special meeting of the euro group before we can comment on
that.”  Juncker said in an interview in Luxembourg today that the
date of the euro-area finance ministers’ meeting isn’t set.
European Union leaders are scheduled to meet on Oct. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
