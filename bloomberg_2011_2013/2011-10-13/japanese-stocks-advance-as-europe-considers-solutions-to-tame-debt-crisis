Japanese stocks rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average climbing to its highest close in almost
a month, as increased orders boosted machinery makers and chip
stocks gained after ASML Holding NV beat earnings estimates.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the world’s biggest maker of controls for
machine tools, climbed 3.4 percent.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the No. 1
maker of chip testers, surged 5.6 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 2.1
percent after the European Commission called for a “coordinated
approach” to recapitalize the region’s banks.  The Nikkei 225 rose 1 percent to 8,823.25, its highest
close since Sept. 16. The broader Topix added 0.7 percent to
758.83. Growing confidence that Europe will resolve its debt
crisis helped the gauge rebound 4.5 percent since Oct. 5, when
it dropped to a low for the year.  “At the very least, there’s less fear that  Europe ’s debt
problem is going to spill over into the financial system,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “Sentiment has improved.”  The Topix tumbled 16 percent this year amid concern the U.S.
would fall into a another recession while Europe teeters on the
edge of a crisis like the one that followed the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. The slide has cut the
price of shares on the index to 0.88 times estimated book value,
near the lowest since March 2009.  ‘Lehman Shock II’  “There was a lot of fear that we were going to have Lehman
Shock Part II but Europe is making progress toward dealing with
the crisis,” said Koji Toda, chief  fund manager  at Resona Bank
Ltd. in Tokyo. “For the moment, there’s a sense that an
immediate crisis has been averted.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index advanced 1 percent in  New York 
yesterday. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 1.7 percent to a
two-month high as Olli Rehn, the European Commission’s economic
and monetary affairs commissioner, said the debt crisis can be
resolved.  Japanese exporters advanced after minutes of a Sept. 20-21
Federal Reserve meeting released yesterday showed Fed officials
aren’t ruling out further asset purchases as a way to boost the
world’s biggest economy.  Mazda Motor Corp., which depends on  North America  for about
27 percent of sales, climbed 4.5 percent to 163 yen. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, added 0.7 percent to
2,600 yen. Nintendo Co., the maker of Wii game consoles, climbed
3.5 percent to 12,010 yen.  Machinery Makers  Makers of factory equipment increased after a report showed
machine tool orders climbed 20 percent in September from a year
earlier. On a month-to-month basis, bookings gained for the
first time since June.  Fanuc rose 3.4 percent to 11,970 yen. Tsudakoma Corp., a
manufacturer of machines used to make textiles, jumped 6 percent
to 160 yen. Tsugami Corp., a supplier of precision lathes,
surged 9.9 percent to 378 yen.  Semiconductor-related stocks rallied after ASML Holding,
Europe’s biggest chip-equipment maker, reported third-quarter
net income that surpassed analyst estimates and said fourth-
quarter orders will increase.  Advantest climbed 5.6 percent to 889 yen.  Tokyo  Electron
Ltd., Japan’s biggest manufacturer of chip-making gear, rose 1.4
percent to 4,020 yen. Elpida Memory Inc., the world’s third-
largest maker of computer memory chips, advanced 4 percent to
552 yen. Sumco Corp., a wafer producer, gained 1.9 percent to
804 yen.  “ASML is forecasting an orders recovery,” said Yumi Nishimura, an analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. “That
suggests that the earnings environment in semiconductors will
improve.”  ‘Coordinated Approach’  Financial advanced after European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  called for the payout of a sixth loan to  Greece  and a
faster start for a permanent rescue fund to address the region’s
debt woes. He also pushed for a “coordinated approach” to
deliver a “significantly higher capital ratio of highest
quality capital” for banks, while offering government funds
only as a last resort.  Mitsubishi UFJ rose 2.1 percent to 340 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s second-biggest lender, gained 2.6
percent to 2,159 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
