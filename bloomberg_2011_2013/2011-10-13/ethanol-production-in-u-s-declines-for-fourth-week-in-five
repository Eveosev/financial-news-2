Ethanol production in the U.S. fell
0.3 percent to 860,000 barrels a day in the week ended Oct. 7,
according to an Energy Department report.  Output declined for the fourth time in five weeks to the
second-lowest level since the week ending April 15. Production
in the week ending Sept. 23 was lower at 841,000 barrels a day.
Stockpiles declined 2.7 percent to 16.9 million barrels from
17.3 million the previous week, the department said.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
slid 0.3 percent to 5.14 million barrels a day. Refiners receive
a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended into
the motor fuel.  Denatured Ethanol for November delivery fell 2.2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.605 a gallon at 11:31 a.m. New York time on
