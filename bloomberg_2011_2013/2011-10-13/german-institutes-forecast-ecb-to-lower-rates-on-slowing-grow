The  European Central Bank  will lower
its benchmark  interest rate  to 1 percent by the end of the year
and keep it there through 2012 as the economy cools,  Germany ’s
top economic institutes said in a joint forecast.  Inflation in the 17-member euro region will slow to 1.5
percent next year and inflation expectations have “clearly
weakened” in recent months, the institutes said in their twice-
yearly outlook in Berlin today. That’s giving the central bank
room to lower borrowing costs from 1.5 percent, they said.  The ECB last week resisted calls to lower rates, instead
opting to extend the use of unconventional tools by providing
banks with unlimited cash and purchasing covered bonds. The
central bank said in its monthly report today that while the
economy is facing “intensified downside risks,” inflation may
remain above its 2 percent ceiling for the rest of 2011.  The institutes said the Frankfurt-based central bank lost
credibility with its decision to purchase bonds of distressed
euro-region nations such as  Greece , and called on policy makers
to stop the program. Governments should help the bank by taking
over some of its crisis-fighting tools, they said.  Euro-region governments should “create a central
institution that can quickly support or, if needed, wind down
systemically important banks,” the institutes said. That would
allow the ECB to “focus entirely on stabilizing inflation and
managing liquidity in the banking sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
