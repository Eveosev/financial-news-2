Cool weather in the next two weeks
may be enough to make residents of the U.S. East and Midwest
turn up their thermostats, said  Matt Rogers , president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  In his 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day outlooks, Rogers
predicts temperatures will be lower than average in the Midwest
from Oct. 18 to Oct. 22 and in the Northeast from Oct. 23 to
Oct. 27.  “The intensity of the cooling is not severe, but it is
more than sufficient to boost year-on-year heating demand
increases for the second half of October in the Midwest and
East,” Rogers said today in a note to clients.  Heating oil for November delivery rose 0.73 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.942 a gallon at 9:15 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.9552, the highest
intraday level since Sept. 21.  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , also predicts the
Southwest and  Southern California  will be warmer than normal
from Oct. 18 to Oct. 27.  To contact the reporters on this story:
