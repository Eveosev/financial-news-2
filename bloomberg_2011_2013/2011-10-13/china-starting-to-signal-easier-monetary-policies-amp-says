China  has started to signal easier
monetary policies after the Wenzhou city situation raised
concerns about the negative effects on the economy from
tightening measures, according to Shane Oliver, Sydney-based
head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd.  “Wenzhou is consistent with the tightening measures,” he
said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Oliver predicts
“good gains” for China’s stocks over the next six to 12
months. He said equities are “getting close to the end of the
 bear market .”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
