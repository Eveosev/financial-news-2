Stocks fell, halting the biggest
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rally over seven days since 2009,
following a decline in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s profit and concern
that equities had surged too much on optimism about the European
debt crisis. Commodities slid and Treasuries rallied.  The S&P 500 slipped 0.3 percent at 4 p.m.  New York  time,
paring its retreat from 1.4 percent as technology stocks rose.
Gains in chipmakers and computer producers drove the Nasdaq
Composite Index up 0.6 percent. After markets closed, Google
Inc. jumped 5.1 percent and Nasdaq-100 Index futures rose 1.3
percent following the search engine’s higher-than-estimated
profit. Silver, nickel and copper lost more than 2.8 percent.
Ten- and 30-year Treasuries rose, snapping a six-day decline.  The S&P 500 retreated today after rebounding from last
week’s 13-month low, surging 9.8 percent over seven sessions as
growing confidence in Europe’s efforts to fight its debt crisis
and improving U.S. economic data alleviated concern about a
relapse into a recession. JPMorgan reported 33 percent less
profit, excluding a $1.9 billion accounting benefit, as
 investment banking  and trading income slumped.  “I don’t know that the road is completely clear,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $109 billion as chief investment
officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth Management, said in a
telephone interview. “We may be a little bit ahead of ourselves
from the rally we’ve seen as far as what that final package in
Europe looks like. It’s not going to be easy.”  Earnings Season  JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, slumped
4.8 percent to help drag down the  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,
which yesterday briefly erased its 2011 loss before paring its
gain. Bank of America Corp., which will release results on Oct.
18, sank 5.5 percent. Financial stocks in the  S&P 500  dropped
2.4 percent, the most among 10 industries, followed by
industrial companies with a 0.9 percent loss and raw-material
producers with a 0.5 percent slump.  Technology companies in the S&P 500 rose 1 percent as
Micron Corp. and Nvidia Corp. led a rally in chipmakers,
advancing more than 5.8 percent. Yahoo! Inc. gained 1 percent as
KKR & Co. and Blackstone Group LP were said to be among private-
equity firms considering possible bids for the  Internet company ,
according to people with knowledge of the matter.  Stocks fell even as applications for unemployment insurance
payments decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000,
Labor Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The  U.S. trade deficit  was little changed at $45.6
billion in August, compared with a median projection of $45.8
billion in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, according to
data from the Commerce Department in  Washington .  Trading Range  The S&P 500’s rebound over the previous seven sessions had
yet to bring the gauge out of a  price range  where it’s traded
for more than two months. The index has fluctuated between
1,074.77 and 1,230.71 since Aug. 5.  U.S. 10-year Treasuries rose for the first time in seven
days, pushing yields down four basis points to 2.17 percent.
Thirty-year yields fell five basis points to 3.14 percent.  Banks tumbled 3.7 percent as a group for the biggest
retreat among 19 industries in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, with
BNP Paribas losing 5.7 percent and Barclays Plc down 7.4
percent. At least 66 of Europe’s biggest banks would fail a
revised European Union stress test and need to raise about 220
billion euros ($302.3 billion) of capital, Credit Suisse Group
AG analysts said in a note today.  Carrefour, Libor  Carrefour SA (CA)  sank 5.9 percent as the world’s second-largest
retailer lowered its 2011 profit forecast for the second time in
three months. Anglo American Plc led a retreat in mining
companies, sliding 4.7 percent.  Rates at which the world’s banks say they can borrow from
each other in dollars are diverging by the most in more than two
years, a sign European leaders are still struggling to contain
the region’s debt crisis. The gap between the highest and lowest
reported fixings by 19 banks contributing to the three-month
London interbank offered rate reached 18.75 basis points today,
the widest since September 2009. Libor, the lending benchmark
for $360 trillion of financial instruments, climbed to 0.403
percent, the highest since August 2010.  The  European Central Bank  said the involvement of the
private sector in euro-area bailouts through forced investor
losses would have “direct negative effects” on banks.  Pressuring Markets  “Any disagreements on how we come out of this crisis will
generate pressure on markets and specifically on the financial
sector,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at Interbrokers in
 Barcelona ,  Spain . “We are coming from a solid rally in recent
days on the hopes that the debt crisis may be nearing a
resolution. Anything that may divert that process will generate
renewed instability.”  Italy’s FTSE MIB Index slumped 3.7 percent to lead losses
among  Europe ’s developed markets. Italian Prime Minister  Silvio
Berlusconi  called for a confidence vote in Parliament to prove
he has enough support to rule after failing to muster a majority
on a legislative ballot this week. Berlusconi’s allies indicated
the vote may be tomorrow.  Italian 10-year bond fell for a fifth day and the yield
rose eight basis points to 5.82 percent, the highest since
August, as the nation sold debt maturing in 2016 and 2015. The
yield climbed nine basis points to 5.81 percent. German bunds
advanced for the first time in seven days, driving the 10-year
yield down eight basis points to 2.11 percent.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments climbed 16 basis points to 336.
Increases signal worsening perceptions of  credit quality .  Euro, Yen  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3768 and lost 0.7 percent
to 105.83 yen. The Japanese currency rose 0.5 percent to 76.87
per dollar, strengthening versus 14 of 16 major counterparts.  Copper dropped 2.5 percent to $3.307 a pound, the biggest
decline this month, amid concern Europe’s debt woes will hamper
the economy in  China , the largest consumer of the metal. Oil in
New York fell 1.1 percent to $84.67 a barrel. Raw sugar jumped
3.5 percent to 26.91 cents a pound on speculation floods will
delay harvests across  Southeast Asia , including  Thailand , the
world’s second-biggest exporter.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 0.9 percent and is
up 12 percent in seven days, the biggest rally since May 2009.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
listed in  Hong Kong  rose 3.7 percent, extending a rebound from
its Oct. 4 low to 21 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index
gained 0.8 percent after China’s State Council said it will
provide financial support and preferential tax policies for
small companies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
