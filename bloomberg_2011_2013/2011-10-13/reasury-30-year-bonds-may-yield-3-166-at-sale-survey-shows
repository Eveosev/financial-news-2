The Treasury’s $13 billion sale of
30-year bonds may draw a record low yield of 3.166 percent,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
eight of the  Federal Reserve ’s 22 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in August 2041, yielded 3.150
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New York
time.  Last month’s $13 billion sale of 30-year bonds drew a
record low yield of 3.31 percent, compared with 3.75 percent at
the August auction. The Sept. 14 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio,
which gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.85, the highest level since March. It was 2.08 in
August and averaged 2.66 for the past 10 sales.    Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 39.4 percent of the bonds at the
September sale, the most since April, compared with the 37.9
percent average for the past 10 auctions.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.3 percent of
the securities at the last sale, compared with 19.5 percent in
August and compared with an average of 12.2 percent at the past
10 offerings.  Thirty-year bonds have gained 26 percent this year,
compared with a 7.4 percent return for Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s offering is the last of three note and bond sales
this week totaling $66 billion. The $32 billion auction of
three-year notes on Oct. 11 drew a yield of 0.544 percent, and
the $21 billion sale of 10-year debt yesterday yielded 2.271
percent.  The entire amount raised this week is new cash, with none
of the proceeds dedicated to redeeming maturing securities,
according to the Treasury Department.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
