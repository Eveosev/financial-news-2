Portugal ’s consumer price index rose
in September from a year earlier at a faster pace than recorded
in August.  Consumer prices, using a harmonized European Union measure,
climbed 3.5 percent from a year earlier, more than the 2.8
percent increase in August, the Lisbon-based National Statistics
Institute said today in an e-mailed statement. Prices rose 0.6
percent from August.  Using the statistics institute’s own methods, consumer
prices in Portugal rose 3.6 percent in September from a year
earlier and climbed 0.8 percent from August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
