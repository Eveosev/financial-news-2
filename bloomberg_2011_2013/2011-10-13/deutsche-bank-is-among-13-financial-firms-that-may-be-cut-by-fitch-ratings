Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  Germany ’s largest
lender, is among at least 13 financial firms that may have
credit or viability grades cut by Fitch Ratings.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Credit Suisse
AG were also among firms that may be cut based on “Fitch’s view
that these institutions’ business models are particularly
sensitive to the increased challenges the financial markets are
facing,” the ratings firm said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
