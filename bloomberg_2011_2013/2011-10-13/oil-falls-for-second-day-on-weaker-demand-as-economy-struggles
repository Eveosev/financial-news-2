Oil dropped for a second day in  New
York  as U.S. equities declined on a decrease in JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s earnings and crude supplies increased more than forecast.
Brent oil’s premium to New York futures reached a record.  Futures retreated 1.6 percent as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index halted its biggest gain over seven days since 2009. Oil
stockpiles rose 0.4 percent and gasoline inventories
unexpectedly tumbled as the refinery utilization rate fell the
most in a single week since February.  “The crude market is really tracking the  S&P 500  and the
dollar right now, and I don’t think it’s trading independently
of anything,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam Mesh
Trading Group in New York. “The crude number was a bearish one
today.”  Crude for November delivery declined $1.34 to settle at
$84.23 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
down 7.8 percent this year.  Brent for November settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped 25 cents, or 0.2 percent to
$111.11 a barrel. The European benchmark crude was at a premium
of $26.88 to the U.S. contract, breaking the record of $26.87
set on Sept. 6.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,206.51 at 3:09 p.m. in
New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 0.1 percent
to 11,505.23.  “It’s all about the economy,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “If the
economy looks good we go up, if the economy starts to sputter we
go down.”  Obama,  Iran   Oil pared its intraday loss after President  Barack Obama 
linked Iran to a foiled plan to assassinate the Saudi Arabian
ambassador to the U.S.  Obama said a person charged with plotting to kill Saudi
Ambassador Adel Al-Jubeir “had direct links, was paid by” and
“directed by individuals in the Iranian government.” He said
the U.S. would “continue to mobilize the international
community” to “make sure that Iran is further isolated.”
 Saudi Arabia  and Iran are OPEC’s top two oil producers.  Oil futures settled at a two-week high of $85.81 a barrel
on Oct. 11, capping the longest rally this year, as equities and
the euro rose as European officials worked to stem the
sovereign-debt crisis.  Slovakia Vote  Prices pared early losses after Slovakia became the last
European Union country to approve  Europe ’s enhanced bailout
fund. Euro-area countries will probably decide within 10 days on
the next aid payment for  Greece  and plan to avoid a “ credit
event ,” a European Union official who spoke on condition of
anonymity told reporters today in Brussels.  “Pullback in the euro and the equities are pressuring
prices,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy &
Economic Research in Winchester,  Massachusetts . “We’re not out
of the woods yet on Europe and Greece, and given that, the move
up to $85 seems overdone.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3796 at 3:10 p.m. in New
York from $1.3791 yesterday. Earlier, it touched $1.3685. The
European single currency gained 1.1 percent yesterday.  Oil supplies rose 1.34 million barrels to 337.6 million
last week, more than the 800,000-barrel median estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before the Energy Department
report. Refineries ran at 84.2 percent of capacity last week,
down from 87.7 percent the previous week.  Gasoline Stockpiles  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 4.13 million barrels, or 1.9
percent, to 209.6 million. They were forecast to gain 250,000
barrels in the Bloomberg News survey. Distillate fuel, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, fell 2.93 million
barrels, or 1.9 percent, to 154 million, more than the 500,000-
barrel drop forecast in the survey.  “What happens because of that drop in utilization is we
lose a lot of gasoline and a lot of distillate and build
crude,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and
research with Blue Ocean LLC in New York. “Overall demand was
lower this week.”  Total products supplied, a measure of consumption, fell 1.9
percent to 18.7 million barrels a day last week, the lowest
level since July, the department said. Gasoline demand increased
0.6 percent, the report showed.  Prices also dropped after the  American Petroleum Institute 
said yesterday that U.S. gasoline demand slid the most in more
than five years and as  China ’s net crude imports declined to the
third-lowest level this year, the customs bureau said today.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 663,981
contracts as of 3:12 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 678,063
contracts yesterday, 0.9 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.42 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
