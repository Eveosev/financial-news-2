The  European Central Bank  said
overnight deposits increased after the end of the maintenance
period.  Euro-region banks parked 105.5 billion euros ($145.6
billion) at the Frankfurt-based central bank on Oct. 12, up from
62.2 billion euros on the previous day, the last day of the
maintenance period. Financial institutions borrowed 3 billion
euros at the marginal rate of 2.25 percent, down from 4.2
billion.  Banks need to hold a certain amount of reserves on
average during an ECB maintenance period. This results in
fluctuations at the end of the period as lenders seek to balance  their accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
