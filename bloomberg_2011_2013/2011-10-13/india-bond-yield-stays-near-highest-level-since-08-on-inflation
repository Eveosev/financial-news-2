India ’s 10-year bond yield was near
its highest level since August 2008 before government data
tomorrow that’s forecast to show inflation in September was
little changed from a 13-month high reached in August.  The wholesale-price index rose 9.75 percent from a year
earlier after gaining 9.78 percent in August, according to the
median estimate of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
 finance ministry  will sell 130 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) of
notes due in 2018, 2021 and 2027 tomorrow. The 10-year yield
increased 29 basis points since the government boosted its bond-
sale target for the six months through March by 32 percent on
Sept. 29.  “The outlook for bonds continues to be bearish due to
concern over inflation and steady supply of bonds,” said Ganti
N. Murthy., head of fixed income in Mumbai at Peerless Mutual
Fund. “Investors will be watching the demand at auctions for
near-term cues.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 slipped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.73 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
reached a three-year high of 8.75 percent on Oct. 10. The price
increased 0.08, or 8 rupees per 10,000 rupee face amount, today
to 94.11.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
yesterday inflation must ease before the central bank can reduce
 interest rates . The central bank has increased the repurchase
rate six times this year to 8.25 percent.  The next policy review is on Oct. 25. Investors have
already factored in a 25 basis point increase in the repurchase
rate this month, Murthy said.  Inflation rate of more than 9 percent is above the Reserve
Bank of India’s “comfort level,” Subbarao said today.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 10 basis points to 8.07 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
