Amtrak  said two trains were involved
in a low-speed collision inside the Oakland, California,
station, resulting in the two lead engines of each train losing
contact with the rail.  The two trains, the San Joaquin from Bakersfield to Oakland
and the Coast Starlight from  Los Angeles  to Seattle, collided
about 10 p.m. local time yesterday. There were 17 confirmed,
non-life-threatening injuries to crew and passengers, Amtrak
said in an e-mailed statement.  All rail service into and out of the Oakland station is
temporarily suspended following the collision, Amtrak said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
