European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said Europe needs a “stronger” response to the
sovereign-debt crisis.  “It has to be a decisive, comprehensive response,”
Barroso told reporters today in Brussels after meeting with
Ireland Prime Minister  Enda Kenny . “We have very similar views
on what needs to be done to support  Greece  inside the euro, to
give maximum possible flexibility to the EFSF, to beef up
European banks’ capital positions.”  Barroso yesterday called for a “coordinated approach” to
recapitalize the region’s banks, the payout of a sixth loan to
Greece and a faster start for a permanent rescue fund.  On Ireland, the commission has “seen good, steady progress
in implementation of the program, and there are clear signs that
this is paying off,” Barroso said today. “Interest rates have
come down and growth has resumed. Continued strong policy
implementation remains essential, especially in the current
market conditions.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
