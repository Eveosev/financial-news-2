Brazil  announced the minimum bids
and other terms of its auction for the rights to renovate and
operate three of the countryâ€™s largest airports.  The minimum bid for the concession on Guarulhos airport in
 Sao Paulo  is 2.3 billion reais ($1.3 billion), Marcelo Guaranys,
president of the National Civil Aviation Agency, told reporters
in Brasilia. The minimum bid for Viracopos airport in Campinas
and for the international airport in Brasilia will be 521
million reais and 75 million reais respectively, Guaranys said.  The winning bidder for Guarulhos will be required to invest
4.8 billion reais during the 20-year term of the concession and
pay the government 10 percent of gross receipts. For Viracopos
the required investment will be 6.3 billion reais plus 5 percent
of receipts for a 30-year concession, and for Brasilia 2.2
billion reais investment plus 2 percent of receipts for a 25-
year concession.  Airlines using the airports will be required to pay the
operators 7 reais per passenger making a connection, Guaranys
said.  The auction is currently scheduled for Dec. 22, though the
federal audit court must first approve the terms, said Cleverson
Aroeira, executive secretary of the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
