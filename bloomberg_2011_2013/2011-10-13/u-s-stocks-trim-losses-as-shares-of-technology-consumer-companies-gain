U.S. stocks trimmed losses as gains
in technology and consumer companies helped the market recover
most of an early slide led by financial shares after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. reported a drop in profit.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped 0.2 percent to
1,204.37 at 2:56 p.m. in  New York  after tumbling as much as 1.4
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
