European stocks fell from a two-
month high as Chinese exports slowed and the  European Central
Bank  warned imposing further losses on holders of Greek debt
posed a risk to the euro area’s financial stability.  Carrefour SA (CA)  retreated 5.9 percent after saying its profit
may drop as much as 20 percent this year.  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  slid
4.5 percent after posting third-quarter revenue that missed
analysts’ estimates. Alcatel-Lucent surged 5.3 percent on a
report France’s biggest telecommunications equipment maker will
sell its corporate call-center business.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index dropped 1.1 percent to
236.53 at the close in  London . The gauge rose 1.7 percent
yesterday for its biggest six-day rally since January 2009. The
Stoxx 600 has still tumbled 19 percent from its high on Feb. 17
amid concern that the sovereign debt crisis in Europe will
spread from  Greece  to the larger economies of Italy and Spain.  “It’s too early to conclude that the euro-zone problems
will be solved,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, a senior strategist at
Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen. “It’s not the first time European
politicians have pledged to handle the problem once and for
all.”  European banks extended losses as the European Central Bank
said financial institutions’ involvement in euro-area bailouts
through enforced investor losses posed a risk to financial
stability and would have “direct negative effects” on lenders.  Austria’s  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  dropped 3.2
percent to 22.50 euros and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , Germany’s second-
biggest lender, slipped 4.8 percent to 1.76 euros.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) 
plunged 12 percent to 92.7 euro cents, its largest slide since
March 2009.  China ’s Exports Slow  China’s export growth slowed to its weakest pace in seven
months. Officials said that trade faces “severe challenges” as
the yuan strengthens and confidence slides in developed nations.  Exports climbed a less-than-forecast 17.1 percent in
September from a year earlier, customs bureau data showed in
Beijing today. The trade surplus of the world’s second-largest
economy fell to $14.51 billion last month from $17.76 billion in
August. Imports rose 20.9 percent, also less than forecast.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve officials moved closer to
setting targets for economic performance such as inflation to
decide how long to keep  interest rates  at a record low,
according to the minutes of their last meeting.  Federal Reserve Minutes  Most of the central bank’s 17 governors and regional bank
presidents “saw advantages” in the approach and judged it
would make policy more effective, the Fed said yesterday in the
minutes of the Sept. 20-21 meeting in  Washington . Some officials
wanted to keep more bond purchases as an option, according to
the minutes, which were released after European markets closed
yesterday.  National benchmark indexes fell in 16 of the 18 western-
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index slid 0.7 percent.
 France ’s CAC 40 Index and Germany’s DAX Index both slipped 1.3
percent.  Carrefour sank 5.9 percent to 16.85 euros after the world’s
second-largest retailer lowered its forecast for the second time
in three months, saying this year’s profit may fall further than
it had estimated because of a slump in Europe.  “Faced with an increasingly uncertain environment, we are,
as a matter of prudence, broadening the range of our 2011
current operating income guidance to a decline of 15 percent to
20 percent,” Chief Executive Officer Lars Olofsson said in a
statement. The Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company
forecast in August a 15 percent drop in profit from restated
2010 figures.  Mining Companies Decline  A gauge of mining shares posted the second-worst
performance of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx 600.
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  led commodity companies lower, falling 5.7 percent
to 878.5 pence.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer controlled
by the Luksic family, Chile’s richest, dropped 6.3 percent to
1,078 pence.  Roche sank 4.5 percent to 140.90 Swiss francs after
Europe’s second-largest drugmaker reported revenue that fell 15
percent as the franc gained and revenue declined for the
company’s three top medicines.  Group sales declined to 9.82 billion francs ($11 billion)
from 11.5 billion francs a year earlier, the Basel, Switzerland-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today. That missed
the 10.2 billion-franc average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Alcatel-Lucent Rallies  Alcatel-Lucent increased 5.3 percent to 2.18 euros after
the Financial Times reported that the company agreed to sell the
call-center business for as much as $1.5 billion to private-
equity firm Permira Advisers LLP. The newspaper did not say
where it got the information. Both companies declined to
comment.  Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/)  jumped 9.9 percent to 688 pence for
the largest gain on the Stoxx 600 after the jet-engine maker
agreed to sell its share in a venture making engines for the
Airbus A320 aircraft. Rolls-Royce sold its 32.5 percent stake in
International Aero Engines to  Pratt & Whitney  for $1.5 billion
and payments for 15 years.  Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB)  tumbled 6.9 percent to 235.1 pence
as Piedmont Inc. said it won’t proceed with its offer for the
owner of the All Bar One pub chain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
