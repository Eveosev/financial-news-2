Turkish automakers including Dogus
Otomotiv Servis & Ticaret AS,  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO)  and  Tofas
Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO)  will be hurt by an increase in
special consumption taxes on vehicles announced today, Ekspres
Invest said.  “Dogus Otomotiv will be hardest hit from the special
consumption tax as it’s a pure domestic play,” the Istanbul-
based brokerage said in a report sent to clients. “Ford Otosan
and Tofas will also be negatively affected.”  The government announced it was increasing the tax to 80-
to-130 percent for vehicles with engines larger than 1.6 liters,
up from 10-to-84 percent. New taxes for cigarettes, mobile
phones and alcoholic drinks were also announced in a directive
published in today’s Official Gazette in Ankara.  To contact the reporter on this story:
