Portugal  plans to deepen budget cuts
next year as it faces a moment of “national emergency,” Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said.  “Next year the adjustment will have to be much deeper,”
Passos Coelho said last night in a speech broadcast by
television station RTP following a cabinet meeting to discuss
the 2012 budget proposal. To meet its budget goals, Portugal has
to do more than it initially planned, he said.  The overrun in carrying out the 2011 budget, relative to
the financial aid program’s forecast, exceeds 3 billion euros
($4.1 billion), the prime minister said.  Passos Coelho is cutting spending and raising taxes to meet
the terms of a 78 billion-euro aid plan from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . The government has already
announced a one-time income-tax surcharge to help cover the
budget shortfall this year.  Portugal is “on track” to meet its 2011 deficit goal, a
team of EU and IMF inspectors said on Aug. 12. A month later,
the IMF said the government needed to improve control over
expenditure and cut spending to meet its targets as it seeks to
regain access to bond markets in 2013.  Summer, Christmas Payments  The 2012 budget includes a plan to eliminate the summer and
Christmas salary payments for state workers earning more than
1,000 euros a month, Passos Coelho said last night. As mentioned
in the financial aid program,  tax deductions  will be reduced and
the government plans to increase the value-added tax rate of
some goods.  The government will also consider an additional tax on
companies with profit of more than 10 million euros, Passos
Coelho said in parliament today.  Portugal will allow private sector working hours to
increase by 30 minutes a day during the next two years and will
adjust the holiday calendar as it tries to improve the economy’s
competitiveness. It won’t go ahead with a plan to reduce
employers’ social-security contributions for now, he said last
night.  “We know we can count on our international partners beyond
the current adjustment program, as long as we meet that
program,” Passos Coelho said.  The additional austerity measures are intended to help the
government meet its goal of trimming the  budget deficit  from 9.8
percent of gross domestic product in 2010 to 5.9 percent in 2011
and to the EU ceiling of 3 percent in 2013. Debt will reach
100.8 percent of GDP this year and peak at 106.8 percent in 2013
before starting to decline, the government predicted on Aug. 31.
Debt was 93.3 percent of GDP in 2010.  ‘Bold Measure’  “Clearly, the reduction in salaries is a bold measure,”
Nuno Miguel Matias, an analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank
in Lisbon, said today in a research note. “It will definitely
have a negative impact on consumption.”  The government has forecast the economy will contract 2.2
percent this year and by 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent in 2012,
before expanding 1.2 percent in 2013.  Borrowing costs have increased since the bailout was
requested. The difference in yield that investors demand to hold
Portugal’s 10-year bonds instead of German bunds reached a euro-
era record of 10.8 percentage points on July 12 and was at 9.46
today, up from 5.11 when former Prime Minister Jose Socrates
sought the rescue on April 6. On June 6, the day after Passos
Coelho defeated Socrates to take power, it was 6.70.  To contact the reporters on this story:
