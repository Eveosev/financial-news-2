Poland’s government will stay
“flexible” on the possibility of introducing changes to its
2012 budget bill, which must be resubmitted to the new
parliament set to convene no later than early November, Prime
Minister Donald Tusk said today at a news conference in Warsaw.  Tusk said it’s likely the 2012 budget will be passed with
no “major changes” from the bill submitted by the incumbent
government in September, providing nothing in the external
situation requires such changes.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
