Pattern Energy Group LP, a closely
held U.S. renewable power developer, received financing from
 Siemens AG (SIE)  to build a 75-megawatt wind farm in Puerto Rico.  Siemens will also provide turbines for the project in Finca
de Viento Santa Isabel, San Francisco-based Pattern said today
in a statement. Construction is set to begin this month and will
be complete in September. Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority
will buy the electricity under a 20-year contract. Details of
