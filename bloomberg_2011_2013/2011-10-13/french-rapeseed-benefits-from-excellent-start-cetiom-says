France ’s rapeseed crop had an
“excellent” start to the growing season in the country’s north
and east, with most plants developing seven to nine or more
leaves by mid-October, said Cetiom.  Crop establishment was “satisfactory” for more than 90
percent of plots, Paris-based Cetiom, the country’s technical
center for oilseed crops, said on its website today. “So
overall an excellent start to this campaign,” it said.  Northern and eastern France account for about 60 percent of
the country’s rapeseed production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
