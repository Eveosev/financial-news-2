ReNaissance Merchant Bank (Pvt)
Ltd., a Zimbabwean lender, asked the government’s National
Social Security Agency to invest in it, the Daily News said,
citing RMB curator Reggie Saruchera.  RMB was placed under interim management in June, the
Harare-based Daily News said on its website. Saruchera
“secured” RMB’s 33 percent shareholding in AFRE Corp., an
insurer listed on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the Daily News
reported. The NSSA has responded “positively” to the RMB
proposal, the Daily News quoted Saruchera as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
