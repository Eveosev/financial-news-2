Brazil ’s new index of commercial
confidence rose in August and September, the central bank and
the Getulio Vargas Foundation said.  The index, released for the first time today, is based on a
survey of 17 sectors, including wholesalers, retailers, vehicle
and auto parts and construction. It increased to 134.7 points in
September from 132.3 points in August and 129.5 points in July,
the central bank said.  “It indicates an index of confidence that is still
elevated,” the central bank’s head of economic research, Tulio Maciel, told reporters in Brasilia.  The measure is based on the average of an index measuring
perceptions of current demand, and an index of expectations. It
is intended to provide a snapshot of the Brazilian economy and
will be taken into account by the central bank’s rate-setting
committee, Maciel said.  “The movement of the indicator supports the interpretation
that the sector sustained a good level of activity at the end of
the third quarter, but it is still insufficient to conclude that
it entered a new phase of acceleration,” the Getulio Vargas
Foundation said in a statement.  The index’s three-month moving average fell 1.6 percent in
the third quarter from a year earlier, the central bank said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
