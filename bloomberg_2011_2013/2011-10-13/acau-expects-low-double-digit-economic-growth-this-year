Macau’s economy is expected to
maintain a “low double-digit” growth this year, Francis Tam,
the city’s secretary for economy and finance, said in a
statement posted on the government website.   Tourism business during the Chinese national holiday this
year was “better than expected,” Tam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
