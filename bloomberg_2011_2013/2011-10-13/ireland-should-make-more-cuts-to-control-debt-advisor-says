John McHale, Chairman of the Irish
Fiscal Advisory Council, said that Ireland should make further
budget savings next year to insure that its debt remains
sustainable.  “At the moment the debt does look to be on a sustainable
path,” said McHale, who heads an expert group established to
advise the government on fiscal matters in an interview with
Dublin-based RTE today. “It wouldn’t take that much to knock us
off that sustainable path.”  The council said yesterday it wants the government to bring
its  budget deficit  down to 1 percent of gross domestic product
by 2015. McHale said he is urging the government to make 4.4
billion euros in savings next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
