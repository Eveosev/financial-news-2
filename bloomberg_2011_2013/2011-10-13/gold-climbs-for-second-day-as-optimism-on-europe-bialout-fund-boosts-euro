Gold fell for the second time this
week in  New York  as equities declined and gains in the dollar
curbed demand for the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback climbed as much as 0.6 percent against a
basket of six major currencies after a report showed exports
from  China  rose the least in seven months. The dollar advanced 6
percent last month, while bullion declined 11 percent. The MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities fell as much 1.1 percent.  “Gold is muted by the strength in the dollar,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Gold is taking cues
from other markets.”  Gold futures for December delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,668.50 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices have slumped 13 percent since touching a record
$1,923.70 on Sept. 6.  The precious metal still has gained 17 percent this year,
heading for an 11th annual gain. Investors have increased
purchases as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis and financial
turmoil boosted demand for a haven.  “Ultimately, given the ongoing government-debt-related
crisis, safe-haven gold is still appealing to investors and
buying should push the price higher over the rest of the
quarter,” said Nikos Kavalis, an analyst at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London.  Silver futures for December delivery dropped 3.4 percent to
$31.667 an ounce, the most since Sept. 28. Today’s fall ended a
three-day rally, the longest in seven weeks.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 1.4 percent to $1,532.40 an ounce,
retreating for the second time in three days. Palladium futures
for December delivery slid 2.8 percent to $594.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
