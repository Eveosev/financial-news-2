A widening gap between rich and poor
is reshaping the  U.S. economy , leaving it more vulnerable to
recurring financial crises and less likely to generate enduring
expansions.  Left unchecked, the decades-long trend toward increasing
inequality may condemn  Wall Street  to a generation of
unimpressive returns and even shake social stability, economists
and financial-industry executives say.  “Income inequality in this country is just getting worse
and worse and worse,” James Chanos, president and founder of
New York-based Kynikos Associates Ltd., told Bloomberg Radio
this week. “And that is not a recipe for stable economic growth
when the rich are getting richer and everybody else is being
left behind.”  Since 1980, about 5 percent of annual national income has
shifted from the middle class to the nation’s richest
households. That means the wealthiest 5,934 households last year
enjoyed an additional $650 billion -- about $109 million apiece
-- beyond what they would have had if the economic pie had been
divided as it was in 1980, according to Census Bureau data.  Disputes over what constitutes economic fairness are moving
to center stage amid a near-stagnant U.S. economy saddled with
9.1 percent unemployment yet boasting record corporate profits.
President  Barack Obama  last month targeted “the wealthiest
taxpayers and biggest corporations” for higher taxes, saying
they should pay “their fair share.” That drew charges of
“class warfare” from House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.  ‘Occupy Wall Street’  The debate comes as demonstrations in New York by an
amorphous group called “Occupy Wall Street” move into their
27th day. The rallies over what protesters call unbridled
corporate power began in lower Manhattan’s Zuccotti Park, a few
blocks from Wall Street, and have spawned copycats in several
U.S. cities.  “We are the 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the
greed and corruption of the 1 percent,” says the
occupywallstreet.org  web site .  The reference is to the fact that a sliver of U.S.
households have enjoyed a disproportionate share of recent
economic rewards. Between 1993 and 2008, the top 1 percent of
families captured 52 percent of total income gains, according to
a 2010 analysis of Internal Revenue Service tax data by
economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California,
Berkeley.  Defended Protesters  Howard Buffett , the Berkshire Hathaway Inc. director and
son of Chairman Warren Buffett, defended the Wall Street
protesters in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday.  “There has never been a larger gap between earnings in
this country,” Buffett said. “There has never been a time in
my lifetime when the government is going to cut an incredible
amount of programs that support poor people and feed them.”  Such trends have left their mark on public sentiment.
Though a majority of Americans reject the idea that the country
is divided between “haves” and “have-nots,” those seeing
such a divide rose to 45 percent from 35 percent in 2009,
according to a  Pew Research  Center poll released Sept. 29. The
sharpest increase occurred among self-described political
independents.  Economists such as the late Arthur Okun, a chairman of the
White House Council of Economic Advisers in the 1960s,
traditionally believed that societies could emphasize equality
or growth, not both. Now, in an age where the quality of human
capital plays a larger role in determining economic outcomes,
many economists -- including Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  -- say the two are linked.  Growing Gap  “The large and growing gap between the haves and have-nots
will tend to undermine growth, both directly and indirectly --
including by reducing the marginal propensity to consume and by
amplifying the political polarization that has already
contributed to poor economic policymaking,” says Mohamed El- Erian, chief executive officer of Pacific Investment Management
Co. in Newport Beach,  California .  Branko Milanovic, a World Bank economist, added in a
September article: “Widespread education has become the secret
to growth. And broadly accessible education is difficult to
achieve unless a society has a relatively even income
distribution.”  Since 1968, incomes in the U.S. have become steadily less
equally distributed, according to the standard statistical
measure of inequality known as the Gini coefficient. The U.S.
Gini score rose from .39 in 1968 to .47 in 2010, meaning that
incomes were becoming increasingly unequal.  Distributional Thermometer  Developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912,
the scores represent a kind of distributional thermometer,
ranging from 0 (each person enjoying equal shares of income) to
1 (one person has all income).  In the 30-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, only Turkey and Mexico have more unequal societies
than the  United States . In the U.S., the rich-poor gap widened
by 20 percent since the mid-1980s, more than in most developed
countries. “Nowhere has this trend been so stark as in the
United States,” the OECD concluded in a 2008 study.  Economic gains in the U.S. have been spread less equally in
recent years as a result of factors including globalization,
technological change, the decline of labor unions, changing
social norms, and government trade and tax policies, say
economists such as the World Bank’s Milanovic.  ‘Take Advantage’  “We have inequities,”  David Plouffe , a senior White House
adviser said on “Fox News Sunday” Sept. 25. “The American
people are screaming out saying it’s unfair that the wealthiest,
the largest corporations who can afford the best attorneys, the
best accountants, take advantage of these special tax
treatments.”  Not everyone shares that view. Economist Tyler Cowen, a
professor at  George Mason University  in Fairfax, Virginia, says
concerns over  income inequality  are exaggerated. “I don’t think
it matters one way or another for macroeconomics,” he says.  Cowen, who also writes the “Marginal Revolution” blog,
says only the most extreme manifestation of inequality involving
the top 1 percent of the income distribution is worrisome. And
that, he says, is almost entirely a function of distorted
incentives in the financial industry. “Fix the financial sector
and inequality will take care of itself,” he says.  In the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the
fortunes of labor and capital have diverged. After plunging in
the two years leading to December 2008, total corporate profits
have roared back to a new high of $1.5 trillion, 6.5 percent
above the previous peak reached in September 2006.  Lost Ground  The typical American household, meanwhile, has yet to
regain the ground it lost during the recession. The median
income of $49,445 at the end of 2010 remained below the level
reached in 1997.  The widening chasm between haves and have-nots has tangible
consequences. Societies with a narrower gap between rich and
poor enjoy longer economic expansions, according to research
published this year by the  International Monetary Fund . Income
trends in the U.S., where the wealthy over time have pulled away
from the rest of society, mean that future U.S. expansions could
last just one-third as long as in the late 1960s, before the
income divide began widening, said economist Jonathan Ostry of
the IMF.  Expansions -- or what Ostry and coauthor Andrew Berg label
“growth spells” -- fizzle sooner in less equal societies
because they are more vulnerable to both financial crises and
political instability. When such countries are hit by external
shocks, they often stumble into gridlock rather than agree to
tough policies needed to keep growth alive.  ‘Increased Inequality’  “Increased inequality is likely to diminish the duration
of expansions,” Ostry said in an interview.  The average postwar economic expansion lasted 4.8 years,
according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. The
current expansion, which is just 27 months old, may already be
petering out. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Oct. 3 that the U.S.
would be “on the edge of recession” by early 2012, adding that
the firm now expects first-quarter growth to be 0.5 percent.  Some say the wider rich-poor gap is an additional
impediment to recovery. “Very high levels of inequality seem to
be associated with slower economic growth,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist for JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Raghuram Rajan , the IMF’s former chief economist, says
countries with high levels of inequality tend to produce
ineffective economic policies. Political systems in economically
divided countries grow polarized and immobilized by the sort of
zero-sum politics now gripping  Washington , he said.  ‘No Consensus’  “It makes the politics more difficult, and that makes it
more difficult to grow,” said Rajan, now a finance professor at
the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. “There is
no consensus on any of the solutions that are proposed.”  As rich and poor drift apart, the constituency for
redistributive tax and spending policies grows. The 30.5 million
American households that earned less than $25,000 in 2010 were
almost seven times the number making more than $200,000,
according to new Census Bureau figures. In 2000, the ratio was
5.6-to-1.  “The guys who are falling behind don’t see much hope of
getting ahead and therefore are more focused on
redistribution,” Rajan said.  Ultimately, unbridled inequality threatens social stability
as rich and poor separately nurse their mirror-image
resentments. Bernanke last year told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that
rising inequality was leading to “a society which doesn’t have
the cohesion that we’d like to see.”  Austerity Policies  In the U.S. and  Europe , austerity policies may be
exacerbating the trend. Already, European capitals, including
London, Madrid and Athens, have witnessed street protests in
response to reduced government spending and subsidies.  New York  Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  -- speaking in September
before the confrontations between police and “Occupy Wall
Street” demonstrators -- alluded to the danger that persistent
unemployment could spark social unrest.  “You have a lot of kids graduating college, can’t find
jobs,” he told WOR radio, before mentioning protests that
topped Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Spanish anti-
austerity demonstrations.  “You don’t want those kinds of riots here,” said
Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the
parent of Bloomberg News.  Rigged Game  On the surface, inequality might appear to be a problem of
the have-nots. Yet the haves will suffer, too.  Barry Ritholtz ,
CEO of the investment research firm Fusion IQ, says millions of
potential investors may conclude, as they did following the
Great Depression, that the stock market is a rigged game for
insiders.  Such seismic shifts in popular sentiment can have lasting
effects. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  didn’t regain its
September 1929 peak of 355.95 until the same month in 1954.  “You’re going to lose an entire generation of investors,”
says Ritholtz. “And that’s how you end up with a 25-year  bear
market . That’s the risk if people start to think there is no
economic justice.”  Rising inequality contributed to the onset of previous
financial crises and may already be laying the groundwork for
the next one, some economists say.  During both the 1920s and the most recent decade, the rich
enjoyed large income gains, much of which were made available to
the working poor and middle class via credit channels.
Politicians encouraged the resort to credit as a way to bridge
the gap for those struggling to sustain living standards amid
flatlining wage income, according to Rajan’s 2010 book “ Fault
Lines .”  Nearly Doubled  As a result, household debt nearly doubled in both periods,
setting the stage for the Great Depression and the most recent
financial crisis, says a December 2010 paper by economists
Michael Kumhof and Romain Ranciere of the IMF. That increasing
debt burden left the economy exposed to widespread defaults when
a financial shock hit.  For many consumers, easy access to credit today is a thing
of the past. Government fiscal policy -- in the form of payroll
tax cuts and transfer payments -- is filling the gap between
income and consumption the way easy credit did during the boom
years.  “The missing credit temporarily is being filled in by
fiscal measures,” said Feroli. “But we have yet to understand
or see how a post-leverage, post-fiscal support household sector
will behave.”  Financial Crisis  The government’s response to the financial crisis may also
have exacerbated the rich-poor gap by shifting liabilities from
private banks to taxpayers. Households and businesses have
trimmed their debts since the 2008 peak while government
borrowing -- to recapitalize the nation’s banks and battle the
recession -- has exploded.  As a result, total domestic nonfinancial sector debt topped
$36.5 trillion at mid-year, compared with $32.4 trillion in mid-
2008. And that massive load leaves the economy vulnerable to
future shocks.  “In the current climate, if nothing is done about income
inequality there may be recurring crises,” says Kumhof, adding:
“Leverage has not significantly improved. In terms of the
danger of another crisis, we’re right back where we started.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
