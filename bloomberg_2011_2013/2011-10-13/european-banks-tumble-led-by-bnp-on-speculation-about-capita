European banking stocks tumbled, led
by  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , on speculation that policy
makers will make lenders raise more capital.  The 46-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index fell as much as 3.3 percent, extending this year’s drop to
29 percent. French lenders BNP Paribas and  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) 
plunged as much as much as 9.2 percent and 6.3 percent,
respectively, while Italy’s UniCredit slid as much as 8.1
percent and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA dropped 5.7 percent.  Policy makers are debating how to recapitalize the region’s
troubled banks as the sovereign-debt crisis threatens to damage
balance sheets and undermine prospects for economic recovery. At
least 66 lenders would fail a revised European Union stress test
and need to raise about 220 billion euros ($302 billion) of
capital in a rerun of the exercise that used a 9 percent core
Tier 1 capital ratio rather than the 5 percent used in July,
Credit Suisse AG analysts said today in a report.  “It has to do with general concern about the stress tests
and the issue of capital,” Christoph Bossman, a banking analyst
at WestLB AG in Dusseldorf, Germany, said by telephone.  Bankers may have to give up bonuses and shareholders may
forgo dividends at lenders that need capital injections to meet
tougher European Union standards, EU President  Jose Barroso  said
yesterday when he announced plans to recapitalize banks.  The EU’s top banking regulator, the European Banking
Authority, is considering setting a temporary capital benchmark
of 9 percent as part of Barroso’s plan, a person with knowledge
of the talks said yesterday.  Austria’s  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  fell as much as
6.5 percent and Madrid-based  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  declined as much
as 3.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
