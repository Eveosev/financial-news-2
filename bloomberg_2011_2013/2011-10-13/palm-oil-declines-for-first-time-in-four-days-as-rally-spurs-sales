  Palm oil  dropped for the first time
in four days as a rally to the highest level in more than a week
yesterday spurred some investors to lock in gains.  December-delivery futures declined as much as 1 percent to
2,835 ringgit ($905) a metric ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 2,861 ringgit a ton.  Palm oil rose 3.3 percent in the three sessions before
today on higher exports from Malaysia during the first 10 days
of October and lower soybean production estimates. U.S. output
will total 3.06 billion bushels, down from last year’s 3.329
billion, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.  “Commodities have reacted ahead of the bullish data as can
be seen by the gains this week, and people have priced in the
news,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Group Holdings Bhd., said by
phone from  Kuala Lumpur . “It’s more like buy on rumors and sell
on news.”  Futures also fell on concern that rising prices may cool
demand, she said.  Soybeans for delivery in November fell 0.7 percent to
$12.3175 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 11:30 a.m. in
Mumbai, while  soybean oil  for December delivery was little
changed at to 51.83 cents per pound. Palm oil competes with
soybean oil for use in food and fuel.  Palm oil for delivery in May declined as much as 0.5
percent to 7,936 yuan ($1,244) per ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange and soybean oil for delivery in the same month fell as
much as 0.4 percent to 9,256 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
