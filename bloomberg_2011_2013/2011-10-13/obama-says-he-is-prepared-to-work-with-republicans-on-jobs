President  Barack Obama  said he is
willing to work with Republicans in Congress to create jobs, as
he called on lawmakers to vote on the parts of his jobs act
proposal.  “I’ve shown repeatedly my willingness to work overtime to
get them to do something” to help create jobs, he said. “I
don’t know when rebuilding our roads and bridges that are
decaying became a partisan issue.”  Obama spoke at a joint White House news conference with
South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who is on a state visit to
 Washington .  He said approval in Congress yesterday of free trade
agreements with  South Korea , Colombia and Panama show that the
political parties can work together to help the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
