Some banks in  Europe  may be required
to maintain a 9 percent capital buffer to address sovereign
risks, a European Union official said.  That is one of the figures the European Banking Authority
is working on as part of an assessment of which lenders need a
temporary buffer of extra capital, the EU official told
reporters today in Brussels on the condition of anonymity.  The EU plans a coordinated recapitalization of banks to
stem the sovereign-debt crisis. Under the plans, systemic banks
would first seek market finance, then tap national governments
if private funding fails and, finally, fall back on the euro-
area rescue fund if necessary.  A possible timetable for any recapitalization is three
months to six months, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
