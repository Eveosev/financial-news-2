India ’s rupee weakened, reversing
gains, on concern foreign investors will sell the nation’s
financial assets after Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said inflation
must ease before the central bank can reduce borrowing costs.  The currency declined before a government report tomorrow
that economists in a Bloomberg survey said may show wholesale
prices rose 9.75 percent last month, versus 9.78 percent in
August. This is sustaining pressure for higher  interest rates 
even as consumer demand wanes and threatens growth. The rupee
gained earlier on optimism policy makers will contain the debt
crisis in  Europe .  “It might be difficult for the currency to maintain
sustained gains in the short term amid prevailing global
uncertainties and rising domestic concerns around growth and
inflation,” L. Subramanian, a currency analyst in Mumbai at
ICICI Bank Ltd. wrote in a note today.  The rupee weakened 0.3 percent to 49.1250 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  European Central Bank  said forcing investors to take
losses in euro-area bailouts risks financial stability. European
Commission President Jose Barroso yesterday called for a
“coordinated approach” to recapitalize the region’s banks.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.78 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.61 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
