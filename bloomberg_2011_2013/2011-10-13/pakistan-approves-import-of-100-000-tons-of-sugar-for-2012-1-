Pakistan ,  Asia ’s third-biggest sugar
consumer, approved the import of 100,000 metric tons of the
sweetener for 2012, said Naveed Iqbal, a spokesman for the
 finance ministry .  The permission compared with an industries ministry
recommendation of 700,000 tons of imports, a statement from the
finance ministry said. The purchase aims to build stockpiles and
prevent a surge in prices, according to the statement.  Floods in the country’s southern Sindh province inundated
about 1.97 million acres of farmland this year, damaging cane,
cotton and rice crops, the local government said on Sept. 14.  Sindh will produce less than 1 million tons of sugar next
year compared with an estimated 1.3 million tons, Agha Jan
Akhtar, the state’s farm secretary, said yesterday in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
