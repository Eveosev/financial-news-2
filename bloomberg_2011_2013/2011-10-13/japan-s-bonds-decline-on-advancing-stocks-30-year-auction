Japan ’s 10-year bonds declined for a
fifth day, the longest slide in three months, as advancing
stocks sapped demand for the relative safety of government debt.  Thirty-year yields climbed after the Ministry of Finance
sold 638 billion-yen ($8.28 billion) of the securities, drawing
bids valued at 3.27 times the amount on offer, the lowest ratio
since June. Bond transactions started more than three hours late
due to system problems, according to Japan Bond Trading Co.  “Considering that  risk aversion  is easing globally and the
Nikkei 225 is holding firm, it’s natural that bonds are weighed
on,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in  Tokyo  at
Okasan Securities Co., one of the 25 primary dealers obliged to
bid at government debt sales. “In general, 30-year yields below
2 percent aren’t a level at which investors willingly buy.”  The benchmark 10-year yield increased two basis points, or
0.02 percentage points, to 1.015 percent as of 3:51 p.m. Tokyo
time at Japan Bond Trading, the nation’s largest interdealer
debt broker. The 1 percent security maturing in September 2021
declined 0.181 yen to 99.864 yen. The five-day drop in price was
the longest losing streak since July 5.  Thirty-year yields rose 2.5 basis points to 1.935 percent,
while 20-year rates climbed three basis points to 1.73 percent.  Ten-year bond futures for December delivery fell to as low
as 142.13, the least since Sept. 1, before finishing the
afternoon session at 142.24 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
