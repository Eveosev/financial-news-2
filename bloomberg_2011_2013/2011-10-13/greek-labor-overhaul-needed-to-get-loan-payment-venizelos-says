Greece ’s Parliament must approve
changes to collective-labor laws before the nation can receive
its next bailout loan, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
said.  The demand was spelled out by the “troika” of inspectors
from the European Union, the  European Central Bank  and the IMF
that assesses Greek progress in meeting the terms of last year’s
110 billion-euro ($150 billion) rescue, Venizelos said in  Athens 
today.  “A summary version of the troika’s report was presented to
the International Monetary Fund’s managing board the day before
yesterday, and the first item listed as a ‘prior action’ before
anything can happen is to change collective-labor relations,”
Venizelos told a parliamentary committee meeting.  Lawmakers are debating reforms required to receive the
sixth bailout payment, an 8 billion-euro loan vital to helping
Greece avert default. One measure makes it easier to negotiate
company-level labor accords instead of industry-wide agreements.  Venizelos and Prime Minister  George Papandreou  have said
that parliamentary approval of those measures and next year’s
budget before a summit of EU leaders on Oct. 23 will help the
country in “difficult” loan negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
