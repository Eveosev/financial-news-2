Depomed Inc. (DEPO) , the maker of an
experimental drug to treat menopausal hot flashes, declined as
much as 32 percent in extended trading after saying the drug
failed to meet one of four objectives in a late-stage study.  The medicine, Serada, was effective for three of the four
primary endpoints evaluating the frequency and severity of hot
flashes at four and 12 weeks of treatment,  Menlo Park ,
California-based Depomed said today in a statement.  The company said it will review the results of the Phase 3
clinical trial, the last of three phases of studies generally
required for U.S. marketing clearance, with the  Food and Drug
Administration  and discuss “possible pathways” to filing a
drug-approval application.  “We believe the data are sufficient to warrant discussion
with the agency,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Schoeneck said in
the statement. “We continue to believe Serada can offer
clinical benefit as a non-hormonal treatment option for women
suffering from menopausal hot flashes.”  In the trial, Serada failed to reduce the average daily
frequency of hot flashes after 12 weeks, the company said. The
drug met the three other goals of reducing the frequency of hot
flashes after four weeks, and the severity after four and 12
weeks. The treatment failed to meet secondary goals of reducing
the frequently and severity of hot flashes after 24 weeks.  Depomed’s shares dropped to as low as $4.30 in extended
trading after gaining 3.6 percent to $6.28 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
