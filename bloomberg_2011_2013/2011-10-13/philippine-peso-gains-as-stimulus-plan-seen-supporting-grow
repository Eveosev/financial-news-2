The  Philippine peso  gained for a
second day on optimism a government plan to boost spending will
spur economic growth. Bonds dropped.  The currency traded near its strongest level in a month
after President  Benigno Aquino  unveiled a $1.7-billion stimulus
package yesterday after official data showed exports slumped in
August by the most since September 2009. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of regional shares rose as  Slovakia ’s main political
parties agreed to changes to the European Financial Stability
Facility that will pave the way for an enhanced bailout fund.  “The stimulus package should be a good help to the
economy,” said Ed Garcia, a currency trader at East West
Banking Corp. in Manila. “The peso is benefiting mostly from
improving news in  Europe , even though we still expect to see
volatility and uncertainty.”  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 43.37 per dollar as of 4:15
p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It reached
43.180 on Oct. 11, the strongest level since Sept. 14. The
currency may trade between 43.15 and 43.65 over the next few
weeks, Garcia said.  The currency pared gains after an official report showed
 China ’s exports grew at the slowest pace in seven months.
Overseas shipments rose 17.1 percent from a year earlier,
compared with the median 20.5 percent median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The Philippine government cut its 2011 growth forecast
yesterday to a range of 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent, from 5
percent to 6 percent earlier. Exports declined 15.1 percent in
August from a year earlier after shrinking 1.7 percent in July.
China, including  Hong Kong , was the nation’s largest overseas
market last year.  The yield on the 8 percent government notes maturing in
July 2031 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
6.975 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The government is seeking to buy back about $1.5 billion of
its existing dollar- and euro-denominated bonds to help cut its
interest expenses. About $17.5 billion worth of those securities
are eligible for tender, which closes in  New York  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
