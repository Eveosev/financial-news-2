EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal business will
expand its partnership with  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  to let consumers buy
virtual goods over its game consoles, part of an effort to lure
more users to its payment products.  PayPal customers will be able to purchase goods over
Microsoft’s Xbox 360 game consoles, the company said today at
EBay’s developer conference in  San Francisco . PayPal expects
$4.7 billion in payment volume for digital goods this year,
compared with $3.4 billion in 2010.  “It’s symbolic of us moving beyond just the browser as a
payment experience,” Carey Kolaja, senior director of emerging
opportunities at PayPal, said in an interview.  EBay, based in  San Jose ,  California , is vying for a share
of a video  game industry  that will generate about $30 billion in
software sales worldwide this year, more than half of that
through consoles, said  Colin Sebastian , an analyst at Robert W.
Baird & Co. in San Francisco. Content purchases on TVs and game
consoles are a “huge” opportunity if PayPal can integrate the
technology in a way that is simple to use, he said.  PayPal also will provide new ways to pay for content with
partners such as the Financial Times and  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Wall
Street Journal, and will team up with Blizzard Entertainment
Inc. in gaming and Spotify Ltd. in digital music, the company
said today.  Easier Payment  Allowing customers to log in and pay with a user name and
password rather than interrupting a game to enter credit card
information is something PayPal has that other companies don’t,
said  Gil Luria , an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los
Angeles . With more than 100 million users, the company will
attract game junkies who want to buy virtual goods, he said.  “Much of the potential for growth for PayPal beyond the
Web has to do with its ability to become the preferred payment
choice for in-product purchases such as Zynga’s games --
FarmVille, CityVille,” where more than 90 percent of revenue
came from virtual goods, Luria said.  As it moves more services from personal computers to
devices including mobile phones and tablet computers, PayPal
could expand revenue 10-fold to more than $32 billion from its
shift into advertising, said Richard Crone, head of research
firm Crone Consulting LLC.  PayPal has done an independent study on the benefits of
expanding into commerce over televisions, and will announce the
results later this year, the company said. More conceptual
ideas, such as paying for food in a car before reaching a drive-
through window, or adding payment options to navigation systems
are possibilities that will depend on consumer demand, Kolaja
said.  T-commerce Growth  “We’re creating the tech stack and the platform to go onto
any device, whatever the market may dictate at a given time,”
Kolaja said. “Is ’t-commerce’ going to be a growth area in the
future? I tend to think it will,” she said, referring to paying
for products over televisions.  Today’s announcement is an extension of PayPal’s effort to
make payments easier in a number of mediums. For local
retailers, the company is rolling out products that will let
consumers pay through a mobile phone application, by swiping a
card or by entering a name and PIN number at the point of sale
in a store, said Sara Gorman, a PayPal spokeswoman. The company
will test the products with a “major” retailer by the end of
this year and introduce them more extensively in 2012, she said.  While PayPal’s system would be simpler to use in television
commerce than entering credit card information, competing with
companies such as Google Inc., the largest Internet search
company, and  Visa Inc. (V) , the biggest payments network, won’t be
easy, Luria said.  “It’s not that much of a stretch to be able to do that on
the TV,” Luria said. “You’re starting to see that
functionality come. PayPal isn’t going to be the only one who
does it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
