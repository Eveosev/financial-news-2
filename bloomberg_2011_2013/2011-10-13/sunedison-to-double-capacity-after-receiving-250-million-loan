SunEdison, the solar project
development unit of  MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR) , will more
than double its installed capacity after receiving $250 million
in financing to build 51 solar power plants in Thailand.  The financing from the Overseas Private Investment Corp.,
an independent U.S. government agency, will allow SunEdison to
set up 520 megawatts of photovoltaic plants, OPIC said in a
 statement .  The plants will have capacities of one megawatt to 50
megawatts each and will supply electricity to Thailand’s
national grid, OPIC said.  SunEdison, which raised $26.1 million in private equity
funding led by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  in 2006, has an
installed solar capacity to date of 330 megawatts, according to
OPIC.  The Belmont, California-based company has developed,
financed and operates solar projects for customers including
 Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) ,  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the world’s largest
brewer, and the U.S. Department of Energy, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
