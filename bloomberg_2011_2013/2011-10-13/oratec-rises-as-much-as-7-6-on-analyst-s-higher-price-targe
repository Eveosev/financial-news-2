Thoratec Corp. (THOR) , maker of the only
U.S. approved implantable heart pump, rose the most in six
months after rival  HeartWare International Inc. (HTWR)  failed to get a
slot in the final regulatory advisory panel hearing for 2011.  Thoratec rose 6.6 percent to $36.13 after the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration said next month’s hearing will review
devices from Minneapolis-based  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  and Atlanta-based
CardioMems Inc. that don’t compete with Thoratec’s heart pump.
HeartWare fell 3.5 percent to $62.04.  The possibility that Framingham, Massachusetts-based
HeartWare will gain a panel review this year is gone, Thomas Gunderson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, said
today in a telephone interview. Thoratec, based in Pleasanton,
 California , has the market to itself in the U.S., while
HeartWare’s device is available in Europe and has about half of
the German market, Gunderson said.  “It’s a zero-sum game,” he said. “This means HeartWare
can’t get onto a panel until 2012, and their entry into the U.S.
is delayed a little bit. Every time they are delayed, that means
Thoratec gets a little longer time of almost near-exclusive use
in the U.S.”  Thoratec makes the HeartMate ventricular assist devices,
designed to help shoulder the workload for a failing heart. A
study released at the  American Heart Association  meeting a year
ago in Chicago found patients getting HeartWare’s 5-ounce pump
had a 92 percent survival rate after six months, compared with
an average of 90 percent survival in a national registry of
patients who mostly received Thoratec’s HeartMate II.  To contact the reporters on this story:
