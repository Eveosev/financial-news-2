Poland ’s current-account deficit
narrowed in August as exports unexpectedly rose, suggesting the
European Union’s biggest eastern economy is weathering the euro
area’s sovereign-debt crisis.  The shortfall was 1.73 billion euros ($2.38 billion)
compared with a revised 2.04 billion euros in July, the central
bank said today on its website. That’s wider than the 1.37
billion-euro median forecast of 27 economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  The  International Monetary Fund  revised its 2011 economic-
growth estimate for Poland down to 3.8 percent from 4 percent
Sept. 20 amid concern the euro debt crisis will damp demand for
the country’s products among its western neighbors. Poland’s
economy expanded 4.3 percent from a year earlier in the second
quarter, slowing from 4.4 percent growth in the first.  “The export figures were a positive surprise and confirmed
earlier predictions that the influence of the economic slowdown
in the  euro zone  on Polish industry will be moderate,” said
economists at Bank Zachodni WBK in a note to clients.  Exports rose 8.3 percent from July to 11.6 billion euros,
the central bank said, above a median estimate of 10.7 billion
euros. Imports increased 3.7 percent to 12.4 billion euros,
topping the 11.7 billion-euro median estimate.  “Given the volatility in this series, we believe it isn’t
possible to conclude anything beyond a very gradual
consolidation of the external deficit,”  Raffaella Tenconi , an
economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in  London , said by
phone. The balance of payments will only improve on a more
sustainable basis “at the end of this year or early 2012,” she
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
