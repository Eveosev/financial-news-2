Dan Carter  expects a full recovery
in about three months after surgery on the groin injury that
forced the All Blacks playmaker out of the  World Cup , the New
Zealand Rugby Union said.  Carter, the record points scorer in elite Tests, will
undertake a graduated rehabilitation program after the Oct. 10
surgery to repair his torn left adductor tendon “went well,”
the NZRU said.  His recovery “will involve re-establishing normal walking
with strengthening exercises, with a view to progressing onto
running and kicking over an eight-week period,” the Wellington-
based governing body said today in a statement. “He hopes to be
fully recovered by about the 12-week mark.”  Carter, 29, was withdrawn from the All Blacks’ squad after
injuring his groin during kicking practice on Oct. 1, the day
before the team’s final pool game against Canada.  Colin Slade , Carter’s backup, was himself ruled out of the
tournament after injuring the same part of his groin during New
Zealand’s quarterfinal win over Argentina.  Aaron Cruden, who was called up to the 30-man squad as
Carter’s replacement, was today named at fly-half for the
semifinal against Australia in two days at Auckland’s  Eden Park .  To contact the reporter on this story:
