Sina Corp., the owner of the
Twitter-like Weibo service in  China , rose the most in three
months after a senior government official encouraged agencies to
use microblogs for information disclosure.  Sina’s shares jumped 14 percent, the most since June 21, to
$89.43 at 11:52 a.m. New York time, the highest intraday level
in more than two weeks.
  Government agencies and officials should “actively” use
microblogs to communicate with people, disclose official
information, respond to “societal concerns,” and improve the
government’s work, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
today, citing a speech of  Wang Chen , chief of the Information
Office of China’s State Council, at a meeting in Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
