New Jersey ’s pension-fund assets
dropped 9.9 percent to $66.4 billion in the first three months
of this fiscal year as global stocks declined, according to a
report presented to the State Investment Council.  Assets as of the June 30 end of last fiscal year were $73.7
billion, after an 18 percent gain during the 12-month period.
Since July 1, the fund for government workers has withdrawn $1.8
billion for benefit payments, according to a summary from the
state Division of Investment.  The funds returned less than 1 percent in July before
declining 2.9 percent in August and an estimated 4.2 percent in
September, according to the report. International equity
investments lost 22.8 percent during the three months while
domestic stocks declined 15.9 percent. Fixed income returned
about 9 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 14.3 percent in the
July-September quarter.  The Division of Investment manages funds for seven public
retirement systems that provide benefits for more than 780,000
current and future retirees.  Alternatives Strategy  Hedge-fund investments dropped 3 percent for the quarter
and commodities, with an estimated $100 million invested in gold
and gold mining, were down 5 percent.  The pension pool intends to invest as much as $1.29 billion
in alternative investments, which include hedge funds and real
estate, to diversify beyond stocks and bonds, according to memos
from Timothy Walsh, director of the investment division. As of
June 30, about $13.2 billion, or 17.9 percent, of the fund’s
portfolio was in alternatives.  The largest of the new investments is $200 million in
Elliott Associates LP, a New York-based hedge fund founded by
 Paul Singer  that focuses on distressed credit. Walsh also plans
to invest as much as $200 million in Brevan Howard LP, a London-
based hedge fund that manages an estimated $34 billion,
including $26.1 billion in its flagship Brevan Howard Master
Fund Ltd.  The pension system also will put $110 million in London-
based AnaCap Credit Opportunities II LP, which buys credit-card
debt, residential and commercial mortgages and liens with a
focus on the U.K., Ireland,  Portugal  and  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
