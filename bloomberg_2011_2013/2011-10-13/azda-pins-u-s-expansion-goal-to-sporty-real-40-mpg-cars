Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  says it’s making
“real-world” fuel-efficiency a core attribute of a brand that
mainly touts sporty handling as the Japanese carmaker seeks to
lift U.S. volume 74 percent by mid-decade from last year.  Mazda next week begins U.S. sales of revamped Mazda3
compact cars with its Skyactiv engine and transmission that
improves fuel mileage by 18 percent, said Robert Davis, senior
vice president of U.S. operations. Cars with the powertrain get
40 mpg in highway driving without slowing acceleration, he said.  “It’s not acceptable to us have 40 mpg and sacrifice
performance,” Davis said in an interview yesterday. Mazda3 also
delivers better fuel efficiency without shedding the spare tire
or using a smaller fuel tank to cut weight as rivals have done,
he said.  Mazda plans for the new engine, also being added to its CX-
5 compact crossover due next year, and diesel models that arrive
by 2013 to speed U.S. growth for the brand that trails  Hyundai
Motor Co. (005380) ,  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  and  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) ’s
Subaru in volume. U.S. sales for the Hiroshima, Japan-based
company totaled 229,566 in 2010 and may exceed 250,000 units
this year, based on its pace through September. The company’s
target is 400,000 by mid-decade. Mazda peaked in 1986 at about
339,000.  Hyundai’s Fuel-Efficiency  Hyundai promotes its models as among the market’s most
fuel-efficient, with the Elantra compact, Accent subcompact and
Sonata Hybrid sedan all marketed as achieving 40 mpg in highway
driving. Along with eliminating Elantra’s spare tire to cut
weight, Hyundai uses “low-rolling resistance” tires that have
less grip and create more noise than the standard tires on the
new Mazda3, Davis said.  The Elantra’s 40 highway mpg “is one of its best
attributes,” Miles Johnson, a Hyundai spokesman, said in an
interview. “We’re very pleased with it. We’re selling more 40
mpg models than any other manufacturer.”  Mazda’s “near-term” goal is to lift its market share to
about 2.5 percent, from 2 percent currently, Davis said. That
should mean annual sales of about 400,000 cars and light trucks,
assuming the U.S. market continues to recover over the next few
years, Davis said.  Globally, Mazda continues to work with  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,
previously its biggest shareholder, mainly through joint-venture
plants in the U.S., Thailand and  China , he said.  Mazda plans to stop making Mazda6 sedans at a Flat Rock,
Michigan plant it shares with Ford. Ford intends to invest $555
million to assemble the Fusion midsize sedan at the plant as
part of a tentative labor agreement with the United Auto
Workers, the union has said.  To combat the yen’s rising value relative to the dollar,
Mazda is building a $500 million plant in Salamanca,  Mexico ,
jointly with  Japan ’s Sumitomo Corp. that will supply as many as
140,000 small cars a year for sale in North America.  Mazda rose 4.5 percent to 163 yen yesterday in  Tokyo . The
shares have fallen 30 percent this year. The company’s U.S. unit
is based in Irvine, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
