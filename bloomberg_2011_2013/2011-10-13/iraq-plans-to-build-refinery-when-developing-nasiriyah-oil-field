Iraq will ask companies to build an
oil refinery when it invites bids to develop the Nasiriyah field
south of  Baghdad , an Oil Ministry official said.  “We will not develop the Nasiriyah oil field on its own
but in tandem with the establishment of a refinery,” Abdul-
Mahdi al-Ameedi, the head of the ministry’s licensing
department, said in an interview in Baghdad today. The refinery
will have a capacity of 300,000 barrels a day, he said.  The ministry hasn’t specified a date for the tender and
isn’t in negotiations on the plan, al-Ameedi said. It has
informed foreign companies including  Eni SpA (ENI) , Nippon Oil Corp.
and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  about the project, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
