The euro fell from a five-week high
against the yen before European Commission President  Jose Barroso  speaks in Brussels after calling yesterday for a
“coordinated approach” to recapitalizing the region’s banks.  The yen strengthened against 13 of its 16 major
counterparts on speculation Japanese exporters bought the
currency and data showed China’s export growth slowed in
September, spurring concern the global economy is cooling.
 Australia ’s dollar rose for a second day after a government
report showed the jobless rate fell.  The euro weakened 0.3 percent to 106.22 yen at 7:56 a.m.
London time, after rising to 107.05 yen yesterday, the highest
since Sept. 9. The shared currency fell 0.1 percent to $1.3778.
The dollar declined 0.2 percent to 77.09 yen, after appreciating
to 77.49 yesterday, the strongest since Sept. 12.  China ’s yuan fell 0.3 percent to 6.3777 per dollar after
the customs bureau said exports climbed a less than forecast
17.1 percent from a year earlier and the  trade surplus  shrank.  The People’s Bank of China set its daily reference rate 0.2
percent lower at 6.3737, the biggest decline since November last
year. The currency is allowed to fluctuate a maximum 0.5 percent
on either side of the fixing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
