The lira gained in Istanbul trading
after the government increased special consumption taxes on cars
and other goods amid efforts to narrow the record current
account deficit and slow a booming economy.  The lira climbed 0.1 percent to 1.82 per dollar at 8:26
a.m., extending the lowest level in three weeks.  The special consumption tax rate for non-electric
passenger cars with engines larger than 1.6 liters was increased
to levels ranging from 15 percent to 130 percent, up from 10
percent to 84 percent, according to a decision in the Official
Gazette today. Taxes on tobacco, alcohol and mobile phones was
also raised, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
