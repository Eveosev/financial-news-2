ICE Futures U.S. has proposed that
individual members pay a fee of $3,000 for the first half of
2012 to use the New York options-trading floor for contracts
including sugar and coffee.  “Over the past several years, the trading-floor population
has declined significantly with the growth of electronic
trading,” ICE said in a  letter  dated yesterday to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission. “As electronic trading of exchange
options contracts continues to increase in both absolute terms
and as a share of total options volume, we anticipate a further
decline in the number of brokers and locals on the trading
floor,” ICE said in the letter, which was posted on its
website.  ICE is part of Atlanta-based  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) 
Options for sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton and orange juice change
hands in New York via open outcry in a trading pit. Futures pits
were shut in early 2008, and those contracts trade only
electronically.  The exchange proposed rebates, linked to trading volume,
for as much as the full access fee. The cost for the second half
of 2012 will be determined at least 60 days prior to the start
of the period, according to the letter.  The access fee is “appropriate to the needs of the
exchange and is not unreasonable from the perspective of floor-
based locals and brokers,” ICE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
