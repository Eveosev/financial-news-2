Juhayna Food Industries (JUFO) ,  Egypt ’s
biggest producer of packaged milk, filed further documents with
Egypt’s antitrust commission in response to allegations that it
doesn’t pay farmers a fair price for milk because of its size,
 Al Alam Al Youm  reported.  The company has reached agreement with farmers to tie the
price it pays for milk to that which farmers pay for fodder, the
newspaper cited Sameh El Hudeibi, the deputy financial manager,
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
