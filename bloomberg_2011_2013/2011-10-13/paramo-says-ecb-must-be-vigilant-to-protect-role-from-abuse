European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said the central bank
must be mindful that its role as lender of last is not abused.  “The central bank must remain vigilant in order to ensure
that its enhanced intermediation role during crisis times is not
abused by fiscal authorities and market participants,”
Gonzalez-Paramo said according to the text of a speech delivered
in  Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia, today. “It remains essential that
they strictly fulfill their own responsibilities.”  The ECB stepped up its crisis response last week by
reintroducing one-year loans to banks, restarting a covered
bonds program and offering unlimited cash provisions up to three
months through the first half of 2012. Officials resisted
pressure to cut  interest rates  and instead focused on keeping
banks afloat until  Europe ’s leaders find a solution to the debt
crisis that has roiled financial markets.  “It is essential that prudent fiscal and economic policies
are employed in all euro-area countries,” Gonzalez-Paramo said.
This would “reduce banks’ current overreliance on central bank
funding and facilitate the ECB’s task of delivering  price
stability .”  Gonzalez-Paramo reiterated that the ECB’s crisis measures
are “temporary” and that “maintaining measures which have
outlived their usefulness for too long could trigger other types
of imbalances which could contribute to a new crisis in the
future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
