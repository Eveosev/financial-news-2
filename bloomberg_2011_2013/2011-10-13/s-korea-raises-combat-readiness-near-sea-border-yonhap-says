South Korea ’s military increased
combat readiness after spotting unusual military movement by
North Korean forces along the western sea border, Yonhap News
said, citing a South Korean government official it didn’t
identify.  South Korea recently detected the relocation of a North
Korean ground-to-air missile to the north of Baengnyeong Island
near its disputed western sea border, according to Yonhap.  North
Korea  also moved the missile’s mobile launch pad to a base near
the sea border and recently fired several missiles off the coast,
it said.  In response, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff
strengthened monitoring along the border and raised the level of
preparedness of the army, navy and air force, Yonhap said.  President  Lee Myung Bak  ordered South Korean forces to be
vigilant while he is in the U.S. for meetings with President
Barack Obama, Yonhap said. Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin is also
in the U.S., according to the report.  South Korea and North Korea remain technically at war after
their 1950-1953 conflict ended in a cease-fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
