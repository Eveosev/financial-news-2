European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jozef Makuch said the 17-member euro-region
economy may fail to grow if downside risks materialize.  Negative growth rates of gross domestic product can’t be
ruled out, Makuch told reporters in Bratislava today. “At this
point, I don’t expect GDP to turn negative unless downside risks
materialize.”  Makuch, who is governor of  Slovakia ’s central bank, said
it’s not up to the ECB to recapitalize euro-area banks if
needed. “At first, it’s up to markets, and then governments,”
he said. “It isn’t the ECB’s task.”  Referring to the ECB’s program of purchasing sovereign debt
of distressed euro-area countries, Makuch said he sees no reason
for the Frankfurt-based central bank to maintain the plan after
upgrades to  Europe ’s bailout fund have taken effect.  To contact the reporters on this story:
