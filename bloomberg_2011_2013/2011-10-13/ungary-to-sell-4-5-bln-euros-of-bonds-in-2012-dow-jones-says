Hungary plans to sell 4.5 billion
euros ($6.2 billion) of foreign debt and raise 900 billion
forint ($4.3 billion) from local-currency bonds next year, Dow
Jones Newswires reported, citing Gyula Pleschinger, the chief
executive officer of the state debt management agency.  Hungary seeks to draw new investors, such as Russia, China
and Arab countries, to its bond market, Pleschinger said, adding
that Saudi Arabia is unlikely to “directly subscribe” to local
debt, Dow Jones reported.  The debt agency is in talks with three or four banks,
including  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , which may enter Hungary’s debt
market as primary dealers, augmenting the current 15,
Pleschinger told the  news agency .  To contact the reporter on this story:
