The  Texas Rangers  moved within one
win of advancing to the  World Series  by defeating the Detroit
Tigers 7-3 in 11 innings today to take a three-games-to-one lead
in the American League Championship Series.  Mike Napoli’s run-scoring single off Detroit reliever Jose
Valverde broke a 3-3 tie in the 11th, and Nelson Cruz followed
with a three-run homer. Cruz, who ended Game 2 with a grand slam
in the 11th inning for another Texas 7-3 win, has four home runs
in the series.  Game 5 is set for tomorrow in Detroit, weather permitting,
in the best-of-seven series. The forecast is for rain. Today’s
game started more than two hours late because of a rain delay.  In the National League, the  St. Louis Cardinals  are hosting
the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 3 of their championship series,
which is tied at one game apiece.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
