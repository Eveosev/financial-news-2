Slovakia is moving toward ratifying
the euro rescue fund, making it unlikely that the issue will
overshadow an Oct. 23 crisis summit, European Commission
President  Jose Barroso  said.  “I’m told, the latest report we have received from
Slovakia, is that there is a consensus, a majority in favor of a
solution, so I welcome that,” Barroso said at a press
conference in Brussels today with Danish Prime Minister Helle
Thorning-Schmidt.  Barroso said he was “disappointed” by Slovakia’s failure
to ratify the reinforced European Financial Stability Facility
in an initial vote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
