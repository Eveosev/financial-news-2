International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA is “actively interested” in Portuguese airline TAP
SGPS SA and BMI, a unit of  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , IAG CEO  Willie
Walsh  said in an interview in Dublin today.  TAP and BMI are the “only two we’re actively interested at
this stage,” Walsh said. He also said IAG is “always
interested” in Heathrow slots.  “The smaller airlines are going to find it increasingly
difficult as consolidation takes place,” Walsh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
