Spain , with support from Germany and
 France , is pressing the European Commission not to impose
tougher stress tests on European banks, El Pais reported, citing
Spanish officials without naming them.  As many as 14 Spanish lenders would fail a test under new
criteria the European Banking Authority is proposing which
require a 7 percent tier 1 capital ratio with the European
economy in recession and the value of sovereign debt holdings
written down, the newspaper reported.  The EBA may even boost the capital requirement to 9
percent, El Pais added. That would see the majority of Spainâ€™s
banks failed, it said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
