Italy sold 6.18 billion euros ($8.5
billion) of bonds, near the maximum for the sale, as borrowing
costs fell and demand rose amid  European Central Bank  support
for the nation’s debt.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 3.5 billion euros of bonds due
in 2016 to yield 5.32 percent, compared with a yield of 5.6
percent at the last auction of similar securities on Sept. 13.
Demand was 1.34 times the amount sold, compared with 1.28 times
at the last sale. The amount sold matched the maximum target for
the benchmark 5-year bond.  The government won final approval last month for 54 billion
euros in deficit-cutting measures that convinced the European
Central Bank to buy Italian bonds. The purchases have helped
stem borrowing costs that surged to euro-era records on concern
that Italy may become the next victim of  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The Italian auction went well,” Giuseppe Maraffino, a
fixed-income strategist at  Barclays Capital  in  London , said by
phone. “The market is starting to believe that Europe is
moving, that we will see concrete measures announced, with a
reform of the rescue fund and a recapitalization of banks.”  The Treasury also auctioned 588 million euros of 2018 bonds
to yield 5.62 percent, and 1.16 billion euros of 2021 bonds to
yield 5.77 percent. Also sold were 939 million euros of 2025
bonds to yield 6.34.  Bonds Slide  The auction failed to reverse a slide in Italian bonds,
with the yield on the 10-year benchmark gaining 7 basis points
to 5.83 percent, the highest since the ECB began its bond buying
on Aug. 8. The ECB bought Italian debt today after the auction,
according to two people with knowledge of the transactions. A
spokeswoman for the ECB declined to comment when contacted by
telephone today.  Italian bonds have failed to hold onto the initial gains
triggered by the ECB backstop partly due to political turmoil in
 Italy  that has threatened the survival of the Prime Minister
 Silvio Berlusconi ’s government and implementation of the
austerity measures.  The premier was forced to defend his administration in a
speech in Parliament today after failing to muster a majority on
a routine vote this week. Berlusconi called for a confidence
vote tomorrow to demonstrate that he still has the support to
govern. His term ends in 2013.  The extra yield investors demand to buy Italian 10-year
bonds instead of comparable German bunds widened 12 basis points
to 367 basis points as of 1:14 p.m. in Rome. That spread reached
a euro-era high of 416 basis points on Aug. 5, before the ECB
started its bond purchases.  Today’s auction comes before the country pays back 15.5
billion euros of floating-rate bonds due on Nov. 1, Italy’s
final bond redemption in 2011. Italy sold 9.5 billion euros in
Treasury bills on Oct. 11 in an auction that also saw borrowing
costs fall and demand rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
