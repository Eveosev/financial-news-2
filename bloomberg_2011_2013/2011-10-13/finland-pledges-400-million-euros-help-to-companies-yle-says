Finland’s government pledged about
400 million euros ($548 million) worth of measures in 2012 to
help companies after labor unions and employer organizations
agreed on 4.3 percent wage increases over two years, state-owned
broadcaster YLE reported on its website.  The government will spend about 100 million euros in
cutting the corporate  tax rate  by 0.5 percentage points and fund
temporary layoffs by about 160 million euros, as well as take
other measures, Helsinki-based YLE said. Prime Minister  Jyrki
Katainen ’s cabinet will assess on Nov. 25 if the deal spanning
most industries is comprehensive enough to merit the help, the
broadcaster said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
