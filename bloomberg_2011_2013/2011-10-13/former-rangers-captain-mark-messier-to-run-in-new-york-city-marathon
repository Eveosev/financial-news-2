Mark Messier, who was the captain of
the New York Rangers 1994 National Hockey League championship
team, will run in the New York Marathon on Nov. 6, organizers
said in a statement.  Messier, 50, is running in support of the Tomorrows
Children Fund, which helps children with cancer and serious
blood disorders, and Answer the Call, which benefits city police
and fire department widows and children.  Messier played for the Rangers from 1991-97 and again from
2000-04.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
