Ireland has no objection to
accelerating the introduction of the European Stability
Mechanism, the region’s permanent rescue fund, Prime Minister
 Enda Kenny  said.  “We don’t have any objection to an early introduction” of
the ESM, Kenny told reporters in Brussels today after meeting
with European Commission President  Jose Barroso . Referring to
the current bailout fund, Kenny said that “maximum flexibility
and maximum use of the tools that are there go a long way to
dealing with” the debt crisis.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
