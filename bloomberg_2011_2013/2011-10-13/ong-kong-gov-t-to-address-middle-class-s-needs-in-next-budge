The Hong Kong government will
address the needs of the city’s middle class in the upcoming
budget in February, Chief Executive Donald Tsang said in a
statement today.  “We won’t forget the middle class,” Tsang said.  The government  gave a 75 percent income tax rebate capped
at HK$6,000 in the budget U-turn in March this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
