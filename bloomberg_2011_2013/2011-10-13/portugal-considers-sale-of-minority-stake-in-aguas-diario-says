The  Portuguese government  is
considering the possibility of selling a minority stake in Aguas
de  Portugal  SGPS SA or selling some assets of that state holding
company for the water industry, Diario Economico reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  The sale of all of Aguas de Portugal is not being
considered at the moment due to the difficulty in finding a
buyer in Portugal able to pay a “fair price” for the holding
company, the Portuguese newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
