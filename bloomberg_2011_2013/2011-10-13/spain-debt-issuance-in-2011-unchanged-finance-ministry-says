- The three-month delay till Jan.
31, 2012, of the sale of management contracts for  Madrid  and
Barcelona airports will not affect the calendar for debt
issuance, a spokeswoman, who declined to be named in line with
government policy, said in a telephone interview today.  “Potential revenue from the sale had not been taken into
account in the calendar, which remains unchanged,” she said.  The government aimed to raise at least 3.7 billion euros
from the  management contract  for Madrid Barajas airport and 1.6
billion euros from Barcelona El Prat as it seeked to shrink the
euro-region’s biggest budget deficit after Greece and Ireland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
