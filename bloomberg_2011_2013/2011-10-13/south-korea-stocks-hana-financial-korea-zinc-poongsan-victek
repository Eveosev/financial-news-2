Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  South Korea  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Seoul. The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  rose 0.8 percent to 1,823.10, taking its six-day advance
to 9.4 percent.  Automobile parts makers: Pyeong Hwa Automotive Co. (043370
KS) rallied 3.2 percent to 19,500 won, the highest level since
Aug. 2.  Mando Corp. (060980)  (060980 KS) rose 1 percent to 197,000 won.
The companies gained on speculation their earnings will get a
boost from a free-trade agreement with the U.S.  The Senate approved legislation on a trade deal with South
Korea, the biggest for the U.S. since the North America Free-
Trade Agreement in 1994. Korean parts makers will benefit from
the complete removal of tariffs once the accord takes effect,
 Korea  Investment & Securities Co. said in an Oct. 6 report.  Defense-related shares: Speco Co. (013810 KS), a defense
equipment manufacturer, jumped by the daily limit of 15 percent
to 1,865 won. Victek Co. (065450 KS), which makes electronic
warfare equipment, rallied 8.2 percent to 1,460 won, while
 Huneed Technologies (005870)  (005870 KS), a military communication
equipment manufacturer, gained 4 percent.  The shares gained after Yonhap News reported South Korea’s
military increased combat readiness after spotting unusual
military movement by North Korean forces along the western sea
border. South Korea’s military raised its level of combat
readiness as a result of President Lee Myung Bak’s visit to the
U.S. and not because of any unusual movement from  North Korea , a
Defense Ministry official said.  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790)  (086790 KS) added 7 percent to
38,800 won, the highest level since Aug. 4. The stock gained on
speculation that its purchase of Korea Exchange Bank from  Lone
Star Funds  may be expedited, according to Hong Hun Pio, an
analyst at KTB Investment & Securities Co.  Lone Star Funds declined to appeal a conviction for stock-
price manipulation in Korea, the nation’s financial regulator
said, avoiding another hurdle to gaining approval for its $3.8
billion sale of a stake in Korea Exchange Bank.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930 KS),  Asia ’s biggest maker
of chips, flat screens and mobile phones, fell 0.9 percent to
890,000 won, its first drop since Oct. 4. Samsung lost a bid to
sell its newest tablet computer in  Australia  until after a
patent dispute with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  is settled, a decision that means
the product may not come to market in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
