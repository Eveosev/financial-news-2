India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day on speculation  Europe ’s policy makers will stem the
region’s debt crisis, boosting demand for emerging-market
assets.  The currency headed toward the highest level this month
after European Commission President Jose Barroso yesterday
called for a reinforcement of crisis-hit banks, the payout of a
sixth loan to  Greece  and a faster start for a permanent rescue
fund. Foreign investors bought a net $95 million worth of Indian
equities this week to Oct. 11, the first addition to holdings
since the seven days to Sept. 9. The BSE India Sensitive Index
of shares rose 0.66 percent.  “This is a relief rally after yesterday’s news from
Europe, which could gain strength if the euro gains against the
dollar when European markets open,” said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief
currency trader in Mumbai at state-owned  Corporation Bank . “The
Sensex too is currently supporting the rupee.”  The rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to 48.9250 per dollar as
of 10:08 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 48.8675 on Oct. 10, the highest level
since Sept. 29.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 49.56 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 49.61 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
