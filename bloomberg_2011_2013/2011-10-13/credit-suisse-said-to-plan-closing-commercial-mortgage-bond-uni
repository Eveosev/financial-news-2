Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  plans to shut
its unit for originating commercial mortgages to be packaged
into bonds after price declines eroded profit margins on new
sales, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The bank, which hasn’t offered a deal since sales revived
in 2009, informed about 50 employees yesterday that their jobs
were likely to be eliminated, said the people, who declined to
be identified because the matter isn’t public.  Jack Grone, a spokesman in New York for  Switzerland ’s
second-largest bank, declined to comment. The Wall Street
Journal reported the planned cuts earlier today on its website.  The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries reached the
highest in 20 months last week. Spreads soared to 323 basis
points, or 3.23 percentage points, on Oct. 4, the most since
February 2010, before narrowing to 317 yesterday, according to
Barclays Capital index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
