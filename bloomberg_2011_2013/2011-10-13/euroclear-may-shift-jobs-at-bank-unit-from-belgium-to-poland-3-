Euroclear SA,  Europe â€™s largest
provider of securities settlement, may shift half the jobs at a
division in Belgium to  Poland  because it anticipates difficulty
with recruitment and wants to cut costs.  The company started talks with union representatives at one
Euroclear Bank Operations site in Belgium today about opening an
office in Krakow, Poland, Martin Gregson, a spokesman for
Euroclear in Brussels, said in an interview today.  The Euroclear Bank Operations unit, which processes
transactions including interest payments, has about 1,000
employees in Belgium, Gregson said. Half the jobs may be moved
to Poland, he said. The process may take about five years, and
there are no plans to fire staff or close offices in  Belgium , he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
