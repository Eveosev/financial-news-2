New York  gasoline slipped as
shipments from Europe to the U.S. were set to increase over the
next two weeks.  Twenty-nine tankers were booked or are due to be chartered
for loading in the period, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of five shipbrokers, one owner and two
traders yesterday. Thatâ€™s nine more cargoes than last week,
previous survey data show.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor fell 0.75 cent to 10.5 cents versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery 0.05 cent to $2.8617 a
gallon.  Colonial Pipeline Co. is allocating capacity on its
gasoline Line 1 for Cycle 59 for the segment north of Collins,
 Mississippi , the company said in a notice to shippers.  Colonial operates the largest pipeline linking U.S.  Gulf
Coast  refiners to East Coast markets.  The premium for gasoline in the Gulf Coast dropped 1 cent
to 1 cent a gallon versus futures.  The same fuel in Chicago widened its discount 0.25 cent to
7.75 cents against future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
