Hungary cut its offer of 12-month
Treasury bills at a second consecutive auction as financing
costs jumped to the highest in two years.  The state today sold 30 billion forint ($141 million) of
bills, 10 billion forint less than planned, at an average yield
of 6.22 percent, the highest for that maturity since Oct. 29,
2009, according to data from the Debt Management Agency on
Bloomberg.  Total bids amounted to 50.2 billion forint, compared with
30.2 billion forint two weeks ago, which was the lowest in more
than six years and led the agency to reduce its offer at that
sale by 34 percent.  Hungaryâ€™s currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 292.26 per
euro as of 12:19 p.m. in Budapest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
