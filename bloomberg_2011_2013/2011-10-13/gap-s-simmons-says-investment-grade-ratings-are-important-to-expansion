  Gap Inc. (GPS) ’s investment-grade ratings
at Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings are “very
important” as the retailer expands internationally, Chief
Financial Officer Sabrina Simmons said.  “It is very important to the company,” Simmons said today
in a telephone interview. “As we’re growing globally, it
certainly helps to be recognized as an investment-grade credit
when we’re trying to acquire real estate.”  The retailer, which issued $1.25 billion of debt in April,
is rated Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by Fitch, the lowest
investment-grade level at both firms. The company is graded BB+,
one level below investment grade, by  Standard & Poor’s . San
Francisco-based Gap is “a very strong story” for bondholders
because of its strong free  cash flow , Simmons said.  “We’re quite happy with the debt level we have right now
so we have no current plans to do any further capital raising,”
she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
