  Thailand ’s Hi-Tech Industrial
Estate in Ayutthaya province hasn’t flooded yet, and authorities
are attempting to reinforce a barrier protecting the compound, a
state agency said.  “We are trying to defend it from flooding,” Narapote
Thewtanom, deputy governor of the Industrial Estate Authority of
Thailand, said today by phone. “Still, we have ordered the
evacuation of people inside the compound for their safety. There
are about 100 factories inside the Hi-Tech Industrial Estate.”  The state-run MCOT news agency earlier reported the
facility had been flooded.  The nearby Bang-pa In Industrial Estate has also escaped
flooding so far, Narapote said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
