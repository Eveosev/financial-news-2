     Oct. 13 (Bloomberg)-- Five U.S. House Democrats asked the
 Department of Justice  to open an investigation on whether U.S.
banks and their trade associations colluded on decisions to
charge new fees in the wake of caps on debit-card swipe fees.  “Statements made by individual banks and their trade
associations raise questions about whether some price increases
that have occurred this year have actually been coordinated,”
Representative  Peter Welch , a Vermont Democrat, and four of his
colleagues wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
