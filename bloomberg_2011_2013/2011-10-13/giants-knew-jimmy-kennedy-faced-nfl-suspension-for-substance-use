The  New York Giants  were aware Jimmy Kennedy was facing suspension for violating the  National
Football League ’s policy on performance-enhancing substances
before the defensive tackle was signed, coach  Tom Coughlin  said.  Two days ago, the NFL suspended Kennedy for four games. He
can return to the active roster on Nov. 14.  “We talked about it when he first came here and we were
very much aware of the (appeals) process that took place one day
when he wasn’t available to us three weeks ago,” Coughlin told
reporters yesterday. “That is all I have to say about it.”  Coughlin said he considered not signing Kennedy and then
decided to add him to the team’s roster.  “Jimmy Kennedy, and everything he has done with me, has
conducted himself as a pro,” Coughlin said. “He has done
things in the best interest of the club and I am going to give
him the benefit of the doubt. If it occurred as a one-time
thing, let’s get it over and done with.”  Kennedy, 31, who has four tackles in five games this
season, is in his first season with the Giants after spending
the previous three years with the  Minnesota Vikings .  The NFL, in keeping with its policy, didn’t reveal the
substance Kennedy was suspended for taking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
