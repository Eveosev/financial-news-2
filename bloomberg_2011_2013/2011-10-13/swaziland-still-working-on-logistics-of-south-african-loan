Swaziland is finalizing the
“logistics” of a 2.4 billion rand loan from  South Africa ,
Foreign Affairs Minister Lutfo Dlamini said.  The country hasn’t rejected the bailout, Dlamini said by
phone today from Mbabane, the capital, responding to a report in
the Johannesburg-based Daily Sun newspaper that it would take a
10 billion rand loan from Qatar instead.  South Africa is waiting for Swaziland to sign the loan
agreement, which had conditions, Bulelwa Boqwana, a spokeswoman
for South Africa’s finance ministry, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
