Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist and
activist who was imprisoned for 81 days earlier this year,
topped ArtReview’s annual ranking of the 100 most influential
people in the art world, the Power 100, published today.  The Beijing-based artist -- who last year paved Tate
Modern’s monumental Turbine Hall with 100 million porcelain
sunflower seeds -- “was ranked number one as a result of his
activism as much as his art practice,” London-based ArtReview
said in an e-mailed release, noting that artists no longer
worked in “a privileged zone” defined by galleries or museums.  Every year, timed to coincide with  London ’s  Frieze Art
Fair , Art Review gathers an international panel of art-world
professionals to pick the 100 most influential people in their
field. Last year’s Power 100 topper, international art dealer
 Larry Gagosian , ranked fourth this year.  In second position on this year’s list were Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, co-directors of London’s
 Serpentine Gallery . Obrist came second also last year, and in
2009 he was at the top of the list.  Losing ground were contemporary artists  Damien Hirst  and
 Jeff Koons , whose auction prices have suffered since 2009.
Hirst -- who was No. 1 in 2005 and 2008 -- fell to No. 64 (from
No. 53 last year). Koons slipped to 66 from 47.  By contrast, artist  Gerhard Richter  -- whose retrospective
at London’s Tate Modern just opened -- soared to No. 11 from No.
55.  Other high-scoring museum directors were the  Museum of
Modern Art ’s Glenn D. Lowry, at No. 3, and Tate’s Nicholas Serota, at No. 6.
