Alcatel-Lucent rose the most in more
than eight months in Paris trading after the Financial Times
reported that the telecommunications-equipment manufacturer
agreed to sell its corporate call-center business.  Alcatel-Lucent jumped as much as 11 percent to 2.31 euros,
the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 10, and was up 8.5 percent
as of 12:09 p.m. That propelled the stock to a 3.1 percent
increase this year, valuing the Paris-based company at 5.23
billion euros ($7.18 billion).  The French manufacturer reached an agreement to sell the
call-center division to London-based private-equity firm Permira
Advisers LLP for as much as $1.5 billion, the Financial Times
 reported  today, without saying where it got the information.  Talks between Alcatel and Permira are under way and no
agreement has been reached, a person with knowledge of the
negotiations said, declining to be identified because the
process is private. The companies may fail to reach a deal, the
person said.  Simon Poulter, a spokesman for Alcatel-Lucent, and Noemie de Andia, a Permira spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
