Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC Universal said
it hired Ted Koppel to join “Rock Center with Brian Williams”
as a special correspondent.  Koppel, 71, left  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC News in November
2005 after 42 years. With more than 25 years as leader of ABC’s
“Nightline,” he was the longest-serving news anchor in network
history, according to a statement released today by
Philadelphia-based Comcast’s NBC News.  “It’s an enormous honor to work with this giant and former
competitor,” Williams, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” said
in the statement. “Rock Center with Brian Williams,” a weekly,
hourlong newsmagazine show, premieres Oct. 31.  Koppel has won 41 Emmy Awards, eight George Foster Peabody
Awards, and the 2011 Edward R. Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award
for his work in journalism at ABC News,  National Public Radio
