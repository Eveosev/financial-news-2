Corn fell for a second day in
 Chicago  after the U.S. boosted estimates for local and global
stockpiles, signaling more supplies for makers of food, animal
feed and fuels. Wheat declined.  Corn inventories in the U.S. will be 29 percent larger than
forecast last month as exports slow, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. Global corn reserves were pegged at
123.19 million metric tons, 4.9 percent above a September
forecast. Projections exceeded analysts’ expectations.  “Bigger-than-expected reserves have put pressure on corn
prices,” Lynette Tan, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte, said
by phone from  Singapore . “Prices may gain later boosted by
strong demand.”  Corn for December delivery dropped 7.75 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $6.33 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain has climbed 0.6 percent this
year.  “We expected a bearish response from the USDA report
yesterday,” said Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London. “I wouldn’t read into this too much.”  World corn production in the crop year that began Oct. 1
will be a record 860.09 million tons, up 3.8 percent from a year
earlier, the USDA said. The agency boosted its forecast for
 China ’s crop by 2.2 percent to a record 182 million tons and
said Ukraine will harvest 21 million tons, up 76 percent from
last year.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 1.75 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $6.25 a bushel after sliding the most since Sept. 30
yesterday. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE
Liffe in Paris was unchanged at 185.75 euros ($255.11) a ton.  World inventories of wheat before next year’s Northern
Hemisphere harvests may total 202.37 million tons, the most
since 2002, the USDA said yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 8 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $12.315 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
