Following is a seven-week history
of the fed interest rates paid on reserve balances.  The Federal Reserve banks pay interest on required reserve
balances, balances held to satisfy  reserve requirements  and
on balances held in excess of the required reserve balances.
The Fed Board determines the interest rate paid on both required
and excess reserves. Paying interest on excess reserves is an 
additional tool for the Fed to conduct monetary policy.  SOURCE: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
