Eaton Vance Corp. (EV)  named Stephen W.
Clarke, a former executive at Old Mutual Asset Management, to
head a new unit in charge of developing actively managed
exchange-traded funds.  Clarke, 47, led a group of institutional and alternative
investment affiliates at the money-management unit of London-
based Old Mutual Plc for more than a decade, Boston-based Eaton
Vance said today in a statement. He will be president of the
firm’s Navigate Fund Solutions unit.  Eaton Vance purchased the assets of Managed ETFs LLC, a
developer of actively managed ETFs models, in November. The
assets include patents on proposed ETFs that would operate
without disclosing holdings every day. ETFs currently are
required to reveal most of their holdings daily, an obligation
that has discouraged the development of actively managed ETFs.  BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest money manager, asked
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 1 for
permission to open active ETFs that wouldn’t reveal holdings
daily. Eaton Vance hasn’t filed any similar proposals with the
SEC, according to Colleen Lavery, a company spokeswoman.  ETFs typically track an index and trade throughout the day
on an exchange, like stocks. Active ETFs seek to combine the
skill of a manager selecting investments with the trading
flexibility, lower fees and tax advantages of ETFs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
