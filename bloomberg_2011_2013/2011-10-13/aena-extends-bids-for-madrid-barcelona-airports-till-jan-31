Aena Aeropuertos SA extended the
period to present offers for the Madrid-Barajas and Barcelona-El
Prat airport concessions by three months till January 31, the
company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The deadline was extended because of the difficulties
encountered by potential bidders to raise funds, Aena said. The
conditions for the concessions remain the same, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
