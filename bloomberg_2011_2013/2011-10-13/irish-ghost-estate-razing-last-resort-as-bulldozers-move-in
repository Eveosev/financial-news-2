Demolishing Ireland’s so-called
ghost estates should be a “last resort” for dealing with
partially finished developments across the country, Housing
Minister Willie Penrose said today.  Less than 10 houses in three housing estates were
demolished on safety ground since the last surveyed period,
Penrose told reporters in Dublin today. There is “no magic
wand” to resolve the problem of Ireland’s unfinished
housing estates, he said.  The number of unfinished Irish housing estates declined to
2,066 from 2,876, according to a survey released by the ministry
today. The number of complete and vacant houses stood at 18,638,
according to the report. Some 17,872 houses are at various
stages of construction.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
