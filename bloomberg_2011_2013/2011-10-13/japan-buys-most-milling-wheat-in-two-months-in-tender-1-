Japan  bought 129,163 metric tons of
milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia  in a regular
tender today, the largest volume in two months, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.  Shipment is set from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31, Masafumi Otsuka at
the ministry’s grain-trade division said today by phone. It was
the biggest purchase since Aug. 11, when the government bought
135,846 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 2.73 million tons
through regular tenders this fiscal year, compared with 5.16
million tons in the year ended March 31.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
