Greece ’s money managers saw a
slowdown in the value of net outflows from mutual funds in the
third quarter, the  Hellenic Fund and Asset Management
Association  said.  Outflows from Greek-managed mutual funds fell to 286.9
million euros ($391.8 million) in the third quarter from about
443 million euros in the second quarter, the Athens-based
Association said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Outflows from internationally positioned investment funds
were often less than 1 percent of total assets,” Aris Xenofos,
president of the association and managing director of EFG
Eurobank Mutual Fund Management Co, part of Greece’s second-
largest bank, said in the statement.  The total value of UCITS mutual funds stood at 5.9 billion
euros at the end of September, compared with 7.1 billion euros
at the end of June, according to the statement. UCITS, meaning
Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable
Securities, is a regulated European fund format that allows
managers to invest in derivatives, according to the European
Commission’s website.  The total value of assets managed by the association’s 35
members, including real-estate and closed-end funds, declined to
9.6 billion euros on Sept. 30, from 11.1 billion euros on June
30, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
