Australia ’s upper house Senate
passed legislation today allowing the nation’s financial
companies to sell covered bonds, a move the Treasury estimates
may lead to A$130 billion ($132 billion) of sales.  The legislation, introduced to parliament last month by
Treasurer Wayne Swan, will amend the nation’s Banking Act to
allow domestic lenders to sell the debt for the first time. It
was passed yesterday in the lower house of parliament.  “Covered bonds offer banks access to a more diverse and
larger funding base, the potential for longer tenor issuance and
a prospective reduction in funding costs,” said  David Goodman ,
Sydney-based Westpac Banking Corp.’s director of asset-backed
securities. “If pricing is similar to overseas markets, spreads
on covered bonds may be around a third less than on senior
unsecured debt.”  While offshore banks have been allowed to sell covered
notes in Australia, the ban meant domestic lenders were unable
to access cheaper funding in a nation with the highest  interest
rates  in the developed world. Covered bonds, which typically
have the highest  credit rating , are backed by assets that stay
on the bank’s balance sheet and can be sold in a default.  “All Australian banks,  credit unions  and building
societies, and ultimately their customers, will benefit from the
issuance of covered bonds,” Swan’s office said in an e-mailed
statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
