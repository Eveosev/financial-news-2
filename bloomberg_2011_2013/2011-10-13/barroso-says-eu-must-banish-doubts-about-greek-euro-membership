European leaders must take decisive
steps to banish any doubts about  Greece  staying in the euro
zone, European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said.  Barroso called for “decided action in Greece so that all
doubt is removed about Greece’s membership in the euro area.”  Speaking at a Friends of Europe conference in Brussels,
Barroso repeated yesterday’s appeal for bank recapitalizations
if necessary and rapid adoption of plans to upgrade the euro
area rescue fund.  “If we are to achieve European renewal, we must be clear
about the need for more integration, more discipline and full
implementation of what is agreed,” he said. Europe is at “the
most critical juncture in our union’s history.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
