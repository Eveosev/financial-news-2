Vitol Group bought cargoes of jet
fuel in northwest  Europe  at lower prices than trades yesterday.
Diesel’s premium to gasoil rose.  Gasoil’s backwardation, or the premium paid for near-term
contracts over later delivery dates, widened as stockpiles
plunged to a three-year low. The heating fuel’s crack, or
premium to  Brent crude , increased.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded from $957 to $975 a metric ton, according to a
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with trades from $956 to $971 yesterday.  Gasoline’s premium to Brent increased to $4.98 a barrel
from $4.64 yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
crude and refined products broker in London.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent narrowed to $6.21 a barrel from
$6.91 yesterday, according to PVM.  Middle Distillates  Morgan Stanley sold the jet fuel cargoes at premiums of $72
and $73 a ton to November gasoil, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window which
ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. That compares with trades
yesterday at $76 more than the gasoil contract.  Gasoil for November rose 0.4 percent to $922 a ton as of
4:45 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The contract for December fell 0.8 percent to $911.25 a ton.
That widened the backwardation to $10.75, the most since the
later-dated contract became cheaper than near-term delivery in
early August. A backwardated market may mean a current shortage
of supply.  Stockpiles of the heating fuel in northwest Europe dropped
8.1 percent to 2.053 million tons in the week to today,
according to PJK International BV, a consultant in the
Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since December 2008.  The fuel’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
widened to $13.72 a barrel from $11.47 yesterday, according to
ICE data. Front-month Brent declined 1.3 percent to $109.95 a
barrel on the ICE exchange.  A gasoil cargo traded at a premium of $25 a ton to November
futures, according to the survey of Platts. Vitol sold to
Litasco, OAO Lukoil’s trading unit.  Diesel barges traded at premiums of $55 and $57 a ton to
November gasoil, according to the survey. That compares with a
trade yesterday at a $52 premium.  Litasco bought a diesel cargo from Gunvor Group Ltd. at a
$55 a ton premium to November gasoil, the survey showed.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges changed hands from $627 to $635
a ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with trades
yesterday from $635.75 to $642 a ton.  Refineries  Repsol YPF SA’s Petronor refinery in  Spain  said it will
carry out a “sequential” halt of its production units after
workers called a strike.  Petronor workers will hold a strike from Oct. 14 to Oct.
18, the company said in a statement on its website. The 220,000-
barrel-a-day refinery is located near Bilbao in northern Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
