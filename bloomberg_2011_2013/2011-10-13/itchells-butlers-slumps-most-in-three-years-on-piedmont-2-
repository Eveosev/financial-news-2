Mitchells & Butlers Plc (MAB) , the owner
of the All Bar One chain, fell the most since May 2009 in London
trading after Piedmont Inc. said it won’t proceed with an
indicative offer.  Mitchells & Butlers shares declined 17.4 pence, or 6.9
percent, to 235.10 pence, the most since May 21, 2009 at the
4:30 p.m. close. The stock has fallen 33 percent this year.  Piedmont, the investment vehicle owned by Bahamas-based
billionaire investor  Joe Lewis , is Mitchells & Butlers’ second-
largest shareholder, owning 23 percent of the company. It was
mulling a potential offer of 230 pence a share, Piedmont said
Sept. 12. Today the company said it had decided not to go ahead.  “Since we made our proposal economic conditions have
deteriorated, market volatility has increased and M&B’s trading
statement suggested further weakness,” Piedmont spokesman
George Hudson said in an e-mailed statement. “The fundamental
valuation and outlook is now more uncertain and clearly there is
increased risk around the business. As a result we have decided
not to make an offer for the business.”  Mitchells & Butlers will continue to focus on its growth
strategy, the Birmingham, central England-based company said in
a separate statement. Piedmont’s indicative offer would
“substantially undervalue” the company in the view of its
independent directors, it said.  Piedmont’s possible offer was described at the time as
“insulting” to other shareholders by Standard Life
Investments, an investor in Mitchells & Butlers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
