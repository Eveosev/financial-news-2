European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  urged some countries to cut taxes or boost spending to
stimulate the economy.  “Some countries have room for fiscal stimulus and they
should use it, but most of our member states don’t,” Barroso
said at a Friends of Europe conference in Brussels today. He
didn’t name the countries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
