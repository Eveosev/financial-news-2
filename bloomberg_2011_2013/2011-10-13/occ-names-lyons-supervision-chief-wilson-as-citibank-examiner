The Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency has named John C. Lyons Jr. as its senior deputy
comptroller for bank supervision policy and chief national bank
examiner, meaning he will essentially switch jobs with David K.
Wilson, who was named examiner-in-charge of Citibank.  The OCC announced the changes in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
