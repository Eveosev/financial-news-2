U.S. cities and states will ask
voters for $5.41 billion of new bonding authority on Nov. 8,
according to data from Ipreo.  Arkansas , which is seeking authority for $575 million for
highway construction, leads issuers on Ipreo’s list, followed by
San Mateo Community College in  California  and San Francisco’s
public school district, according to data from New York-based
Ipreo, which provides capital-market data and analytical
services.  The total will grow next week because Ipreo said it plans
to add a Texas authorization for $6 billion of bonds to make
loans to local units of government for water projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
