Refined copper inventories in  China 
climbed to a record 1.9 million metric tons, or about three
months of consumption, by the end of last year, as buying picked
up after a slump in prices.  The stockpiles included 131,891 tons in Shanghai Futures
Exchange-monitored warehouses, bonded warehouses, China’s state
reserves, and metal held by producers, consumers and trading
firms, said Bian Gang, deputy director of the China Nonferrous
Metals Industry Association’s International Coordination
Department.  China, the biggest producer and consumer of the refined
metal, rarely discloses the estimates of state reserves and
commercial inventories. The State Reserve Bureau reportedly
bought copper in 2009 after prices slumped to under $3,000 a ton
amid the worst global recession since the Great Depression.  “Most of the inventories should belong to state reserves,
and they won’t be easily released onto the market,” said Cai
Luoyi, head of research department at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co.
“The reserves may be a result of stockpiling after the price
tumbled in 2008.”  China International Capital Corp., China’s largest
investment bank, Macquarie Group Ltd. and BOC International Co.
in early 2009 suggested the state reserve may take advantage of
the slump in copper prices to build up holdings. The reserve
bureau may raise purchases to 1 million tons from 600,000 tons,
according to CICC in a March 2009 report.  Price Sinks  Copper, which reached a record $10,190 on the London Metal
Exchange in February, sank to $6,635 on Oct. 3, a more than 14-
month low. The contract traded at $7,375 by 2:45 p.m. Shanghai
time, taking this year’s decline to 24 percent.  Total demand in China last year was 6.8 million tons,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Copper
imports by China climbed to the highest level in 16 months in
September as lower prices lured traders to place orders and
after domestic stockpiles fell.  Prices may be supported by Chinese buying as imports pick
up in coming months after destocking earlier this year and
limited mine supply, Macquarie said in a Sept. 26 report.  It was estimated that about 300,000 tons of refined metal
had been destocked from January to July this year and an
additional 200,000 tons of metal contained in copper
concentrates and scrap had also been cleared out from warehouses
at smelters, traders and consumers, the report said.  Inventories of users and trading firms may be extremely
low, CIFCO’s Cai said. Still, no one is stockpiling now because
of the tight credit situation and purchasing will only be done
on a “hand-to-mouth” basis, Cai said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
