Foreclosure filings in the U.S.
declined 34 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier as
lenders reviewed paperwork related to delinquent loans and home
seizures, according to  RealtyTrac Inc .  A total of 610,337 properties received notices of default,
auction or repossession, down from 930,437 a year earlier and up
from 608,235 in the second quarter, the Irvine, California-based
data seller said today in a report. One in every 213 U.S.
households got a filing.  Banks slowed foreclosure actions a year ago after
allegations of “robo-signing,” or pushing through unverified
default documents, surfaced nationwide. The claims spurred a
probe by state attorneys general and ongoing settlement talks
with lenders. The delays have resulted in 12 straight months of
year-over-year filing declines, with September down 38 percent.  “We’ve been on a giant play-pause button for a year, but a
lot of thoroughness occurred once the problems were
identified,” James J. Saccacio, RealtyTrac’s chief executive
officer, said in a telephone interview. “We might begin to see
things unclog.”  Default notices rose 14 percent from the second quarter to
195,878, a sign lenders may be speeding up the repossession
process, Saccacio said. States with the biggest quarterly jumps
in default filings included  Massachusetts , up 65 percent;  New
Jersey , up 29 percent; Florida, up 24 percent; and California
and Ohio, both up 21 percent, according to RealtyTrac.  Home Repossessions Decline  Lenders seized 196,530 properties in the third quarter,
down 4 percent from the previous three months and 32 percent
from a year earlier. On a quarterly basis, repossessions rose 62
percent in Massachusetts, 47 percent in  Oregon , 42 percent in
Georgia and 27 percent in Illinois.  Nevada had the nation’s highest per-household rate of
foreclosure filings at one in 44, followed by California at one
in 88 and Arizona at one in 93. Georgia, Florida, Utah,
 Michigan , Idaho, Illinois and Colorado rounded out the top 10.  California , the most populous state, had the most total
filings at 153,051, or one of four in the U.S. Florida was
second at 67,886 and Georgia third at 33,637. Illinois,
Michigan, Arizona,  Texas , Nevada, Ohio and Colorado also ranked
in the top 10.  RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the U.S. population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
