Shareholders of  Telekomunikacja
Polska SA (TPS)  approved today a management plan for  Poland ’s largest
phone company to buy back shares for as much as 800 million
zloty ($255 million).  The France Telecom SA unit known as TPSA has a mandate to
purchase as much as 10 percent of its shares through the end of
2012. Earlier this year TPSA sold TP Emitel Sp. z o.o., an
operator of television and radio towers, for 1.7 billion zloty,
saying in July it would allocate about the half of the proceeds
to the buyback.  The operator of the Orange brand in Poland is fighting
court battles against GN Store Nord A/S after an arbitration
tribunal last year ordered TPSA to pay about 2.9 billion kroner
($535 million) to DPTG I/S of Denmark, a GN unit.  Konrad Grotowski, a lawyer from Wardynski & Partners, which
represents GN, protested the buyback resolution at today’s
meeting, saying TPSA should use the free cash to pay DPTG.
Grotowski declined to comment on whether GN Nord will challenge
the resolution in a Polish court.  Telekomunikacja “doesn’t see a real threat to the
execution of the buyback program” from GN’s protest, Wojciech
Jabczynski, a spokesman, told reporters in Warsaw today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
