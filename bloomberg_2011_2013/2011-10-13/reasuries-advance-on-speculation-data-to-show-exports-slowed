Treasuries rose, with 30-year bonds
ending the longest losing streak in four years, as stocks fell
and a Chinese report showing export growth at the weakest in
seven months added to signs global economic growth is waning.  Benchmark 10-year note yields fell from almost a six-week
high as the  European Central Bank  said the involvement of
private-sector banks in euro-area bailouts through enforced
investor losses would risk financial stability. Minutes of the
 Federal Reserve ’s September meeting released yesterday showed
some officials wanted to keep more bond buying as an option. The
U.S. is scheduled to auction $13 billion of 30-year bonds today.  “Treasuries remain generally well-supported due to the
uncertain outlook and central-bank activity,” said  Kornelius Purps , a strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “It’s a bit
stunning that the Treasury market has been suffering in the past
couple of weeks. It’s probably not the advance today which is
surprising but rather the sell-off” that preceded it, he said.  Yields on 30-year bonds fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.17 percent at 7:16 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
securities maturing August 2041 gained 1/2, or $5 per $1,000
face amount, to 111 2/32.  The 10-year note yields dropped three basis points to 2.19
percent after rising yesterday to 2.27 percent, the highest
level since Sept. 1.  ‘Significant Stress’  While private-sector involvement “is certain to place
significant stress on the solvency of banks and other private
financial institutions in the country concerned, it will also
have an impact on the balance sheets of banks in other euro-area
countries,” the ECB said in its monthly bulletin today.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell 0.9 percent, and futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in December dropped 0.1
percent. The euro depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.3726.  Treasuries have returned 5 percent since the end of June, a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows. German bunds,
perceived to be Europe’s safest government debt securities, have
risen 6.2 percent, and Italian securities have lost 4.6 percent.  China ’s exports climbed a less-than-forecast 17.1 percent
in September from a year earlier, the customs bureau said in
Beijing. The  trade surplus  fell to $14.51 billion, the smallest
since May.  The  U.S. trade deficit  widened 2.2 percent in August to
$45.8 billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey before the
Commerce Department’s report today.  Fed Minutes  Fed officials saw “considerable uncertainty” that U.S.
economic growth will pick up, the central bank said in the
minutes of its Sept. 20-21 meeting. Policy makers decided at the
gathering to replace $400 billion of Treasuries in the bank’s
portfolio with longer-term debt to reduce borrowing costs.  The central bank plans to buy $4.25 billion to $5 billion
of Treasuries maturing from October 2017 to August 2019 today as
part of the program, according to its  website .  “Treasury yields will fall again,” said Masazumi Fukuoka,
a senior dealer at the Singapore branch of Mitsubishi Trust &
Banking Corp., a unit of  Japan ’s largest publicly traded lender.
“I don’t believe there’s recovery in the economy, and there’s
still concern over Europe.”  The 30-year U.S. bonds being sold today yielded 3.17
percent in pre-auction trading, versus a record low 3.31 percent
at the last sale of the securities Sept. 14.  Buyers submitted orders for 2.85 times the amount of debt
offered last month, the most since March. Indirect bidders, the
group that includes foreign central banks, bought 39.4 percent
of the securities, the highest level since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
