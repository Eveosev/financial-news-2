Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
won European approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of
 Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) , the final regulatory hurdle for the deal, after
agreeing to divest the right to sell a generic drug in  France .  The companies plan to close the deal tomorrow, Teva and
Cephalon said today in a statement.  As a condition of European Commission approval, Petach
Tikva, Israel-based Teva must divest Cephalon’s marketing rights
in France for a generic version of the $1.1 billion narcolepsy
drug Provigil. Teva also agreed to grant the purchaser “certain
additional rights with respect to the entire European Economic
Area, including a covenant not to sue,” the companies said.  U.S. regulators approved Teva’s purchase of Frazer,
Pennsylvania-based Cephalon last week after Teva agreed to let
Par Pharmaceutical Cos. market modafinil, the generic form of
Provigil, for a year. The Federal Trade Commission also required
Teva to sell Par its rights to generic versions of a fentanyl
lozenge for cancer pain and an extended release form of the
muscle relaxant Flexeril.  To contact the reporter on this story:
