Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest
U.S. discount retailer, said online president Steve Eastman has
left the company, one month after the retailer’s website crashed
from overwhelming demand for new designer apparel.  Eastman, 47, left the company to “pursue other
opportunities,” the company said today in a statement. Target
did not name a replacement in the press release.  The Target.com executive’s departure comes two months after
the retailer took control of its e-commerce site from  Amazon.com
Inc. (AMZN)  The day the revamped site went live, links such as “learn
all about what’s new” didn’t work. On Sept. 13, the online
store crashed when demand for products from the Italian fashion
house Missoni exceeded expectations.  Eastman joined Minneapolis-based Target in 1982 and was
named head of the online unit in 2008, Amy Reilly, a company
spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview.  Target generates about 2 percent of its $67.4 billion
revenue online.  The retailer’s shares fell 0.04 percent to close at $52.73
in  New York . The shares have declined 12 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
