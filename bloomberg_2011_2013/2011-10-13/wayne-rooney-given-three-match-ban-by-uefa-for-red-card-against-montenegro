Wayne Rooney  will be banned for all
England’s group matches at next year’s European Championship
after receiving a three-match suspension following his red card
against Montenegro on Oct. 7.  The 25-year-old Manchester United player will miss “his
country’s next three UEFA national competition matches for which
he would be eligible,” European soccer’s governing body  said in
a statement  today.  Rooney was dismissed after kicking out at Miodrag Dzudovic
during the 2-2 draw in Podgorica, Montenegro. England coach
Fabio Capello called it a “silly mistake.”  England’s Football Association said it will “await the
full reasons” behind UEFA’s decision before deciding whether to
appeal, or make any further public comment. An appeal must be
lodged within three days of receipt of the full ruling.  Rooney has scored 28 goals for England, more than any
player in its most recent squad.  Jermain Defoe , Darren Bent,
Ashley Young and Rooney all scored three goals for England in
Euro 2012 qualifying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
