Iran  is facing a projected loss of
$14 billion a year in oil revenue as a result of economic
sanctions, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.  “Iran has been increasingly unable to attract foreign
investment, especially in its oil fields, leading to a projected
loss of $14 billion a year in oil revenues through 2016,” David Cohen, the Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence, said in prepared testimony before the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee.  The number and quality of foreign banks willing to transact
with designated Iranian financial institutions has “dropped
precipitously” over the last year, Cohen said.  “Iran’s
shrinking access to financial services and trade finance has
made it extremely difficult for Iran to pay for imports and
receive payment for exports.”  Several energy traders, such as Russia’s OAO Lukoil,
India’s  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the Netherland’s  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) , and Turkey’s  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) ,
have stopped sales of refined petroleum products to Iran,
according to Wendy Sherman, undersecretary of State for
political affairs.  “Iran has had to redirect production facilities from
valuable petrochemical export production in order to manufacture
refined petroleum for domestic sale,” Sherman said in prepared
testimony.  Still, Iran sells its oil to Spain, Turkey, Japan,  South
Korea , China and India, according to Treasury’s Cohen. Those
countries buy between 7 percent and 15 percent of their oil from
Iran, Cohen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
