Djibouti plans to spend $19.6
million over the next two years exploring for geothermal-power
sources as the Horn of Africa nation seeks to address an
electricity shortage, Energy Minister Ahmed Fouad Ay said.  The project will be funded by the  Global Environment
Facility , an independent organization that provides grants to
 developing countries , as well as the  World Bank  and the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Ay told reporters
yesterday in Djibouti City, the capital. Drilling is expected to
be completed by 2013, while the country intends to develop a 56-
megawatt geothermal power plant by 2018, he said.  “The commissioning of a geothermal power-plant will help
Djibouti switch to green energy in less than a decade,” Finance
Minister Ilyas Dawaleh Moussa said at the briefing.  Djibouti, which hosts about 2,500 U.S. military personnel
at the Camp Lemonnier military base, has a $982 million economy
with fewer than 1 million people. The country relies on oil
imports to produce all of its electricity. While Djibouti has
the capacity to generate 98.8 megawatts, ageing infrastructure
has reduced effective production to 57 megawatts, according to
the  African Development Bank ’s website.  Peak power demand in Djibouti is about 75 megawatts and
this figure may increase to 138 megawatts by 2015 and 219
megawatts by 2035, according to the bank. The electricity
network covers only 50 percent of the country, it said.  Djibouti began importing power from neighboring  Ethiopia  in
May after the construction of a transmission line connecting the
two countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
