 Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
asked the Parliament to confirm its confidence in his government
after Italy’s president called on him to prove
he can still govern after losing a routine legislative vote.
Berlusconi spoke today at the Chamber of Deputies.  Berlusconi said there’s no alternative to his government
without general elections. He also said the Parliament will vote
again today on the 2010 budget report after it failed to approve
it Oct. 11.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
