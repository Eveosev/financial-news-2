The  European Central Bank  bought
Italian government bonds, according to three people with
knowledge of the transactions.  The Franfurt-based central bank started buying the Italian
securities after the nation completed auctions of government
bonds today, said two of the people, who asked not to be
identified because the trades are confidential.  A spokeswoman for the ECB declined to comment when
contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
