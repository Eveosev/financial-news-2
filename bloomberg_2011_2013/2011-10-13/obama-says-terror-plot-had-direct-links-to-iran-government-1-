President  Barack Obama  said a person
charged with plotting to assassinate Saudi Arabia’s U.S.
ambassador “had direct links, was paid by” and “directed by
individuals in the Iranian government.”  “This is part of a pattern of dangerous and reckless
behavior by the Iranian government,” Obama said at a joint
White House news conference with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, who is on a state visit to  Washington .  “There are individuals in the Iranian government who were
aware of this plot,” Obama said.  Asked if there is evidence Iran’s top leaders knew about
the plan, Obama said that “even if at the highest levels there
was not detailed operational knowledge, there has to be
accountability with respect to anybody in the Iranian government
engaging in this kind of activity.”  The U.S. will “apply the toughest sanctions and continue
to mobilize the international community” to “make sure that
 Iran  is further isolated,” Obama said.  The U.S. hasn’t taken “any options off the table,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
