Air France SA today flew an Airbus
A321 passenger aircraft from Toulouse to Paris’s Orly airport
with a fuel mix comprising 50 percent used cooking oil.  The 80-minute, 354-mile (570-kilometer) journey was the
world’s greenest commercial flight, Toulouse, France-based
Airbus said today in an e-mailed statement.  Besides using biofuel, the plane, which can carry more than
200 passengers, flew the shortest available route using a more-
efficient continuous descent approach, Airbus said. That helped
cut in half the overall emissions of carbon dioxide, according
to the statement.  Airlines on July 1 won approval from ASTM International,
the U.S. technical standards body, to fly passenger planes using
fuel made from inedible plants and organic waste mixed with
petroleum-derived fuel. Approval allows for blends of up to 50
percent biofuel. Since then, airlines including Deutsche
Lufthansa AG and Finnair Oyj have flown using such blends.  More efficient air traffic management could result in a
decrease of 10 percent in aircraft fuel consumption, according
to the statement, as well as “significant” reductions in CO2
and noise emissions.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
