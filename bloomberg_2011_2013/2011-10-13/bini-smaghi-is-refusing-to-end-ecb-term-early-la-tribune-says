European Central Bank Executive
board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi is refusing to end his term
early, French daily La Tribune reported, citing an unidentified
person.  Bini Smaghi hasnâ€™t accepted offers to lead the Italian
competition authority, or to take over as head of public works,
according to La Tribune.  Bini Smaghi is under pressure to step down early to make
way for a French policy maker.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
