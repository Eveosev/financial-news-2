The number of Americans filing
claims for jobless benefits was little changed last week,
showing the labor market is making scant progress.  Applications for unemployment insurance payments decreased
1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000, Labor Department
figures showed today. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
number of people on unemployment benefit rolls dropped to the
lowest level in six months.  While U.S. employers hired more workers than anticipated in
September, elevated firings signal companies may be slower to
expand payrolls in the next few months. Political gridlock in
Washington, with the Senate this week blocking the advance of
President Barack Obama’s jobs plan, is another sign that any
improvement on the job front will be slow to develop.  “The labor market is treading water, maybe slightly better
than that,” said  Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at Maria
Fiorini Ramirez Inc. in New York. “Hanging out around 400,000
claims is indicative of a still very soggy labor market that is
not going anywhere fast.”  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 390,000 to
415,000 in the Bloomberg News survey of 50 economists. The Labor
Department initially reported the prior week’s applications at
401,000.  Near-Record Exports  The  U.S. trade deficit  was $45.6 billion in August, little
changed from the previous month, as exports held near a record,
data from the Commerce Department showed today. The gap was in
line with median projection of $45.8 billion in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  Stock-index futures held earlier losses after JPMorgan
Chase & Co., the first of the major banks to post third-quarter
results, said earnings fell. The contract on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index expiring in December dropped 0.4 percent to
1,193 at 8:44 a.m. in New York.  Treasury securities  rose,
sending the yield on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.18
percent from 2.21 percent late yesterday.  A Labor Department official today said there was nothing
unusual in the state data last week. Figures for last week in
four states and the  District of Columbia  were estimated because
government offices were closed on Oct. 10 due to the Columbus
Day holiday.  Average Declines  The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure, fell
to a two-month low of 408,000 from 415,000.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
dropped by 55,000 in the week ended Oct. 1 to 3.67 million, the
fewest since mid April. The continuing claims figure does not
include the number of workers receiving extended benefits under
federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
2,300 to 3.55 million in the week ended Sept. 24.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
fell to 2.9 percent in the week ended Oct. 1 from 3 percent,
today’s report showed. Thirty states and territories reported an
increase in claims, while 23 had a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  September Payrolls  Recession fears eased last week when Labor Department
figures showed American employers added more workers than
forecast in September. Payrolls increased by 103,000 after a
57,000 gain the prior month that was initially reported as no
change. The jobless rate held at 9.1 percent.  Some Federal Reserve officials last month saw
“considerable uncertainty” that growth will pick up and wanted
to keep further asset purchases as an option to boost the
economy, according to the minutes of the central bank’s meeting
issued yesterday.  Financial firms on  New York ’s Wall Street may shed almost
10,000 jobs by the end of 2012 as  Europe ’s debt crisis slows the
economy, New York Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli  said in an Oct. 11
report. After adding 9,900 jobs between January 2010 and April
2011, the securities industry shed 4,100 positions through
August, DiNapoli said. Each job gained or lost in the industry
creates or eliminates three other jobs in  New York City  and
state, he said.  The  U.S. Senate  voted Oct. 10 to block President Obama’s
$447 billion jobs plan. Two Democrats joined the Republican
minority, preventing the bill from moving forward. The
legislation includes cuts in payroll taxes for workers and
employers and provides new funding for roads, bridges and other
infrastructure.  “Tonight’s vote is by no means the end of this fight,”
Obama said in a statement. As they vote on each component,
“members of Congress can either explain to their constituents
why they’re against commonsense, bipartisan proposals to create
jobs, or they can listen to the overwhelming majority of
American people who are crying out for action.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
