The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment decreased,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 11 basis points
to 196 basis points as of 11:35 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. A close of 196 would be the lowest since Oct.
12 while a decline of 11 basis points would be the most since
Oct. 5, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index fell 7 basis points to 193.5
as of 9:24 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. A close of
193.5 would be the lowest since Sept. 21, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan slid 6 basis points to 207.5 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
