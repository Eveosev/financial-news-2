Ireland supports early introduction
of the European Stability Mechanism, the region’s permanent
rescue fund, while opposing bondholder writedowns for countries
other than Greece, Prime Minister  Enda Kenny  said.  The euro area is considering bringing forward the ESM’s
debut by a year to mid-2012. The 17-nation region also is
considering asking bondholders to contribute more to a second
international aid package for Greece crafted in July. The
private sector involvement, or PSI, had been due to entail a 21
percent writedown through debt exchanges and swaps.  “In respect to the ESM, we don’t have any objection to an
early introduction of that,” Kenny told reporters in Brussels
today after meeting with European Commission PresidentJose Barroso. It should “be made perfectly clear that PSI is an
issue of concern not only to Ireland but to other countries. And
the same clarity of the exclusiveness and uniqueness of this in
respect of  Greece , as we referred to in July, should be made
perfectly clear.”  Kenny also backed plans to expand the role of the temporary
rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility by
allowing it to buy sovereign bonds on the secondary market,
offer credit lines to governments and provide for bank
recapitalizations. The EFSF’s current role is to sell bonds to
finance rescue loans.   “The maximum flexibility and maximum use of the existing
tools that are there go a long way to dealing with the crisis
that we face now,” Kenny said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
