Gasoil stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, fell for a second week to the lowest level in almost three
years, according to PJK International BV.  Gasoil inventories dropped 8.1 percent to 2.053 million
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a consultant
in the Netherlands. That’s the least since December 2008.
Supplies of the fuel, which includes heating oil and diesel,
were sent to  France  and the U.K. while cargoes arrived from
Russia and the U.S.  “Refiners have been running at low rates, supporting
product out of storage into end-user systems,” Pieter Kulsen,
founder of PJK, said by phone from Oosterhout.  Gasoline stockpiles rose 11 percent to 605,000 tons, the
most since Aug. 4, according to PJK. Cargoes of the motor fuel
arrived from France,  Russia ,  Spain ,  Sweden  and the U.K. while
product was exported to Morocco,  Mexico ,  Nigeria  and Togo.  Naphtha stockpiles climbed 28 percent to 110,000 tons on
imports from Russia, PJK data show. That’s the highest level
since July 14.  Fuel oil  inventories increased 15 percent to 882,000 tons
on cargoes from France,  Lithuania , Russia and the U.K., the data
show. Jet fuel surged 21 percent to 486,000 tons as cargoes
arrived from the United Arab Emirates.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
