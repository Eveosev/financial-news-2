Iceland central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson said it’s “pointless” to be concerned about the
carry trade returning, newspaper  Vidskiptabladid  reported.  Carry trades will “always be a part of how monetary policy
works,” the governor told the Reykjavik-based newspaper.  Iceland kept its key  interest rate  unchanged at 4.5 percent
on Sept. 21, halting a tightening cycle amid a worsening
European debt crisis. The central bank, which in August raised
borrowing costs for the first time since the failure of
Iceland’s banks in 2008, has signaled that further increases may
be needed to cap inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
