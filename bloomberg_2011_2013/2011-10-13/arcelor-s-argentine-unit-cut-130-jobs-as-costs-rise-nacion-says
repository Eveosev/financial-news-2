Steelmaker  ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s Argentine
unit cut 130 jobs by offering voluntary retirements and ending
contracts with outsourced companies as costs increase, La Nacion
 said , citing company sources it did not identify.  Acindar Industria  Argentina  de Aceros SA cut the jobs at
its main plant in the town of Villa Constitucion, the Buenos
Aires-newspaper said. Acindar wants to cut the number of
outsourced companies it works with from 40 to 10 and to relocate
the workers, Nacion said. The 130 workers weren’t members of
unions, the newspaper said.  Acindar made the move after being affected by rising
salaries and high global steel supplies, Nacion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
