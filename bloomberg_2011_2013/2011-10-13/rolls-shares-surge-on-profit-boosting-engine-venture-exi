Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) , the world’s
second-largest aircraft-engine maker, jumped the most in more
than 2 1/2 years after the company sold its share of a jet-
engine venture to  Pratt & Whitney  for $1.5 billion.  Rolls-Royce’s exit from the International Aero Engines
alliance will give more than a 140 million-pound ($220 million)
boost to annual operating profit, it said in a statement today.
Shares of the London-based company surged as much as 9.4
percent, the most since December 2008. They traded up 7.9
percent at 675.5 pence as of 8:44 a.m.  “It seems a fantastic deal for Rolls-Royce,” said  Jason Adams , an analyst at Nomura International. “I doubt the market
was valuing the business at anywhere near that level.” Adams
has a "buy" rating on the stock.  Rolls-Royce is instead forming a new 50:50 partnership with
Pratt & Whitney, owned by  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , to target
the rapidly-growing market for mid-sized plane engines. The
partners in the IAE alliance sued each other in 2010 for patent
infringement over a larger Pratt & Whitney engine and reached an
impasse on marketing another model for the Airbus SAS A320 jets.  Rolls-Royce will receive an undisclosed payment for 15
years for each hour flown by planes now equipped with V2500
engines made by IAE. The $1.5 billion price tag represents less
than one-half of the net present value of the transaction,
according to Adams.  "Overall the majority of value to Rolls-Royce will be
derived from flight hour payments due over the next 15 years,"
the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
