The U.S. is looking at imposing
sanctions directly on Central Bank of  Iran , said  David Cohen ,
undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial
intelligence.  “We are making progress, but there is still much to be
done to prevent Iran from evading sanctions already in place and
to apply sufficient additional pressure on Iran,” Cohen said in
prepared testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.  “In this regard, we continue to focus on the Central Bank
of Iran,” he said. “Although U.S. financial institutions are
already generally prohibited from doing business with any bank
in Iran -– including the CBI -– further U.S. action against the
CBI, if it attained multilateral support, could further isolate
the CBI, with a potentially powerful impact on Iran.”  If Iran continues on its current course, he added, the U.S.
will “develop new and innovative ways to impose additional
costs on Iran.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
