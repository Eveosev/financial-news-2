Wales  made one starting change for
its Rugby World Cup semifinal against  France  on Oct. 15,
choosing James Hook at fly-half after Rhys Priestland was ruled
out with a shoulder injury.  Priestland wasn’t considered for selection for the match at
Auckland’s Eden Park after getting injured during the 22-10
quarterfinal win over Ireland five days ago, the Welsh Rugby
Union said. He’ll continue his rehabilitation over the next few
days with a view to returning next week, the WRU said.  With Hook taking Priestland’s spot in the starting lineup,
fellow British and Irish Lions representative Stephen Jones,
who’s played a record 102 Tests for Wales, was called onto the
replacements’ bench.  “Time was against Rhys,” Wales coach Warren Gatland said
in a statement. “When we have players of the caliber and
experience of  James Hook  and Stephen Jones coming into the squad
and starting line-up, there is no sense that Rhys’s absence
leaves us any weaker.”  Wales has advanced to its first World Cup semifinal since
the inaugural 1987 tournament, where it finished third.  WALES:  1. Gethin Jenkins, 2. Huw Bennett, 3. Adam Jones 4.
