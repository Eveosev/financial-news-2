The European Union’s representative
on a team of inspectors examining  Greece ’s economy said the
country’s debt sustainability has not fundamentally changed
since June, Kathimerini reported, citing an interview.  Matthias Mors said Greece needs to decide additional budget
measures for 2013 and 2014 in the next six months, according to
the Athens-based newspaper. Mors represents the European
Commission in the so-called troika, which also includes
representatives from the  European Central Bank  and International
Monetary Fund, according to Kathimerini.   Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
