Bangladesh ’s benchmark stock index
rose the most in four months on speculation recent losses that
drove down the gauge to near a five-month low was excessive.  The Dhaka Stock Exchange’s General Index jumped 208.74, or
3.9 percent, to 5,568.36, the most since June 13. The measure
rose for a second day after closing on Oct. 11 at its lowest
level since May 25. The gauge has tumbled 33 percent this year,
set for its worst annual drop since a 67 percent plunge in 1997.  “It’s a great buying opportunity as prices are low,” said
Saiful Islam, vice chairman at BRAC EPL Investment Ltd. in
Dhaka. “The market was in freefall over the past few days.”  Today’s gain helped the DSE General Index cut its losses
for the month to 5.8 percent. The gauge retreated 4.9 percent
last month and 3.8 percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
