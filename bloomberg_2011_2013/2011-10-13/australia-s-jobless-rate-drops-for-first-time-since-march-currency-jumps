Australia ’s unemployment rate
declined for the first time since March as employers added
double the workers economists forecast, boosting bond yields and
sending the local currency to a three-week high.  The number of people employed rose by 20,400, from a
revised 10,500 fall in August, the statistics bureau said in
Sydney today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
24 economists was for a 10,000-job gain. The jobless rate fell
to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent.  The report prompted traders to rein in bets on an interest-
rate cut next month as evidence mounts Australia’s economy is
weathering global market turmoil with improved consumer and
business confidence. Companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  are
hiring in Western Australia and Queensland states to satisfy
 China  and  India ’s demand for coal, iron ore and natural gas.  “The latest rise in employment was certainly a welcome
relief,” said  Savanth Sebastian , a Sydney-based economist at
 Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest lender.
“For those expecting a rate cut in November the latest
employment result does muddy the waters.”  Currency Rebounds  The Australia dollar has risen as much as 9 percent since
it fell to a one-year low 93.88 U.S. cents on Oct. 4 after
 Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  indicated
there’s scope to cut the benchmark rate from a developed-world
high of 4.75 percent. Traders see a 68 percent chance of a
reduction in borrowing costs on Nov. 1, the lowest since Aug. 1,
interbank cash-rate futures show.  The number of full-time jobs advanced by 10,800 in
September to 8.04 million, and part-time employment rose by
9,600 to a record 3.41 million, today’s report showed.
Australia’s participation rate, which measures the labor force
as a percentage of the population over 15 years old, held at
65.6 percent in September, it showed.  Resource-rich states led the gains, with  Western Australia 
adding 7,300 jobs and Queensland 4,900 workers, while the
southern state of Victoria increased employment by 3,400,
today’s report showed. New South Wales, Australia’s most
populous state, led the declines with the loss of 1,300 jobs.  The local dollar climbed to $1.0189 as of 12:24 p.m. in
Sydney, from $1.0174 before the data. The 10-year bond yield
climbed 13 basis points to 4.44 percent, the biggest increase
since Sept. 27.  Employer Caution  “Recent reports strongly suggest the weaker jobs growth in
the past couple of months isn’t because the economy is
slowing,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP
Australia Ltd., a unit of the world’s biggest interdealer
broker. “Rather, employers have been cautious given heightened
uncertainty in  Europe .”  The RBA last week left its key rate unchanged, citing a
“softer” labor market and consumers who are “more concerned
about the possibility of unemployment rising.” The central bank
signaled less concern about wage pressure from a mining
investment boom and said there’s more scope to cut rates if
necessary.  Government reports last week showed the strength of the
mining industry and signaled a rebound in building approvals.  Australia’s exports surged in August to a record A$28.4
billion ($28.9 billion) on coal shipments, and the nation’s
A$3.1 billion trade surplus was the second-widest on record. A
separate release showed the number of permits granted to build
or renovate houses and apartments jumped 11.4 percent from July,
the biggest increase since March 2010.  Retail Sales  Retail sales also advanced more than economists forecast in
August for a second straight month as consumers spent more on
household goods and dining out, an Oct. 5. government report
showed.  The RBA increased rates by 175 basis points from October
2009 through November to its current level, compared with as
little as zero in the U.S. and  Japan .  The policy divergence contributed to a rise in the local
dollar, which reached $1.1081 on July 27, the highest level
since it was freely floated in 1983. It fell about 10 percent
last month amid speculation  Greece  will default and spark a
repeat of the 2008 credit freeze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
