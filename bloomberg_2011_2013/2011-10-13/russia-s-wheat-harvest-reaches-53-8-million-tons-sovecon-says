Russia’s wheat harvest after drying
and cleaning reached 53.8 million metric tons, and the barley
crop was 16.1 million tons,  SovEcon  said.  The figures were derived from Agriculture Ministry data as
of yesterday, the Moscow-based researcher said on its website.
SovEcon forecast the total wheat crop will be 55 million to 56
million tons and the barley crop 16.2 million to 16.4 million
tons.  Wheat and barley fields are mostly harvested, and corn will
make up most of the rest of the volumes to be gathered that will
produce a total grain harvest of about 90 million tons,
according to SovEcon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
