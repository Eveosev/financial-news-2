Angel Archuleta, head of energy
trading at  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA in  Singapore , left the bank,
according to four people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Archuleta, a former trader at Nomura Singapore Ltd., joined
SocGen, France’s second-largest bank by market value, in April
2010. The people, who declined to be identified because the
departure hasn’t been announced, didn’t say why Archuleta is
leaving or where he will go. Kate Henley, a Hong Kong-based
spokeswoman at the bank, didn’t return three calls from
Bloomberg for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
