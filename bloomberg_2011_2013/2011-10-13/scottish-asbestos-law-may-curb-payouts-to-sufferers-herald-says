U.K. insurers may run out of cash to
meet claims from people suffering from asbestos-related
illnesses after the U.K. Supreme Court rejected an attempt to
strike down a Scottish law, the Herald said, citing an industry
group and lawyers.  Insurers lost a case seeking to set aside a law passed by
the Scottish parliament that allows Scots whose lungs are
scarred by asbestos to sue for compensation, the Glasgow-based
newspaper said.  The  Association of British Insurers  wants the Scottish
government and the courts to look at the risk of so-called
compensation tourism, with claimants from England and  Wales 
sueing in the Scottish courts, the Herald said.  People who are really sick may not get compensation as it
will have gone to people who have the scars, or pleural plaques,
and are not as ill,  Andrew Smith , a personal injury lawyer
specializing in asbestos cases, told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
