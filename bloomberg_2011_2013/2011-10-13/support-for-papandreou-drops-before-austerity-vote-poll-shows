Support for Greek Prime Minister
 George Papandreou ’s party fell below 20 percent amid daily
protests and strikes against plans to cut wages and layoff state
workers, according to a research poll.  The  Pasok  party led by Papandreou had the support of 19.5
percent of likely voters, a drop of 5 percentage points from the
month before, the poll, conducted by researcher  VPRC  for
 Epikaira  magazine, showed. Support for the main opposition  New
Democracy  party rose 1 percentage point to 31 percent. The
 Communist Party of Greece  was third with 13.5 percent, a gain of
half a percentage point. Thirty six percent of the 800 people
surveyed said they would abstain from voting.  Papandreou’s government introduced measures to plug
 Greece ’s budget gap for 2011 and 2012, including a new property
tax approved by parliament on Sept. 27. Greece’s Parliament is
expected to vote on plans to cut state wages and pensions and
dismiss 30,000 civil servants next week.  European Union and International Monetary Fund officials
indicated Oct. 11 Greece will qualify for an 8 billion-euro ($11
billion) loan next month, part of a 110 billion-euro bailout to
help avert the country from defaulting.  Papandreou was the least popular party leader in the Greek
parliament with a 76 percent disapproval rating while New
Democracy leader Antonis Samaras had a negative rating of 63
percent, the poll showed.  Nearly half of voters, 48 percent, said elections should be
held immediately while 13 percent said Papandreou had a mandate
to implement his plan of austerity measures to meet conditions
for international loans. Fifty-three percent said they disagreed
with the government’s plan to dismiss 30,000 state workers and
60 percent said they were likely to attend an anti-austerity
demonstration in the near future.  When asked what composition the government should have, 8.6
percent of respondents preferred a coalition between Pasok and
 New Democracy  while 13.1 percent favored a coalition of left-
leaning parties and 4.8 percent said a New Democracy majority.
About 3.5 percent of those polled said they preferred a Pasok
majority and 47.4 percent said neither of the compositions was
acceptable.  The survey was conducted from Oct. 6-10 and the poll has a
margin of error of 3.54 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
