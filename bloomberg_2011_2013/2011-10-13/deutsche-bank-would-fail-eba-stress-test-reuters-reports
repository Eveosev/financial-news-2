Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  would fail a
European Banking Authority stress test of European lenders
currently being discussed, Reuters reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The German lender would need about 9 billion euros ($12
billion) to reach a minimum core tier 1 ratio of 9 percent under
an adverse stress scenario, Reuters reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the figures.  Deutsche Bank spokesman Michael Lermer declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
