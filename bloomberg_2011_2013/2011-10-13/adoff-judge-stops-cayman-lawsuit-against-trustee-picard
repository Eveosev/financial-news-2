A lawsuit against the liquidator of
 Bernard Madoff ’s firm in the  Cayman Islands  was stopped by a
U.S. bankruptcy judge who said Maxam Absolute Return Fund Ltd.’s
action was “a clear attack on this court’s exclusive
jurisdiction and a blatant attempt to hijack the key issues to
another court,” according to a court filing.  Trustee Irving Picard sued Maxam for about $100 million of
money taken out of the Ponzi scheme.  To contact the reporter on this story:
