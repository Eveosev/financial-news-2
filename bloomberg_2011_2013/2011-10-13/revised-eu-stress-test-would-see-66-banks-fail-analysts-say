At least 66 of Europe’s biggest
banks would fail a revised European Union stress test and need
to raise about 220 billion euros ($302.3 billion) of capital,
Credit Suisse AG analysts said.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , Deutsche Bank AG and  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA would need the most, a combined total of about 47
billion euros, analysts led by Carla Antunes-Silva wrote in a
note to clients today.  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
would each need about 13 billion euros of fresh capital.  Eight banks out of the 90 tested failed the  European
Banking Authority ’s July 15 stress test, with a combined capital
shortfall of 2.5 billion euros.  “We would see a bank recapitalization as a step in the
right direction, although at this stage whilst the market is
becoming increasingly optimistic, we remain cautious until
further details” emerge, Antunes-Silva said. “We may see
proposals over the coming days and weeks, but implementation may
take longer than hoped for.”  European policy makers are debating how to recapitalize the
region’s troubled banks as the sovereign debt crisis threatens
to damage balance sheets, undermining recovery prospects.
European leaders meet on Oct. 23 to discuss the crisis, which
has driven  Greece  toward default and threatened the survival of
the 17-nation currency.  Credit Suisse’s analysis is based on a re-run of the EBA’s
July stress tests updated to reflect banks’ first-half results.
It uses a 9 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio, rather than the 5
percent rate used in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
