Sanofi,  France ’s biggest drugmaker,
plans to raise a 3 billion euros ($4.12 billion)  credit line  to
refinance a deal maturing next year, according to three people
with knowledge of the situation.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, BNP Paribas SA and
Societe Generale SA are coordinating the one-year transaction
that can be extended by a maximum of two years, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the deal is private.  The bank line will replace Sanofi’s 5.8 billion-euro
revolving credit signed in 2005, said the people.  Jean-Marc Podvin, a spokesman for the Paris-based company,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
