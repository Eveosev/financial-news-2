HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s U.K. private
banking unit won a ruling over whether it had to disclose the
identity of employees who reported clients’ suspicious financial
transactions to authorities.  A London appeals court said today that a Zimbabwean couple
didn’t have the right to discover which HSBC employees reported
attempted money transfers from their account to the  Serious
Organised Crime Agency . The employees, whose names were redacted
by the bank during litigation, suspected the money may have been
criminal property, according to the judgment.  Jayesh Shah and his wife Shaleetha Mahabeer sued HSBC in
2007 for more than $300 million, claiming that delays in
executing four transfers from their account for over $38 million
caused the losses. They said they were stigmatized in  Zimbabwe 
and suspected of  money laundering  because of HSBC, causing
authorities there to freeze and seize their assets.  The Zimbabwean police were alerted by a former employee of
the couple who didn’t receive a payment, the court said today.
The ex-employee told police that Shah was suspected of money
laundering in the U.K., leading them to seize his investments.  “The more I listened to the explanation of why the
claimants wanted the names, the more convinced I became that, to
use the familiar cliche, this was a fishing expedition,”
Justice Kim Lewison said. “It is all speculation and surmise.”  A spokeswoman for Shah and Mahabeer’s lawyers at Edwards
Wildman Palmer UK LLP declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
