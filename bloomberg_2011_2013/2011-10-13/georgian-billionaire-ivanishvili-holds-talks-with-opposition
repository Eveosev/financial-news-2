Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili held talks with opposition leaders including former
United Nations envoy Irakli Alasania after announcing plans to
create a party to challenge President Mikheil Saakashvili.  Ivanishvili, a Rossiiskiy Kredit Bank  board member  whose
 wealth  Forbes magazine estimated in March at $5.5 billion, equal
to almost half of  Georgia ’s $11.7 billion economy, said he found
common ground with the main opposition parties, his spokeswoman
Elza Nabakhteveli said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Georgian government revoked Ivanishvili’s citizenship
on Oct. 11. Eka Beselia, a lawyer for the billionaire, told
reporters yesterday that he would challenge the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
