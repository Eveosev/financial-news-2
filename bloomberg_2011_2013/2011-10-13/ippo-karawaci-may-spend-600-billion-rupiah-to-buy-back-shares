PT Lippo Karawaci plans to spend as
much as 600 billion rupiah to buy back its shares over an 18-
month period after obtaining shareholders approval, the
Indonesian property developer said.  Lippo will hold a shareholders meeting on Nov. 15, the
company said in a statement published in Bisnis  Indonesia  today.
The buyback aims to stabilize Lippo’s share price so that it
better reflects the company’s performance, it said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
