Home prices  in Southern California
fell 5.2 percent last month from a year earlier as foreclosure
sales accounted for a third of transactions,  DataQuick  said.  The median paid for houses and condominiums was $280,000 in
 Los Angeles , Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, down from $295,500 in September 2010 and up 0.4
percent from $279,000 in August of this year, the San Diego-
based data seller said today in a report. Prices have fallen for
seven consecutive months on a year-over-year basis.  A total of 18,149 homes sold last month, up 0.3 percent
from a year earlier and down 7.7 percent from August, DataQuick
said. Almost one in three transactions involved a foreclosure,
while one in five was a short sale, where the contract price is
less than the amount owed. Deals for properties priced less than
$300,000 rose 5.6 percent from a year earlier.  “Sales weren’t great but, like some other economic
indicators of late, they came in a bit higher than some might
have expected,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in a
statement. “Holding steady with a year ago isn’t so bad when
you consider the hits the housing market has taken in recent
months, including a big psychological blow from a tanking stock
market in early August.”  Prices fell from a year earlier in all six Southern
California counties DataQuick tracks, led by an 8.8 percent
decline to a median $310,000 in Los Angeles. Orange County fell
4.5 percent to $425,000 and Riverside dropped 4.5 percent to
$191,000, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
