Zynga Inc., the online-game
developer that is planning an initial public offering, filed to
list its shares on the  Nasdaq  Stock Market.  Zynga has applied to list its stock under the symbol ZNGA,
according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. Zynga said in July it would seek to raise
$1 billion in an IPO.  By listing on the Nasdaq, the gaming startup bucks a recent
trend of young Internet companies listing on the New York Stock
Exchange -- a group that includes LinkedIn Corp., Pandora Media
Inc. and Renren Inc. The Nasdaq, home to Apple Inc., Google Inc.
and Microsoft Corp., has traditionally had an edge with
technology companies.  Earlier this week, Zynga announced a new service, called
Project Z, geared toward reducing its dependence on users of
Facebook Inc.’s social network. The company also announced new
games, including “Zynga Bingo,” “CastleVille” and “Hidden
Chronicles.” San Francisco-based Zynga is the biggest developer
of games for Facebook.  Founded in 2007, Zynga offers its games for free and then
sells virtual items within applications, such as a townhouse in
“CityVille” or a shipyard in “Empires & Allies.” The
worldwide virtual-goods market will more than double to $20.3
billion in 2014, from $9.28 billion last year, according to
ThinkEquity LLC, a San Francisco-based research firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
