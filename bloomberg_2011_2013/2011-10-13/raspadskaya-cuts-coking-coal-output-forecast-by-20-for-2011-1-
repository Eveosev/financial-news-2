OAO Raspadskaya, a Russian coking
coal producer, lowered its output forecast for this year by
“about 20 percent” after third-quarter volumes dropped because
of delays restoring its flagship mine.  Third-quarter coal  production  declined 28 percent to 1.21
million metric tons from the previous three-month period,
Raspadskaya said today in an e-mailed statement. The initial
2011 forecast had been 8.5 million tons of coal, which would
make the revised target about 6.8 million tons.  Raspadskaya may resume some coal exports this month after
talks with foreign buyers, some of whom are previous customers,
and with seaports in  Russia ’s Far East, the company said.  The average price of coking coal concentrate fell 4 percent
to $167.30 a metric ton in the third quarter from the previous
three months, according to the statement. Domestic prices slid
about 3.6 percent in rubles terms to 4,750 rubles ($151.90) a
ton this month and will remain at that level until the end of
January 2012, Raspadskaya said.  Raspadskaya’s plans to restore operations at its flagship
mine, which suffered deadly blasts in May 2010, fell behind
schedule as the company sought regulatory permission and dealt
with remaining pockets of underground fire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
