Russian planting of spring crops
fell 31 percent from a year earlier because of delays caused by
adverse weather, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Spring crops covered 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million
acres) as of today, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement,
citing a “late start of sowing because of unfavorable
weather.” Of that area, spring grains covered more than 1
million hectares, or 3.4 percent of planned seeding, it said.  Crops may overcome sowing delays because weather is
improving and soil has sufficient moisture, Anna Strashnaya,
head of the agro-meteorological department at  Russia ’s weather-
forecasting center, told Bloomberg yesterday.  Winter grains are in “good condition” and losses are
below average rates, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
