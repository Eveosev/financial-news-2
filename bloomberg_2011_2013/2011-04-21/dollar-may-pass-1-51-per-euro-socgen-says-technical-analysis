The dollar’s move through
resistance areas around $1.45 per euro puts the currency on
course for a depreciation past $1.51, according to Societe
Generale SA’s technical analysts.  The dollar’s next resistance levels are around $1.47 and
$1.4830, and a breach of those may propel the greenback to
$1.5145, its lowest point in 2009,  France ’s second-largest bank
said in a research note today. Should the currency depreciate
below that level, it will begin setting 2 ½-year lows.  The U.S. currency has weakened for three consecutive days,
slumping to a 16-month low of $1.4649 to the euro today. It
traded 0.6 percent weaker at $1.4613 at 12:10 p.m. in  London .  The dollar’s current weakening trend began in June 2010,
according to SocGen. The greenback has slumped 19 percent since
June 7, 2010, when it traded as strong as $1.1877 as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis dragged the euro lower. The single
currency reached an all-time high of $1.6038 on June 15, 2008,
according to Bloomberg data.  The U.S. currency slumped against all but one of its 16
major peers today as gains in stock markets around the world and
signs of improving economic growth spurred demand for higher-
yielding assets. The  Federal Reserve ’s benchmark interest rate
of between zero and 0.25 percent makes it profitable to borrow
in dollars and invest the money in markets where returns are
higher, a strategy known as the carry trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
