The  New York Mets  lost 4-3 to the
 Houston Astros  last night to fall to 1-8 this year at Citi
Field, their worst home start to a Major League Baseball
season.  The Mets, who at 5-13 overall have the worst record in the
major leagues so far this season, eclipsed their previous worst
start at home -- a 1-7 mark set in 1962, their first season.  “We have to find some kind of way to be honest about what
kind of team we are,” Mets pitcher R.A. Dickey, who took the
loss, told reporters. “We can’t just keep telling ourselves,
‘We’re a better team than this.’ We may not be.”  The Mets have lost nine of their past 10 games and are
last in the five-team National League East standings, 6 1/2
games behind the  Philadelphia Phillies . Houston remains last in
the NL Central Division with a 7-11 record, having won two
straight games for the first time this year after a 1-7 start.  Houston took a 3-0 lead in the second inning on run-
scoring singles by Bud Norris and Michael Bourn.  Carlos Beltran 
made it 3-1 in the third with a run-scoring double and a two-
run homer by Daniel Murphy in the sixth tied it at 3-3.  Hunter Pence completed the scoring with a 404-foot homer
to left field in the eighth.  The Mets will try to avoid a sweep in the three-game
series today, before hosting the  Arizona Diamondbacks  in a
three-game weekend series beginning tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
