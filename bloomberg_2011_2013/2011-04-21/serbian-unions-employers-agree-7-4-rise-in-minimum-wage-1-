Serbian unions and employers agreed
to a 7.4 percent increase in the  minimum wage , Labor Minister
Rasim Ljajic said.  The increase in the net hourly rate, to 102 dinars ($1.48),
or $260 a month, from 95 dinars per hour, will take effect in
June, benefiting some 98,000 people who work for the legal
minimum, Ljajic said. Another 300,000 employees have contracts
in which the lowest wage serves as a benchmark, with multiples,
for their salaries.  “Neither side got what it wanted, it’s a compromise
solution,” Ljajic told reporters today in Belgrade after
meeting with representatives of the two biggest union
organizations and the  Serbian Association of Employers .  Leaders of the Nezavisnost union and the  Confederation of
Autonomous Trade Unions  had demanded 105 dinars per hour, while
the employers offered only 96 dinars per hour amid double-digit
inflation.  “Wages are low but productivity in the country is also
poor,” said Nebojsa Atanackovic, president of the employers’
association, responding to the unions’ argument that the Serbian
minimum wage is  among the lowest  in  Europe .  The government helped mediate the agreement and promised a
tax break for employers in order to share with them part of the
increased cost of labor, Atanackovic said.  Ljajic said the state agreed to allow a higher non-taxable
base of personal income, from 7,300 dinars a month, to an amount
that will be determined by the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
