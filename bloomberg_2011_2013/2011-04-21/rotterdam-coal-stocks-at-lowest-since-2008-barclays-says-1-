Coal stockpiles in the port of
Rotterdam are at the lowest level since August 2008 as nuclear
power cutbacks increased demand for coal,  Barclays Capital  said.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  ordered the idling last
month of the country’s seven oldest nuclear power plants for
safety checks after an earthquake and tsunami damaged six atomic
reactors in Japan. The price of coal delivered to northwest
Europe has jumped 66 percent in the past 12 months to $128.11,
according to data from IHS McCloskey in Petersfield, England.  “We see a greater pull for coal in Europe,” Amrita Sen,
an analyst at Barclays Capital in  London , wrote in a report
today. “The likelihood of holding a higher level of steady
state coal stockpile, now that the use of nuclear as base load
in many countries has been reduced/questioned, could well
trigger an additional bout of restocking.”  Last month’s earthquake and tsunami in  Japan  crippled the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, causing it to spew radiation
in the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in Ukraine, then
part of the Soviet Union, in 1986.  To contact the reporter on this story:
