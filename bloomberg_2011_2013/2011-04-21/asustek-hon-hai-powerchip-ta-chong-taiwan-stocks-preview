NT$109.50. Largan Precision Co. (3008 TT), the supplier of
camera lenses for Apple’s iPad, advanced 2.4 percent to NT$921.  Apple reported profit that almost doubled in the second

NT$248.50, the steepest gain since March 31. The board of
directors at the maker of low-cost computers approved a cash

on 2010 earnings, the Taipei-based company said in an exchange
statement yesterday.  Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corp. (3189)  (3189 TT) surged 6.9
percent to NT$96.10, the highest level since March 10, after its
customer Qualcomm Inc., the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips,
reported second-quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates.  Ta Chong Bank Co. (2847 TT) advanced 2.8 percent to
NT$10.85, the most since March 22. The bank’s board of directors
plans to ask shareholders to authorize it to sell as much as 1
billion new shares to replenish working capital and to seek
opportunities for strategic alliance, the Taipei-based lender
said in an exchange statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
