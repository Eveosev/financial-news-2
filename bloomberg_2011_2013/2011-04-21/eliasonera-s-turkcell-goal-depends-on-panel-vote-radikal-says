TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  may succeed in
ousting Colin Williams, chairman of Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri
AS, should it win a vote with partner Altimo on electing the
head of a three-man panel to run a  shareholders’ meeting  today,
Radikal said.  Williams is expected to be selected as the panel’s chief,
meaning TeliaSonera and Russia’s Altimo, partners with Turkey’s
Cukurova Holding in Turkcell, will fail in their aims, the
Istanbul-based newspaper reported.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
