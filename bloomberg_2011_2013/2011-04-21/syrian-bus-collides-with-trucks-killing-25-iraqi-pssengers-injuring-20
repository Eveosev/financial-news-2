A bus collided with two trucks in
 Syria , killing 25 Iraqi passengers and injuring 20, the state-
run  Syrian Arab News Agency  reported.  The bus plunged about 15 meters (50 feet) into a valley
after the collision took place on a road between the capital,
Damascus, and the city of Homs, SANA said.  The driver of the bus lost control of the vehicle, leading
to the crash, SANA said, citing the Damascus police chief,
Brigadier General Damin Azzam.  The casualties were evacuated by 20 ambulances to hospitals
in Douma and Harasta.  Homs has been the site of clashes this week between anti-
government protesters and the security forces in which activists
said at least 18 people were killed.  -- Editors: Heather Langan, Karl Maier  To contact the reporter on this story:
