Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-
largest bank, plans to cut between 100 and 1,000 jobs at its
U.K. corporate unit to reduce costs and boost profits.  Employees are being offered voluntary redundancy packages,
said Daniel Hunter, a spokesman for the London-based bank.
Barclays employs about 11,000 people globally in its corporate
banking unit.  “As part of the transformation of Barclays Corporate we
are examining ways to optimize growth as well as control costs,
and to this end have entered a period of consultation with our
employees’ trade union and representative bodies,” Hunter said
in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  is reviewing the
bank’s divisions to focus on operations that deliver the
greatest returns relative to the capital they require. He told
lawmakers in January it was time for banks to stop apologizing
for the financial crisis and start rebuilding confidence.  Barclays, the best-performing U.K. bank stock this year,
rose 1.5 percent pence to 298.9 pence as of the close of trading
in  London . The stock climbed 14.2 percent this year for a market
value of about 36.4 billion pounds ($60.3 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
