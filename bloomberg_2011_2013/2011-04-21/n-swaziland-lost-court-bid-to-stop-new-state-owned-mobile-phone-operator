MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s Swaziland unit
lost a court bid to stop Swaziland Posts and Telecommunications
Corp. from offering mobile-phone services in the country.  There isn’t a conflict of interest in the state-owned
telecommunications company starting services as it is no longer
a shareholder in  MTN Swaziland Ltd. , High Court Judge Bheki
Maphalala said in the Mbabane-based court yesterday. The
company’s 41 percent shareholding in MTN Swaziland was
transferred to the ministry of finance, he said.  Swaziland Posts and Telecommunications is also no longer
the industry regulator after that responsibility was taken over
by the communications ministry, Maphalala said.  MTN Swaziland is the only mobile-phone operator in the
southern African nation, and is 30 percent owned by  South
Africa ’s MTN Group. The country’s King Mswati III owns a 10
percent stake in the company.  “We are dissatisfied with the judgment both in facts and
in law,” MTN Swaziland spokesman Mpumelelo Makhubu said in an
e-mailed response to a request for comment. “We are going
through it and will consider options thereafter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
