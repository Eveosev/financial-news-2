Uzbekistan and  China  plan to expand
a pipeline to boost Central Asian gas supplies to the world’s
biggest energy consumer.  Chinese President Hu Jintao and Uzbek President Islam Karimov signed an agreement giving state support to the project
to build a third line along a link that now runs across
Uzbekistan from Turkmenistan, according to a statement on the
Uzbek government website after the leaders met in China.  The new pipeline will have capacity to carry 25 billion
cubic meters of Uzbek gas a year to China, according to the
statement, which didn’t give a timeline for the project.  China has turned to Central Asia to supply growing gas
demand, opening the pipeline from  Turkmenistan  at the end of
2009. Turkmenistan plans to supply China with 17 billion cubic
meters of gas this year.  Uzbekistan has signed an accord to supply China National
Petroleum Corp. with 10 billion cubic meters of gas a year,
according to a June statement on the Chinese company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
