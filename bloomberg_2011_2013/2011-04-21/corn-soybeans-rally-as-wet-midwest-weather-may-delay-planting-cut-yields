Corn and soybeans rose on
speculation that wet, cold weather across the U.S. Midwest will
limit planting and reduce yields.  Fields from central  Arkansas  to Detroit may get as much as
8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain the next 10 days, keeping
soils saturated, said Tim Bowden, a senior meteorologist for
Planalytics Inc. in Berwyn,  Pennsylvania . Farms from  Nebraska  to
northern  Indiana  will receive as much as 4 inches of rain, and
the cool weather will slow evaporation, Bowden said.  “The markets are focused on the extended planting delays
developing in the Midwest,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.
“Farmers are already looking at shorter-season varieties,”
which will yield less than normal, he said.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 4 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $7.445 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Prices have doubled in the past year, and on
April 11 touched $7.8875, the highest since June 2008. Still,
the commodity dropped 0.7 percent for the week. The CBOT will be
closed tomorrow in observance of the Good Friday holiday.  Soybean futures for July delivery advanced 20.5 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $13.8975 a bushel in Chicago. The most-active
futures gained 3.5 percent this week, after touching a three-
week low of $13.2825 on April 14.  Soybeans also rose on increased U.S. sales to  China , the
world’s biggest importer and consumer, Schultz said. Rising
sales of corn for delivery after Sept. 1 provided support, he
said. The U.S. is the largest grower and exporter of both crops.  U.S. Exports Gain  U.S. exporters sold 348,960 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended April 14 for delivery before Aug. 31, more than
double the 130,191 tons sold a week earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said today.  China  bought more than 50 percent of
the total.  Sales  of corn for delivery after Sept. 1 totaled 243,908
tons, pushing the accumulated total to 3.132 million, four times
higher than at the same time last year, USDA data show.  “The sales to China were a surprise with talk about
cancelations this week,” Schultz said. “Overseas demand for
this year’s corn crop is rising because of the weather
problems.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
