Gasoline climbed to a 33-month high
as President  Barack Obama  announced that the U.S. Justice
Department will study the role of traders and speculators in oil
markets and how they contribute to high gasoline prices.  Crude
oil  and ethanol advanced. Heating oil slipped.  The administration created a working group to explore
whether oil and gasoline prices are being driven higher by
illegal manipulation.  “We are going to make sure that no one is taking advantage
of American consumers for their own short-term gain,” Obama
said in Reno,  Nevada .  Gasoline  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.13 cents, or 1 percent, to
$3.3086 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest settlement since July
15, 2008. Gasoline, which gained 0.6 percent this week, has
increased 45 percent in a year.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 0.3 cent to $3.84 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its
website. That was the highest price since Sept. 16, 2008.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for June delivery rose 84 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $112.29 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , capping
a weekly gain of 2.4 percent. Prices are up 23 percent this year
and 34 percent in the past year.  “We have bullish information going into a long weekend,”
said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, an energy
advisory firm in Austin,  Texas . “The dollar continues to
weaken, yesterday’s report was bullish for oil across the board
and the overall economic outlook is improving.”  Heating Oil  Heating oil for May delivery dropped 2.22 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1992 a gallon on the Nymex, closing the week with
