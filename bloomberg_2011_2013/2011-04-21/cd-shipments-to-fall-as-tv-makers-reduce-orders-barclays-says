Liquid-crystal display shipments
will likely fall this quarter as television makers in  Japan  and
China scale back purchases, Barclays Plc said.  Global LCD shipments may fall 1.1 percent from a year
earlier to 45.7 million units, the investment bank said in a
report yesterday. LCD factories will likely produce at 74.7
percent of capacity during the quarter, the lowest utilization
ratio in more than two years, it said.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Samsung Electronics Corp. and other TV makers
are probably revising orders as their TV sales targets were
optimistic, the report said. Sharp Corp.’s suspension of some
production is also undermining industry shipments, it said.  The production adjustments by Osaka-based Sharp, Japan’s
largest LCD maker, may be prolonged depending on sales of the
company’s Aquos TVs and inventory level, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
