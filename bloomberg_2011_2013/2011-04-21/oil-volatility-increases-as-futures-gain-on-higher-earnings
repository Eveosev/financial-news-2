Oil options volatility rose as
front-month futures increased for a third day in  New York  after
earnings boosted confidence in the strength of an economic
rebound in the U.S.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.8 percent as of 2 p.m. in New York, up
from 26.6 percent yesterday. It was 29 percent a week ago.  “Crude volatility came back at the end of the day and
ended up about unchanged,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president
of Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “Early on we saw some
covering of June $125 calls, some selling in September $150
calls.”  Oil for June delivery rose 84 cents to settle at $112.29 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 34
percent from a year ago.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$130 calls with 2,471 lots changing hands. They were up 1 cent
at 23 cents a barrel. June $129 calls, the next most active
contract, gained 1 cent to 25 cents a barrel with 1,845
contracts trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $90 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 10,080 lots changing hands. They fell 3
cents to 5 cents a barrel. The next most active option, July $95
puts, dropped 32 cents to 40 cents a barrel on 6,182 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 44,075
contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 43,539 and
December $120 calls with 38,542.  To contact the reporter on this story:
