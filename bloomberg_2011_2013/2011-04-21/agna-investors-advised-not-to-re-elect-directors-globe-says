Proxy advisers ISS Proxy Advisory
Services and Glass Lewis and Co. are recommending that investors
of  Magna International Inc. (MG)  shouldn’t re-elect the firm’s board
of directors, the Globe and Mail reported.  Directors of the Aurora, Ontario auto-parts maker failed
shareholders last year with their work on a deal to buy the
shares of company founder  Frank Stronach , the newspaper said.  ISS, the largest proxy advisory firm in North America, said
investors should withhold their votes for the appointment of
three directors, including former Ontario Premier Mike Harris.
Glass Lewis has recommended withholding votes on all directors
except two new nominees, the Globe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
