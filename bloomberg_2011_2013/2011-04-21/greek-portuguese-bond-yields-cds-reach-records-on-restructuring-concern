Greek and Portuguese yields climbed
to records and the cost to insure the nations’ bonds against
default jumped to all-time highs amid mounting concern countries
in the region will have to restructure their debt.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Irish 10-year
bonds instead of benchmark German bonds rose above 700 basis
points for the first time, while the spread between Greek 10-
year bond yields and bunds widened to the most since at least
1998, when Bloomberg began collecting the data.  Portugal ’s 10-
year spread over bunds also reached a record. France sold bonds
maturing between 2013 and 2040.  “These rumors about restructuring are the key factor that
have been driving yields up,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior
fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. “The idea of
a restructuring is clearly scary. This is why people are trying
to get rid of the bonds. It’s just speculation at the moment,
but it is driving yields up.”  Greek 10-year bond yields rose as much as 20 basis points,
reaching a euro-era record of 14.95 percent, before trading at
14.93 percent at 4:33 p.m. in London. That’s up from 13.83
percent on April 15. Two-year yields also reached a record,
climbing as much as 131 basis points to 23.33 percent. That
compares with 18.50 percent at the end of last week.  European government bond markets are closed on April 22 and
25 for holidays. Trading will resume on April 26.  ‘More Pressure’  Two-year yields have reached records in each of the past
four days even as Greek officials said they have no plans for a
debt restructuring. The cost of insuring Greek sovereign bonds
jumped 40 basis points to 1,340 basis points according to CMA
prices for credit default swaps. That signals a 68 percent
chance of default within five years. Portuguese default swaps
rose 24 basis points to 662, also a record. Contracts on Ireland
increased 40 basis points to 663, approaching the record closing
level of 674 on Jan. 10, CMA prices show.  “Every day that goes by, the market is adding more
pressure for them to restructure,” said Eric Wand, a rates
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “We
don’t think there’s any great rush for Greece to go down the
restructuring route, but I don’t imagine the market is going to
let this one lie.”  Portuguese 10-year government bond yields rose to a euro-
era record of 9.58 percent. That’s an increase of 58 basis
points since April 15. The yield on the nation’s two-year note
climbed to a record 11.52 percent, up from 9.81 percent at the
end of last week. Ireland’s two-year note yields rose to an all-
time high of 11.58 percent, while the nation’s 10-year yield
reached 10.49 percent.  International Bailout  Earlier this month, Portugal became the third euro-region
country to seek an international bailout after  Greece  sparked a
sovereign-debt crisis that threatened to splinter the currency
bloc a year ago and then engulfed Ireland.  The Greek-German 10-year spread widened to 1,167 basis
points today from 1,045 on April 15. The Portuguese-German
spread widened to 631 basis points from 562 at the end of last
week.  The 10-year bund yield dropped four basis points to 3.27
percent today, down from 3.38 percent on April 15. German two-
year note yields were six basis points lower at 1.77 percent,
from 1.84 percent at the end of last week.  “Under current plans, Greece has to finance part of its
 budget deficit  through the markets next year, but this looks
increasingly impossible,” Joost van Leenders, a strategist at
BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Amsterdam wrote in a note
published today. “If so, it would need an even bigger bailout
or have to restructure its debt.”  Ifo, French Auction  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  doesn’t have a majority in
her coalition government in favor of bailing out euro-region
members under the current terms and conditions, the Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing people in the coalition it
didn’t identify.  A report showed business confidence in  Germany  declined in
April. The Munich-based Ifo institute’s gauge declined to 110.4
from 111.1 in March. Economists expected a decline to 110.5,
according to the median of 38 forecasts.  The French five-year note yield fell four basis points to
2.92 percent even as the nation sold an additional 4.89 billion
euros of the securities today. Investors bid for 2.03 times the
amount of debt on sale. That’s down from a so-called bid-to-
cover of 2.58 at the previous auction of the notes on March 17.  France  also sold a total of 3.68 billion euros of notes
maturing in 2013 and 2015, as well as 1.93 billion euros of
inflation-protected securities due 2019, 2022 and 2040.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 2.1
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries have returned 0.4
percent. French debt has lost 1.6 percent, the indexes show.
Greece’s has declined 8.7 percent, Portugal’s 12.3 percent and
Ireland’s 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
