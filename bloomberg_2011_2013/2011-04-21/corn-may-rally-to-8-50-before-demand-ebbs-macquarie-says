Corn prices may rise to $8.50 a
bushel before demand ebbs for livestock feed and fuel made from
the grain,  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG)  said.  “Ethanol and feed sectors continue to make money using
corn despite today’s high price,” London-based analysts Alex Bos and Kona Haque said in a report today. Corn prices have more
than doubled in the past year and rose as high as $7.49 today on
the Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
