Canadian stocks rose, completing a
a weekly gain, as a weaker dollar boosted raw-material producers
and companies including Morgan Stanley and Apple Inc. topped
analysts’ profit estimates.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 1.5 percent as the metal settled above $1,500 an ounce
for the first time. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the
world’s largest fertilizer producer by market value, climbed 1.2
percent after Mackie Research Capital Corp. raised its rating on
the company. BlackBerry maker  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  dropped
1.3 percent after Apple said iPhone unit sales more than doubled
in the second quarter from a year earlier.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 74.54
points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,972.02. For the week, the Canadian
stock benchmark gained 1.3 percent.  “There is a continuing downward pressure on the U.S.
dollar, and that is likely to continue,” said Michael Smedley,
who helps manage about C$1 billion ($1.05 billion) as a  money
manager  at Morgan Meighen & Associates Ltd. in Toronto. “The
upward power on the commodity prices is related to the weakness
in the  U.S. dollar . You need more U.S. dollars all the time to
buy these things.”  The S&P/TSX has advanced 21 percent in the past nine months
as the U.S. Dollar Index fell 11 percent. Gold surged 26 percent
to a record and silver soared 162 percent to the highest since
1980.  U.S. Dollar  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against a basket
of six major peers, retreated 0.3 percent today. The dollar has
fallen due in part to concern about the country’s budget
deficit, speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will not follow
other central banks in raising  interest rates  soon and higher
 oil prices ,  Camilla Sutton , chief currency strategist at  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , said in a note to clients.  Gold increased by $4.90 to settle at $1,503.80 in  New York 
while silver rallied 3.6 percent.  Barrick climbed 1.5 percent to C$53.07.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal by market value,
rose 1.2 percent to a record close of C$53.07.  Semafo Inc. (SMF) ,
which mines gold in  Africa , advanced 5.8 percent to C$8.72.  Newstrike Capital Inc. (NES) , which explores for gold in  Mexico ,
soared 35 percent to a record close of C$2.29 after reporting
drilling results.  Teck, Ivanhoe  Copper climbed for a third day in New York.  Teck Resources
Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s largest base-metals and coal producer, increased
2.2 percent to C$53.83. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., which is developing
a copper and gold mine in  Mongolia  with Rio Tinto Group, rose
1.7 percent to C$25.46.  Potash Corp. rallied 1.2 percent to C$55.35 after John Chu,
a Mackie analyst, boosted his rating on the shares to “buy”
from “hold.” In a note to clients, Chu cited a recent decline
in the shares’ price relative to forecast earnings.  Ninety-three of 115 S&P 500 companies and four of 10
S&P/TSX companies that have reported earnings since April 11
have beaten their average analyst estimate.  Canada’s six largest banks and three biggest insurers each
advanced. Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada’s third-largest lender by
assets, increased 0.9 percent to C$57.70.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,
Canada’s No. 2 lender, climbed 1 percent to C$83.10.  Manulife
Financial Corp. (MFC) , North America’s fourth-biggest insurer, rose
0.7 percent to C$16.80.  Natural Gas   The S&P/TSX Energy Index gained for a third day after the
U.S. reported a smaller increase in natural gas stockpiles than
most analysts in a Bloomberg survey had forecast. Gas futures
advanced 2.4 percent in New York.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
increased 1.6 percent to C$43.19.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , an oil and gas
producer with operations on five continents, climbed 4.2 percent
to C$23.13. Oilfield-services provider  Trican Well Service Ltd. (TCW) 
rose 3.8 percent to C$22.89.  Second Wave Petroleum Inc. (SCS) , which explores for oil and gas
in western Canada, surged 29 percent, the most in 27 months, to
C$3.15 after saying it has completed its first horizontal oil
well at Beaverhill Lake in Alberta.  RIM dropped 1.3 percent to C$51.29 after Apple said it sold
18.7 million iPhones last quarter, surpassing the 16.3 million
average of 13 analyst forecasts. RIM shares have plunged 31
percent since Feb. 19.  Celestica Inc. (CLS) , which makes electronics for companies
including RIM, rallied 4.9 percent to C$10.54 after reporting
first-quarter earnings that topped the average of 13 analyst
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story;
