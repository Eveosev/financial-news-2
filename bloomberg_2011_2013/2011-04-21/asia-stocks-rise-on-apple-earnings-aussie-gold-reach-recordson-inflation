Stocks rose, with the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbing to an almost three-year high, as
higher-than-estimated earnings boosted confidence in the global
economy. Commodities rallied for a third day as the dollar
touched a 16-month low against the euro.  The Dow added 52.45 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,505.99 at
4 p.m. in New York, its highest level since June 5, 2008. The
MSCI World Index climbed 0.7 percent. Gold rose to a record for
a fifth day as silver reached a 31-year high. The Dollar Index
tumbled 0.4 percent to 74.102, the lowest level since August
2008, as it depreciated as much as 0.9 percent to $1.4649 versus
the euro, slid to a record low versus the Australian dollar and
the weakest in at least 40 years versus the Swiss franc.  Equities added to yesterday’s 2 percent advance in the  MSCI
World (MXWO) , this year’s biggest global rally, as earnings at
companies from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to  Morgan Stanley (MS)  topped analysts’
projections. Of the 115 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index that posted results since April 11, 81 percent beat per-
share profit estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The run rates on both revenue and profits are really
coming in strong, so it’s not just cost-cutting,” said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at Boston-based  MFS
Investment Management , which oversees about $230 billion. “This
is finally the evidence the market needs to see that this isn’t
a fluke. This is a self-sustaining recovery.”  Earnings Season  Earnings-per-share have grown 19 percent for the S&P 500
companies that released quarterly results since April 11, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Sales have risen 5 percent for the
group and exceeded estimates at 72 percent of the companies.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.5 percent today to 1,337.38, less
than 0.5 percent below its high for the year set on Feb. 18. The
gauge rose 1.3 percent over the past four sessions, snapping a
two-week losing streak.  Apple gained 2.4 percent and Morgan Stanley advanced 1.7
percent.  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  rallied 3 percent as the biggest maker of
mobile-phone chips reported earnings that topped analysts’
estimates, while Exxon Mobil Corp. and Freeport-McMoran Copper &
Gold Inc. paced gains in commodity producers.  U.S. equities briefly pared gains after the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index dropped to 18.5,
the lowest level since November and trailing economists’
estimates, from 43.4 the prior month which was the highest level
since 1984.  Treasuries capped a second weekly gain as the Philadelphia
Fed report triggered concern the economic recovery may falter.
The 10-year yield lost one basis point to 3.40 percent.  Economic Data  Jobless claims decreased by 13,000 to 403,000 in the week
ended April 16, Labor Department figures showed. Economists
projected a decline to 390,000, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of people on unemployment
benefit rolls and those receiving extended payments declined.  The index of U.S. leading indicators rose for a ninth month
in March, signaling higher fuel costs will fail to derail the
expansion. The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the
next three to six months rose 0.4 percent.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 0.5 percent as two shares
rose for every one that fell.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the world’s largest
paintmaker, climbed 4 percent on better-than-estimated earnings.
 William Hill Plc (WMH)  surged 7.5 percent as the bookmaker reported
increased sales and operating profit. Royal KPN NV slid 8.3
percent as the biggest Dutch phone company cut its 2011
forecast.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained 0.9 percent to
1,206, the highest level since June 2008, as benchmark stock
indexes in  Taiwan  and  South Korea  jumped more than 1.3 percent.  The S&P GSCI index of 24 commodities advanced 0.5 percent.
Silver rose as much as 5 percent to $46.66 an ounce, the highest
price since January 1980, and gold futures jumped to an all-time
high of $1,509.60 an ounce.  Dollar Weakens  The dollar weakened against all but three of its 16 most-
traded counterparts. It depreciated 0.7 percent against the
pound and slid as much as 1.1 percent versus the Swiss franc,
reaching the weakest level since at least 1971. Sweden’s krona
climbed as much as 0.9 percent against the dollar, reaching its
strongest level in more than 2 1/2 years.  Greek and Portugal bond yields surged to records, along
with the cost to insure the nation’s debt from default, amid
speculation divisions are deepening within Europe over how to
resolve the sovereign-debt crisis. The yield on the two-year
Greek note climbed as much as 131 basis points to 23.33 percent,
the highest since before the euro was introduced in 1999.  Credit-default swaps protecting Greek sovereign debt jumped
40 basis points to 1,340 basis points, according to CMA,
signaling a 68 percent chance of default within five years. The
extra yield investors demand to hold Portuguese 10-year bonds
instead of benchmark German bunds jumped 27 basis points to 624
basis points, the most since at least 1997.  To contact the reporters on this story:
