Russia â€™s monthly flour exports
reached the highest level in more than three years in March,
SovEcon, an agricultural market research company, said on its
 website  today.  Russia exported 67,000 metric tons of flour in March, the
largest monthly amount since December 2007 when 59,000 tons were
sent overseas, the Moscow-based researcher said.  Flour exports, which were banned from Aug. 15 to Jan. 1,
have become more attractive as domestic grain prices have fallen
to the point where they are about $150 a ton lower than world
prices, SovEcon said.  There is a temporary export ban on wheat, barley, rye and
corn until at least July 1 in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
