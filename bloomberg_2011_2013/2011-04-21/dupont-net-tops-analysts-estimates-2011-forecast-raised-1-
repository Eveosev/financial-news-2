DuPont Co., the world’s largest
producer of titanium-dioxide pigment, raised its 2011 earnings
forecast and posted first-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates after prices of the white colorant gained.  Net income climbed 27 percent to $1.43 billion, or $1.52 a
share, from $1.13 billion, or $1.24, a year earlier, Wilmington,
Delaware-based DuPont said today in a statement. That topped the
$1.37 average estimate of 12 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Net
sales advanced 18 percent to $10 billion from $8.48 billion.  Full-year earnings will be $3.65 to $3.85 a share, compared
with a previous prediction of $3.45 to $3.75. DuPont reiterated
that its planned acquisition of Danisco A/S may cut 2011 profit
by as much as 45 cents a share.  DuPont has exceeded estimates in each of the nine quarters
Chief Executive Officer  Ellen Kullman  has been in charge, even
as expiring drug patents cut pharmaceutical royalties. Profit
climbed 21 percent at the agriculture unit and more than doubled
at the performance-chemicals business. The market for titanium
dioxide, a key paint ingredient, is still “tight,” said P.J.
Juvekar, a New York-based analyst at Citigroup Global Markets.  “Producers have announced two rounds of price increases so
far this year,” Juvekar, who recommends buying DuPont shares,
said in an April 18 report. “Industry utilization rates remain
high headed into the spring painting season.”  DuPont on Jan. 9 agreed to pay 31.7 billion-krone ($6.17
billion) to acquire Copenhagen-based Danisco, the world’s
biggest producer of food additives and the second-largest maker
of industrial enzymes, which are used in the production of
biofuels. The deal, which requires the support of Danisco
investors holding 90 percent of shares, should be completed this
month, DuPont said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
