Lithuania’s budget deficit narrowed
to 7.1 percent of gross domestic product last year as austerity
measures pushed the shortfall below the government’s target.  The gap was trimmed from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2009, the
Vilnius-based  statistics office  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The government’s 2010 budget plan forecast a shortfall of
9.5 percent of GDP.  Government debt widened to 38.2 percent of GDP last year
from 29.5 percent the previous year, the statistics office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
