Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or fuel oil, rose to the highest in more than seven months, data
from a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, gained 7.7
percent to 23 million barrels in the seven days to April 20,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Stockpiles were at the highest since Sept. 8, when they
reached 23.3 million barrels.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 5.5 percent to 11 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline rose 6.2
percent to 12.4 million barrels.  Losses from making  fuel oil  in  Asia  increased the most in
two weeks as refiners raised processing runs, boosting supplies.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 24 percent this
week to $12.95 a barrel at 2:29 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates, a London-based broker. Weekly losses grew
the most since April 8.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
