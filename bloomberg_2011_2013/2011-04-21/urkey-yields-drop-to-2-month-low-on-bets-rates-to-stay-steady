Turkish bond yields fell to the
lowest level in two months as the central bank’s decision to
keep rates at a record low fueled speculation it won’t raise
borrowing costs before general elections in June.  Yields on two-year benchmark lira bonds fell 29 basis
points to 8.33 percent at 5:30 p.m., the lowest level since Feb.
21. The main ISE National 100 share index climbed 0.8 percent to
68,565.63, the highest in two weeks. The lira rose 0.1 percent
to 1.5178 per dollar.  The central bank left its benchmark rate at a record of
6.25 percent in a decision published on its web site today. It
also scaled back increases in  reserve requirements  for lira
deposits of up to one month, lifting the ratio by 1 percentage
point to 16 percent. It was the fourth increase in six months.  “There will be probably no change in the policy mix now
until the elections and our call is that the bank will hold
rates,” Ugursel Onder, a fixed income analyst at Is Invest in
Istanbul, said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Turkish central bank governor Erdem Basci is trying to slow
economic growth without raising the benchmark interest rate and
drawing in short-term capital. Since January, the bank has held
the rate at the lowest since the country began inflation
targeting in 2002, and raised the reserves banks must set aside,
reducing money available to lend to the domestic economy.  The additional increase in reserves this month is “a very
decisive move and timely,”  Tevfik Aksoy , London-based head of
emerging market economics for the region at Morgan Stanley, said
in a telephone interview.  Obligations  The central bank last increased reserves on lira deposits
on March 23, raising the rate to 15 percent from 10 percent. The
move pushed bond yields up the most in 16 months as banks sold
assets to meet the heavier obligations.  In its decision today, the central bank also increased the
ratio on reserves for foreign currency deposits of up to one
year by 1 percentage point to 12 percent.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS) , the country’s sole
refiner, rose 1.2 lira, or 2.6 percent, to 48.20 liras, leading
gainers on the stock market.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , part-owned by  Spain ’s second-
biggest bank  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , increased 8
kurus, or 1 percent, to 7.78 liras. Garanti sold 750 million
liras of 176-day bonds at an annual yield of 8.59 percent, the
company told the exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
