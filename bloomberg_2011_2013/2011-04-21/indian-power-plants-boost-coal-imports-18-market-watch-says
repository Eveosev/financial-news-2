India ’s coal-fired power plants
increased imports of the fuel by 18 percent in the year ended
March, boosted by purchases from state-run NTPC Ltd., India Coal
Market Watch said, citing an unidentified government official.  Imports rose to 29.1 million metric tons from 24.6 million
a year earlier, the coal newsletter said. This compares with a
government target of 35 million tons set by the Central
Electricity Authority.  NTPC imported 10.57 million tons during that period, up 68
percent from a year earlier, according to the newsletter. That’s
3.3 million tons below the government’s target for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
