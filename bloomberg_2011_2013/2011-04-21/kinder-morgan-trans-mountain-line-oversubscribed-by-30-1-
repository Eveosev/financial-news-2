Kinder Morgan Partners LP said May
shipment requests for its Trans Mountain pipeline, which moves
crude and refined products to the western coasts of the U.S. and
 Canada , exceeded capacity by 30 percent.  Subscriptions on the portion of the system delivering to
refineries in British Columbia and Washington were 43 percent
over capacity, the Houston-based company said in a bulletin to
shippers.  The Trans Mountain mainline system is expected to carry
280,980 barrels a day in May, down 9.5 percent from estimated
April shipments of 310,371, according to the notices received
today and March 22.  The Puget Sound pipeline system will ship 156,213 barrels a
day next month. The Puget Sound system will not be apportioned
in May, according to the bulletin.  The 715-mile (1,150-kilometer) line runs from Edmonton,
Alberta, to marketing terminals and refineries in central
British Columbia, the Vancouver area and the Puget Sound region
in  Washington , according to the company’s website.  Nominations for “advanced timing” shipments to the
Westridge dock were oversubscribed by 10 percent and shipments
for regular timing were apportioned by 100 percent, according to
the bulletin.  Products also are moved to  California , the U.S. Gulf Coast
and overseas through the Westridge marine terminal in Burnaby,
British Columbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
