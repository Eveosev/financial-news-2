OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, a Russian
miner with production north of the Artic Circle, is considering
mining copper and nickel in Voronezh region, central  Russia .  Norilsk is asking the government to tender rights for
unallocated subsoil reserves, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. Norilsk had already planned to invest 2.7
billion rubles ($97 million) by 2018 on exploration, it said.  Once exploration is completed, Norilsk may seek to build a
processing plant with capacity of 2 million to 5 million metric
tons of ore a year at the Elansk and Elkinsk deposits. It would
make copper-nickel pellets that could be further refined at the
companyâ€™s facilities in Murmansk, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
