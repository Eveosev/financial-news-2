BB&T Corp. (BBT) , the ninth-largest  U.S.
bank  by deposits, may issue debt or stock as part of a plan to
retire $3.2 billion in trust-preferred securities. The stock
fell the most since May after the lender reported a drop in
revenue.  BB&T plans to buy back all of its $3.2 billion in trust-
preferred stock because TruPs can’t be counted as capital under
the New Dodd-Frank Act regulations starting in 2013, the
Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based bank said today in a
statement. The lender will likely issue debt or preferred stock,
John Pancari, an analyst at New York-based Evercore Partners
Inc., said in an interview.  BB&T said first-quarter net income increased 20 percent to
$225 million, or 32 cents a share, from $188 million, or 27
cents, a year earlier. The bank cut its loan-loss provision by
41 percent from the year-earlier quarter, according to the
statement. Revenue was $2 billion, down from $2.16 billion in
the same period last year.  BB&T fell 61 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $25.98 at 4:03 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
declined as much as 4.9 percent earlier today, the most since
May.  “All of the banks this earnings season have been getting
crushed by the lack of revenue growth,” Pancari said. “Credit
improvement has become a foregone improvement.”
