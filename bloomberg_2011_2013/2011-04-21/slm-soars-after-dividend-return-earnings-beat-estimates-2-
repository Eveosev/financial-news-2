SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as  Sallie Mae , soared to the most in more than two years after
declaring its first dividend since 2007 and raising earnings
estimates.  SLM increased 2011 guidance for earnings-per-share 20 cents
to $1.70 on a conference call with investors and analysts today.
The company declared a quarterly dividend of 10 cents per share
after the close of regular trading yesterday and also authorized
buying back as much as $300 million of outstanding common stock.  The lender, which has jumped 30 percent in 2011, is seeking
to raise its credit rating to reduce borrowing costs almost two
years after Moody’s Investors Service cut the ranking to junk
after the government stopped using private lenders to make loans
through the Federal Family Education Loan Program, or FFELP.
SLM’s Chief Executive Officer Albert Lord is increasing student
lending without federal guarantees and taking advantage of
improved capital markets.  “With the stock buyback and also the reinstatement of the
dividend, the company is putting its money where its mouth is,”
said Brian Charles, an analyst at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in  New
York .  Newark, Delaware-based SLM rose $1.85, or 13 percent, to
$16.31 as of 4:01 p.m. in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, the highest level since September 2008.  Buyout Collapsed  The shares fell to as low as $3.19 in March 2009 amid the
financial crisis, which froze SLM out of the bond markets it
relies on for funding. The stock plunged from $57.98 in July
2007 after a buyout led by J.C. Flowers & Co. collapsed, in part
because Congress passed a measure cutting subsidies to student-
loan providers.  The U.S. eliminated private lenders from the FFELP program
in legislation aimed at protecting student loans from turmoil in
financial markets. The measure became law as part of President
Barack Obama’s health-care overhaul in March 2010. All federal
college loans are now originated by the government directly.  SLM originated $940 million in  student loans  without
government guarantees during the quarter, up 12 percent from
$840 million in the year-earlier period, according to the
statement. Applications for not-for-profit, four-year schools
increased 8 percent this quarter compared with the same period
for the prior year, the company said.  Asset-Backed Bonds  The lender sold $562 million in bonds backed by private
student loans, its first “broadly marketed” deal of its type
since the first quarter of 2007, said Jonathan Clark, the
company’s chief financial officer, on a conference call today
with investors and analysts.  Companies have raised $4.1 billion of bonds tied to student
loans in 2011, compared with about $6 billion at this point last
year, according to a Citigroup Inc. report today. Last week was
the busiest for asset-backed issuance this year, taking the
total for 2011 to $34.3 billion, the New York-based bank wrote
in the report.  SLM also issued $2 billion of 6.25 percent notes due in
2016 in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
securities fell 0.125 cent to 105.375 cents on the dollar to
yield 2.86 percentage points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries as of 12:15 p.m. in New York, according to Trace, the
bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  Moody’s ranks SLM Ba1 and  Standard & Poor’s  rates its debt
BBB-, one level higher.  “While we are very comfortable with our maturity profile
and pleased with the outcome of these most recent transactions,
we will not be fully satisfied until we see our credit ratings
and our funding cost improve significantly,” Clark said.  Net income fell to $175 million, or 32 cents a share, from
$240 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, SLM said. Its core
earnings were 48 cents a share, compared with an average
estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg of 41 cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
