The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  Results from the Business Outlook Survey suggest that regional
manufacturing activity continued to grow in April but at a
slower pace than in March.  Nearly all of the survey’s broadest
indicators remained positive but fell from their readings in the
previous month.  Increases in input prices continue to be
widespread, and a significant percentage of firms reported
increases in prices for their own manufactured goods.  The
survey’s indicators of future activity fell notably this month;
however, most firms expect continued growth over the next six
months.  Indicators Suggest Slower Growth  The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the
diffusion index of current activity, decreased from 43.4 in
March to 18.5 this month (see Chart).  The demand for
manufactured goods, as measured by the current new orders index,
showed a similar slowing: The index fell 22 points, following
seven consecutive months of increase. The shipments index
declined 6 points and remained at a relatively high level.
Firms continued to report that unfilled orders and delivery
times were still rising.  FirmsEresponses continue to indicate overall improvement in
labor markets. The current employment index fell 6 points but
has remained positive for eight consecutive months. The
percentage of firms reporting an increase in employment (20
percent) is higher than the percentage reporting a decline (8
percent). Over twice as many firms reported a longer workweek
(32 percent) than reported a shorter one (14 percent) and the
workweek index increased 5 points.  Firms Report Higher Output Prices  Firms continue to report price increases for inputs as well as
their own manufactured goods. The prices paid index declined 7
points this month but remains about 45 points higher than
readings just seven months ago.  Fifty-nine percent of the firms
reported higher prices for inputs this month, compared to 64
percent last month.  On balance, firms also reported an increase
in prices for their own manufactured goods: The prices received
index increased 5 points and has steadily increased over the
last eight months.  Thirty percent of firms reported higher
prices for their own goods this month; just 3 percent reported
price reductions.  Six-Month Indicators Fall  The future general activity index decreased 29 points this month,
its lowest reading since last September (see Chart). The indexes
for future new orders and shipments also declined, decreasing 31
and 22 points, respectively.  The index for future employment
continued to be a bright spot and still reflects optimism about
expected expansion in the manufacturing sector. The future
employment index increased 7 points. More firms expect to
increase employment over the next six months (45 percent) than
expect to decrease employment (7 percent).  In special questions this month, firms were asked about their
export business and expectations for growth for the remainder of
the year (see Special Questions).  The average firm in the
survey’s reporting group exports approximately 12 percent of its
output.  Among the firms that export, about 40 percent expect
the share of products for export to increase.  Firms were also
asked about any adverse effects of the recent crisis in  Japan  or
other international events on the availability of raw materials
or other products. The largest percentage of firms (80 percent)
indicated no effect; 10 percent indicated some current adverse
effects; and 10 percent cited possible future effects.  Summary  According to respondents to the April Business Outlook Survey,
the region’s manufacturing sector continued to expand this month
but at a slower pace than over the previous several months. Most
of the survey’s broad indicators fell this month but continued
to signal expansion. A majority of firms continue to cite price
pressures, and a significant share of firms reported higher
prices for their own manufactured goods again this month.
Indicators for future activity fell notably this month but still
suggest that firms expect the current expansion in manufacturing
to continue over the next six months.  Special Questions (April 2011)  1. Approximately what percentage of your manufacturing output is
for export? Mean:  11.7%* Median:                    5.0%
Number of Respondents:    89.0  2. Over the remainder of this year, do you expect the share of
products you export to: **  Increase Substantially     1.4% Increase Moderately       38.4%
Stay the Same             56.1% Decrease Moderately        2.7%
Decrease Substantially     1.4%  3. Have recent developments in Japan or other international
events had any adverse effects on the availability of raw
materials or other intermediate products for you or any of your
customers?  None                        80% Some Current Effects        10%
Possible Future Effects     10%  * About 34 percent of all reporting firms indicated they do not
export. **Responses include only those firms that export.
