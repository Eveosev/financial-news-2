Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) , the London-listed
explorer focused on  Turkmenistan , plans to increase production
as much as 20 percent this year, more than previously forecast,
on extra pipeline export capacity from fields.  Oil output rose to 57,800 barrels a day in the first
quarter, up from 47,600 barrels a day in the same period last
year, the company said today in a statement. Production rose
after two new wells were started in March.  “We are continuing to monitor the field performance and
flow rates following the transition over to the new integrated
system,” Dragon said. “We maintain our medium-term target of
10 percent to 15 percent growth on average per annum in
2011-2013.”  Dragon in January forecast output growth would exceed 15
percent this year. Average production climbed 5.5 percent to
47,211 barrels of oil a day last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
