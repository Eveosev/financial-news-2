Iranians who receive government
grants aimed at easing the impact of cuts in fuel subsidies are
now getting 2.25 percent more.  The payments are now 455,000 rials ($43) a month, an
increase of 10,000 rials, and were deposited in bank accounts
today, the state-run  Fars  news agency said.  Iran , which is grappling with international economic and
sanctions over its nuclear program, in December started a five-
year plan to eliminate subsidies on fuel, electricity and basic
consumer goods. Payments to compensate for the plan’s
inflationary repercussions were previously made bimonthly.  About 60 million Iranians, or some 80 percent of the
population, signed up for the program to receive cash, the
country’s Economy and  Finance Ministry  said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
