Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR)  jumped to the
highest price in more than three years after saying it plans to
divest the Hussmann refrigerated display-case business acquired
in 2000.  Talks are under way with a “number of purchasers,” the
company said today in a statement. Chief Executive Officer
Michael Lamach declined to identify them and said in an
interview that a deal probably will close in July.  Ingersoll-Rand, the maker of Trane air conditioners, added
food display cases and commercial refrigerators when it bought
Hussmann in May 2000. The unit, which the company said it
acquired for $1.6 billion, has about 3,400 employees and
five manufacturing facilities, and had 2010 revenue of about
$800 million, according to the statement.  “The performance has lagged the other businesses in the
portfolio,” James Lucas, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
LLC in Philadelphia, said in a note to clients today. He rates
Swords, Ireland-based Ingersoll- Rand  as “buy.”  Proceeds from the sale would speed share repurchases, the
company said. Ingersoll Rand rose $1.20, or 2.5 percent, to
$50.03 at 3:39 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. Earlier, the stock touched $50.83 for the highest
intraday price since December 2007.  Disposing of Hussmann probably will reduce full-year profit
by 10 cents to 12 cents a share, Lamach said on a conference
call. Analysts had projected adjusted 2011 earnings of $3.07 a
share, the average of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Best Interest’  “We concluded that although the business has substantial
margin expansion potential, it was in the best interest of
Hussmann and of Ingersoll Rand to look at strategic alternatives
for Hussmann,” said Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-
Rand in an e-mail.  The divestiture will let Ingersoll-Rand focus on its main
businesses and help move toward an earnings-per-share target of
between $5 and $5.75 in 2013, Lamach said in the interview.  Talks are “at the final end of the process,” and
Ingersoll-Rand aims to announce a definitive buyer “sometime
within the next month,” he said. Lamach, who has been CEO since
February 2010, called the divestiture a difficult decision.  “It’s an 80-year-old brand that still today has a lot of
cachet with folks in that business,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
