China ’s overnight money-market rate
jumped the most in three months as this year’s fourth increase
in lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios took effect today,
draining cash from the financial system.  The one-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose to the highest level since Feb. 9
even as the central bank reined in debt issuance. The People’s
Bank of China sold the least amount of three-month bills in
seven weeks at an auction today and held off from offering 91-
day repurchase agreements for the first time in more than two
months.  “Banks are short of money after handing reserve-ratio
payments to the central bank,” said  Jiang Chao , a bond analyst
in  Shanghai  at Guotai Junan Securities Co., the nation’s biggest
brokerage by revenue. “The effect may be short-term because
it’s not driven by speculation about more tightening measures.”  The overnight repo climbed 178 basis points, or 1.78
percentage point, to 3.55 percent as of 11:02 a.m. in Shanghai,
the biggest jump since Jan. 20, according to a weighted average
rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. The
benchmark seven-day repo jumped 94 basis points to 3.94 percent,
the biggest increase since Feb. 21.  The central bank sold 10 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of
three-month bills at a yield of 2.9168 percent, unchanged for a
second week, according to traders at primary dealers required to
bid at the auctions. The monetary authority injected a net 94
billion yuan of capital to the  debt market  this week, compared
with a withdrawal of 83 billion yuan in the five days through
April 15, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial
Bank Co. in Shanghai.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose four basis
points to 3.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.6 percent government bond due February
2016 gained one basis point to 3.46 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editor: James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
