Turkey’s lira rallied to the
highest in almost a week against the dollar as better-than-
expected profit at U.S. companies boosted risk appetite and
before a meeting where the central bank may keep rates on hold.  The lira strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.5154 per dollar at
11:09 a.m. in Istanbul. Yields on two-year benchmark debt
dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.57
percent, the RBS Istanbul benchmark bond index showed. The  ISE
National 100 Index (XU100)  advanced 0.2 percent to 68,161.29.  Apple Inc.’s earnings more than doubled, signaling consumer
demand is intact and boosting the global economic outlook. The
central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will hold the one-week
repo rate at 6.25 percent, according to all 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank will announce its decision at 2
p.m. in Ankara today.  “I am still bullish on lira and target 1.45 in two
months,”  Benoit Anne , head of global emerging markets strategy
at Societe Generale SA, France’s second-largest bank, said by e-
mail from  London .  Central banks from Thailand to  Brazil  have lifted  interest
rates  this week, while the U.S. Federal Reserve is forecast to
maintain stimulus amid prospects for a weak recovery in the
world’s largest economy.  Turkey ’s central bank will raise the benchmark interest
rate to 6.75 percent in the final quarter of 2011, according to
the average estimate of seven banks surveyed by Bloomberg. The
lira’s forecasted total return of 4.3 percent against the dollar
in the third quarter will be second only to a 5.6 percent
advance in Peru’s sol among 22 emerging-market currencies ranked
by Bloomberg.  “Our big call is that we are going to see more tightening
by the central bank over the next few months,” Benoit said.
“We have 100 basis points of hikes earmarked for this year,
including a 50 basis-point hike in June.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
