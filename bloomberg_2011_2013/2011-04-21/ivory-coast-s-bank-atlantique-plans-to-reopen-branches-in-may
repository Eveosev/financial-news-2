Bank Atlantique ’s  Ivory Coast  unit,
the West African nation’s second-biggest lender, is likely to
restart operations in the country in May, said Souleymane
Diarrassouba, the director-general of the bank.  “We would like to reopen with as little delay as possible,”
he said by phone April 19. Lenders may decide to remain closed
until the “security situation is resolved,” he said.  Violence following disputed presidential elections forced
most of the banks in the world’s top cocoa-producing country to
shut down in February.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , Citigroup Inc.,
BNP Paribas, Ecobank Transnational Inc. and Attijariwafa Bank
all closed their branches.  The reopening plans come after the April 11 capture of
 Laurent Gbagbo , the president who ruled for a decade and refused
to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally
recognized winner of the Nov. 28 vote.  Reviving the banking system is a “key element” to
restarting cocoa exports from Ivory Coast, Cargill Inc. said
April 12. Ouattara lifted a ban on the two key ports of San
Pedro and Abidjan and they resumed normal operations on April
18.  “We’re putting everything in place to secure the banks,”
army commander Issiaka Ouattara said by phone April 19. Ouattara
“has asked us to make security our priority so economic
activities can resume,” he said.  United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a Nigerian lender with
operations in several countries in the continent, said it will
resume business in Ivory Coast on May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
