Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Kevin Sharer outlined a plan to boost earnings by as
much as 11 percent annually through 2015 by turning bone drug
denosumab into a $3 billion to $4 billion a year product.  The company was “severely tested” in 2007 and 2008 when
reports emerged that patients taking its top-selling anemia
drugs were experiencing strokes and cancer, Sharer said. Amgen
has made it through that in a “superb way” and is now poised
for growth, Sharer said in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
