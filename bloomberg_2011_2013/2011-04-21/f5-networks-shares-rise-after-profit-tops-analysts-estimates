F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) , a Seattle-based
maker of software used for managing  computer networks , climbed
7.2 percent after fiscal second-quarter profit topped estimates,
buoyed by the growth of cloud computing.  F5 Networks shares jumped $7.13 to $106.87 at 4 p.m. in New
York trading. The company reported earnings yesterday after the
close of trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The company’s shares have advanced 60 percent in the past
12 months amid optimism it will benefit as Web traffic rises and
as more companies shift to so-called cloud computing, or the
delivery of software, storage and computing power over the
Internet. F5 forecast profit of as much as 91 cents a share for
the third quarter, compared with the 90-cent average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  “Reporting an in-line revenue quarter with better EPS due
to lower operating expenses and guidance that’s relatively in-
line looks better than the market expected,” Alkesh Shah, an
analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in  New York , said in an e-
mail.  Excluding certain costs, second-quarter profit rose to
$71.5 million, or 88 cents a share, from $45.2 million, or 56
cents, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
statement. Sales in the period, which ended March 31, increased
35 percent to $277.6 million. Analysts on average predicted
profit of 85 cents on revenue of $277.3 million.  Second-quarter net income rose 68 percent to $55.6 million,
or 68 cents a share, from $33.1 million, or 41 cents, a year
earlier, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
