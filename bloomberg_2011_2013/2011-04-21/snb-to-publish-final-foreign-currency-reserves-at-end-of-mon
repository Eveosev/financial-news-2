The  Swiss National Bank  said it
will start publishing final figures for foreign currency
reserves on the last working day of every month.  Final figures for March and the distribution of foreign
currency holdings for the first quarter will be published on
April 29, the central bank said in its  monthly statistical
bulletin  today. That will replace the preliminary figures that
were previously released on the 21st of each month, it said.  The central bank will continue to publish international
reserves and foreign-currency liquidity data, in line with
International Monetary Fund standards, on the fourth, 14th and
last working day of the month, according to the  SNBâ€™s website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
