Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as farmers held remaining supplies from last year’s
harvest for higher prices. The soybean basis was steady.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 55 cents to 60 cents a bushel above May futures,
compared with 54 cents to 60 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. Bids rose 2 cents for May delivery. The
soybean basis for April deliveries was unchanged at 64 cents to
68 cents a bushel.  “Farmers don’t have much of last year’s crops left to
sell,” said  Dave Marshall , a market analyst for Toay Commodity
Futures Group LLC in Nashville, Illinois. “Whoever does own the
supplies is in no hurry to sell because they expect to see
higher prices.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.3725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Soybean futures for May delivery jumped 22.75 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $13.805 a bushel on the CBOT, the highest settlement
for the contract since April 8.  Seven Mississippi River locks in Iowa and  Illinois  are
closed because of flooding, the USDA Agricultural Marketing
Service said today in a  report .  Barge shipments of grain and soybeans rose 12 percent to
563,000 metric tons in the week ended April 16 from a year
earlier, the USDA said. On April 10, the cost of moving grain by
barge from  St. Louis  to New Orleans was quoted at 300 percent of
1976 published tariff rates, down from 314 percent a week
earlier and the lowest since August, the USDA said.  “The drop in the barge freight was bid back into grain
prices this week,” Marshall said. “Barge operators prepared
for the Mississippi River closing by keeping tows and boats
below the flooded region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
