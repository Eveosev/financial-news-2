Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN) , the
operator of 25 casinos and racetracks, raised its 2011 profit
and revenue forecasts, and said it expects to take ownership of
the  M Resort  in  Las Vegas  in June.  Full-year profit will rise to $1.64 a share, up from the
$1.48 forecast in February, the Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts projected $1.54, the
average of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Peter Carlino said in
the statement that  consumer spending  has stabilized across the
company’s businesses. Penn is building casinos in Ohio and
Kansas, expanding through acquisitions in Texas and Nevada and
adding to its existing locations as states allow more gambling
to boost  tax revenue .  Penn said operating results will include the acquisition of
the M Resort Spa Casino in June, after buying the Las Vegas
property’s debt at a discount last year. Penn gains a casino
about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the  Las Vegas Strip  for
a fraction of the almost $1 billion the 390-room resort cost to
build.  Revenue for 2011 will rise to $2.71 billion, up from a
prior forecast of $2.69 billion, Penn said. Analysts projected
$2.72 billion, the average of 18 estimates.  Penn rose 52 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.34 yesterday in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares had gained 6.2 percent
this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
