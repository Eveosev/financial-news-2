Iraq aims to more than double crude
export capacity to 5 million barrels a day next year by
expanding facilities, Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said.  “Iraq plans to raise export capacity to 10 million barrels
a day in the long run, in parallel with a gradual increase in
production,” he said in an e-mailed statement.  The country, home to the world’s third-largest crude
reserves, is struggling to lure foreign investment and expertise
to help ramp up oil exports and rebuild infrastructure shattered
by years of conflict, economic sanctions and sabotage.  Iraqi oil exports in March averaged 2.195 million barrels a
day at $106.50 a barrel, generating $7.1 billion in revenue,
Falah al-Amri, the head of the State Oil Marketing Organization,
said April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
