Sugar rose for a second day on
signs that  Brazil , the world’s biggest grower and exporter, will
reduce cane output and increase ethanol production. Cocoa fell,
while cotton gained.  Almost all the sugar cane processed last week was used to
make biofuel, according to Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo
research group. The risk of crop damage from frost has increased
in Brazil with the weakening of the La Nina weather pattern, an
agronomist at the Somar Meteorologia said on March 28. Prices
are up 43 percent in the past year.  “The market is bullish, and I expect the price to continue
to rally,” said  Jimmy Tintle , an analyst at Transworld Futures
in Tampa.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.27 cent, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at 23.8 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The contract has dropped 3.6 percent this week. The market
will be closed tomorrow for the Good Friday holiday.  In  London , refined-sugar futures for August delivery rose
40 cents, or 0.1 percent to $639.10 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa futures for July delivery fell $18, or 0.6 percent,
to settle at $3,088 a ton in New York.  Cotton futures for July delivery advanced 0.45 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.6751 a pound on ICE.  -- Editors: Millie Munshi, Steve Stroth  To contact the reporter on this story:
