Poland ’s decision to convert funds
from the European Union in the currency market is unlikely to
stop policy makers from raising interest rates in May,  RBC
Capital Markets  said.  Poland’s central bank will probably increase its main
interest rate to 4.25 percent when policy makers next meet on
May 11 from 4 percent today, Nigel Rendell, a London-based RBC
strategist for emerging markets, wrote in a report today.  “Today’s announcement that the Polish authorities will
implement regular sales of EU funds into the zloty does not
alter the near-term interest-rate outlook,” Rendell wrote.
“The National Bank of Poland will tackle inflationary pressures
through a combination of higher interest rates and ideally, in
their view, a stronger zloty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
