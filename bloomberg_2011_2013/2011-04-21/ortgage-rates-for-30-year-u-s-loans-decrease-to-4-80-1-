Mortgage rates  for 30-year fixed
U.S. home loans fell for the first time in five weeks,
decreasing borrowing costs as all-cash buyers make up a growing
share of the housing market.  The average 30-year rate dropped to 4.80 percent in the
week ended today from 4.91 percent, according to  Freddie Mac .
The 15-year rate averaged 4.02 percent, down from 4.13 percent a
week ago, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company
said in a statement.  The housing market is under pressure from unemployment near
9 percent, stricter loan rules and mounting foreclosures. Sales
are strongest for homes below $100,000, reflecting increased
demand from investors,  Lawrence Yun , chief economist for the
National Association of Realtors, said yesterday in  Washington .  Sales of existing homes increased 3.7 percent in March,
with all-cash deals accounting for 35 percent of transactions,
the highest since monthly tracking began in August 2008,
according to Yun. Distressed properties, which include
foreclosures and short sales, made up 40 percent of all deals.  Mortgage applications climbed 5.3 percent in the week ended
April 15, according to the  Mortgage Bankers Association . The
Washington-based groupâ€™s measure of refinancing gained 2.7
percent, while its index of purchases rose 10 percent.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is below where it
was last year at this time, when it averaged 5.07 percent,
according to Freddie Mac. It hit a record low of 4.17 percent in
November.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
