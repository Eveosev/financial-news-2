U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains as earnings at Apple Inc., General Electric Co. and Morgan
Stanley overshadowed higher-than-forecast jobless claims.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
increased 0.4 percent to 1,333.7 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York . Dow
Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 36 points, or 0.3
percent, to 12,432.  Jobless claims decreased by 13,000 to 403,000 in the week
ended April 16, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Economists projected a decline to 390,000, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of
people on unemployment benefit rolls and those receiving
extended payments declined.  Stocks rallied  yesterday, sending the Dow to its highest
level since June 2008, as sales at companies from  Intel Corp . to
Yahoo! Inc. exceeded estimates and commodity producers gained.  Earnings-per-share have beaten analysts’ estimates at 76
percent of the 101 companies in the  S&P 500  that have reported
results since April 11, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies in the index have topped estimates for eight straight
quarters, the longest streak since at least 2006, helping propel
the gauge up 97 percent from the market bottom on March 9, 2009,
Bloomberg data show.  The index of U.S. leading economic indicators probably
increased for a ninth month in March, signaling higher fuel
costs will fail to derail the expansion, economists said before
a report today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
