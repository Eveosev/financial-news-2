JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  will settle
claims against it brought by  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s
brokerage by returning $800 million in cash and securities,
according to court papers.  The defunct brokerage,  Lehman Brothers Inc ., will
distribute the money to customers, according to a filing
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  JPMorgan was the main clearing bank for the Lehman
brokerage, processing billions of dollars of transactions and
lending tens of billions of dollars daily to LBI, according to
the filing. While some of the loans were secured by securities
in the brokerage’s accounts, the bank didn’t have a valid lien
on some customer property, which now is being returned, it said.  “The agreement will have no material financial impact on
JPMorgan,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Most of the assets were set aside to await a resolution of
claims by the trustee who is liquidating the remnants of
Lehman’s brokerage, it said.  Separately, JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is
trying to get an $8.6 billion lawsuit by the Lehman parent
dismissed.  The brokerage bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers
Inc., 08-01420,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
