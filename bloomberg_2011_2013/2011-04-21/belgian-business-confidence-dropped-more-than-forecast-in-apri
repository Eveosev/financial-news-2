Belgian business confidence dropped
more than economists forecast in April, led by a deterioration
of demand expectations as executives in the manufacturing and
construction industries signaled slowing orders.  The confidence index for  Belgium  declined to 2.8 from 6.2
in March, when it reached the highest level since July 2007, the
 National Bank of Belgium  in Brussels said today in an e-mailed
statement. Economists expected a drop to 5.6, according to the
median of 16 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Belgian business confidence decreased for the first time in
10 months as rising energy prices threaten to curb  consumer
spending  and German business confidence fell for a second month
in April. The consumer sentiment index for Belgium, the euro
region’s sixth-largest economy, had its steepest decline in 10
months in March and domestic gasoline prices climbed to a record
1.66 euros a liter ($9.17 a gallon) starting April 9, with
 diesel fuel  coming within one cent of its May 2008 high.  “Demand forecasts had deteriorated considerably,” the
central bank said in the statement. “The decline in confidence
among business leaders was reflected in each of the four
branches of activity surveyed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
