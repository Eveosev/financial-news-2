Chubb Corp. (CB) , the insurer of
commercial property and high-end homes, said first-quarter
profit rose 9.7 percent on reduced claims costs tied to natural
disasters and an increase in premium revenue.  Net income advanced to $509 million, or $1.70 a share, from
$464 million, or $1.39, a year earlier, the Warren, New Jersey-
based company said today in a statement. Operating profit, which
excludes some investment results, was $1.35 a share, beating the
$1.13 average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Chubb said that catastrophe losses, including claims from
U.S. winter storms, flooding in  Australia  and earthquakes in
 Japan  and New Zealand, fell to $270 million before tax in the
quarter from $344 million a year earlier. The insurer joins
rival Travelers Cos. in reporting a profit increase today as
policy sales rose.  “While the property and casualty market environment
remained competitive, net written premiums increased 3 percent
for the second consecutive quarter,” Chubb Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Finnegan said in the statement. “This is
a positive change from the flat to negative premium growth,
excluding the effect of currency fluctuation, that we
experienced during each of the past five calendar years.”  Chubb advanced 59 cents to $62.15 at 5:22 p.m. in extended
New York trading. It has climbed about 18 percent in the past
year compared with the 3 percent gain in the 24-company  KBW
Insurance Index. (KIX)   Premium Revenue  Premium revenue from property-casualty insurance rose to
$2.85 billion from $2.78 billion. Sales in the commercial
insurance segment advanced to $1.33 billion from $1.24 billion a
year earlier. Sales of home and auto coverage to individuals
climbed to $894 million from $874 million.  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose to
$53.26 a share from $52.24 at the end of last year.  Floods and a tropical cyclone in Australia cost the company
about $110 million, Chubb’s president of personal lines and
claims, Dino Robusto, said today on a conference call with
analysts. U.S. winter storms added $100 million in catastrophe
costs and the earthquakes in Japan and  New Zealand  during the
quarter accounted for another $60 million, he said.  Finnegan, 62, has been expanding operations abroad. About
26 percent of the insurer’s policy sales came from international
customers in 2010, compared with 23 percent a year earlier.  “Chubb has an international business that is growing and
important to the company and of significant size, whereas
Travelers is overwhelmingly a U.S.-focused insurance company,”
said Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP,
who has a “hold” rating on the stock.  Travelers, which got 5.7 percent of revenue last year from
outside the U.S., said today that first-quarter net income
surged to $839 million, or $1.92 a share, from $647 million, or
$1.25, a year earlier on an increase in policy sales and reduced
catastrophe costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
