UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the
largest U.S. insurer by sales, rose the most since 2009 in  New
York  trading after increasing its full-year forecast on higher
enrollment and a decline in the company’s medical spending.  UnitedHealth gained 8.1 percent, or $3.57, to $47.81 at
4:02 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
biggest jump since May 7, 2009. The Minnetonka, Minnesota-based
insurer said 2011 net income will be $3.95 to $4.05 a share,
more than a January forecast of as much as $3.70. First-quarter
earnings were 36 cents a share higher than the average estimate
of seven analysts.  UnitedHealth is the first of the major health insurers to
report earnings that include the impact of government-mandated
spending that kicks in this year. The health-care overhaul
requires managed-care companies to spend at least 80 percent of
revenue from premiums on care or rebate the difference.
UnitedHealth said it spent 81.4 percent in the first quarter.  “The impact of the new regulations was less than
expected,” said  Jason Gurda , an analyst at Leerink Swann & Co.
in New York. “This was also UnitedHealth’s best quarter for
investment income in 11 quarters.”  First-quarter net income rose 13 percent to $1.35 billion,
or $1.22 a share, from $1.19 billion, or $1.03, a year earlier,
the insurer said. Sales rose 9.7 percent to $25.4 billion,
topping analysts’ average estimate of $25 billion.  Industry Boost  Other managed-care company shares benefited from
UnitedHealth’s first-quarter report. The Standard and Poor’s 500
Managed Health Care Index jumped 5.5 percent, the highest since
July 28, 2009.  WellPoint Inc. (WLP)  of Indianapolis climbed $2.88 to $72.27;
 Aetna Inc. (AET)  of Hartford Connecticut rose $2.04 to $39.06; and
Philadelphia-based  Cigna Corp. (CI)  gained $1.41 to $45.29. WellPoint
is scheduled to report earnings on April 27; Aetna on April 28;
and Cigna on May 5.  UnitedHealth’s results beat estimates because of a
combination of the company’s “initial conservatism on its
outlook, strong enrollment gains and overall execution,” said
Matthew Borsch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New
York.  In January, Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said the
company would make adjustments to its forecasts after the first
quarter once it was clearer what the impact of the health-law
mandates would be and whether demand for medical services was
increasing.  Hemsley Comments  Today, Hemsley said on a conference call that “we see
expansive market opportunities opening in health benefits and
 health services .”  Enrollment at the end of the quarter rose 5.2 percent to
38.7 million from a year earlier, the company said. Membership
in managed-care plans sold to the government programs Medicare
for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid for low-income
Americans rose 8.1 percent.  UnitedHealth raised its outlook based on a 90 basis point
decline in the portion of premium revenue the company spent on
medical care in the quarter, said  Ana Gupte , an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York. “UnitedHealth is firing
on all cylinders of growth,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
