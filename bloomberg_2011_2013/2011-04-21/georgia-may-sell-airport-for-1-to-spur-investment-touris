Georgia  may sell the airport in
Kutaisi, the former Soviet republic’s second-largest city, for
$1 as it tries to attract foreign investment and boost tourism.  “We’re in talks on the airport with possible investors
from Germany,  India  and elsewhere,” Economy and Sustainable
Development Minister Vera Kobalia said by telephone from the
capital Tbilisi today. “One dollar is a symbolic price. We
expect $20 million to be invested in the facility.”  The government is considering all options for Kutaisi
airport, including selling or turning it over to an operating
company, Ketevan Aleksidze, director of Georgian United
Airports, said by telephone. The plan may involve attracting
low-cost airlines from  Europe  to Kutaisi.  Kopitnari Airport, located about 14 kilometers (9 miles)
from Kutaisi, currently handles an average of 200 passengers per
hour, according to the Economy and Sustainable Development
Ministry. It sits on 30.5 hectares of land and has 2,300 square
meters of buildings.  Airports serving Tbilisi and the Black Sea port of Batumi
are managed by Turkish operator  TAV Havalimanlari Holding AS. (TAVHL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
