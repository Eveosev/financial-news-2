The cost to protect against a
default by the  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  unit that guaranteed some of Wall
Street’s most toxic debt securities dropped for a fifth day as
Morgan Stanley’s chief financial officer said the bank hasn’t
closed out hedges that insure against an MBIA failure.  Five-year credit-default swaps on MBIA Insurance Corp. fell
1.25 percentage points to a mid-price of 29.75 percent upfront,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That’s in addition
to 5 percent a year, meaning it would cost
$2.975 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect
against losses on $10 million of MBIA obligations for five
years. They’ve dropped from about 40.6 percent upfront on April
14 and are down from 53 percent upfront on Feb. 3.  New York-based  Morgan Stanley (MS) , which bought credit swaps on
MBIA to offset potential losses if the insurer couldn’t make
good on its debt guarantees, reported $535 million in losses in
the last half of 2010 as the perceived risk of an MBIA default
declined and the value of the hedges plummeted.  Ruth Porat, Morgan Stanley’s CFO, said in an interview
today that the hedges are “not closed out” and that the bank
will “highlight” their performance in a conference call with
analysts later this morning.  To contact the reporter on this story:
