Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
largest private-equity firm, reported its best quarterly results
since going public four years ago as profit from its real estate
funds climbed fourfold.  First-quarter profit excluding some costs tied to the
firm’s initial public offering increased 58 percent to $568.1
million, or 51 cents a share, from $360.4 million, or 32 cents,
a year earlier, New York-based Blackstone said in a statement
today. The results beat the 41-cent average estimate of 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chairman  Stephen Schwarzman  has expanded non-buyout
businesses to add revenue and profit, and the value of the
firm’s investments in real estate and private equity is rising
amid a broader economic recovery.  “The macro picture is good for them,”  Roger Freeman , an
analyst with  Barclays Capital  in  New York , said in an interview
before the results were released. “They have a fairly broad
investment portfolio.”  The value of Blackstone’s real estate equity funds rose 8.7
percent in the first quarter, helping profit in the business
increase fourfold to $361 million from $89.3 million a year
earlier. The firm said it’s begun fundraising for its next
property fund.  First Net Income  In private equity, the value of assets increased 4.9
percent during the first quarter, as companies such as
BankUnited Inc. and Nielsen Holdings NV rose after going public.
Profit in private equity fell to $175.5 million from $193.2
million on higher operating expenses and lower investment
income, Blackstone said.  The company’s net income was $42.7 million, compared with a
loss a year earlier of $121.4 million. It was the first profit
under generally accepted accounting principles since the firm
went public in 2007. Blackstone said at the time of the offering
that costs tied to the IPO would cause net losses for several
years.  Fee-earnings assets rose 26 percent to $124 billion.
Private-equity assets increased 43 percent to $35.9 billion as
Blackstone began investing its sixth buyout fund. Real estate
assets gained 11 percent to $26.5 billion.  Blackstone rose 31 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $19.31 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company
is trading about 38 percent below its IPO price.  The firm agreed to pay $9.4 billion for the U.S. malls of
 Australia ’s  Centro Properties Group (CNP)  in the first quarter,
Blackstone’s biggest acquisition since 2007.  Blackstone also is expanding its credit activities. The
firm filed March 31 to open its third publicly traded fund for
its GSO Capital Partners business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
