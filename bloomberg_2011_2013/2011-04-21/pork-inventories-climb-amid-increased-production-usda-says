Pork stockpiles in the U.S.
rose 12 percent at the end of March from a year earlier,
the government said, amid increased production of the meat.  Warehouses held 577.2 million pounds of pork on March
31, up from  513.1 million  a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report.
Inventories rose 0.5 percent from the end of February. Pork
 output  totaled 2.05 billion pounds in March, up 0.7 percent
from a year earlier and 16 percent higher than February,
the USDA said earlier in a separate report.  “I suspect the increased output limited the need to
draw on frozen industry inventories,”  Dan Vaught , the
owner of Vaught Futures Insights, said in an e-mailed
report.  U.S. commercial red-meat  production  reached a record
4.35 billion pounds last month, up from 4.28 billion a year
earlier, the USDA said in the earlier report today. Red
meat includes beef, veal, pork, lamb and mutton.  “March is always a big month for production,”
because it often has more slaughter days than other months,
 Bob Brown , an independent market analyst in Edmond,
 Oklahoma , said before the report. “The times of high cold-
storage stocks are correlated with times of high
production.”  Hog weights have also been trending higher, meaning
more pork. In March, carcasses averaged 208.54 pounds (94.6
kilograms), about 3.5 pounds more than a year earlier,
government data show. Still, wholesale prices have risen 11
percent in the past year on increased demand, reaching
96.57 cents a pound on April 15, the highest in almost
eight months.  Late Easter  Ham inventories typically build up in the first two
months of the year in anticipation of demand for Easter,
when the meat is traditionally served at the holiday meal.
Easter is celebrated on April 24 this year.  “The late arrival of Easter this year probably caused
an increase in both ham and pork stocks,” Vaught said.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.125 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.00275 a pound at 12:51 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained
19 percent in the past year.  As of March 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, fell 11 percent to 52.5
million pounds from a year earlier, according to today’s
report. Warehouse supplies of ham rose 73 percent from a
year ago to 106.6 million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of March were 13
percent larger than a year earlier at 695.8 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 17 percent to 448.8
million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
