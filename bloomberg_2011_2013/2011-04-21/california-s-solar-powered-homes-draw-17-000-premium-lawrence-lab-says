In  California , installing solar
panels atop a home roof will increase its value by an average of
$17,000, according to a  study  by Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory.  The analysis of 72,000 home sales from 1999 to 2009 showed
that the almost 2,000 homes with roof-top solar systems
attracted higher bids from buyers who wanted to save money on
utility bills and reduce emissions of  greenhouse gases .  “The study shows that solar can be a solid investment for
homeowners and a revenue generator for homebuilders,” Tom
Kimbis, director of policy and research at the Washington-based
Solar Energy Industry Association, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
