Poland’s high inflation rate is a
“serious but temporary problem,” central bank Governor Marek
Belka was quoted as saying today on Polityka magazine’s website
Polityka.pl.  Local inflation has causes outside the domestic economy,
chiefly global increases in food and fuel prices, Belka told
reporters at Polityka’s editorial offices yesterday, according
to the website.   “The core inflation rate, excluding food and fuel prices,
is 2 percent, which is no drama,” Polityka.pl quoted Belka as
saying. “Of course I realize that consumers are feeling the
impact of rising fuel and food prices, which is something
monetary policy can’t ignore.”   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
