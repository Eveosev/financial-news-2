German tax revenue jumped in March,
the  Finance Ministry  said, citing “weak” tax receipts a year
earlier related to the economic crisis as the main reason for
the gain.  Tax revenue rose 16.5 percent from a year earlier to 45.6
billion euros ($66.5 billion), the ministry said today in its
monthly report, adding that annual increases will shrink through
the year. The ministry said it expects to collect 1 percent more
tax in the year as a whole compared with 2010.  “The economic upswing in  Germany  has shown increasing
dynamism again recently,” the Berlin-based ministry said. That
“will continue, though the increase in aggregate output won’t
be quite as strong” as last year.  German business confidence fell for a second month in April
after  oil prices  rose to the highest in 2 1/2 years, the Munich-
based Ifo institute said today. Still, economic growth
accelerated in the first quarter as companies increased spending
and stepped up hiring, according to Bundesbank estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
