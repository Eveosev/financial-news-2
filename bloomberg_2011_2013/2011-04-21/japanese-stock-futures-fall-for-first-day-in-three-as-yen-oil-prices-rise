Japanese stock futures dropped for
the first time in three days as the yen strengthened to a three-
week high against the dollar and oil prices rose.  American depositary receipts of Honda Motor Co., a carmaker
that gets about 80 percent of sales abroad, dropped 0.6 percent
from the closing share price yesterday in  Tokyo . Canon Inc. fell
0.6 percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported the camera
maker’s profit declined. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.
dropped 1.1 percent after an agreement was reached to convert
its preferred shares in  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to common stock.  “The dollar weakened on speculation the U.S. will maintain
its easy monetary policy,” said Juichi Wako, a senior
strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Tokyo. “That’s a negative
factor for Japanese stocks, especially exporters.”  Futures on  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,650 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,680
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,660 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Stock markets in Australia,  New
Zealand  and Singapore are closed today for a holiday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.5 percent
yesterday after Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest
brokerage, said trading revenue more than doubled from the
fourth quarter. Morgan Stanley also reached a deal to convert
most of Mitsubishi UFJ’s preferred stock in the company, paying
a premium of about $2 billion to eliminate annual dividend
payments of $784 million.  Yen Gains  The yen appreciated to 81.62 last night, the highest level
since March 29, from 81.98 at the close of trading in Tokyo
yesterday. Against the euro, the currency rose as high as
118.64, compared with 119.79.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 84 cents to $112.29 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, advancing for a third day. The
London Metal Exchange Index of six metals gained 1 percent.  Aluminum Corp. of  China  Ltd., China’s largest producer of
the metal, may be active today after the company posted a 47
percent drop in first-quarter profit on higher raw-material and
fuel costs.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the  S&P
500  and of 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated earnings
on average as of the last close, compared with 13.7 times for
the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
