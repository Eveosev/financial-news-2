OCI Co.,  South Korea ’s biggest
polysilicon maker, advanced to a record in Seoul trading after
quarterly profit more than doubled, prompting brokerages to
raise their share-price estimates.  The stock gained 12 percent to 613,000 won at the 3 p.m.
close on the Korea Exchange, the best performer on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. The benchmark  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 1.3 percent.  Global demand for solar power may almost double by 2015,
OCI said yesterday. The Seoul-based company plans to spend 1.8
trillion won ($1.7 billion) by the end of 2013 on a new plant to
make polysilicon, used in solar cells.  “Investors are betting that the company will continue to
deliver strong earnings in coming quarters,” said Im Jeong Jae,
a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees $30 billion. “OCI is among the
top-tier companies in terms of product quality and capacity.”  Net income rose to 327.5 billion won in the first quarter
from 118.5 billion won a year earlier. Woori Investment &
Securities Co., LIG Investment & Securities Co. and NH
Investment & Securities Co. raised their share-price estimates,
citing the first-quarter results and a stronger earnings outlook.  The polysilicon maker won a $361 million order from AU
Optronics Corp. of  Taiwan , according to a regulatory filing on
April 18. That followed a $904 million order from  China 
announced last month.  OCI, whose shares have tripled in the past year, isn’t
alone in betting polysilicon demand will rise.  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) ,
South Korea’s biggest chemicals maker, is preparing to move into
the polysilicon business, Chief Executive Officer Kim Bahn Suk
said on April 19. Hanwha Chemical Corp. plans to spend 1.04
trillion won on a polysilicon plant to help more than double
sales within five years, the company said on April 11.  To contact the reporters on this story:
