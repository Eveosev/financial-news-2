Asian stocks fell, dragging a
benchmark index down the most in a week, after  Acer Inc. (2353)  and
Reliance Industries Ltd.’s earnings missed analysts’ estimates.  Acer, the world’s second-largest supplier of  notebook
computers , lost 3.1 percent in Taipei. Reliance Industries,
 India ’s biggest company by market value, dropped 3 percent in
Mumbai. Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. led Chinese steelmakers lower
on speculation accelerating inflation will hurt economic growth.
Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s second-biggest carmaker, sank 1.3
percent after domestic output slumped last month.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.2 percent to 138.57 at
7:52 p.m. in Tokyo, with about four shares falling for every
three that rose. The gauge earlier gained 0.1 percent. Stock
markets in  Australia ,  New Zealand  and  Hong Kong  are closed for a
holiday. After the close in Tokyo today, Nintendo Co. forecast
profit that missed estimates and KDDI Corp. said annual profit
will fall 2 percent this fiscal year.  “People are awaiting earnings announcements this week
before investing,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , who helps oversee $6
billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co. “With Japan
about to head towards its Golden Week holiday, and with a lot of
other markets closed, we probably won’t see exciting
developments in the market.”  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index sank 1.5 percent, while
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average lost 0.1 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi index rose 0.8 percent.  Vietnam ’s VN Index advanced 2
percent, the most among Asia Pacific benchmark indexes, as the
country’s currency climbed the most since 2008.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent
following a holiday on April 22. A government report today may
show the country’s new home sales rose 12 percent in March,
according to a survey of economists compiled by Bloomberg.
Reports on Japanese retail trade, U.S. durable goods orders and
gross domestic product are also due this week.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.8 percent this year
through April 21, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the  S&P
500  and 1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian gauge were valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average as of the last close, compared with 13.7 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  Technology shares were the biggest drags on the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index. Acer lost 3.1 percent to NT$49.5 after first-
quarter net income tumbled 64 percent to NT$1.2 billion ($42
million). The average analyst estimate was for profit of NT$1.74
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reliance,  Posco (005490)   Reliance Industries dropped 3 percent to 1,009.35 rupees in
Mumbai after reporting a 14 percent increase in net income to
53.8 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) in the three months to March
31. Profit missed the average 54.3 billion-rupee estimate of 18
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Posco, the world’s third-biggest steelmaker by output, fell
1.9 percent to 472,000 won in  Seoul  after first-quarter profit
slumped 33 percent as raw-material costs increased.  In China, shares declined as rising oil prices stoked
concern inflation will accelerate and monetary tightening
measures will increase. Crude rose as high as $113.07 a barrel
in  New York , the highest intraday price since April 11.  Baoshan Steel lost 2.7 percent to 7.12 yuan. Anhui Conch
Cement Co., the biggest cement maker, fell 2.8 percent to 38.88
yuan in  Shanghai , while Sany Heavy Industry Co., the largest
maker of machinery for handling concrete, retreated 4.1 percent
to 18.52 yuan.  “Inflation is still the major concern and there’s no sign
that the government will relax its tightening,” said Wu Kan, a
 fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285
million. “The tightening will hold back stocks’ valuations.”  Central Bank Policies  The Shanghai Composite has risen 5.6 percent this year on
speculation the government will cool inflation without
triggering a slump in economic growth. The central bank has
raised the reserve-requirement ratio 10 times since the start of
2010 and boosted  interest rates  four times to cool inflation as
consumer prices rose at the fastest pace since 2008 in March.  Japanese carmakers fell today after reporting domestic
output for March, the month a record 9-magnitude earthquake and
tsunami disrupted supply chains for the nation’s manufacturers.  Honda, which reported a 63 percent slump in production last
month, dropped 1.3 percent to 3,105 yen, the third-biggest drag
on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s
biggest carmaker, dropped 0.6 percent to 3,275 yen after it said
global output fell 30 percent.  Record Sales  “Supply chains have been torn up from their roots,” said
Yoshifumi Kikuchi, head of dealing at Nissan Century Securities
Co. in Tokyo. “It’s still unclear whether carmakers can get the
parts they need.”  In South Korea,  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , the nation’s No. 2
automaker, advanced 3.2 percent to 80,500 won after Yonhap News
reported the company had sold a record number of vehicles in the
first quarter. Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea’s largest carmaker,
advanced 5.6 percent to 246,000 won.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the operator of a nuclear power
plant crippled by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan last month,
jumped 8.4 percent to 438 yen. The stock’s first advance in
eight days was also the biggest in the Nikkei 225.  A government plan to compensate victims of the Fukushima
nuclear accident does not involve de-listing the utility, the
Nikkei newspaper reported on April 23.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., which owns 13.2
million  Tokyo  Electric shares, gained 1.1 percent to 379 yen.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rose 0.8 percent to 2,455
yen. The company owns 35.9 million Tepco shares, or 2.2 percent
of the utility.  To contact the reporters on this story:
