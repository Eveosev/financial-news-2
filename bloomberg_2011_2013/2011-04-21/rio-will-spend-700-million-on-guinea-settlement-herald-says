Rio Tinto Group will pay as much as
$700 million to the government of  Guinea  to secure development
rights to its Simandou iron ore project in the country, the
Sydney Morning Herald reported.  A deal was struck after  George Soros  agreed this year to
act as an adviser on a new mining code for the West African
nation, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information. The payment is yet to be announced, it said.  Rio is expected to define the deal as a settlement payment,
a move that may attract criticism as being against transparency
best practice for mining companies in developing nations, the
newspaper said. Illtud Harri, a London-based spokesman for Rio,
declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
