Royal Emirates Group bought Spanish
soccer team Getafe for between 70 million and 90 million euros
($131 million), a partner at the group said in Dubai today.  Kaiser Rafiq said the club is debt-free, and the deal is
for 100 percent of Getafe, which is 14th of 20 clubs in the top
division of Spanish soccer.  “Team Dubai” will form part of Getafe’s logo, although
the club will not be renamed, Rafiq said. The Dubai group is a
holding company chaired by Sheikh Butti Bin Suhail Al Maktoum.  Getafe, based in the outskirts of  Madrid , was promoted to
the top division of Spanish soccer for the first time in 2004.
It finished sixth in the standings last season to earn a place
in the Europa League, but hasn’t matched that performance this
campaign, winning 10 of 32 league games so far.  A call to Getafe seeking confirmation of the transaction
wasn’t answered outside of business hours.  Two other Spanish clubs have been taken over by Gulf
investors in the past year. Dubai-based Indian Ahsan Ali Syed
bought  Racing Santander  in January, and Sheikh Abdullah Bin
Nasser Al Thani of Qatar bought Malaga last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
