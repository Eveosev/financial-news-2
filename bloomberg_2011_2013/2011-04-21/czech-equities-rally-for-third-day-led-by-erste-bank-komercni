The Czech Republic’s main equity
index jumped the most in almost a month as  CEZ AS (CEZ)  stepped up
presales of electricity and higher-than-expected company
earnings boosted investor demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The PX gauge of 15 stocks advanced 1 percent to 1,254.8 at
the 4:28 p.m. close in  Prague . The index is up 1.2 percent this
week.  CEZ, the country’s biggest power utility, jumped to a 10-
month high after saying it has accelerated the presale of its
output for 2012 and 2013 to take advantage of higher electricity
prices in  Germany . The stock, which has a 22 percent weighting
in the PX, rallied 2.5 percent to 911.8 koruna.  Stocks and commodities rallied globally as companies from
Apple Inc. to Morgan Stanley posted earnings that beat analyst
projections, fueling confidence in the global economy.  In Prague, Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  rose 1.4 percent,
the most since March 24, to 858.8 koruna.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the
Czech unit of Societe Generale SA, advanced 1.3 percent to 4,250
koruna, its third day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
