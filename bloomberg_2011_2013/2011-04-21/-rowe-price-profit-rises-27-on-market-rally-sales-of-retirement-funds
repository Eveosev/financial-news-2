T. Rowe Price Group Inc.’s first-
quarter earnings missed analysts’ estimates by the widest margin
in two years on lower-than-expected fund deposits from
institutional investors.  Net income increased 27 percent to $194.6 million, or 72
cents a share, from $153 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier,
the Baltimore-based company said today in a statement. The
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
earnings of 75 cents a share, excluding certain items.  “Institutional is where the primary miss was,” Daniel Fannon, a San Francisco-based analyst at Jefferies & Co., wrote
in a research note today. Fannon, who expected T. Rowe to earn
77 cents a share, said higher-than-expected expenses also
lowered profit.  T. Rowe, led by Chief Executive Officer James Kennedy, 57,
increased spending as it hired additional employees and
increased advertising spending. Expenses rose 17 percent to
$370.9 million.  T. Rowe fell $2.29, or 3.5 percent, to $64.08 at 4:00 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The company has
declined 0.7 percent this year, compared with a 1 percent gain
by the S&P index of asset managers and custody banks.  ‘Optimistic for Future’  The company hired new staff in  investment management ,
technology and operations positions, Kennedy said in a telephone
interview.  “We’re not hiring for the next quarter,” Kennedy said.
“The basic fundamentals are in reasonable shape for companies
and valuations are also reasonable. We’re optimistic about the
future.”  T. Rowe also continued to increase advertising spending,
helping to boost expenses by 17 percent to $371 million. The
company said it expects advertising expenditures in 2011 will be
15 percent higher than last year.  T. Rowe benefited as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained
19 percent through yesterday since the end of 2009.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the New York-based money manager, said
today that first-quarter net income rose 34 percent to $568
million, or $2.89 a share. Denver’s  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) 
said its first-quarter net income increased 21 percent to $37.9
million, or 21 cents a share.  ‘Lumpy’ Investments  T. Rowe’s assets under management climbed 5.8 percent in
the three months ended March 31 to a record $510 billion,
helping boost revenue 23 percent to $682 million.  Investors poured $5.8 billion into T. Rowe products during
the quarter, including $4.4 billion to mutual funds.
Institutional accounts gathered $1.4 billion, compared with the
$3.5 billion expected by Fannon. Market appreciation and income
added $22.1 billion to assets.  Kennedy said institutional investments tend to be
“lumpy.” He said individual investors were showing a greater
appetite for risk by moving more money into stock funds, which
are typically more profitable for money managers than bond
funds.  “On the retail front investors are continuing to tip-toe
into equities,” he said.  The company said cash and its own investments rose 20
percent to $1.8 billion.  “That money is not burning a hole in our pocket,” Kennedy
said. “We’re happy to have a strong balance sheet, and we’re
happy to keep it that way.”  Vanguard Group Inc. of  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania, and
Boston’s Fidelity Investments are the largest providers of
target-date retirement funds in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
