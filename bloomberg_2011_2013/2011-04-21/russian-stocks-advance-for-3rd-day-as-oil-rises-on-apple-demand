Russian stocks dropped as retreats
by companies including OAO Polymetal and OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel
offset a rise in  oil prices  spurred by Apple Inc.’ s better-
than-expected profit.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  of 30 stocks lost 0.5 percent to 1,774.12.
at 4:37 p.m. in Moscow. OAO Novolipetsk Steel climbed after
announcing it bought out Duferco Group from a joint venture. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index rallied 0.8 percent to 2,048.13.  “The market is still pretty cautious on Russia in the
light of the U.S. outlook downgrade on Monday,” Tom Mundy,
chief strategist at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone from
Moscow. “The market has been very overweight Russia.”  The Micex dropped 3.7 percent, the most in nine months,
April 18 after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded its credit-rating
outlook for the U.S. to “negative” from “stable.”  Oil for June delivery gained as much as $1.03 per barrel in
 New York  today after Apple earnings indicated consumer demand
may help boost the global economy and after the U.S. energy
department reported an unexpected drop in crude supplies.  Novolipetsk rose 1.6 percent to 113.99 rubles. The company
said it agreed to pay Duferco Group $600 million for its half of
their Steel Invest and Finance venture.  Norilsk Nickel  OAO Polymetal slid 4.1 percent to 531.2 rubles even as gold
climbed to a record in  London  and New York for a fifth day. The
Russian gold and silver producer cut its 2011 output forecast
for the precious metals yesterday due to “schedule setbacks”
at its Amursk and Omolon projects.  “The market is trading the company, not the underlying
commodity,” Mundy said. “You can see that quite well with
Polyus, which is holding up much better” than Polymetal.  OAO Polyus Gold shares gained 3.6 percent to 1,781.9
rubles, the highest intraday price since Feb. 1. Gold advanced
to a record high.  Norilsk Nickel dropped for the first day in three, losing
0.7 percent to 7,639 rubles. United Co. Rusal, a shareholder in
 Russia ’s largest mining company, said yesterday the company’s
deal to sell 8 percent of its shares to Trafigura Beheer BV
lacked transparency.  OAO Aeroflot lost 1.2 percent to 70.33 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
