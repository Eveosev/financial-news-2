Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  will allocate space
on two pipelines for May because demand for crude shipments
exceeds capacity, the company said.  Line 5, which runs from Superior,  Wisconsin , to Sarnia,
Ontario, and has a capacity of 490,000 barrels a day, will be
able to meet 93 percent of next month’s requests to move oil,
Jennifer Varey, a Calgary-based spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.
The line was able to take 92 percent of orders in April.  Line 6B, which has a capacity of 290,000 barrels a day and
runs between Griffith, Indiana, and Sarnia, can meet 90 percent
of shipper requests for May. The line was able to accommodate 83
percent of orders in April.  The apportionment is the result of “temporary capacity
restrictions that Enbridge has instituted in connection with the
focused pipeline integrity inspection program” and a large
number of shipper requests, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
