SVG Capital Plc (SVI) , the biggest backer
of private equity firm Permira Advisers LLP, said the value of
its assets climbed 11 percent in the first quarter as rising
stock markets buoyed the value of its holdings.  Net asset value rose to 350.6 pence a share at the end of
March, including the firm’s own valuation of its funds
management and funds-of-funds units, London-based SVG said in a
statement today. The company marked up the value of its stake in
 Hugo Boss  by 41.8 million pounds ($68.8 million) and casino
operator Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. by 28.5 million pounds.  The valuation of SVG’s stake in Hugo Boss reflected an
“increase in expected earnings as the company continues to
benefit from a recovery in the markets in which it operates,”
while Galaxy was written up because of the 29 percent increase
in its share price over the quarter, SVG said.  The firm marked down the value of its holding in British
fashion retailer New Look by 13.5 million pounds to zero, citing
“issues” with its fashion ranges and “a challenging external
environment.” SVG said it has already reaped twice its original
investment in the company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
