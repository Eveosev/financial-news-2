Pioneer Food Group Ltd. climbed the
most in a month after saying it expected earnings per share for
the six months to March 31 to rise following anti-trust
provisions.  The stock jumped 1.96 rand, or 3.5 percent, to 58.19 rand
as at 5 p.m. in Johannesburg, when the market closes.  Earnings per share are expected to increase by between 160
percent and 180 percent, according to a regulatory statement
today. Pioneer has set aside 350 million rand ($51.9 million)
for an anti-trust fine following its conviction last year for
fixing the price of bread.  To contact the reporter on this story:
