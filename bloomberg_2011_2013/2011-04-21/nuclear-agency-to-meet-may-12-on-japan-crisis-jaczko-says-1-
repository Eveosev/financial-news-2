The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
will meet May 12 to discuss its safety review of U.S. plants
following Japan’s reactor crisis, said  Gregory Jaczko , the
agency’s chairman.  NRC staff will brief the five commissioners at the public
meeting on the progress of a 90-day review, Jaczko said today in
an interview in Baltimore. Commissioners will determine if
officials are “approaching things the right way and heading in
the right direction,” he said.  The NRC is reviewing U.S. reactors after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused a partial meltdown at
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. The
plant’s cooling systems were knocked out, allowing its fuel rods
to overheat and causing explosions, fires and radiation leaks.  Japanese officials assigned the crisis a rating of 7, the
highest level on an international scale and equal to the 1986
Chernobyl disaster. The utility said April 17 that it may take
three to six months to put the reactors into a cold shutdown,
where core reactor temperatures fall below 100 degrees Celsius
(212 degrees Fahrenheit).  Jaczko told lawmakers at an April 12 hearing that the
situation at Fukushima was “static” and not yet “stable.”
Jaczko said the NRC, which has a team of officials in  Japan ,
hasn’t altered its assessment in the past week.  “It hasn’t changed too much,” he said after a speech at
 Johns Hopkins University ’s Carey Business School.  To contact the reporter on this story:
