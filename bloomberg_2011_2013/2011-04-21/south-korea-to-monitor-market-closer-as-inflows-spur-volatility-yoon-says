The South Korean government will
step up its monitoring of financial markets as global capital
flows into  South Korea  may see more volatility with U.S.
quantitative easing nearing an end, said the nation’s finance
minister, Yoon Jeung Hyun.  Yoon said in a speech prepared for a local forum in Seoul
today that the volatility of global fund flows may increase over
time as it will be hard for countries to reach an agreement on
how to reform the international monetary system.  The global economy may slip into an extended period of slow
growth, damped by lingering debt that triggered the global
financial crisis and moved from the private sector to the
government.  Japan ’s earthquake and power shortage may disrupt the
global supply chain, Yoon said. He reiterated his commitment to
take actions to ensure price stability in the first half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
