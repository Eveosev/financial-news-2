The European Union won’t
“necessarily” link implementation of the Basel III capital
rules to simultaneous compliance by the U.S., Handelsblatt
reported, citing unidentified people at the European Commission.  The EU will rely on the U.S. promise to the Group of 20
countries to implement Basel III and won’t formally include that
condition in draft rules to be presented by beginning of July,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
