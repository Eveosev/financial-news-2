Czech President Vaclav Klaus named
two new ministers today, ending a rift within the three-party
coalition that threatened to bring down the government and
hamper planned deficit cuts.  Jan Kubice was appointed Interior Minister and Radek Smerda
as Transportation Minister by Klaus at a ceremony at Prague
Castle. Kubice replaces Radek John, who will become deputy
premier for fighting corruption. Smerda will take over for Vit
Barta, who resigned on April 8 after allegations of improper
financial dealings. He has denied any wrongdoing.  “This hopefully ends the crisis within the coalition
government,” Klaus said.  The three coalition parties clashed after Prime Minister
Petr Necas said on April 11 that he wanted to fire John and
Education Minister Josef Dobes, both from the Public Affairs
party, over their ties to a private detective agency. The row
threatened Necas’s pledge to overhaul the money-losing pension
system and trim the fiscal gap below the European Union’s limit
of 3 percent of economic output by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
