A smaller South African fiscal
deficit or a surplus will make it easier to respond to economic
crises, Business Day reported, citing Lungisa Fuzile, the next
director-general of the National Treasury.  A strong fiscal position allowed the country to avoid a
large cut in spending during the global financial crisis in
2009, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Fuzile as saying.  Fuzile was yesterday named to replace Lesetja Kganyago as
Treasury director-general from May 16. Kganyago will become
deputy governor at the central bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
