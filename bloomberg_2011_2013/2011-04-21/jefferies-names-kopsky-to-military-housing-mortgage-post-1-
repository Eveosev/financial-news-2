Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the
investment bank that’s been expanding since the financial
crisis, named Paul Kopsky a managing director for the firm’s
military-housing mortgage business.  Kopsky, 46, was executive vice president and chief
financial officer of  American Stock Transfer & Trust Co. , New
York-based Jefferies said today in a statement. He will be
responsible for sourcing and originating military housing bond-
issue transactions, according to the statement.  Jefferies paid $9 million in 2009 to buy servicing rights
on an $8 billion military-housing portfolio held by Capmark
Financial Group Inc., which had collapsed into bankruptcy.
Jefferies earned $3.5 million in fees related to the servicing
rights in the 11 months through Nov. 31 last year, according to
a filing with securities regulators.  Kopsky was an executive vice president, principal
accounting officer and controller for Capmark before joining
American Stock Transfer & Trust, according to the statement.  Congress established the  Military Housing Privatization
Initiative  in 1996 under which the government selects private
financers, developers and managers for family housing units on
military bases. In the three months through Feb. 28, Jefferies
earned $900,000 in fees from servicing loans that finance those
projects, according to a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
