The shekel gained for a third day,
to the highest in more than two years, against the dollar as
optimism about global growth dampened demand for the relative
safety of the greenback. Ten-year  government bonds  fell.  U.K. retail sales unexpectedly rose in March as the biggest
jump in spending on food in 10 months outweighed a decline at
other shops. Sales of U.S. previously owned homes rose to a 5.1
million annual rate in March, exceeding the 5 million median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The index of
U.S. leading economic indicators probably increased for a ninth
month in March, economists said before a report today.  “There’s thinking that the world’s recovering and things
are getting better so there’s less demand for the safety of the
dollar,” Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading at Bank Leumi Le-
Israel Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by telephone. Concern that the
U.S. may lose its AAA rating from  Standard & Poor’s  is also
still weighing on the dollar, he added.  Standard & Poor’s put the U.S. on notice April 18 that it
risks losing its AAA credit rating unless policy makers agree on
a plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the national debt.  The shekel strengthened 0.5 percent to 3.4011 per dollar at
12:07 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the highest level since September 2008.
The Israeli currency fell 0.4 percent against the euro to
4.9761. The dollar weakened against all 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 fell,
pushing the yield on the 5 percent note up 3 basis points to
5.28 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
