Parex Banka AS’s banking license
means it cannot use its obligatory reserves to repay a
syndicated loan, the Latvian central bank said.  “Parex Banka is a credit institution that has a bank
license that is still in force,” the central bank said today in
a  statement  on its website. “In accordance with the law, all
credit institutions have to ensure implementation of the
obligatory reserves.”  Riga-based Parex, which no longer gives loans and holds
non-performing assets, yesterday asked the central bank and the
bank regulator for permission to use 26 million lati ($53.6
million) in obligatory reserves to make a final 164 million-lati
payment of a syndicated loan due May 5.  Latvia turned to a group led by the European Commission and
the  International Monetary Fund  for a 7.5 billion-euro ($11
billion) bailout after Parex collapsed in 2008. The government
split Parex into an  asset management company  and created a new
retail bank called Citadele Banka AS in preparation for the sale
of both.  “Our mandatory reserves are calculated and accumulated
largely on the basis of the bank’s liabilities toward the
investments made by the Ministry of Finance and repayment of the
syndicated loan,” Chairman Christopher Gwilliam said yesterday
in a statement to the Riga Stock Exchange. “Therefore, the use
of these funds for repaying the loan is a logical step.”  The repayment of the syndicated loan is the final tranche
due after the payment of 775 million euros in credit was
rescheduled when the state acquired Parex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
