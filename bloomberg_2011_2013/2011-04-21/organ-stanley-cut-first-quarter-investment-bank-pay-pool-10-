Morgan Stanley (MS) , this year’s top
merger adviser, set aside $1.95 billion to pay investment bank
employee salaries, bonuses and benefits in the first quarter,
down 10 percent from a year earlier.  Pay at the institutional-securities unit, which employs
traders and bankers, was 54 percent of revenue, compared with 41
percent in the first quarter of 2010, according to the New York-
based company’s  website . The unit’s revenue fell 33 percent to
$3.59 billion. For the company as a whole, compensation and
benefits totaled $4.33 billion, down 2 percent.  James Gorman , who became Morgan Stanley’s chief executive
officer last year, promised to reduce the portion of overall
revenue awarded in compensation after it surged to 62 percent in
2009. The companywide compensation ratio for the quarter was 57
percent.  Morgan Stanley didn’t take into account a $655 million
pretax loss from a Japanese joint venture when determining the
amount to accrue for compensation, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today in an interview. Excluding the loss and a
charge tied to a narrowing of the firm’s own credit spreads, the
investment bank’s compensation ratio was 44 percent and the
firm-wide ratio was 51 percent, Porat said.  Employee Pay  Companywide compensation, the firm’s largest expense, was
enough to pay each of its 62,494 employees $69,335 for the three
months, down from $71,998 for each of the 61,335 employees at
the end of the first quarter of 2010, according to the figures
released today. The New York-based bank doesn’t report
headcounts for its three divisions.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  set aside $5.23 billion for
compensation and benefits expense, enough to pay each employee
$147,825 for the quarter, down 11 percent from $165,952 a year
earlier, the New York-based firm said earlier this week.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, set aside $3.29 billion in the quarter to compensate
employees at its investment bank, or an average $124,300 per
person, according to the New York-based bank’s earnings report
last week.  Wall Street firms typically reserve a portion of revenue
throughout the year for employees, awarding most of the money as
year-end bonuses. Average pay per worker doesn’t reflect the
amount of money employees actually receive. Top executives and
revenue producers sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards,
while clerical workers get smaller salaries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
