The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
rose 9.29, or less than 0.1 percent, to 32,668.15 at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified miner which
makes up 11 percent of the index, fell for the first day in
four, declining 6.50 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 346 rand. Copper,
nickel, aluminum, tin and platinum fell on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  may end its bond-buying program and as  China  was
said to be tightening its credit policy.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s biggest mining
company, slid 2.68 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 281.35 rand.  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)   gained 60 cents, or 2.5 percent, to
24.60 rand. The media company is worth more than the 26 rand-a-
share ($3.88) being offered by Capitau Holdings Ltd. and RMB
Ventures, said  South Africa ’s Public Investment Corp. The PIC,
which owns 9.3 percent of Avusa, said “29 rand or better”
would be fairer.  Blue Financial Services Ltd. (BFS)   gained the most in
more than a month, adding 2 cents, or 7.4 percent, to 29 cents.
The financial services firm said its fiscal full-year per-share
loss will drop by as much as 95 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
