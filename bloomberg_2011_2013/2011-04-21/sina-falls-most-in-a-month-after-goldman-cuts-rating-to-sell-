Sina Corp., which owns the Twitter-
like Weibo service in  China , fell the most in a month after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the company’s shares to
“sell.”  The shares slid 4.9 percent to $135.86 at 11:45 a.m. in New
York trading, after losing as much as 8.6 percent earlier, the
biggest intraday decline since March 15. Goldman analysts led by
Catherine Leung cut the company’s rating from “neutral” in a
research note today, saying the share price fully reflects the
company’s value.  Sina, also the owner of China’s third-most visited website,
had more than doubled this year through yesterday on
“expectations that Weibo will evolve from a social media into a
fully fledged social network,” the Goldman report said.  The shares “have already more than fairly reflected the
potential” for Sina to evolve, the report said. “With tougher
competition for Weibo, we see Sina’s current risk-reward as
uncompelling, and expect a correction as investors more deeply
consider Sina’s ability to monetize Weibo.”  Four analysts rate the company sell, 15 rate it buy and
seven give it a hold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Baidu Inc., which owns the most popular online search
engine in China, advanced 0.7 percent to $150.42, headed toward
a record closing price. Sohu.com, which owns China’s fourth-most
visited website, rose 1.8 percent to $96.59.  To contact the reporter on this story:
