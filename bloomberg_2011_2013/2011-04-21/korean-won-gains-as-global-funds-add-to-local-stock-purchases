South Korea ’s won advanced to the
strongest level in 31 months as overseas funds added to holdings
of the nation’s assets on optimism the global economic recovery
is intact. Bonds dropped.  The currency gained for a second day after the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1.4 percent as earnings per share
exceeded predictions for 78 percent of the companies in the
index that have posted results since April 11. The Kospi stock
index closed at a record high as global investors bought more
local stocks than they sold for a second day.  “The won is being supported by various factors, including
the rise in the local and overseas stock markets, which may
prompt more dollar inflows,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency
analyst at Samsung Futures Inc. in  Seoul .  The won climbed 0.2 percent to 1,080.13 as of the 3 p.m.
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency reached 1,078.30, the strongest level since September
2008.  South Korea’s financial regulator and the central bank will
jointly examine banks’ foreign-currency forward contracts with
the focus on non-deliverable forward transactions, the  finance
ministry  said today. The inspections, from April 26 to May 6,
will assess whether banks abided by regulations limiting the
amount of foreign-exchange derivatives trade.  “The announcement is limiting further gains in the won,”
Jeon said.  The yield on South Korea’s 3 percent bond due December 2013
increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.78
percent, according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
