Gasoline rose to a 33-month high as
U.S. and European inventories declined and as equities climbed
on stronger corporate earnings, higher  consumer confidence  and a
gain in leading indicators.  Futures advanced 1 percent as U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell
to a five-month low and European supplies also shrank on
stronger demand for exports. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
advanced 0.5 percent as higher-than-estimated earnings at
companies from Apple Inc. to Morgan Stanley bolstered optimism
that the economy is recovering.  “People are encouraged by better corporate earnings and
the potential that will translate into more jobs and higher
demand for petroleum products, and they don’t want to be short
going into the long weekend,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 3.13 cents to settle at
$3.3086 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 0.6 percent this week. That’s the highest settlement since
July 15, 2008.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.58 million barrels to 208.1
million in the week ended April 15, the Energy Department
reported yesterday. Supplies have declined 33 million barrels,
or 14 percent, since Feb. 11, when they reached the highest
level in almost 21 years.  European Supplies  Inventories of the fuel in independent storage in  Europe ’s
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub fell to the lowest
level in more than three months, according to PJK International
BV. Supplies plunged 21 percent to 644,000 metric tons in the
week to today, according to PJK, a researcher based in
Oosterhout in the Netherlands.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months increased 0.4 percent in March, the ninth
consecutive monthly gain. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index
climbed to minus 42.6 in the period to April 17, the best
reading since the end of February.  Regular retail gasoline rose 0.3 cent to $3.84 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest price
since Sept. 16, 2008.  Heating oil sank after a report that manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region slowed in April as measures of orders and
sales declined, indicating shipments by rail and truck may slip
and reduce diesel fuel demand. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index dropped to 18.5, the
lowest level since November, from 43.4 the prior month.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the index would fall
to 36.9.  Heating oil for May delivery slipped 2.22 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $3.1992 a gallon on the exchange. Prices
fell 0.8 percent this week.  Distillate Supplies  Prices rose 2 percent yesterday as the Energy Department
reported that stockpiles of distillates, including heating oil
and diesel, dropped 2.5 million barrels to 148.3 million in the
week ended April 15. Consumption of the fuels increased 8.2
percent.  “Heating oil went up too much and now it’s giving back a
little,” said Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc.
in  New York .  Trading on both the Nymex and the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London  will be closed tomorrow for Good Friday, the
start of the Easter holiday.  Volume for gasoline futures was 113,940 contracts in
electronic trading as of 4:07 p.m., 0.9 percent below the
average over the past three months. Heating oil volume was
88,921 lots, 29 percent below the average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
