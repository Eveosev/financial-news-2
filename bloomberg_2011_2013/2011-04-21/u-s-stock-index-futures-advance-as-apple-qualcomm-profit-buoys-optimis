U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index near its bull-market high, as
stronger-than-estimated earnings at companies from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to
Morgan Stanley bolstered optimism about the economy.  Technology companies rallied as Apple and  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) 
advanced at least 2.4 percent after reporting profit and sales

The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 52.45 points, or 0.4
percent, to 12,505.99, its highest close since June 2008.  “There’s no doubt this rally’s earnings-driven,” said Tom Wirth, senior investment officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co.,
which manages $1.6 billion in Elmira,  New York . “The Dow is at
a three-year high because earnings are also at a three-year
high. We expect this quarter to be a record quarter. We’re
seeing the top line pick up. This is a multinational large-
company story. It’s company after company.”  Earnings Season  S&P 500 companies have topped analyst estimates for eight
straight quarters, the longest streak since at least 2006,
helping propel the gauge up 97 percent from the market bottom on

the group and exceeded estimates at 72 percent.  David Kostin , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief U.S. equity

carry on that momentum throughout 2011. Kostin forecasts the S&P
500 will rise to 1,500 by the end of 2011, the second-highest
estimate out of 13 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “We are seeing excellent results thus far,” said New
York-based Kostin, in an interview on Bloomberg Television.
