Texas firefighters are still
battling 17 wildfires covering about 868,000 acres, while eight
other fires were contained as of yesterday, said Holly Huffman,
a spokeswoman at the Texas Forest Service in  College Station .  “Weather-wise, we’re getting a brief reprieve over the
next couple of days,” Huffman today said in an e-mail.
“Hopefully, that will allow our folks to really take an
aggressive stance on the current wildfires. We’ve got critical
fire weather expected again” on April 25 and April 26, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
