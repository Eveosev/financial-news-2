Most U.K. stocks rose and the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  posted a weekly gain as mining
companies climbed with metal prices, helping to offset a decline
in  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)   Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  and African Barrick Gold Plc increased more
than 1 percent in London as gold jumped to a record and silver
advanced to a 31-year high.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  led banks higher after
Nomura Holdings Inc. said the lender’s shares are “oversold.”
Vodafone sank 4.3 percent as Royal KPN NV, the biggest Dutch
phone company, cut its 2011 earnings forecast.  The benchmark FTSE 100 slid 3.96, or 0.1 percent, to
6,018.3 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London as more than three
companies rose for every two that fell. The gauge, which surged
2.1 percent yesterday, advanced 0.4 percent this week. The  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  was unchanged, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
climbed 0.7 percent as  CRH Plc (CRH)  and  Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  surged.  “Banks have fared well and soaring commodity prices have
given miners a boost,” said Ben Critchley, a London-based sales
trader at IG Index. “Bottom of the pile was Vodafone after a
profits warning from KPN.”  The FTSE 100 has recouped all of its losses from April 18’s
selloff after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook for the long-
term sovereign credit rating of the U.S. to negative. Since
hitting its 2011 low on March 16, the U.K. gauge has rebounded
7.5 percent.  Fresnillo, African Barrick  Fresnillo, the world’s largest primary silver producer,

pence and  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , which posted a 15 percent increase
in first-quarter output, gained 1.1 percent to 910 pence.  Gold traded at more than $1,500 an ounce after investors
sought to protect their wealth from further currency debasement
and accelerating inflation. Silver, palladium and platinum also
advanced in  New York .  Barclays led banks higher, rallying 1.5 percent to 298.9
pence, as Nomura said the lender’s valuation “offers support”
in a weak environment for revenue. Analysts reiterated their
“neutral” rating and 340 pence price estimate, 14 percent
above today’s closing price. Barclays reports its earnings next
week.  Banks also advanced as Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, reported first-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates as trading revenue more than doubled from
the fourth quarter.  Autonomy Advances  Autonomy Corp. jumped 7.4 percent to 1,620 pence after the
U.K.’s second-largest software company said analysts’ estimates
for its 2011 earnings will “turn out to be conservative.”  The firm today reported a 13 percent increase in first-
quarter sales to $220 million, beating the average analyst
estimate of $215 million.  TUI Travel Plc (TT/)  climbed 3 percent to 238.9 pence after

half-year results on May 10 should underpin full-year earnings
forecasts.  Vodafone, the world’s largest mobile phone company, dropped
4.3 percent to 169.1 pence, the biggest decline in almost a
year. KPN cut its 2011 profit forecast and plans to eliminate as
much as 25 percent of its workforce in the Netherlands by 2015.  CRH rallied 3.7 percent to 16.42 euros in Dublin trading

buildings material maker to its “conviction buy” list while

“overweight” recommendation.  Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients today that global
construction activity had bottomed with the growth in the
