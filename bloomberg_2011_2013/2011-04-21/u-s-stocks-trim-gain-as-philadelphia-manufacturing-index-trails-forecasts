U.S. stocks pared an early rally
after a gauge of manufacturing in the Philadelphia area
decreased more than economists’ forecast, tempering optimism
from higher-than-estimated earnings.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to
1,333.48 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York  after climbing 0.5 percent
earlier. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.31 points, or
less than 0.1 percent, to 12,457.84, erasing most of a 32-point
gain.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to 18.5 from 43.4 the prior month, which was the
highest level since 1984. Readings greater than zero signal
expansion in the area covering eastern Pennsylvania, southern
 New Jersey  and Delaware. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast the index would fall to 36.9, the median estimate in a
survey.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
