Russian meat and poultry
consumption may rise as much as 15 percent in the next few
years, according to OAO Cherkizovo Group, the country’s second-
largest poultry producer.  Meat demand may come to between 74 kilograms (163 pounds)
and 75 kilograms per capita in 2016, implying a gain of at least
14 percent from the current 65 kilograms, General Director
Sergei Mikhailov said today in Moscow, where the company is
based. Poultry consumption alone will increase 20 percent to 30
kilograms, he said.  Mikhailov spoke after a presentation for a new project in
the Lipetsk region that Cherkizovo expects to make it Russia’s
leading poultry producer in five years, with annual output of
more than 500,000 metric tons by live weight. The project will
include an egg incubator, a slaughterhouse and a feed-production
site, he said.  Imported poultry will have a 10 percent share of the
Russian market by the end of 2011, according to Mikhailov.
Cherkizovo expects beef imports to make up 25 percent of the
market and foreign pork to have a share of between 20 percent
and 25 percent, spokeswoman Irina Ostryakova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
