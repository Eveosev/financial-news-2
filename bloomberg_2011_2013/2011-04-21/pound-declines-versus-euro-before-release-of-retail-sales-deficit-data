The pound surged versus the dollar
as data showed retail sales unexpectedly rose and the U.K.
budget deficit was below economist estimates, buoying recovery
confidence and strengthening the case for higher  interest rates .  Britain’s currency also advanced against the euro after
data showed March retail sales rose 0.2 percent from a month
earlier as spending on food surged. The median forecast of 20
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.5 percent
decline. U.K. net borrowing was 18.6 billion pounds ($30.7
billion), compared with the 20 billion-pound median estimate in
a separate Bloomberg survey. Gilts rose after the U.K. Debt
Management Office cut planned sales by 1.5 billion pounds.  “We have speculation about a  Bank of England  rate hike
this year, maybe in the middle of the year, but the Federal
Reserve will probably keep its expansionary stance and we expect
the first hike only in the beginning of 2012,” said You-na Park, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“The BOE will probably begin its tightening this year so the
pound is able to gain against the dollar.”  The pound rose 1 percent to $1.6571 as of 4:49 p.m. in
London. Against the euro, sterling was 0.6 percent stronger at
88.01 pence, after earlier dropping as much as 0.3 percent.  Bank Minutes  The  Federal Reserve  will increase interest rates in the
first quarter of next year and the U.K. central bank will raise
borrowing costs before the end of the year, according to
Bloomberg surveys.  Minutes of the Bank of England’s April 7 meeting showed
policy makers voted 6-3 to keep the benchmark rate at a record
low 0.5 percent, amid concern that the past month’s data
indicated a weaker economy.  U.K. government bonds rose, pushing the 10-year gilt yield
four basis points lower to 3.53 percent. The two-year note yield
was two basis points lower at 1.13 percent, after reaching 1.12
percent, the lowest since Jan. 5.  The Debt Management Office will cut sales of short-dated
notes by 0.6 billion pounds to 57.4 billion, medium-dated debt
by 0.2 billion pounds to 34.7 billion, long-dated gilts by 0.3
billion pounds to 37.4 billion and inflation-protected
securities by 0.4 billion pounds to 38 billion, the agency said
today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
