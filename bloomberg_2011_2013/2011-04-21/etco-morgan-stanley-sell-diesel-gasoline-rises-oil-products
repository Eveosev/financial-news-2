Hess Corp.’s Hetco unit and Morgan
Stanley each sold a diesel cargo of 30,000 metric tons for at
least the second time this week.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  started a crude unit at its Pernis
oil refinery, Europe’s largest plant. European gasoline gained.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate delivery traded from $1,117 to
$1,128 a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts
pricing window. That’s more than yesterday’s highest-priced deal
at $1,110 a ton.  Chevron Corp. sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished vehicle fuel, for at least a fourth day.  Premium gasoline traded at $1,131 a ton, the survey
showed. That’s up by $6 a ton from yesterday’s highest deal on
the barge market, where lots are usually about 1,000 or 2,000
tons in size.  Middle Distillates  Hetco sold 30,000 tons of ultra low-sulfur diesel to Noble
Group Ltd. for delivery to Amsterdam from May 3 to May 7, the
survey showed. That deal was priced at a $16 premium to the May
gasoil futures on ICE, less than the $18 premium that Total SA
paid Hetco for a similar volume on April 18.  Hetco agreed to sell 10,000 tons of diesel to Vitol Group
for delivery to  London  Thames, the survey showed.  Morgan Stanley sold as much as 30,000 tons of diesel to
Saras SpA for delivery next month to Valencia,  Spain , the survey
showed. Morgan Stanley offloaded a similar volume to OAO
Lukoil’s Litasco unit at the start of this week.  Shell also sold its second diesel cargo of the week.
Greenergy International Ltd. will take delivery of the 10,000-
ton shipment next month at London Thames, agreeing to pay a $23
premium to May gasoil futures. Shell sold a summer-grade diesel
cargo to Mercuria Energy Trading SA on April 19.  Shell was the main buyer on the jet fuel barge market,
paying premiums on the two transactions of $86.50 and $87 to the
May gasoil contract.  About 1.2 million tons were shipped or provisionally booked
to sail in April to  Europe  from the Middle East and  India ,
according to a survey of five traders and brokers of jet fuel in
Europe and  Asia . That’s little changed from March.  Gasoil for May delivery was trading $3.50 lower at $1,017 a
ton as of 2:37 p.m. local time. It advanced earlier as much as
$10.25, or 1 percent, to $1,030.75 a ton on London’s ICE Futures
Europe exchange, the most since April 12. Gasoil is mainly used
in heating.  Heating oil barges were little changed from yesterday,
trading at a discount of $6 to May futures, the survey showed.
Summer grade diesel barges were also little changed, with lots
selling at a premium of $10 to May gasoil futures.  Residues  Barge deals on high-sulfur  fuel oil  were done from $644 a
ton to $645.50 a ton, the survey showed. That’s more than
yesterday’s highest deal at $641 a ton. The fuel, which contains
no more than 3.5 percent sulfur, is used mainly in shipping.  Refineries  Shell started crude unit 6 at its Pernis refinery today
following maintenance, according to two people with knowledge of
the work. Wim van de Wiel, a Shell spokesman based in  The Hague ,
declined to comment. Pernis in Rotterdam can process 416,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
