Billionaire  Vladimir Potanin  said
he backs OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky after United Co. Rusal criticized management.  “The management of the company, headed by Strzhalkovsky,
works properly and I am satisfied by the financial situation in
the company,” Potanin said today in an interview in Moscow.  Rusal presented a proposal to Norilsk’s board yesterday to
set up a committee to discuss marketing and another panel of
independent directors to cover corporate governance, Maxim Sokov, deputy CEO of the aluminum producer, said yesterday.  “We reduced the number of its committees two years ago and
Rusal voted for this decision,” Potanin said. A marketing panel
may end up spreading sensitive commercial information, he said.  Rusal CEO Oleg Deripaska, whose company controls 25 percent
of Norilsk, said yesterday the nickel producer may be short of
cash because of decisions including repeated share buy backs.  Deripaska and Potanin, both shareholders of Norilsk, spent
much of last year feuding over control of cash flows at  Russia ’s
biggest mining company. Deripaska this year spurned Norilsk’s
offer to buy back a 20 percent stake from Rusal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
