Hong Kong’s consumer prices rose
4.6 percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace
since August 2008, led by increases in the cost of food, rent
and cigarettes.  Today’s figure, released by the government on its
website, exceeded the 4.2 percent median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Consumer prices rose
3.7 percent in February.  Inflation is the main threat to the city’s economy,
Financial Secretary John Tsang said this week. Hong Kong’s
currency peg to the  U.S. dollar  robs the city of an
independent interest-rate policy as officials struggle to
limit the risk of a bubble in the real-estate market.  “Inflationary pressures are building on the back of
rising housing rentals, soaring oil and food prices,” Joanne Yim, a Hong Kong-based economist at Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said
before today’s data. A “trend of rising price pressure seems
unlikely to reverse.”  Yim predicts inflation will accelerate to an annual 4.7
percent pace in 2011, more than the government’s estimate of
4.5 percent.  Food, private housing rentals and an increase in tobacco
duty contributed to the jump in the consumer-price index, the
government said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
