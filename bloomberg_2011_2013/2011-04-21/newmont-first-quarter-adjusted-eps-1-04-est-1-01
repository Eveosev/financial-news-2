Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, posted first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after the metal’s price rose to a record.  Net income dropped to $514 million, or $1.03 a share, from
$546 million, or $1.11, a year earlier, the  Greenwood Village ,
Colorado-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding some items were $1.04 a share, exceeding the $1
average estimate from 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 9.9 percent to $2.47 billion.  Newmont, led by Chief Executive Officer Richard O’Brien,
operates mines in the U.S., Indonesia and  Australia . Gold prices
have risen for 10 straight years and averaged $1,388 an ounce in
the quarter, 25 percent more than a year earlier.  Newmont rose 22 cents to $58.85 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. The company has climbed 13 percent
in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
