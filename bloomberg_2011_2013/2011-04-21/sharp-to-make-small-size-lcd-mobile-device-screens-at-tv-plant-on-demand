Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, will start making smaller screens at
a television-panel plant to meet demand for mobile devices.  Sharp will produce small- and medium-sized displays using
oxide semiconductors at its No. 2 plant in  Kameyama  city,
central Japan, by the end of the year, the Osaka-based company
said in a statement today. The factory will continue to produce
TV panels, according to the statement.  “It makes sense for Sharp to focus more on smaller panels
where the demand-supply balance has been tight,”  Shiro
Mikoshiba , an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said by
telephone. Stiff competition in large panels will likely
continue due to sluggish demand for LCD TVs, he said.  Sharp suspended operations at its two biggest LCD factories
earlier this month because of a shortage of gas needed for
production. The company is prioritizing the use of scarce
materials to make smaller-sized LCDs because of stronger demand,
Sharp said April 11.  Its so-called eighth-generation  production line  at Kameyama
was started in 2006 and is designed to make 40-inch and 50-inch
panels.  Sharp rose 1.4 percent to 753 yen at the 3 p.m. close of
trading in  Tokyo . Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
