A U.K.  task force  headed by Peter
Rogers, the London Development Agency’s chief executive officer,
has concluded that London Mayor  Boris Johnson  should create a
company to boost housing development, the Financial Times
reported, citing a draft of the group’s recommendations that
it’s reviewed.  The task force says Johnson’s target of 134,000 new London
homes in the next four years will require 34 billion pounds ($56
billion) of investment, and bringing London’s stock of social
housing up to an acceptable standard will cost 1.5 billion
pounds, the newspaper reported.  Public-sector investment is unlikely at a time of spending
cuts and commercial companies will be cautious, given economic
uncertainty, the group says; one recommendation is therefore
creation by the mayor of a housing and property company, to use
public land with support from builders and residential managers,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
