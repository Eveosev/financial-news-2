Aston Villa manager  Gerard Houllier 
is in comfortable condition after being admitted to the hospital
last night, the Premier League soccer club said.  Houllier, 63, is currently undergoing tests and is expected
to remain hospitalized for “several days,” Villa said in a
 statement  on its website without giving specific details.  Assistant manager Gary McAllister will take charge of the
team for its Premier League match against Stoke in two days, the
club said.  “I spoke with him this morning, as did Gary before he took
training, and he sounded very positive,” Villa Chief Executive
Paul Faulkner said.  Houllier was hired at Villa on Sept. 9, one month after
 Martin O’Neill  unexpectedly resigned. He’s come under criticism
from some Villa fans for the team’s inconsistent form which has
it in 10th place.  Houllier managed Liverpool from 1998-2004, winning the F.A.
Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup titles in 2001. That same year he
had open-heart surgery which led to a five-month break from the
game.  He’s also coached Lens, Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon and
was the technical director for the French Football Federation
before joining Villa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
