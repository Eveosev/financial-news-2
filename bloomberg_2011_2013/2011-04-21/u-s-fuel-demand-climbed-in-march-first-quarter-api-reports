U.S. fuel demand rose in March as
prices climbed to the highest level in 30 months amid signs the
economy is rebounding, according to the  American Petroleum
Institute .  Total deliveries of petroleum products, a measure of
demand, climbed 7.3 percent to 20.5 million barrels a day last
month from a year earlier, the industry-funded group said today
in a report. First-quarter deliveries gained 5.5 percent from
the year-earlier period.  Gasoline consumption increased 6.1 percent to 9.32 million
barrels a day from the same month last year as first-quarter
usage rose 4.1 percent to 9.01 million.  “The positive economic effects are outweighing some of the
price effects,”  John Felmy , chief economist with the
Washington-based API, said in a telephone interview.  Demand for distillate fuel rose 11 percent to 4.28 million
barrels a day in March. Consumption of ultra-low sulfur diesel,
the type used on highways, climbed 21 percent to average 3.29
million barrels a day, the report showed. Quarterly figures
showed distillate demand up 8 percent to 4.09 million. Ultra-low
sulfur diesel use rose 13 percent to 3.24 million.  Heating oil consumption surged 72 percent to 917,000
barrels a day in March and 40 percent in the first quarter to
819,000 barrels.  Jet-fuel use climbed 2.2 percent to an average 1.48 million
barrels a day last month. It gained 2.7 percent in the quarter
to 1.42 million.  API also reported record refinery production in both March
and the first quarter. Gasoline output jumped 4.9 percent in
March, and distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil
and diesel increased 22 percent.  “There’s a lot of product out there, it just costs more to
make,” Felmy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
