Haitong Securities Co.,  China ’s
third-largest brokerage by market value, suspended trading of
its shares in Shanghai from today, saying the company was in
discussions on an “important matter.”  The company’s shares will resume trading on April 26, it
said in a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange, without
elaborating. Jin Xiaobin, board secretary of Haitong, wasn’t
immediately available for comment.  Shanghai-based Haitong and Sydney-based Macquarie Group Ltd.
are in early discussions to form an investment banking and
securities joint venture, Reuters reported on April 13.  Shares of Haitong have gained 5.7 percent this year,
compared with a 7.8 percent increase in the benchmark Shanghai
Composite Index.  --Luo Jun. Editor: Russell Ward  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
