Italian companies, including Enel
Green Power, may halt investment in renewable-energy projects in
 Bulgaria  after a new law is passed, the  Sofia Echo  reported,
citing John Clark, country manager of Enel Bulgaria.  The renewable-energy bill in parliament creates regulatory
uncertainty and, together with a lack of grid infrastructure,
makes investment too risky, the newspaper said, citing Italian
investors.  Enel Green Power operates two 21-megawatt wind farms in
northeast Bulgaria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
