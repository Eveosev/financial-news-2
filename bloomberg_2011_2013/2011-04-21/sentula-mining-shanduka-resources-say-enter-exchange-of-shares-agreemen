Sentula Mining Ltd. (SNU) , the South
African contract-mining services provider, agreed to a takeover
by Shanduka Resources Ltd. in a shares-for-assets swap valued at
2.1 billion rand ($312 million).  Sentula will issue shares representing 51.9 percent of the
company to  Shanduka Group  Ltd.’s resources unit in exchange for
29.9 percent of Shanduka Coal Ltd. and all of Shanduka Coal
Investments Ltd., including its 29.9 percent of Kangra Coal
Ltd., Johannesburg-based Sentula said in a statement today.  The deal increases access to financing for Sentula, which
had a rights offer last year, and gives black-investor company
Shanduka Group, led by Cyril Ramaphosa, more coal deposits. The
companies will develop coal projects to benefit from prices for
the fuel, which doubled to $124.36 a metric ton in the past two
years at  Richards Bay ,  Africa ’s biggest coal export terminal,
according to IHS McCloskey data on Bloomberg.  Glencore International AG owns the rest of Shanduka Coal,
which produced 9.1 million tons of unprocessed coal last year,
and Gas Natural Fenosa SDG SA owns the rest of Kangra Coal,
which produced 4.1 million tons and has the right to export 2
million tons annually through Richards Bay. Fenosa has a pre-
emptive right to Shanduka’s Kangra stake, Sentula said.  Sentula rose 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 2.91 rand by 12:37
p.m. in Johannesburg, giving it a value of 1.7 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
