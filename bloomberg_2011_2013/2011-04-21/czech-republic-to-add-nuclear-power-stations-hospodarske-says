The  Czech Republic  will probably
build more nuclear power stations after it adds two planned
reactors to the Temelin plant,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported,
citing Martin Pecina, chief executive officer of Vitkovice
Nuclear Power.  The country will need new sources of energy in the coming
decades as it phases out old coal-fired plants, the newspaper
said, citing an interview with Pecina.  The recent disaster at  Japan â€™s Fukushima plant is unlikely
to derail long-term plans to build more reactors, Hospodarske
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
