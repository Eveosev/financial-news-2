Cattle futures dropped for a second
day on speculation that a government report will show increasing
U.S. supplies of the animals. Hog prices also fell.  Feedlot purchases probably rose 4.2 percent in March from a
year earlier, a Bloomberg survey showed. The Department of
Agriculture will release feedlot data at 3 p.m. in  Washington .
In  Texas , the largest U.S. producer, drought in more than 60
percent of the state is “extreme” or “exceptional,” the
University of  Nebraska ’s U.S. Drought Monitor said. Scorched
pastures have prompted ranchers to sell more young animals.  “A little bit higher placement” of cattle into feedlots
is expected in the USDA report “due to the drought down
south,” said Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory Services in
Waucoma,  Iowa . “That’s pressuring these cattle futures.”  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.75 cent, or 0.6
percent, to $1.1575 a pound at 12:01 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A close at that price would reduce this
week’s gain to 0.4 percent.  Before today, the commodity gained 23 percent in the past
year as increasing feed costs, including a doubling in corn
prices, curbed herd expansion.  Hog futures for June settlement dropped 0.825 cent, or 0.8
percent, to $1.00575 a pound in  Chicago . Before today, prices
are up 19 percent in the past 12 months.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slumped 1.2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $1.37275 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
