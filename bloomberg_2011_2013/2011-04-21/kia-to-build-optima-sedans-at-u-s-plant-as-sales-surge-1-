Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  plans to begin
building Optima sedans at a U.S. plant in Georgia, adding about
1,000 workers, as the South Korean automaker aims to boost sales
in the market to a record this year.  Production of the midsize car will start in late 2011 at
the West Point, Georgia, factory, Tom Loveless, the Seoul-based
company’s vice president for U.S. sales, said today at the New
York International Auto Show. The goal is build as many as
150,000 Optimas a year, Byung Mo Ahn, Kia’s chief executive
officer for U.S. operations, said.  “We want to get all Optimas for the U.S. from the plant,”
Ahn said in an interview in  New York . “We’ve already begun
preparing to build it.”  Kia’s U.S. sales jumped 37 percent in the first quarter,
outstripping the industry’s 20 percent increase. The gains have
been led by the revamped Optima, added in 2010, as well as
models such as the Soul wagon, Forte small car and Sorento and
Sportage crossovers introduced within the past two years.  The automaker today showed the subcompact Rio hatchback and
sedan that go on sale later this year.  Kia “has a shot” of eventually selling about 100,000
Optimas in the U.S. annually, Loveless said. After selling a
record 356,268 total vehicles last year, the automaker’s U.S.
sales should exceed 400,000 in 2011, he said.  More Employees  Adding Optima production will increase employment at Kia’s
 Georgia  plant to about 3,000 workers, Ahn said.  The plant has avoided production cuts announced at North
American factories run by Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co.
and Nissan Motor Co. after  Japan ’s March 11 earthquake disrupted
supply of some parts.  Kia’s plant relies on South Korean suppliers for almost all
of its components and gets “very little” from Japan, Ahn said.  Kia is the second-largest South Korean automaker, behind
affiliate  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  Kia’s Georgia plant can build as
many as 300,000 vehicles a year and already produces the Sorento
and Hyundai’s Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle.  Kia’s U.S. sales unit is in Irvine,  California . The
company’s shares rose 600 won, or 0.8 percent, today to 77,300
won in Korea Stock Exchange trading in  Seoul , a 52-week high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
