Strabag SE (STR) , an Austrian builder,
called on  Kenya ’s government to reconsider canceling its toll
road concession in Nairobi, the capital of the East African
country.  “We are very disappointed by the ministry’s course of
action which costs so much time and money for the Kenyan
people,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today. “We
remain committed to the project.”  Strabag said it received a cancellation letter for the
Nairobi project from the Kenyan Ministry of Roads. Kenyan
government spokesman  Alfred Mutua  said the project stalled after
the World Bank backed out of providing money. It was looking at
other options to finance the road, he said by phone from
Nairobi.  The government invited Chinese contractors to take over
construction of the 67 billion-shilling ($800-million) highway,
Business Daily reported Feb. 7. The  World Bank  on Feb. 2 said it
won’t finance the project after conducting a review and due
diligence study, although it would reconsider Strabag’s
concession if it agreed to “expand its integrity compliance
procedures and training programs.”  Strabag is committed to comply with the higher compliance
standards, Diana Neumuller-Klein, a company spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed response to questions today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
