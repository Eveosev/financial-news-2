The U.S. and  Japan  are more at risk
of sovereign-debt crises than financial markets currently
signal, according to Rabobank International.  The bank’s sovereign vulnerability index ranks Japan as the
second most vulnerable and the U.S. as fifth, while credit-
default swaps rank Japan seventh and the U.S. the 11th, Shahin Kamalodin, an international economist at Rabobank, wrote in a
report to clients today. Rabobank agrees with the market that
Greece is the most threatened by the potential for debt turmoil.  The index is based on eight indicators including the gap
between  interest rates  and growth, budget-deficit levels,
current-account balances and the maturities of existing
securities.  “The most noteworthy observation is that debt-ridden Japan
is the most vulnerable to a sovereign-debt crisis after
 Greece ,” said Kamalodin, who is based in the Dutch city of
Utrecht. “Interestingly, the large structural deficit of the
U.S. puts it ahead of  Spain  and  Italy  and our index, which is
not the case according to the CDS spreads.”  The index suggests investors should be less concerned about
crises in Ireland,  Belgium  and Spain than credit-default swaps
indicate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
