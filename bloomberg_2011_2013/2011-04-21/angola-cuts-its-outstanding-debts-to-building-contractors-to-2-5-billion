Angola  reduced its outstanding debt
to building contractors to $2.5 billion at the end of the first
quarter, the southern African nation’s government said.  The remaining debt to contractors that helped rebuild
infrastructure after a civil war will be paid through the issue
of kwanza-denominated bonds and $1 billion in cash, the
government said in a report published today in the Luanda-based
Jornal de Angola.  Angola’s foreign reserves rose to $18.2 billion at the end
of March from $17.7 billion in December because of increased
revenue from higher  oil prices , the government said. Angola is
sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
