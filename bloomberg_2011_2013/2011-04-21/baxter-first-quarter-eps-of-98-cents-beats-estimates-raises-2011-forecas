Baxter International Inc. (BAX) , the
maker of blood products and intravenous drugs, raised its full-
year forecast after reporting quarterly profit that beat
analysts’ estimates. The shares rose in trading today.  Profit this year is expected to be $4.20 to $4.28 a share
before special items, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company said
in a statement today. Baxter previously forecast earnings of
$4.15 to $4.25 a share.  Worldwide sales jumped 5 percent from 2010, excluding
adjustments for currency exchange and for sales of an infusion
pump. Baxter bought privately held Prism Pharmaceuticals, the
maker of intravenous heart drugs, in April, and agreed to
purchase hemophilia-related assets of Archemix in November,
boosting its IV and blood medications.  The “overall earnings quality was solid,” wrote  Michael Weinstein , an analyst for JP Morgan in  New York , in a note to
investors today.  Baxter reported first-quarter profit of 98 cents a share, 5
cents higher than the estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The shares rose $2.07, or 3.8 percent, to $56.59 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Baxter had fallen
7.5 percent in the 12 months before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
