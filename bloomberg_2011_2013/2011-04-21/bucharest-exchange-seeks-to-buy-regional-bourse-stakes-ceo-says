The Bucharest Stock Exchange wants
to buy stakes in east European bourses, as part of a plan to
overtake the Prague and Budapest exchanges in the next two
years, Chief Executive Officer Valentin Ionescu said.  The Romanian exchange plans to spend 5 million euros ($7.3
million) this year on majority or minority stakes in other
bourses, possibly in Albania, Bulgaria, Moldova or  Serbia ,
Ionescu said in a phone interview today.  “We seek regional expansion, so as to become a noteworthy
exchange in two to three years,” he said. “Look at the Vienna
exchange, which has built a common platform for central  Europe .
I say, why can’t we do the same for eastern Europe?”  The Bucharest exchange’s market capitalization stands at
about 29 billion euros, while Vienna bourse’s CEE Stock Exchange
Group, which includes holdings in the Ljubljana, Budapest and
Prague exchanges, is valued at 157 billion euros. The  Warsaw
Stock Exchange (GPW) , the most active bourse in the post-communist
region after Moscow, is worth 218 billion euros.  Bucharest’s benchmark BET Index has risen 13 percent so far
this year. Budapest, too, has climbed 13 percent. Prague and
Warsaw are up 1.6 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively.  East European countries are set to expand twice as fast as
the eurozone this year after their worst recession in two
decades, according to the  World Bank  and the  International
Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
