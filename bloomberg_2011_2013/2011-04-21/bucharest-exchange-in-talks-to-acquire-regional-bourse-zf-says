The  Bucharest Stock Exchange  is in
talks to buy a smaller exchange in eastern  Europe , including
possibly the Serbian or Moldovan bourses,  Ziarul Financiar 
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Valentin Ionescu.  The exchange, which had about 16 million euros ($23
million) in bank deposits last year, wants to become an
emerging-market bourse and shed its frontier-market status, the
Bucharest-based newspaper said, citing Ionescu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
