Jess Jackson , owner of the
Preakness Stakes-winning thoroughbreds Curlin and Rachel
Alexandra, died today at age 81 of cancer, according to a
statement from his family.  Jackson, the founder of  Kendall-Jackson  winery whose
thoroughbreds won Horse of the Year for three consecutive
seasons, passed away at his home in Geyserville,  California .  Jackson entered the horse racing industry later in life,
and in 2007 purchased a majority stake in Curlin, a stallion
that won the Preakness Stakes and the Breeders’ Cup Classic that
same year. In 2009, Jackson’s Rachel Alexandra became the first
filly since 1924 to win the Preakness.  Curlin was named Horse of the Year in 2007 and 2008 and
amassed $10.5 million in prize money.  Rachel Alexandra  went
undefeated in 2009 and won Horse of the Year honors that same
year. In February, the two horses were bred in Lexington,
 Kentucky .  Jess Stonestreet Jackson grew up in  San Francisco  and paid
his own way through law school at the  University of California,
Berkley . After working as a farmer, longshoreman, policeman and
land-use lawyer, Jackson converted his family’s 80-acre pear and
walnut orchard in Lakeport, California, into a vineyard.  The Kendall-Jackson winery produced its first bottle in
1982 and in 1983 won the first Double Platinum award ever
presented by the American Wine Competition. The label became the
best-selling Chardonnay in America for over two decades,
according to the statement.  He is survived by his wife, Barbara Banke, and five
children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
