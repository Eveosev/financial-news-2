Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  is seeking 20
million metric tons of the fuel in May as part of its planned
imports of 250 million tons of coal over a decade.  The world’s biggest coal producer may award the contract
for this year’s first batch of imports to be delivered starting
July, said a Coal  India  official, who declined to be identified
because the tender is confidential. The company had received
responses from about 26 companies to supply coal under a long-
term contract, he said. The tender in May will specify quantity,
grades, prices and volume, according to the official.  India’s need for coal has been spurred by the expansion of
power generation and steel-making capacity to meet demand in
 Asia ’s second-fastest growing major economy. State-owned Coal
India has carried forward 60 billion rupees ($1.4 billion) for
overseas acquisitions after the amount wasn’t used in the year
ended March 31, Chairman N.C. Jha said yesterday. The company
plans to acquire mines in Australia, Indonesia and the U.S.  To contact the reporters on this story:
