China , the world’s largest energy
user, boosted net exports of gasoline and diesel last month as
domestic refiners increased shipments to benefit from rising
overseas prices.  Net gasoline exports grew 17 percent to 469,990 metric tons
from a month earlier, according to data released by the Beijing-
based General Administration of Customs today. Net diesel
shipments climbed to 170,000 tons from 120 tons in February.  China caps prices of gasoline, diesel and kerosene to curb
their impact on inflation. The value of diesel exports increased
to $873.5 a ton in March from $817.2 a ton in February, while
gasoline rose to $849.4 a ton from $828.3 a ton, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on the customs data.  “Chinese  oil companies  are more willing to sell oil
products to foreign markets to gain from rising prices there,”
Yang Guangming, a director of energy and chemical research at
Hangzhou-based Nanhua Futures Co Ltd., said by mobile phone.  China became a net exporter of kerosene for the first time
in three months, after exports more than doubled to 700,000 tons
in March from February and imports gained 27 percent to 430,000
tons, the customs data show.  --Winnie Zhu. With assistance from Chua Baizhen in Beijing.
