Slovenia’s benchmark stock index
fell to its lowest level since February 2004 as the euro region
nation faces a political crisis that may lead to early
elections.  The SBITOP index of the six most-traded securities on the
Ljubljana stock exchange dropped 3.7 percent to 759.31 points,
the lowest level since Feb. 24, 2004.  “The main reason for the drop is the political crisis in
the country,” Jernej Kozlevcar, a  fund manager  at Triglav Asset
Management Co. in Ljubljana said in a phone interview today.
“There was a presentation of main Slovenian companies today and
we didn’t hear any positive news from them as well.”  Slovenia may face an early vote after the pensioners party
threatened to leave the four-way coalition of Prime Minister
Borut Pahor. That would leave the government with only 42
lawmakers in the 90-member parliament. The pensioners’ party,
also known as Desus, said it will make the final decision on
leaving the government on May 6. Elections in Slovenia are
scheduled for autumn next year.  Slovenian companies, including drugmaker Krka Group d.d.,
phone company Telekom Slovenije d.d. and the lender Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d gave a presentation, organized by the
Ljubljana stock exchange, to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
