Brazilian stocks were downgraded to
“equal-weight” at Morgan Stanley and “underweight” at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. on interest-rate increases and earnings. Morgan
Stanley upgraded Colombian equities.  Brazil ’s “earnings revisions” and earnings growth have
fallen relative to other markets,  Jonathan Garner , Morgan
Stanley’s chief Asia and emerging-markets strategist in  Hong
Kong , and analysts wrote in a research note. The U.S. bank
previously had an “overweight” rating on Brazil.  The downgrade at JPMorgan was by  Adrian Mowat , the bank's 
Hong Kong-based chief Asia and emerging-markets strategist.   Monetary tightening and uncertainties about Brazil’s
economic policy are among the factors weighing on economic
growth and earnings, Emy Shayo, a Sao Paulo-based Brazil equity
strategist for JPMorgan, wrote in a report dated April 20. The
country’s gross domestic product grew 7.5 percent in 2010.  The central bank raised the benchmark interest rate a
quarter point to 12 percent yesterday. The rate was 8.75 percent
at the start of 2010. Consumer growth will be hurt by higher
credit costs, according to the JPMorgan note.  “Earnings growth expectations are low (below 10 percent)
for 2011, in line with nominal GDP,” Shayo wrote.  Morgan Stanley raised Colombian equities to “equal-
weight” from “underweight.” The country’s stocks will benefit
from “consistent positive earnings revision,” “supportive”
global conditions and “strong” domestic demand, according to
Morgan Stanley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
