South Africa’s Cabinet endorsed the
Department of Mineral Resources’ decision to declare a
moratorium on natural-gas drilling in the Karoo region, halting
plans by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s largest oil company.  The department will lead an investigation into the
implications of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that will
include assessing the environmental effects, government
spokesman Jimmy Manyi told reporters in Pretoria today.  “Cabinet has made it very clear that a clean environment
together with all the ecological aspects will not be
compromised,” Manyi said. The cabinet is aware of the “urgency
that is required in this respect,” he added.  Royal Dutch Shell applied for permission to drill about 24
wells in an area of about 90,000 square kilometers (34,749
square miles). The company faces opposition in the sheep- and
game-farming region, an arid stretch across northwest  South
Africa , from the Treasure the Karoo Action Group, which fears
environmental damage.  Shell would seek clarity from the minerals department on
the “full implications” of the moratorium, the company said in
an e-mailed statement.  “Shell will support local research efforts into hydraulic
fracturing as this will provide clarity and an improved
understanding of the technology,” the company said. “Shell is
fully committed to support the development of best-in-class
regulatory standards for hydraulic fracturing in South Africa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
