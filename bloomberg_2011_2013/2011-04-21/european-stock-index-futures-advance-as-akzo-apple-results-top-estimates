European stocks rose for a third
day, extending the benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s weekly
gain, after earnings from  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  to  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  exceeded
analysts’ estimates.  Akzo Nobel soared 4 percent after the world’s biggest maker
of paints reported increased first-quarter profit.  William Hill
Plc (WMH)  surged 7.5 percent as the bookmaker’s operating income rose.
Finnish steelmaker  Rautaruukki Oyj (RTRKS)  rallied the most since July
after forecasting higher revenue and prices. Royal KPN NV sank
8.3 percent after lowering its outlook.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.5 percent to 280.47 at the 4:30
p.m. close in London. The gauge has risen 1 percent this week
after results from  Intel Corp . to PSA Peugeot Citroen and
L’Oreal SA spurred investor optimism in the economic recovery.
European markets will be closed for a holiday tomorrow.  “Better-than-expected earnings do give confidence the
recovery is accelerating, especially when companies lift their
guidance for the next quarter,” said Markus Huber, head of
German sales trading at ETX Capital in  London . “Accelerating
economic growth should be able to overcome the rise in commodity
prices and be moderately impacted.”  Of the 35 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since April 11, 22 have beaten analyst estimates for
per-share profit, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In
the  S&P 500 , 81 percent have topped projections.  Apple Earnings  Apple, the maker of the iPhone and iPad, said net income in
its fiscal second quarter rose to $5.99 billion, or $6.40 a
share, from $3.07 billion a year earlier. Sales jumped 83
percent to $24.7 billion. Analysts had predicted profit of $5.39
a share on sales of $23.4 billion, according to the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. General Electric Co. and Morgan
Stanley also released results that exceeded projections.  “Earnings are good and give investors confidence so
European equity markets could rise in the short term,” said
 Markus Steinbeis , head of equity portfolio management at the
Unterfoehring, Germany-based unit of Pioneer Investments KGmbH,
which oversees about $221 billion globally. “I don’t think this
huge rally will continue in the summer months. The environment
is getting riskier and riskier.”  European stocks pared their advance as the Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index for April fell
more than forecast. Even so, the Conference Board’s gauge of
U.S. leading indicators increased for a ninth month in March,
signaling higher fuel costs will fail to derail the expansion.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes rose in 11 of the 15 western
European markets that were open today.  Germany ’s DAX climbed 0.6
percent and  France ’s CAC 40 added 0.4 percent, while the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 fell less than 0.1 percent. Exchanges in Norway,
Denmark and Iceland were closed for a holiday.  Akzo Nobel jumped 4 percent to 52.48 euros, the highest
price since June 2008. The company reported first-quarter net
income of 128 million euros ($187 million). That topped the
average analyst estimate of 104.7 million euros, based on 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  William Hill surged 7.5 percent to 213.3 pence, the largest
advance in six months and the biggest gain in the Stoxx 600
today. The U.K. bookmaker with about 2,350 shops said first-
quarter net revenue gained 11 percent, boosted by a 26 percent
increase in online sales.  Rautaruukki rose 5.7 percent to 17.52 euros, the biggest
gain since July 16. The Finnish steelmaker said full-year sales
will grow about 25 percent, compared with an earlier forecast of
20 percent to 25 percent.  Autonomy Advances  Autonomy Corp. posted the second-biggest rally in the Stoxx
600, rising 7.4 percent to 1,620 pence. The U.K.’s second-
largest software company reiterated that analyst estimates for
2011 are “conservative” as customers increase expenditure. Net
income advanced 9 percent to $54.2 million, beating analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Banking shares rose 1.5 percent as a group, the biggest
gain among 19 industries in the Stoxx 600, as Morgan Stanley
reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates after
trading revenue more than doubled from the fourth quarter.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest bank, gained 1.2
percent to 659.6 pence, while  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s biggest
lender, advanced 1.7 percent to 51.42 euros. UniCredit SpA
rallied 4.5 percent to 1.69 euros, ending the longest falling
streak since January.  Lafarge, CRH  Lafarge SA (LG)  gained 1.6 percent to 47.14 euros as the world’s
largest cement maker was raised to “buy” from “neutral” at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  CRH Plc (CRH)  climbed 3.7 percent to 16.42
euros after the second-biggest building-materials maker was also
upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by Goldman Sachs. The
company was also rated “overweight” in new coverage at
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Dragon Oil Plc (DGO)  soared 3.7 percent to 566 pence after the
explorer focused on  Turkmenistan  said it plans to increase
production as much as 20 percent this year, more than previously
forecast, on new pipeline infrastructure.  KPN tumbled 8.3 percent to 10.78 euros, the biggest decline
since October 2008. The largest Dutch telephone company cut its
2011 profit forecast and plans to eliminate as much as 25
percent of its workforce in the Netherlands by 2015.  Accor SA (AC) , Europe’s largest hotel company, sank 4 percent to
30.20 euros after competitor Marriott International Inc. posted
first-quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
