Asia  fuel oil  losses increased by
the most in two weeks as refiners raised processing rates,
boosting supplies. Gasoil profits dropped for a third week.
Naphtha margins increased as prices climbed for a fifth week.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil gained 0.2 percent this
week to $683.75 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as
marine fuel, rose 0.6 percent this week to $670.25 a ton. No oil
trading will take place tomorrow on the Platts pricing system in
Singapore because of a public holiday.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened this week by
$2.11, or 24 percent, to $10.90 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.
Weekly losses are the highest since April 8.  The viscosity spread, or difference between prices of the
less-viscous 180-centistoke fuel oil used at  power plants , and
the lower-quality 380-centistoke bunker grade, fell by $2.70 to
$13.50 a barrel this week, Bloomberg data showed.  BP Plc bought 20,000 tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil for
loading May 11 to May 15 from Chevron Corp. at a premium of $3 a
ton over benchmark prices. BP bought 20,000 tons of the same
grade for loading May 17 to May 21 from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at
a premium of $4 a ton.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose 1.3 percent

the same period.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell 47

cents to 80 cents a barrel this week, data from PVM Oil

0.5 percent sulfur, for loading May 6 to May 10, from Shell at a

with 10 parts per million of sulfur, for loading May 14 to May

15.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline rose 2.5 percent to $129.35 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha
climbed 60 cents this week to $11.70 a barrel. A wider reforming
margin signals that the profit from making gasoline over naphtha
is increasing.  PetroChina Co. sold 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline
loading May 6 to May 10 to Vitol Group at $129.40 a barrel.
