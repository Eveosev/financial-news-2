PG&E Corp. (PCG) , owner of  California ’s
largest utility, named a board member, Lee Cox, interim chairman
and chief executive officer to replace Peter A. Darbee, who is
stepping down following the fatal San Bruno pipeline blast last
year.  Darbee, 58, also serves as president and will retire
effective April 30, San Francisco-based PG&E said today in a
statement. Cox has been a member of the company’s board since
1996 and is a former vice chairman of AirTouch Communications
Inc. and a former CEO of AirTouch Cellular.  Eight people died and more than 30 homes were destroyed
after a pipeline owned by PG&E exploded in San Bruno,
California, on Sept. 9. PG&E, which is facing scrutiny from
state regulators, has said it strengthened its natural-gas
operations and revised instructions for responding to
emergencies after the explosion.  “Peter concluded that a change in leadership would create
the best opportunity for PG&E to move ahead after a challenging
year,” Cox said in today’s statement. “The board supported his
decision.”  Cox, 70, said the search for Darbee’s successor is under
way, with an announcement expected soon. Darbee joined PG&E in
1999 as chief financial officer and became CEO in 2005. He took
on the role of chairman in 2006.  PG&E was unchanged in after-hours trading in  New York  at
$45.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
