Oil traded near its highest price
in 10 days in  New York  as signs of an improving economy in the
U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer, stoked speculation
that demand for fuel may increase.  Futures for June delivery climbed as much as 0.9 percent as
the dollar slumped to a 15-month low against the euro and equity
markets rallied after Apple Inc.’s profit beat projections. The
Energy Department reported an unexpected drop in U.S. crude
supplies and a decline in gasoline supplies yesterday. Prices
trimmed gains today after a U.S. report showed a smaller-than
forecast decline in initial jobless claims last week.  “Oil’s gaining today from a combination of the strong euro
and continuing good news from the stock markets,” said  Robert Montefusco , senior broker at Sucden Financial in London.
“Yesterday’s Energy Department numbers helped a lot, and we
should get a pick-up in demand over the next month as the
holidays approach.”  Crude oil for June delivery gained as much as $1.03 to
$112.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest price since April 11. It was at
$111.71 at 1:37 p.m. London time. Brent crude oil for June
settlement traded at $123.91 a barrel, up 6 cents, on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London. Yesterday, it rose $2.52, or
2.1 percent, to end the session at $123.85, the highest close
since April 11.  Trading on both platforms will be closed tomorrow for the
Easter vacation.  Crude Inventories  The European benchmark’s premium to U.S. futures narrowed
to $12.21 a barrel from $12.40 yesterday. The difference between
front-month contracts in  London  and New York surged to a record
$19.54 on Feb. 21. The spread averaged 76 cents last year. The
dollar fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1.4649 against the euro
in London, the weakest since December 2009.  U.S. crude oil supplies fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million last week, the first drop since February, the Energy
Department said yesterday in a weekly report. Inventories were
forecast to increase by 1.3 million barrels, according to the
median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.58 million barrels to 208.1
million, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 12, the
report showed. Stockpiles were forecast to decline by 1.75
million barrels, according to the survey.  “We had better-than-expected earnings yesterday for the
technology sector and that supports the idea that demand seems
intact despite concerns over higher commodity prices,” said
Serene Lim, a commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “The bullish inventory report
overnight will bolster the market today.”  Middle East  Oil has advanced 22 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North  Africa  has toppled leaders in Egypt
and Tunisia and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen. Libyan crude output, which averaged 1.6 million
barrels a day last year, fell to 390,000 barrels a day in March,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  At least 153 people died across northern  Nigeria  in riots
by supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who lost
the April 16 presidential vote in Africa’s top oil-producing
country, a civil rights group said yesterday. Attacks by armed
groups cut more than 28 percent of the country’s output between
2006 and 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
