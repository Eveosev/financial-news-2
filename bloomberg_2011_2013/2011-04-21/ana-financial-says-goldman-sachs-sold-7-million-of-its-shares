Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  reduced
its stake in  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , and shares of the South
Korean company declined.  Goldman Sachs sold 7.5 million shares for 322.5 billion won
($298 million), according to terms of the deal obtained by
Bloomberg. The New York-based bank sold the shares at 43,000 won
apiece, or 6.5 percent less than their closing price yesterday,
said Hana Financial spokesman Lee Jung Dae. Goldman Sachs
spokesman Christopher Jun declined to comment on the transaction.  The Wall Street bank may want to recoup cash from its
investments worldwide for its common stock holders after
announcing a 21 percent drop in first-quarter profit earlier
this week, said analyst Jun Jae Gon. Hana fell as much as 4.8
percent, the most since Feb. 11, and traded 3.2 percent lower at
44,550 won as of 11:49 a.m. on the Korea Exchange.  “Investors seem to be concerned about stock overhang in
the market after Goldman Sachs’ block sale at a discount,
pressuring the shares today,” said Jun, an analyst at Meritz
Securities Co. in  Seoul .  The U.S. bank’s earnings per share, which include the cost
of preferred dividend payments to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., slid to $1.56 last quarter from $5.59, it said on
April 19.  Lee said  Hana Financial  was aware of Goldman Sachs’ sale
plan ahead of the transaction and it understands the sale is the
firm’s effort to recoup profit from its 2005 investment in the
South Korean company.  Goldman Sachs held about 7.6 percent of Hana Financial
before today’s stake sale, according to Hana. Goldman Sachs had
an 8.66 percent stake as of December, or 18.3 million shares,
which was diluted after Hana sold 31.2 million new shares in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
