Bulgaria plans to spend 2 billion
lev ($1.5 billion) by 2020 to acquire military equipment that
meets the requirements of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  The 13 projects that are part of the plan include the
purchase of eight fighter jets, new weapons and navigation
systems for the navy, and telecommunications and computer
systems for ground and air forces, Defense Minister Anyu Angelov
said at a press conference in Sofia today.  “If we can ensure average annual defense spending of 1.5
percent of gross domestic product over the next nine years, that
should be enough to cover the minimum needed to modernize the
military,” Angelov said.  The government reduced the size of the military last year
to narrow the  budget deficit  to below 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product this year from 3.9 percent in 2010, in line
with European Union limits. Bulgaria cut defense spending to 1.3
percent of GDP in 2011 after 1.74 percent in 2010 and 2.4
percent in 2008.  Bulgaria joined NATO in 2004 and has since worked to
replace Soviet-era military hardware with NATO compliant
equipment.  The Balkan nation has spent 522 million euros ($764
million) under contracts signed from 2003 to 2006 for C-27J
military transport planes built by  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s Alenia
Aeronautica SpA, Cougar AS-352 and Panther AS-323 helicopters
from Eurocopter SA and DaimlerChrysler AG off-road army
vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
