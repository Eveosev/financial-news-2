Siemens AG (SIE)  won an order from German
national rail company  Deutsche Bahn  AG for as many as 300
trains, marking the largest contract to date in the German
engineering company’s history.  Deutsche Bahn will buy the ICx-dubbed trains for delivery
until 2030, with an initial lot of 130 units, the rail company
said in a statement today. Additional orders for 90 and 80
trains may follow later. The first two tranches of the order,
comprising 220 trains, is worth about 6 billion euros ($8.7
billion), two people familiar with the negotiations said.  “The new ICx will be the backbone of our long-distance
network,” Deutsche Bahn Chief Executive Officer Ruediger Grube
said in the statement.  Spokespeople for Siemens and Deutsche Bahn said they cannot
comment on the size of the order before it has been completed.  Siemens had been preferred bidder for the contract since
January 25, 2010. Its mobility business competes with those of
 Alstom SA (ALO)  of  France  and  Canada ’s Bombardier Inc. The first
trains are scheduled start operation from 2016. The deal with
Deutsche Bahn follows a contract in October from Eurostar Group
Ltd., the operator of high-speed trains in the Channel Tunnel.  The largest order for Siemens prior to today was for a
contract in 2006 to provide computers and telephones to
 Germany ’s army. Siemens’s share of the deal was set at about 60
percent of the order’s total, worth of 7.1 billion euros,  To contact the reporter on this story:
