Gerard Houllier , manager of Premier
League soccer club Aston Villa, is being treated in hospital
after becoming ill last night, Sky News reported.  Houllier, 63, is in a comfortable condition, Sky said,
without saying where it got the information. It’s not known if
his illness is related to heart problems he had while manager of
Liverpool in 2001, the broadcaster added.  Houllier has come under criticism from some Villa fans as
the team’s form stuttered this season. It’s currently 10th in
the league.  Assistant manager Gary McAllister is likely to take charge
of the team for the Premier League game at home to Stoke in two
days, Sky said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
