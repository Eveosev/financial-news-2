The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will reduce exports by 1.4 percent in the
four weeks to May 7 in line with a seasonal lull in consumption,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, responsible for 40 percent of global supplies, will
ship 22.67 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 7,
down from 23 million a day in the period to April 9, the
consultant said today in a report. The decline is driven by
Middle East members of the group, it said. The data exclude
 Ecuador  and Angola.  “We’re seeing the low point of the second quarter, of the
spring refinery maintenance season and its effect on demand,”
Oil Movements founder Roy Mason said in an interview from
Halifax,  England . “Nothing much is going to happen until the
end of next month, when we’re starting to look at summer and
demand for long-haul cargoes will rise.”  Saudi Arabia’s Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said April 17 that
the global “market is oversupplied” and that the kingdom cut
supply by more than 800,000 barrels a day.  Brent crude  for June
settlement traded at about $124 a barrel in  London  today, having
reached a 2 1/2-year high of $127.02 a barrel on April 11.  Shipments from Middle Eastern producers, including those
from non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen, will decrease to 17.42
million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 7, according to
the report. That’s down from 17.76 million barrels in the
previous period.  An average of 473.36 million barrels of crude will be on
board tankers in the month to May 7, down 0.9 percent from
477.75 million in the four weeks to April 9, Oil Movements said.  Oil Movements calculates shipments by keeping a tally of
tanker-rental agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on
board ships used as floating storage.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,  Iran , Iraq,
Kuwait,  Libya , Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system.
The organization is next due to meet on June 8 in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
