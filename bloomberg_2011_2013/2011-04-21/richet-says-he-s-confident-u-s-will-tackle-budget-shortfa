European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said he’s confident the U.S. government will
tackle its  budget deficit  after  Standard & Poor’s  said the
country risks losing its AAA credit rating.  “I have confidence the U.S. will address its budget
situation,” Trichet said today on BFM radio in Paris. “It
seems to me that that’s how we can interpret most recent
statements of the American executive.”  S&P said this week there’s a one-in-three chance the rating
may be cut within two years if U.S. politicians fail to agree on
a “meaningful” fiscal plan. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said he expects Congress and President Barack Obama
will be able to narrow their differences and move toward a long-
term plan to reduce record budget deficits and debt.  All advanced economies have “serious” fiscal problems,
Trichet said. “It’s urgent to return order to public
finances,” he added. “We have to restore the authority of the
authorities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
