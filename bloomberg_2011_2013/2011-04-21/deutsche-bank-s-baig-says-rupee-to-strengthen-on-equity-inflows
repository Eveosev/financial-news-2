Mirza Baig, a Singapore-based
currency strategist at Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest bank,
comments on the outlook for India’s rupee.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
gained 0.2 percent to 45.03 per dollar as of 9:19 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will weaken 1.6 percent from the spot rate of
44.3075.  “In an environment of high risk appetite, the rupee can
extend its gains against the dollar to beyond the 44 level. I am
positive on the rupee. There is strong inflow momentum coming
into the equity market.  “People tend to exaggerate how vulnerable the rupee is to
 oil prices . Even though oil prices are going up, the import
volumes from  India  have not increased. The domestic production
has been offsetting the increase in demand for oil from India.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
