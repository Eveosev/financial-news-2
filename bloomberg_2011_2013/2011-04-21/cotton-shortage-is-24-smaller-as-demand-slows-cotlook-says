The cotton shortage this season
will be 24 percent smaller than forecast last month because of
slowing demand, led by  China , the world’s largest buyer and
producer of the textile material, Cotlook Ltd. said.  Production will lag behind demand by 414,000 metric tons in
the season that ends July 31, down from last month’s estimate of
548,000 tons, Birkenhead, England-based Cotlook said in a report
today. China’s demand forecast was lowered by 188,000 tons to
9.8 million tons, the company said.  “Statistics confirm recent anecdotal reports of slowing
mill consumption of raw cotton on various markets,” Cotlook
said in the report.  Cotton prices in  New York  have almost doubled in the past
year because of the global shortage.  Cotton output will exceed demand by 1.25 million tons in
the season starting Aug. 1, 11 percent more than last month’s
estimate, Cotlook said. Production will be almost 27.6 million
tons, 59,000 tons higher than the March forecast and up 14
percent from this season, according to the report.  “A significant recovery in world supply remains in
prospect during 2011-12,” Cotlook said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
