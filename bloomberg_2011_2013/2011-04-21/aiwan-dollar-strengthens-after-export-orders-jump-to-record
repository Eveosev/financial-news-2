Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to its
strongest level in more than two months after the island’s
export orders rose to a record in March.  The currency gained for a second day after official data
showed yesterday orders for shipments climbed 13.4 percent from
a year earlier to $38.9 billion, compared with the median growth
forecast of 4.7 percent by analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “The surprisingly good export figures lifted sentiment,”
said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union
Bank of Taiwan. “More income from overseas will support the
currency.”  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to NT$28.926 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.866 earlier, the strongest
level since February 10.  Government bonds  were little changed for a fifth day. The
yield on the 1 percent note due January 2016, the most-active
government security, was 1.074 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
