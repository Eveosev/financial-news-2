The number of visitors to  Greece 
increased 0.6 percent in 2010 as a surge in arrivals from
 Russia , Serbia and Poland offset a decline in visitors from
western  Europe .  Visitors from Russia surged almost 64 percent to 451,239
buoyed by an economy that grew 4 percent in 2010. Arrivals from
Serbia and Montenegro rose 42 percent to 706,635 while Polish
tourist numbers almost doubled to 402,170. Cypriot travelers
rose 32 percent to 574,674.  A total of 15 million visitors arrived in Greece in 2010,
compared with 14.9 million a year earlier, the  Hellenic
Statistical Authority  said in an e-mailed  statement  today.  The tourist season was affected by strikes, that shuttered
transport services, as the government was forced to implement
austerity measures as part of conditions attached to a bailout
from the European Union and  International Monetary Fund . Tourism
contributes 16 percent to Greek gross domestic product and
accounts for one in five jobs, according to the  World Travel and
Tourism Council , an industry group.  German visitor numbers dropped almost 14 percent to 2.04
million. Visitors from the U.K. declined almost 15 percent to
1.8 million and non-resident visits from France fell 10 percent
to 868,346.  The figures are based on a sample taken at border entry
points by the Bank of Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
