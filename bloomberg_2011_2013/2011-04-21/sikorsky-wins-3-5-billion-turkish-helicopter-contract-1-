Sikorsky Aircraft Corp., a
subsidiary of  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , won a $3.5 billion
contract to provide 109 general-purpose helicopters to the
Turkish government.  The government opted to start contract negotiations with
Sikorsky at a meeting in Ankara today, state news agency
Anatolia reported.  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  unit AgustaWestland had also
been bidding for the work.  Turkish defense contractor Tusas Aerospace Industries will
manufacture “a large proportion” of the fuselage, motor,
avionics and software for the T-70 Blackhawk helicopters,
Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul said after the meeting.  Initially 109 helicopters will be built, possibly rising to
600, Gonul said. They may be sold to third countries, Anatolia
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
