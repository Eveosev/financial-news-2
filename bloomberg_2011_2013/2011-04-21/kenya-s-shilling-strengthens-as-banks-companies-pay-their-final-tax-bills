Kenya’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar as banks and companies sought the local
currency to pay their final 2010 tax bills, according to CFC
Stanbic Bank Ltd.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 83.75 shillings per dollar and was
trading at 83.85 shillings at 3:08 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital,
from yesterday’s close of 84 shillings.  “The final tax instalment for 2010 for all banks and big
corporates is due today,” Bethuel Karanja, heading of trading
at CFC Stanbic Bank, Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s Kenyan unit,
said in a phone interview today. “That has mopped up liquidity
from the market into government coffers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
