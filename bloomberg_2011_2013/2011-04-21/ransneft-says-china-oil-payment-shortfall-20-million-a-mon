OAO Transneft,  Russia ’s oil
pipeline operator, said a shortfall in payments from  China  for
crude supplies has totaled about $20 million a month since
January.  Transneft will seek back payments in negotiations scheduled
to take place this May in Beijing, Mikhail Barkov, a vice
president at the Moscow-based company, said in a  statement  today
on its website.  Russia made its first oil deliveries by pipeline to China,
the world’s fastest growing market, on Jan. 1 under a loans-for-
oil deal. OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, and
Transneft agreed to deliver 15 million tons of oil a year via
the East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline for 20 years to China,
which agreed to provide $25 billion in loans.  Transneft has in effect borrowed from Rosneft the amount it
is seeking from China, Barkov said. State-controlled Rosneft
sells Transneft the oil that the operator supplies to China.  Transneft won’t double supplies to China given the current
situation, Barkov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
