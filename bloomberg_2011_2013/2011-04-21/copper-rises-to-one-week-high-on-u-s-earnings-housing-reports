Copper rose to a one-week high as
housing and corporate-earnings data bolstered prospects for the
economy in the U.S., the world’s second-largest consumer of the
metal.  Equities advanced after companies including Apple Inc.,
General Electric Co. and Morgan Stanley reported better-than-
estimated profits. Sales of previously owned homes in March
exceeded economists’ forecast. The index of U.S. leading
indicators increased for a ninth month. Copper also gained as
the dollar fell, and Anglo American Plc said output dropped.  “All the data point to a drastic improvement in the
economy,” said  Matthew Zeman , a senior strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago . “ A sharply lower dollar is adding to
things. The path looks higher for metals.”  Copper futures for July delivery gained 6 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close at $4.419 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex in
 New York . Earlier, the price reached $4.422, the highest for a
most-active contract since April 13.  The metal has jumped 24 percent in the past year, reaching
a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15, as output from mining companies
failed to keep pace with rising consumption.  China  is the
leading consumer of industrial metals.  Anglo American’s copper output dropped 14 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier because of heavy rainfall in
 South America .  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed $125, or 1.3 percent, to $9,705 a metric ton
($4.40 a pound).  Aluminum rose $15, or 0.5 percent, to $2,745 a ton.
Earlier, the price reached $2,757, the highest since Aug. 28,
2008. Tin, nickel and zinc also climbed. Lead fell.  The LME will be closed tomorrow and April 25 for Good
Friday and Easter Monday. The Comex will be closed tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
