Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s
largest software maker, will provide financial “support” to
four cloud-computing startups in  India , Chief Operating Officer
Kevin Turner said.  The support will be in the form of “grants” and will
amount to about $100,000 in total, Turner said in Mumbai today,
without elaborating.  Microsoft and Adobe Systems Inc. are among companies that
will gain from a U.S. government shift of as much as $20 billion
in e-mail, website management and claims processing systems to
so-called cloud computing. Microsoft is betting businesses will
increase spending on computing services and applications
accessed through the Internet instead of through individual
servers and plans to spend 90 percent of its $9.6 billion
research and development budget on cloud strategy this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
