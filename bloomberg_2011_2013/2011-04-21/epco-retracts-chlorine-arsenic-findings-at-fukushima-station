Tokyo Electric  Power Co. retracted
readings for radioactive elements that the utility earlier said
it found in water in the basements of buildings at its crippled
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, after reviewing the data.  Chlorine-38 and arsenic-74 weren’t detected at the basement
of the turbine building of the No. 1 reactor after the company
said it found the radioactive materials on March 25, according
to a  statement  on Tokyo Electric’s website.  The reported discovery of the chlorine in the turbine
building of reactor No. 1 suggested chain reactions in the core
continued after the reactor shut down, physicist Ferenc Dalnoki-
Veress of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies
in Monterey,  California , wrote in a March 28 paper. Radioactive
chlorine has a half-life of 37 minutes, Dalnoki-Veress said.  Tokyo Electric also lowered the readings for the density of
other radioactive elements, including cesium-137, technetium-99m
and lanthanum-140, found in the water that accumulated in the
buildings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
