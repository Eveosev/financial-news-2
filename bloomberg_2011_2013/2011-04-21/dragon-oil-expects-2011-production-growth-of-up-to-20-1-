Dragon Oil Plc (DGO) , the energy explorer
focusing on projects in  Turkmenistan , expects production growth
of as much as 20 percent this year as it adds wells.  Three new wells have been put into production this year,
the Dubai-based company said in a Regulatory News Service
statement today. The average daily production rate was about
57,800 barrels of oil per day in the three months ended March
31, up from 47,600 barrels a year earlier.  The company upgraded its reserves to 639 million barrels of
oil and condensate at the year-end and 1.6 trillion cubic feet
of gas reserves. Dragon maintained its medium-term production
target of 10 percent to 15 percent growth on average per annum
between 2011 and 2013.  “Dragon Oil had a strong first quarter with a very solid
production performance,” Chief Executive Officer Abdul Jaleel Al Khalifa said in today’s statement. ”A number of significant
projects are being progressed this year to support our continued
development.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
