U.S. administration officials
failed to persuade  Standard & Poor’s  not to lower its outlook on
the U.S. credit rating to “negative” from “stable,” the
Washington Post reported, citing two unidentified people
familiar with the matter.  Treasury Department officials discussed a possible change
in the rating company’s outlook for the U.S. for several weeks
before S&P issued its statement April 18, the newspaper said.  The officials argued that S&P underestimated chances for a
political compromise to curtail the  budget deficit , that the
administration had a viable plan, and no change was necessary
because the debt was manageable, the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified Treasury official.  S&P rejected Treasury arguments and expressed skepticism in
its report over possibilities for a budget compromise, the
newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
