UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
said it’s conducting an “internal review” of a few employees’
conduct and denied a report that police and federal agents had
escorted workers from its office in Stamford, Connecticut.  “Reports of law enforcement on UBS’s premises this week
are incorrect,”  Kelly Smith , a spokeswoman for UBS in New York,
said in an e-mailed statement. “UBS is conducting an internal
review into the conduct of a few employees, and we do not
comment on internal reviews.”  Earlier today  Dealbreaker.com  reported that four UBS
employees were escorted out of the Stamford office by police and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The employees were in the
operations department, where they were responsible for payments
and securities movements. UBS’s response was later included in
an  update  of the report, which said it is “unclear” what had
happened at the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
