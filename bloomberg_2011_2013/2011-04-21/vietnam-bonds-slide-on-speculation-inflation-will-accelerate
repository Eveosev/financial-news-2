Vietnam ’s five-year bonds dropped
for a sixth straight day, the longest losing streak in almost
three years, on speculation inflation will accelerate. The dong
was steady.  The nation’s consumer price index rose 13.9 percent in
March from a year earlier, after increasing 12.3 percent the
previous month, according to official data. The General
Statistics Office is due to release the data for April next
week.  “Bonds yields are still on an upward trend,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at ACB Securities Inc. in  Ho Chi Minh
City . He predicted the price gauge may climb 15 percent this
year, higher than the government’s target of a maximum of 7
percent.  The yield on the bond rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 12.39 percent, according to a daily fixing
price from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,925 per dollar as of 2:19 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,918 yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed the currency’s reference
rate at 20,723, compared with 20,728 yesterday, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
