The Australian dollar climbed to a
record after a government report showed producer prices rose
more than economists estimated in the first quarter, providing
additional evidence growth is accelerating.  The Aussie strengthened for a third day versus its U.S.
counterpart, and  New Zealand ’s dollar advanced for a second day,
as stock gains boosted demand for the nations’ higher-yielding
assets. New Zealand’s dollar, called the kiwi, reached a three-
year high versus the greenback as traders added to bets the
central bank will raise  interest rates  over the next 12 months.  “The macro-economic backdrop is great and getting
better,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP
 Australia  Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest interdealer
broker. “There are plenty of reasons to love the Aussie at the
moment, not the least of which is our favorable yield
advantage.”  Australia’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0744 at
12:28 p.m. in  New York , from $1.0714 yesterday. It earlier
reached $1.0775, the strongest level since it was freely floated
in 1983. The Aussie declined 0.7 percent to 87.86 yen, from
88.45 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to 80.17 U.S. cents
after earlier gaining to 80.38 cents, the highest level since
March 2008. It fell 0.5 percent to 65.55 yen, from 65.87 yen.  Weekly Gains  The Aussie gained 1.7 percent against the  U.S. dollar  this
week, while the kiwi appreciated 0.3 percent.  Benchmark interest rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and
2.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets.  The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index gained 0.7 percent today, after rising
2 percent yesterday.  Producer prices in Australia rose 1.2 percent in the first
quarter from the prior three months, when they climbed 0.1
percent, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 1 percent increase.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand will raise its benchmark
rate by 63 basis points in the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse
Group AG index based on swaps showed today. That compares with a
prediction yesterday of 49 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
