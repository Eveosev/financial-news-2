The Egyptian public prosecutor’s
office ordered a medical examination for former President  Hosni Mubarak  to determine whether he can be moved to a Cairo prison
or prison hospital.  The office said in a statement it ordered an inspection of
the hospital at Cairo’s Torah Prison to ascertain if it’s
medically equipped to receive Mubarak. Separately, Deputy
Justice Minister Assem el-Gohary told reporters today that
officials with the Illicit Gains Authority will question
Mubarak’s daughters-in-law next week about the wealth of their
husbands, Gamal and Alaa.  The public prosecutor on April 13 ordered Mubarak’s
detention for 15 days as part of a corruption probe. The former
president, 82, is hospitalized in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El
Sheikh and his health is “unstable,” the state-run Middle East
News Agency reported today, citing a medical official.  Mubarak and his two sons, who have been detained for the
same period, were questioned about the alleged embezzlement of
public funds and attacks on protesters during an uprising that
led to the former president’s resignation, the prosecutor said
on April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
