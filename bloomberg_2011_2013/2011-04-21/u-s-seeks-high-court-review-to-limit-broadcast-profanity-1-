President Barack Obama’s
administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to consider
reinstating Federal Communications Commission restrictions on
broadcast profanities and nudity.  Acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal today urged the
justices to review a lower court’s conclusion that the FCC’s
indecency policy was so vague it violated the Constitution’s
free- speech guarantee.  In two decisions, a federal appeals court in New York said
the FCC couldn’t fine broadcasters for expletives used on award
shows on  News Corp. (NWS) ’s Fox network and for a scene involving a
naked woman on “NYPD Blue,” shown on  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC
network.  Katyal said the appeals court rulings “preclude the
commission from effectively implementing statutory restrictions
on broadcast indecency that the agency has enforced since its
creation in 1934.”  The government appeal centers on First Amendment issues
that the high court opted not to resolve when it temporarily
revived the FCC’s anti-expletive policy in 2009. Justices in
both the majority and dissent in that case pointed to free-
speech concerns about the crackdown.  The appeals court said in the Fox case that the FCC’s
policy caused “a chilling effect that goes far beyond the
fleeting expletives at issue here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
