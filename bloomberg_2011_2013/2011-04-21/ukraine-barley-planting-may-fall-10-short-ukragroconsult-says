Ukraineâ€™s farmers may plant 10
percent less barley than planned because cold weather and rain
delayed seeding and the most favorable conditions may have been
missed, UkrAgroConsult said.  Barley planting may reach 2.8 million to 3 million hectares
(7.4 million acres), compared with the 3.1 million hectares
originally planned, the Kiev-based consulting company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Planting reached 2.26 million hectares, 73 percent of the
planned area, as of April 19, compared with 2.98 million
hectares planted by that date last year, the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
