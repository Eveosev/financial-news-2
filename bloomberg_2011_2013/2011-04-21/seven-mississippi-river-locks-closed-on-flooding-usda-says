Seven  Mississippi River  locks in
Iowa and Illinois are closed because of flooding, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said.  The river has “overtopped lock gates” from Dubuque, Iowa,
to New Boston, Illinois, making the locks inoperable, the USDA’s
Agricultural Marketing Service said today in a  report  on its
website. Additional closures may occur in the next several weeks
as water rises, the agency said.  “Since the river levels will fluctuate because of spring
rains, it is too soon to forecast the closure of the remaining
locks or the duration of closures for this flood event,” the
USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
