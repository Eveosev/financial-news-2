Oil climbed for a third day in  New
York  as better-than-estimated earnings boosted confidence in the
strength of the economic rebound, signaling that fuel demand
will increase.  Futures rose 0.8 percent and stocks extended this year’s
biggest global rally after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said yesterday second-
quarter profit almost doubled. The dollar dropped to a 16-month
low against the euro, bolstering demand for raw materials. Oil
also gained after a report yesterday showed that U.S. crude-oil
supplies fell for the first time since February.  “We have bullish information going into a long weekend,”
said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics, an energy
advisory firm in Austin,  Texas . “The dollar continues to
weaken, yesterday’s report was bullish for oil across the board
and the overall economic outlook is improving.”  Crude oil for June delivery rose 84 cents to $112.29 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since April 8. Prices are up 34 percent in the past
year. The June contract climbed 1.9 percent this week.  Brent crude oil for June settlement increased 14 cents to
end the session at $123.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  Trading on both the Nymex and ICE will be closed tomorrow
for the Easter holiday. Aggregate trading volume was 383,655
contracts at 3:30 p.m. compared with the one-year daily average
of 713,000.  ‘Magnified’ Moves  “Any move in the market today may be magnified because
there is no volume behind it,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with
BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New York. “A lot of
people are off because of the holiday weekend.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 26.91 points to
12,480.45, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.5
percent to 1,335.40 at 3:27 p.m.  The dollar fell 0.2 percent to $1.4548 against the euro,
after slipping to $1.4649, the weakest level since December
2009. A drop in the dollar makes commodities priced in the
currency more attractive for investors.  “What happens in the oil market now depends on the
dollar,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group
Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania . “The correlation between the
dollar and oil broke down late last year, but has reignited this
month.”  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
climbed 0.5 percent to 367.44. Gold for June delivery increased
$4.90, or 0.3 percent, to settle at a record $1,503.80 an ounce
on the Comex in New York. The precious metal reached $1,509.60,
a record intraday high.  Demand Pickup  “Oil’s gaining today from a combination of the strong euro
and continuing good news from the stock markets,” said  Robert Montefusco , senior broker at Sucden Financial in  London .
“Yesterday’s Energy Department numbers helped a lot, and we
should get a pickup in demand over the next month as the
holidays approach.”  U.S. crude oil supplies fell 2.32 million barrels to 357
million last week, the first drop since February, the Energy
Department said yesterday in a weekly report. Inventories were
forecast to increase by 1.3 million barrels, according to the
median of 13 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline stockpiles dropped 1.58 million barrels to 208.1
million, the lowest level since the week ended Nov. 12, the
report showed. Stockpiles were forecast to decline by 1.75
million barrels, according to the survey.  Middle East Unrest  Oil has advanced 23 percent in New York this year. Unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa has toppled leaders in Egypt
and  Tunisia  and spread to  Libya , Algeria, Bahrain,  Iran , Oman,
Syria and Yemen.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its allies are
being drawn more deeply into an intervention that aims to topple
Libya’s Muammar Qaddafi. The U.S. announced yesterday it will
provide $25 million in aid to Libya’s disorganized and poorly
equipped rebels, while  Italy ,  France  and the U.K. dispatched
military advisers.  Libyan crude output, which averaged 1.6 million barrels a
day last year, fell to 390,000 barrels a day in March, according
to a Bloomberg News survey. The country has Africa’s biggest
proved oil reserves.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut
crude-oil loadings because of a seasonal drop in consumption,
according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements. The group will ship
22.67 million barrels a day in the four weeks to May 7, down
from 23 million barrels in the period ended April 9, the
Halifax, England-based consultant said in a report yesterday.  Oil volume in New York totaled 520,703 contracts yesterday,
34 percent below the average of the past three months. Open
interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
