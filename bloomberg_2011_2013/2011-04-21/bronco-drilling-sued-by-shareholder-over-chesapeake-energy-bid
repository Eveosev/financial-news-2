Bronco Drilling Co. was sued in
Delaware Chancery Court by a stockholder seeking more than the
$11 a share being offered for the company by  Chesapeake Energy
Corp. (CHK)  The deal is currently valued at about $316 million.  Directors of Bronco, based in Edmond,  Oklahoma , have a duty
to get the best price for the company and have undervalued the
stock, investor Sam Berlinberg said in a complaint filed
yesterday in Wilmington.  “The proposed transaction offers Bronco shareholders a
mere 6 percent premium,” and “analysts have set a target price
for Bronco shares as high as $13.50,” the plaintiff’s lawyers
said in court papers.  Bronco, which reported a $50.6 million net loss last year
on $124.4 million in revenue, is 22 percent owned by Third
Avenue Management LLC and 15 percent controlled by billionaire
 Carlos Slim .  “It is our policy to not comment on pending litigation,”
Bob Jarvis, a Bronco spokesman, said in an e-mailed message.  Bronco fell 4 cents to $11.02 at 1:09 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The case is Sam Berlinberg v. Bronco Drilling Co., CA6398,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
