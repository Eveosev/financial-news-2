Option traders boosted bearish bets
on  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  after earnings of the world’s
second-biggest software maker by market value failed to beat
analysts’ estimates.  Open interest, or the number of contracts held by traders,
in put options was 6,140, or more than three times the 20-day
average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The company’s shares,
set for a record close before results were announced, dropped
2.2 percent to 1,192.1 rupees in Mumbai.  Net income climbed 23 percent to 24 billion rupees ($542
million) in the quarter ended March 31, the company said in
earnings based on U.S. accounting rules. That compares with the
23.6 billion-rupee average of 31 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Markets had built in higher expectations,” said Ashish
Chaturmohta, a derivatives analyst at Mumbai-based IIFL Private
Wealth Management Ltd., which advises clients on investment
strategies for assets worth $1.8 billion. “The numbers barely
met estimates. Traders took money off the table.”  Traders pared positions in put options at 1,200 rupees
strikes and boosted bets at 1,150 rupees, a contract with the
highest open interest of 2,021, data show.  “The floor has shifted from 1,200 rupees to 1,150 rupees
after the earnings,” Chaturmohta said.  A  call option  gives the right to buy a security at a set
price by a specific date. A put option conveys the right to
sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in the
price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves or
bet that volatility will rise or fall.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the reporter on this story:
