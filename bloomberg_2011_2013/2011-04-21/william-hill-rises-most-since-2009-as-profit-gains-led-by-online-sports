William Hill Plc (WMH)  gained the most
since October 2009 after the U.K. bookmaker said first-quarter
operating profit rose 21 percent, led by online sports betting.  Net revenue increased 11 percent, as in-shop gambling
machines thrived, the London-based company said in a statement.
The company said it was “confident” about its full-year
forecasts. The shares advanced 7.5 percent.  This month William Hill agreed to buy two Nevada land-based
sports-betting service companies to enter the U.S. market for
the first time. William Hill’s first quarter topped its rival,
Ladbrokes Plc, where net revenue gained 2.3 percent.  “I’ve seen all the misery coming out of the retail
sector,” Chief Executive Officer Ralph Topping said in a
conference call with analysts. “Maybe we’re at the stage where
the betting man says, ‘yes, there’s gloom and doom out there,
but you know what? I’m going to have my fun.’”  William Hill increased 14.8 pence to 213.3 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London . The shares have gained 25 percent so
far this year, giving the company a market value of 1.5 billion
pounds ($2.5 billion).  William Hill said its performance was “good,” even though
comparisons were easier because March last year had two weeks
affected by weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
