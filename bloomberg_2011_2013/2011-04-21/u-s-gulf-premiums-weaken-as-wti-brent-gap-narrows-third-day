U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
against West  Texas  Intermediate as Brent oil’s spread versus the
U.S. benchmark shrank the third consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery decreased 76 cents to $11.64 a barrel at 12:32 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI narrowed $1 to $14 a
barrel at 11:52 a.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened 90 cents to
$14.75 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend weakened $1.50 to $7 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s premium
decreased $1.75 to $7.25 a barrel. Southern Green Canyon’s
premium lost $1.25 to $6.25 a barrel.  Thunder Horse’s premium lost 25 cents to $10.25 a barrel.  West Texas Sour’s discount weakened 5 cents to $3.10 a
barrel. The grade has tracked more closely to its historical
average discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland,
Texas, away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12.35 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$15.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
