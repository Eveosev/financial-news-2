Indian stocks advanced for a third
day, led by lenders and metal companies, amid expectation their
earnings growth will be robust.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the biggest lender, paced gains among
its peers after it raised  interest rates  on mortgages. Hindustan
Zinc Ltd., the largest producer of the metal, surged to a record
after reporting its highest-ever quarterly profit.  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s most valuable company, reached a
two-week high before its results later today.  “We expect earnings of banks, commodities and consumers
companies to outpace the market earnings growth,” said Neelesh Surana, head of equities at a local unit of Mirae Asset
Financial Group, which has about $2.5 billion invested in India.
“We are looking at businesses that can withstand the current
headwinds related to high  oil prices  and elevated interest
rates.” He declined to comment on specific shares.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 131.25, or 0.7 percent, to 19,602.23 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The gauge climbed 1.1 percent this week. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange climbed 0.6
percent to 5,884.70 and its April futures settled at 5,901.6.
The BSE 200 Index added 0.4 percent to 2,415.54. The markets are
closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  The rally in India mirrored gains in Asian equities. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed to its highest since March 4
after U.S. companies including  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  reported increased
profits, signaling the global economic recovery is accelerating,
and commodity shares gained.  Home Loans  State Bank  climbed 2.4 percent to 2,861.15 rupees, its
highest close since Dec. 7. The lender ended its special home
loan plan and linked its mortgage to base rates, Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said yesterday, citing concern from the regulator over
the plan that offered loans at below market costs in the first
two to three years.  The “competitive pressure” in mortgages will ease after
the move, Kotak Institutional Equities analysts led by Manish Karwa said in a report today.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage
lender, rose 2.4 percent to 732.2 rupees and its April futures
settled at 733.95 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the third-biggest
lender, rallied 1.6 percent to 2,410.65 rupees, its highest
level since Oct. 14.  Expansion in India’s $1.3 trillion economy has increased
consumer demand and spurred manufacturing, car sales and credit
growth, stoking price risks and prompting the central bank to
increase rates eight times since March 2010.  Banks to Benefit  “Higher interest rates driven by higher demand is
beneficial for banks,” said Arun Khurana, a  fund manager  at UTI
Asset Management Co. Pvt., India’s fourth-biggest mutual fund
with $15.2 billion in assets. The UTI Banking Sector Fund that
Khurana manages has returned 28 percent in the past year,
compared with 12 percent gain in the Sensex.  The Sensex has fallen 4.4 percent this year on concern that
rising borrowing costs will crimp profit growth. Companies on
the index trade at an average 16.6 times estimated earnings,
compared with 21.5 times in March 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index is valued at 11.7 times.  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , the largest producer, surged 3.2
percent to 151.9 rupees, its highest-ever close. Net income
climbed to 17.7 billion rupees ($400 million), or 4.2 rupees a
share, in the quarter ended March 31 from 12.4 billion rupees,
or 2.93 rupees, a year earlier, the unit of U.K.-based  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  said today. The average of 19 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 13.7 billion rupees.  Metal Stocks  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the No. 1 copper and zinc
producer also controlled by Vedanta, rose 2.3 percent to 178.8
rupees.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the largest aluminum producer,
increased 3 percent to 220.8 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the
biggest producer of the alloy, climbed 0.9 percent to 630.05
rupees.  Reliance rose 1.4 percent to 1,040.6 rupees. Profit may
increase 15 percent to 54.3 billion rupees, according to the
mean estimate among 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the world’s second-largest
computer services provider by market value, said profit rose 23
percent to 24 billion rupees in the quarter ended March. That
compares with the 23.6 billion-rupee average of 31 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares fell 2.2 percent to
1,192.1 rupees, reversing a matching gain.  “The earnings are marginally ahead of our estimates, but
not blockbuster,” said Subhashini Gurumurthy, an analyst with
Ambit Capital Pvt.  Overseas funds bought a net 20.6 billion rupees ($462
million) of Indian stocks on April 19, taking their investments
in equities this year to 57.9 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India .  India’s economic expansion and corporate earnings lured
foreign funds to buy a record $29.4 billion of local equities
last year and made the Sensex the best performer and most
expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
