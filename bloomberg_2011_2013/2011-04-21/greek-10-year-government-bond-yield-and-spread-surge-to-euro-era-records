Greek government bonds fell,
pushing the yield on the 10-year security 16 basis points higher
to a euro-era record of 14.92 percent as of 7:40 a.m. in  London .  Two-year yields rose 38 basis points to 22.40 percent, also
a record.                        The yield difference, or spread, between Greek 10-year
bonds and German securities of a similar maturity widened to
1,159 basis points, the most since Bloomberg began collecting
the data in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
