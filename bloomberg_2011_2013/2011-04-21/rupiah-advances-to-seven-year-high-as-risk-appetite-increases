Indonesia’s rupiah touched a seven-
year high as evidence the global economic recovery is intact
boosted demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency strengthened for a second day and posted a 0.7
percent weekly gain after U.S. companies, including  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ,
posted better results than analysts had expected. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of regional stocks rose 1.1 percent. Overseas
funds bought $44.5 million more Indonesian shares than they sold
yesterday, exchange data show.  “The market is in a risk-on mode with equity markets
closing in positive territory overnight,” said  Prakriti Sofat ,
a Singapore-based economist at Barclays Plc. “Apple’s earnings
surprised on the upside setting a positive tone for Asian
bourses and supporting inflows.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,625 per dollar as
of 4:33 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 8,621 earlier, the highest level since April 27, 2004.
The currency has advanced 4.1 percent this year. Financial
markets in  Indonesia  are closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  Apple reported an almost doubling of second-quarter net
income yesterday, boosted by rising demand for its iPhone.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds fell for the week. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed 17 basis
points to 7.77 from April 14, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association. The bonds were little
changed today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
