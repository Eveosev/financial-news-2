Former  UBS AG (UBSN)  client Ernest
Vogliano was sentenced to two years probation for filing false
income taxes and conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service by hiding $4.9 million at the bank in  Switzerland .  Vogliano, 80, was one of seven U.S. taxpayers charged on
April 15, 2010, with filing false tax returns and related counts
for hiding Swiss bank accounts from the IRS. He was sentenced
today by U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Greisa in  New York , the
U.S. Attorney’s Office in  Manhattan  said in a statement.  Vogliano pleaded guilty in December to five counts of
filing false federal income tax returns and conspiracy to
defraud the IRS. Five of the seven defendants, including
Vogliano, have pleaded guilty.  UBS admitted in 2009 that it helped thousands of Americans
evade taxes, avoided U.S. prosecution by paying
$780 million and gave the  Internal Revenue Service  data on
accounts.  Vogliano paid a civil penalty of $940,381 as part of his
plea agreement, or an amount equal to 50 percent of the total
value of his unreported foreign accounts as of Dec. 31, 2004,
prosecutors said in the statement.  Kelly Smith, a spokeswoman for UBS in New York, didn’t
immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking comment
after regular business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Vogliano, 1:10-cr-00327, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
