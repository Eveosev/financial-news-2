China  gave 45.7 percent of its
total donor aid to countries in  Africa  in 2009 to help
construction of infrastructure projects and the development of
resources including oil and mines.  The nation has given out a total of 256.3 billion yuan
($39.3 billion) of cumulative foreign aid as of the end of 2009,
according to a document distributed by the State Council’s
Information Office. The report didn’t provide annual or country-
specific aid figures.  China has been trying to increase its foreign assistance,
partly as an effort to provide a wider range of investment
opportunities for domestic companies. The aid fund has been
growing at an average of 29.4 percent every year from 2004 to
2009, according to the report.  Chinese state-owned policy banks have lent money to foreign
countries and state-owned companies in amounts that far exceed
the figures given in the white paper released today. Since 2007,
 China Development Bank  has lent more than $68 billion to
Venezuela, Turkmenistan, Ecuador,  Brazil  and  Russia  in exchange
for oil and gas shipments.  The world’s fastest growing major economy has also forgiven
a total of 25.6 billion yuan in foreign country debts as of the
end of 2009. As much as 74 percent of the exemption was given to
nations in Africa, according to the report.  --Yidi Zhao, Michael Forsythe. Editors: Paul Tighe  To contact the reporters on this story:
