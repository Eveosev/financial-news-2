Gold rose to a record for the fifth
straight session, settling above $1,500 an ounce for the first
time, as a weaker dollar and debt concerns boosted demand for an
alternative investment. Silver rose above $46 an ounce.  Gold reached an all-time high $1,509.60 in  New York  as the
dollar slid to the lowest since August 2008 against a basket of
six major currencies. Greek two- and 10-year government-bond
yields reached euro-era records amid speculation the nation
won’t be able to avoid restructuring its debts.  “The key element determining gold’s near-term direction
right now is the  U.S. dollar ,”  Edel Tully , an analyst at UBS AG
in  London , said today in a report to clients. “Sovereign-debt
concerns in U.S. and Europe along with inflation fears provide a
good backdrop for gold.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $4.90, or 0.3 percent,
to settle at $1,503.80 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The most-active contract has posted a record 10 times this
month. The exchange will be closed tomorrow in observance of the
Good Friday holiday.  The metal for immediate delivery in London rose as much as
0.4 percent to a record $1,509 before retreating.  The U.S. Dollar Index dropped as much as 0.9 percent on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will be slow to raise
borrowing costs. Central banks in Europe and Asia have raised
 interest rates  to help combat accelerating consumer prices.  S&P Revision  The Fed has kept the benchmark rate between zero percent
and 0.25 percent since December 2008 and pledged to purchase
$600 billion in Treasuries through June to stimulate the
economy. Standard & Poor’s earlier this week revised its debt
outlook for the U.S. to negative from stable.  The U.S. Treasury Department projects the government could
reach its debt ceiling limit of $14.3 trillion as soon as mid-
May and run out of options for avoiding default by early July.  “Gold is and shall be the increasingly important
reservable currency,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the
editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.  Silver futures for May delivery rose $1.598, or 3.6
percent, to $46.059 on the Comex. In electronic trading, the
price touched $46.40, the highest price since January 1980, the
year futures reached a record $50.35.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $10.15, or 1.3
percent, to $769.05 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
