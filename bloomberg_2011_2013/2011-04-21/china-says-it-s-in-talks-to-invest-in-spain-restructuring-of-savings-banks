China  is in discussions to invest
in the restructuring of  Spain ’s savings banks, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hong Lei said, after a four-day visit by Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to  Asia .  “Premier  Wen Jiabao  told the Spanish prime minister, who
was attending the 2011 Boao Forum, that China will continue to
buy Spanish national debt and will participate in the
restructuring of Spain’s saving banks,” he told reporters in
Beijing today. “China is a responsible investor in the European
financial market.”  Spain is overhauling savings banks suffering from the
collapse of a decade-long property boom, encouraging them to
merge and forcing them to bolster capital levels as part of its
efforts to restore investor confidence in the economy and
financial system. Spanish savings banks need to raise as much as
14 billion euros ($20 billion) to reach new  capital requirements 
by September and lenders that can’t find private capital face at
least partial nationalization.  Hong’s remarks came after Spanish officials who declined to
be identified briefed reporters on April 13 that China
Investment Corp., a sovereign wealth fund, had told Zapatero in
Beijing that it planned to invest billions of euros in the
savings banks. CIC issued a denial, forcing the Spanish
officials to retract their comments.  China already holds 25 billion euros of Spanish sovereign
debt, up from 6 billion euros in 2009, Zapatero said on April 15
at the end of his Asian tour. That’s equivalent to 12.5 percent
of the Spanish debt in foreign hands, he told reporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
