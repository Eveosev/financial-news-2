U.S. nuclear-power output remained
near a 4½-year low for a fourth day as the Vogtle 1 reactor in
Georgia shut down unexpectedly, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide decreased 538 megawatts to
71,781 megawatts from yesterday, or 71 percent of capacity, the
smallest amount since Oct. 22, 2006, according to an NRC report
today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-nine of the
nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Southern Co. (SO) ’s 1,109-megawatt Vogtle 1 reactor
automatically tripped offline yesterday at 5:34 p.m. when it was
at full power. The cause is under investigation, the NRC said.  “No significant activities were in progress that should
have challenged the reactor protection system,” the federal
agency said.  The plant will remain in “hot” standby, meaning it is at
operating pressure and temperature, during the investigation,
the NRC said.  Another reactor at the site, the 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2,
is operating at full capacity. The plant is located 26 miles (42
kilometers) southeast of Augusta.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  started the 937-megawatt Brunswick 2
unit in  North Carolina  after shutting it April 19. It is
operating at 22 percent of capacity. The 938-megawatt Brunswick
1 is operating at full power at the Cape Fear site 130 miles
south of Raleigh.  Constellation Nuclear Energy Group LLC, a joint venture of
 Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG)  and Electricite de France SA,
boosted output at its 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point Unit 1 to
full power from 34 percent of capacity yesterday.  The reactor is about 6 miles northeast of Oswego,  New York ,
and was shut for refueling on March 21. Another unit at the
site, the 1,140-megawatt Unit 2, is operating at full power.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
