PTT Aromatics and Refining Pcl
shareholders approved a plan to merge with  PTT Chemical Pcl (PTTCH) , a
combination that would become  Thailand â€™s fourth-biggest company
by market value, PTT Aromatics Chairman Norkun Sitthiphong said.  The planned merger was approved Feb. 24 by the board of
both companies and parent  PTT Pcl. (PTT)  The new entity will have
registered capital of about 45 billion baht ($1.5 billion) and
its shares will start trading in August, PTT Aromatics President
Bowon Vongsinudom said today.  About $92 million will be spent to combine plants operated
by the two companies, which will create synergies valued at
between $80 million and $154 million, Bowon said.  PTT Aromatics expects its first-quarter profit to rise from
the same period last year because of higher product prices and
output, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
