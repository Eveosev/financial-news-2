Morgan Stanley (MS) , operator of the
world’s largest brokerage, agreed to buy back $323 million of
auction-rate securities from New Jersey customers to settle
state allegations that it misled investors.  The market for the securities collapsed during the
financial crisis of 2008 when banks stopped using their own cash
to support the market, leaving investors stuck with bonds they
couldn’t sell. The securities were marketed to investors as a
higher-yielding alternative to cash because, until the market
froze, they could be sold at periodic auctions run by banks.  Banks have agreed to buy back securities from individual
investors to settle state and federal regulatory inquiries into
whether they misled investors about risks associated with the
investments.  In 2008, Morgan Stanley agreed to repurchase $4.5 billion
of the securities under a  settlement  with state regulators. The
company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.  “This is nothing new,” Christy Pollak, a Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman, said today. “It’s simply  New Jersey ’s portion of
the settlement.”  Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for the New Jersey Attorney
General’s office, didn’t return a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
