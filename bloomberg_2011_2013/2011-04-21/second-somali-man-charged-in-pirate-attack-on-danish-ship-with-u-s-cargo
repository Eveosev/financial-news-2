A second man was charged in the
2008 pirate attack of a Danish-owned merchant ship carrying U.S.
cargo in the  Gulf of Aden  off the coast of Somalia.  Ali Mohamed Ali, 48, was arrested yesterday at Washington
Dulles International Airport in Dulles,  Virginia , on charges he
acted as a negotiator for the Somali pirates during the 71-day
takeover of the M/V CEC Future, according to a statement from
U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. in Washington.  “The pirates used AK-47s and a rocket-propelled grenade to
take over the ship,” according to the statement.  A lawyer for Ali couldn’t immediately be reached for
comment.  Jama Idle Ibrahim, 39, who like Ali is from Somalia, was
sentenced this month to 25 years in prison for his role in the
attack, according to Machen. He pleaded guilty. Ali was indicted
April 15 and is scheduled to appear in federal court in
 Washington  April 26. His case is the first in Washington to
charge someone with negotiating and receiving ransom in an act
of piracy, Machen said.  Ibrahim’s sentence is to run concurrently with a 30-year
sentence he’s already serving for the April 2010 attack on a
U.S. navy vessel in the Gulf of Aden, according to the
statement.  The case is U.S. v. Ali, 11-cr-106, U.S. District Court,
 District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
