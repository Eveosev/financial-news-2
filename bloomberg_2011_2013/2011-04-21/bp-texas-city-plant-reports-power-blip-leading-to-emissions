BP Plc (BP/)  said a “power blip” caused
multiple units to go into upset at its Texas City, Texas,
refinery, according to a filing with state regulators.  “Operations stabilized units,” the London-based company
said in a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality. Flaring began at 1 a.m. local time today and lasted
over eight hours, the filing said.  A phone call during normal working hours to  Scott Dean , a
Chicago-based company spokesman, was not returned.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The plant, located 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of
Houston, has a capacity of 475,000 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
