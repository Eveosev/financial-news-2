Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt.,
 Hungary â€™s second-largest mortgage lender, plans to boost lending
to small and medium-sized companies at a time when foreign-owned
competitors are scaling back such loans,  Napi Gazdasag  reported,
citing Chief Executive Officer Zoltan Speder.  Net interest income may rise this year after falling last
year, Speder said according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
