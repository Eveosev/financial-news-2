New applications for  unemployment
benefits  in the U.S. fell less than forecast last week,
indicating the labor market will take time to improve.  Jobless claims decreased by 13,000 to 403,000 in the week
ended April 16, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . Economists projected a decline to 390,000, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The number of
people on unemployment benefit rolls and those receiving
extended payments declined.  The level of claims is little changed from the end of 2010,
a sign of an uneven recovery in employment that’s making it
difficult for consumer spending, the biggest part of the
economy, to accelerate. The lack of faster job growth is one
reason Federal Reserve policy makers intend to complete their
asset-purchase plan and keep borrowing costs near zero.  “The labor market is improving gradually,” said  Joshua Shapiro , chief U.S. economist at MFR Inc. in  New York . “We have
headwinds due to rising gasoline prices but there will be enough
income generation to support moderate growth in  consumer
spending .”  Jobless benefits applications were projected to drop from
412,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to the
median forecast of 47 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 370,000 to 410,000.  Stock-Index Futures  Stock-index futures trimmed gains after the report. The
contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose 0.4 percent to 1,333.3 at 8:42 a.m. in New York. Treasuries
increased, pushing down the yield on the benchmark 10-year note
to 3.38 percent from 3.41 percent late yesterday.  Today’s report covers the week the Labor Department surveys
businesses to calculate the monthly payroll figures. The four-
week moving average, a less volatile measure than the weekly
figures, rose to 399,000 last week, the highest since the week
of Feb. 19, from 396,750.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
dropped by 7,000 in the week ended April 9 to 3.7 million, the
fewest since September 2008.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Extended Payments  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
70,000 to 4.24 million in the week ended April 2.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.9 percent,
today’s report showed.  Forty-nine states and territories reported an increase in
claims, while four reported a decrease. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  “Most districts reported that labor market conditions were
generally stronger than in their last reports,” the Fed said in
its Beige Book report released April 13. “Wage pressures were
reported to be mostly contained.”  The economy added 216,000 jobs in March, the most since May
2010, and unemployment fell to 8.8 percent, the lowest in more
than two years, Labor Department figures showed April 1.  Unemployment Forecast  The jobless rate will still be 8.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to the median forecast of economists in a
separate Bloomberg survey this month.  Some companies are turning more optimistic about hiring.
 Oak Brook , Illinois-based  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain by revenue, said it would seek as many as
50,000 workers in the U.S. during its National Hiring Day event
on April 19.  Others concerned about challenging macroeconomic conditions
include  Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest U.S. motorcycle maker.
The Milwaukee-based company’s U.S. dealer network is facing
“deep competitive discounting,” in part due to “persistently
high unemployment, falling home values and low  consumer
confidence ,” John Olin, chief financial officer, said in a
teleconference on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
