Rains in the southern Bahia and
Espirito Santo states are slowing robusta coffee pickings in
 Brazil , broker Flavour Coffee said yesterday.  Wet weather has delayed the start of the harvest in
Espirito Santo, the country’s main producing region of robusta
beans, forecaster Somar said on April 12.  Brazil is the world’s second-largest producer of robusta
beans, used in instant coffee, after  Vietnam .  “Weather is not helping farmers to accelerate picking
process,” Rio de Janeiro-based Flavour Coffee said in an e-
mailed report.  The majority of robusta coffee producers will
“officially” start harvesting after the Easter holidays,
according to the broker. Rainfall has not damaged beans, with
yields and bean size higher than in the previous crop, it said.  Robusta growers in Brazil are expected to harvest between
10.9 million and 11.6 million bags this year, compared with 11.3
million in 2010, the agriculture ministry’s crop-forecasting
agency, known as Conab, said in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
