Chad ’s president, Idriss Deby, will
seek to extend his two-decade rule in the central African nation
in an election April 25 that opposition candidates have pledged
to boycott.  Deby has ruled the landlocked oil- and cotton-producing
nation, which borders six countries including Nigeria, Libya and
 Sudan , since he ousted dictator Hissene Habre in 1990. He has
battled rebels within his own borders and renounced his support
for insurgents in Sudan’s Darfur region after signing a peace
accord with his neighbor in January 2010,  according  to the U.S.
State Department.  The presidential ballot follows a Feb. 13 parliamentary
vote that was held peacefully, according to the European Union
observer  mission  in the country. The election was marred by
technical problems at polling stations including missing voters’
lists.  Three opposition presidential candidates said last month
they would boycott the vote over concerns that the outcome
wouldn’t be fair, Agence France-Presse reported. A similar
boycott took place during the 2006 election, according to the
 news agency .  Chad ranks 163rd out of 169 countries on the United Nations
Development Programme’s  Human Development Index , a broad measure
of quality of life. Growth is projected at 4.1 percent of gross
domestic product, slower than the 2010 rate of 5.1 percent and
the sub-Saharan African outlook of 5.5 percent, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  Chad produced 115,000 barrels of oil a day in 2009,
according to the  U.S. Energy Administration .  To contact the reporter on this story:
