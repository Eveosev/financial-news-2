Uchumi Supermarket Ltd. (UCSP) , a Kenyan
retailer that emerged from receivership in March last year, will
open an outlet in Tanzania’s capital, Dar es Salaam, “any time
now,” Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Ciano said.  The company will open a second branch in Uganda’s capital,
Kampala, in two months’ time and also plans to open a business
in Gulu, Uganda, he told reporters in Nairobi today.  Ciano was among three directors elected during a
 shareholders’ meeting  in Nairobi. The other two are Mahmud
Janmohammed, managing director of  TPS Eastern Africa Ltd. (TPSEA) , the
Kenyan holding company for the Serena chain of hotels, and Kungu
Gatabaki, a former chairman of Housing Finance Ltd., Kenya’s
only publicly traded mortgage company.  Uchumi went into receivership in June 2006 with debts of
2.2 billion shillings ($26 million), of which 957 million
shillings was owed to  Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd. and PTA Bank
Ltd. The receivership ended on March 4 after most of the
company’s debts were cleared and others converted into shares.  The company hopes the Capital Markets Authority, the
industry regulator, will “soon” lift its suspension from
trading on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, Ciano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
