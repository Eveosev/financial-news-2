New York Times Co. (NYT) , publisher of
the namesake newspaper, said more than 100,000 people signed up
for new digital subscriptions, a sign online revenue may help
offset a decline in print advertising and circulation.  Times Co. introduced its so-called paywall March 28 as
readers continue to shift away from print newspapers and toward
the Web. The system requires customers to pay for online content,
often after they have read more than 20 articles.  “That’s a pretty good number,” said Douglas Arthur, an
analyst at Evercore Partners in New York who has an
“overweight” rating on shares and doesn’t own any. “My break-
even number for subscriptions for 12 months is 200,000, and the
Times is already at 100,000 after three weeks.”  First-quarter revenue fell to $566.5 million from $587.9
million a year earlier, the New York-based company said in a
statement today. Analysts had projected $569 million, according
to the average estimate from a Bloomberg survey. Earnings per
share, excluding one-time expenses, were 2 cents, meeting
analysts’ estimates.  First-quarter net income fell to $5.42 million from $12.8
million a year ago. Operating costs increased 0.3 percent to
$506 million, primarily due to higher promotion and newsprint
expense, the company said.  Advertising revenue fell 4.4 percent to $299 million
compared to a year ago, although digital ad sales rose 4.5
percent. Circulation revenue declined 3.7 percent to $228
million.  Website Visitors  “I thought the ad number for the  New York  Times would be
much worse than it was,” said Arthur. “It’s still down, but
not as much as I thought.”  NYTimes.com is the world’s most viewed English-language
newspaper site, receiving about 62 million unique visitors in
the month of March, according to comScore Inc. In the first 12
days after the company instituted its pay wall, site usage fell
between 5 and 15 percent most days, according to Experian
Hitwise.  Times Co. fell 8 cents to $9.04 at 10:10 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock had declined 6.9
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
