Abhishek Shindadkar, an analyst at
ICICIDirect, comments on the fourth-quarter earnings of  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  Shindadkar spoke in a phone interview
from his office in Mumbai today.  Tata Consultancy, the world’s second-largest computer
services provider by market value, posted a 23 percent rise in
its fourth-quarter net income to 24 billion rupees ($542 million)
on sales of 101.6 billion rupees. The shares fell 2.8 percent to
1,185.15 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai.  On the earnings:  “They are a pretty good set of numbers, ahead of our
estimates from all perspectives.”  On the stock’s reaction:  “There may have been huge expectations built in the
performance, a lot of people were expecting growth of as much as
7 percent in sales in U.S. dollar terms.  “The shares may have been primarily driven by these huge
expectations built into the price movement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
