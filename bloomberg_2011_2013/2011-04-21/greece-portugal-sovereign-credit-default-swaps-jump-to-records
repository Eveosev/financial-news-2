The cost of insuring debt sold by
 Greece  and  Portugal  rose to records on concern  Europe â€™s
sovereign crisis is worsening.  Credit-default swaps on Greece jumped 40 basis points to
1,340 basis points according to CMA, signaling a 68 percent
chance of default within five years. Portugal rose 24 basis
points to 662.  That helped push the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe
Index of swaps on 15 governments up by 9.5 basis points to
197.5, the highest since January. The gauge is up from 157.5
basis points April 8, the lowest in five months.  Contracts on Ireland increased 40 basis points to 663,
approaching the record closing level of 674 on Jan. 10, while
Italy rose 6.5 to 155.5 and Spain climbed 9.5 to 253, CMA prices
show. An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit
quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers rose 2.5 basis points to 134.5, and the
subordinated index was 7 higher at 241, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 1 basis point to 364 and
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings rose 0.25 to 99, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($14.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
