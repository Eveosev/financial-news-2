Japanese stocks advanced for a
second day after U.S. companies including  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  reported
increased profits and oil prices surged, signaling the global
economic recovery is accelerating.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest electronics exporter, gained 2
percent.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  and other makers of
semiconductors and related tools advanced after  Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) ,
the biggest maker of mobile-phone chips, reported profit that
topped estimates.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , the country’s No. 1 oil explorer,
rose 3.5 percent.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , Japan’s second-largest
steelmaker, climbed 3.5 percent after saying profit increased.  “The U.S. economic recovery, while still soft, is steadily
recovering,” said  Junichi Misawa , head of equity investment at
Tokyo-based STB Asset Management Co., which oversees about $17
billion. “That affects the global economy. Also, rising
commodity prices reflect strong demand.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.8 percent to 9,685.77
as of the close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix gained 0.5 percent
to 841.72, with eight shares rising for every seven that fell.
The index has declined 9.6 percent since a magnitude-9
earthquake and tsunami on March 11 devastated Japan’s northeast
coast, crippled a nuclear power plant and disrupted supply
chains at companies from Renesas to Toyota Motor Corp.  Tech Shares  Technology shares advanced after Apple reported profit that
almost doubled. Sony gained 2 percent to 2,508 yen.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a
supplier of sensors, soared 4.1 percent to 4,050 yen.  Chip-related companies advanced after Qualcomm’s earnings
beat estimates and an index of U.S. semiconductor shares jumped.
Renesas increased 2.5 percent to 708 yen.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) ,
Japan’s sole manufacturer of PC memory, jumped 3.6 percent to
1,179 yen.  Sumco Corp. (3436) , a maker of silicon wafers, gained 2.5
percent to 1,603 yen.  “U.S. companies, especially tech stocks, are doing well,
and that’s helping to instill confidence,” said  Mitsushige
Akino , who oversees about $600 million in assets in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Investors are looking to
take a little bit more risk.”  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 4.3 percent
yesterday after  Intel Corp ., the world’s biggest chipmaker, said
sales this quarter may beat analyst estimates. The SOX index
rose the most in almost 10 months.  Drillers, Traders  Higher oil and commodity prices boosted energy explorers
and trading houses. Inpex advanced 3.5 percent to 622,000 yen.
 Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the country’s second-largest
oil driller, also gained after crude for June delivery rose the
most in more than a month yesterday.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s No. 1 commodities trader, gained
1.7 percent after the London Metal Exchange Index of six metals
jumped 2.1 percent. Trading house Mitsui & Co. advanced 1.9
percent to 1,425 yen.  Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-largest carmaker, rose 3.2
percent to 746 yen after it said this month it will start to
boost shipments of Leaf battery-electric cars to the U.S., where
it has made about 500 deliveries since late December.  JFE Holdings jumped 3.5 percent to 2,249 yen after posting
operating profit that more than doubled from a year earlier.
Operating profit rose to 182.8 billion yen ($2.23 billion) in
the 12 months through March, beating the company’s forecast of
180 billion yen.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the crippled Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, dropped the most on the Nikkei, losing
4.9 percent to 423 yen. The Japanese government today said it
will impose a 20-kilometer (12 mile) no-entry zone around the
Fukushima plant, which is leaking radiation.  “The impact from  Japan ’s earthquake is weighing on the
economy in a lot of ways, STB Asset’s Misawa said. “No one
knows how bad power shortages will be or when they will end.
That means there’s a limit to how high Japanese stocks can go.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
