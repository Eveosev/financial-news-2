Cotton imports by  China , the
biggest buyer, fell 14.6 percent in March from a year ago, as
lower yarn prices cut into profits for the  textile industry ,
reducing demand.  Inbound shipments were 276,436 metric tons, compared with
323,780 tons a year earlier and 180,000 tons in February,
General Administration of Customs data showed today.  Cotton reached a record last month before tumbling into a
 bear market  on speculation that global output, including in the
U.S. and  India , is set to increase. Plantings in some areas have
fallen as record prices failed to spur increased acreage,
China’s top economic planning agency said this week.  “The textile mills’ profits have declined quickly along
with yarn prices, so they’ve become a bit short of cash,” Dong
Shuzhi, manager at Shanghai Jinhuicheng International Trade Co.,
said today.  The average local textile mills’ profit margin dropped to
169 yuan ($25.90) a ton in April, from 1,360 yuan a month
earlier, according to a recent survey by Jinhuicheng. About 70
percent of the textile mills surveyed said they remained
pessimistic about the outlook of the market, it said.  Cotton on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  reached an all-time
high of $2.1970 per pound on March 7. The July-delivery contract
dropped 0.6 percent to to $1.66 today, bringing the fall since
the record to 24 percent. A slump of 20
percent or more signifies a bear market to some investors.  About 55 percent of China’s cotton imports in March were
from the U.S., followed by India and Uzbekistan, at 31 percent
and 7 percent, respectively, the China Cotton Association said
in an earlier statement.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors:  Richard Dobson , Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
