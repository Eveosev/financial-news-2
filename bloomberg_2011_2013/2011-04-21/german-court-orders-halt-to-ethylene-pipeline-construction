The administrative court of
Stuttgart ordered a halt to the construction of an ethylene
pipeline in  Germany  planned by  BASF SE (BAS)  and six other companies
on concern the infrastructure runs too close to housing.  The stoppage is for the section between the German towns of
Aalen and Rudersberg in the southwest of the country, said
Ulrike Zeitler, a spokeswoman for the  court . EPS Ethylen-
Pipeline Sued, the project company, can file a complaint at a
court in Mannheim within two weeks, she said today by phone.  EPS will enter a complaint and is “confident” the court
in Mannheim will overturn the Stuttgart court order, Klaus
Thiel, a spokesman for the pipeline company, said by phone. The
court’s concern that the pipe shouldn’t run less than 350 meters
from the buildings doesn’t have basis in German law, he said.
Ethylene is a gas used to make plastics.  EPS is owned by Basell Polyolefine GmbH, BASF, Borealis
Polymere GmbH,  Clariant AG (CLN) ,  OMV AG (OMV) , Vinnolit GmbH and  Wacker
Chemie AG. (WCH)  The pipeline, which will cover about 360 kilometers
(220 miles) between Muenchmuenster in Bavaria and Ludwigshafen
in Rhineland-Palatinate, should be commissioned this year,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
