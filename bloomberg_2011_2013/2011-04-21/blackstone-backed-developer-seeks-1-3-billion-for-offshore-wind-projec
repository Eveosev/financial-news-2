WindMW GmbH , a German developer
backed by the world’s largest private-equity firm  Blackstone
Group LP (BX) , is seeking about 900 million euros ($1.3 billion) in
loans to finance a wind farm in the North Sea.  WindMW presented details of its 288-megawatt Meerwind
project to potential investors at a meeting yesterday in
Frankfurt, Jens Assheuer, a managing director at the
Bremerhaven-based company, said today in a phone interview.  He said the project received some commitments before the
meeting, though no contracts have been signed, and New York-
based Blackstone will make an equity investment. Assheuer did
not provide additional details.  WindMW plans to begin construction 23 kilometers (14 miles)
northwest of the island of Helgoland at the end of 2012, and the
project is expected to start generating electricity in 2013.  Germany  is planning to build 10 gigawatts of  offshore wind 
projects in the next decade to meet climate targets. After the
nuclear disaster at in Japan’s Fukushima power plant, German
Chancellor Angela Merkel is seeking to shift its  energy policy 
away from nuclear power.  WindMW consulted the  European Investment Bank  over
financing for the project. Assheuer said the company is no
longer in talks with the lending arm of the European Union
because WindMW seeks to complete a transaction faster than the
agency’s procedures would allow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
