Gasoline inventories in independent
storage in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub
fell to the lowest level in more than three months, according to
PJK International BV.  Gasoline stockpiles plunged 21 percent to 644,000 metric
tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher based
in Oosterhout in the Netherlands. That’s the lowest since Dec.
30 even as supplies arrived from Aruba, Russia and the U.K.  “Apart from the normal flows to  Nigeria  and the U.S.,
there was a very large cargo to  China ,” Patrick Kulsen,
commercial director at PJK, said in a telephone interview.  Gasoil inventories decreased 4.4 percent to 2.54 million
tons, according to the weekly PJK data. That’s the least since
March 17. Contracted volumes of the fuel, which includes heating
oil and diesel, left the ARA-area for Gibraltar, the data
showed. Cargoes arrived from Canada,  Russia  and the U.S.  “Many barges were also loaded with diesel-quality fuel to
 Germany ,” Kulsen said. It was about 100,000 tons, he said.  Naphtha, used in gasoline and petrochemicals production,
dropped 30 percent to 40,000 tons, the lowest since March 17,
according to the data.  Fuel oil declined 6.6 percent to 678,000 tons, the least
since March 3, according to PJK data. A very large crude carrier
is loading for  Singapore , the data showed. Cargoes arrived from
 Brazil ,  France , Lithuania and Russia.  Jet fuel rose 4.4 percent to 624,000 tons on imports from
 India  and the United Arab Emirates.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
