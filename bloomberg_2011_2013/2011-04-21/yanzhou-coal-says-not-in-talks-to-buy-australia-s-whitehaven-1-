Yanzhou Coal Mining Co.,  China ’s
fourth-biggest coal producer, said it isn’t in talks to buy
 Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC)  after an initial assessment, prompting a
plunge in the Australian company’s shares.  “We are currently not in any talks to buy Whitehaven,”
Board Secretary Zhang Baocai said by phone from  Canada . “We
currently don’t have any special interest in it. We have looked
at this target but that doesn’t mean we will necessarily buy
it.”  Whitehaven, which put itself up for sale in October, said
earlier today that Yanzhou was on a shortlist of buyers and
hadn’t been advised of any change of status. The Sydney-based
company made the statement after DealReporter said Yanzhou
wouldn’t proceed with an offer.  Whitehaven plunged as much as 6.3 percent after the Yanzhou
comment, the biggest decline since May 20, to trade as low as
A$6.65. Shares in the company, which had moved as high as A$6.98
after the Whitehaven statement on the shortlist, closed down 4.5
percent at A$6.78 at the 4:10 p.m. close of trade in Sydney.  Purchasing Whitehaven would give a buyer four mines and
projects in New South Wales’ Gunnedah basin that produce
pulverized coal for steelmaking as well as energy coal.  Chinese and Indian companies have stepped up acquisitions
of coal companies to meet growing demand from  power plants  and
steel mills. Yanzhou Coal bought  Australia ’s Felix Resources
Ltd. in 2009 for A$3.5 billion ($3.8 billion). Whitehaven said
on April 13 a number of parties had submitted formal proposals.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
