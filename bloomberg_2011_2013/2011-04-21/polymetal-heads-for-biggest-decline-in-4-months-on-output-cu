OAO Polymetal slid the most in 4
months after the Russian gold and silver producer cut its 2011
output forecast yesterday.  The shares fell 3.8 percent to 532.9 rubles at the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since Dec. 10, even as
gold climbed to a record high in London and  New York  for a fifth
day.  The company cut its forecast for output of the precious
metals this year due to “schedule setbacks” at its Amursk and
Omolon projects, the company said in a statement yesterday.
Polymetal cut its target range for gold output to 470,000 to
500,000 ounces from 620,000 to 660,000 ounces, according to the
statement.  “Investors are still digesting the cuts in the guidance
yesterday,” Tom Mundy, chief strategist at Otkritie Financial
Corp. said by phone in Moscow. “The market is trading the
company, not the underlying commodity. You can see that quite
well with Polyus, which is holding up much better.”  OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s biggest producer of the metal,
gained 3.3 percent to 1,776.6 rubles, the highest price since
Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
