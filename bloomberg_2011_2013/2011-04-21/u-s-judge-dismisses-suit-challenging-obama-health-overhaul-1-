A federal judge in  New Jersey 
dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the
Obama administration’s health-care law.  U.S. District Judge Freda Wolfson ruled that two men who
sued without a lawyer, Nicholas Purpura and Donald R. Laster
Jr., lack legal standing to challenge the 2010 Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act. They claimed the law’s
requirement that almost every American have some form of medical
insurance starting in 2014 was unconstitutional.  Purpura is 68 and claims he would lose “Medicare
Advantage,” while Laster is handicapped and said that as a
result of the law, he would “be tax[sic] on medical devices
that cross state lines, and will suffer restrictions to certain
drugs,” Wolfson wrote.  The plaintiffs alleged “few, if any, facts demonstrating
the effect that the act has on them currently or the effect that
the act will have in the future,” Wolfson ruled in federal
court in Trenton. “These allegations fail to establish
plaintiffs’ standing to challenge any of the provision of the
act.”  Twenty five states have joined in the lawsuit filed a year
ago by then-Florida Attorney General  Bill McCollum . Last month,
a U.S. appeals court in Atlanta put on an expedited schedule the
federal government’s appeal of a judge’s decision throwing out
the Obama administration’s health-care law.  The case is Purpura v. Sebelius, 10-cv-4814, U.S. District
Court, District of New Jersey (Trenton).  To contact the reporter on this story:
