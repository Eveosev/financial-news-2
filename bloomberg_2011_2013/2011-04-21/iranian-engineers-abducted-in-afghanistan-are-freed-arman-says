Twelve Iranian engineers abducted
by armed men in  Afghanistan  this week were released,  Arman 
reported, citing Fadahossein Maleki,  Iran ’s ambassador in Kabul.  The engineers were released after negotiations between the
Iranian embassy and the Afghan government, the ambassador said,
without providing details, Arman reported.  The 12 Iranians worked for an Iranian construction company
that was building a road to Farah, in southwestern Afghanistan;
they were abducted, along with several Afghans who worked for
the company, and taken to an unknown location, Arman said.  Iranian officials said the kidnapping wasn’t politically
motivated, rejecting claims that the men had been seized by
Taliban militants, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
