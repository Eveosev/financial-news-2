Air Zimbabwe is resuming its
flights today after pilots ended a strike over back pay, the
 Herald  newspaper reported, citing Innocent Mavhunga, acting
chief executive at the state-owned airline.  The pilots began the strike on March 22 to demand the
payment of salaries and benefits owed to them since February
last year, the state-controlled Herald said. The government
agreed to pay the pilots about 67 percent of what they were
owed, the Herald said, citing unidentified officials.  Mavhunga said he couldnâ€™t reveal the details of the
agreement for reasons of confidentiality, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
