Apax Partners LLP will cut the amount
of leveraged loans it will raise for the buyout of  France
Telecom  SAâ€™s Orange Switzerland mobile-phone unit by about 33
percent to 567 million Swiss francs ($620 million) after
increasing the bond portion of the financing.  The seven-year term-loan B targeting non-bank lenders will
be cut to 242 million francs from 400 million francs and the
six-year facility for capital expenditure will be canceled,
according to two people with knowledge of the transaction. The
six-year 225 million franc term-loan A and revolving credit are
unchanged, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the deal is private.  Apax is adding floating-rate notes amounting to 150 million
euros ($198 million) and boosting an issue of senior secured
bonds by 30 percent to 425 million francs as part of the buyout
financing, the people said.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and UBS AG are arranging
the 1.4 billion-franc loan and bond financing, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Apax agreed to buy Orange  Switzerland  for 1.6 billion
euros, France Telecom said in a statement Dec. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
