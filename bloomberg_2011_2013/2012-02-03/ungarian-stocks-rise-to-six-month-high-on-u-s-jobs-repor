Hungarian shares rose to the highest
in six months and the forint advanced after a report showed that
the  U.S. economy  added more jobs last month than economists had
predicted.  The benchmark BUX stock  index  added 0.7 percent to
19,665.68 by the close in Budapest, the third day of gains. The
gauge has added 2 percent in the past five days for a fourth
week of advances, the longest such run since September 2010. The
forint appreciated 0.3 percent to 290.91 per euro, capping a
fifth week of gains.  The 243,000 increase in U.S. payrolls was the most since
April and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey,
Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The unemployment
rate dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
