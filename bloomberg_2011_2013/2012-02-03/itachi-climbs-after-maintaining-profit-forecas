Hitachi Ltd. (6501) ,  Japan ’s second-largest
manufacturer, jumped the most in more than 10 months in Tokyo
trading after keeping its annual profit forecast unchanged.  Hitachi jumped as much as 7.5 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since March 30, to 429 yen before trading at 428 yen as of
10:41 a.m. on the  Tokyo Stock Exchange (TPX) . The benchmark Nikkei 225
Stock Average fell 0.2 percent  The company yesterday  forecast  operating income of 400
billion yen ($5.2 billion) for the year ending March 31, keeping
its November estimate, citing higher-than-expected orders for
auto parts. That contrasts with rivals  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  who reduced their forecasts earlier
this week.  “Investors are praising Hitachi for managing to maintain
its forecast when its peers are all cutting,” said Yuichi Ishida, a Tokyo-based analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities
Co., who has an “outperform”  rating  on the stock.  Today’s gain boosted Hitachi’s advance this year to 5.9
percent,  compared  with a 4.7 percent climb for the  Nikkei 225 .  Hitachi is accelerating moves to cut costs at its
television business, where it already planned to end domestic
production in September, the company said yesterday. Flat-panel
television shipments fell 59 percent in Japan in December, after
government subsidies expired, the Japan Electronics and
Information Technology Industries Association  said  Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
