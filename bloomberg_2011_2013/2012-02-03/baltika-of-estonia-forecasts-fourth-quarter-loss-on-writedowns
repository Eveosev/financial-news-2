AS Baltika, the Baltic region’s
third-largest clothing retailer, said it will report a
“significant” loss for the fourth quarter, citing one-time
write-offs and provisions.  The Tallinn-based company’s net assets were below half the
company’s share capital as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
