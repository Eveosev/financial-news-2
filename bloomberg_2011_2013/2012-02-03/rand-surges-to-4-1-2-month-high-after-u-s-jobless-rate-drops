The rand surged to a 4 1/2-month high
against the dollar, set for a fourth weekly gain, after the U.S.
jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to the lowest in three years,
boosting demand for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency appreciated as much as 1.4 percent
to 7.5425 per dollar, the strongest level since Sept. 19. It
traded 0.9 percent firmer at 7.5760 as of 3:52 p.m. in
Johannesburg, bringing its advance this week to 2.2 percent.
Against the euro, it gained 1 percent to 9.9437.  A gauge of  emerging-market stocks  rose for a fourth day and
South Africa’s benchmark stock  index  reversed a decline after a
Labor Department report showed unemployment in the U.S. dropped
to 8.3 percent in January, the lowest since February 2009. The
243,000 increase in payrolls was the most since April and
exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  “It was a much better number than anyone expected,”
Nomvuyo Guma, a currency strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd.
in Johannesburg, said by phone. “It added to the risk-on
sentiment in the market.”  Earlier, the rand strengthened on speculation South
Africa’s central bank will leave its benchmark lending rate
unchanged this year, maintaining the currency’s yield advantage
over the dollar and euro.  The  Federal Reserve  signaled last month it will leave
 interest rates  low through 2014 and may embark on a third round
of asset purchases, while the  European Central Bank  cut its
benchmark rate twice last year to 1 percent, fueling demand for
higher-yielding assets, including South African bonds.  Foreign investors bought a net 7 billion rand ($919
million) of South African bonds since Jan. 19, when the central
bank left its repo rate at 5.5 percent, maintaining the rand’s
yield advantage over the dollar and euro.  ‘Firmer Rand’  “Expect inflows to local bonds to persist in months ahead,
as the global search for yield becomes entrenched,”  George Glynos , an analyst at ETM Analytics in Johannesburg, said in e-
mailed comments. “The bias for now remains in favour of a
firmer rand.”  The rand has returned 6.7 percent this year for investors
who borrow dollars to invest in higher-yielding currencies,
known as the carry trade, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  South Africa’s 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 gained, driving
the yield down one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.64 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
