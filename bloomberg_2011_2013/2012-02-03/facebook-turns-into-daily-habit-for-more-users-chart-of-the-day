Facebook  Inc. has not only signed up
hundreds of millions of subscribers, it is also increasingly
playing host to them daily.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the percentage of users that
paid visits to the largest social-networking website each day,
rather than monthly, in each quarter for the past three years.
The chart is compiled from data in Facebook’s filing for its
initial public offering. Daily figures are averages for the
final month of each quarter.  In last year’s fourth quarter, 57 percent of users went to
Facebook daily. The proportion climbed from a low of 44 percent
in the second quarter of 2009.  Facebook cited these kinds of percentage figures as an
indicator of “user engagement” in the filing, made two days
ago. The document also noted that the  Menlo Park , California-
based company tracks the number of average daily users. Daily
visitors rose 48 percent last year, to 483 million. The number
of monthly users stood at 845 million as of Dec. 31.  “Users aren’t going away,”  Jeff Clavier , the founder of
SoftTech VC in  Palo Alto ,  California , told Bloomberg Television
yesterday in an interview.  Facebook’s ability to retain subscribers will do much to
determine the IPO’s pricing, said Clavier, who is a shareholder.
Facebook is considering a $75 billion to $100 billion valuation,
people with knowledge of the matter said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
