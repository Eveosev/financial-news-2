  Eli Lilly & Co.  will freeze salaries
for most employees worldwide this year, as sales of its best-
selling drug declined faster than expected after losing patent
protection.  John Lechleiter , Lilly’s chief executive officer, requested
no increase in his $1.5 million base salary or incentives “in
light of the business challenges the company faces,” the
Indianapolis-based drugmaker said today in a filing.
Lechleiter’s total compensation will be about $16.4 million,
according to the filing.  “Similarly, employees in most countries worldwide,
including the named executive officers, will not receive base
pay increases in 2012,” Lilly said. No change was made in how
bonuses are structured,  Mark Taylor , a spokesman for the
company, said in an e-mail. Lilly has an estimated 38,000
employees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Last month the company provided 2012 forecasts that missed
analyst estimates and said sales of its antipsychotic Zyprexa
were falling faster than expected after facing generic
competition beginning in October. Zyprexa revenue declined 44
percent in the fourth-quarter to $749.6 million, the company
said on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
