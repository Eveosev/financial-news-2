Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  approached a record in
 London  trading after signing production-sharing agreements with
Uganda, paving the way for the U.K. oil explorer to secure
partnerships with  Total SA (FP)  and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)   Tullow has been awaiting government approval after agreeing
in March to sell one-third stakes in its Ugandan finds to Total
and Cnooc for $2.9 billion. Today’s accords, which include the
Kingfisher field production license, mark “a vital step” in
advancing the project in the Lake Albert basin, Chief Executive
Officer Aidan Heavey said in a statement.  The shares rose 1.5 percent to close at 1,462 pence, 31
pence short of the peak on March 7.  “We can now move forward in closing the farmdown”
agreement, George Cazenove, a London-based spokesman at Tullow,
said by phone. Chief Financial Officer Ian Springett on Jan. 18
indicated that the deal could have been completed last month.  “The agreement removes the major barrier to completing”
the transaction,  Oswald Clint , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co. in London, wrote in an e-mailed report. “There
is also a stabilization clause in this morning’s agreement,
which protects Tullow’s investment in the country (e.g. against
tax increases) and was agreed upon by all parties.”  The Ugandan government has been delaying the partnership
approval since at least October over contractual disagreements
and an oil industry corruption investigation. The partners may
invest about $10 billion to produce more than 200,000 barrels of
oil a day as soon as 2015.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
