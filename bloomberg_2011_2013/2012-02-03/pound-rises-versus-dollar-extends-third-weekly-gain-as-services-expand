The pound rose against the dollar,
extending a third weekly advance, after a gauge of services
activity unexpectedly climbed to a 10-month high in January.  U.K. two-year notes advanced for a second day after the
Treasury sold 3.5 billion pounds ($5.55 billion) of 28-, 92- and
182-day bills. Today’s purchasing managers’ index report came
after an industry group said the economy has slipped back into a
recession.  Bank of England  policy maker  Adam Posen  said
yesterday there’s an argument for officials to expand their
asset-purchase program next week to boost the economy.  “After all the bad press and the recent think-tank
suggesting recession, the U.K. services PMI pops up this morning
on a storming number,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “It kicked
sterling up. Also there’s a safe-haven theme as various large
investors around the planet are looking for alternative places
to invest surplus cash.”  The pound gained 0.1 percent to $1.5823 at 1:02 p.m. London
time, extending this week’s advance to 0.6 percent. Sterling was
little changed at 83.15 pence per euro, having appreciated 1.1
percent over the past five days.  The  index of U.K. services  rose to 56 in January, the
highest since March, from 54 in December, Markit Economics and
the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said today in
an e-mailed report.  Growth Outlook  U.K. gross domestic product will fall 0.2 percent this
quarter after declining by the same amount in the three months
through December, and the economy will grow less than previously
forecast over the next two years, the National Institute for
Economic and Social Research said.  The two-year gilt yield fell two basis points to 0.36
percent. The 2.25 percent note due March 2014 rose 0.025, or 25
pence per 1,000 pound face amount, to 103.915. The 10-year gilt
yield dropped one basis point to 2.08 percent.  Investors bid for 2.51 times the amount of 92-day
securities on offer at today’s auction, compared with a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.52 in a sale of 91-day securities on Jan. 27.
Demand for the 182-day bills rose to 3.49 times, from a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.76 at a Jan. 27 offering. The average yield of
both securities increased from their previous sales.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.7 percent this
year, while German  government bonds  fell 0.1 percent, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies.  The pound has weakened 0.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 2.6 percent,
and the euro slid 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
