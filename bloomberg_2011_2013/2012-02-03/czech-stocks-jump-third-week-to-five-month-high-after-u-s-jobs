Czech stocks surged for a third week,
reaching the highest in five months, after a report showed U.S.
payrolls increased more than forecast, boosting demand for
riskier assets.  The  PX (PX)  equity gauge jumped 1.1 percent to 1,009.80 at 4:28
p.m. in  Prague , the first time it closed above 1,000 since Sept.
8. The benchmark added 4.3 percent in the week and 11 percent
this year.  New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the countryâ€™s biggest coking-coal
producer, jumped 4 percent to 160 koruna.  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA
and  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  climbed more than 10
percent, making them best performers in the index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
