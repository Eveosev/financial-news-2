Drug-resistant tuberculosis rose to
record levels in 2007-2010, and the highest prevalence was found
in parts of eastern  Europe  and central Asia, a study found.  In Russia’s Murmansk region, the treatment-defying strain
of the disease accounted for 29 percent of new and previously
treated cases, and in Moldova it was 65 percent, researchers
from the  World Health Organization   wrote  in the agency’s
Bulletin.  Global trends in multi-drug resistant tuberculosis remain
unclear because data are lacking from large countries including
India and several African nations, said the researchers, who
surveyed 80 countries and eight territories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
