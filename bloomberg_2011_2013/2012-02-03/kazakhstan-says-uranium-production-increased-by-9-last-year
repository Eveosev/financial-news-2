Kazakhstan increased uranium
production about 9 percent last year, accounting for about 35
percent of the world’s output last year, according to
Kazatomprom, the state nuclear company.  The Central Asian country produced 19,450 metric tons of
uranium in 2011, the Astana-based company said by e-mail today.
That compares with 17,803 tons the previous year, according to
its website. Kazatomprom said it mined 11,079 tons of the
country’s uranium last year, without giving a comparison.  Kazakhstan, the world’s biggest uranium producer according
to the  World Nuclear Association , had planned to produce as much
as 19,900 tons of the radioactive metal in 2011,  Kazatomprom
said last year. Uranium output will probably rise to 21,346 tons
in 2012, Kazatomprom said in December.  Kazatomprom’s net income probably reached 77.3 billion
tenge ($520 million), sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, which
owns the nuclear company, said today in a  posting  in its Twitter
Inc. account, citing Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Shkolnik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
