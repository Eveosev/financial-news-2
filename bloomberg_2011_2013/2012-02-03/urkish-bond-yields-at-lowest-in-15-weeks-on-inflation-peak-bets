Turkish bonds rose, pushing yields to
the lowest in 3 1/2 months on speculation  inflation  has peaked
at 10.6 percent in January.  Yields (BENCH)  on the benchmark two-year bond fell 8 basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 9.29 percent at the 5:00 p.m. close
in Istanbul, a Turk Ekonomi Bankasi index of the securities
showed. This level of yields is the lowest since Oct. 20,
increasing the week’s drop to 31 basis points. The lira
strengthened 0.2 percent at 1.7536 per dollar, lifting its
weekly appreciation to 1.3 percent.  Annualised inflation rose to 10.6 percent in January, the
highest since November 2008, after the monthly figure increased
by 0.6 percent, the statistics agency based in Ankara said on
its website today. The median estimate of seven economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for 10.5 percent, the level price increases
reached in December.  “Turkish inflation is likely to have peaked at 10.6
percent,”  Tevfik Aksoy , London-based chief economist for the
region at  Morgan Stanley & Co ., said in an e-mailed note, citing
the lira’s gains this year, which rose 7.9 percent against the
dollar.  The lira slumped 18 percent in the biggest decline
worldwide and yields soared 390 basis points last year as a
widening current-account deficit and worries about the European
debt crisis and Middle East revolts shook investor confidence in
 Turkey .  “We continue to expect year-on-year headline inflation to
drop as of April, May,” Simon Quijano-Evans, London-based
economist at ING Groep NV, said in e-mailed comments.  The Turkish central bank expects inflation to slow to 6.5
percent this year, Governor Erdem Basci said at a news
conference this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
