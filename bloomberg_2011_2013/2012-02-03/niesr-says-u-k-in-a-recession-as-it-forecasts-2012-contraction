The  U.K. economy  has slipped back
into a recession and will grow less than previously forecast
over the next two years, the National Institute for Economic and
Social Research said.  Gross domestic product will fall 0.2 percent this quarter
after declining by the same amount in the three months through
December, the institute said in a report in London today. It
forecasts that the economy will shrink 0.1 percent this year and
grow 2.3 percent in 2013, compared with previous projections in
October for growth of 0.8 percent and 2.6 percent respectively.  Bank of England  policy maker  Adam Posen  said yesterday
there is an argument for officials to expand their so-called
quantitative easing program by 75 billion pounds ($119 billion)
next week. Niesr, which said there are “downside” risks to the
U.K. outlook, cut its forecasts for global growth and said the
euro area faces a “mild recession” as leaders struggle to end
the region’s debt crisis.  “The flat economy is only temporary, but that is
dependent” on “decisive action” in the euro area, said  Simon Kirby , a senior research fellow at Niesr. “Risks are still
weighted to the downside.”  Niesr, which sees the U.K. economy growing 0.1 percent in
the second quarter of 2012, revised its unemployment forecasts.
It now sees the jobless rating averaging 8.9 percent this year
and 8.5 percent in 2013, compared with 8.7 percent and 8.2
percent previously.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  should consider
a short-term stimulus to support the economy, according to
Niesr. Jonathan Portes, director of the institute, said the
government should spend at least 15 billion pounds on
infrastructure programs and cut National Insurance
contributions.  The global economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and 4
percent in 2013, Niesr said. The 2012 estimate is between 0.75
percentage point and 1 percentage point below what the group
would consider trend growth, so could be described as a “world
recession,” Niesr senior research fellow Dawn Holland said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
