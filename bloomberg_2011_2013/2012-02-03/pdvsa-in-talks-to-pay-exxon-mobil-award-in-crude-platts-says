Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state
oil company, is negotiating with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  to pay an
arbitration award in crude oil instead of cash, Platts reported
today, citing a government source it did not name.  The New York-based International Chamber of Commerce
awarded Exxon a net $746.9 million in December for oil assets
seized by Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  in 2007. PDVSA, as
the Caracas-based company is called, said on Jan. 2 that it
would pay $255 million in cash for the judgment, after
accounting for about $300 million in a frozen bank account and
$191 million of Exxon debt that the Venezuelan company will
cancel.  Click here for web link   To contact the reporter on this story:
