Santos Brasil Participacoes SA (STBP3) , the
country’s  largest shipping  container operator, climbed to the
highest in almost five months after earnings beat estimates as
China-led demand boost the country’s commodity exports.  Santos, based in the namesake port city south of  Sao Paulo ,
 rose  3.7 percent to 29.76 reais at 4:12 p.m., the highest
intraday price since Sept. 12. Earlier it surged 7.2 percent in
Sao Paulo.  The company, which handles coffee, sugar and other exports
from three Brazilian ports, reported rising revenue and profits
as shipments from Latin America’s largest economy increase.  Santos had “a strong set of results, combining good
revenue growth and a hefty margin expansion,” Renata Faber and
Thiago Macruz, analysts at Sao Paulo-based  Banco Itau (ITUB4)  BBA SA,
said in a report yesterday. “The main positive highlight
continues to be the warehousing operation, with a strong revenue
growth relative to 2011.”  Fourth-quarter net income climbed to 74.6 million reais
($43.4 million) from 58.1 million a year earlier, Santos said
yesterday after markets closed. The result beat the 52.9
million-real average estimate of five analysts compiled by
 Bloomberg. (STBP11)   Earnings per share of 56.9 centavos in the fourth quarter
exceeded an average estimate of 39 centavos, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
