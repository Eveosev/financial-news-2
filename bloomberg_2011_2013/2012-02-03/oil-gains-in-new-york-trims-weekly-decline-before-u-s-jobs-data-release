(Corrects yesterday’s Brent price in fifth paragraph.)  Oil traded near a six-week low before
a report forecast to show the U.S. added fewer jobs last month
than in December.  Brent crude ’s premium to the comparable New
York contract is set for the largest weekly gain in a month.  Futures were little changed after dropping for a fifth day
yesterday in the longest losing streak since August. The U.S.
added 140,000 jobs last month after gaining 200,000 in December,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists before a U.S.
Labor Department report today. London-traded Brent’s  premium  to
West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, widened 34
percent this week to the most since Nov. 12.  “Investors will be watching the release of the jobs data,
which is a key leading indicator for economic activity and
therefore energy demand,” said  Michael McCarthy , chief market
strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney. “Concerns
about demand has led to some pretty heavy selling in West Texas.
Brent has held its ground, so we have seen that spread widen.”  Crude for March delivery was at $96.56 a barrel, up 20
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:32 p.m.  Singapore  time. The contract fell 1.3 percent to
$96.36 yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 19. Prices are down 3.1
percent this week, the most since the week ended Dec. 16.  Brent oil for March settlement climbed as much as 0.4
percent to $112.47 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
It gained 51 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $112.07 yesterday and is
up 0.8 percent this week. The European benchmark contract’s
premium to WTI was at $15.92, the widest in 12 weeks.  Cushing Supplies  West Texas futures fell this week on signs of surging
stockpiles at the  Cushing (DOESCROK) , Oklahoma, delivery point for the New
York contract as output increased in  Canada  and  North Dakota .  Inventories at Cushing climbed by 1.48 million barrels to
30.1 million in the week ended Jan. 27, the highest level since
Dec. 16, according to U.S. Energy Department released Feb. 1.  The supply increase has pushed the March contract to a
discount of $2.61 a barrel to December futures. This market
situation, known as a contango, means later deliveries are more
expensive than prompt supplies. As recently as Jan. 3, the
nearer-term contract was at a premium of $1.85.  As stockpiles at Cushing increased 6.5 percent in the past
two weeks, WTI’s discount to Brent crude, the European benchmark,
widened to $15.71 a barrel Feb. 2 from $9.90 on Jan. 18 on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Demand Driven  “The big increase in inventories in the U.S. has led to
weakness in West Texas,” said CMC’s McCarthy. “Normally oil is
a supply-side equation, but the trading overnight was more
demand-side driven.”  U.S. gasoline  consumption  decreased to 7.97 million barrels
a day, the lowest since September 2001, according to the Energy
Department data. Stockpiles of the fuel increased 3.02 million
barrels last week, the report showed.  OPEC will increase shipments this month on rising winter
demand in the northern hemisphere, according to tanker-tracker
Oil Movements.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will ship
23.52 million barrels a day in the four weeks to Feb. 18, 1.1
percent more than the 23.26 million barrels in the period to Jan.
