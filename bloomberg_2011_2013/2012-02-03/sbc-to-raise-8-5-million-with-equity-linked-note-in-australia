HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  plans to raise as
much as A$8 million ($8.5 million) with a five-year equity-
linked product it is offering to individual investors in
 Australia .  “We would be disappointed if we didn’t raise between A$5
to A$8 million,” Ian Collins, Sydney-based head of sales for
global markets at HSBC Bank Australia Ltd., a unit of HSBC, said
in a telephone interview on Jan. 31.  The product, called 100+ Series International Equity
Investment, is linked to the S&P/ASX 200, Swiss Market Index,
MSCI Singapore Free Index, and Taiwan TAIEX Index, according to
an HSBC  statement  detailing the offering.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
