Ukraine will sell stakes in two power
distributor companies,  Centrenergo (CEEN)  and  Donbasenergo (DOEN)  in June this
year, the countryâ€™s state property fund said.  A 53 percent holding in PAT DAK Centrenergo and a 61
percent interest in PAT Donbasenergo will be offered for sale,
the fund said on its website today.  Centrenergo supplies power to consumers in the capital Kiev
and in the Kharkiv and Donetsk regions in the east of Ukraine.
