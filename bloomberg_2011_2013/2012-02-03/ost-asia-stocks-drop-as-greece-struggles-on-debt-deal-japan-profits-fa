Most Asian  stocks  fell, dragging a
regional benchmark index from a three-month high, as companies
from  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  to  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) 
reported weaker earnings amid  Europe ’s debt crisis and an
uncertain U.S. economic outlook.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , a Japanese glassmaker, slumped 12
percent in  Tokyo  after forecasting a 3 billion yen ($39 million)
loss for the year ending March 31 on slumping demand in Europe,
its top market. Singapore Airlines, the world’s No. 2 carrier by
market value, fell 3.6 percent as third-quarter profit tumbled
53 percent. Hynix Semiconductor, the world’s second-largest
maker of computer-memory chips, slid 3.7 percent after posting a
wider-than-expected loss.  “There’s still a lot of headwinds out there in terms of
global growth, particularly in Europe,” said Belinda Allen, a
senior investment analyst at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management in Sydney, which oversees about $145 billion. “We’ll
have to see whether U.S. data can continue to improve before we
can feel a bit more confident on putting more money on risk
assets.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 124.41 as
of 7:18 p.m. in Tokyo, paring this week’s gain to 1.1 percent.
About five shares fell for every four that rose in the gauge,
which posted in January its biggest monthly advance since
September 2010 on signs  China  will ease lending curbs, the U.S.
economy is improving and Europe is containing its debt crisis.  China Policy  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  declined 0.5 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index slipped 0.6 percent, while Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index lost 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
added 0.1 percent, after swinging between gains and losses at
least nine times.  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.8 percent after a
report showed the nation’s non-manufacturing industries expanded
at a slower pace last month, spurring speculation the central
bank may take more measures to boost economic growth.  “Though China’s growth is slowing, it won’t be a hard
landing,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River
Fund Management Co. “ Monetary policy  is starting to ease and
the market’s expectations of a reserve-requirement cut are
rising. Stocks are also really cheap now.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advancedd 0.2
percent. The gauge added 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday as
reports showed claims for U.S. jobless benefits fell last week
and productivity cooled in the fourth quarter.  ‘Outlook Remains Uncertain’  U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
lawmakers in prepared remarks yesterday that the  U.S. economy 
still faces risks, including from fiscal deficits that must be
reduced in the long term.  “Fortunately, over the past few months, indicators of
spending, production, and job-market activity have shown some
signs of improvement,” Bernanke said. “The outlook remains
uncertain, however, and close monitoring of economic
developments will remain necessary.” He also said the Fed
expects inflation to “remain subdued.”  Companies that receive revenue from Europe declined amid
concern the region’s debt crisis won’t be contained. Greece and
its creditors have yet to come to an agreement about a week
since discussions with bondholders started.  A Greek debt deal could be reached “in the coming weeks,
maybe days,” said  Josef Ackermann , chairman of the Institute of
International Finance. Ackermann, also Chief Executive Officer
of Deutsche Bank AG, may travel to Athens this weekend for talks
over a swap involving Greek debt with a face value of 200
billion euros.  Earnings Performance  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s biggest maker of consumer
electronics that gets about 20 percent of sales from Europe,
fell 1.3 percent to 1.066 million won in Seoul.  Shimano Inc. (7309) ,
the Japanese bicycle parts maker that counts Europe as its
biggest market, slipped 3.9 percent to 3,795 yen in Tokyo.  Nippon Sheet Glass, which is also dependent on Europe,
slumped 12 percent to 132 yen after forecasting a 3 billion-yen
full-year loss and saying it will cut 3,500 jobs.  More than half of the 288 companies on the Asian benchmark
index that have reported earnings since Jan. 9 have missed
estimates, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg News.  Singapore Airlines slipped 3.6 percent to S$10.61 after
saying third-quarter net income tumbled 53 percent to S$135
million ($108 million). That compares with the S$162 million
average of three analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 9.4 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with increases of 5.4 percent by the
 S&P 500  and 6.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark were valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 in the U.S. and 1.5
times for the Europe Stoxx 600.  Hynix, Sony  Hynix Semiconductor sank 3.7 percent to 26,300 won in Seoul
after reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of 239.9 billion won
($214.8 million), exceeding the average 161.7 billion won loss
estimate by 25 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., the world’s largest
shipbuilder, plunged 7.7 percent to 293,000 won after saying
fourth-quarter operating profit slumped 62 percent.  Among stocks that advanced,  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest
consumer electronics maker, surged 8.1 percent to 1,435 yen in
Tokyo, after incoming Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  said
he will close down some underperforming businesses to help
revive the unprofitable company.  “The shares are rising on expectations that the company
will be on track for rebuilding,” Makoto Sengoku, a market
analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co., said by phone. “All the
bad factors have already been reflected.”  China Shipping Container Lines Co., part of the nation’s
second-largest shipping line, jumped 8.5 percent to HK$2.17 in
Hong Kong trading after telling investors it plans to raise
rates to boost revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
