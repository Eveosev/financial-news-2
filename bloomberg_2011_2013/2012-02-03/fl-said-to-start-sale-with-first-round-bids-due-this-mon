TFL Holding GmbH’s creditors have set
a Feb. 24 deadline for initial bids for the German leather-
chemicals supplier, two people familiar with the situation said.  A wide range of potential buyers have expressed interest in
the Weil am Rhein, Germany-based company, said one of the
people, who declined to be identified as the information is
private. Creditors are seeking a buyer for the whole business,
rather than breaking up TFL, the person said. TFL may be valued
at as much as 200 million euros ($263 million).  Efforts to consolidate among European suppliers of leather
chemicals have been hampered by low valuations.  BASF SE (BAS) 
abandoned the sale of its leather and textile unit in March
after offers fell short of the company’s valuation. Competition
from low-cost producers in  Asia  is coinciding with a slowdown in
demand in some markets for leather bags and shoes.  TFL, which stands for Together For Leather, is being sold
on behalf of creditors seeking debt repayments taken on under
the ownership of private equity firm Odewald & Cie. Andreas
Ziegenhagen, the trustee overseeing the sale, hired adviser
Leonardo & Co. last year to find a buyer for the company, three
people said in December.  Other leather-chemical makers in  Europe  include  Clariant
AG (CLN) ,  Lanxess AG (LXS)  and Stahl, owned by French buyout firm Wendel SA.  Odewald bought TFL, which had annual sales of about 240
million euros, from Permira Advisers LLP in 2003 for an
undisclosed price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
