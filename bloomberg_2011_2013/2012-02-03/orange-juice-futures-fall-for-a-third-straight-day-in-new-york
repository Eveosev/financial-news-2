Orange juice  for March delivery fell
0.4 percent to $2.0325 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York 
by 8:04 a.m., declining for a third straight day.  Some samples of U.S. orange juice tested positive for a
banned fungicide although levels were so low they’re not a
public health concern, the Food and Drug Administration said
yesterday.  Nine of 14 samples of domestic orange juice the agency
tested contained the compound carbendazim in concentrations of
less than 80 parts per billion, a safety benchmark set by the
Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency is holding and testing imported orange juice
after low levels of carbendazim was detected in juice from
Brazil. The compound, widely used in agriculture, is banned in
U.S. oranges.  The agency said it will conduct follow-up testing although
it “does not believe there is a need to continue” screening
for the fungicide in orange juice already in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
