Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA)  rose in Milan after
Finsoe, the biggest shareholder in  Unipol Gruppo Finanziario
SpA (UNI) , said it can invest as much as 500 million euros ($660
million) in the planned merger of the two insurers.  Finsoe will “directly invest” 350 million euros in the
capital increase that Unipol plans to finance the transaction,
la Repubblica reported, citing an interview with Finsoe’s
Chairman Marco Pedroni.  Fondiaria, based in Turin, climbed as much as 17 percent to
1.03 euros before being temporarily halted, giving the company a
market value of 451 million euros. Its unit  Milano Assicurazioni
SpA (MI)  increased 8 percent to 28 cents. Unipol rose 11 percent to
22.7 cents.  Unipol agreed last week to buy new shares in  Premafin
Finanziaria SpA (PF) , the controlling investor of Fondiaria, becoming
its main shareholder. The purchase will allow Premafin to
participate in a 1.1 billion-euro share sale announced by
Fondiaria on Jan. 30. After the recapitalization, all four of
the companies will merge to become Italy’s second-biggest
insurer after Assicurazioni Generali SpA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
