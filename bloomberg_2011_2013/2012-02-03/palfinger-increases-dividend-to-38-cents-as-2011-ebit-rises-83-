Palfinger AG (PAL)  climbed the most since
November after the world’s biggest maker of truck-mounted cranes
said it’s proposing to increase its dividend to 0.38 euros and
profit rose 83 percent last year.  Shares  rose   7.8 percent to 18.55 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Vienna, the biggest increase since Nov. 25.
The stock has advanced 51 percent this year, giving Palfinger a
market value of about 663 million euros ($870 million).  Earnings before interest and taxes soared to 67.9 million
euros from 37.1 million euros a year earlier, the Salzburg,
Austria-based company said in a statement today. It was expected
to report a profit of 64.6 million euros, according to the
average  estimate  of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
increased 30 percent to 845.7 million euros, beating the average
estimate of 827.8 million euros.  “Against the backdrop of the uncertain development of the
economy and demand, the management expects a moderate increase
in revenue, especially coming from the areas outside  Europe , for
the 2012 financial year,” Palfinger said.  China Expansion  Palfinger hopes to make an announcement on a joint venture
with a Chinese crane makers in the “next few weeks,” Chief
Executive Officer Herbert Ortner said in Vienna today.  “I am confident that talks will be completed in the next
few weeks,” he said. “ China  hopefully will be our biggest
market within the next five or six years.”  Expanding in China, where Palfinger already has a plant in
Shenzhen, is the most important step for the company since its
1999 initial public offering, Ortner said, adding that the
company was in “advanced” talks with one or two large Chinese
building-equipment manufacturers. The probability of completing
a deal in the first half is “very big,” he said, declining to
identify potential partners.  Among China’s biggest construction equipment makers are
Guangxi Liugong Machinery Co.,  Lonking Holdings Ltd. (3339) ,  Sany Heavy
Industry Co. (600031) ,  Shantui Construction Machinery Co. (000680)  and Anhui Heli
Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Palfinger
competitor  Cargotec Oyj (CGCBV)  announced plans in July for a joint
venture with Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co. to manufacture
cargo cranes in China.  The initial joint venture shouldn’t cost more than “a few
hundred million euros,” which can be paid out of  cash flow  or
liquidity provided by banks, the chief said, adding that
Palfinger has approval for a share sale, should additional funds
be required later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
