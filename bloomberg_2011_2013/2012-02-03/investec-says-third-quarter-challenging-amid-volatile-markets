Investec Plc (INVP) , the owner of a bank and
money manager in  South Africa  and the U.K., said the third
quarter of its fiscal year was “challenging” due to market
volatility.  Operating profit before goodwill, acquired intangibles,
non-operating items and taxation and after non-controlling
interests declined by 5.6 percent in the nine months through
December compared with a year earlier, the Johannesburg- and
London-based company said in a statement today. Operating costs
increased 6.8 percent, it said.  “Against a backdrop of volatile markets and low levels of
activity, the third quarter of the group’s 2012 financial year
has proven to be challenging,” the company said in the
statement.  Investec agreed in September to buy London-based Evolution
Group Plc in a transaction valuing the British stockbroker at
233.2 million pounds ($371.8 million), as it sought to gain
access to Evolution’s wealth management unit. The unit, Williams
de Broe, saw its assets increase by 7 percent to 6.2 billion
pounds in the year through April. Total assets under management
excluding Evolution declined, Investec said today.  The  shares  fell 1 percent to 397.9 pence at 8:44 a.m. in
London trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
