Tudou Holdings Ltd. surged the most
ever in New York, driving an index of U.S.-traded Chinese stocks
to a seventh weekly gain, after the company announced an
improved video platform with Weibo, a Twitter-like service with
250 million users.  Online game developers  Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  and  Perfect World 
Co. also climbed as their high cash levels and cheapness
compared with U.S. peers spurred analysts to upgrade their
stock.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. advanced 0.8 percent to a five-month
high of 106.48 on Feb. 3, rising 2.3 percent in the week.  Shanghai-based Tudou has built an “enhanced” platform for
users of Sina Corp.’s Weibo short-message social network to
share their videos, the company said on Feb. 3. The improved
service, which ensures Weibo users automatically become
registered Tudou users, will boost traffic for China’s second-
largest video website, said Echo He, a senior analyst at Maxim
Group LLC in  New York .  The deal “is extremely positive for Tudou and could really
boost Tudou’s numbers,” said Kevin Pollack, a  fund manager  at
Paragon Capital LP in New York, which invests in U.S.-listed
Chinese stocks. “Investors are recognizing that there are some
very attractive opportunities in the online gaming companies
given their low valuation levels and sizable amounts of cash.”  After tumbling as much as 56 percent last year amid fraud
allegations against Chinese companies, game developers trade at
less than five times their estimated  cash flow  for 2012,
compared with 15.5 for Electronic Arts Inc., the second-largest
U.S. video-game publisher.  ETF at Six-Month High  American depositary receipts of Tudou surged 16 percent to
$16.26 on Feb. 3, the most since its initial public offering in
August, and were up 22 percent last week. Users of Sina’s Weibo
service post about 86 million messages per day on average, Tudou
said in a statement. Sina fell 0.4 percent to $75 in New York,
paring its weekly advance to 7.2 percent.  The iShares FTSE  China  25 Index Fund, the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 1.4 percent on Feb. 3
to a six-month high of $40.49. It advanced 2.2 percent last
week, extending a five-week rally.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent on Feb. 3 to
an eight-week high of 2,330.405, climbing for a third trading
week.  ADRs of Shanghai-based Shanda jumped 8.3 percent to $3.93
on Feb. 3, the biggest jump since Nov. 28. Shanda’s stock trades
at 4.5 times its estimated cash flow for 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, while the multiple is 3.4 for Perfect
World, a Beijing-based online game developer.  ‘Good Bargain’  Perfect World advanced 6.1 percent to $12.20, the highest
level since Nov. 18. Jialong Shi, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
CLSA, upgraded Perfect World to “outperform” from
“underperform,” while lowering its 12-month price target to
$12.50 from $13 on Feb. 3.  “These online gaming stocks are a good bargain for
investors and the rally will continue this year,” said Andy
Yeung, a New York-based analyst at Oppenheimer & Co Inc.  Changyou.com Ltd. (CYOU) , the online-game unit of Chinese Internet
portal operator  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , advanced 5.3 percent to $29.09,
the highest level since October. Changyou trades at 5.5 times
estimated cash flow for 2012.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 36 percent to $124.4 million,
according to the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg before Changyou.com reports results today. The company
is forecasting $123.5 million. Sohu.com is also due to report
fourth-quarter earnings today.  Expedia Link-up  China Southern Airlines Co Ltd.,  Asia ’s biggest air carrier
by passenger numbers, jumped 5 percent to $27.09, the biggest
one-day advance since Jan. 10, after entering into a partnership
with Expedia Inc. to offer tickets through the online travel
agency.  Expedia, based in Bellevue,  Washington , will offer China
Southern fares and inventory on its websites in  North America ,
 Europe  and Asia, the company said in a statement on Feb. 3. The
offerings will be also available on discount travel site Hotwire
Inc. and on China’s Elong Inc., whose biggest shareholder is
Expedia, according to the statement.  ADRs of China Southern, which each represent 50 common
shares in the Guangzhou-based company, traded 2.5 percent higher
than the company’s shares in  Hong Kong , which climbed 3 percent
to HK$4.10, the equivalent of 53 U.S. cents. The premium was the
biggest since Jan. 10.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 1.5 percent to
1,344.90 on Feb. 3, extending its best start to a year since
1989, after a report showed that the U.S. jobless rate fell to
8.3 percent, the lowest level in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
