Palfinger AG (PAL) , the world’s biggest
maker of truck-mounted cranes, hopes to make an announcement on
a joint venture with a Chinese crane makers in the “next
weeks.”  “I am confident that talks will be completed in the next
few weeks,” Chief Executive Officer Herbert Ortner said in
Vienna today. “China hopefully will be our biggest market
within the next five or six years.”  Expanding in China, where Palfinger already has a plant in
Shenzhen, is the most important step for the company since its
1999 initial public offering, Ortner said, adding that the
company was in “advanced” talks with one or two large Chinese
building-equipment manufacturers. The probability of completing
a deal in the first half is “very big,” he said, declining to
identify potential partners.  Among China’s biggest construction equipment makers are
 Guangxi Liugong Machinery (000528)  Co.,  Lonking Holdings Ltd. (3339) ,  Sany Heavy
Industry Co. (600031) ,  Shantui Construction Machinery Co. (000680)  and Anhui Heli
Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Palfinger
competitor  Cargotec Oyj (CGCBV)  announced plans in July for a joint
venture with Jiangsu Rainbow Heavy Industries Co. to manufacture
cargo cranes in China.  The initial joint venture shouldn’t cost more than “a few
hundred million euros,” which can be paid out of  cash flow  or
liquidity provided by banks, the chief said, adding that
Palfinger has approval for a share sale, should additional funds
be required later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
