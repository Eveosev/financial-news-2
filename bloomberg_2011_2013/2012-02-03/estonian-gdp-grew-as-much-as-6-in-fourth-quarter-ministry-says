Estonia’s economy probably expanded 5
percent to 6 percent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter,
the  Finance Ministry  said, citing slower electronics exports and
warmer weather.  The $19 billion economy probably “was little changed”
compared with the previous quarter on seasonally adjusted basis,
Madis Aben, an analyst with the ministry’s fiscal policy
department in the capital, Tallinn, said today in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg questions. The national statistics office
is due to release the data on Feb. 10.  “Developments are uneven sector by sector, and growth is
continuing in several sectors, but production volumes and
exports in the electronics sector have significantly declined
from the high levels a year ago,” Aben said. “The energy
sector was also negatively affected by electricity prices and”
higher temperatures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
