Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) ,  Finland ’s only oil
refiner, advanced the most in two months after increasing sales
volumes of renewable fuel.  Neste Oil rose as much as 6.4 percent for today’s best
performance among the 31 members of the  BBG European Energy
Index. (BEENRG)  The shares, which have gained 14 percent this year for a
market valuation of 2.4 billion euros ($3.2 billion), traded at
9.20 euros as of 1:40 p.m. in the Finnish capital.  The European Union has set a goal to get 10 percent of its
transport energy from biofuels, hydrogen and renewable power by
2020, in order to help cut the region’s emissions 20 percent
from 1990 levels. Global renewables consumption will rise 8.2
percent a year in the next 20 years, outpacing the annual 2.1
increase for natural gas, the fastest-growing  fossil fuel ,  BP
Plc (BP/)  estimated in its annual  outlook  on Jan. 18.  “Renewable fuel sales volume was encouraging,” Henri Parkkinen, an analyst at Pohjola Bank Oyj in Helsinki, said by
phone. “The company delivered what it promised in this area,
keeping a positive outlook and strengthening belief” in
renewable fuels.  Neste Oil’s fourth-quarter renewable diesel sales increased
by 55 percent compared with the previous quarter. The company
maintained its dividend at 35 euro cents a share for 2011, even
as it reported a quarterly loss of 23 million euros, compared
with the median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
for a profit of 19.3 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
