Ukraine will need to replant at least
half of its winter grains after frosts this week destroyed
plants, said Tetiana Adamenko, the head of the agro-meteorology
department at the national weather center.  Soil temperatures dropped to minus 20 degrees Celsius
(minus 4 Fahrenheit) for more than two days in the
Dnipropetrovsk region, where 44 percent of grains failed to
emerge in the autumn drought, Adamenko said in a phone interview
in the capital Kiev today.  “Where there was no snow, there will be no plants,”
Adamenko said, adding she’s concerned more than half of the
sprouted grains will need re-seeding.  Ukraine’s  Agriculture Ministry  estimated about 8.4 million
hectares (21 million acres) of winter grains, most of which was
wheat, was planted for the 2012 harvest. About 7 million
hectares had sprouted as of Jan. 26 and 1.9 million hectares had
plants in good condition.  The winter grain plants that sprouted were in a weak
condition after the worst autumn drought in at least 50 years,
Adamenko said.  The lowest temperature this winter has been minus 36
degrees Celsius in the Crimean Peninsula, she said. Winds
removed snow from many fields and made the protective cover
uneven in almost all of the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Odessa and
Mykolayiv regions and in a large part of Vinnytsya, according to
the meteorologist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
