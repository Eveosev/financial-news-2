Montenegro will invite bids for the
operator of its main Adriatic port in Bar by the end of June,
 Tanjug  newswire reported, citing Transportation Minister Andrija Lompar.  The government wants to sell its 54 percent stake in
 Kontejnerski Terminal i Generalni Tereti  and a group of minority
owners who hold 10 percent may also offer their shares in the
planned tender, the report said. There were no binding bids in
the previous attempt to sell it in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
