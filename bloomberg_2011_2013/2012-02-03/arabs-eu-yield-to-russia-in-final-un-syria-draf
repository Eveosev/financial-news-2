Arab and European Union negotiators
at the  United Nations  will put to a vote a draft Security
Council resolution backing an  Arab League  plan to “facilitate a
Syrian-led political transition,” a step down from a more
explicit call for President Bashar al-Assad to step down.  The final draft, obtained late yesterday by Bloomberg News,
“fully supports” the Arab League’s Jan. 22 decision “to
facilitate a Syrian-led political transition to a democratic,
plural political system.” It’s unclear if the latest change in
language, which adds “Syrian-led,” will be enough to placate
Russian concerns that the proposal still endorses regime change.  A previous draft had already stripped all references to
Assad delegating “full powers” to his deputy. The new draft
explicitly says “nothing in this resolution authorizes”
military action, addressing Russian concerns over last March’s
UN authorization of a no-fly zone over  Libya  that was
interpreted to justify NATO military strikes that helped bring
down Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
