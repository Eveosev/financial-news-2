Kazakhstan’s sovereign wellbeing fund
 Samruk-Kazyna (SKKZ)  said it will support  BTA Bank (BTAS) ’s proposed debt
restructuring and the situation at the lender will be
stabilized, according to Umirzak Shukeyev, who heads the fund.  The “financial condition” of the bank makes it “clear”
that “BTA needs the second debt restructuring,” Shukeyev told
reporters today in the capital, Astana. “We will discuss this
with creditors and first of all we should make the principal
decision about the necessity of this restructuring with them,”
he said. “Samruk-Kazyna is ready for injections into BTA, but
creditors must do it too.”  BTA Bank said Jan. 26 it will push ahead with debt
restructuring talks even after failing to gain sufficient votes
from holders of global depositary receipts to begin the process.
The lender missed a coupon payment at the start of January on
its July 2018 dollar bonds. It has pledged to exempt depositors
from restructuring.  “We must support the bank, which means opening new
deposits and accounts there,” Shukeyev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
