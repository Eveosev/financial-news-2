U.S.  Air Force  Secretary Michael Donley outlined plans to cut 286 aircraft and eliminate 9,900
positions over five years as part of the Pentagon’s  budget
reductions.   “The best choice and course of action for us is to become
smaller in order to project a high-quality and ready force that
will continue to modernize,” Donley said today at a Pentagon
news conference.  Providing highlights that will be followed with details
when President  Barack Obama  presents his fiscal 2013 budget on
Feb. 13, Donley said the Air Force will retire 123 fighters, 133
transport planes and 30 aircraft used for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance.  Cuts to personnel include 3,900 positions from active duty
forces, 5,100 from the Air National Guard, and 900 from the Air
Force Reserve.  The Air Force has a military force of 510,900, according to
the service’s fiscal 2012 budget.  While Donley didn’t say how much money is involved, an Air
Force document said the aircraft reduction would save $8.7
billion over five years.  As the Air Force slows procurement of  Lockheed Martin
Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the service’s plan calls for
upgrading 350 aging Lockheed F-16 fighters.  “There is increased risk” from the cuts, Donley said.
“This is manageable, provided there are no further
reductions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
