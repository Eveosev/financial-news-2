Asia ’s naphtha crack spread is set to
narrow for the first week in five, signaling reduced profit for
refiners. Hin Leong Trading Pte bought gasoil cargoes in
Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent-crude futures
dropped to $117.40 a metric ton at 3 p.m. Singapore time from
$115.91 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of refining profit from the
petrochemical feedstock, has narrowed 12 percent this week and
is poised for the first decline in five weeks.  Glencore International Plc sold open-specification  naphtha 
for a fourth day, based on a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window. The company
sold 25,000 tons for first-half April delivery to Cargill Inc.
at $980 a ton and a similar volume for the same period to Vitol
Group at $981 a ton. Mabanaft GmbH & Co sold 25,000 tons of
naphtha for second-half April delivery to Mercuria Energy Ltd.
at $974 a ton.  Trafigura Beheer BV, the biggest reported buyer of  92-RON 
gasoline in  Singapore  this month, purchased 50,000 barrels from
Gunvor Group Ltd. at $122.70 a barrel. Total SA sold two 50,000-
barrel cargoes to Gracewood International Ltd. at $122.70 a
barrel. The Paris-based refiner also sold 50,000 barrels of  95-
RON  grade to Gracewood at $124.90 a barrel.  BP Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline from
ConocoPhillips at $125.70 a barrel and purchased a similar-sized
cargo of 97-RON grade from PetroChina Co. at $128.20 a barrel,
the survey showed. The Chinese refiner also sold 50,000 barrels
of 97-RON to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at $128.10 a barrel.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 250,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur from BP at 25 cents a barrel over benchmark
quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. The cargo is for the
earliest loading period of Feb. 18 to Feb. 22. Hin Leong also
purchased 150,000 barrels from PetroChina Co. at a 40-cent
premium, for Feb. 22 to Feb. 26.  Shell sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil to Trafigura Beheer BV
at 30 cents a barrel over quotes for Feb. 18 to Feb. 22 loading,
the survey showed. The two companies made a similar transaction
yesterday.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 20 cents
to $18.14 a barrel at 2:39 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This  crack spread  is set
to widen for a second week.  Jet fuel was unchanged for a second day at 10 cents a
barrel below gasoil, PVM data showed. This  regrade  has been
negative since Jan. 16, indicating it is unprofitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Chevron Corp. bought 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  from
Morgan Stanley at 30 cents a barrel above quotes, the survey
showed. That’s the first premium reported since Nov. 3.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil fell 2 cents to $2.56 a barrel below Dubai crude
at 2:39 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM data. That’s the
biggest  discount  since Jan. 9, signaling losses for refiners
turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke  fuel oil to  380-centistoke 
grade dropped 50 cents to $9.50 a ton, the lowest since Nov. 9,
PVM said. This  viscosity spread  is set to narrow for a third
week, meaning bunker, or marine fuel, declined less than higher-
quality  fuel oil .  Refinery News  SK Innovation Co., which owns  South Korea ’s biggest oil
refiner, plans to shut two crude-distillation units at its Ulsan
plant for maintenance, according to a company statement. The
240,000-barrel-a-day No. 4 unit will close for 34 days from
March 20 and the 110,000-barrel-a-day No. 2 facility will be
idled for 30 days from Oct. 11.  Cosmo Oil Co. will begin taking safety inspections at its
No. 2 crude-distillation unit by the local authorities at its
Chiba refinery near  Tokyo , said spokesman Katsuhisa Maeda.  Tenders  Idemitsu Kosan Co. bought 35,000 tons of naphtha for
February loading from Bharat Petroleum Corp. at about $33 a ton
above Middle East prices, said two traders.  Bharat Petroleum  offered to sell 35,000 tons of naphtha for
March loading from Kochi, according to a tender document.  Ceylon Petroleum Corp. bought gasoil and jet fuel from
Daewoo Group for February delivery, said a company official.  Sri
Lanka ’s state-owned company paid $3.14 a barrel over Singapore
prices for gasoil and a $2.84 premium for jet fuel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
