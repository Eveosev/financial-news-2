Far East Global Group Ltd. (830)  almost
doubled in Hong Kong trading after  China State Construction
International Holdings Ltd. (3311)  offered to boost its stake to take
control of the Hong Kong-based curtain-wall systems maker.  Far East Global, which resumed trading today after being
suspended on Nov. 15, rose 92 percent, the largest gain since
the stock debuted in Hong Kong on Mar. 30, 2010, to HK$1.13 by
the close of trading on the city’s bourse.  China State Construction International, a Hong Kong-based
unit of the state-owned  China State Construction Engineering
Corporation Ltd. (601668) , plans to expand overseas as the nation’s
property market cools on government curbs.  Far East Global “will provide an international platform
which allows the company to seek investment opportunities
throughout the international markets,” China State Construction
International said in a statement posted to the  Hong Kong  stock
exchange yesterday.  The construction company is offering to buy 1.04 billion
new shares to boost its stake in Far East Global to 51 percent,
or 53 percent if all outstanding share options are not
exercised, according to the statement. It will pay HK$1.18 in
cash for each existing share, it said.  China State Construction International has no intention of
privatizing Far East Global and its shares will remain listed on
the Hong Kong stock exchange after the transaction, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
