Members of the  Genop  labor union,
which organizes workers at  Public Power Corp. SA (PPC) , Greeceâ€™s
dominant electricity producer, are blockading the offices of
energy regulator RAE, ekathimerini  reported  on its website.  The workers accuse RAE of allowing private electricity
providers Hellas Power SA and Energa SA to run up debts of 200
million euros ($264 million) with  Public Power  and Desmie, which
operates the Greek power grid, according to ekathimerini, the
English-language version of the Athens-based Kathimerini
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
