Hong Kong  will not loosen its
 property-market  policy curbs even as housing prices and
transactions decline, Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said.  “Currently, our measures, which aim to keep the home
market development stable and healthy, are effective,” Tsang
told reporters in Hong Kong  today . “We will continue the
existing measures.”  The city’s government is following China’s lead in trying
to rein in housing prices in Hong Kong, which had risen to a 14-
year high by the middle of last year. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said
this week that his government will maintain curbs on the
property market to bring values to a reasonable level.  In Hong Kong, rising borrowing costs, extra transaction
taxes and higher down-payment requirements imposed by the
government have damped demand.  The number of home sales in Hong Kong slumped 56 percent in
January from a year earlier to 3,507, the lowest level since
2008, Land Registry figures showed yesterday.  Home prices  slid 6
percent from their peak in June, according to Centaline Property
Agency, the city’s biggest closely held real-estate broker in
the city.  Tsang also warned of the effects in Hong Kong of the U.S.
pledge to maintain low  interest rates . Hong Kong’s rates track
the U.S.’s because of a currency peg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
