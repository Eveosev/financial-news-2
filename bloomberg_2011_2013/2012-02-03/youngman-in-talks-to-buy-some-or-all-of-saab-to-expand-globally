Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co.
is in talks to buy part or all of bankrupt  Saab Automobile  to
help build the Chinese automaker’s brand globally.  Youngman is still in the “early stages of discussions”
and hasn’t decide which assets to buy, Hu Ming, a spokesman for
the closely held Jinhua, China-based company said in an
interview today. Representatives from both companies met in
Beijing over the Lunar New Year period to speak further on the
acquisition, he said, declining to elaborate on the assets being
considered, or the value of the deal.  Saab, whose parent is Netherlands-based  Swedish Automobile (SWAN) ,
filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 19 after running out of cash.
Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd.,  India ’s biggest sport-utility vehicle
manufacturer, is interested in buying at least parts of the
Swedish automaker, two people familiar with the situation said
on Dec. 30.  Youngman accumulated cash during the 2008 recession, giving
the company the ability to make acquisitions now, Hu said. The
Chinese automaker has long-term plans to make its passenger-car
unit a “competitive global brand,” and buying Saab assets
would fit into that goal, he said.  A call to Saab’s press office today wasn’t immediately
answered.  --Liza Lin. Editors: Dave McCombs, Garry Smithi  To contact the reporter on this story:
