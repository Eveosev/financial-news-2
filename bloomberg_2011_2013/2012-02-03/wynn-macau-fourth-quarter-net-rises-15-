Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) ’s full-year profit
missed analysts’ estimates as the casino company benefited less
than its competitor Sands  China  Ltd. from surging gambling
revenue in the former Portuguese colony. The stock dropped.  Fourth-quarter net income gained 15 percent to $239.9
million from $208.8 million a year earlier,  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) ’s
Hong Kong-listed unit said in a statement to the local stock
exchange today. Based on numbers derived from the statement,
full-year profit was $759.8 million, lower than the average
estimate of $795.3 million from 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Wynn plans to build a casino in Cotai to fend off rising
competition in Macau, the only place in China where casinos are
legal, as  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  and other operators increase gaming
centers to tap surging numbers of Chinese gamblers. Sands China,
controlled by  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas Sands Corp., this week
posted annual profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  “Today’s numbers are in line with my expectations but I’m
worried about its future growth because there’s still no news on
when its Cotai project will be approved,” Lantis Li, a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Capital Securities Corp., said. “If they
don’t have a new facility, they may lose out to rivals like
Sands. They are under a big threat.”  Wynn Macau shares fell as much 5.6 percent to HK$19.64
before trading at HK$19.96 at 2:12 p.m in  Hong Kong . Sands China
was unchanged at HK$27.75 after earlier rising as much as 4.7
percent.  Wynn Macau  has gained 2.3 percent this year, less than
the 26.4 percent gain of Sands China.  Fourth-quarter sales rose to $995.5 million from $912.2
million a year earlier, Wynn Macau said. The company’s earnings
growth lagged behind that of Sands China, which this week
reported a 44 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit.  Cotai Project  Macau, which surpassed the  Las Vegas Strip  as the world’s
biggest casino revenue hub in 2006, saw total gambling revenue
climb 42 percent last year to 268 billion patacas ($33.6
billion), according to Macau’s Gaming Inspection & Coordination
Bureau.  Sands is developing casino resorts in Macau to add to the
Venetian, Four Seasons and Sands. The first phase of Sands Cotai
Central is on track to open in about eight weeks, the company
said yesterday.  Wynn Resorts said yesterday that work on the budget and
scope for a new project in Cotai is continuing. In September,
Wynn Macau agreed to pay the Macau government 1.55 billion
patacas ($194 million) as a premium for 51 acres of land in the
Chinese city. Wynn Macau may open a new casino by 2015 at the
earliest, Deutsche Bank said at the time.  Wynn Resorts, led by founder, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Steve Wynn , is embroiled in a legal dispute with board
member and former vice chairman Kazuo Okada over access to
spending records.  Wynn Resorts yesterday reported a 67 percent increase in
fourth-quarter profit. The stock closed 2.6 percent higher at
$120.78 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
