Orco Property Group SA (ORCO) , a developer
in central  Europe  overhauling its business and debt under a
court-approved plan, rose for an eighth day in Czech trading,
headed for its longest stretch of gains since October.  The stock jumped 10 percent to 115 koruna as of 3:38 p.m.
in Prague, making it the best performer in the  PX (PX)  equity gauge,
which added 0.3 percent. A close at that level would mark Orcoâ€™s
biggest one-day rally since September 2010. In Paris, its home
market, the  stock  surged 15 percent to 4.70 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
