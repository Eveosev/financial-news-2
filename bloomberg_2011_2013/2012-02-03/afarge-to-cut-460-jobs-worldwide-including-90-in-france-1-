Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement maker, will eliminate 460 jobs globally as it pushes
ahead with an overhaul.  Of the headcount reduction, the Paris-based company will
cut 90 jobs in France through a “voluntary redundancy” plan,
the company said in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont in November announced
a plan to save an extra 500 million euros ($658 million) in
expenses from 2012. He also said then that the company will
continue to sell assets after shedding more than 2 billion euros
of assets in 2011.  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service cut
Lafarge’s credit rating to below investment grade last year,
saying the company will have difficulty restoring profitability
because of rising raw-material prices, political turmoil in the
 Middle East  and a lingering construction slump in countries such
as the U.S., Spain and Greece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
