Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , an  oil
company  controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , jumped the most in
nearly six months, extending gains for a second consecutive
trading day after Wood & Co. recommended buying the stock.  NIS, the biggest company in the market, climbed 8.15
percent to 650 dinars at 12:11 p.m. in Belgrade, its biggest
one-day rally since August 10. It was the best performer in the
BELEX15 index of most actively traded assets, which added 3.60
percent to 530.74 points, outperforming other emerging markets
worldwide.  Wood initiated its coverage of NIS with a 12-month price
estimate of 972 dinars and recommended buying the stock, citing
“cheap” valuation relative to peers and growing output.  Growth on the BELEX15 was supported after Royal
FrieslandCampina said it would buy two Serbian dairies, majority
owned by Salford Capital Partners, bolstering optimism that
company valuations in merger and acquisition deals are much
better than their present market values, Nenad Gujanicic, head
broker at Belgrade-based Sinteza Invest Group AD said in a
telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
