An International Monetary Fund
mission to  Serbia  that is holding talks about the 2012 budget
will meet government officials on Feb. 6, the central bank said.  The mission will discuss the “macroeconomic framework for
2012” and the “compliance with performance criteria for
December 2011,” the Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said in
an e-mail today.  According to IMF  reports , benchmarks for end-December 2011
include a floor on net international reserves of the central
bank of 4.5 billion euros ($5.92 billion), a 153-billion-dinar
($1.89 billion) ceiling on consolidated general government
overall gap and a 1.95 billion-euro cap on new foreign, non-
concessional, direct or sovereign-backed borrowing by the public
sector for 2011.  The lender’s mission will especially focus on the
“implementation of agreed fiscal policy measures and compliance
with set fiscal rules,” the National Bank of Serbia added.
Under the rules, Serbia needs to keep its public debt below 45
percent of gross domestic product. The ratio stood at 44.8
percent in November.  The  Finance Ministry  was due to report December budget
figures by mid-January. The January-November budget gap reached
119.97 billion dinars and compared with a 142.7 billion-dinar
cap set in a revised 2011 budget. The full-year gap would equal
4.5 percent of Serbia’s gross domestic product.  The IMF postponed the first review of its $1.3 billion
precautionary-loan program with Serbia on Jan. 20 because of the
budget, which it said “deviates from the program parameters”
and especially “issuance of public debt and guarantees.” It
estimated the “deviation” at around 1 percent of GDP, or at
least 300 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
