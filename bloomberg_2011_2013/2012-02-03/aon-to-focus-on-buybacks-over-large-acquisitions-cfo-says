Aon Corp. (AON) , the world’s largest
insurance brokerage, said it plans to focus on stock buybacks as
it seeks to boost shareholder returns, Chief Financial Officer
Christa Davies said.  “We do not believe there’s a significant acquisition on
the horizon,” she said today on a conference call with analysts
to discuss the Chicago-based broker’s fourth-quarter results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
