Crude oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures advanced for the first time since Jan. 26
after the U.S. jobless rate dropped to a three-year low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.6 as of 2:30 p.m. in  New York , down
from 28.5 yesterday.  “It’s definitely down on the day because we’re higher
today and back in the range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York  Crude for March delivery rose 1.24 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to $97.60 a barrel at 2:10 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $95.44 yesterday, the lowest intraday
price since Dec. 20. Since then, the front-month contract has
traded in a range of about $9, between a low of $94.14 and a
high of $103.74.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $90 puts, with 4,200 lots changing hands at 2:19 p.m. They
fell 19 cents to 20 cents a barrel. April $85 puts, the second-
most active options, lost 23 cents to 56 cents with 2,708 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume
and were four of the five most-active contracts.  “We saw some trading in April and June $85 puts, some
pretty decent buying in April $130 calls, some selling in the
April $115 calls,” Rigolini said. “In June $110 calls, we saw
both buying and selling.”  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 52 percent of volume in the
previous session. March $90 puts were the most actively traded,
with 8,684 lots changing hands as they rose 9 cents to 39 cents
a barrel. The next-most active options, March $85 puts, gained 1
cent to 10 cents on volume of 6,516 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,193
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 37,258 lots and
December $100 calls with 33,825.  To contact the reporter on this story:
