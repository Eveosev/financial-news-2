Exports of North Sea Forties crude
for March will increase by one lot from this month to 24
cargoes, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments will total 14.4 million barrels, or 464,516
barrels a day, compared with 475,862 barrels a day in February,
which has fewer days, according to the plan.  Forties is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up
the Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East , Africa and  Russia . The other blends are Ekofisk,
Brent and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
