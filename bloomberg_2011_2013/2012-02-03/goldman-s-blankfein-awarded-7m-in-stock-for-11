Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, gave Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  a $7 million restricted-stock bonus for
2011, a decrease from $12.6 million a year earlier.  Blankfein, 57, received 61,702 shares on Feb. 1, according
to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The stock closed at $113.45 in  New York  that day. Goldman Sachs
raised Blankfein’s salary to $2 million last year from $600,000.  Goldman Sachs’s 2011  earnings  dropped 47 percent to the
lowest level since 2008 on a second consecutive annual decline
in fixed-income trading revenue. The New York-based firm reduced
compensation 21 percent and eliminated 2,400 jobs. The stock
fell  46 percent  in 2011, more than the 18 percent drop in the
S&P 500 Financials Index.  Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, President  Gary Cohn ,
and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans and John S. Weinberg each
also received 61,702 restricted shares, according to separate
filings issued yesterday. Base salaries for those four
executives jumped last year to $1.85 million each from $600,000.  The filings don’t include how much any of the executives
have been awarded in cash bonuses. Blankfein received a $5.4
million cash bonus for 2010, his first since getting about $27
million in cash bonuses for each of 2007 and 2006.  James A. Johnson, a former CEO of  Fannie Mae  and the
longest serving member of the Goldman Sachs board, is chairman
of the compensation committee. The company won approval from 73
percent of shareholders for its compensation plan at the last
annual meeting in May, down from 96 percent a year earlier.  JPMorgan’s Dimon  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  left Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s pay package for 2011 almost unchanged at about $23
million after trimming stock and options awards, according to a
person with knowledge of the decision.  JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank, paid
Dimon $17.3 million in restricted stock and options for 2011,
down from $17.4 million for 2010, including 337,032 restricted
shares valued at about $12.3 million, according to  regulatory
filings  on Jan. 19 by the New York-based company. The package
awarded 562,430 options valued by the firm at about $5 million,
according to the person, who asked for anonymity because
compensation matters are confidential.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, paid
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  $10.5 million
for 2011, a 25 percent decrease from the previous year, a person
familiar with the decision said on Jan. 19.  Gorman, 53, will get 277,768 restricted shares, valued at
$5.1 million at the Jan. 19 closing price of $18.39, according
to a filing with the SEC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
