Three Serbian businessmen may control
50 percent of JAT Airways after a planned workforce reduction in
the flag carrier in partnership with the state,  B92  broadcaster
reported, citing one of the possible investors.  Miroslav Miskovic, the president of  Delta Holding , Miodrag
Kostic of  MK Group,  and Farmakom MB owner Miroslav Bogicevic may
invest a combined 25 million euros ($33 million), while the
state may invest as much in the overhaul that would reduce the
workforce to a third of the 1,200 employees now and renew the
aging  fleet , the report said, quoting Kostic.  Serbiaâ€™s latest tender to sell the unprofitable airline
failed in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
