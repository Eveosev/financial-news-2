Argentina ’s  corn  crop this year will
be 22.5 million metric tons, trailing a U.S. government forecast
of 26 million, Informa Economics Inc. said today in a report to
clients. Last month, the researcher forecast a crop of 24
million, compared with 22.5 million harvested a year earlier.  Brazil’s  corn  harvest will be 61 million tons, unchanged
from a Jan. 6 estimate, and up from 57.5 million harvested in
2011, Memphis, Tennessee-based Informa said. The U.S. Department
of Agriculture last month predicted 61 million tons.  The USDA will update its forecasts on Feb. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
