Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) ,  China ’s second-
largest video website, jumped the most since its August initial
public offering in the U.S. after creating a platform for users
of a Twitter-like service to share videos online.  American depositary receipts of Tudou surged 28 percent to
$17.95 by 1:42 p.m. in New York, the highest intraday level
since September.  Shanghai-based Tudou has built an “enhanced” platform for
users of Sina Corp.’s Weibo service to share videos, according
to a statement released today. Weibo users automatically become
registered Tudou users and will be able to share their videos
with other subscribers to Tudou, the statement said.  Sina, an Internet media company also based in  Shanghai ,
holds a 9 percent stake in Tudou. Weibo had 250 million
registered users as of the end of September who post 86 million
messages per day on average, according to Tudou’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
