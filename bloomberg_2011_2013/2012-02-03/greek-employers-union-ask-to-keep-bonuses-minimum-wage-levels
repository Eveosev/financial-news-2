Greek employers and the country’s
biggest private sector union have called on Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  to resist pressure to cut the national  minimum wage 
and holiday allowances.  Three private sector employer groups and the union, GSEE,
sent Papademos a letter after meeting yesterday, according to a
copy of the letter e-mailed by GSEE. The European Union and
 International Monetary Fund  have demanded a reduction in the
minimum wage and bonuses paid at Christmas and Easter to lower
labor costs and improve competitiveness.  “Competitiveness at the national level is influenced far
more by other factors than wage costs, such as bureaucracy bred
by over-regulation, state intervention, taxation, corruption and
an anti-business attitude,” the letter said, adding that the
private sector wage bill fell by 14.3 percent in 2010 and 2011.  The letter was also sent to the leaders of the three
political parties supporting Papademos’s interim government.
 Greece  and an EU/IMF mission are trying to finalize conditions
attached to a 130 billion-euro ($171 billion) financing package
agreed on Oct. 26.  Talks with the EU and IMF officials are “in the final
phase,” government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said in an
interview with Real FM radio today, according to an e-mailed
transcript from his office.  GSEE opposed a proposal by the National Confederation of
Commerce, the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises and the GSEVEE
federation representing small businesses, to freeze private
sector wages over the next two years, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
