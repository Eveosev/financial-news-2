Overseas  investors  bought a net  21.3
billion rupees  ($434.6 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
the biggest one-day purchase in more than three months.  Foreigners bought 51.2 billion rupees of shares and sold
29.9 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. The inflow is the most since Oct. 28
when funds invested a net 23.6 billion rupees, the  data  show.
They bought a net 4.5 million rupees of bonds yesterday.  Offshore funds have bought 152.3 billion rupees of stocks
and 165.6 billion rupees of bonds this year after the  Reserve
Bank  of India eased monetary policy, inflation slowed and
earnings of some companies beat forecasts. The flows helped the
benchmark  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  post its best January gain
since 1994 and fueled a record monthly advance in the rupee.
They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds last year.  Foreigners have invested 4.596 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.373 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. Investments in debt increased after Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government raised the cap on foreign
ownership of local currency bonds by 20 percent to $60 billion
in November to stem a slide in the rupee. The currency tumbled
16 percent in 2011,  Asia ’s worst performer.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market, Asia’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows surged to a record
in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the world’s
top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
