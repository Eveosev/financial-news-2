Hong Kong stocks rose for the fifth
week, the longest streak since October 2010, with the  Hang Seng
Index (HSI)  closing at a six-month high, on speculation China may take
more measures to boost economic growth.  Banks advanced, led by China Minsheng Banking Corp., the
nation’s first non-state lender, which rose 1.4 percent.
 Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka- shing, gained 3.3 percent after it agreed to buy a mobile-phone
operator in Europe.  Sinopharm Group Co. (1099) , China’ largest drug
distributor, surged 12 percent after China’s Ministry of Health
said it will increase the subsidy for medical insurance.  “Though China’s growth is slowing, it won’t be a hard
landing,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River
Fund Management Co. “ Monetary policy  is starting to ease and
the market’s expectations of a reserve-requirement cut are
rising. Stocks are also really cheap now.”  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent, to 20,756.98 at the
close. The gauge advanced 1.3 percent this week, its fifth
straight week of gain, as manufacturing in China, the U.S. and
Europe increased. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
mainland companies listed in the city gained 0.2 percent to
11,605.57 today.  Stocks climbed on speculation slowing economic growth will
push the Chinese central bank to relax monetary policies. The
measure trades at 10.5 times estimated earnings, from a low of
7.7 times on Oct. 24, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Banks Rally  China Minsheng rallied 1.4 percent to HK$7.52.  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the nation’s No. 2 lender by market
value, rose 0.8 percent to HK$6.39. Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd., the nation’s third-biggest lender by market value, gained
0.5 percent to HK$3.92.  Hutchison Whampoa advanced after agreeing to buy Orange

carrier at 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion). Hutchison rose 3.3
percent to HK$76.40.  Sinopharm rose 12 percent to HK$20.55 on the plan, which
will raise subsidies to about 300 yuan ($47.60) per capita in
rural China this year. That’s more than the expected 240 yuan,
CIC analyst Jessica Li said by phone today.  Wynn Macau Ltd., the Hong Kong-listed casino unit of  Wynn
Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) , slipped 2.4 percent to HK$20.30 percent after
posting profit that missed estimates. Shares dropped after the
