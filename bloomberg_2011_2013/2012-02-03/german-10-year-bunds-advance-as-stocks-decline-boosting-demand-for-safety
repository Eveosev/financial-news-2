Italian and Spanish government bonds
fell as  Greece  struggled to reach accords with European
officials and its creditors to avoid a default next month,
sapping demand for the region’s higher-yielding assets.  German bonds fell, posting a weekly decline, as U.S.
employment climbed more than economists forecast in January and
the jobless rate slipped to the lowest in three years. Italian
10-year yields rose from the least since October after a report
showed the country’s services sector contracted more than
estimated. The French-German  10-year yield difference  dropped
below 100 basis points for the first time in almost two months.  “There’s an element of caution out here with regards to
Greece,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in  London . “The Italian data was very
poor and the underlying picture is that the non-core economies
are in a pretty dire state.”  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 5.70 percent at 4:35 p.m. London time,
after falling to 5.54 percent, the lowest since Oct. 10. The 5
percent security due March 2022 dropped 0.665, or 6.65 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,311) face amount, to 95.305.  Spain ’s 10-year
yield rose six basis points to 4.99 percent.  Greece is trying to forge on a rescue plan that will
include a loss of more than 70 percent for bondholders in a
voluntary debt exchange and loans that may exceed the 130
billion euros now on the table. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
said the country is in the final stretch of negotiations for a
second program that will place the economy on a sounder footing.  Greek Notes  The country’s notes due August 2013 yielded 190.37 percent,
from 179.20 percent yesterday and 171.28 percent a week ago.
That left the price at 20.75 percent of face value. Rates on the
bond maturing in October 2022 fell 18 basis points to 34.19
percent.  An index based on a survey of Italian  purchasing managers 
in services was at 44.8 in January from 44.5 in December, Markit
Economics said in a report today. Analysts estimated it would
rise to 45.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed nine basis points to 1.94
percent, after falling to 1.82 percent. That left the yield
eight basis points higher since Jan. 27. French 10-year yields
were little changed at 2.90 percent.  The spread between the securities narrowed nine basis
points to 97 basis points, the first time it has dropped below
100 basis points since Dec. 6. France’s 10-year yield slipped 13
basis points yesterday as borrowing costs declined at a sale of
benchmark 10-year debt.  French Sale  The nation sold 5.698 billion euros of bonds at an average
yield of 3.13 percent, compared with 3.29 percent at the
previous auction on Jan. 5.  “The auctions this week helped to bolster confidence and
there’s a lot of interest in French bonds,” said  Orlando Green ,
a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate and
Investment Bank in London.  French bonds have handed investors a return of 1.4 percent
this year, after gaining 4.5 percent in 2011, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian government debt securities
have made 8.1 percent this year, while their Spanish
counterparts earned 2.7 percent.  Services, Manufacturing  Spanish and Italian bonds have rallied since the  European
Central Bank  offered unlimited three-year cash to the region’s
financial institutions in December to avoid a credit crunch. The
securities have advanced amid speculation banks are buying them
to use as collateral with the ECB under the program, known as
the longer-term refinancing operation. The central bank will
offer another set of the loans this month.  Bunds also fell as data showed Germany and  France  led
growth in European services and factory output, fueling optimism
the bigger economies can withstand the debt crisis.  A euro-area  composite index  based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries rose to 50.4 from 48.3 in December,
London-based Markit Economics said in a report today. January’s
reading is unchanged from an initial estimate on Jan. 24. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  The 243,000 increase in American payrolls was the most
since April and exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey,
Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The  unemployment
rate  dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since February 2009.  Volatility on Portuguese debt was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by  Finland , according to measures of 10-
year bonds, two- and 10-year spreads and credit-default swaps.
The yield on  Portugal ’s securities due April 2021 dropped for a
fourth day, declining by 94 basis points to 13.87 percent.
Finland’s 10-year yield rose nine basis points to 2.37 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
