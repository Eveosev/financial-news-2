The Federal Communications Commission
ruled it was reasonable for a television station to refuse to
sell air time during the Feb. 5 Super Bowl to an anti-abortion
activist who says he is a Democratic candidate for president.  Randall Terry, whose website touts ads that show aborted
babies, wouldn’t have guaranteed access to Super Bowl air time
“even if Terry were a legally qualified candidate,” the FCC
said in an order today as it ruled on behalf of WMAQ, a Chicago
station owned by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal .  The Democratic National Committee in a letter said Terry
wasn’t a candidate, according to the FCC’s order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
