University of Connecticut  men’s
basketball coach  Jim Calhoun  is taking an indefinite leave for
treatment of a lower-back ailment, the school’s athletic
department said on its Facebook page.  Calhoun, 69, won’t coach at least the team’s next two games
as he receives daily treatment for spinal stenosis, which is
causing “severe pain” and limited mobility, according to the
statement. Assistant  George Blaney , in his 11th season with the
team, will take over head coaching duties in Calhoun’s absence.  Calhoun led UConn to last season’s  National Collegiate
Athletic Association  championship, his third in 26 years at the
Storrs, Connecticut-based university. His 869 wins rank third
among active coaches in college basketball’s top level, trailing
fellow Basketball Hall of Fame members  Mike Krzyzewski  (919) of
Duke and Jim Boeheim (878) of Syracuse.  The national championship run came in the midst of an NCAA
investigation into the Huskies’ program. On Feb. 22, Calhoun was
suspended by the NCAA for the first three  Big East  conference
games of this season for failing to monitor recruiting
violations that included more than $6,000 in improper benefits
to a former player.  In January 2010, Calhoun took a seven-game leave for an
undisclosed illness. At that time, the school said the condition
was unrelated to his history of prostate cancer, which required
surgery in 2003.  The Huskies are 14-7, 4-5 in the Big East. The team plays
tomorrow at home against  Seton Hall  (15-7, 4-6), and on Feb. 6
at Louisville (17-5, 5-4).  To contact the reporter on this story:
