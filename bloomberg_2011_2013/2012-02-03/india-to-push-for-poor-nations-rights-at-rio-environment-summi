India  vowed to press richer nations
to shoulder the burden of protecting the environment at a 
meeting in Brazil, where leaders are due to gather in June for 
the 20-year anniversary of an historic development summit.  India has battled efforts by the U.S. and Europe to impose
legally binding emission-reduction targets on fast-growing
polluters like itself and China, arguing they shouldn’t be
subject to the same measures as developed nations historically
responsible for the problem.  Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said India will
extend that position to environmental negotiations, including
 Rio de Janeiro  at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
Development, known as Rio+20 in policy circles.  “Whether it’s  climate change , whether it’s Rio+20, whether
it’s biodiversity, at the bottom line there should be equity,”
Natarajan told a conference in  New Delhi  today. She said that
means “common but differentiated responsibilities, and that
there should be an equity in all the decisions we make.”  The first Rio conference in 1992, known as the Earth
Summit, drew  108 heads of state  and set up the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change to stabilize the rise of greenhouse
gas emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
