Acme Packet Inc. (APKT)  fell the most in a
month after the maker of computer-networking technology reported
fourth-quarter sales and profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Acme dropped 6.5 percent to $28.88 at 9:31 a.m. after the
Bedford, Massachusetts-based company said yesterday that profit
excluding certain items was 26 cents a share, missing the
average estimate of 28 cents in a Bloomberg survey. Earlier the
shares dropped 7.6 percent for the biggest intraday decline
since Jan. 4.  Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ory said slower spending by
telecommunications-service providers in North America hurt
results. He doesn’t expect expenditures by those companies to
improve in the first half of 2012.  “The majority of that business tends to come in the back
half of the year, so we really were disappointed,” Ory said on
a conference call with analysts.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 40 percent to $8.7 million,
or 12 cents a share, from $14.5 million, or 21 cents, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement. Revenue rose 18
percent to $83 million, compared with a projection of $85.7
million.  Ory’s remarks echoed those made by  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR) 
CEO  Kevin Johnson  on Jan. 26. The head of the No. 2 maker of
networking equipment said  Internet providers  in the U.S. are
delaying upgrades, contributing to a lower-than-expected
forecast.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the biggest maker of networking
equipment, is scheduled to report its results Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
