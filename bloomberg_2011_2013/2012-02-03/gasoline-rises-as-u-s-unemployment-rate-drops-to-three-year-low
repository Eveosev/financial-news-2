Gasoline rose as the U.S. added more
workers than expected in January, sending the jobless rate down
to the lowest level in almost three years and boosting
speculation that fuel demand will improve.  Futures advanced as much as 2 percent after Labor
Department figures showed the 243,000 increase in payrolls was
the most since April and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey. The  unemployment rate  dropped to 8.3 percent, the
lowest since February 2009.  “It is a positive sign for the economy,” said Jacob
Correll, a commodity analyst at Summit Energy Inc. in
Louisville,  Kentucky . “There are a lot of indications that we
might be recovering slightly more quickly than anticipated,
that’s the reason we are seeing the gasoline bounce.”  Gasoline for March delivery rose 5.16 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.9205 at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices touched $2.9259.  March-delivery heating oil gained 4.86 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.1015 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 1.2
cents to $3.467 yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices were 11
percent above a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
