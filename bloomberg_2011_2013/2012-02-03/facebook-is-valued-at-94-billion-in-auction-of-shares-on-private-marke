Facebook Inc. (FB) , the social-networking
company that’s preparing for an initial public offering, had a
valuation of at least $94 billion yesterday in an auction of its
shares on the private market.  SharesPost Inc.  completed an auction of 100,000 shares of
Facebook’s Class B common stock, according to an e-mail obtained
by Bloomberg News. The shares were sold for a clearing price of
$40 each, valuing the company at $94 billion based on a fully
diluted share count of about 2.35 billion, according to
SharesPost.  Facebook filed this week to raise at least $5 billion in
the largest Internet IPO on record. The  Menlo Park , California-
based company, with 845 million users worldwide, is considering
a valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion, people with
knowledge of the matter said last week. At the top of the range,
 Facebook  would be the ninth-biggest U.S.  technology company  by
market value.  A $100 billion market capitalization would value Facebook
at 26.9 times trailing 12-month sales, more than double Google
Inc.’s valuation when the search-engine operator went public in
2004. Revenue at Facebook jumped 88 percent last year to $3.71
billion, while net income climbed by almost two-thirds to $1
billion.  The valuation based on a per-share price of $40 may change
depending on the actual share count after the IPO. As of Dec.
31, Facebook had 117.1 million Class A shares and 1.76 billion
Class B shares outstanding. Additionally, there are about 380
million restricted stock units that vest at a later date, as
well as other shares tied to options and compensation.  Jeremiah Hall, a spokesman for San Bruno, California-based
SharesPost, confirmed the auction. Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman
for Facebook, declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
