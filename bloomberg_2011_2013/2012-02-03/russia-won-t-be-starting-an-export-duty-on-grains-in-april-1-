Russia won’t be starting an export
duty on grains in April, First Deputy Prime Minister  Viktor
Zubkov  said.  Russia’s grain crop will be 93.9 million metric tons, with
27 million tons of exports in the 2011-12 marketing year, Zubkov
said in a statement on the government’s website.  “Russia’s government doesn’t see grounds for any kind of
grain export restriction in April this year,” Zubkov said,
according to the statement.  Wheat capped the longest rally in almost four weeks last
month on speculation that Russia would limit exports with a
duty. Shipments so far this season are 19.6 million tons,
according to today’s statement.  “It is good for exporters because they were afraid of
signing contracts with deliveries in April,” Andrei Sizov Jr.,
managing director of SovEcon, a research company, said by phone
from Moscow. “ Russia  will be now actively present at tenders
with grain deliveries for April.”  Wheat for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to $6.58 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:42 p.m. London time. Prices
have dropped 23 percent in the past year as Russia boosted
export supplies.  Russia probably won’t have a duty at all this season, Sizov
said. Snow cover in Russia’s southern regions means there are no
“serious” losses expected for the winter crops, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
