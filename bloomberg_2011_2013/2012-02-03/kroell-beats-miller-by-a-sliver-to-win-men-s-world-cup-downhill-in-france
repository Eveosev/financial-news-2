Klaus Kroell beat Bode Miller of the
U.S. by 0.01 of a second to give Austria its first  World Cup 
downhill victory of the season.  Kroell posted a time of 2 minutes, 04.22 seconds in
Chamonix, France. Switzerland’s Didier Cuche, who’d won the past
two downhills, was third as the top five finishers were
separated by just 0.08 seconds.  “It was so, so tight in the finish,” Kroell on the World
Cup website. “In the end, I was the lucky one.”  It was Kroell’s fourth career victory and first since the
downhill in Wengen, Switzerland, in January of last year. It
moved him into second place in the downhill season standings, 40
points behind Cuche.  The race was the first of two downhills scheduled for
Chamonix this weekend and replaced the race canceled in Val
Gardena-Groeden,  Italy , in December. The regularly-scheduled
downhill is tomorrow, followed by a super-combined race in two
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
