U.S. stocks rose, giving the  Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index  a fifth straight weekly advance, after
reports showed employment in the world’s largest economy topped
forecasts and global manufacturing is strengthening.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  American Express (AXP)  Co. jumped at
least 4.8 percent this week,  leading gains  in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU) , which climbed to its highest level since May
2008. Financial and technology companies added at least 3.1
percent as a group, posting the biggest advances out of 10
industries in the S&P 500. Whirlpool Corp. surged 26 percent
after forecasting profit that beat analysts’ estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 2.2 percent to 1,344.90 since Jan. 27,
completing the longest weekly rally since January 2011. It is up
6.9 percent this year, the best annual start since 1987. The Dow
added 201.77 points, or 1.6 percent, to 12,862.23 this week.  “We’re in a positive feedback loop,” Bernard Schoenfeld,
the New York-based senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon
Wealth Management, which oversees about $168 billion, said in a
telephone interview. “The employment picture is improving,” he
said. “We’re seeing earnings growth continue to be favorable,
valuations are attractive, and the economy seems to be
improving.”  The  S&P 500  has recovered after the European debt crisis
drove the index down 19 percent between April 29 and Oct. 3,
boosted by better-than-estimated economic data and corporate
profits. It’s 1.4 percent away from surpassing its peak nine
months ago and reaching the highest since June 2008. This week’s
advance was propelled by the American  unemployment rate  dropping
to a three-year low and manufacturing gauges in the U.S.,  China 
and  Europe  increasing.  Jobless Rate, Factories  Stocks gained yesterday after Labor Department figures
showed payrolls increased by 243,000 in January, the most since
April and exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
The median economist projection in the survey called for an
increase of 140,000. The  unemployment rate  dropped to 8.3
percent, the lowest since February 2009.  The S&P 500 increased three straight days to end the week,
breaking a four-day losing streak. Equities rallied on Feb. 1
after data showing manufacturing in the U.S. grew at the fastest
pace since June. The U.K.’s factory measure unexpectedly reached
an eight-month high. The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities  has
climbed  22 percent from its 2011 low of 1,099.23.  ‘Stars Are Aligning’  “The stars are aligning to push the market higher,” Brian Jacobsen, who helps oversee about $209 billion as chief
portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in  Menomonee
Falls ,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. The jobs data
“was a very encouraging report. It should silence a lot of the
skeptics out there who are saying that Europe is going to push
the U.S. into a recession.”  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  rallied to its highest
level since July 28, rising 3.5 percent.  Financial companies in the S&P 500 climbed 4.2 percent as a
group, the largest gain among 10 industries. Bank of America,
the second-largest  U.S. bank  by assets, advanced 7.5 percent to
$7.84, while American Express, the biggest credit-card issuer by
purchases, added 4.8 percent to $52.25.  Technology companies increased 3.1 percent, the second-
biggest increase in the benchmark measure. Facebook Inc. filed
to raise $5 billion in the largest Internet initial public
offering on record. Zynga Inc., the largest developer of games
for the company, surged 33 percent to $13.39. Groupon Inc.
rallied 22 percent to $24.43.  Whirlpool, Marathon  Whirlpool (WHR)  rallied 26 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$68.66. The world’s largest appliance maker forecast that it
would earn at least $6.50 a share from continuing operations in
2012, compared with the $5.80 average of analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  jumped 17 percent, the second-
biggest gain in the S&P 500, to $43.98. The crude refiner that
was spun off from Marathon Oil Corp. in June, will consider an
initial public offering for its pipeline assets that may be
worth as much as $6.2 billion. The company also said it will buy
back as much as $2 billion in shares.  Genworth Financial Inc. rose 17 percent to $9.17. The
mortgage guarantor and life insurer swung to a fourth-quarter
 profit (GNW)  on fewer claims tied to delinquent borrowers. Profit in
the three months ended Dec. 31 was 22 cents a share, compared
with a loss of 33 cents a year earlier. The company, which
dropped by half last year, has gained 40 percent since Dec. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
