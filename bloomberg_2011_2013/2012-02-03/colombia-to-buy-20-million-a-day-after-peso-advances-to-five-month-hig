Colombia ’s central bank said it will
start a three-month program of dollar purchases after the peso
strengthened to a five-month high today.  Banco de la Republica will buy $20 million a day in
auctions for three months starting from Feb. 6 to boost the
Andean nation’s levels of international reserves, according to a
statement published today on its website.  The peso appreciated 0.5 percent to 1,784.50 per  U.S.
dollar , marking a fifth straight week of gains. It has advanced
8.6 percent this year.  The central bank ended a year-long daily dollar purchase
program on Sept. 30 after European debt turmoil led investors to
dump emerging-market assets.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.36 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
fell 0.223 centavo to 120.9920 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
