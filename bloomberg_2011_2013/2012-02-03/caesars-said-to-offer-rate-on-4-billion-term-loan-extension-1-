Caesars Entertainment Corp. (HET)  proposed
 interest rates  it will pay on as much as $4 billion of term
loans for which the hotel and casino operator is asking lenders
to extend the maturity date, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.  The extended debt will pay 4.5 percentage points to 4.75
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private.  Caesars will pay 4.5 percentage points more than Libor if
$3.25 billion or less of the loans are extended and a 4.75
percentage-point margin if maturities on more than $3.25 billion
are pushed out, the person said. The Las Vegas-based company
said yesterday that it’s seeking to extend the maturity on as
much as $4 billion of term loans to January 2018 from January
2015 and boost the interest rate on that portion.  The company’s existing B1, B2 and B3 term loans pay 3
percentage points more than Libor with no minimum on the
benchmark, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenders are being offered a 10 basis-point amendment fee as
well as a 15 basis-point fee if they agree to the extension, the
person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Caesars also is seeking to extend the maturity on a $1.2
billion revolving line of credit to January 2017 from January
2014, the person said.  Revolver Rate  The extended revolver will pay 4.5 percentage points to
4.75 percentage points more than Libor with lenders being
offered a 100 basis-point fee on the unused portion of the
revolver. The existing revolving facility pays 3 percentage
points more than Libor with a 50 basis-point unused fee,
Bloomberg data show. Libor is the rate banks say they can borrow
in dollars from each other.  Caesars isn’t offering lenders on its B4 term loan an
opportunity to extend, the person said. That portion is due in
October 2016 and pays interest at 7.5 percentage points more
than Libor with a 2 percent minimum on the benchmark, according
to Bloomberg data. The debt was sold to investors at 97.5 cents
on the dollar.  Bank of America Corp. is arranging the amendment, the
person said. Term loan lenders are being asked to respond by
Feb. 10 while lenders to the revolver have until Feb. 17. The
deal is expected to close and fund the week of Feb. 20,
according to the person.  Gary Thompson, a spokesman for Caesars, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  A term loan B is mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as
collateralized loan obligations, bank-loan mutual funds and
 hedge funds . In a revolving credit facility, money can be
borrowed again once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
