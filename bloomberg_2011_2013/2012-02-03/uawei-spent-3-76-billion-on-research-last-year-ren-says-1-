Huawei Technologies Co.,  China ’s
largest maker of phone equipment, said it spent $3.76 billion on
research and development last year to boost its competitiveness
in the global market.  The company has invested a total of $15 billion in research
over the past 10 years, which allowed the company to file 40,000
patent applications, Ren Zhengfei, chief executive officer of
the Shenzhen-based company, said in a speech to the European
Competition Forum. His prepared remarks were supplied by the
company.  Huawei is spending on research and development to aid its
expansion beyond sales of phone-network equipment into cloud
computing and mobile devices including tablet computers and
smartphones. The products will help the company more than triple
sales from 2010’s level to about $100 billion in the next five
to 10 years, the company said in April.  “Driven by competition, we have to continuously improve,”
Ren said in the speech. “A company that cannot continuously
improve and innovate through fair competition in its home market
can hardly be globally competitive.”  Huawei has also paid more than $1.2 billion to license
technology from others, an amount Ren said is “unprecedented”
among Chinese companies.  Sales were 185.2 billion yuan ($29 billion) in 2010, fueled
by growth in overseas revenue, the company said in its annual
report. Sales from outside China climbed to 65 percent of the
total from 60 percent in 2009, according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
