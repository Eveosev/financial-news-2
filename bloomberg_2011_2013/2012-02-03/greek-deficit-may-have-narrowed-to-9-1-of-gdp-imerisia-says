Greece ’s budget deficit may have
narrowed to 9.1 percent of gross domestic product last year,
Imerisia said, without citing anyone.  The 2011 deficit is expected to close at between 9.1
percent and 9.2 percent of GDP, the Athens-based newspaper said.  Revenue from a property tax imposed though electricity
bills, which could reach 2.3 billion euros ($3 billion) compared
with an initial forecast of 1.8 billion euros, and spending
cuts, especially at hospitals, helped narrow the fiscal gap, the
newspaper said.  Greece’s 2012 budget, approved by lawmakers in December,
forecast the 2011 budget deficit  figure at 9 percent of GDP
from 10.6 percent the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
