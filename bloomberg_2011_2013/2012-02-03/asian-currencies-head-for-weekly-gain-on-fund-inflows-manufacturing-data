Asian currencies rose for a fifth
week, led by  Taiwan ’s dollar, as foreign investors poured money
into the region amid optimism the global economy is recovering.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index saw its longest
weekly run of gains since October 2010 after reports this week
showed manufacturing in  the U.S. , China and  Germany  picked up in
January. The currencies were little changed yesterday as
regional stocks snapped a three-day advance after Greece and its
creditors struggled to reach an agreement on their debt swap.  “We have seen pretty good data in Asia,  Europe  and the U.S.
and that led to risk-on sentiment and supported the Asian
currencies,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at
Daiwa Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “The move is quite well
correlated with fund inflows to the region. Investors are
cautiously watching developments regarding Europe’s debt
crisis.”  The  Asia (ADXY)  Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
traded currencies excluding the yen, climbed 0.3 percent this
week to 117.78 in Singapore. It reached a three-month high
yesterday. The Taiwan dollar jumped 1.5 percent to NT$29.545 as
of the onshore close, according to Taipei Forex Inc. Thailand’s
baht appreciated 1 percent to 30.85 and India’s rupee surged 1.3
percent to 48.6950.  Foreign funds bought $2.5 billion more South Korean,
Taiwanese and Thai equities than they sold in the first four
days of this week and a net $536 million of India’s shares in
the first three days, according to exchange data.  Taiwanese Bond Rally  Greece  and its creditors are locked in talks over a debt-
swap deal for the nation. In discussions late last week in
 Athens , bondholders lowered their demands for an average coupon
on the new debt they would get after European officials demanded
they take steeper losses.  A Chinese purchasing managers’  manufacturing index  rose to
50.5 in January from 50.3 the previous month and more than the
49.6 median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, data
showed Feb. 1. Reports the same day showed Germany’s index
advanced to 51 from 48.4 and the U.S. Institute for Supply
Management’s gauge climbed to 54.1, the most since June, from a
revised 53.1.  Taiwan’s dollar completed the biggest five-day rally in a
year as foreign funds pumped money into the island’s assets and
official data on Jan. 30 showed unemployment declined in
December. Yields on the government’s 1 percent bonds due January
2017 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, this
week to 0.94 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  “Foreign inflows boosted the  Taiwan dollar ,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities
Co. “The appreciation in the Taiwan dollar has contributed to a
bond rally.”  Thai Growth Rebounding  The baht had a third consecutive weekly gain and reached a
seven-week high on Jan. 31, a day after the  finance ministry 
said gross domestic product may rise 5 percent in 2012, compared
with projected growth of 1.1 percent last year.  The ringgit climbed for a fifth week, the longest winning
streak since 2010, before data that economists predict will show
factory-output growth quickened for the first time in four
months. The ringgit added 1 percent to 3.0088 per dollar.  Industrial production increased 1.8 percent in December
from a year earlier after rising by the same magnitude in
November, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before government data due on Feb. 9.  Elsewhere, South Korea’s won rose 0.5 percent this week to
1,118.07 per dollar. The  Philippine peso  added 0.6 percent to
42.61 and  China ’s yuan strengthened 0.6 percent to 6.3028.
Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 8,980.  To contact the reporter on this story:
