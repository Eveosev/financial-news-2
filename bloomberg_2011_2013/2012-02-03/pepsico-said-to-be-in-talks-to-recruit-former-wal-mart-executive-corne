PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , set to announce a
turnaround plan next week, is trying to recruit former Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. executive Brian Cornell for a key job with the soda
and snacks company, according to two people familiar with the
discussions.  The position would report directly to Chief Executive
Officer  Indra Nooyi  and would be equivalent in status to a
division CEO, the people said.  The hiring might not happen, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the discussions are private. Other
companies also are trying to recruit Cornell, one person said.  Peter Land, a PepsiCo spokesman, declined to comment
yesterday. Cornell didn’t return a voicemail left at his home.  Cornell, 52, announced last month he would resign as chief
executive officer of  Wal-Mart’s (WMT)  Sam’s Club membership warehouse
unit. Cornell, who previously spent about 13 years at PepsiCo,
told Wal-Mart he planned to move to the U.S. Northeast for
family reasons. PepsiCo is based in Purchase,  New York .  His experience at Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer
and  PepsiCo’s (PEP)  biggest customer, could help PepsiCo maximize the
power of its vast snacks and drinks portfolio with retailers.
The company’s flagship soft drinks, including Pepsi-Cola and
Diet Pepsi, have lost share to  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , whose  stock  also
outperformed  PepsiCo (PEP)  last year.  Sam’s Club was Wal-Mart’s slowest-growing unit when Cornell
took over in 2009. He has been credited with turning the chain
around. Sam’s Club’s same-store sales gained 5.7 percent in the
quarter ended October, compared with a 1.3 percent increase for
Wal-Mart locations.  PepsiCo Positions  Cornell previously was CEO of hobby retailer Michaels
Stores Inc. from 2007 to 2009 and had an executive position at
grocery retailer  Safeway Inc. (SWY)  At PepsiCo, from 1991 until 2004,
he held positions at Tropicana and in the foodservice division
before becoming a senior sales vice president for Pepsi-Cola
 North America .  PepsiCo, the world’s largest snack-food maker and second
largest soft drink maker, is trying to dig itself out of an
earnings slump.  Nooyi may boost the advertising and marketing budget for
PepsiCo’s namesake cola and other drinks by as much as $600
million, or 50 percent, to $1.7 billion when it announces the
results of a yearlong business review Feb. 9, according to
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nooyi is seeking to take back market share from Coca-Cola
and regain the confidence of investors who have questioned
whether she has focused too much on healthier products. Some
investors and analysts have also recommended splitting the
company. PepsiCo’s shares have risen about 2 percent during her
five-year tenure while Coke has gained more than 50 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
