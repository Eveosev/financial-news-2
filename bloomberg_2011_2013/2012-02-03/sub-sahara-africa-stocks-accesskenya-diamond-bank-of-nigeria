The  FTSE/Namibia Overall Index (FTN098) 
advanced for a fourth day, jumping 1.3 percent to 938.34 in
Windhoek, the highest since July 2008.  The Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  rose 0.3
percent to 20,877.64 at the close in Lagos, according to a
statement on the bourse’s website. Mauritius’s  SEMDEX Index (SEMDEX)

All-Share Index was unchanged at 54.36 in Nairobi.  The following were among the active equities in sub-Saharan
Africa, excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS)  , the East African
nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, dropped 3.2
percent to 4.55 shillings, the lowest since the bourse debut in
June 2007, on investor concern about its business strategy after
the company said it plans to connect as many as 100 buildings
with fiber-optic links at a cost of 100 million shillings ($1.2
million) to increase market share.  “They are doing an extra investment of 100 million
shillings but investors are not very confident that kind of
investment will sustain their earnings momentum for 2012,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment
Bank Ltd., said by phone today.  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB)  , a Nigerian lender which
operates in four other African countries, advanced for a fifth
day, the longest winning streak since August, rising 2.3 percent
to 2.67 naira, as investors bet its earnings will rise in 2012.  “Investors are betting on a 2012 recovery on Diamond’s
earnings,” Adesoji Solanke, Lagos-based Africa banking analyst
at Renaissance Capital, said. The expectation is based on
“management’s guidance for a cleaner balance sheet and asset-
quality matrix going into 2012,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
