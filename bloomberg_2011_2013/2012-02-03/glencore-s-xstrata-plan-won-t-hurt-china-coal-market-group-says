Chinese thermal coal producers are
unlikely to oppose  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) ’s plan to combine
with  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  because the nation’s supply of the fuel is
diverse, said the China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association.  “I don’t think there will be much impact on the domestic
coal market,” David Fang, a Beijing-based director with the
association, said by phone. Glencore proposed a merger with
Xstrata, the world’s biggest thermal coal exporter, the
companies said yesterday.  Rising commodity demand from developing nations and the
deteriorating quality of mineral reserves is spurring producers
to combine and boost efficiency. Chinese coal customers are
buying more coal from Indonesia and Mongolia after floods cut
supply from Australia, where Xstrata has mines.  “China’s coal imports are still increasing, but imports
from Australia are on a downward trend,” Fang said.  Chinese steel mills opposed  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s failed
takeover offer for  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  in 2007 arguing the combined
company would have had too much control of the world’s iron ore
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
