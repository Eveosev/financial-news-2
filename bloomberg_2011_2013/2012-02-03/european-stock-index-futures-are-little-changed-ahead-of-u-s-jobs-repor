European (SXXP)  stocks rose for a fourth
day, extending a six-month high, after a report showed that the
U.S. economy added more jobs last month than economists had
predicted and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly retreated.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  rallied 16 percent after  Misys Plc (MSY) , the
British maker of software for banks, said it has held talks
about a merger with the Swiss company.  Admiral Group Plc (ADM)  surged
7.9 percent, the shares’ biggest rally in three years.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 1.7 percent to 264.6 at
the close, climbing to its highest level since July 29. The
benchmark measure advanced 3.6 percent this week, its sixth
weekly gain in seven.  “This is good news, with strong  job creation ,” said
 Arnaud Scarpaci , a  fund manager  at Agilis Gestion SA in Paris,
which oversees about $84 million. “The market was waiting for
this. With employment taking off, investors feel more like
buying cyclical shares.”  European (SXXP)  stocks extended their advance after a report
showed the  U.S. economy  added 243,000 jobs in January. That beat
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists for
an increase of 140,000 jobs last month. Employers hired an extra
203,000 people in December. The release also showed that the
 jobless rate  retreated to 8.3 percent, its lowest level since
February 2009.  National benchmark indexes climbed in every western-
European market today except  Greece . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index
added 1.8 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 Index gained 1.5 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX Index advanced 1.7 percent.  Finance Ministers Meet  The finance ministers of the four AAA-rated countries using
the euro -- Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and  Finland  --
meet in Berlin today. Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude
Juncker  said euro-area finance ministers won’t meet on Feb. 6 to
discuss Greece. A meeting may take place later next week, said
Juncker who chairs meetings of finance ministers from the euro
area’s 17 member states.  A report showed that  services industries  in the U.K.
unexpectedly increased last month. The measure of activity rose
to 56 in January from 54 in December, according to a statement
from Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing
and Supply . That beat the  average economist estimate  for a
reading of 53.3.  Temenos surged 16 percent to 19.90 Swiss francs, its
biggest rally since November 2008, after Misys said it has held
talks with the Swiss software maker about an all-share merger.
In a separate statement, Temenos said it is “evaluating its
strategic options.” Misys gained 1.2 percent to 329.5 pence in
London trading.  Admiral, Daimler, Bayer  Admiral jumped 7.9 percent to 1,038 pence, its biggest jump
since January 2009. The U.K. car insurer that owns the
confused.com website rose the most since January 2009 after
saying it has extended its reinsurance partnerships, without
increasing its costs.  Daimler AG (DAI) , the carmaker that makes  24 percent of its sales 
in the U.S., climbed 3.1 percent to 45.46 euros following the
U.S. jobs report.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  rose 4.4 percent to 94.70 kronor after the  world’s
second-largest truckmaker  reported fourth-quarter  earnings
before interest and taxes  that increased 26 percent to 6.96
billion kronor ($1.04 billion) from 5.52 billion kronor a year
earlier. The Gothenburg, Sweden-based manufacturer posted sales
that jumped 18 percent.  NKT Holding A/S (NKT)  surged 9.3 percent to 242.50 kroner and
