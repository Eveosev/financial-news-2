Hieronymos II, the head of Greece’s
powerful Orthodox Church, said the country’s government must
expect social upheaval if it implements further austerity
measures to secure a second financial aid package.  “Even tougher, more painful and more unfair measures are
being demanded within the same ineffective and unsuccessful
policy that is being followed,” the Archbishop said in a  letter 
addressed to Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos , a copy of
which was posted late yesterday on the website of the
 Archdiocese of Athens .  Greek officials are negotiating a second international
bailout with representatives of the so-called troika of the
European Commission,  European Central Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund  for loans that may exceed the 130 billion euros
($171 billion) now on the table.  “We are being asked to take even larger doses of a
medicine that has proven to be deadly and to undertake
commitments that do not solve the problem, but only temporarily
postpone the foretold death of our economy,” the Archbishop
said, in the letter.  The fiscal policy being implemented in  Greece  with repeated
wage cuts and “unbearable” new taxes has led to a jump in
homelessness, company closures, suicides and unemployment as
well as to hunger not seen since the second world war and to the
emigration of the young and the country’s best minds, said the
Archbishop, who rarely makes political comments.  “The voices of the desperate, the voices of Greeks are
being provocatively ignored in decision making,” the Archbishop
said. “The unprecedented patience of the Greek people is
running out, fear is giving way to rage and the risk of a social
explosion can no longer be ignored by those who give orders and
those who execute their lethal recipes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
