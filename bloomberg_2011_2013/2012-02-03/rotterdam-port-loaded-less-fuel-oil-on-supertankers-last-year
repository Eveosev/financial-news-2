The Port of Rotterdam said 31
supertankers loaded  fuel oil  from its facilities last year, down
from 35 vessels in 2010.  A total 7.9 million metric tons of the product were loaded
onto very large crude carriers in 2011, or an average 255,000
tons per VLCC, and were transported to  Singapore , the port said
in a  statement  posted on its website today. Twenty-two of the
ships combined unloading crude with loading fuel oil, it said.  “A combination trip is relatively profitable for ship
owners in paying port dues,” the port said. The average VLCC
rate for a Rotterdam to Singapore voyage was $3.5 million.  The biggest charterer for the route was Cargill Inc., with
seven tankers carrying 1.85 million tons of  fuel oil . Gunvor
Group Ltd. was the second-largest with four VLCCs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
