The  Super Bowl  rematch between the
 New York Giants  and  New England Patriots  was predicated upon
money spent on player contracts, venue construction and pricey
seats before the annual National Football League contest gets
underway at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Feb. 5.  1. Big Money  Maybe they should call it the Super (Expensive) Bowl. With
nosebleed game tickets topping $2,200, hotel rooms marked up as
much as 1,758 percent and 30-second television ads selling for
an average of $3.5 million or $116,667 a second, Super Bowl XLVI
is a corporate and consumer spending spree. It is marketing and
merchandising gone mad -- the NFL even offers up a Commemorative
Super Bowl app at $2.99 or 50 percent off pre-game. What follows
are some of the  larger costs  in the Super Bowl economy.  2. Building the Stadium  Before Indianapolis could make a bid to host a Super Bowl, it
needed a stadium worthy of the NFL championship. Lucas Oil
Stadium cost $720 million to build at a very real cost to
taxpayers. The  Indianapolis Colts  provided $100 million, and the
state of Indiana and city of Indianapolis both raised funds.
Marion County increased taxes on food and beverage sales, auto
rentals, and hotels, among other things. Surrounding areas added
a 1 percent restaurant tax. The Capital Improvement Board, which
oversees the stadium, may lose about $800,000 hosting the game.  3. Building the Teams  According to NFL.com, the Patriots and Giants spent about the
same amount on player salaries this season -- $63.7 million for
the Giants and $62.3 million for the Patriots. Just how they
allocated that money was very different. The Patriots spent much
more on offense salaries ($39.7 million vs. the Giants’ $30.4
million) and more on special team’s salaries ($4 million vs.
$3.5 million). New York outspent the Patriots on their defensive
players, paying $29.8 million compared with $18.6 million for
 New England .  4. Being a Good Host  The Indianapolis Super Bowl Committee’s operating budget for its
three-block Super Bowl Village is $25 million, which was raised
privately from individuals and corporations. A good chunk of
that $25 million paid for the village venue, which includes four
zip lines, the super dash (run in human-sized hamster wheels)
and 75 bands. Among other outlays, the city of Indianapolis
budgeted $4 million for public safety costs to be reimbursed by
the Capital Improvement Board through taxes generated from
hotels, restaurants, and so on. PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts
direct Super Bowl spending in the Indianapolis area will be
about $150 million, though other estimates place the number at
$356 million.  5. Ticket Lotteries  The majority of tickets go to the two teams, which hold drawings
for full-season ticket holders and those with club seats or
suites. To get season tickets, Giants’ fans pay a one-time
personal seat license, or PSL. In 2011, a $20,000 PSL gave the
right to buy tickets at the 50-yard-line Coaches Club at $700
per game. A $7,500 PSL in the Mezzanine B section offered the
right to buy tickets for $400 a game. Patriots’ fans who want
season tickets face a long waiting list. To get on the list fans
pay $100 for a membership. Season tickets cost between $65 and
$185 per game.  6. Ticket Resellers  The face values of tickets are $800 to $1,200. The cheapest
listing on SeatGeek, an event ticket aggregator, is $2,247 for
an upper-deck end-zone seat. Prices have declined recently,
according to TiqIQ, a ticket event aggregator that tracks
listings from StubHub,  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , TicketNetwork and TicketsNow.
The average ticket price fell to $3,982 from $4,311 since Jan.
27; the cheapest ticket fell from $2,400 to $2,090. The most
expensive ticket purchased on the NFL Ticket Exchange, the
league’s official resale website, was sold the week of Jan. 23
for $16,480.  7. TV Upgrades  According to a  National Retail Federation  survey, 5.1 percent of
Americans will buy 5.1 million new TVS for the game. The
 Consumer Electronics Association  says about 1.9 million TVs were
bought in the first six weeks of 2011, a number unchanged from
2010. Currently, 87 percent of Americans have a high-definition
television, the industry group says.  Consumer Reports  says it
makes sense to wait until late February when retailers usually
discount TVs to make room for new models.  8. Vegas Gambling  Last year the Nevada Gaming Control Board counted $87.5 million
in bets on the Super Bowl, an increase of 5.8 percent from 2010.
Far more -- as much as $10 billion -- is bet in office pools and
with illegal bookies. Such figures are “nonsense,” says Eugene
Christiansen of consulting firm Christiansen Capital Advisors.
“No one has a basis for such estimates.” Many Vegas bookies
are rooting for the Patriots because of large bets made on the
Giants in late 2011, when a four-game losing streak made them,
at one time, 100-1 underdogs to win the Super Bowl.  9. High-priced Visits  Cheaphotels.org compared rates for hotels in and near
Indianapolis on Feb. 5-6 with the rate a week later. The biggest
markup was at Knights Inn, Indianapolis Airport, where the rate
for Super Bowl weekend is $725. A week later, the price drops to
$39. For those with no budget concerns, flying by private plane
is popular. Nicholas Bozzo, of PlaneClear in  Long Island City ,
 New York , says volume out of New York for Super Bowl weekend is
up 50 percent to 60 percent compared to last year. Planes with
six or seven seats go for $12,000, he says, while 12-to-14-
seaters run $30,000.  10. Super Parties  Leading up to the game, “there will be hundreds of parties with
thousands of people at each,” according to Tim Fraser of
TicketNetwork.com, which allows licensed sellers to make tickets
available on its site. In Indianapolis, for those who don’t get
complimentary passes, a ticket to the Maxim VIP Party with Maxim
girls, food, open bar and live entertainment is being offered
for $1,603 on TicketNetwork.com, while a ticket into the Playboy
VIP Party with live music by Ne-Yo can be had for $1,508. A
ticket to the ESPN party, where Drake will perform, is selling
for $1,037. For those on a budget, there’s the Leather & Laces
party hosted by Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra. Ticket-
sellers are asking $437 to almost $9,000.  11. Snacks and gear  Consumers are expected to spend $11 billion on game-related
food, clothing and merchandise, according to the National Retail
Federation. That’s $64 per person, up from $60 last year. Nearly
$700 million will go for snacks, including 1.25 billion chicken
wings that increase in price in the fourth quarter as
restaurants stock up. On game day,  Yum! Brands Inc. (YUM) ’s  Pizza Hut ,
whose sales jump 50 percent compared with normal Sundays,
expects to sell more than two million pizzas -- 80 percent with
pepperoni -- at about $10 each. Public Affairs Director
Christopher Fuller says Feb. 5 could be Pizza Hut’s best day
ever.  12. Television Ads  As many as 115 million viewers will watch the game, according to
a Bloomberg story.  NBC Universal , which renewed its contract
with the NFL for an undisclosed amount, has sold all 70 ad slots
at an average price of $3.5 million. Among this year’s ads:
Hyundai shows how its car can quicken the pulse of a man with no
pulse and Samsung mocks  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  fans with its own version of
the “Next Big Thing.” Last year, in the week after they ran
Super Bowl ads, VW Passat interest surged 70 percent on
Edmunds.com and Chrysler interest soared 87 percent.  13. Bonuses and Rings  Players on the winning team receive an $88,000 bonus, while
losing players get $44,000. Those payouts have risen since the
first Super Bowl in 1967, when winners got $15,000 and losers
received $7,500, the equivalent of $102,000 and $51,000 in
inflation-adjusted dollars. Players, coaches, executives and
others associated with the winning team also get Super Bowl
rings. While the NFL will pay up to $5,000 per ring for 150
rings, prices can go well beyond that depending on the level of
bling desired. The  Green Bay Packers ’ 2011 rings are made of
platinum and 18-karat gold, with 3.35 carats of diamonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
