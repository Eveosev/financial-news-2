Stocks surged, extending the best
start to a year for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since 1987,
and Treasuries slid as better-than-forecast growth in U.S. jobs
bolstered optimism in the economy. Cocoa, lead and zinc led
commodities higher while gold, silver and natural gas fell.  The  S&P 500  increased 1.5 percent to 1,344.90 at 4 p.m. in
New York and is up 6.9 percent in 2012.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year U.S.
Treasury notes climbed 11 basis points to 1.93 percent, the
biggest increase since November. The  Dollar Index (DXY)  was little
changed, erasing earlier gains. Oil rebounded from a six-week
low, while gold and silver fell more than 1 percent.  The S&P 500 capped a fifth straight weekly gain, its
longest streak in a year, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
climbed above its highest closing level since May 2008. The
243,000 increase in payrolls was the most since April and
exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The
 unemployment rate  dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since
February 2009. Equities extended gains after a gauge of service
industries also showed faster-than-forecast growth.  “Wow,” James Dunigan, who helps oversee $107 billion as
chief investment officer in Philadelphia for PNC Wealth
Management, said in a telephone interview. “The jobs report
confirms that this recovery is stronger than many people think.
It speaks well to what earnings will be going forward and to
what the possibilities are for equities. The riskier assets may
turn out to be the ones with less risk.”  Cyclicals Lead  Gains in  stocks  today were led by companies that are most-
dependent on economic growth, with gauges of financial,
consumer-discretionary, energy and industrial and stocks
climbing more than 1.7 percent for the best gains among the 10
main industries in the S&P 500. Bank of America Corp., Alcoa
Inc. and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  rose more than 3 percent for the
biggest gains in the Dow, which rallied 156.82 points, or 1.2
percent, to 12,862.23.  The S&P SmallCap 600 Index climbed 2.1 percent to the
highest level since the gauge was started in 1989. The Nasdaq
Composite Index rose 1.6 percent, reaching the highest level
since December 2000.  The median projection in the Bloomberg survey called for
payrolls to rise by 140,000. Revisions added a total of 60,000
jobs to payrolls in November and December. The so-called
underemployment rate -- which includes part-time workers who’d
prefer a full-time position and people who want work but have
given up looking -- decreased to 15.1 percent from 15.2 percent.  ISM Beats  Equities extended gains after a private report showed
 service industries  in the U.S. expanded in January at the
fastest pace in almost a year, pointing to strength in the
biggest part of the economy. The  Institute for Supply
Management ’s non-manufacturing index rose to 56.8, topping the
median forecast of 77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for
a reading of 53.2.  The S&P 500 has rallied 22 percent since its 2011  low  on
Oct. 3 as the  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep  interest rates  low
through 2014, economic data topped estimates and the  European
Central Bank  provided cheaper lending to help banks.  The S&P 500 has recovered after plunging 19 percent
between April 29 and Oct. 3. It’s now 1.4 percent away from
surpassing its peak nine months ago and reaching the highest
level since June 2008.  Earnings beat projections at about two-thirds of the 264
companies in the S&P 500 that reported results since Jan. 9,
according to data compiled by  Bloomberg. (SPX)   Earnings Season  Profits in the S&P 500 are forecast to rise 9 percent this
year to $104.68 a share, according to analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. At yesterday’s close, the index was trading at
12.7 times projected earnings in 2012 and 11.2 times predictions
for 2013. The benchmark gauge for American equities has traded
at an average  price-earnings  ratio of 16.4 since 1954, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “If the strong jobs market continues we would be inclined
to increase our expectations for earnings,” Tim Hoyle, director
of research at Radnor, Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co.,
which manages $6 billion, said in a phone interview. “This jobs
report favors cyclical stocks over defensive stocks. It makes
you rethink your balance between cyclically sensitive sectors
versus the defensive sectors.”  Canada’s S&P/TSX index of stocks capped a seventh straight
weekly advance, its longest rally since 2009. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index gained 0.4 percent, for a weekly increase of 3.1
percent. The gauge has risen for five straight weeks, the
longest rally since October 2010.  European Shares  The Stoxx 600 advanced 3.6 percent  this week , the sixth
gain in seven weeks and largest rally since the beginning of
December. A gauge of U.K. services activity based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose in January to 56, the highest since
March, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply  said today.  Xstrata Plc and Glencore International Plc surged more than
13 percent this week after the world’s largest publicly traded
commodities trader held talks to buy the Zug, Switzerland-based
mining company. Temenos Group AG rallied 20 percent in the week
as Misys Plc, the British maker of software for banks, said it
has held merger talks with the Swiss company.  The yield on Portuguese 10-year bonds slid 138 basis points
to 13.43 percent. Greek 10-year bonds rose, sending the yield
down 18 basis points to 34.19 percent. Deutsche Bank AG Chief
Executive Officer  Josef Ackermann  may travel to  Athens  this
weekend for talks over a swap involving Greek debt with a face
value of about 200 billion euros ($263 billion).  European Rescue Talks  A new rescue plan, which European officials and Greek
creditors say may be wrapped up in coming days, includes a loss
of more than 70 percent for bondholders in a voluntary exchange
and loans likely to exceed the 130 billion euros now on the
table.  The ECB is considering using its bond holdings to bolster
 Greece ’s next rescue program and support efforts to contain the
sovereign debt crisis, three euro-region officials said.  Under one plan, the ECB could sell its Greek bonds to the
European Financial Stability Facility at the price it paid for
them rather than accept a loss along with private creditors, two
of the people said. The EFSF is against that proposal because it
may stretch its capacity, the officials said.  Another plan is for euro-area central banks to give up
profits or take losses on Greek bonds in their investment
portfolios. Several options are under informal consideration and
none have gained traction so far, two of the officials said.
Spokespeople for the ECB and the EFSF declined to comment.  Commodities  Sixteen of the 24 commodities in the S&P GSCI Index
advanced, sending the gauge up 1.3 percent. Cocoa, zinc and lead
rallied more than 2.8 percent. Crude oil added 1.5 percent to
$97.84 a barrel, snapping a five-day drop. Copper futures jumped
3.2 percent, the most in two months. Gold slumped the most in
five weeks, falling 1.1 percent to settle at $1,740.30 an ounce.
Silver lost 1.2 percent. Natural gas lost 2.2 percent on
predictions for mild weather.  The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent to extend a
third straight weekly gain, its longest stretch in seven months
amid speculation the central bank may lower reserve-ratio
requirements.  India ’s Sensex increased for a fourth day,
advancing 1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
