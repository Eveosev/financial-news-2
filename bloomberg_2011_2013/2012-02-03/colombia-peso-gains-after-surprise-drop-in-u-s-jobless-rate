Colombia ’s peso rose to a five-month
high after reports showing employment in the U.S. climbed more
than forecast while the jobless rate unexpectedly dropped
boosted demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 1,785.30 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:10 a.m. in Bogota, from 1,793.88 yesterday. Earlier it
touched 1,779.88, the strongest since Sept. 2. The currency
headed for a fifth weekly gain, jumping 1.3 percent in the last
five days.  “The U.S. jobs number was pretty good and Latin American
currencies are reacting positively,” said Patricia Gonzalez, an
analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the nation’s second-biggest bank.  The 243,000 increase in U.S. payrolls in January was the
most since April and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey, Labor Department figures showed in  Washington . The
 unemployment rate  dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since
February 2009.  The Colombian currency also advanced as increased dollar
holdings in local banks reduced the forward curve, “creating an
incentive” to borrow abroad, said Gonzalez.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso bonds due
July 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
7.35 percent, according to the central bank. The bond’s price
fell 0.1320 centavo to 121.0830 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
