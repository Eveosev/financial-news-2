German Environment Minister Norbert Roettgen and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, who disagreed on
solar-power subsidies, are in talks to draw up a joint policy as
a local newspaper said payments may be cut as early as April.  The ministers in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government met
on Feb. 1, are in “intensive” discussions and plan to table a
combined proposal to adjust solar power subsidies “as quickly
as possible,” Frauke Stamer, a spokeswoman for Roettgen, said
in Berlin today. Ann-Christin Wiegemann, Roesler’s spokeswoman,
also confirmed the talks at the briefing for journalists.  Germany  may cut the state’s support as early as April to
contain an expected rush in installations in the first half,
 Rheinische Post  said yesterday, without citing anyone.  The ministers disagreed after Germany,  Europe ’s biggest
renewables market, installed a record 7.5 gigawatts of solar
panels last year, more than double the government’s target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
