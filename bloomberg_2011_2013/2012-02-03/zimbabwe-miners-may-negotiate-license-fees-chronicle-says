Mining companies may negotiate
license fees they pay to  Zimbabwe ’s government if they can prove
they can’t afford newly proposed tariffs, the  Chronicle  said,
citing a mines ministry official it didn’t identify.  The ministry last month proposed that mining licenses be
raised to $1,000 per hectare from $10 for five licenses,
irrespective of the number of permits, or claims as they are
known, the Bulawayo-based Chronicle said. Gold-buying licenses
may be doubled to $5,000 a year, it added.  Registration of a platinum license may rise to $2.5 million
from $300, while the price of a platinum prospector’s license
will climb to $500,000 from $150, according to proposals seen by
the Chronicle.  The proposed fee increase hasn’t been made public or signed
into law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
