Tin traders probably added to wagers
that the metal will gain as the number of outstanding contracts
climbed to a three-month high at the same time as prices rose.  Open interest in London Metal Exchange tin futures climbed
by 2,138 lots, or 8.9 percent, to 26,200 contracts in the week
ended Feb. 1, the highest level since Oct. 13, according to LME
figures. Each lot represents 5 metric tons of the metal used in
packaging or to join metals together. The benchmark contract for
three-month delivery advanced 7.6 percent in the period.  An increase in open interest as prices rise suggests new
long positions, or bets on higher prices, according to Macquarie
Group Ltd. Open interest in LME tin climbed 15 percent last
month, the biggest increase since July 2009.  Following are changes to market open interest for both LME
members and their clients for the six biggest industrial-metals
futures traded on the exchange. The figures were compiled by the
LME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
