BP Plc (BP/)  and its partners developing
the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli project in Azerbaijanâ€™s section of the
Caspian Sea produced 35.3 million metric tons of oil last year,
down 13 percent from the previous year, Turan said.  Condensate output from the Shah Deniz field, being
developed by another BP-led group that includes  Statoil ASA (STL)  and
State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, fell almost 16 percent to 1.6
million tons, the privately owned news service reported, without
specifying where it got the information.  Tamam Bayatli, a spokeswoman for BP in the Azeri capital of
Baku, said the company will release output figures for Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli, known as ACG, and Shah Deniz later this month.  Azerbaijan, the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , decreased crude production 11 percent to 45.4
million tons last year, while natural gas output fell 2.4
percent to 25.7 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
