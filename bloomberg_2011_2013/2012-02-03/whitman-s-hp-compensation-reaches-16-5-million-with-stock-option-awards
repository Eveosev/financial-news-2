Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPG)  Chief Executive
Officer  Meg Whitman , who agreed to a $1-a-year salary when she
succeeded  Leo Apotheker  last year, received stock option awards
that brought her compensation for fiscal 2011 to $16.5 million.  Whitman, 55, who is also president, received option awards
valued at $16.1 million, plus $372,598 in other compensation
last year, Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard said
today in a  filing  to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The executive was named head of the world’s largest
personal-computer maker in September. Apotheker, 58, who was
fired after less than 11 months at the helm, got $30.4 million
in the year ended Oct. 31, according to the filing. That was 84
percent more than Whitman’s package.  Hewlett-Packard rose 2 percent to $29.07 at the close in
 New York . The shares have fallen 39 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
