Yandex NV (YNDX)  climbed to a two-month high
in  New York  as enthusiasm for Internet stocks spurred by
Facebook Inc.’s initial public offering lured investors to the
cheapest Russian web company.  The operator of  Russia ’s most popular Internet search
engine, Yandex led gainers on the  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index 
of Russian companies traded in New York, which was little
changed at 105.82 yesterday as seven stocks rose and six
declined.  Futures (VEA)  expiring in March on Moscow’s dollar-
denominated  RTS index (RTSI$)  were also steady at 159,930 in U.S.
trading. Urals crude oil hit an 11-week high.  Emerging-market Internet stocks from Chinese online game
developer  Perfect World Co. (PWRD)  to  South Korea ’s largest search
engine  NHN Corp. (035420)  have rallied since Facebook filed for what will
be the largest IPO for an  Internet company . Yandex, which has
slumped 45 percent since its May IPO, trades at 38 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, compared with 43 times for
competitor Mail.ru Group Ltd., the largest Russian-language web
company.  “Investors have taken a refreshed look at Russia’s
Internet stocks on the back of Facebook’s IPO and Yandex has
come out as the winner today,” said Marco Casas, vice president
for equity sales at Otkritie Financial Corp. in New York. “We
expect momentum to continue in the next few days as investor
interest in Russian Internet names, such as Yandex, increases.”  Yandex advanced 3.6 percent to $21.39 in New York
yesterday, the highest level since Dec. 7.  Mail.ru (MAIL) , which has a
2.3 percent stake in Facebook, fell 0.6 percent to $33.60 in
 London , after rising for the previous six days.  ‘Yandex Undervalued’  Internet advertising  in Russia will increase 25 percent
this year from 2011, while the overall ad market will probably
expand 10 percent, HSBC Holding Plc analyst Jean Kaplan wrote in
a Jan. 13 report. The Internet’s share of total Russian
advertising will jump to 26 percent by 2018, from 14 percent
last year, as more Russians buy computers and access the Web,
Kaplan said.  “Everybody has been buying Russian Internet stocks on the
Facebook IPO news,” said Konstantin Chernyshev, head of
research at UralSib Financial Corp in Moscow. “According to our
estimates, Yandex is undervalued by 26 percent. Yandex is
cheaper than Mail.ru, so if you buy Russian Internet, you buy
Yandex.”  The Hague, Netherlands-based Yandex’s  share  of the Russian
search market declined to 59.7 percent in the week through Jan.
22, from 59.9 percent the previous week and below the four-week
average of 59.8 percent, according to Liveinternet.ru, an
Internet-service provider and researcher. Moscow-based Mail.ru’s
audience rose to 8.5 percent in the week to Jan. 22, from 8.1
percent the week before and above the four-week average of 8.2
percent, the data showed.  Search Share  Yandex, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 22,
introduced a free search application for the Apple Inc. iPhone
in December, part of an effort to expand its mobile offerings.  Yandex’s search share fell to 59.4 percent in the week
through Jan. 29, while Mail.ru’s rose to 9 percent, Liveinternet
data showed.  Mountain View , California-based  Google (GOOG)  Inc.’s share
of the Russian search market fell to 25.5 percent from 25.7
percent the previous week. Google trades at 14 times analysts’
earnings estimates.  “Yandex has been a laggard among Russian equities, so this
is a chance to play catch-up.” Tom Furda, director of Russian
equity sales at Auerbach Grayson & Co.’s Moscow-based brokerage
partner UralSib Financial Corp., said by phone yesterday.  Falling Volatility  The  RTS Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in
the index futures, was little changed at 30.95, the lowest level
since Aug. 4. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund
that holds Russian shares, fell for the first time in three
days, losing 0.5 percent to $30.99.  Russia’s central bank meets to review key  interest rates  in
Moscow today, after cutting the  refinancing rate  by 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 8 percent in December. OAO
Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, will report fourth-
quarter results.  American depositary receipts of  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s
biggest natural gas exporter, climbed to the highest level since
Nov. 8 in New York, adding 1 percent to $12.40 after its  shares 
traded in Moscow rose 0.8 percent to 187.24 rubles, or the
equivalent of $6.18. One ADR represents two ordinary shares.  Gazprom  trades  at 3.6 times analysts’ estimated earnings,
while smaller Russian oil and gas producer  OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) 
trades at 5.8 times.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s largest
energy company, has a ratio of 7.2, and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the
world’s largest energy company by market value, has 10.2.  Gazprom ‘Unloved’  “Gazprom is unloved, it’s straightforwardly cheap and
there’s every chance that you’ll see improvements in corporate
governance over the next six to 12 months,” Martin Diggle,
director of the $70 million  Vulpes Russian Opportunities Fund (ARTRUSS) ,
said by phone from Geneva yesterday. The Vulpes Fund lost 13
percent in 2011, ranking in the 69th percentile, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Moscow-based Gazprom said in December that it may double
its dividend payout for 2011 to a record and cut planned
investments for this year by 39 percent.  ADRs of Gazprom Neft, Gazprom’s oil producing arm, gained
1.1 percent to $24.90 as Brent oil for March settlement rose 0.5
percent to $112.07 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange.  Urals, Russia’s chief export blend, added 0.6 percent to
$112.30, the highest level since Nov. 15.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) , Russia’s largest hydropower producer, fell in
U.S. trading on concern colder weather in Russia will reduce
electricity production, and as Deutsche Bank AG cut its target
price for the company’s stock. RusHydro’s ADRs dropped 1.5
percent to $3.91, paring their advance to 29 percent this year.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  in Moscow rose 0.2 percent to 1,602.99, and
the 30-stock Micex Index gained 0.2 percent to 1,542.39.  To contact the reporters on this story:
