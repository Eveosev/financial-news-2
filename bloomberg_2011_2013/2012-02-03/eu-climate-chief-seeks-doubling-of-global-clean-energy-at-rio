European Union Climate Commissioner
 Connie Hedegaard  said countries meeting at a conference in June
should pledge to double the share of renewable energy they use
by 2030 and give all citizens access to sustainable power.  The nations also need to double the world’s energy
efficiency, Hedegaard told reporters today in New Delhi.  World leaders will gather in Rio de Janeiro in June for the
United Nations Conference on  Sustainable Development , known as
Rio+20 in policy circles. The first conference in Rio in 1992,
known as the Earth Summit, drew  108 heads of state  and set up
the UN Framework Convention on  Climate Change  to stabilize
increasing greenhouse gas emissions.  “If we could have these targets accepted by the whole
world in Rio, then we could make a substantial step forward,”
Hedegaard said, declining to say whether promises made at the
conference should be legally binding.  China and  India  have clashed with richer nations that are
seeking to make the commitments at the conference enforceable.
India’s Environment Minister Jayanthi Natarajan said today it
will press richer nations to shoulder a larger burden so poorer
countries that weren’t responsible for emissions in the past
aren’t saddled with measures to combat climate change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
