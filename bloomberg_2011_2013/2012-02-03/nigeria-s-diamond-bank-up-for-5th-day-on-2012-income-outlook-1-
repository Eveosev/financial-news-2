Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian lender,
jumped for a fifth straight day to its longest rising streak in
more than five months after investors bet earnings will grow in
2012, Renaissance capital said.  The stock added 2.3 percent to 2.67 naira by the 2:30 p.m.
close in Lagos, taking its gain this year to 39 percent,
compared with a 0.6 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index.  “Investors are betting on a 2012 recovery in Diamond’s
earnings,” Adesoji Solanke, Lagos-based Africa banking analyst
at Rencap, said. The expectation is based on “management’s
guidance for a cleaner balance sheet and asset-quality matrix
going into 2012,” he said.  Diamond expects a loss of about 454.4 million naira ($2.8
million) for the fourth quarter through December, it said on
Sept. 8.  Nigeria ’s central bank implemented reforms following a
debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 triggered by loans given to stock
market speculators. The banking regulator introduced December as
a common year-end for the country’s lenders. Full-year 2011
results are expected to be released from the end of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
