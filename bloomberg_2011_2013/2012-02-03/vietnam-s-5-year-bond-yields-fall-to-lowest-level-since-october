Vietnamese bonds advanced, pushing
benchmark five-year yields to the lowest since October, on
speculation demand will improve as debt redemptions boost cash
in the financial system. The dong strengthened.  “A number of  government bonds  will mature later this
month, so some people are pushing yields lower,” said Pham Phuong Lan, the Hanoi-based head of fixed-income and currency
trading at the Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The yield on the benchmark  five-year  bonds retreated one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.37 percent, the
lowest since Oct. 14, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong strengthened 0.2 percent to 20,970 per dollar,
according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The  State
Bank  of Vietnam fixed its daily reference  rate  at 20,828,
unchanged from Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  Vietnam ’s trade deficit narrowed to $100 million last
month, compared with a revised deficit of $269 million in
December, according to preliminary data released yesterday by
the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. Editors: Anil Varma, Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
