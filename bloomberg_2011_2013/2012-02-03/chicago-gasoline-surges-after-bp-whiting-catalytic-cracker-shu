Chicago gasoline strengthened after
 BP Plc (BP)  shut a fluid catalytic cracker for unplanned repairs at
the Whiting refinery in Indiana.  The unit is one of two catalytic crackers at the 420,000-
barrel-a-day plant, according to a person familiar with refinery
operations who declined to comment because the information isnâ€™t
public.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  narrowed 5.5 cents to 14.5 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:52 p.m. The
fuel has strengthened from a discount of 33 cents on Jan. 24.
Prompt delivery rose 8.46 cents to $2.7535 a gallon.  The same fuel in  New York Harbor (MOSNY87P)  held at a premium of 1.88
cents to futures. Prompt delivery rose 2.41 cents to $2.9118 a
gallon.  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  reported that a compressor associated with a
reformer in the Girard Point section of the Philadelphia
refinery lost power yesterday, according to a filing with city
regulators. Power was restored before the unit was shut down,
the filing showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
