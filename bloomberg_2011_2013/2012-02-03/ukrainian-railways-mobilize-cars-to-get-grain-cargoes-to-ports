Ukraine ’s state-managed railway
company Ukrzaliznytsya will focus its available cars to help
deliver grain cargoes to ports for export.  “Grain rail cars are now concentrated in transporting the
2011 grain harvest inside the country” after demand increased,
the company said today in a  statement  on its website.
Ukrzaliznytsya temporarily limited the availability of cars to
carry other products outside Ukraine, according to the
statement.  Ukraine’s grain exports fell 27 percent in January compared
with the previous month, the Agrarian Confederation said Feb. 1.
The decline was partially caused by decreasing availability of
rail cars to deliver cereals to ports, the Confederation said.
Ukrzaliznytsya has 11,579 grain cars, with about 1,000 operating
outside Ukraine, the company said.  Grain producers and exporters were getting too few cars
from Ukrzaliznytsya, Volodymyr Klymenko, head of the country’s
Grain Association, said on Jan. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
