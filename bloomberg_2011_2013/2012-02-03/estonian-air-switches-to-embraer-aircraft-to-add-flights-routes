AS Estonian Air, the country’s
national carrier, will switch to  Embraer SA (EMBR3) ’s E-Jet aircraft to
add flights and routes instead of earlier plans to purchase
airplanes from  Canada ’s  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)   The airline, 90 percent owned by the government, will lease
four Embraer 170 aircraft from  Finnair Oyj (FIA1S)  this month and is in
talks with the manufacturer and leasing companies over the
delivery schedule and conditions for eight more aircraft, the
Tallinn-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Baltic government said last November Estonian Air will
receive 30 million euros ($41 million) over two years to
purchase five aircraft from Canada’s Bombardier Inc., partly
replacing the company’s existing Boeing aircraft.  Embraer’s “suit the company’s new strategy due to their
efficiency, appropriate size and flying range,” Chief Executive
Officer Tero Taskila said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
