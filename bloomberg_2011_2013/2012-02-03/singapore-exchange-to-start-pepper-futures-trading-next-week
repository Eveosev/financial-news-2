The Singapore Mercantile Exchange
will start trading black pepper futures contracts from Feb. 10
as it seeks to develop a platform for the commodity grown mostly
in  Asia , the bourse said in a statement today.  The contracts will be for pepper that weighs 550 grams per
liter, the common grade in Asia, the exchange said. Vietnam
dominates the world pepper market with an export share of 43
percent, while other major exporters include Indonesia, Malaysia
and  India , it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
