Canada ’s currency advanced to its
strongest in three months versus the U.S. dollar as payrolls in
America, the nation’s biggest trade partner, rose more than
forecast and its jobless rate fell to the lowest since 2009.  The currency, called the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, extended gains as another report
showed U.S. service industries grew at the fastest pace in a
year. It had weakened earlier after data showed Canada’s
employers added fewer jobs in January than economists forecast.
The loonie gained for a fourth week, its longest winning streak
since October, as appetite for risk increased.  “Canada’s major trading partner had data that came out
that was very positive, and that has impacted a risk-on
sentiment,” said  David Watt , senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in Toronto.  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 99.34
cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto and reached 99.28
cents, the strongest since Oct. 31. The loonie, which declined
0.4 percent earlier to C$1.0034, gained 0.9 percent this week.
One Canadian dollar buys $1.0066.  The currency strengthened beyond its 200-day moving average
against the greenback, now 99.63 Canadian cents, for the first
time since September. In technical analysis, the use of charts
to predict stock moves, surpassing a moving average is a signal
an asset may continue to rise.  The loonie may now advance to 98.92 Canadian cents per
dollar and then to 98 cents, RBC’s Watt said.  Major Counterparts  The loonie strengthened against the majority of its 16
most-traded counterparts.  South Africa ’s rand and  Mexico ’s peso
were the top performers, while the  U.S. dollar  and yen fell
versus most major peers as haven demand waned.  “The Canadian dollar reversed all of the weakness that we
saw after the labor-force survey in Canada, which was relatively
weak,” Charles St-Arnaud, an economist and foreign-exchange
strategist at Nomura Securities in New York, said in a telephone
interview.  Stocks climbed, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rising
1.5 percent and the MSCI World Index advancing 1.1 percent.  Canada’s government bonds dropped for a third day, pushing
the yield on the benchmark  10-year note  up the most this year.
It climbed as much as nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, the biggest jump since Dec. 20, to 2.03 percent, the
highest level since Jan. 26. It closed at 2.02 percent. The
yield difference between the securities and comparable U.S.
Treasuries narrowed to nine basis points, from 12 yesterday.  Employment Data  The loonie erased losses as Labor Department data in
 Washington  showed U.S. payrolls swelled by 243,000 jobs last
month, following a revised increase of 203,000 in December. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey was for an addition
of 140,000. The unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent, from 8.5
percent.  The growth cast doubt on the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to
hold  interest rates  at virtually zero until late 2014.  U.S. service industries, which account for about 70 percent
of the economy, expanded in January more than forecast. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing index rose
to 56.8 from a revised 53 in December, versus the 53.2 projected
in a Bloomberg survey. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Canada’s jobless rate rose to 7.6 percent in January, from
7.5 percent in December. Employers added a  net 2,300 jobs ,
following a revised gain of 21,700 in December, the nation’s
statistics agency said today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News had forecast the  unemployment rate  would hold steady and
that 22,000 positions would be added.  “Another disappointing number,” said Blake Jespersen,
director of foreign exchange at Bank of Montreal in Toronto, in
a telephone interview.  Parity With Greenback  The loonie touched a level stronger than parity with the
U.S. dollar on Jan. 26 for the first time since November. It
slid 2.3 percent in 2011.  The currency rose 1.1 percent against the greenback last
week as commodities gained after the Fed pledged to extend its
freeze on U.S.  interest rates . The benchmark has been zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008, compared to Canada’s 1 percent
 rate . Fed policy makers said the option for further moves to
stimulate the economy remained open.  Canada’s dollar gained 2.6 percent over the past three
months against nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The U.S. dollar
rose 1 percent, while the euro dropped 4.4 percent. The  New
Zealand  and Australian dollars were the top performers, climbing
6.7 percent and 4.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
