Lubelski Wegiel Bogdanka SA (LWB) , a Polish
coal producer, will use 53.6 million zloty ($17 million) from
reserves set aside for property tax after a court decision last
September, the company said in a regulatory statement yesterday.  As a result, profit will increase by 58.8 million zloty,
while 16.6 million zloty will be kept in reserve for other
disputable tax liabilities, Bogdanka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
