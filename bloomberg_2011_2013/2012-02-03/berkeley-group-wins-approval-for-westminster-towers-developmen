Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by value, will develop two
residential towers in  London ’s Westminster district, after
winning approval from the borough.  Abell House and Cleland House will be demolished and
replaced by 11-story and 12-story buildings, with apartments
ranging from one to four bedrooms, according to a planning
application submitted by Berkeley Group. The development was
approved by the borough last night, Charles Begley, an external
spokesman for Berkeley, said by e-mail.  About 275 apartments will be built at the sites on John
Islip Street, where the Tate Britain museum is located.  Affluent overseas investors are buying residential real
estate in the U.K. capital to protect wealth from economic and
political unrest at home. Cobham, England-based Berkeley has
benefited by concentrating on London and southeast, where  house
prices  have been the most resilient.  To contact the reporters on this story:
