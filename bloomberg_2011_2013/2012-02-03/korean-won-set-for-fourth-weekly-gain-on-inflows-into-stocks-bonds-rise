South Korea ’s won completed a fourth
weekly gain as signs the global economy is recovering spurred
capital inflows into the nation’s stocks. Bonds advanced.  The  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares rose 0.4 percent this week as
overseas funds bought $1.3 billion more shares than they sold
through yesterday, exchange data show. A U.S. report today may
show employers boosted payrolls in January by 140,000 workers
and the jobless rate held at an almost three-year low of 8.5
percent, according to median estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “The won is under consistent appreciation pressure with
global economy data improving a lot and foreign investors
boosting Korean stock purchases,” said Hwang Sun Min, a Seoul-
based currency trader at Kookmin Bank.  The won appreciated 0.5 percent this week to 1,118.07 per
dollar in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
little changed today after touching 1,115.70, the strongest
level since Nov. 9.  The one-year currency swap rate, the rate to exchange
payments in won with those in the dollar, rose to 2.51 percent
today, the highest since April, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A Chinese manufacturing index rose faster in January than
the median estimate in a separate survey, while a U.S. gauge
climbed to a seven-month high, reports showed this week.  Bonds rose before policy makers meet to review borrowing
costs next week. The  Bank of Korea  will hold its benchmark rate
at 3.25 percent on Feb. 9, according to 12 of 13 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg News. One predicts a cut to 3 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent debt due
September 2016 fell two basis points this week, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.49 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show. The rate was unchanged today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
