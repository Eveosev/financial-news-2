Ngong Ping 360 Ltd., the  Hong Kong 
cable car operator controlled by  MTR Corp (66) , will suspend services
for two months to replace parts and conduct maintenance
following a malfunction that stranded about 800 passengers.  Ngong Ping will replace all its bullwheel bearings after an
investigation found irregular wear on one, the operator said in
a  statement  posted on its official website today.  The cable car service was halted for as long as two hours
last month, stranding passengers, because of “slight
vibrations” from one of the bearings. The service provides
access to the world’s tallest outdoor seated bronze Buddha
statue on Hong Kong’s Lantau island.  To contact the reporter on this story:
