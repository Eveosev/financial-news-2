Bumi Plc (BUMI) , the coal producer listed in
 London  by  Nathaniel Rothschild , said shareholder Borneo Bumi
Energi & Metal Ltd. called a meeting as it seeks to remove
Rothschild and Chief Executive Officer Ari Hudaya.  The shareholder is also proposing to oust fellow founder
 James Campbell , a former  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  executive, Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Beckham and directors Badung Tariono
and Amir Sambodo at the meeting, a statement today shows.  It wants to appoint Indra Bakrie and Samin Tan as chairmen.
Tan is president director of PT Borneo Lumbung Energi & Metal,
which bought a stake in Bumi last month. It wants Nalinkant Amratlal Rathod named CEO, Scott Merrillees CFO, and Jean-Marc
Mizrahi, Alexander Ramlie, Michael Lucente and Graham Holdaway
as directors.  Bumi (BUMI)  fell 4.5 percent to 850 pence in London trading, the
biggest one-day decline in three months.  Rothschild, currently a Bumi Plc co-chairman, said last
month he had mended relations with Bakrie, whose family are the
equal-biggest shareholders with PT Borneo. Ties were frayed
after Rothschild made public a letter to CEO Hudaya calling for
a “radical cleaning up” of Bakrie’s PT  Bumi Resources. (BUMI)   Billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s EN+ Group said yesterday
Rothschild had resigned from its board “to concentrate on his
principal investing activities including the two public
companies that he founded: Bumi Plc and  Genel Energy Plc (GENL) , where
he has significant ownership positions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
