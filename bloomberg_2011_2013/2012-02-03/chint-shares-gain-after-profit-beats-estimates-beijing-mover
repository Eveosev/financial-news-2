Zhejiang Chint Electrics Co. (601877) , a
Chinese maker of power transmission and solar power equipment,
rose the most in more than a month in  Shanghai  after it reported
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  jumped as much as 5.95 percent to 14.59 yuan and
closed up 4.9 percent at 14.45 yuan in Shanghai, the highest
level since Dec. 1.  China ’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index
gained 0.8 percent.  Chint Electronics, based in eastern China’s Zhejiang
province, said late yesterday that 2011 net income increased
27.8 percent to 816.7 million yuan ($129.6 million). That
exceeded the 773 million yuan  median estimate  of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The company did a nice job in controlling costs in the
fourth quarter and managed to keep profit growth on pace with
revenue increases,” Yao Wei, a Beijing-based analyst at Founder
Securities Ltd., said by telephone today. “The company may
still manage about 20 percent growth in 2012 profit as long as
it can effectively control costs,” said Yao, who rates the
shares “add.”  Revenue increased 31 percent last year to 8.3 billion yuan,
the company said in a filing to Shanghai’s stock exchange after
the close of markets yesterday.  Chint Electronics, which listed shares in Shanghai in
January 2010, fell 45.3 percent last year, compared with a 21.7
percent drop for the  Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)  This year, the
stock has gained 10 percent as the index rose 6 percent.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
