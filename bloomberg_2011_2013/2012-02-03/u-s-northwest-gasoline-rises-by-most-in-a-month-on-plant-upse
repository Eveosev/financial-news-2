Gasoline in the U.S. Northwest
strengthened for the first time in seven days as  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) 
started a unit at the  Anacortes (TEANCRUD)  refinery in Washington state
after an equipment malfunction.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland, Oregon (MOGHD87P) ,
strengthened 2.25 cents to a discount of 17.5 cents against
gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
4:14 p.m. East Coast time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the largest rise for the fuel since Jan. 3.  A unit at the 125,000-barrel-a-day Anacortes refinery shut
after an equipment malfunction yesterday, Tina Barbee, a Tesoro
spokeswoman at the company’s headquarters in  San Antonio , said
in an e-mail. She said the unit is being restarted and the
company expects to meet all supply commitments.  Portland  gasoline dropped 4.75 cents yesterday to a
discount of 19.75 cents, the lowest level since Jan. 17, 2008.  Carbob in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  rose 3 cents to a premium of 12.5
cents versus gasoline futures, the highest level in three weeks.
The same fuel in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  fell 2.25 cents to a discount of
1.5 cents against futures.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  climbed
0.5 cent to 1.5 cents above Nymex heating oil futures.  San
Francisco  CARB diesel rose 2.38 cents to reach parity with
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
