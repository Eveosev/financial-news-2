Canadian natural gas rose after a
report showed that the number of rigs drilling for the fuel in
the U.S. slumped to a 26-month low.  Alberta  gas gained 0.2 percent. Prices recovered from an
earlier decline after  Baker Hughes Inc. (BAKEGAS)  said the rig total fell
32 to 745, the lowest level since Nov. 20, 2009.  “U.S. gas rig counts are now falling sharply,” said
Stephen Smith, an energy analyst and president of Stephen Smith
Energy Associates in Natchez,  Mississippi . “I doubt gas
production growth will flatten to zero before late this year.”  Alberta gas for March delivery rose 0.5 cent to C$2.16 a
gigajoule ($2.06 per million British thermal units) at 3:40 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
lost 0.8 percent this week.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 5.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $2.499 per
million Btu. The futures have declined 6.7 percent this week.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago  rose
10.7 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.6042 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can carry
1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 9.97 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.4413,
according to ICE. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was up 9 cents to $2.5584.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 350 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.38 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.23 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 504 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.94 billion cubic feet today, or 79 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.02
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
