Heavy snowfall in  Rome  today shut
schools, disrupted traffic, forced the cancellation of a Serie A
soccer match and prompted closures of the Coliseum and the ruins
of the Roman Forum.  Around 40 centimeters (16 inches) of snow settled in some
of Rome’s higher-lying outskirts, Major Gianni Alemanno said in
an interview on state-run RAI television today. City offices and
schools were closed for the day, according to his website, and a
match set for tomorrow between AS Roma and  Inter Milan  at Rome’s
Stadio Olimpico was rescheduled for Feb. 5.  The blast of snow in the Italian capital comes after an
unusually dry winter. Heavy snow has fallen over much of  Italy 
this week, causing severe disruption to train and road travel in
the central and northern regions of Tuscany, Umbria, Emilia
Romagna, Lombardy and Piedmont.  Dozens of trains were canceled or delayed today, according
to state-run railway Ferrovie dello Stato SpA’s website. Flights
were operating normally from Rome’s two main airports, according
to the website of  Aeroporti di Roma SpA , which operates them.  To contact the reporters on this story:
