Banks in Slovenia are unwilling to
expand lending even as they benefit from financing from the
 European Central Bank , the government forecasting institute
said.  “Slovenian banks’ liabilities toward the euro system
increased in December by 900 million euros ($1.18 billion),”
the government’s economic institute said in an e-mailed
statement today. “But this won’t increase the credit activity
since banks have deposited these funds with the ECB as they
prepare to repay about 4 billion euros in 2012.”  Banks operating in Slovenia, including  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  and
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , have repaid 1.7 billion euros
of loans and deposits until the end of November, or 40 percent
more than in the same period a year earlier, the institute said.  Slovenian lenders’ reluctance to lend may further damage
the economy, which is sliding into recession as austerity
measures in  Europe  sap demand for its exports. The institute is
forecasting the export-led economy will expand 0.2 percent this
year, while the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
sees a 1.1 percent contraction in 2012.  State-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and  Nova Kreditna
Banka Maribor d.d. , the country’s two biggest lenders, will
probably report further losses for last year as the faltering
economy pushes more companies into bankruptcies and forces them
to increase bad-loan reserves.  The liquidity of the Slovenian banking system has improved
since December, when the ECB started to offer three-year loans
to lender, central bank Governor Marko Kranjec said on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
