Gunvor Group Ltd., the global
commodity trader part-owned by Russian billionaire  Gennady Timchenko , has no plans to acquire  OAO Kuzbassrazrezugol ,
Russia’s second-largest producer of coal for power stations.  Gunvor hasn’t been in talks with  Kuzbassrazrezugol (KZRU) , Anton
Kurevin, a Moscow-based spokesman for Gunvor, said in an e-
mailed response to questions today.  Gunvor is completing the previously announced acquisition
of the Kolmar coal project in eastern Siberia and is not
considering any further coal purchases, he said.  Andrei Bokarev, chairman and co-owner of Kuzbassrazrezugol,
couldn’t be reached for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
