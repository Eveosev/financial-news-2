Euro-area central banks may be
prepared to take losses on the Greek bonds they hold that aren’t
part of the  European Central Bank ’s asset-purchase program, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified “euro
sources.”  The newspaper reported that a number of euro-area
governments are in favor of involving the ECB’s bond holdings in
a deal to reduce  Greece ’s debt load. While central bankers
haven’t yet reached agreement on such a move, there is a growing
consensus that bonds acquired for investment portfolios could be
used, the FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
