Mexico ’s peso rose to a four-month
high after U.S. payrolls climbed more than forecast in January
and the jobless rate unexpectedly fell, boosting confidence in
the world’s biggest economy.  The peso rose 1.1 percent to 12.6596 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close in Mexico City, from 12.8013 yesterday. It was the
strongest closing level since Sept. 8. The currency has jumped
10.1 percent this year, the most among major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It gained 2 percent this week.  The U.S. jobless rate fell to the lowest in three years.
The 243,000 increase in payrolls was the most since April and
exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor
Department figures showed in  Washington . The  unemployment rate 
dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since February 2009.  “For Mexico it’s very important,”  Eduardo Suarez , a
senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital Inc., said by phone
from Toronto. “The signal is supportive, and it’s consistent
with the data that we’re seeing,” which “has been fairly
strong in both Mexico and the U.S.”  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.32
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the securities fell 0.68 centavo to 132.34 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
