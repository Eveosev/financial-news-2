Texas Rangers outfielder  Josh Hamilton  was seen drinking in a Dallas bar, the four-time Major
League Baseball All-Star’s second relapse in three years in
fighting alcohol addiction, the Dallas Morning News reported.  The 30-year-old Hamilton, who was suspended for more than
three years early in his career for alcohol and drug abuse,
drank on Jan. 30 at Sherlock’s Pub & Grill, the newspaper
 reported yesterday  citing unidentified people familiar with the
episode. The American League Most Valuable Player in 2010,
Hamilton has said that he has been sober since 2005.  Rangers spokesman John Blake said in an e-mail that the
team would hold a press conference today and have no prior
comment.  Hamilton, who submits to drug tests three times a week,
acknowledged drinking in a bar in Tempe,  Arizona , in January
2009.  Hamilton’s teammates, in support of his quest for sobriety,
have celebrated their American League championships the last two
seasons with ginger ale instead of the traditional champagne.
Rangers second baseman  Ian Kinsler  appeared at Sherlock’s in
what appeared to be an attempt to convince Hamilton to return
home, the Morning News said.  A career .308 hitter, Hamilton last year hit 25 home runs
with 94 runs batted in. He has been named an All-Star in each of
his last four seasons, all with the Rangers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
