OAO Polyus Gold (PLZL)  surged the most in
more than three years as investors bet its London-listed parent
will make a buyout offer.  Polyus jumped 27 percent today in Moscow to 1,299 rubles as
of 1:19 p.m., the strongest advance since October 2008. The
Russian company continues to trade in Moscow after 95 percent of
its shareholders swapped stock for shares in  Polyus Gold
International Ltd. (PLGL)  last year.  “The only possible driver for the stock is investor
expectations of a buyout offer to OAO Polyus Gold minorities for
cash or stock,” Dmitry Smolin, an analyst at UralSib Capital,
said today. The company is “basically Moscow leftovers of
London-listed Polyus International.”  Anton Arens, a spokesman for Polyus Gold International,
declined to comment. Polyus depositary receipts traded 3 percent
higher in  London  at $3.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
