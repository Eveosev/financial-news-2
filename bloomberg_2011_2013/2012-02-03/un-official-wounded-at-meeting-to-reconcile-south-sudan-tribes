A United Nations official was wounded
while trying to mediate an end to fighting between two ethnic
groups in  South Sudan ’s Warrap state that killed 78 people,
mostly women and children, and wounded 72, the UN said.  A team of UN officials had to be evacuated after they came
under fire during the meeting on Feb. 1 in the adjacent Unity
state, Lise Grande, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator for South
Sudan, told reporters yesterday from the capital, Juba.  The wounded UN official is “fine,” Grande said, adding
that the UN will continue to support reconciliation efforts in
the wake of the attack.  More than 70,000 head of cattle were stolen during the
attack last week, leaving about 40,000 people without a
livelihood, Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights, said today in an e-mailed
statement from Geneva.  To contact the reporter on this story:
