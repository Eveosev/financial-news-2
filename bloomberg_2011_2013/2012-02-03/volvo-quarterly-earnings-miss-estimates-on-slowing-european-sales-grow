Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, stuck to its estimates for the North American and
European heavy-vehicle markets this year as sales growth helped
fourth-quarter operating profit increase 26 percent.  Industrywide sales in 2012 will total 220,000 trucks in
 Europe  and 250,000 in  North America , the Gothenburg, Sweden-
based manufacturer said today in a  statement . Fourth-quarter
earnings before interest and taxes rose to 6.96 billion kronor
($1.03 billion) from 5.52 billion kronor a year earlier. Revenue
increased 18 percent to 86.5 billion kronor, and the operating
margin was 8 percent of sales.  Chief Executive Officer Olof Persson, who took his post on
Sept. 1 after running Volvo’s construction-equipment business
for almost three years, is targeting operating margins at the
top of the heavy-equipment industry, shifting focus to
profitability from sales growth. Volvo is scaling back
manufacturing at its Renault Trucks unit in  France  in response
to an expected decline in European demand.  The company has “a diversified portfolio of products and
geographic sales mix that will help them be one of the winners
in the truck and construction industries in 2012,” Morten Imsgard, an analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa,  Denmark , with an
“overweight” recommendation on Volvo stock, said by phone.  Stock Rises  Volvo  rose  as much as 2.2 percent to 92.75 kronor and was
trading up 1.6 percent at 1:05 p.m. in Stockholm. The stock has
gained 22 percent this year, valuing the company at 196.4
billion kronor.  Volvo has no further plans to cut production or jobs after
scaling back manufacturing and not extending the contracts for
hundreds of temporary workers in  Sweden  and at its Renault
Trucks unit in France in recent months, Persson said.  “Right now, we have a good balance between production and
demand throughout the system, including in the Europe or U.S.,”
Persson said in an interview today in Stockholm. “We see now
that we can handle upturns and downturns in a pretty good way.”  Volvo’s truck-market estimates would amount to a 9.2
percent contraction for Europe, based on the 242,400 vehicles
that Volvo said were sold industrywide in the region in 2011,
and a 16 percent increase in North America from last year’s
216,000 deliveries.  Demand for trucks in Europe declined in the third quarter
and now seemed to have stabilized, Persson said.  Net Income Jumps  Fourth-quarter net income  jumped  46 percent to 4.72 billion
kronor. Full-year profit rose 63 percent to 17.8 billion kronor
as sales gained 17 percent to 310.4 billion kronor and operating
profit increased 49 percent to 26.9 billion kronor.  A 7 percent decline in Volvo’s fourth-quarter truck orders
was led by drops of 24 percent in Europe and 18 percent in  South
America . The order total of 57,704 trucks was less than the
59,000 vehicles that Sydbank’s Imsgard said he had expected. The
8.6 percent operating margin at the trucks unit also missed his
estimate of 9.2 percent.  Swedish truckmaker  Scania AB (SCVB) , which is cutting production
in Europe and  Latin America , reported fourth-quarter net income
of 2.13 billion kronor on Feb. 1, missing analysts’ estimates as
sales growth slowed. Stuttgart, Germany-based  Daimler AG (DAI) , the
world’s largest truckmaker, will publish figures on Feb. 9, and
Munich-based  MAN SE (MAN)  is scheduled to report results Feb. 14.  Operating profit at Volvo’s construction-equipment
division, its biggest business after trucks, fell 6.2 percent in
the quarter to 1.65 billion kronor.  China ’s construction market
contracted 13 percent from September through November, in
contrast to a 9 percent global expansion, driven by measures the
country’s government took to curb inflation, Volvo said.  Earnings at the aero division, which makes plane engines,
fell 46 percent to 151 million kronor as sales increased 1.1
percent to 1.87 billion kronor. Efforts to dispose of the unit
are “continuing,” Persson said, declining to give details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
