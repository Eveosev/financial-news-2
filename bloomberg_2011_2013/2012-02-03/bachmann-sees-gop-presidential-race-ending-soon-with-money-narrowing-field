Former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann will endorse  Mitt Romney  for the Republican nomination
tomorrow, a Romney campaign official said.  Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman who dropped out of the
presidential race on Jan. 4 after finishing sixth in the Iowa
caucuses, will deliver the endorsement as Romney campaigns in
Virginia, said the official who wasn’t authorized to make a
public announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.  Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, is his party’s
presumptive nominee with only Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas
left in the race. Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich exited
the race today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
