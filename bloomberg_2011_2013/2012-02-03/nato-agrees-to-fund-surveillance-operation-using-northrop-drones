NATO broke a 19-year logjam and
agreed to jointly fund operations of an airborne ground-
surveillance system including five  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  Global
Hawk drones.  The 28-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved a
plan this week for all members to pay for support and
operations, according to a statement today on the alliance’s
website.  The project has been a NATO priority for President  Barack Obama  and U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta . Thirteen member
nations, including Germany, Italy and Romania, agreed to buy the
system in 2009 after years of discussion. Falls Church,
Virginia-based Northrop is the prime contractor.  Panetta has said he considers the project an example of
what NATO calls “smart defense,” in which the allies pool
resources to upgrade capabilities and fill gaps. He urged his
counterparts in NATO during meetings this week in Brussels to
expand such pooling and sharing arrangements as they seek more
efficient ways to ensure security amid defense budget cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
