nations and the “long tradition of standing shoulder-to-
shoulder beside each other in defense of our liberties and
shared values,” the administration said in a statement.  Obama and Cameron will discuss the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and G-8 summits scheduled for later in the year in
 Chicago , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
