Twitter Inc. said it plans to hire
Shailesh Rao, who had been leading  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s display-
advertising sales in Asia.  Rao will join Twitter, the microblogging service with more
than 100 million users, later this year to work on the
advertising side of the business,  Matt Graves , a spokesman for
the San Francisco-based company, said today by telephone. A
Google spokesman, Jordan Newman, said Rao had left the company.  Twitter is trying to bolster its revenue after announcing
an advertising platform for the U.S. in 2010 and a global ad
push in 2011. Ad revenue at the closely held company is set to
rise to $540 million in 2014 from $139.5 million in 2011,
according to estimates by New York-based  EMarketer .  Before leading Google display-ad sales in  Asia , Rao had
served as managing director for the company’s business in India
and once worked as a director in charge of local search and new
content partnerships worldwide. Rao had been at banking-software
company Yodlee Inc. before joining Mountain View California-
based Google, owner of the most popular Internet search engine.  Google rose 1.9 percent to $596.33 at the close of New York
trading. The shares have fallen 7.7 percent this year.  -- Editors: Romaine Bostick, Niamh Ring  To contact the reporters on this story:
