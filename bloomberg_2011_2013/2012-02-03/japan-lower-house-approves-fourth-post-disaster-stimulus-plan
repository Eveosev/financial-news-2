Japan ’s lower house of parliament
approved Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s 2.5 trillion yen ($32.8
billion) recovery package from last year’s earthquake and
nuclear disaster.  The stimulus includes 741 billion yen in aid for small and
medium-sized companies to cope with the yen’s appreciation and
300 billion yen to subsidize purchases of low-emission cars. The
package will be financed without issuing new  government bonds .  The extra budget is the fourth since the March 11
earthquake and tsunami left nearly 20,000 dead or missing and
causing the world’s biggest nuclear crisis since the 1986
Chernobyl disaster. The previous three stimulus plans totaled 18
trillion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
