OMV Petrom SA (SNP) ,  Romania ’s largest oil
company, said fourth-quarter oil and natural-gas production rose
1.1 percent from the previous three months.  Output grew to 186,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from
184,000 in the third quarter as its new Totea field in southwest
Romania was put into production and delivered approximately
1,500 barrels a day, Petrom’s majority owner  OMV AG (OMV) , based in
Vienna, said today in a statement.  Gas sales volumes fell 9 percent in the fourth quarter to
1.44 billion cubic meters from 1.58 billion cubic meters in the
same period of 2010 as a warm weather lowered winter demand from
industrial consumers, according to the statement.  Petrom will delay the start of full commercial operations
at its Brazi gas-fired power plant to the second half of the
year, after “final tests were interrupted due to external
technical factors,” OMV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
