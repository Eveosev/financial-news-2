Malaysia’s ringgit advanced for a
fifth week, the longest winning streak since 2010, as economists
predict that growth in factory output will hold in December.  Industrial production  rose 1.8 percent, the same pace in
November, according to the median estimate of 10 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before government data due on Feb. 9. The
currency gained for a fourth day as economists forecast U.S.
employers added fewer workers to their payrolls in January from
a month earlier.  “The market will keep a close watch on the employment data
from the U.S.,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at Bangkok
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The ringgit could continue to
strengthen on portfolio fund inflows.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.1 percent today to 3.0135 per
dollar as of 4:25 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, taking gains this week
to 0.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas investors bought Malaysian stocks for a fourth
straight month in January, according to data on the  Kuala Lumpur 
stock exchange’s website. Foreign funds purchased a net 200
million ringgit ($66 million) of shares last month, yesterday’s
data showed.  The currency has risen 5.1 percent this year, the second-
best among  Asia ’s 11 most-used currencies. Overseas investors
 raised  their ownership of ringgit-denominated debt by 36 percent
from a year earlier to 164.5 billion ringgit ($54.4 billion) in
2011,  Bank Negara Malaysia  said on its website this week.  Employers in the U.S. probably added 140,000 workers last
month after hiring 200,000 in December, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Malaysia’s three-year government bonds rose for a second
week. The yield on the 3.434 percent notes due August 2014
declined five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.92
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate increased one
basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
