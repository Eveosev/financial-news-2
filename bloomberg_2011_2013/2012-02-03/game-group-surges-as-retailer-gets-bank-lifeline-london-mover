Game Group Plc (GMG) , the U.K.’s biggest
independent video-games retailer, rose as much as 48 percent in
London trading after reaching a deal with lenders to stay in
business and forecasting a smaller-than-estimated annual loss.  Banks led by  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  have agreed
to a revision of lending provisions that will allow the company
to continue operating, Basingstoke, England-based Game Group
said today in a statement.  Under the amended terms, the company will “operate within
lower limits of its existing facilities than was previously
available,” according to Game Group, which had  net debt  of 91
million pounds ($144 million) as of July 31.  The  shares,  which reached a record of 300 pence in May
2008, were up 24 percent at 6.61 pence as of 8:44 a.m. They fell
to the lowest since 1989 last month after the company reported a
slump in holiday sales and said it may not meet some covenants.  “We’re pleased to reach agreement with our lenders, but
should be under no illusions about the challenges in our market
or the hard work required to deliver our strategic plan,” Chief
Executive Officer Ian Shepherd said in the statement.  Game Group said its pretax loss for the year ended Jan. 31
was about 18 million pounds, excluding non-recurring item. The
average estimate of nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg was for
a loss on that basis of 23.7 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
