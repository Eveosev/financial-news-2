Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) , a
London-listed oil and natural gas explorer, said that the
transfer of the company’s interest in the Hassi Ba Hamou permit
in Algeria has advanced.  All required documentation has been executed and all
government approvals obtained for the transfer of the right,
title and interest for no consideration, Gulf Keystone said in a
statement. The company is giving the interest to the  BG Group
Plc (BG/) , the operator, and Sonatrach Group, Algeria’s state-run
energy company.  Gulf Keystone is pulling out of the north African nation to
focus on the Kurdistan region of  Iraq , home to about 40 percent
of the country’s 115 billion barrels of reserves. Gulf Keystone
has announced the discovery of as much as 10 billion barrels of
oil in the Shaikan field.  “We are pleased that with the HBH transfer we have made
good progress towards achieving our goal of a gradual strategic
exit from  Algeria ,” Gulf Keystone chief executive officer Todd Kozel said in the statement. “ We are firmly focused on our
operations spanning four exploration blocks in the Kurdistan
region of Iraq.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
