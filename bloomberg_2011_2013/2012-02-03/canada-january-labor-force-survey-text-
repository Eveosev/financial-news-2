Following is the text of
 Canada 's labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Employment was virtually unchanged in January, and the
unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage points to 7.6%
as more people searched for work. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment rose by 129,000 (+0.7%), with most of
the growth occurring in the first six months of this
period.  Employment  Both full-time and part-time employment were
essentially unchanged in January. Compared with 12 months
earlier, the number of full-time workers was up 1.2%
(+170,000), while the number of part-time workers declined
1.2% (-41,000). At the same time, the total number of
hours worked grew 1.4%, with all of the increase in the
first half of the period.  Employment decreased in Prince  Edward Island  in January
and was little changed in the other provinces.  Employment increased in educational services;
information, culture and recreation; and in "other
services", such as personal and household services. There
were declines, however, in professional, scientific and
technical services; and in finance, insurance, real estate
and leasing.  The number of employees increased by 39,000 in January,
with the gains shared between private and public sector
workers. At the same time, the number of self-employed
fell by 37,000. Compared with 12 months earlier, all of
the employment gains have been among private sector
employees (+1.3%), while both self-employment and public
sector employment were virtually unchanged.  Employment increased in January among women aged 55 and
over and was little changed for the other demographic age
groups.  Unemployment rate  Industry perspective  In January, employment in education increased by
23,000. At the same time, employment increased by 19,000
in information, culture and recreation.  Employment in "other services" rose by 14,000, bringing
growth over the past 12 months to 5.5% (+42,000), one of
the highest rates of all industries.  There were fewer people employed in January in
professional, scientific and technical services, down
45,000. Despite this decline, employment in the industry
remained 23,000 (+1.8%) above the level of 12 months
earlier.  Employment in finance, insurance, real estate and
leasing fell for the fifth consecutive month, down 23,000
in January. This left employment in the industry 50,000 
(-4.6%) below its level of January 2011.  While employment in natural resources was little
changed in January, it has posted the highest 12-month
rate of growth of all industries, up 8.5% or 28,000 since
January 2011.  Employment in January edged up in manufacturing,
bringing gains over the last two months to 36,000. Despite
the recent increase, the number of factory workers was
down 2.5% (-44,000) from the level of 12 months earlier.  Provincial summary  Employment in  Quebec  edged up in January and the
 unemployment rate  fell 0.3 percentage points to 8.4%.
Compared with January 2011, employment in the province was
down 1.1% (-45,000) as a result of losses in the final
quarter of 2011.  While employment in  Alberta  was little changed in
January, the province posted the highest growth rate
(+3.9% or +80,000) compared with 12 months earlier. The
unemployment rate, at 4.9%, remained the lowest among all
provinces.  In Ontario, employment was little changed in January.
However, an increase in the number of people searching for
work pushed the unemployment rate up 0.4 percentage points
to 8.1%. In the 12 months to January 2012, employment in
the province increased 0.7% (+44,000), with all the growth
occurring in the first half of the period.  Employment in Prince Edward Island fell by 1,000 and
the unemployment rate rose by one percentage point to
12.2%.  More women aged 55 and over working  Employment increased by 19,000 in January among women
aged 55 and over. Employment for this age group grew 3.5%
(+49,000) compared with 12 months earlier, in large part a
result of the aging of the population.  Men aged 55 and over saw little employment change in
January. Their 12-month employment growth rate of 3.1%
(+52,000) was entirely the result of the aging population.  Among people aged 25 to 54, there was little employment
change in January. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment for this age group was up 0.5% (+59,000).  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 edged down for
the fourth consecutive month. As a result, youth
employment was 31,000 (-1.2%) below its level in January
2011 and the unemployment rate was 14.5%.  Note to readers  Every January, seasonally adjusted estimates from the
Labour Force Survey (LFS) are revised using the latest
seasonal factors. Seasonally adjusted series have been
revised going back three years, starting with January
2009. These series became available on CANSIM on January
27, 2012 (tables 282-0087 to 282-0094, 282-0100, 282-0116
and 282-0117) and are now available for download free of
charge.  The LFS estimates are based on a sample, and are
therefore subject to sampling variability. Estimates for
smaller geographic areas or industries will have more
variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates, and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the "Data quality" section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations. For more
information on seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal
adjustment and identifying economic trends.  Statistics Canada  is moving to one release time, 8:30
a.m., for all data releases in The Daily. This will mean a
change in the release time for the LFS, which is currently
7:00 a.m. This change will be implemented with the release
of LFS data on April 5, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
