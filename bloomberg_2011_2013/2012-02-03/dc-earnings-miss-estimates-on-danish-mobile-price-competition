TDC A/S (TDC) , Denmark’s biggest phone
company, reported fourth-quarter earnings that missed analyst
estimates on price erosion in the country’s mobile market.  Profit from continuing operations gained 12 percent to 704
million kroner ($124 million), Copenhagen-based TDC said today
in a statement. That trailed the average estimate of 737 million
kroner from eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales declined
1 percent to 6.69 billion kroner, compared with 6.63 billion
kroner predicted by analysts.  Apax Partners LLP, Blackstone Group LP, KKR & Co., Permira
Advisers LLP and Providence Equity Partners Inc. are free to
sell their combined 59.1 percent stake after the expiration of a
lockup period following a 2010 share sale. Competitors are
loading more minutes and megabytes into their service offerings
for the same price, and TDC is choosing to enhance services
rather than match promotions, Chief Executive Officer Henrik
Poulsen said in an interview.  Competitive Market  “The Danish market remains quite competitive,” Poulsen
said. “It is still questionable whether the total profit pool
is big enough in this market to allow for four parallel networks
to be built out going forward.”  The company forecast flat to declining earnings as
customers cut their use of voice minutes and continue to shop
for better deals. TDC expects 2012 revenue of 26 billion kroner
to 26.5 billion kroner, compared with 26.3 billion kroner last
year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and pension income are predicted to be 10.3 billion
kroner to 10.5 billion kroner, compared with 10.5 billion kroner
in 2011.  The private equity owners sold about 29 percent of the
company to the public in December 2010.  Poulsen said he didn’t know the private equity owners’
plans.  “That’s entirely a decision for them to make and we are
not and should not be part of the process,” he said.  TDC shares  were little changed at 45.18 kroner at 1:15 p.m.
in Copenhagen. The stock has dropped 4.6 percent in the last six
months.  The Danish company also said it’s initiating a share
buyback program in 2012 for as much as 750 million kroner.  TDC  bought  Onfone ApS in May for 313 million kroner,
removing a competitor that drove down monthly bills on the
cheapest contracts by as much as 50 percent. Rivals  Telenor ASA (TEL) 
and  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  announced a network-sharing agreement soon
afterward.  To contact the reporter on this story:
