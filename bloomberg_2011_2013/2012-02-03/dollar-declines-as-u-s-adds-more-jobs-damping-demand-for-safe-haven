The dollar fell against the euro
after U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast in January,
damping demand for the safety of the greenback.  Nonfarm payrolls rose by 243,000, after increasing by
200,000 in December, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . The median of 89 economists in a Bloomberg Survey
had forecast an addition of 140,000. The  unemployment rate  fell
to 8.3 percent.  “A positive number will arouse demand for riskier assets
and cause movement away from the dollar,”  Joe Manimbo , a market
analyst in Washington at Western Union Business Solutions, a
unit of Western Union Co., said before the release.  The dollar dropped 0.3 percent to $1.3178 per euro at 8:32
a.m. in New York. It rose 0.2 percent to 76.37 yen.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, was little changed at 78.977.  At a meeting last month, the  Federal Reserve  pledged to
keep its interest rate near zero until late 2014. The
accommodative policy tends to drive investors away from the
dollar as they seek higher yields elsewhere.  Three Fed officials said rates should be increased in 2012,
three said 2013, five said 2014, four said 2015 and two said
2016.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday the economy has
shown signs of improvement while remaining vulnerable to shocks,
and he called on lawmakers to reduce the long-term U.S. budget
deficit.  ‘Signs of Improvement’  “Fortunately, over the past few months, indicators of
spending, production, and job-market activity have shown some
signs of improvement,” Bernanke said in testimony to the House
Budget Committee in Washington. “The outlook remains uncertain,
however, and close monitoring of economic developments will
remain necessary.”  Data this year have signaled the  U.S. economy  is recovering
at a quickening pace. Manufacturing grew in January at the
fastest pace in seven months, the Institute for Supply
Management reported Feb. 1. Consumer confidence rose last month
to the highest level in almost a year, according to a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index published Jan. 27.  The Dollar Index rose 0.4 percent on Jan. 6, when the Labor
Department reported that payrolls increased by 200,000, more
than the 155,000 forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The gauge
advanced 0.5 percent on Dec. 2, when the unemployment rate
unexpectedly dropped to 8.6 percent, the lowest level since
2009. It was later revised to 8.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
