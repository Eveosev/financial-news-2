Germany  can’t be prosecuted by
private citizens seeking war crimes damages, the  International
Court of Justice  said, rejecting an Italian ruling awarding
compensation to relatives of World War II atrocity victims.  Germany appealed an Italian court decision ordering it to
compensate relatives of people killed in a 1944 Nazi attack,
saying Italy didn’t respect the principle of legal immunity for
states from prosecution by private citizens.  Italy’s Court of Cassation denied “Germany the immunity to
which the court has held that it was entitled under customary
international law,” the United Nations court in The Hague said
in a  statement  today.  Members of a German army division  killed  203 civilian
hostages in Civitella in Val di Chiana, in Tuscany, in June 1944
after resistance fighters attacked four German soldiers. The
Italian Court of Cassation’s 2008 ruling widened a private claim
from relatives against a surviving former German army officer to
apply to the German government.  Germany has already paid reparations under international
treaties with  Italy  and feared “hundreds of additional cases”
may be brought against it, the German government said in its
2008 court filing.  The UN court today also overruled an Italian court decision
ordering Germany to pay compensation to the relatives of the
victims of the Distomo massacre in  Greece  in 1944, in which 218
villagers were killed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
