Nigeria’s naira advanced for a fourth
day, heading for a weekly gain, on increased dollar supply from
 oil companies  to fund operations.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.1
percent to 160.35 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of 12:36
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, compared with yesterday’s
New York close. The naira is up 0.4 percent this week.  Oil company sales “increased supply of dollars” Jide Solanke, an analyst at First Securities Discount House Ltd.,
said by phone from Lagos today. “There is ample supply, more
than demand at the moment.”  The West African nation isn’t under pressure to devalue the
naira again after lowering its band against the dollar last
year, Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said Feb.
1. The bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a
record high for a second consecutive meeting Jan. 31.  Ghana’s cedi was little changed at 1.6852 per dollar,
heading for a weekly decline of 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
