Steve Appleton , the chief executive
officer of semiconductor-maker  Micron Technology Inc. (MU) , died
after crashing an experimental plane in Boise, Idaho. He was 51.  Appleton was flying a private aircraft with a fixed wing
and single engine, said Patty Miller, a spokeswoman for the
Boise airport. Appleton, who was the only fatality, crashed
between two runways at the airport, Miller said.  “Our hearts go out to his wife, Dalynn, his children and
his family during this tragic time,” Boise-based Micron
said in the statement. “Steve’s passion and energy left an
indelible mark on Micron, the Idaho community and the technology
industry at large.”  Appleton was one of the longest-serving CEOs in the
semiconductor industry. He was in the midst of a turnaround
effort at Micron, pushing the company in to a broader range of
products, including mobile-phone devices. The company is the
only producer of computer-memory chips outside of  Asia , even as
rivals such as  Intel Corp . and Texas Instruments Inc. abandoned
that segment of the market to focus on other products.  Last year, Appleton was awarded the Semiconductor Industry
Association’s Robert N. Noyce Award, named after one of the
founders of Intel and the inventor of the integrated circuit.  A Los Angeles native, Appleton flew stunt planes as a
hobby. In 2004, he nearly died in another crash. He also enjoyed
other high-adrenaline activities, including triathlons,
skydiving and motorcycle racing, BusinessWeek reported in the
late 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
