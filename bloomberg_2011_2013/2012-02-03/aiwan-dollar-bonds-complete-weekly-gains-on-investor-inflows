Taiwan ’s dollar and government bonds
completed weekly gains as foreign funds increased holdings of
the island’s assets on optimism the global economy is recovering.  The local dollar had the biggest five-day rally since
January 2011 after overseas investors bought $1.1 billion more
Taiwanese stocks than they sold this week, taking net purchases
for the year to $2.1 billion, according to exchange data.
Reports this week showed manufacturing in the U.S.,  China  and
 Germany  picked up in January, and the island’s jobless rate
dropped to 4.22 percent in December from 4.32 percent the
previous month.  “Buying interest on shorter bonds from foreign investors
is pretty strong,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income
trader at Polaris Securities Co. “The appreciation in the
Taiwan dollar has contributed to a bond rally.”  The Taiwan dollar strengthened 1.5 percent this week to
NT$29.545 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.420 earlier, the strongest
level since Sept. 13. It was little changed today.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
2017 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, this
week to 0.938 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show.
The rate rose one basis point today.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed today at 0.4 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center. It fell one basis point this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
