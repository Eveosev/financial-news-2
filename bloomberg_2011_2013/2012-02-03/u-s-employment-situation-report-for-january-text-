Following is the text of the
January employment report from the Labor Department.  THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION -- JANUARY 2012  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 243,000 in January,
and the unemployment rate decreased to 8.3 percent, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Job growth was
widespread in the private sector, with large employment gains
in professional and business services, leisure and
hospitality, and manufacturing. Government employment changed
little over the month.  Changes to The Employment Situation Data
Establishment survey data have been revised as a result of the
annual benchmarking process and the updating of seasonal
adjustment factors. Also, household survey data for January
2012
reflect updated population estimates.  Household Survey Data  The unemployment rate declined by 0.2 percentage point in
January to 8.3 percent; the rate has fallen by 0.8 point since
August. The number of unemployed persons declined to 12.8
million in January. (See the note and tables B and C for
information about annual population adjustments to the
household survey estimates.)  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men (7.7 percent) and blacks (13.6 percent) declined in
January. The unemployment rates for adult women (7.7 percent),
teenagers (23.2 percent), whites (7.4 percent), and Hispanics
(10.5 percent) were little changed. The jobless rate for
Asians was 6.7 percent, not seasonally adjusted.  In January, the number of job losers and persons who completed
temporary jobs fell to 7.3 million. The number of long-term
unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was little
changed at 5.5 million and accounted for 42.9 percent of the
unemployed.  After accounting for the annual adjustments to the population
controls, the employment-population ratio (58.5 percent) rose
in January, while the civilian  labor force  participation rate
held at 63.7 percent.  The number of persons employed part time for economic reasons,
at 8.2 million, changed little in January. These individuals
were working part time because their hours had been cut back
or because they were unable to find a full-time job.  In January, 2.8 million persons were marginally attached to
the labor force, essentially unchanged from a year earlier.
(The data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were
not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work,
and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They
were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched
for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 1.1 million
discouraged workers in January, little different from a year
earlier. (The data are not seasonally adjusted.) Discouraged
workers are persons not currently looking for work because
they believe no jobs are available for them. The remaining 1.7
million persons marginally attached to the labor force in
January had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the
survey for reasons such as school attendance or family
responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 243,000 in January.
Private-sector employment grew by 257,000, with the largest
employment gains in professional and business services,
leisure and hospitality, and manufacturing. Government
employment was little changed over the month.  Professional and business services continued to add jobs in
January (+70,000). About half of the increase occurred in
employment services (+33,000). Job gains also occurred in
accounting and bookkeeping (+13,000) and in architectural and
engineering services (+7,000).  Over the month, employment in leisure and hospitality
increased by 44,000, primarily in food services and drinking
places (+33,000). Since a recent low in February 2010, food
services has added 487,000 jobs.  In January, health care employment continued to grow
(+31,000). Within the industry, hospitals and ambulatory care
services each added 13,000 jobs.  Wholesale trade employment increased by 14,000 over the month.
Since a recent employment low in May 2010, wholesale trade has
added 144,000 jobs.  Employment in retail trade continued to trend up in January.
Job gains in department stores (+19,000), health and personal
care stores (+7,000), and automobile dealers (+7,000) were
partially offset by losses in clothing and clothing accessory
stores (-14,000). Since an employment trough in December 2009,
retail trade has added 390,000 jobs.  In January, employment in information declined by 13,000,
including a loss of 8,000 jobs in the motion picture and sound
recording industry.  In the goods-producing sector, manufacturing added 50,000
jobs. Nearly all of the increase occurred in durable goods
manufacturing, with job growth in fabricated metal products
(+11,000), machinery (+11,000), and motor vehicles and parts
(+8,000). Durable goods manufacturing has added 418,000 jobs
over the past 2 years.  Employment in construction increased by 21,000 in January,
following a gain of 31,000 in the previous month. Over the
past 2 months, nonresidential specialty trade contractors
added 30,000 jobs.  Mining added 10,000 jobs in January, with most of the gain in
support activities for mining (+8,000). Since a recent low in
October 2009, mining employment has expanded by 172,000.  Government employment changed little in January. Over the past
12 months, the sector has lost 276,000 jobs, with declines in
local government; state government, excluding education; and
the U.S. Postal Service.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls was unchanged in January. The manufacturing workweek
increased by 0.3 hour to 40.9 hours, and factory overtime
increased by 0.1 hour to 3.4 hours. The average workweek for
production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm
payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours.  In January, average hourly earnings for all employees on
private nonfarm payrolls rose by 4 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$23.29. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have
increased by 1.9 percent. In January, average hourly earnings
of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees
edged up by 2 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $19.62.  The change in total nonfarm payroll employment for November
was revised from +100,000 to +157,000, and the change for
December was revised from +200,000 to +203,000. Monthly
revisions result from additional sample reports and the
monthly recalculation of seasonal factors. The annual
benchmark process also contributed to these revisions.  ____________
