Hexagon AB (HEXAB) , the world’s biggest maker
of measuring instruments, jumped to its highest level in six
months in  Stockholm  after U.S. competitor Trimble Navigation
Ltd. forecast higher-than-expected first-quarter profit.  Hexagon  rose  as much as 7.1 kronor, or 5.7 percent, to 131
kronor, and traded at 127.9 kronor as of 12:00 p.m., the highest
level since Aug. 1, and was the biggest gainer on the Bloomberg
Europe Machinery Index, which was up 0.5 percent. That valued
the Stockholm-based company at 45.3 billion kronor ($6.75
billion).  Hexagon, scheduled to report  fourth-quarter earnings  on
Feb. 8, manufactures measuring instruments used in the
construction of roads, bridges, buildings and mines, and
benefits when global construction rises.  “Fourth-quarter results demonstrated the momentum, which
was evident throughout 2011,” Trimble Chief Executive Officer
Steven Berglund said on a conference call yesterday. “This
momentum is carrying us into 2012 and enables us to expect
another strong year, subject to strong conditionality about the
revolution of the euro crisis and its effects on the world
economy.”  Trimble, based in Sunnyvale,  California , reported fourth-
quarter adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents, compared with
the average estimate of 48 cents in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts, and forecasts first-quarter earnings of 61 cents to 63
cents per share, compared with the average estimate of 58 cents.  Berglund said he expected 2012 to be a better year for
Trimble in  China  and that the market there had shown some signs
of becoming more “stabilized and solidified.”  Hexagon has about 28 percent of its sales in  Asia ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg for full-year 2010
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
