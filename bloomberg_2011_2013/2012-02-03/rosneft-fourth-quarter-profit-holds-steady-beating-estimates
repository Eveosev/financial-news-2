OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, held profit little changed in the fourth quarter, even
as it beat estimates and full-year earnings reached a record.  Net income was $2.99 billion, compared with $3 billion a
year earlier, according to Rosneft’s financial statements. That
beat an average estimate of $2.73 billion from 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Rosneft is the first Russian  oil company  to report fourth-
quarter results. Output rose 2.4 million barrels a day of crude
in the period, or almost a quarter of the country’s world-
leading production, which rose to a post-Soviet record last
year. Urals, the country’s benchmark export blend, averaged
$108.63 in the quarter, 27 percent higher than a year earlier,
according to Rosneft.  Revenue rose 38 percent to $24 billion, Rosneft said.  “Lower profits come from the lost tax holiday at Vankor
and export duties rising with  oil prices ,” Alexander Kirevnin,
an oil and gas analyst at VTB Capital, said by phone before the
results. The results are likely to “set a trend” for other
Russian oil producers’ results, the bank said earlier.  Tax holidays for Vankor, Russia’s largest new oil
development, expired in the third quarter. Rosneft plans to
produce over 500,000 barrels a day at the northern field at
peak.  Rosneft paid $7.14 billion in  customs duties  in the fourth
quarter compared with $4.59 billion a year earlier, according to
the statements.  Full-year net rose 20 percent to $12.5 billion, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
climbed 15 percent to $22 billion.  Net debt climbed to $15.9 billion, up 13 percent from start
of the quarter and 16 percent from the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
