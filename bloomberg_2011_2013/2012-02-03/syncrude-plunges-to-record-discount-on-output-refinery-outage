Canadian oil discounts plunged as
 Alberta  producers boost production and after BP Plc shut a
gasoline-making unit for unplanned maintenance at an Indiana
refinery, weakening demand.  Syncrude Canada Ltd. increased production by 11 percent in
January from the previous month to 313,200 barrels a day,
Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the largest shareholder in the joint
venture project, said in a statement on its website yesterday.
BP shut a fluid catalytic cracker at the Whiting refinery, a
person familiar with refinery operations said.  The discount for  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  widened to the largest amount
since at least 2006, dropping $5.50 to $13.50 below West Texas
Intermediate at 12:24 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic
oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI weakened $2.75 to
$31 a barrel, the cheapest in more than a year.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI gained 40 cents to $15.30 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
increased $1.60 to $18.85 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI gained $2.15 to $16.90 and
Mars Blend’s rose $1.05 to $13.40.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
strengthened $1 to $13.50 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) 
increased $1 to $13 over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened $1.50 to $4.50 a barrel,
the largest gap in almost a year. Western Refining Inc. will
perform work in early February on a crude unit and fluid
catalytic cracker at the El Paso, Texas, refinery, a person with
knowledge of the plans said Jan. 13. The plant can process
20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day of WTS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
