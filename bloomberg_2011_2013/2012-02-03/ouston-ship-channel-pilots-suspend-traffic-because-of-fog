Maritime pilots resumed some
transport in Houston, the largest U.S. petroleum port, where 40
inbound ships were stalled because fog limited visibility this
morning, the U.S. Coast Guard said.  Maritime pilots began guiding vessels from the port through
the  Houston Ship Channel  at 10 a.m. local time today to clear
dock space, Lance Bradley, a Coast Guard watch supervisor, said
today in an interview. Visibility may remain too poor for two-
way traffic today, so inbound ships may anchor offshore until
tomorrow, he said.  Transit to the ports of Galveston and  Texas City  resumed at
9 a.m. after pilots stopped operations due to fog fog at 10:20
a.m. yesterday, he said.  An advisory for dense fog is in effect for the area until
noon today, according to a notice posted by the  National Weather
Service  on its  website  at 9:48 a.m. Fog banks may persist
through tomorrow, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
