European banks have almost doubled
the amount of loans they are trying to sell to 2.5 trillion
euros ($3.3 trillion) in the past year as they seek to cut
balance sheets, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  “Banks have continued to develop their deleverage
strategies, and have become more transparent in communicating
these to the market,” Richard Thompson, a partner at London-
based PwC, said in today’s report. “Over the past year PwC has
seen an increasing volume of non-core loan portfolio
transactions, a trend that is expected to continue.” Last year
the figure was estimated to be 1.3 trillion euros, PwC said.  While the total amount of bad loans on European banks’
balance sheets has remained stable at about 518 billion euros in
the past year, in countries such as Spain, Greece and Italy
balances have been increasing, offsetting reductions in Germany
and Ireland, PwC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
