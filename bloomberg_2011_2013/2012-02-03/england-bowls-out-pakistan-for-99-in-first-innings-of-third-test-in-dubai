Captain  Andrew Strauss  was unbeaten
on 41 to lead  England  to a 5-run lead at the end of the first
day of the third cricket Test with Pakistan in Dubai.  England finished the day on 104-6 in response to Pakistan’s
innings of 99 all out.  Strauss hit four 4s off 120 balls as England’s other
batsmen continued to struggle. Only Kevin Pietersen, trapped leg
before wicket on 32, and Eoin Morgan, lbw on 10, reached double
digits. At the end of the day, Strauss was batting with  James
Anderson , who was on 3.  Abdur Rehman was 3-23 and Umar Gul was 2-28 for Pakistan,
which has already won the series after victories in the first
two Tests. Saeed Ajmal was 1-40.  In Pakistan’s innings, Anderson and  Stuart Broad  combined
to take seven wickets to restrict Pakistan.  Broad was 4-36, while Anderson was 3-35 as Pakistan
collapsed to 44-7 in the 22nd over. Monty Panesar took two
wickets and Graeme Swann took one while bowling a maiden.  Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat. Six batsman,
including four of the first five, failed to reach 10 before
getting out.  Asad Shafiq led Pakistan with 45 runs in the innings before
being trapped lbw. Five other batsmen were also out lbw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
