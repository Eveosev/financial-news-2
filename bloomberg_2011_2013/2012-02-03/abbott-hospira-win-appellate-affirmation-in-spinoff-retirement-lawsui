Abbott Laboratories and  Hospira Inc. (HSP) 
won a U.S. appeals court ruling upholding a trial court finding
the companies didn’t mislead workers about retirement benefit
levels to induce them to leave Abbott for its Hospira spinoff.  Workers Myla Nauman, Jane Roller and Michael Loughery,
representing a group of 8,000 Abbott workers who moved to
Hospira, claimed the companies falsely promised that employees
who made the switch would see no decrease of their benefits.  Hospira, a maker of intravenous drugs was spun off from the
pharmaceutical company in 2004. The new entity eliminated a
retiree medical benefit program immediately and its pension plan
as of Jan. 1, 2005, according to trial court papers.  “Abbott told employees that Hospira would create its own
benefits plan after the spin and that the Hospira plan could be
entirely different from the Abbott plan,” the Chicago-based
appeals court  said today  in the ruling written by U.S. Circuit
Judge Diane Sykes.  “Those statements were entirely true; nothing in the
record suggests otherwise,” the unanimous three-judge panel
said, upholding the 2010 trial court ruling by U.S. District
Judge Robert W. Gettleman in the same courthouse.  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  is based in  Abbott Park , Illinois. The
spinoff, Hospira, maintains its corporate headquarters in  Lake
Forest , Illinois.  The case is Nauman v. Abbott Laboratories, 10-2272, in the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ( Chicago ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
