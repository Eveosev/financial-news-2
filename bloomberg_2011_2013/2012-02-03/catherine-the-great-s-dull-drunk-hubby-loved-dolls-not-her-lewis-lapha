It was the culmination of the Empress
Elizabeth’s plan to put the right heir on the Russian throne.  Bedecked with diamonds, both wearing white with silver
lace, on Aug. 21, 1745, the bridal couple rode with her in the
state coach from the Winter Garden to the Cathedral of Our Lady
of Kazan.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Peter was slight and sickly. At 17, he still enjoyed
playing with dolls and toy soldiers and showed little interest
in his smart, blue-eyed wife.  Anxious about her wedding night, Catherine had asked her
mother about what might transpire but was reprimanded for
displaying such indecent curiosity. When Peter finally slid into
the bed beside her, he reeked of alcohol and tobacco, laughed
nervously and promptly fell into a deep stupor.  Catherine slept beside him, untouched, for the next nine
years. She began affairs with a series of smart men who advanced
 Russia ’s power and also helped to permanently remove the dimwit
from the throne.  I spoke with Robert Massie, author of “Catherine the
Great: Portrait of a Woman,” on the following topics:  1. Cultivated Princess  2. Husband Deposed  3. Serf Dilemma  4. Big Love: Gregory Potemkin  5. European Culture  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
