Greg Cosell, a senior producer at
NFL Films Inc., predicted in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this
weekend, that the  New York Giants  will defeat the New
England Patriots 27-24 in the Super Bowl on Feb. 5.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome back. We’ll go to  Margaret Carlson  and
 Kate O’Beirne  in a moment, but first, Super Bowl XLVI Sunday
night. We usually interview the greatest NFL impresario and
my high school classmate, the head of NFL Films, Steve
Sabol. Filling in this year is his protégé, who Steve says
is the best pro football analyst, Greg Cosell of NFL Films.  Greg, tell me, Sunday night,  Tom Brady , who is one of
the five greatest quarterbacks of all times, versus  Eli
Manning , who may be on the verge of getting there, who’s got
the edge?  GREG COSELL: That’s a difficult question, Al. Look,
Brady has a legacy that’s already in place. I think that Eli
Manning doesn’t quite have that legacy, but it’s so
interesting to me when you look at quarterbacks what
happens, for instance, if David Tyree doesn’t catch that
ball four years ago. Is Eli Manning’s potential legacy
different?  But I think Eli Manning this year has improved
dramatically as a quarterback, and I think as we enter the
game, right now, he’s playing better football than Tom
Brady.  HUNT: They also have two great receiving corps. Now,
assuming that Gronkowski is healthy, which team has the edge
among receivers?  COSELL: Well, it’s a different receiving corps. If
Gronkowski’s healthy, the Patriots are a two-tight-end-based
offense, which, by the way, is also different from the  Super
Bowl  a number of years ago when they were a three-wide-
receiver-based offense.  The Giants, on the other hand, they do their best work
with three wide receivers on the field, and Victor Cruz, an
undrafted free agent, who’s become a dynamic slot receiver,
and I think that’s a real troublesome element for the
Patriots in this game.  HUNT: Greg,  Tom Coughlin  is a great coach. He’s just
done a fabulous job this year. But Steve taught me that
Belichick is the new Lombardi, a genius. What schemes or
surprises might he have in store Sunday?  COSELL: Well, it’s funny you say that, because I’ve
been just agonizing over how he’s going to handle the three
wide receivers that we just talked about, because they’ve
been playing with Julian Edelman, who’s a college
quarterback, NFL wide receiver, as his slot corner to play
receiver. And I’m just - I can’t get my arms around it, Al.
Is he going with two weeks to prepare? Is Belichick going to
play Julian Edelman in the slot over  Victor Cruz ? I can’t
see that.  So I think Belichick will have something up his sleeve,
maybe something like he did against  Marshall Faulk  in the
Super Bowl, what, 10 years ago, what we call the bull’s-eye
concept, where he tries to take care of Cruz in a specific
way and then he can do other things with the other
receivers. I wouldn’t be surprised to see something like
that.  HUNT: Is there any other key match-up that you’re
looking for on Sunday?  COSELL: Well, I’ll tell you one match-up that I don’t
think will be as big as a lot of people think, and that’s
the Giants’ defensive line versus the Patriots’, because I
think if Gronkowski can go, when you play with two tight
ends, Al, you have way more flexibility with your pass
protection concepts. And therefore, I don’t think the
Giants’ pass rush will be a game-changer the way a lot of
people seem to think.  HUNT: Greg, the Giants, a month ago, they lost to the
Redskins. We know how lowly the Redskins are. What happened?
Why did they come back?  COSELL: Well, I think the Giants defensively have had a
lot of ups and downs. They’ve had issues at the linebacker
position with injuries and new players. Look, they’re
starting in their base defense Chase Blackburn at middle
linebacker, Al. They got him off the street this year, even
though he’d been with them in previous years. So there were
a lot of interchangeable and moving parts for the Giants’
defense, and I think they’ve sort of coalesced as this year
has progressed, and they’re playing pretty good football.  I think their running game is another key factor, very
poor this season, the worst in the NFL by the numbers. The
last four, five weeks, while it’s not been great, it’s been
efficient. It’s been a very good complement to the passing
game.  HUNT: Greg, for the past 10 years, Sudden-Death Sabol
has predicted the winner. Finally, he’s climbed above .500
the last couple of years. What’s the final score Sunday
night?  COSELL: All right, Al, this is the moment of truth. I’m
going to go Giants 27-24.  HUNT: Oh, boy, the New York Giants beating the  New
England Patriots . Greg Cosell, I’ll tell you something, the
biggest compliment I can pay, you are a great substitute for
Steve Sabol. Thank you so much, and we’ll be watching Sunday
night.  COSELL: Thank you, Al. Appreciate it.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY
