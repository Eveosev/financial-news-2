Coffee-bean exports from  Indonesia ’s
main growing regions on southern Sumatra fell 28 percent in
January from a month earlier because of lower output.  Shipments from Lampung, Bengkulu and South Sumatra
provinces, which mostly grow robusta, dropped to 6,306 metric
tons from 8,791.5 tons in December, Ardhy Wijaya, head of
Lampung’s trade office, said by phone today. Sales were 17,957.5
tons in January last year.  Falling supplies from the world’s third-largest grower may
help to support robusta prices, which have declined about 19
percent in  London  in the past year on concern the European debt
crisis may hurt demand of the bitter tasting variety used in
instant drinks.  “Export last month was low because of low output last year,
so we don’t have much carryover stock from last year’s crops,”
Mochtar Lutfie, head of research and development at the Lampung
chapter of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and
Industries, said by phone today.  The three provinces account for as much as 80 percent of
exports and production from Indonesia. The beans were shipped
from Panjang port in Lampung. Vietnam and  Brazil  are the biggest
and second-largest robusta producers.  Robusta futures for March delivery fell 1 percent to $1,800
a ton on the NYSE Liffe in London yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
