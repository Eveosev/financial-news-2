OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  gained in U.S.
trading after controlling  shareholder  AFK Sistema’s Indian
mobile-phone business lost most of its licenses, reducing
concern that MTS may be forced to buy the unit.  American depositary receipts of MTS,  Russia ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, rose 1.4 percent to $17.02 in New York,
advancing 2 percent this week. MTS’s  shares  on Russia’s Micex
Index rose 0.5 percent to 214.23 rubles, or $7.10. One ADR is
equal to two ordinary shares.  Sistema -- which owns 50.82 percent of MTS according to
data compiled by Bloomberg -- will contest a decision made
yesterday by the  Supreme Court  of India revoking 21 of the 22
licenses held by Shyam TeleServices Ltd., which sells mobile-
phone services in  India  under the MTS brand, according to a
Sistema statement today.  The prospect that the Indian company won’t be merged with
MTS represents “a significant reduction of risk for MTS,” said
Konstantin Chernyshev, head of research at UralSib Financial
Corp in Moscow. “MTS is a very good company, however, there has
been a risk of value erosion if the company is forced to buy
Shyam.”  Moscow-based MTS has a history of purchasing assets from
Sistema.  The company acquired CJSC Sistema-Inventure, which owns 29
percent of the Moscow City Telephone Network, for 10.6 billion
rubles ($342 million), according to a Dec. 1  statement  on its
website. As part of the deal, MTS agreed to repay 10.4 billion
rubles of CJSC Sistema’s debt owed to AFK Sistema by the end of
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
