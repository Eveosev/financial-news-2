Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, will write down 4.2 billion kroner ($721
million) on its Indian venture after the government said it will
cancel the wireless licenses the company needs to operate.  The write down on licenses and goodwill will be booked in
the fourth quarter of last year, Telenor said in a statement.  India ’s Supreme Court canceled 122 mobile-phone licenses,
including 22 to Uninor, which Telenor took over from Unitech
Ltd. after the licenses were awarded. Unitech remains a minority
partner. The cancellations become effective after four months,
Telenor said.  “The risk was really obvious that they were going to write
down at least part of the costs they had on the Indian assets
and now they’ve charged all of the goodwill and the capitalized
value of the licenses,” said Christer Roth, an Oslo-based
analyst at DNB. “This is by no means an indication of anything
other than the  supreme court  ruling yesterday. It has no bearing
on whether Telenor will stay or go from India.”  The write downs were expected and priced in yesterday, Roth
said. Telenor was trading down 0.1 percent at 93.60 kroner as of
4:49 p.m. in Oslo, extending a 4.4 percent drop yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
