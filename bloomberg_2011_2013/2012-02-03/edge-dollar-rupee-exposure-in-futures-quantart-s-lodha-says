Samir Lodha, managing director at
QuantArt Market Solutions Ltd. in Mumbai, recommends Indian
corporates use the currency futures market to hedge their dollar
exposure.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  yesterday asked commercial
lenders to “rigorously evaluate” the unhedged foreign-currency
exposures of their clients and charge a premium for such risks
while extending credit to them.  “I advise exporters to buy options to sell their dollars
at a strike price of 50.00. The rupee option market is fairly
liquid up to five years and places no obligation on the exporter
to sell,” Lodha wrote.  “The only risk now is a big event risk triggered by  Europe ,
where all currencies depreciate against the dollar. Fifty is a
psychologically important number and it seems so even for the
RBI. Corporates could also use call spreads with hedging costs
of about 2 percent to 2.5 percent, compared with the 5 percent
cost of a complete hedge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
