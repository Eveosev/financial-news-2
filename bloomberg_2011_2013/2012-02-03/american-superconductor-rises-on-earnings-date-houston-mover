American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , the
wind-turbine part maker suing its former largest customer,
surged the most in two weeks after announcing its quarterly
earnings release date.  The shares rose 12 percent to $5.78 at the close in New
York, the biggest increase since Jan. 18. The Devens,
Massachusetts-based company will report earnings on Feb. 9, it
said in a statement today.  The company last year failed to file its annual report on
time because it was reviewing Chinese revenues. American
Superconductor filed suit in September after an employee was
jailed for stealing intellectual property and selling it to
Beijing-based Sinovel Wind Group Co., a former customer.  “They didn’t report financials on time, they weren’t in
Nasdaq compliance for a long time, and there were a lot of
moving parts that people couldn’t get comfortable with,” said
Carter Driscoll, a Capstone Investments analyst in Miami who
rates the shares a “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
