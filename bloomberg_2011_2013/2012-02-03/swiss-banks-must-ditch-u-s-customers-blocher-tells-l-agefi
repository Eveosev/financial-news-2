Swiss banks should sever ties with
U.S. clients until the legal situation between the two countries
is clarified,  Christoph Blocher , vice president of the  Swiss
People’s Party , said in an interview with l’Agefi.  Wegelin & Co.’s decision to sell its non-American business
to Raiffeisen Schweiz came amid “blackmail” by U.S.
authorities seeking to obtain client data or ruin the firm, the
newspaper cited Blocher as saying. The U.S. is attacking Swiss
banks to gain business for American firms, Blocher told l’Agefi.  Livio Zanolari, a spokesman for Blocher, confirmed in a
telephone interview with Bloomberg News that the comments in
l’Agefi were accurate.  The Swiss People’s Party won the backing of 26.6 percent of
voters in national elections on Oct. 23, the biggest share of
any Swiss party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
