Dallas  Mavericks owner  Mark Cuban  was
fined $75,000 for criticizing the referees in a loss two days
ago to the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Mavericks coach  Rick Carlisle  was given a $35,000 fine for
kicking the ball into the stands early in the fourth quarter of
the same game at American Airlines Center in Dallas, the
 National Basketball Association  said in separate statements.  Cuban, who has been fined more than $1.3 million for past
criticism, told ESPN.com after the loss that “I haven’t said a
whole lot about the officiating in a long, long time, but I
haven’t seen it this bad in a long, long time.”  “Guys miss calls; that’s part of the game,” Cuban said.
“You’re not always going to have a great crew. Officials have
got to learn that’s part of the game. But these were officials
that have been part of the league for years, and it was just
off-the-charts bad. And, if no one ever says anything, nothing
ever happens.”  Carlisle, who received a technical foul early in the fourth
quarter for stepping into the path of an official in protest of
a non-call, was ejected after kicking the ball into the stands
with 9:34 left to play in the 95-86 loss.  He approached the spot under the basket to apologize to the
fans who were hit with the ball, and later apologized at a news
conference, saying that he intended to kick the ball back to the
referee and that “I’m not a very good kick.”  The Mavericks, who won the NBA championship in June, are
14-9, a half-game behind the  San Antonio Spurs  in the Southwest
Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
