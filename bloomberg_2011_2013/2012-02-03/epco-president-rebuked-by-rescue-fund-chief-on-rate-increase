Tokyo Electric Power Co. President
Toshio Nishizawa was rebuked by the head of a government rescue
fund over an increase in electricity rates as he sought approval
for more aid to cover compensation for the Fukushima disaster.  Kazuhiko Shimokobe, the head of the steering committee of
the government-backed Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation
Fund, told Nishizawa it was “regrettable” that the utility
didn’t explain details of its electricity rate increase plan
before it made the announcement on Jan. 17. Nishizawa apologized
and asked the fund’s officials to approve the utility’s request
for further aid.  The utility known as Tepco requested on Dec. 27 689.4
billion yen ($9 billion) in extra aid as it has been relying on
government support to avoid insolvency. Tepco may face 4.5
trillion yen in compensation payments by 2013 after the March 11
quake and tsunami caused meltdowns and radiation release at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station.  Officials of the fund approved the utility’s request for
further aid at the end of today’s closed meeting, Tepco said in
a statement. The request was then submitted to Trade and
Industry Minister  Yukio Edano , it said.  Tepco plans to raise electricity rates for corporate
customers by an average of 17 percent from April to cover rising
fuel costs to run thermal plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
