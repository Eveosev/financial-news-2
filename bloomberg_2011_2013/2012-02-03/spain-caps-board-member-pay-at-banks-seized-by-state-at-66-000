Spain ’s government passed a decree to
cap board members’ pay at banks seized by the state at 50,000
euros ($66,000) and said chief executives of lenders receiving
any state aid can’t earn more than 600,000 euros.  Board members at seized banks will also be barred from
bonuses, and the chief executives of those lenders will have
their pay capped at 300,000 euros, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said today after the Cabinet meeting in Madrid.  Annual pay for chief executives and chairmen of lenders in
which the state owns preference shares will be capped at 600,000
euros, with bonuses suspended. Board members’ pay at those
lenders will be limited to 100,000 euros.  The  rules , passed by the six week-old People’s Party
government, are part of a decree that forces banks to recognize
losses on real-estate assets while offering public support for
lenders that merge. The government is trying to bolster banks
and restore the flow of credit to the shrinking economy without
alienating voters suffering from a 23 percent unemployment rate
and the deepest austerity measures in at least three decades.  The pay limits in Spain, which has spent about 15 billion
euros bailing out lenders, contrast with remuneration in the
U.K., where the government injected 45.5 billion euros into
 Royal Bank of Scotland Plc.  Chief Executive Officer  Stephen Hester  waived his 963,000-pound ($1.26 million) bonus after the
opposition  Labour Party  said it would ask Parliament to vote on
the award.  Spanish banks that have received support from the
government in the form of preference shares include BFA, the
parent company of Madrid-listed Bankia SA.  Rodrigo Rato , the
former head of the  International Monetary Fund , heads the BFA
group and the listed lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
