Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  Philippine (PASHR)  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Manila.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (PCOMP)  fell 1.3 percent to
4,758.57, snapping a three-day rally that drove the gauge
yesterday to a record close. The measure posted its sharpest
loss since Nov. 10 today, trimming this week’s gain to 1.7
percent.  Cebu Air Inc. (CEB)  , the nation’s largest budget
carrier, climbed 4.8 percent to 71.25 pesos, the highest close
since Nov. 22, after CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets analyst Leo Venezuela reiterated his “conviction buy” rating on the stock.  Cebu Air shares may extend gains this year, driven by
“several catalysts,” including faster passenger growth, a plan
to begin long-haul flights and the nation’s improving tourism
industry,  Venezuela  wrote in a report dated Feb. 2. The stock
will reach 91 pesos in 12 months, he wrote.  IP E-Game Ventures Inc. (EG)  , a Manila-based online
games publisher, advanced 1.5 percent to 20 centavos, the
sharpest gain since Jan. 24. The company will expand into
entertainment, hotel and leisure-related ventures, Philippine
Star reported, citing President Enrique Gonzales. Gonzales
couldn’t be reached for comment in his office.  JG Summit Holdings Inc. (JGS PM), owner of Cebu Air, sank
11 percent to 25.25 pesos, the sharpest loss since November
2008. The company said its affiliates sold 215 million shares in
a private placement at 25 pesos each, a 12 percent discount to
yesterday’s 28.50-peso closing price.  SM Investments Corp. (SM)  , holding company of Philippine
billionaire Henry Sy, slid from a record, falling 3.8 percent to
651 pesos. The stock posted its sharpest loss since Oct. 3 after
the company sold $250 million of convertible bonds and a
technical indicator reached a level that some traders use as a
signal to sell.  A three-day, 11 percent advance drove the shares to the
highest close yesterday since the stock began trading in March
2005. The rally pushed the 14-day relative strength index to 77
yesterday, the highest since September 2010, above the level of
70 that some investors view as a sign that a security is poised
to decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
