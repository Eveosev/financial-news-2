U.S. stocks advanced, extending the
best start to a year for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since
1987, after a report showed that employment growth topped
estimates and the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 8.3 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Alcoa (AA)  Inc.
rallied at least 3.2 percent to pace gains among companies most-
tied to economic growth. The Dow Jones Transportation Average
gained 1.2 percent as  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  climbed 1.9 percent.  Genworth
Financial Inc. (GNW) , a mortgage guarantor and life insurer, surged 14
percent after swinging to a profit.  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  rose 4.1
percent as earnings at the meat processor beat estimates.  The S&P 500 added 1.5 percent to 1,344.90 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The benchmark gauge has rallied for five straight
weeks, the  longest streak  in a year. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 156.82 points, or 1.2 percent, to 12,862.23, the
highest level since 2008. The Russell 2000 Index of small
companies jumped 2.2 percent to 831.11. The Nasdaq Composite
Index rose 1.6 percent to 2,905.66, the highest since 2000.  “Spectacular,” Ron Florance, managing director of
investment strategy for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said in a
telephone interview from Phoenix. His firm manages $169 billion.
“It’s a very, very strong jobs number. It shows that companies
have confidence that they see global demand growth through their
products and services. That will support risk assets.”  Stocks and bond yields jumped as the report fueled optimism
the economy is weathering  Europe ’s debt crisis. The 243,000
increase in payrolls was the most since April and beat all
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The  unemployment rate  fell
to the lowest since February 2009. Service industries in the
U.S. expanded in January at the fastest pace in almost a year.  Corporate Profits  The  S&P 500  has gained 6.9 percent so far this year, the
most since it surged 14 percent over the same period in 1987.
The index has recovered after plunging 19 percent between April
29 and Oct. 3 amid better-than estimated economic data and
corporate profits. It’s 1.4 percent away from surpassing its
peak nine months ago, which would send it to the highest level
since June 2008. It has rallied 2.2 percent this  week .  Better economic data should help drive solid corporate
earnings, said Brad Sorensen at  Charles Schwab  Corp. Earnings in
the  S&P 500  are forecast to rise 9 percent this year to $104.68,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. At
yesterday’s close of $104.68, the index was trading at 12.7
times projected earnings in 2012 and 11.2 times predictions for
2013. It has traded at an average price-earnings ratio of  16.4 
since 1954, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Decent Year’  “It will be a decent year for the stock market,”
Sorensen, director of market and sector analysis at San
Francisco-based Charles Schwab, said in a telephone interview.
His firm has $1.68 trillion in client assets. “Investors are
starting to rotate some money into stocks as they become more
confident in the economic outlook.”  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  climbed 2.8 percent amid
economic optimism. The KBW Bank Index rallied 3.3 percent. A
gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes gained 5.8 percent.  Bank of America added 5.2 percent to $7.84. Caterpillar,
the largest construction and mining-equipment maker, increased
3.3 percent to $113.94. Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum
producer, climbed 3.3 percent to $10.76. FedEx, an economic
bellwether as it moves goods from pharmaceuticals to financial
documents, jumped 1.9 percent to $94.54.  Genworth Financial soared 14 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $9.17. Chief Executive Officer Michael Fraizer has
scaled back the retirement-products business to conserve capital
as Genworth seeks to maintain sales of U.S. mortgage coverage.  Tyson, Gilead  Tyson Foods rose 4.1 percent to $19.38. The meat processor
reported first-quarter  earnings  of 42 cents a share. On average,
the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated profit of 34 cents.  Gilead Sciences (GILD)  Inc. jumped 11 percent to $54.70. The
drugmaker that acquired Pharmasset Inc. last month for its
experimental hepatitis C treatments gained after one of the
medicines produced positive clinical trial results.  Brocade Communications Systems Inc. (BRCD)  rose 1.4 percent to
$5.91.  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  is studying a leveraged buyout of the
company, said a person with knowledge of the situation. While
Blackstone is in talks with Brocade, which has been seeking a
buyer since 2009, reaching a deal may be difficult, said the
person.  Estee Lauder Cos. (EL)  lost 2.3 percent to $57.48. The maker of
Mac cosmetics and Clinique skin care forecast third-quarter
earnings of no more than 32 cents a share, before restructuring
charges, missing the average analyst estimate of 41 cents.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  slipped 4.8 percent to $114.98. Wynn
Macau Ltd.’s full-year profit missed analysts’ estimates as the
Hong Kong-listed unit benefited less than its competitor, Sands
China Ltd., from surging gambling revenue in the former
Portuguese colony.  To contact the reporter on this story:
