China Petroleum & Petrochemical Corp. 
and  China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOZ)  each advanced four places
in the 2012  Energy Intelligence Group (OPCBRTOT)  ranking of the top 100  oil
companies  as acquisitions added to production and reserves.  China  Petroleum, or Sinopec, the publicly traded arm of
state-owned  China Petrochemical Corp (SINZ) ., rose to 22nd in the
ranking and China National Offshore, parent of  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , rose
to 34th, Ian Nathan, who has compiled the report for the past
four years, said today in an interview.  Rising production of oil and gas helped both companies
advance, Nathan said. The pair also benefited from increasing
oil and gas reserves boosted by acquisitions, he said. Energy
Intelligence, a global energy industry consultant, compiled
company-reported 2010 reserves, production, product sales and
refinery capacity for its rankings.  “Growth of these companies is due in large part to
acquisitions,” Nathan said. “They’ve done pretty well at home
as well.”  China’s other major state-owned oil company,  China National
Petroleum Corp. (CNPZ) , remains wedged in fifth place between  Petroleos
de Venezuela SA (PDVSA)  and  BP Plc (BP/)  of the U.K., Nathan said.  The top five companies, led by Saudi Arabian Oil Co., are
so large that only a significant acquisition could budge CNPC
past PDVSA, he said. National Iranian Oil Co. is second on the
list, followed by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)   ConocoPhillips (COP) , the third-largest U.S. oil company, dropped
to 12th place from 8th as it sold assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
