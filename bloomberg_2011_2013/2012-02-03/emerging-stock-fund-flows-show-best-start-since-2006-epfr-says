Emerging-market stock funds had their
best start to a year since 2006 in terms of inflows as investors
started to discount a Chinese slowdown and the U.S. recovery
gained traction, according to EPFR Global.  Flows into developing-nation  equity  funds totaled $3.5
billion in the week ended Feb. 1, a 43-week high, bringing the
total for 2012 to $11.3 billion, according to a report e-mailed
today by the Boston-based research company.  Global emerging-market equity funds provided $2.6 billion
of the new commitments. The average emerging market portfolio
recorded an 11 percent gain, EPFR Global said.  Inflows into emerging-market bond funds reached a 26-week
high of $1.55 billion, EPFR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
