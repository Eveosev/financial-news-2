Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , a
Japanese carmaker seeking an alliance with Chery Automobile Co.
in  China , will pursue a deal until the end of this fiscal year
to expand in the world’s largest car market.  “We’ll pursue the possibility of beginning production in
China until the end of this fiscal year,” President Yasuyuki Yoshinaga told reporters today in Tokyo.  Fuji Heavy, 16 percent owned by Toyota Motor Corp., has
said its plan to tie up with Chery must win regulatory approval
in China. Toyota already has two partnerships in the country,
the maximum under foreign investment rules.  The maker of Subaru cars and sport-utility vehicles  expects
2012 global sales  to grow 13 percent to a record 700,000 units,
including 320,000 in the  United States , according to a statement
the company released today. Global vehicle production may rise
20 percent to a record 698,000 units in the year, the company
said.  The automaker also  raised its forecast  for annual profit
because of better-than-expected sales of its Impreza model in
the U.S. and the XV in China, it said in the statement.  Net income will probably be 41 billion yen in the year
ending March 31, 14 percent higher than the company’s previous
forecast. Profit was 50.3 billion yen in the previous year.  Fuji Heavy fell 1.7 percent to 528 yen at the close of
trading in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
