 Samruk-Kazyna (SKKZ)  increased profit 13 percent last year, not
including the banks in which it holds stakes.  Net income rose to 594 billion tenge ($4 billion) from 526
billion tenge in 2010, the fund said in a statement distributed

companies such as oil and gas producer KazMunaiGaz National
Corp., railway monopoly Kazakhstan Temir Zholy and nuclear
company Kazatomprom. The fund also controls stakes in failed
lenders including BTA Bank, which is now seeking its second
restructuring in as many years.  Consolidated profit will probably reach 736.3 billion tenge

in its Twitter Inc. account, citing Nurlan Rakhmetov, a board
member. Samruk-Kazyna’ now holds 13 trillion tenge of assets,
according to Rakhmetov.  The combined revenue of the group of companies controlled
by the fund accounted for 23 percent of Kazakh gross domestic
product from 2008 to 2010, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
