Oil rose from near a six-week low,
narrowing its weekly loss in  New York  after the U.S. jobless
rate unexpectedly fell to the lowest in three years.  Payrolls rose by 243,000 last month, the most since April
and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey, Labor
Department figures showed in Washington. The  unemployment rate 
dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest since February 2009.  “The jobs data shows the economy is gaining momentum,”
 Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.
“This is bullish for risk appetite and therefore for commodity
prices. However, it may limit the scope for a third round of
quantitative easing, and this may limit gains.”  Crude for March delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange rose as much as $1.11 to $97.47 a barrel and was at
$96.89 at 1:42 p.m. London time, trimming the contract’s decline
this week to 2.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
