The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell after a report showed the U.S.
jobless rate unexpectedly dropped to the lowest in three years.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit
ratings decreased 18 basis points to 562, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 2 p.m. in London. The measure is headed for a
seventh straight weekly decline, the longest run in five years.  Sentiment was boosted by speculation the worldâ€™s largest
economy is improving and a Greek debt deal is imminent. The
243,000 increase in U.S. payrolls was the biggest jump since
April and exceeded all forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey,
Labor Department data showed. The  unemployment rate  fell to 8.3
percent, the lowest since 2009.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 3.75 basis points to 131 basis
points and is headed for a fourth weekly decrease. A decline
signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers dropped five basis points to 198 and
the subordinated index declined seven basis points to 343.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell three basis points to 320, the lowest since
Dec. 5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
