Indonesia ’s bonds had a fourth weekly
gain as data showed inflation in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest
economy eased for a fifth month in January.  Foreign ownership  of government debt increased 5.8 percent
to 235.85 trillion rupiah ($26.3 billion) this year through Jan.
31, finance ministry data show. Consumer prices in Indonesia
rose 3.65 percent last month from a year earlier after climbing
3.79 percent in December, the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said
Feb. 1. The rupiah dropped today as regional stocks snapped a
three-day advance as Greece and its creditors struggled to reach
an agreement on a debt swap.  “Inflation has been coming off in the past few months and
that has pushed yields down,” said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a senior
economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “The
risk appetite for  emerging markets  has strengthened.”  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell 30 basis points, or 0.30 percentage point, this week to
5.24 percent, according to midday prices by the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. That’s the lowest level since the security
was sold in September. The rate fell eight basis points today.  Moody’s Investors Service restored Indonesia to investment-
grade credit status on Jan. 18, following  Fitch Ratings  the
month before.  Gross domestic product  in Indonesia increased 6.45
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, compared with
a 6.5 percent pace in the previous three months, according to
the median of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of a
government report due Feb. 6.  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 8,979 per dollar today as
of 3:30 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It was little changed for the week. The
currency reached 8,878 yesterday, just shy of the 12-week high
of 8,875 it touched on Jan. 25.  Greece  and its creditors are locked in talks over a debt-
swap deal for the nation. Finance ministers from Germany,
Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands will meet in Berlin
today to discuss Europe’s debt crisis, a German Finance Ministry
spokesman said yesterday  To contact the reporter on this story:
