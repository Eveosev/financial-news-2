Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  and other
Japanese utilities will have to limit increases in their tariffs
by revising their method for calculating costs, the Yomiuri
newspaper reported, citing unidentified officials.  The Japanese government is planning to make power companies
reduce the labor cost reference they use to calculate charges by
20 percent, the Yomiuri said. Companies will be asked to cut
costs by buying fuel supplies together, according to the report.  The changes will affect Tokyo Electric, which is planning
to ask for government permission to raise household rates to
help it pay for higher fuel costs after the disaster at its
Fukushima nuclear station, the paper said.  Tokyo Electric overestimated costs used to calculate prices
for its customers for as many as 10 years, a government
committee investigating the utilityâ€™s finances said in September
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
