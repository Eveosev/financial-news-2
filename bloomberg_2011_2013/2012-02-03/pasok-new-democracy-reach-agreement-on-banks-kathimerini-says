Greece ’s two biggest parties, Pasok
and New Democracy, reached a common position on how the state
should recapitalize the country’s banks,  Kathimerini  reported,
without saying how it got the information.  The parties, which both support Prime Minister Lucas Papademos’s interim government, favor recapitalizing banks for
losses arising from a sovereign debt swap by issuing them with
convertible bonds of three- to five-year duration, the Athens-
based newspaper said. If the banks didn’t call the bonds at the
end of that period, the debt would be converted to common shares
with full  voting rights , Kathimerini said.  The manner of the recapitalization is still being
negotiated with officials from the European Commission, the
 European Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund , the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
