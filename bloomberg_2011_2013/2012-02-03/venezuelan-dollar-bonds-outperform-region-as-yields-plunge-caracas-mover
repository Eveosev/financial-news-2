Venezuela ’s bonds gained, pushing
yields relative to Treasuries to the lowest level in a year, as
signs U.S. economic growth is accelerating fueled demand for
higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold Venezuelan
dollar debt instead of Treasuries shrank 56 basis points, or
0.56 percentage point, at 4:58 p.m. in  New York  to 1,073 basis
points, the lowest since Feb. 8, 2011, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index. The yield differential has
narrowed 80 basis points in the past week, compared with 33 for
 Latin American government debt , the index showed.  Venezuelan bonds, the highest-yielding emerging-market
securities after Belize and Pakistan, rallied after a report
today showed the U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly fell to the
lowest level in three years. Oil, Venezuela’s top export, rose
1.5 percent to $97.80 a barrel. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
increased 1.5 percent.  “There’s a huge rally today and my sense is that everyone
is very bullish because of the U.S. data and that’s been a big
positive for risk assets,”  Jeff Williams , an emerging-market
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York, said in a phone
interview. With positive data in the  U.S. economy  pushing the
S&P 500 higher, “people want to go long risk, and Venezuela is
the cheapest place to do it in  Latin America ,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
