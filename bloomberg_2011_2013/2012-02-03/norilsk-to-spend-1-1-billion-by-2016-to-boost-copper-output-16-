OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (GMKN) ,  Russia ’s
largest mining company, plans to spend $1.1 billion by 2016 to
develop an eastern Siberian copper field and boost output of the
highly conductive metal by 16 percent.  The Bystrinsky deposit is expected to yield 62,000 metric
tons of copper and 6.3 tons of gold in concentrate a year, First
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Yury Filippov said in an e-mailed
response to questions. Norilsk plans to complete a feasibility
study this quarter and build a processing plant at the site by
the end of 2016, he said.  Norilsk, whose copper output above the Arctic Circle in
Russia has been declining for the past six years, seeks to
expand production of the metal to diversify away from nickel,
where it controls about a quarter of global output. Bystrinsky
lies near Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, about 2,300 kilometers
(1,450 miles) southeast of the city of Norilsk.  Norilsk will mine as much 2.16 million tons of  iron ore 
concentrate a year as a by-product at Bystrinsky.  “These volumes are insignificant for steel-related mining;
still they will allow us to taste this business and be able to
consider further expansion,” Filippov said.  The second stage of the eastern Siberian project is the
development of the neighboring Bugdainsky deposit. The ore
contains molybdenum, which like nickel is used to make steel
alloys. “We can sell it to our existing clients,” Filippov
said. Molybdenum began trading on the London Metals Exchange in
2010.  Norilsk also plans to build a processing plant at
Bugdainsky by the end of 2016 and produce 9,000 tons of
molybdenum a year there starting from 2017, Filippov said. He
declined to provide capital spending estimates for the project.
Molybdenum trades at $31,000 per ton in  London , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
