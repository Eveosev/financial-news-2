The Russian Ambassador to  North Korea 
urged the U.S. and  South Korea  to exercise restraint in
conducting joint military drills, the North’s state-run Korean
Central News Agency said.  North Korea is concerned about its people’s grief over the
death of Kim Jong Il, and the U.S. and South Korea should take
that into consideration to ensure stability on the Korean
peninsula, Ambassador Valery Sukhinin told reporters today in
Pyongyang, according to KCNA.  The report didn’t say which military drills Sukhinin was
referring to. The U.S. and South Korea are set to hold joint
drills from Feb. 27 to March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
