The strategy of containment that was
used during the  Cold War  to defend against a military threat
from the  Soviet Union  can be applied to contend with a threat
from Iran, said Wolfgang Ischinger, organizer of the  Munich
Security Conference .  “I hope we’re not going to get into a situation where the
only alternative to the current policy of sanctions is a policy
of war,” Ischinger  said  on ZDF public television today. “We
have to talk about which conceivable options there are to either
continue sanctions or complement them by a containment policy.”  Israel says it is willing to destroy Iran’s atomic
infrastructure to prevent Tehran from building a bomb. Military
threats against Iran have become part of the West’s strategy to
convince  Iran  to abandon its nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
