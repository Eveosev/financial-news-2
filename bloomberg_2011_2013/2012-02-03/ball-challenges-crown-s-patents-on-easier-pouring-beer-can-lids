Ball Corp. (BLL) , a maker of containers for
Miller beer and Pepsi-Cola, sued  Crown Holdings Inc. (CCK)  to
challenge its competitor’s patents for easier-pouring  aluminum-
can tops .  Ball won a court ruling Jan. 31 that an earlier version of
its so-called can ends, the side from which people drink, don’t
infringe Crown patents. Based on a Feb. 1 filing, Ball is now
asking a federal court in Dayton,  Ohio , for clearance of its
newest cans, especially those designs for  beer containers .  The dispute centers around can tops that use less metal and
are marketed as being easier for beverage makers to fill and for
consumers to pour. Crown, best known for inventing the bottle
cap, has said the SuperEnd cans that it began selling in 2000
reduce metal use by 10 percent. More than 300 billion SuperEnd
beverage ends have been produced, Michael Dunleavy, a spokesman
for Philadelphia-based Crown, said today.  Dunleavy said the company won’t comment on the litigation.  Ball claims Crown has embarked on an almost decade-long
legal effort against packaging competitors, including claims
against  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (BUD)  and London-based  Rexam Plc. (REX)   The patents “have been the subject of extensive and
generally unsuccessful litigation by Crown,” Broomfield,
Colorado-based Ball said in the complaint.  The case is Ball Metal Beverage Container Corp. v. Crown
Packaging Technology Inc., 12cv33, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of Ohio (Dayton).  To contact the reporters on this story:
