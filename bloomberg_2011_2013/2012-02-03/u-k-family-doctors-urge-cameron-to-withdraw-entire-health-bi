The U.K.’s Royal College of General
Practitioners has written to Prime Minister  David Cameron  urging
the “complete withdrawal” of the Health and Social Care Bill,
and has called for an “urgent” debate on the scope and
capabilities of the  National Health Service , the RCGP said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The RCGP is seeking the withdrawal of the bill because it
proposes a “damaging, unnecessary and expensive
reorganisation,” which would damage patient care, could
“jeopardise” the NHS and potentially lead to a “two tier
system with access to care defined by a patient’s ability to
pay,” it said in the statement.  The plea to Cameron follows correspondence about possible
changes to the bill with Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, and
after the amendments presented to the House of Lords on Feb. 1,
the RCGP says. The college represents more than 44,000 family
doctors.  “Despite the number and extent of the amendments” to the
bill that were established in the House of Lords, the
organization remains worried about the “irreparable”
consequences for the health service and patients, the RCGP says.  While the government “has claimed that it has made
widespread concessions, our view is that the amendments have
created greater confusion,” RCGP Chairman Clare Gerada said in
the statement.  A survey carried out by the RCGP, the third in a series
commissioned by Gerada, showed that three quarters of family
doctors think it “appropriate” to call for the withdrawal of
the bill, the statement also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
