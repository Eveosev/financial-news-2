Greek Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos 
may resign if the leaders of the parties backing his interim
government don’t agree to the conditions of a new financing
plan, Skai TV  reported  on its website, without saying how it got
the information.  If no agreement is reached at a meeting between Papademos
and the three political party leaders that will probably take
place tomorrow, the prime minister will call an election, the
Athens-based broadcaster said.  Pantelis Kapsis, a Greek government spokesman, didn’t
answer a call to his cell phone seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
