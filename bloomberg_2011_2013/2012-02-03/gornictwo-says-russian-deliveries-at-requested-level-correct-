Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , Poland’s dominant gas company, said deliveries
from  Russia  returned to the requested level today after they
were reduced yesterday.  “We’re getting as much gas as we’ve asked for,”
spokeswoman Joanna Zakrzewska told Bloomberg News by phone.
Deliveries from  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ’s unit were cut by about 7 percent
yesterday, the company said in a statement.  Poland imported 76 percent of the 14.4 billion cubic meters
it consumed last year, most of it from Russia. The country’s
daily gas consumption reached a record high of 70.3 million
cubic meters yesterday as temperatures in Warsaw dropped to
minus 23 degrees Celsius (minus 9.4 Fahrenheit), reaching the
lowest level in two years.  The usage was 37 percent above the average consumption in
January, the  Economy Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday, adding that the figure could exceed 72 million cubic
meters by Feb. 6.  The ministry yesterday allowed the use of mandatory gas
reserves after PGNiG said on Feb. 1 it reduced supplies to three
industrial customers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
