Ukraine’s grain harvest will probably
fall 25 percent to 42.6 million metric tons this year as yields
of corn, wheat and barley decline after an autumn drought and a
cold winter, agriculture researcher ProAgro said.  This compares with a record 56.8 million ton harvest in
2011, the Kiev-based researcher said in an e-mailed statement
today. Average grain yields will decline by 0.67 tons per
hectare (2.47 acre) to 3 tons per hectare, ProAgro said.  Wheat, which is planted almost entirely in the autumn, will
decline the most of all grains, by 35 percent to 14.6 million
tons from 22.3 million tons. The corn harvest will fall by 22
percent to 17.7 million tons from record 22.8 million ton crop
last year.  The country’s winter grains, mostly wheat and also barley
and rapeseed, were planted in the autumn during the worst
drought in at least 50 years. Weakened plants are lacking snow
cover protection in seven of Ukraine’s 25 regions after
temperatures dropped to as low as minus 32.2 degrees Celsius
(minus 26 Fahrenheit) today.  The barley harvest is seen falling 11 percent to 8.1
million tons from 9.1 million tons in 2011, ProAgro said.  Winter Grain  The Ukrainian Agriculture Ministry increased its estimation
of winter grain areas to be replanted in the spring to between
2.5 million and 3 million hectares, according to the Ukrainian
Agrarian Confederation, which cited Oleksandr Sen, deputy
agriculture minister.  The nation’s grain exports in the marketing year ending
June 30 will be 24.47 million tons, almost double the amount the
previous marketing year when the country exported 12.29 million
tons, the researcher said.  Exports may not exceed 8 million tons of wheat, 3 million
tons of barley and 13 million tons of corn, according to
ProAgro. The country’s grain carryover stock will almost double
last year’s level and reach 11 million tons. Inventories will
include 5.4 million tons of wheat, 2 million tons of barley and
3.4 million tons of corn, according to ProAgro estimates.  Sunflower seed production will gain 17.6 percent to 9.5
million tons in 2011, the researcher said. This will help
increase sunflower oil production by 13.5 percent to 3.6 million
tons and sunflower oil exports by 16.8 percent to 3.1 million
tons in the marketing year ending Aug. 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
