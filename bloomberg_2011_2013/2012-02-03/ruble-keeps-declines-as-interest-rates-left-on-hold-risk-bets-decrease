The ruble climbed against the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket, extending its fifth
consecutive weekly gain after better-than-expected jobs data
spurred prices for oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner.  The ruble gained 0.2 percent to 34.3975 against the basket
at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, extending its weekly rise to 0.5
percent. The Russian currency was little changed at 30.19 per
dollar and rose 0.4 percent to 39.54 per euro.  Crude futures jumped 0.8 percent to $97.14 per barrel in
 New York  after the U.S. Labor Department said the  unemployment
rate  dropped to the lowest level since February 2009 last month,
a sign commodity demand may rise. Russia is the world’s largest
energy exporter.  Bank Rossii left its main rates unchanged today even as
inflation plunged to the lowest level in two decades. Consumer
price inflation fell to 4.1 percent in Russia in January, the
regulator said in a statement.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 were little changed, leaving
the yield steady at 4.307 percent. Ruble bonds due 2021 yielded
12 basis points less than yesterday, at 7.87 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
