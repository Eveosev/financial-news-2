Ethanol fell for a second day as
inventories climbed for the seventh week in a row.  Ethanol  stockpiles  rose 5.8 percent to 20.9 million barrels
last week, the Energy Department said Feb. 1, the highest level
since the department began keeping weekly records in June 2010.
Production rose to 939,000 barrels a day, the first advance this
year.  “They are simply running out of room and storage and
because of that the biofuels have slowed down,” Jim Damask, a
manager at Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative
energy broker, said by phone. “The need for ethanol is just
less than what we’ve seen.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery retreated 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.131 a gallon on the Chicago Board

contract was unchanged at $2.173.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  Chicago  declined 1.25
