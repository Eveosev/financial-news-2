Three former Credit Bancorp Ltd.
officials convicted of operating an international  Ponzi scheme 
must pay almost $329 million in a lawsuit brought by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, a U.S. judge said.  U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in New York yesterday
ordered the final judgment against Thomas Rittweger, manager of
North American operations for the firm, Douglas Brandon, a
Kentucky lawyer who represented the firm, and Richard Blech, who
was Credit Bancorpâ€™s chairman and chief executive officer.  Rittweger and Brandon were convicted at trial in 2003 of
defrauding clients, including the chairman of  Vintage Petroleum
Inc. (VPI) , of $210 million, prosecutors said. Blech pleaded guilty
before trial.  Unbeknownst to its clients, the firm operated as a Ponzi
scheme, taking cash and other assets from new investors to make
payments to earlier ones, creating the impression of sizable
returns, prosecutors said.  In his order, Sweet, who was presiding over the SEC suit,
directed that the three were liable for $218 million,
representing profits from the scheme, with additional interest
of $110.5 million.  According to court and U.S. Bureau of Prison records,
Brandon was sentenced to 97 months in prison, Blech was
sentenced to 72 months in prison and was released in 2007 and
Rittweger was sentenced to serve 135 months in prison and
ordered to pay more than $18 million in restitution. He is
scheduled to be released from prison in 2015.  The cases are U.S. v. Blech, 02-CR-122, and SEC v. Credit
Bancorp, 99-cv-11395, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
