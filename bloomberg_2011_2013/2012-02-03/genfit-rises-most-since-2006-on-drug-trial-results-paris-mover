Genfit (ALGFT) , a French drug developer, rose
the most since 2006 in Paris trading after saying an
experimental drug met all the goals of a mid-stage clinical
trial in treating risk factors associated with diabetes.  Genfit rose 84 percent to 3.45 euros, giving the company a
market value of 47 million euros ($62 million). It was the
biggest advance ever for the company, which first sold shares to
the public in December 2006.  The drug, GFT505, improved the liverâ€™s sensitivity to
insulin, and helps with a condition called dyslipidemia, which
includes low levels of so-called good cholesterol and elevated
readings of triglycerides, or fats in the bloodstream, the Loos,
France-based company said in a statement. There were no adverse
side effects, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
