China’s stocks  rose, driving the
benchmark index to its longest stretch of weekly gains in seven
months, on speculation the central bank may take more measures
to boost economic growth and signs that a cash crunch is easing.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  and China Merchants Bank Co.
led an advance for lenders on prospects the central bank may
lower reserve-ratio requirements. Xinjiang Dushanzi Tianli High
& New Tech Co. jumped 10 percent, pacing gains for a gauge of
small companies, after the government said it will promote the
role of technology in agriculture.  “Though China’s growth is slowing, it won’t be a hard
landing,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at Shanghai River
Fund Management Co. “ Monetary policy  is starting to ease and
the market’s expectations of a reserve-requirement cut are
rising. Stocks are also really cheap now.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 17.85 points, or 0.8
percent, to 2,330.41, the highest level since Dec. 7. It climbed
0.5 percent for a third weekly gain, the longest since the
period ended July 15. The  CSI 300 Index  advanced 0.8 percent to
2,506.09. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 0.6 percent
yesterday in  New York .  The Shanghai Composite has climbed 6 percent this year,
after plunging 33 percent in the previous two years, on
speculation slowing economic growth will push the central bank
to relax monetary policies and the government will take measures
to support stocks. The measure trades at 9.6 times estimated
earnings, near the record low of 8.9 times reached on Jan. 6,
according to weekly  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash Crunch Eases  Stocks advanced this week after a report on manufacturing
expanded more than economists’ forecasts and Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said the government will support small companies with a 15
billion-yuan ($2.4 billion) fund amid a cash crunch.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 98.1 basis points, or 0.981
percentage point, to 3.35 percent as of 3:35 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It’s the biggest drop since Jan. 19.  Construction Bank, the nation’s second-biggest lender,
added 0.8 percent to 4.89 yuan. China Merchants rose 0.9 percent
to 12.98 yuan.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016) , the nation’s first
privately owned bank, advanced 0.9 percent to 6.55 yuan.  “I still expect China to do something and cut reserve
ratios this month,”  Frances Cheung , a Hong Kong-based
strategist at Credit Agricole CIB, said yesterday. “I think
liquidity is still going to be tight, if there is no liquidity
injection.”  Smallcaps Rise  Xinjiang Dushanzi Tianli jumped 10 percent to 6.90 yuan,
leading gains in the CSI Smallcap 500 Index, which rose 1.7
percent. The ChiNext index of start-ups advanced 2.2 percent.  China will promote the role of innovation and technology in
agriculture for better harvests and to guarantee the supply of
agricultural products, Vice Premier Hui Liangyu said in a
statement posted on the central government’s website.  Equities fell earlier today after industrial companies’
profits and a gauge of  service industries  expanded at a slower
pace.  The non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to
52.9 from 56 in December, the National Bureau of Statistics and
 China  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in a statement
today in Beijing. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  The January non-PMI reading was “not that bad” given the
timing of the Chinese holiday this year, Bank of America Corp.
China economist Ting Lu said in a report. The Lunar New Year
holiday ran from Jan. 22 through Jan. 28.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits climbed 25.4 percent
from 2010 to 5.45 trillion yuan last year, the National Bureau
of Statistics said. That compared with a 49.4 percent gain in
the first 11 months of 2010.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
