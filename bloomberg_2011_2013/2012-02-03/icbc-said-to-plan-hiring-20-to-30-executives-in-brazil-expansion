Industrial & Commercial Bank of China
Ltd. , the world’s biggest lender by market value, may hire 20 to
30 executives in  Brazil  as it expands in South America’s biggest
economy, said a person familiar with the plans.  ICBC is seeking to offer banking services to Chinese
companies that trade with or have offices in Brazil, said the
person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plan
isn’t public. The bank will fill about 30 percent of the
positions with senior managers, the person said. The Beijing-
based lender, which said in April that it wants to set up a bank
in Brazil, needs a license from the central bank.  Wang Zhenning, a spokesman for ICBC in Beijing, declined to
comment. Brazil’s central bank declined to comment, according to
an e-mailed statement.  Brazil traded $77.1 billion in goods with  China  last year,
or 16 percent of South America’s total trade volume of $482.3
billion, according to figures from Trade Ministry in Brasilia.
China overtook the U.S. as Brazil’s biggest trading partner in
2009, buying commodities such as  iron ore  and selling toys, auto
parts and vehicles.  ICBC agreed in August to buy assets of Standard Bank Group
Ltd. in  Argentina  for $600 million. ICBC owns 20 percent of
Johannesburg-based Standard Bank, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. Banco Standard de Investimentos SA is Standard Bank’s
Brazil unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
