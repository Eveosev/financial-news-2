France ’s main pilots’ union, SNPL,
said it has called for a strike between Feb. 6 and Feb. 9 to
protest government plans to require minimum service during labor
action.  The union said the government is seeking to limit their
right to oppose management decisions that go against their
interests. Air France said that on Feb. 6, it plans to operate
more than 85 percent of its long-haul flights, and more than 80
percent of medium-haul flights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
