Schaeffler AG, the roller-bearing
maker that controls tire company  Continental AG (CON) , has set pricing
on 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) of loans used to refinance
debt, according to three people with direct knowledge of the
deal.  A 1 billion-euro revolving credit facility and a 3 billion-
euro term loan B that mature in 2015 will pay initial interest
of 425 basis points more than the euro interbank offered rate,
said the people, who declined to be identified as the
transaction is private.  Two 1 billion-euro term loans denoted C1 and C2 and
maturing in 2017 will pay interest of 550 basis points more than
benchmark rates, said the people. The C1 tranche is currently
being held by banks and the C2 tranche is being offered to
investors at a price of 97 percent of face value and with a 1.5
percent floor on the benchmark lending rate, two of the people
said.  BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., Commerzbank AG, Landesbank Baden-
Wuerttemberg, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UniCredit SpA
arranged the financing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Schaeffler sold 2 billion euros of bonds this week, double
the amount planned, the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company
said today in a statement.  Proceeds from the bond sale will be used to refinance a 2
billion-euro bridge loan taken as part of an 8 billion-euro debt
facility in January, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
