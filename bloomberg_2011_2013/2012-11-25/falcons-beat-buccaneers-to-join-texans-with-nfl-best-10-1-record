Eli Manning and the  New York Giants 
broke out of their slump with a 38-10 win over the  Green Bay
Packers , with Manning throwing three touchdown passes to eclipse
Phil Simms for the most in franchise history.  Manning, who hadn’t thrown a touchdown pass in the Giants’
previous three games, tossed a 16-yard scoring pass to Rueben
Randle in the first quarter to give New York the lead for good
last night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  Manning also threw scoring passes to Victor Cruz and Hakeem
Nicks as the Giants improved to 7-4 and halted the Packers’
five-game winning streak, which had been tied for the longest in
the National Football League entering Week 12. Manning said the
Giants benefitted from having off last week.  “We played as a full team, that’s something we’ve been
missing for a while,” Manning, who has 200 career touchdown
passes, said in a televised interview. “Our bodies, our minds
needed a little rest and obviously it helped out a little.”  The Atlanta Falcons held off the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24-23
to tie Houston for the NFL’s best record at 10-1, while the San
Francisco 49ers halted the New Orleans Saints’ three-game
winning streak with a 31-21 victory in quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s second career start.  With the Packers’ loss last night, the  Denver Broncos  now
have the NFL’s longest winning streak, extending their run to
six with yesterday’s 17-9 road win over the Kansas City Chiefs.  Peyton Manning  threw two touchdown passes for Denver (8-3)
in recording his 149th career NFL win as a starting quarterback,
moving him past Broncos Vice President  John Elway  for the
second-most all-time behind  Brett Favre  (186).  Ravens Rally  The Baltimore Ravens rallied past the San Diego Chargers
16-13 as Justin Tucker kicked a 38-yard field goal with 1:07
left in overtime. The Ravens (9-2) erased a 13-3 fourth-quarter
deficit by scoring 10 points in the final five minutes,
including another 38-yard kick by Tucker to force overtime.  The  Cleveland Browns  beat Pittsburgh for the second time in
their past 18 meetings, winning 20-14 at home as the Steelers
had eight turnovers. The Browns improved to 3-8, while the
Steelers lost their second straight game without starting
quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger  to drop to 6-5.  Charlie Batch threw three interceptions for the Steelers,
while four different running backs each had a fumble for
Pittsburgh. It was the team’s most turnovers in a game since a
Sept. 10, 1989, loss to the Browns.  7-4 Colts  The Indianapolis Colts won 20-13 at home against the
Buffalo Bills (4-7) to improve to 7-4 as T.Y. Hilton had a
touchdown reception and a 75-yard punt return for a score. The
 Chicago Bears  ended a two-game losing skid with a 28-10 home win
over the  Minnesota Vikings  as quarterback  Jay Cutler  returned
from a concussion.  The  Miami Dolphins  scored 17 fourth-quarter points,
including a 43-yard field goal by Dan Carpenter as time expired,
to beat the Seattle Seahawks 24-21 in Miami. The Dolphins
improved to 5-6 with their first win in four games and the
Seahawks dropped to 6-5.  The Bengals (6-5) rolled to a 34-10 win over Oakland (3-8)
-- their third straight victory -- to spoil the return of
Raiders quarterback  Carson Palmer  to Cincinnati.  The St. Louis Rams beat the Arizona Cardinals 31-17 as
Janoris Jenkins returned two interceptions for touchdowns, and
the Jacksonville Jaguars held on for a 24-19 victory over the
Tennessee Titans (4-7), their first win in six home games.  Houston had improved to 10-1 with a 34-31 overtime win over
the Detroit Lions on the Nov. 22 Thanksgiving holiday, the same
day the Washington Redskins won 38-31 at the Dallas Cowboys and
the New England Patriots cruised to a 49-19 rout of the host New
York Jets.  Eagles-Panthers  The Week 12 schedule concludes tonight with the
Philadelphia Eagles (3-7) hosting the Carolina Panthers (2-8).  Last night in New Jersey, the Giants opened a 31-10
halftime lead and rolled to the victory.  Andre Brown and  Ahmad Bradshaw  added rushing touchdowns for
New York, while the Giants’ defense had five sacks of Packers
quarterback  Aaron Rodgers , who threw an interception and also
lost a fumble. The Packers fell to 7-4 with the loss.  “Hopefully we can remember this feeling and not have this
kind of embarrassment happen again,” Rodgers said at a news
conference. “It was not the way we wanted to play. We’re better
than this and we’re going to regroup.”  Kaepernick, who made the start for the 49ers in New Orleans
even though  Alex Smith  was cleared for contact after missing
last week’s game with a concussion, threw for one touchdown and
ran for another score. Ahmad Brooks and Donte Whitner also had
49ers’ touchdowns off interceptions by Saints quarterback Drew Brees.  San Francisco improved to 8-2-1, the second-best record in
the National Football Conference. New Orleans (5-6) had won five
of its previous six games following a 0-4 start.  The Falcons increased their lead over the Buccaneers (6-5)
and Saints in the NFC West by ending Tampa Bay’s four-game
winning streak.  Matt Ryan  passed for 353 yards, threw an 80-yard
touchdown to Julio Jones in the third quarter and directed the
Falcons’ fifth fourth-quarter rally this season.  In a game that featured six lead changes,  Michael Turner 
put Atlanta ahead for good with a 3-yard touchdown run with 7
minutes, 55 seconds remaining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
