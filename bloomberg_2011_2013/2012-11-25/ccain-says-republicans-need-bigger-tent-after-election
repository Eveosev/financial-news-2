Republican losses in U.S. elections this month show the party needs “a bigger tent” and “a much more positive agenda,” Senator  John McCain  said today.  “It can’t be just being against the Democrats” including President  Barack Obama , McCain, an  Arizona  Republican who opposed Obama for the White House in 2008, said on “Fox News Sunday.”  Republicans “obviously” need to push for an overhaul of immigration laws, McCain said. Obama won backing from 71 percent of Hispanic voters on Nov. 6 against Republican challenger  Mitt Romney , up from 67 percent in 2008, according to national exit polls that underscored the importance of that fast-growing voting bloc. Democrats also augmented their majority in the Senate and gained seats in the  House of Representatives .  “There is no doubt whatsoever that the demographics are not on our side, and we’re going to have to give a much more positive agenda,” McCain said.  McCain suggested that Republicans should place less emphasis on opposing abortion and be more tolerant of voters who back abortion rights. Republicans lost Senate races in Indiana and  Missouri  partly because their nominees made controversial comments about rape and abortion.  “I can state my position on abortion, but other than that, leave the issue alone” amid discussion of economic and national security issues that are more important, McCain said.  “I’m proud of my pro-life position and record,” he said. “But if someone disagrees with me, I respect your views.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Greg Giroux in Washington at   ggiroux@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at   skomarow1@bloomberg.net
