Philadelphia 76ers center  Andrew Bynum  is out indefinitely with bone bruises in both knees and
weakened cartilage, General Manager Tony DiLeo said.  “This healing process -- it’s hard to predict. Bottom line
is Andrew is out indefinitely,” DiLeo said in a video on the
team’s website. “There are no timelines; we just have to wait
and see how Andrew reacts to the rehab.”  The 76ers took a chance when they acquired Bynum in August
from the  Los Angeles Lakers  in a four-team trade, DiLeo said.  “At the time of the trade, we had four doctors look at his
MRI; we knew it was a calculated risk,” DiLeo said. “We also
knew we were getting the second-best center in the league, a
franchise-type player. We took that risk.”  DiLeo said Bynum, who may have aggravated his injury when
he went bowling recently, has been told not to engage in any
activities that could cause stress to his knees.  Bynum is in the final year of his contract that pays him
$16.5 million, ESPN said.  Bynum, 25, averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds during
the 2011-12 regular National Basketball Association season.  The 76ers (7-6) lost 116-109 last night to the Oklahoma
City Thunder (10-4).  To contact the reporter on this story:
