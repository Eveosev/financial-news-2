The daughter of Houston Rockets
coach Kevin McHale died yesterday afternoon, team owner Leslie
Alexander said in a statement.  Alexandra McHale, who was known as Sasha, was 22 and had
been hospitalized since Nov. 10 with lupus, a disease of the
immune system,  USA Today  reported on its website. McHale began a
leave of absence the same day and the National Basketball
Association team has since been led by assistant coach Kelvin
Sampson.  “I extend my deepest condolences to Kevin and Lynn for the
loss of their beautiful daughter, Sasha,” Alexander said. “Our
entire organization is mourning the McHale family’s loss and we
ask that you keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
