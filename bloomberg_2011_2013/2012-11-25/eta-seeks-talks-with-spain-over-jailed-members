ETA, the Basque terror group that
last year declared an end to attacks, called for talks with the
Spanish government to work out how it will disarm and address
the future of those members who are in jail or on the run.  Agreement on those issues “would bring a definitive end to
the armed confrontation,” ETA said in a statement issued to the
Basque newspaper  Gara .  ETA accused the Spanish government of backing away from its
commitment to negotiate a full settlement since the group
renounced violence last year. Spanish police, in collaboration
with colleagues in  France  and the U.K., have maintained their
pursuit of ETA operatives since last year’s declaration
arresting at least six suspects this year.  Failure to reach an accord would create “a real risk of
the process reaching a dead end,” the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
