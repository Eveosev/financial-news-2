South Korean consumer confidence
rebounded from a nine-month low this month as the economy began
to show signs of improvement.  The  sentiment index  was at 99 from 98 in October, the  Bank
of Korea  said in an e-mailed statement today. A reading below
100 indicates pessimists outnumber optimists.  Unemployment fell to the lowest since 2008 last month as
gains in exports and industrial output signaled growth may pick
up from the weakest pace in three years in the third quarter.
Risks for Asia’s fourth-largest economy include record  household
debt  and strength in the won, which threatens to weigh on
exporters’ sales.  The Bank of  Korea  cut borrowing costs twice this year and
the government boosted spending within its budget to support the
economy. Today’s report showed that people expect inflation of
3.3 percent over the next year, within the range of between 2.5
percent and 3.5 percent that the central bank is targeting for
the next three years.  The  consumer confidence  index is based on responses from
2,006 households in 56 cities, with the survey conducted by mail
and telephone between Nov. 12 and Nov. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
