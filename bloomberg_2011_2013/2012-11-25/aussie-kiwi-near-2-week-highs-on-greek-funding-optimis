The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars traded near their strongest levels in two weeks as
speculation euro-area finance ministers will unlock bailout
funds for  Greece  boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie and kiwi were supported as Asian
shares rose after U.S. stocks had the biggest weekly rally in in
five months amid the  holiday shopping season .  Australia ’s dollar
was near a two-week low versus its New Zealand counterpart as
some economists and investors forecast the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will lower borrowing costs at a gathering next month.  The European ministers’ meeting “might be a little bit
supportive for Aussie and kiwi if something positive comes
out,” said  Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based currency strategist
at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s biggest lender.
“The good news is already in there. I think they might see a
little bit of upside, but not a great deal.”  The Australian dollar bought $1.0454 as of 5:23 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0461 on Nov. 23, when it rose as high as $1.0471,
the most since Nov. 7. The currency’s three-month implied
volatility dropped to 7.3 percent, the lowest since July 2007.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 82.35 U.S. cents
after reaching as high as 82.51 near the end of last week, also
the strongest since Nov. 7.  Australia’s  10-year yield  dropped to 3.261 percent from
3.295 percent last week when the rate touched 3.302 percent, the
most since Oct. 26. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed
payment made to receive floating rates, fell 0.02 percentage
point to 2.635 percent.  Stock Gains  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares climbed 0.3 percent
after the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. stocks rallied 3.6
percent last week, the biggest five-day advance since the period
ended June 8.  Finance officials from the 17-nation euro region gather
today in Brussels after an all-night meeting and a European
Union summit last week. The held a conference call on Nov. 24 to
prepare for the meeting, where the ministers are expected to
discuss ways to come up with 10 billion euros ($13 billion) to
fill the financing gap that emerged when Greece this month got
two more years to meet deficit-reduction targets.  In Australia, central bank officials will probably lower
the overnight cash-rate target to 3 percent from 3.25 percent,
according to the median estimate of economists  surveyed  by
 Bloomberg News  before policy makers meet on Dec. 4.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 64 percent chance borrowing costs will decline 25 basis
points next month.  New Zealand’s central bank officials will gather for a
policy decision two days after the RBA’s meeting. Governor
Graeme Wheeler, who took over from Alan Bollard in September,
will probably keep the  policy rate  at a record-low 2.5 percent,
a separate poll showed. The rate has been unchanged since March
last year, after an earthquake in February that struck
Christchurch, the nation’s third-largest city, and the
surrounding Canterbury province, killing 185 people.  The Australian dollar was little changed at NZ$1.2694 after
touching NZ$1.2681 on Nov. 23, the weakest since Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
