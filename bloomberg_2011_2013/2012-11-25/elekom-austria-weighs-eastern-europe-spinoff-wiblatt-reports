Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  is considering a
spinoff of its Eastern European assets to protect its interests
if  Carlos Slim â€™s America Movil SAB, its biggest outside
investor, pushes for expansion in the region, WirtschaftsBlatt
 reported , citing an unnamed source.  The spinoff would cause state holding company OIAG to lose
influence over the Eastern European business or exit it
altogether, allowing Slim to put more capital into the non-
Austrian business, the newspaper said today on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
