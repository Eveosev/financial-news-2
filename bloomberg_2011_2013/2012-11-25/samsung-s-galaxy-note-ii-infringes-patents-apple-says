Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sought to add infringement claims over six more  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  products including the Galaxy Note II to its multibillion-dollar patent lawsuit against the South Korea-based company.  Apple has said that Samsung products running on the new Android “Jelly Bean” operating system, and other products running on the “Ice Cream Sandwich” system should be added to the case, according to filings in San Jose federal court in  California . Jelly Bean is  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s latest version of the Android operating system that runs on Samsung mobile devices.  Apple Nov. 23 asked the court to add to its case the Galaxy S III, running the new Jelly Bean system, the Galaxy Tab 8.9 Wifi tablet computer, the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 and the Rugby Pro and Galaxy S III mini, according to court papers.  “Apple has acted quickly and diligently to determine that these newly released products do infringe many of the same claims already asserted by Apple, and in the same way that the already-accused devices infringe,” the Cupertino, California- based computer-maker said in its filing.  The claims were filed as part of a second patent suit between the mobile-device giants in  San Jose  federal court in which Samsung is targeting Apple’s iPhones, iPad and iPod Touch devices, while Apple has named more than 20 Samsung devices.  In an earlier lawsuit that went to trial in July, a jury found that Suwon-based Samsung infringed six of seven Apple patents at issue and awarded $1.05 billion in damages.  First Case  In the first case, U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh scheduled a Dec. 6 hearing for Apple’s bid for a permanent U.S. sales ban on eight Samsung smartphone models and the Tab 10.1 tablet computer. She will also consider Samsung’s bid to get the verdict thrown out based on claims of juror misconduct.  Nam Ki Yung, Samsung’s Seoul-based spokesman, declined to comment on the filing.       The newer case is Apple v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 12-cv-00630, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). The previous case is Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Jose).
