Zambia, Africa’s biggest copper
producer, said it’s losing as much as $2 billion annually to  tax
avoidance , with the mining industry the biggest culprit.  Only one or two mining operations are actually declaring
positive earnings, Deputy Finance Minister Miles Sampa told
reporters in Lusaka today.  “The other mines for one reason or another, some genuine,
some not, are always making losses,” Sampa said. “Most of it
is due to transfer pricing or tax avoidance. We’re looking at
developing a law that will criminalize false reporting.”  Zambia’s governing Patriotic Front has opted not to impose
a windfall levy on miners in favor of optimizing tax collection
and doing away with fiscal incentives.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,
Vedanta Resources Plc,  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and  First
Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM)  all operate mines in the country.  Businesses commonly avoid paying tax through  transfer
pricing , which distorts inter-division transactions so that a
Zambian subsidiary appears to suffer a loss, Sampa said. In
other cases, parent companies have loaned money to local units
at interest rates higher than the market, creating losses.  A change in the law is being pursued to close loopholes
that cost Zambia at least $1.5 billion a year, said Sampa.  “How many hospitals can that build?” he asked “How many
roads can that help us to develop?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
