South Africa remains 353 runs short
of its victory target after slumping to 77-4 in its second
innings at close of play on yesterday’s fourth day of the second
Test against Australia in Adelaide.  Australia earlier declared on 267-8 in its second innings,
setting South Africa a record 430 to win, with  Michael Hussey 
scoring 54.  Australia can overtake the Proteas atop the International
Cricket Council’s Test rankings by claiming the three-Test
series. The opening match in Brisbane was a draw.  South Africa’s innings got off to a difficult start as
captain Graeme Smith edged a ball from  Ben Hilfenhaus  to Ricky Ponting at second slip without scoring.  Nathan Lyon then claimed the first of his two wickets when
Hashim Amla was caught by Michael Clarke at slip. Soon after,
Jacques Rudolph was caught by  Ed Cowan  at short leg to give the
spinner another dismissal.  Alviro Petersen, on 24, was then bowled by Peter Siddle
before AB de Villiers, 12 not out, and Faf du Plessis, 19 not
out, took the visitors to the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
