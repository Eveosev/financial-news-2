Director Jeff Long fired head football coach John L. Smith.  “With our 2012 football season concluded, I met earlier
today with Coach John L. Smith to inform him we would be making
a change in leadership within our football program,” Long said
on the school’s website. “He made a difficult decision in
uncertain times to return from his alma mater to guide the young
men in our football program, and I will always be grateful for
his efforts.”  Smith, a former Michigan State and Louisville coach, was
hired away from Weber State in April to replace the fired Bobby
Petrino and signed to a 10-month contract. After a new coach is
hired Smith will be reassigned as a consultant through the end
of his deal on Feb. 23, 2013, Long said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
