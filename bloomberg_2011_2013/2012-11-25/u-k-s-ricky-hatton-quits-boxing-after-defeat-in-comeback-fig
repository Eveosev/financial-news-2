U.K. boxer Ricky Hatton retired for
the second time after being knocked out in the ninth round of
his comeback fight by Ukraine’s Vyacheslav Senchenko.  Hatton, the 34-year-old “Hitman,” was floored by a body
punch last night in his home town of Manchester, northwest
 England .  He’d come out of retirement after a 3 1/2-year gap
following a second-round knockout by  Manny Pacquiao  of the
Philippines in  Las Vegas . That defeat meant Hatton lost his
International Boxing Organization light-welterweight title.  “A fighter knows when it’s not there any more, and it’s
not there,” Hatton told reporters last night. “I’m not going
to put myself through that torture again, and I’m not going to
put my family through it.”  Hatton’s only other loss in 48 fights was against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in December 2007.  In 2005, he beat Russian-born Australian Kostya Tszyu to
win the International Boxing Federation light-welterweight title
and later held the World Boxing Association’s light-welter and
welterweight crowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
