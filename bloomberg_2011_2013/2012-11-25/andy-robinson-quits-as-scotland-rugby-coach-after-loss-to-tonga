Andy Robinson quit as coach of
 Scotland ’s national rugby team, a day after an upset 21-15 loss
to Tonga in Aberdeen.  Robinson, 48, had been in the post 3 1/2 years. Yesterday’s
defeat followed losses to  New Zealand  and South Africa in a
sequence of 10 defeats from the past 13 matches.  In all, Robinson lost 19 of his 35 matches, and his team
came bottom in this year’s Six Nations championship with defeats
in all five of its games.  Robinson, previously coach of England, had been under
contract to Scotland until after the 2015  World Cup .  “I’m very angry,” he told the British Broadcasting Corp.
after yesterday’s game. “There will be consequences because of
this performance. It reflects on me.”  In a statement today, former Bath and  England  player
Robinson said he believed he’d left the Scotland team in a
better position than when he took over.  “I am very disappointed by our recent results but I have
belief in the players to develop into a winning team,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
