The former Edinburgh home of Harry
Potter author  J.K. Rowling  was sold to a Scottish-based
businessman for an undisclosed sum.  The Victorian two-story, eight-bedroom town house in the
upmarket Merchiston area of the Scottish capital stands in its
own grounds with a walled garden. It sold after 21 days of going
on the market on Sept. 20 for offers over 2.25 million pounds
($3.6 million), realtor  Rettie & Co.  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The agent didn’t disclose the price.  The property, a 30-minute walk from Edinburgh Castle,
attracted more than 16,000 unique visitors to Rettie’s website
with 65 percent coming from outside the U.K., the majority from
the U.S. and  Asia , the agent said. The only people who viewed
the house were Scottish-based businessmen, it said.  Rowling, 47, started writing the Harry Potter boy wizard
series in cafes in Edinburgh, staying in the city after the
books turned her into a multimillionaire. The first one was
 published  in June 1997.  The author, who moved into a new home in the Scottish
capital last year, bought the top half of the house in 1999
before purchasing the ground floor from her neighbour and
returning it to a two-story town house. Built in 1880, the house
includes an annexe that’s been turned into an office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
