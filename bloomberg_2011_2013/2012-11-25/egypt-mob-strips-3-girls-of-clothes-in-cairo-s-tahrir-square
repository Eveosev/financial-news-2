A mob of about 300 Egyptian youths
ripped the clothes off three young women in Cairo’s  Tahrir
Square  today, forcing them to take refuge in a government
building, the state-run Ahram Gate reported.  The youths attempted to force their way into the building,
known locally as the Mugamma, after assaulting the women near a
downtown Cairo mosque, the website reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
