Shoppers turned out in bigger
numbers and boosted purchasing over the Black Friday weekend,
lured by promotions online and in stores, the  National Retail
Federation  said today.  Customers spent $423 on average, a 6.3 percent increase
from $398 last year, Washington-based NRF said in an e-mailed
statement. Starting Thanksgiving Day, 89 million Americans
visited stores and websites, up from 86 million a year earlier,
for total spending of $59.1 billion.  More than 35 million shoppers bought in stores and online
on the Thanksgiving holiday, up from 29 million last year, to
get a few hours’ jump on the traditional Black Friday. With the
earlier openings, online deals starting as far back as last
weekend and new promotions, stores are trying to draw customers
to return for later purchases, said Scott Tuhy, a credit analyst
for Moody’s Investors Service in  New York .  “The promotional message is very important this weekend
for retailers focused on the whole season, not just the four-day
Thanksgiving weekend,” Tuhy said today by telephone.
“Consumers are looking for deals. They’re going to spend what
they’re going to spend for the holiday, so it’s important for
retailers to get the value message across this weekend.”  The results are from a survey conducted Nov. 23-24 for the
federation by BIGinsight, which polled 4,005 consumers. The
survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
