Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull
clinched a third straight Formula One drivers’ title with a
sixth-place finish at today’s Brazilian Grand Prix.  The 25-year-old German is the youngest-ever three-time
winner. His nearest rival in the standings, Ferrari’s Fernando
Alonso, came second behind McLaren’s Jenson Button in the 71-lap
final race of the season at the Interlagos circuit in Sao Paulo.  Vettel had a 13-point lead on Alonso going into today’s
race. He’s the third man to win three titles in a row after
Michael Schumacher and Juan Manuel Fangio.  Vettel surpasses Ayrton Senna’s mark as the youngest three-
time champion. The Brazilian was 31 when he achieved the feat in
1991.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
