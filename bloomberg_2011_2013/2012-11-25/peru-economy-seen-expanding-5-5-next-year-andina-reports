Peru ’s economy will expand 5.5
percent next year, overcoming international volatility because
of its strong reserves, low debt and private and public
investment, the Inter-American Development Bank said,  according 
to news agency Andina.  The expansion would follow this year’s 6 percent growth,
Andina said, citing an interview with Fidel Jaramillo, the
development bank’s representative in Peru.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
