Paul Tucker , one of the Bank of
England’s two deputy governors, is the favorite to replace
 Mervyn King , with a decision to be made as early as this week,
the Sunday Times  said , citing unidentified government sources.  There’s pressure from ministers to finalize the appointment
of the incoming governor before the Chancellor of the
Exchequer’s autumn statement, according to the U.K. newspaper.
Other candidates for the role, responsible for setting interest
rates and regulating banks, insurance companies and fund
managers, are Lord Terry Burns and John Vickers, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
