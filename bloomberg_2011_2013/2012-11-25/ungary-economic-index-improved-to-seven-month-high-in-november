Hungary ’s  economic-sentiment  index
improved to seven-month high in November on rising business
confidence and a more optimistic consumer outlook.  The sentiment index rose to minus 22.4 from minus 24.6 in
October, the GKI research institute in Budapest said in an e-
mailed statement. The  business-confidence  index advanced to
minus 12.4 from minus 14.6 while the  consumer confidence  gauge
jumped to minus 50.7 from minus 53.  The economic index, which has displayed “slight
fluctuations” following a plunge in May, still remained below
April’s levels, which were the strongest reading this year, GKI
said.  Hungary’s  economy  is mired in its second recession in four
years as gross domestic product shrank 1.5 percent from a year
earlier in the third quarter. The country requested
 International Monetary Fund  aid a year ago as its  credit rating 
was cut to junk.  Standard and Poor’s lowered its credit score for Hungary to
BB on Nov. 23, two steps below investment grade, saying the
government’s “unorthodox” policies were eroding medium-term
economic-growth prospects.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
