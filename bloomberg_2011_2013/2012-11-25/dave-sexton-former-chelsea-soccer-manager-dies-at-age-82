Former Chelsea and Manchester United
soccer manager Dave Sexton has died at age 82.  Sexton led Chelsea to winning the F.A. Cup in 1970 and the
Cup Winners’ Cup the following year, the Blues’ first European
trophy. In 1976 he guided Queens Park Rangers to a second-place
finish in the English league behind Liverpool before moving to
United a year later.  He went on to two spells as coach of the England Under-21
team, helping the side to European titles in 1982 and 1984. He
also coached Coventry City.  “It is a sad day for English football,” Trevor Brooking,
the Football Association’s director of football development,
said in a statement. “Anyone who was ever coached by Dave would
be able to tell you what a good man he was, but not only that,
what a great coach in particular he was. His coaching was
revered.”  Sexton began his managerial career at Leyton Orient after
playing for clubs including West Ham, Orient and Brighton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
