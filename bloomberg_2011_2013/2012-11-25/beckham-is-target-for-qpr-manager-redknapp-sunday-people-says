Harry Redknapp, who was appointed as
manager of Queens Park Rangers yesterday, wants to sign  David Beckham  for the struggling Premier League soccer club, the
Sunday People reported.  Redknapp tried to sign the 37-year-old 18 months ago while
in charge at Tottenham and is now set to compete with clubs in
China, Australia and the Middle East for the former England
captain, the newspaper said. Beckham will end his stint with the
Los Angeles Galaxy next month.  Redknapp’s priority, though, is a loan move for Tottenham
midfielder Scott Parker, the People said, without citing anyone.
Parker’s teammates Jermain Defoe and Michael Dawson are also
targets, the newspaper said.  Parker, 32, has not played this season because of an
Achilles tendon injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
