Liverpool drew 0-0 at Swansea in
English soccer’s Premier League today as Reds manager  Brendan Rodgers  returned to his former club for the first time since
moving to Anfield this year.  Liverpool’s Luis Suarez had a scoring chance with eight
minutes to go but shot straight at goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel
from a pass by Raheem Sterling, who’d earlier hit the bar. Then
Jonjo Shelvey’s shot was saved by Tremmel.  Later today, defending champion Manchester City plays at
Chelsea, Southampton hosts Newcastle and Tottenham plays West
Ham.  Yesterday, Manchester United took the league lead with a 3-
1 win over bottom club Queens Park Rangers. West Brom won 4-2 at
Sunderland, Stoke defeated Fulham 1-0 and Reading lost 3-2 at
Wigan. Arsenal drew 0-0 at Aston Villa and Everton tied 1-1 with
Norwich.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
