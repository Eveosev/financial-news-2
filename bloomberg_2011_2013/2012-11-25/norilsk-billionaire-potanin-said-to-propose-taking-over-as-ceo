OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the world’s
larget producer of the metal, may replace Chief Executive
Officer Vladimir Strzhalkovsky with billionaire shareholder
 Vladimir Potanin , three people familiar with the matter said.  Potanin is seeking to maintain control of Russia’s largest
mining company amid discussions with fellow Norilsk shareholder
United Co. Rusal, headed by fellow billionaire  Oleg Deripaska .  Strzhalkovsky is aware of the main shareholder’s desire to
replace him, Norilsk’s press service said in reply to e-mailed
