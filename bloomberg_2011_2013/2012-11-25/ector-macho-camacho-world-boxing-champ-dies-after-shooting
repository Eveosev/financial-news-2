Hector “Macho” Camacho, a former
world boxing champion, died four days after he was shot in his
native Puerto Rico. He was 50.  Camacho was on life support at Centro Medico trauma center
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, the Associated Press reported, citing
Ernesto Torres, the hospital’s director. Torres said Camacho
suffered cardiac arrest early yesterday, was taken off life
support, and died shortly thereafter, the wire service said.  Camacho was shot Nov. 20 while sitting in the passenger
seat of a parked car outside a bar in Bayamon, his hometown. The
bullet struck Camacho in the jaw and exited his head before
lodging in his right shoulder and fracturing two vertebrae, the
AP cited Torres as saying.  The car’s driver also was killed in the shooting, the AP
said. No arrests have been made and no motive for the shooting
has been disclosed.  Camacho was born on May 24, 1962, in Bayamon, part of the
San Juan metropolitan area.  He won super lightweight, lightweight and junior
welterweight world titles in the 1980s and retired in 2010 with
a 79-6-3 career record,  according to  the Ring magazine’s
website.  His career included fights against Felix Trinidad, Julio Cesar Chavez and Sugar Ray Leonard. He knocked out Leonard in
1997, ending Leonard’s final comeback attempt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
