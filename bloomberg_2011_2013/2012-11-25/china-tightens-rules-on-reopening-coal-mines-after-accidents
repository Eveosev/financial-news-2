China, the world’s biggest producer
and user of coal, tightened standards for reopening suspended
mines, according to a  statement  from the State Council.  Mines that don’t meet the necessary safety requirements
shouldn’t resume operations under any conditions, the council
said in yesterday’s statement, citing illegal reopenings as the
cause of several deadly accidents recently.  China suspended operations at smaller coal mines earlier
this month to boost safety ahead of a once-in-a-decade
leadership transition, and policy makers are moving to improve
standards after spate of accidents. Eighteen people were killed
yesterday at a mine in the southwestern province of Guizhou.  Small mines with little resources and that don’t meet
safety standards shouldn’t easily receive permits to reopen, the
council said. Larger mines without necessary safety technology
should consider merging with bigger companies that do, it said.  China ’s raw-coal production climbed 4.9 percent to 2.5
billion tons in the first eight months of the year, according to
China Coal Resource data. In 2010, China recorded 2,433 coal-
mine deaths, 7.5 percent fewer than a year earlier, according to
the State Administration of Work Safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
