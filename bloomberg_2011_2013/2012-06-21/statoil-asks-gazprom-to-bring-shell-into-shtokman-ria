Statoil ASA (STL)  wants  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  to become the main foreign partner in development of the
Shtokman offshore natural gas project in Russia, RIA Novosti
reported.  Statoil sent a letter to OAO Gazprom proposing the change,
the Russian  news agency  reported, citing an unnamed person
familiar with the matter. Gazprom owns 51 percent of Shtokman
Development AG, Statoil owns 24 percent and France’s  Total SA (FP) 
owns 25 percent. The report didn’t say if Statoil is seeking a
replacement for Total or to reduce the company’s stake in the
project.  Total Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie said
earlier today his company is happy with its 25 percent holding
in the project.  The three companies may start talks about their roles in
the project next week, the agency said, citing an unnamed
speaker at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
