JBS SA (JBSS3)  shareholders agreed to swap
118 million shares for  Vigor Alimentos SA (VIGR3)  stock, less than the
world’s biggest beef producer sought to exchange as it spins off
the dairy unit.  Investors received one share of Vigor for each of JBS at an
auction held at the  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3)  securities exchange in Sao
Paulo, which disclosed the results by e-mail today. The swap,
where JBS had planned to exchange as many as 149.7 million
shares, valued Vigor at 1.19 billion reais ($579.5 million), or
7.96 reais per share.  JBS is spinning off Vigor as Brazil’s growing middle class
increases consumption of yogurt and margarine. The company is
looking to more than triple the unit’s sales to 5 billion reais
by 2015 through acquisitions and new plants, JBS Chief Executive
Officer Wesley Batista said on Dec. 19.  JBS said on May 18 that the Batista family’s FB
Participacoes SA, which controls the meatpacker, would hold 44.6
percent of Vigor shares after the swap. The Brazilian
 development bank , which owns 31.4 percent of JBS, would have as
much of Vigor if it chose to swap all the shares.  The BM&FBovespa didn’t disclose how much each JBS
shareholder holds in Vigor after the auction.  JBS fell 4.7 percent to close at 6.05 reais in  Sao Paulo 
after the auction results were announced. Brazil’s benchmark
Bovespa index dropped 2.9 percent. Vigor will start trading
tomorrow in Sao Paulo.  JBS declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
