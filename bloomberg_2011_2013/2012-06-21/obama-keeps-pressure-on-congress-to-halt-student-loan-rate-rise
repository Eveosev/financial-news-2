President  Barack Obama  sought to
turn up the pressure on Congress to prevent a doubling of
student loan interest rates in 10 days.  “‘‘It’s mind-boggling that we have this stalemate in
Washington,’’ Obama said at the White House. ‘‘Congress has had
the time to fix this for months.’’  Unless Congress acts by July 1, the  interest rate  on new
loans will rise to 6.8 percent from the current 3.4 percent,
increasing costs for more than 7 million students and adding an
average of $1,000 to college debt, according to the White House.  Freezing interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans for
another year would cost almost $6 billion, according to the
 Congressional Budget Office . The House passed a bill April 27 to
avert the rate increase, sending it to the Senate.  Lawmakers and the White House are in a dispute over how to
pay for it. The administration has threatened to veto the House-
passed bill because it would end a public-health fund to pay for
the rate freeze.  Republican leaders in Congress,  Mitch McConnell  in the
Senate and Speaker John Boehner in the House, sent the White
House on May 31 a list of what they said were bipartisan offers
on how to fund the rate freeze. The administration hasn’t
responded.  To contact the reporters on this story:
