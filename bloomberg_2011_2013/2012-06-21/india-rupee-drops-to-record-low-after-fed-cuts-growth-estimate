India ’s rupee fell to a record low
after the  Federal Reserve  lowered its economic growth estimate
for the U.S., damping the outlook for the Asian nation’s
exports.  The Indian currency touched 56.5550 per dollar and closed
0.3 percent weaker at 56.3075 at close in Mumbai, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Fed said yesterday U.S. economic growth in 2012 would
be between 1.9 percent and 2.4 percent, from an April projection
of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said on June 19 the central bank may have to
sacrifice expansion to temper inflation. Overseas investors  sold 
an average $113.3 million more local equities a day than they
bought this month, compared with net sales of $112.5 million in
May and $203 million in April, exchange data show.  “There is sustained weakness on the global macroeconomic
economic front and positive developments aren’t likely,” said
J. Moses Harding, executive vice-president at IndusInd Bank Ltd.
in Mumbai. “The rupee’s weakness will persist.”  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  expanded 5.3 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in nine
years, the government said on May 31. Wholesale prices rose 7.55
percent in May from a year earlier, after gaining 7.23 percent
in April, official data show. Policy makers need to curb
inflation, which is at “disturbing” levels, the RBI’s Subbarao
said in a June 19 speech in Mumbai.  Three-month  offshore  non-deliverable forwards traded at
57.46 a dollar, compared with 57.29 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
