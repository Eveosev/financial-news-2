Colour Vision, ridden by Frankie Dettori, won today’s Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, the feature race
on the third day of the horserace meeting.  The 6-1 chance, a four-year-old trained by Saeed bin
Suroor, held off the challenge of Opinion Poll (5-1) by half a
length to win the 198,000-pound ($310,000) first prize.
Saddler’s Rock (9-2) was third in the 2 1/2-mile race.  The first two horses are from Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s Godolphin stable, whose jockey Dettori had the choice
of which one to ride.  “This was my best chance of the week. I had a decision to
make,” Dettori told reporters. “They’re both great horses,
both great warriors and I finished up the best, but only by a
short margin.”  Race officials held an inquiry after Colour Vision and
Opinion Poll, ridden by Mickael Barzalona, came close together
on the run-in but left the result unchanged.  Fame And Glory, the 4-5 favorite, was unplaced in its
attempt to secure a second straight win in the event.  Five-day Royal Ascot, held in Berkshire west of  London , is
Britain’s richest race meeting, with prize money of 4.5 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
