Albert Hu, a  California  hedge-fund
manager, was convicted by a federal jury of seven counts of mail
fraud for running an investment scheme that targeted Chinese-
American business leaders in Silicon Valley.  Hu, 50, who founded and operated hedge funds Asenqua Beta
Fund and Fireside LS Fund out of offices in  San Francisco ,
Sunnyvale, California, and Singapore, lied to investors when he
promised returns of 20 percent to 30 percent and said his funds
were affiliated with a prominent law firm and auditor, U.S.
Attorney Melinda Haag in San Francisco said today in a
statement.  Investors lost millions of dollars, most of which went to
pay Hu’s personal expenses and prior investors and others,
prosecutors said. A federal jury in  San Jose  convicted Hu
yesterday after a three-week trial, Haag said.  Jerry Fong, an attorney for Hu, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment on the verdict.  Hu was arrested in  Hong Kong  in 2007 and extradited to the
U.S., where he has been in custody. He is scheduled to be
sentenced in September and faces as much as 20 years in prison
and a $250,000 fine plus restitution.  The case is U.S. v Ke-Jeng Hu, 09-487, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
