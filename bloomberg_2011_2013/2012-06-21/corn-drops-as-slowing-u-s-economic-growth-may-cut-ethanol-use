Corn fell in  Chicago  on concern a
record harvest in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso state may add to a supply
glut and on speculation slowing U.S. economic growth will cut
demand for grain used to make ethanol.  Mato Grosso’s second-season corn crop is expected to be
“super-sized,” climbing to 13.1 million metric tons from 6.9
million tons in 2010-11, Soybean & Corn Advisor wrote June 19.
World stockpiles are expected to reach the highest level in more
than a decade in 2012-13 on a record crop in the U.S., the
country’s Department of Agriculture estimates.  “Brazil is expecting a record corn crop of its own this
season,”  Dave Norris , an independent grain trader from
Harrogate,  England , wrote in a market comment. “Theirs is on
the market now, with local reports suggesting a really good
second crop is on the cards.”  Corn for December delivery slid 1.5 percent to $5.58 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:50 p.m. in Paris.
Prices jumped 12 percent, the most since April 2011, in the past
three days.  Weaker growth in the U.S. has curbed  demand  for fuel. Crude
oil reached an eight-month low today after the country’s
stockpiles unexpectedly climbed to the highest in 22 years.
About a third of the U.S. corn harvest is used to produce
ethanol that’s blended into gasoline.  “The economic indicators remain disappointing, both in the
U.S. as well as for  China ,” Paris-based farm adviser Agritel
wrote in a market report. “This translates particularly in a
continuation of the decline in  oil prices .”  U.S. ethanol  inventories  had a 2.5 percent weekly gain in
the week to June 15, according to the Energy Department.  Wheat for September delivery declined 0.9 percent to $6.77
a bushel after a three-day, 9 percent climb. November-delivery
milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in the French capital slipped
0.4 percent to 211.75 euros ($268.31) a ton.  November-delivery soybeans lost 0.9 percent to $13.825 a
bushel in Chicago. The oilseed advanced 6.6 percent in the past
four sessions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
