An Indonesian air force plane
carrying seven people crashed into houses in Jakarta during a
training flight.  The twin-engine Fokker F-27 turboprop went down near Halim
Perdanakusuma Airport today, said Azman Yunus, an air force
spokesman. The cause of the crash isnâ€™t clear and victims are
being rushed to a hospital, he said by phone.  Eight houses were set on fire following the crash, Yunus
said separately on Metro TV. The accident would be the fifth
fatal plane crash in  Indonesia  in the past year, based on a
Flight Safety Foundation  website .  Last month, 45 people were killed in the country when a
Russian-made Sukhoi SuperJet crashed during a promotional flight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
