College football’s Bowl Championship
Series commissioners reached agreement on a four-team seeded
playoff structure for the 2014 season.  The proposal will be presented to the Presidential
Oversight Committee, which has the final say, the BCS said on
its website. The university presidents meet June 26 in
 Washington .  “We are excited to be on the threshold of creating a new
postseason structure for college football,” the statement,
attributed to BCS commissioners and Notre Dame Athletic Director
Jack Swarbrick, said. “We are getting very close and we look
forward to next week’s meeting.”  The BCS commissioners have met five times to discuss a
playoff model since the championship game on Jan. 9, when the
 University of Alabama  won its second national title in three
years with a 21-0 victory over Louisiana State at the Superdome
in  New Orleans .  Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany told ESPN that the group is
“unified” although there are some issues that have not been
finalized.  “There’s always devil in the detail, from the model to the
selection process, but clearly we’ve made a lot of progress,”
Delany said.  The commissioners divulged few details on their website
ahead of the meeting with the university presidents.  The semifinals under the proposed championship would rotate
among the major bowls, the  Associated Press  reported, citing
people familiar with the BCS decision. A selection committee
would help pick the schools competing in the four-team playoff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
