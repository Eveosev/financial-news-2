Carlos Divar, the chief justice of
Spain’s  Supreme Court , resigned after facing accusations that he
misused public money.  The court’s governing committee will begin the process of
choosing a successor as soon as the resignation is published in
Spain’s official gazette, the court said in an e-mailed
statement.  Five members of the court called for Divar to step down
last week after El Pais newspaper reported he’d used public
money to pay for weekend breaks at luxury hotels on the Spanish
coast. Divar filed 28,000 euros ($35,000) of expenses claims for
32 trips over four years, El Pais said.  “I am not aware that I have done anything wrong but the
situation was unsustainable,” the newspaper cited Divar as
saying at an emergency session today of  Spain ’s judicial
council, which Divar also headed. He said he’s been a “victim
of a cruel and disproportionate campaign,” the newspaper
reported.  Court hearings won’t be affected by the change, the
statement said. The Supreme Court and the Judicial Council
didn’t respond to calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
