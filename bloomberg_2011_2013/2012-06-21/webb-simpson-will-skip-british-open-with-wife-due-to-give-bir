U.S. Open winner  Webb Simpson  won’t
try for consecutive major golf championship victories at the
British Open, instead staying with his wife as they await the
birth of their second child.  Simpson’s wife, Dowd, is due in late July and the British
Open, at Royal Lytham & St. Annes in Lancashire, England, runs
from July 19-22.  The Simpsons’ first child, 16-month-old James, arrived
before his due date and Simpson didn’t want to risk taking the
chance that Dowd would go into labor early.  “After winning, it’s certainly a little harder not to go
because I’d love to go and try to win another major,” Simpson
told reporters yesterday at the Travelers Championship at TPC
River Highlands in Cromwell,  Connecticut , according to a
transcript of his remarks. “But in the grand scheme of things
and scheme of life, it’s a decision I know I’ll always be happy
that I made.”  Simpson, 26, became the ninth consecutive first-time winner
at a golf major on June 17, topping  Michael Thompson  and Graeme McDowell by one stroke at the Olympic Club in San Francisco.  England’s  Darren Clarke  won the 2011 British Open. The 43-
year-old missed this year’s U.S. Open because of a groin injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
