The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will trim exports as Gulf producers led by
 Saudi Arabia  pare a surge in output, according to tanker-tracker
Oil Movements.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of global supplies,
will reduce shipments by 20,000 barrels a day to 23.92 million a
day in the four weeks to July 7, compared with 23.94 million to
June 9, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
data exclude  Angola  and  Ecuador . The group pledged to constrain
supplies at a meeting last week in order to comply better with
its collective production target.  “The Gulf generally is going down with the Saudis in the
lead,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by telephone from
Halifax, England. “It’s been an unusual second quarter in that
sailings have gone down from beginning to end, and that is a
result of high  Middle East  sailings at the beginning.”  Exports from the Middle East, including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will slip 0.5 percent to 17.58 million barrels a
day in the four-week period, according to Oil Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 496.81 million barrels,
up 3.9 percent from the month to June 9, the researcher said.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude crude held on board ships used
as floating storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
