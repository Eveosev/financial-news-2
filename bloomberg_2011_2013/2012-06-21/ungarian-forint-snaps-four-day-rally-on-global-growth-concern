The forint weakened for the first
time in a week as a cut in the  Federal Reserve ’s U.S. growth
estimate deepened concern the global economy is slowing.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 287.27 per
euro by 10:04 a.m. in Budapest, after strengthening to a six-
week high yesterday. Hungary’s benchmark five-year bonds
weakened, lifting yields three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 8.003 percent.  Federal Reserve officials reduced their estimates for 2012
growth after last month’s slowdown in hiring and see little
progress on unemployment during the rest of the year, according
to projections released yesterday. The Fed will expand its
Operation Twist program to extend the maturities of assets on
its balance sheet and said it stands ready to take further
action against unemployment.  Currency markets in central  Europe  “may be somewhat
disappointed” by the Fed statements, Andras Oszlay, a Budapest-
based analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a research report.  Hungary’s government has submitted an amendment to a
disputed central bank law, which should pave the way to the
start of talks on an International Monetary Fund-led aid deal,
 Mihaly Varga , the minister in charge of aid talks, said in
Budapest today.  “The local news flow remains favorable but it didn’t
manage to give the forint another boost,” Levente Blaho and
Adam Keszeg, analysts at  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote
in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
