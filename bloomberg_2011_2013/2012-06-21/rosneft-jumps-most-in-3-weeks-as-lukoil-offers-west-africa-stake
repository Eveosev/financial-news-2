OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, rose the most in more than three weeks as smaller
competitor OAO Lukoil offered the state-run company stakes in
projects in West Africa.  Rosneft jumped 2.8 percent to 207.39 rubles by 5:28 p.m. in
Moscow, the biggest advance on a closing basis since May 29. The
30-stock Micex Index gained 0.4 percent to 1,379.97.  Lukoil invited Rosneft to participate in projects in West
Africa in exchange for access to the Russian offshore, Andrei
Kuzyaev, the head of Lukoil’s overseas unit, said today at the
 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum .  To contact the reporter on this story:
