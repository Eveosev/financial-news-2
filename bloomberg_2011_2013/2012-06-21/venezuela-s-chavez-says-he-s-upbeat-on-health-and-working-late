Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ,
speaking on state television, said he’s feeling healthy and
staying up till midnight signing papers, making phone calls and
walking.  “This morning I looked at my face and said to myself,
’Hey, you look healthy, Hugo Chavez,’” Chavez, who is suffering
from an undisclosed cancer, said last night.  Chavez, 57, spoke for three hours after speaking for about
10 hours last week, including another three-hour speech June 11
to kick off his October re-election bid as he tries to dispel
doubts about his ability to govern for another six years while
battling cancer.  Chavez maintained his lead over opposition candidate
Henrique Capriles Radonski in a poll conducted this month by
Datanalisis. Chavez had 42.6 percent and Capriles 28.8 percent
in a Datanalisis telephone survey of 702 people taken June 12-15
that had a margin of error of 3.7 percent, according to an e-
mailed copy of the survey. The poll found 28.6 percent of voters
were undecided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
