Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ,
seeking to return his country to growth and make good on his
pledge to liberalize the economy, is pushing parliament to pass
a bill to ease firing rules.  “The vote could come between Tuesday and Wednesday,” June
26 or June 27, said Elsa Fornero, Monti’s labor minister, today
in a press conference in Luxembourg. “I, too, hope parliament
will soon approve a reform that has many positive aspects and is
on the whole balanced.”  Monti is urging lawmakers to give companies more
flexibility to hire and dismiss workers as Italy sinks deeper
into its fourth recession since 2001. His draft law was signed
by President Giorgio Napolitano in April. Fornero said that
month that the details would be worked out by the government and
the state pension agency by June 30.  The final vote is expected on June 27, according to the
parliament.  Italy ’s economic growth has lagged the euro-area average
for more than a decade and will contract 1.4 percent this year,
according to a forecast by the European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
