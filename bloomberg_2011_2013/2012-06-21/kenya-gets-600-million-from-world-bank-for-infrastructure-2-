The  World Bank  is lending Kenya $600
million to upgrade Nairobi’s metropolitan infrastructure and
modernize the water and sewer systems to keep up with rapid
growth in the East African nation’s cities.  The bank will give $300 million alongside $330 million from
the government to improve sewers, roads, public spaces and other
services in Nairobi, the capital, World Bank Country Director
Johannes Zutt said in an e-mailed statement today.  “Migration to the city is continuing at a rapid pace,” he
said. The project will help meet the growing infrastructure
demand “so that it remains a livable and business-friendly city
as well as an engine of future economic growth.”  Nairobi, the region’s financial and commercial hub, is home
to 17 percent of  Kenya ’s population, according to the World
Bank. The city contributes 60 percent of the gross domestic
product in  East Africa ’s largest economy, which generated $32.2
billion in 2010, according to the World Bank.  “The mass urbanization will require connectivity with 13
commuter rail stations proposed for construction, upgrading
public infrastructure and constructing and rehabilitating
strategic roads,” Finance Minister Robinson Githae told
reporters today in Nairobi.  Kenya will also receive a $300 million loan to upgrade
water and sanitation systems in its biggest cities and fight
drought, Zutt said. Drought-related damage from 2008 to 2011
cost Kenya $12 billion, he said. The World Bank has already
invested $150 million in the project, which started in 2007.  Both loans are for 40 years and have a grace period of 10
years, Zutt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
