French Socialist lawmaker Claude Bartolone was chosen today at a party caucus to preside over the
National Assembly, Agence France-Presse reported today.  Lawmakers will confirm the choice in a June 26 vote, the
news service said. The Socialist Party won a majority in the
lower chamber of parliament June 17, when Bartolone won a
lawmakerâ€™s seat for the Seine-Saint-Denis constituency.  He will be the fourth most important political figure in
 France  according to official protocol.  To contact the reporters on this story:
