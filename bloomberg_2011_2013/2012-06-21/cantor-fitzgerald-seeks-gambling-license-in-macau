Cantor Fitzgerald LP, which runs
sports gambling in seven  Las Vegas  casinos, is seeking a gaming
license in Macau, China, as it looks to expand in sports betting
beyond Nevada, Chief Executive Officer  Howard Lutnick  said.  “We’re in the process of getting licensed in Macau,”
Lutnick said today on Bloomberg Television. “When you have
these big casinos as your partners, it makes it much more
easy.”  The New York-based company’s sports-gambling technology
enables players to bet while games are in progress, even on
individual plays, Lutnick said. Sports betting in Las Vegas has
increased 13 percent this year “because we gave people
something new and better,” he said.  In Macau, the only place in China where wagering is legal,
gambling revenue rose 7.3 percent in May to 26.1 billion patacas
($3.3 billion), compared with a year earlier, according to the
city’s Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau. Cantor would
run sports betting operations in Macau casinos if it got a
license there, Lutnick said.  The broker has invested $150 million in retooling sports
books in Las Vegas casinos. Its investments there include
casinos owned by  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , which also operates in
Macau.  To contact the reporters on this story:
