Cyprus is in negotiations with the
European Union for a possible rescue package, while it also
looks into the prospect of loans from an individual nation,
Cypriot government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said today.  “We are in continuous touch and dialogue with the European
partners and EU’s institutions and work simultaneously in the
direction of securing a bilateral loan from another country,”
Stefanou said in a statement on the website of the Press and
Information Office.  “Cyprus’s government continues to implement its decisions
related to strengthening the Cypriot economy, which stands on
sound foundations and when the time comes, final decisions will
be taken, always in a dialogue, fine-tuning a cooperation with
the EU,” the east Mediterranean island’s government spokesman
said.  Cyprus, which has been shut out of markets since May last
year, is pursuing a loan from other nations, including Russia,
and also considering requesting aid from the euro-area’s
firewall funds in order to finance the recapitalization of its
banking sector, hurt in writedowns of Greek government debt held
by banks. Euro area finance ministers who are meeting in
Luxembourg tonight may discuss the prospect of extending
financial rescue to the euro area’s third-smallest economy.  Lawmaker Nicholas Papadopoulos told reporters in Nicosia
today after the finance committee hosted the chairman of Cyprus
Popular Bank, Michael Sarris, in a closed meeting, that “the
bank continues to face some difficulties related to its
recapitalization,” without giving further details. The island’s
government decided in May to underwrite the issue of 1.8 billion
euros ($2.3 billion) in preference shares of its second largest
lender, Cyprus Popular.  State-owned radio  CyBC  reported today that it can’t be
ruled out that  Russia ’s financial aid to Cyprus may be
accompanied by the demonstration of interest by Russian
entrepreneurs to invest in Cypriot banks. CyBC cited no source.  To contact the reporters on this story:
