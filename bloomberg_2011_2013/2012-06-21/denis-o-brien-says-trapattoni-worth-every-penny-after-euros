Irish billionaire  Denis O’Brien  said
his contribution to Irish soccer manager’s Giovanni Trapattoni’s
salary was “probably one of my better investments” even after
the team lost all three games in the European Championship this
month.  “He was worth every penny,” O’Brien said in an interview
with Bloomberg Television due to air today.  O’Brien agreed to provide “generous support” to help pay
for Trapattoni’s two-year contract extension, the Football
Association of Ireland said last year. The Irish Independent
reported Trapattoni’s annual salary to be 1.5 million euro with
O’Brien contributing half.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
