Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, cut its
2012 earnings forecast as the strength of the dollar hurts sales
generated abroad by the maker of Marlboro cigarettes.  Earnings per share this year will be $5.10 to $5.20 based
on prevailing rates, the New York-based company said in a
statement today, compared with an April forecast of $5.20 to
$5.30.  Philip Morris  said currency shifts will cut 25 cents from
EPS, more than the 15 cents forecast in April.  The  U.S. dollar  has gained 4.5 percent against the euro in
the past two months. Philip Morris, created in 2008 when  Altria
Group Inc. (MO)  spun off its businesses outside the U.S., got 39
percent of  revenue  from the European Union in 2011.  Philip Morris fell 2.4 percent to the equivalent of $86.39
in  European trading  as of 8:47 a.m. London time. The stock was
little changed at $88.51 in  New York  yesterday.  Philip Morris also said today that it has made progress on
next-generation tobacco products that may transform the industry
and allow it to enter the Chinese market.  “We are on the eve of what we all believe could be a
paradigm shift for our industry and for PMI, in particular,”
Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri said in the text of a
speech that he will make to investors today. Such products have
“the very real potential to not only be a game-changer, but
also be the key to unlock several hitherto virgin territories,
most notably the huge Chinese market.”  The forecast cut was “not a big deal,” as it had been
anticipated, said  Erik Bloomquist , an analyst at Berenberg Bank.
“What is really important is that PMI is getting ready to
commercialize next-generation products, with factories being
built, and it is confident that the science base they have
developed is robust enough to move forward.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
