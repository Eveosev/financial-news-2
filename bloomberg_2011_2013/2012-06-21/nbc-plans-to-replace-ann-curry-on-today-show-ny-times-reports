 NBC executives are preparing to
replace Ann Curry as a co-host on “Today,” after the morning
show’s lead slipped against ABC’s “Good Morning America,” the
New York Times reported.  Curry, 55, began discussing a different job with the
network several weeks ago, the Times said, citing people with
knowledge of the negotiations. She was elevated to co-host one
year ago, opposite Matt Lauer, succeeding Meredith Vieira.  “Today,” which pioneered the morning-show format, has
seen its ratings dominance imperiled by “Good Morning
America,” which beat it over several weeks this year. The show
is important to  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s  NBC Universal  because of the
profit generated by its hundreds of millions of dollars in
annual advertising revenue, the Times said.  Robert Barnett, Curry’s attorney, and Megan Kopf, a
spokeswoman for “Today” in New York, declined to comment.  Comcast, based in Philadelphia, is the largest U.S. cable
operator and holds a controlling stake in NBC Universal, the
entertainment company that includes the NBC network,  Universal
Pictures  and cable channels USA, CNBC and Bravo.  Comcast shares  fell  0.4 percent to $31.19 yesterday in New
York. They have climbed 32 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
