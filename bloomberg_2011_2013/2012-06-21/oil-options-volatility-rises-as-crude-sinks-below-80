Crude-oil options volatility gained
a second straight day as concern that the global economy is
slowing pushed underlying futures below $80 for the first time
in eight months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 33.7 percent at 12:50 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , up from 31.5 percent yesterday.  “Volatility is definitely pretty well bid again because of
the price breakdown below $80,” said Fred Rigolini, vice
president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude oil for August delivery fell $2.18, or 2.7 percent,
to $79.27 a barrel at 12:58 p.m. on the Nymex, after touching
$79.07, the lowest intraday price since Oct. 5.  Oil slid after reports that manufacturing weakened in
 Europe ,  China  and the Philadelphia region in the U.S. and after
U.S. jobless claims fell less than projected. The Federal
Reserve yesterday reduced its forecasts for growth and
employment, noting “significant downside risks” to the
economy.  The most active oil options in electronic trading today
were November $50 puts, which rose 16 cents to 34 cents a barrel
at 12:56 p.m. with 5,745 lots trading. August $70 puts were the
second-most active options, with 3,187 lots changing hands as
they advanced 22 cents to 51 cents.  Bearish Bets  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.
