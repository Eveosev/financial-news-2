French Open tennis champion  Rafael Nadal  signed a sponsorship deal with PokerStars, both parties
said today.  “I’ve joined the team at PokerStars to learn to play
poker,” the Spaniard said on his Twitter account.  World No. 2 Nadal “will be aiming to take the same drive
and passion he’s shown on the courts with him to the virtual
felt,” the online poker company said on its website. In a
PokerStars video, Nadal speaks to the camera and asks poker
players to give him their “best advice” on how to win.  Since winning his first Grand Slam title in 2005, the 26-
year-old Nadal has become one of the world’s leading sportsmen.
The 11-time major singles champion is endorsed by companies
including  Nike Inc. (NKE)  and Korean carmaker Kia Motors Corp. Forbes
estimated his annual off-court earnings at $25 million. Nadal
has made more than $50 million in prize money in his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
