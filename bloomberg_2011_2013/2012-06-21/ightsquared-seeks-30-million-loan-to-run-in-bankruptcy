An affiliate of LightSquared Inc.,
 Philip Falcone ’s bankrupt wireless broadband venture, is seeking
to borrow as much as $30 million to keep operating while under
court protection from creditors.  LightSquared would guarantee repayment of the proposed loan
to One Dot Six Corp., which would use the money to help make
lease payments and finish building projects related to the
broadband effort, according to court papers filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. One Dot Six is among a group
of LightSquared affiliates, known as the “Inc. Obligors,”
which need funding to keep operating in bankruptcy. Another
group of “LP” affiliates is using cash that had been set aside
as collateral.  Failing to get financing “would irreparably harm the Inc.
Obligors, their estates, their creditors, and equity holders,
and the possibility for a successful reorganization,”
LightSquared said in court papers.  The company, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed bankruptcy
last month, with plans to try to resolve concerns of U.S.
regulators who thwarted the company’s attempt to deliver high-
speed wireless service to as many as 260 million people.  Harbinger  Capital Partners , Falcone’s New York-based hedge
fund, had invested about $3 billion in LightSquared and owned
about 74 percent of it as of Jan. 27.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-12080,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
