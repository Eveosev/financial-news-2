Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.28 percent yesterday after trading
from 0.14 percent to 0.28 percent and averaging 0.16 percent,
according to ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The central bank will acquire $4.25 billion to $5.25
billion of securities maturing from June 2018 to May 2020,
according to the New York Fed’s  website . The purchases are part
of the Fed’s program to replace $400 billion of short-term debt
in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to
reduce borrowing costs further and counter rising risks of a
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
