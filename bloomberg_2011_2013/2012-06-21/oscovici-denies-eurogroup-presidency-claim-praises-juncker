French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  denied reports that he’s seeking the presidency of the
euro group and signaled support for keeping Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  for now.  German newspaper Handelsblatt reported yesterday that
French President Francois Hollande intended to nominate
Moscovici for the post.  “I was surprised to read this,” Moscovici told reporters
as he arrived at a euro group meeting in Luxembourg today.
“It’s flattering but there are other possibilities. I think
notably that Jean-Claude Juncker presides very well. I want to
repeat that here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
