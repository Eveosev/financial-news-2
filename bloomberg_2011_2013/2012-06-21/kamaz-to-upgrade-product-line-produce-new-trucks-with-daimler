OAO KamAZ, the Russian truck maker
partly owned by  Daimler AG (DAI) , will upgrade its product line
through 2014 and produce new trucks designed jointly with the
German company, General Director Sergei Kogogin said.  The company wants the government to set a maximum tax for
imported commercial vehicles more than three years old after
Russia’s membership in the World Trade Organization takes effect
this year, Kogogin said in an interview in St. Petersburg,
Russia today.  The company has always worked in a “high-competitive
market,” Kogogin said, and is ready for WTO membership. Still,
local producers need extra security the maximum tax rate to
foreign-made vehicles would bring to stay competitive, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
