Khartoum State Governor Abdel Rahman
Khedr dissolved his Cabinet as part of  Sudan ’s austerity
measures, which have sparked five days of student protests.  Khedr said in an interview that he decided yesterday to
dissolve the government of the state that houses the capital to
comply with measures President Umar al-Bashir announced June 18
to cope with the loss of about 75 percent of the country’s oil
output when  South Sudan  seceded in July.  About 200 students gathered at the University of Khartoum
early today to prepare for another anti-government rally. Police
fired tear gas and warnings shots yesterday to disperse
protesters, who responded by throwing rocks and chanting,
“Khartoum rise up, rise up, we won’t be ruled by a thief.”  “I urged the police forces in Khartoum to deal with
protesters according to the law, but to deal firmly with any
unlawful activity in the name of protest,” Khedr said in his
office today.  The decline in Sudan’s oil income resulted in a $2.4
billion  budget deficit  and a surge in inflation to 30.4 percent
last month.  The measures announced by al-Bashir include devaluing the
Sudanese pound to 4.4 a dollar from 2.7 now, removing fuel
subsidies, raising taxes and cutting the size of the national
and regional governments by as much as 56 percent.  Khedr said he will trim the new Cabinet to six or eight
state ministers from 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
