New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, declined for a second day as
commodities fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut growth
estimates and a report showed  China ’s manufacturing may shrink.  The stock retreated 0.4 percent to 102.59 koruna by 10:01
a.m. in  Prague , after earlier slumping as much as 2.8 percent.
Europe’s benchmark  coal  futures contracts slid 1.1 percent to
$95.70 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
