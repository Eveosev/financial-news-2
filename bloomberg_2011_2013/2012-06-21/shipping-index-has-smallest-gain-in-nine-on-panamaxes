The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of
shipping costs for commodities, had its smallest increase in
nine sessions as demand and rates declined for ships designed to
navigate the Panama Canal.  The gauge rose 0.6 percent to 978 points, according to the
 Baltic Exchange  in  London , the least since June 8. Panamax
vessels fell 1.8 percent to $8,543 a day. The three other ship
types that make up the index all rose.  The number of Panamax bookings declined, Rahul Kapoor, a
Singapore-based analyst at RS Platou Markets AS, an investment
bank, said in an e-mailed note today.  Rates are slumping as the fleet swells faster than the
amount of cargoes. Supply of Panamaxes will expand 14 percent
this year as seaborne trade in commodities swells 4 percent,
according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the worldâ€™s largest shipbroker.  Rates for Capesizes that carry about 180,000 metric tons of
cargo, about twice as much as Panamaxes, rose 1.8 percent to
$3,550 a day. Smaller Supramaxes gained 1.9 percent to $12,207;
Handysizes rose 0.8 percent to $10,189.  To contact the reporter on this story:
