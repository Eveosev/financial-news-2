Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
second-biggest maker of personal computers, fell the most in
more than two years in Hong Kong trading after a report said the
company lowered its guidance for shipment growth this year.  Lenovo fell as much as 9.4 percent to HK$6.77, the most
since Feb. 5, 2010. The stock has gained 32 percent this year,
outperforming the 4.9 percent increase in Hong Kong’s benchmark
Hang Seng Index.  Lenovo told suppliers that shipment growth this year will
be between 13 percent and 15 percent, compared with an earlier
guidance of as much as 25 percent, China Times reported without
saying where it got the information. Angela Lee, a spokeswoman
at Lenovo in  Hong Kong , didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail
and calls to her mobile phone seeking comment.  “The company may miss out on back-to-school season sales
this year” as consumers wait for computers fitted with
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s planned upgrade of the Windows operating
system, said Jean-Louis Lafayeedney, who rates Lenovo neutral at
JI Asia in Hong Kong.  Lenovo expects to increase revenue by between 10 percent
and 20 percent in the year ending March 2013, helped by demand
in  emerging markets , Chief Financial Officer Wong Wai Ming said
last month. The company will also post improvements in its
profit margins, he said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
