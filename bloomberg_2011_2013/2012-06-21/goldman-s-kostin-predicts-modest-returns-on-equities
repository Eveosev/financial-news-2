Equity markets will probably climb 8
percent a year for the next decade, even though economic concern
will subdue returns in 2012,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s chief
U.S. equity strategist said.  “Near term, I think there’s more concern regarding many
asset classes -- equities in particular -- because of the issues
and the headwinds in terms of the economy, in terms of
valuation, in terms of modest earnings growth,”  David Kostin 
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today with  Tom Keene 
and Sara Eisen. “I think those are the issues that you’re
looking at now to the end of 2012. Longer term, statistically,
you should do OK.”  Kostin said negative earnings revisions at major companies
and U.S. economic stagnation will hold back stocks this year.  Federal Reserve officials yesterday predicted growth of 1.9
percent to 2.4 percent this year, down from their April forecast
of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the economy remained vulnerable to fiscal tightening and any
worsening of the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis. The  Federal
Open Market Committee , which has kept its  benchmark interest
rate  near zero since December 2008, reiterated yesterday that it
expects to keep rates “exceptionally low” at least through
late 2014.  Kostin said portfolio managers increasingly look at
dividends when investing in equities.  “The scarcest asset in the world is income right now,” he
said. “You have big increases coming in technology; they will
be the largest sector in terms of payers of dividends.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
