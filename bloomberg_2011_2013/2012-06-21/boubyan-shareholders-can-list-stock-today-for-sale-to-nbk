Boubyan Bank KSC (BOUBYAN)  shareholders who
want to sell their stock as part of a 580.6 million-dinar ($2.1
billion) offer by  National Bank of Kuwait SAK  can list their
shares starting today, according to an ad in local newspapers.  Sellers have until July 22 to register at the  Kuwait
Clearing Co. KSC , according to the advertisement published in
 Al-Qabas  today.  NBK, the country’s largest lender and holder of 47.3
percent of Boubyan, said on June 14 it offered 630 fils a share
for the stock it doesn’t own. Boubyan Bank’s board said in a
filing to the Kuwait Stock Exchange yesterday that the offer is
“fair and appropriate.” The central bank approved NBK’s
request to extend the acquisition offer to Oct. 8, the lender
said on June 20.  Two analysts recommend investors sell their Boubyan shares.
Eight analysts say investors should hold NBK shares, while one
has a sell rating on the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
