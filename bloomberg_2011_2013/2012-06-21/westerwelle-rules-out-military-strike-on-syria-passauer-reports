German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  said Germany won’t take part in any deliberations
about possible military intervention in  Syria ,  Passauer Neue
Presse  reported today, citing an interview.  Germany won’t do anything that might “ignite a
conflagration with unforeseeable consequences for the entire
region,” the newspaper cited Westerwelle as saying.  The German government is convinced that a political
solution for Syria is necessary and that the chances of reaching
one still exist, though the situation is difficult, Westerwelle
said, according to Passauer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
