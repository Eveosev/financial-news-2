U.S. stocks retreated after a gauge
of Philadelphia manufacturing shrank more than forecast and
sales of existing homes declined.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.4 percent to
1,350.67 at 10:03 a.m. in  New York .  The  Federal Reserve  Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index fell to minus 16.6 in June from minus 5.8 the previous
month. Economists forecast the gauge would improve to zero, the
dividing line between growth and contraction, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The report covers
eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey  and Delaware.  Purchases of existing properties dropped 1.5 percent to a
4.55 million annual rate last month, figures from the National
Association of Realtors showed today in Washington. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
4.57 million pace.       U.S. stocks dropped yesterday, following a four-day gain in
the S&P 500, as the Federal Reserve cut its estimates for growth
amid a slowdown in hiring and extended its stimulus program
known as Operation Twist.  The Fed lowered its central tendency estimate for U.S. 2012
gross domestic product growth to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent from
2.4 percent to 2.9 percent in April.  The  S&P 500  has rebounded more than 6 percent after sinking
to a five-month low on June 1 when Labor Department data showed
the weakest U.S. employment growth in a year.  Jobless claims decreased by 2,000 to 387,000 in the week
ended June 16, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for 383,000. The four-week average, a less
volatile measure, climbed to the highest of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
