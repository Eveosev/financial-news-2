The French government will restrict
an increase in the minimum wage to no more than 2 percent,  Les
Echos  reported, without citing anyone.  An official decision will be taken by June 26, when the
government is due to meet with labor unions and employers, the
newspaper said. An increase as of July 1 will take the gross
hourly minimum wage to 9.40 euros ($11.80),  Les Echos  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
