Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, rallied in extended trading as the bank was
downgraded two levels by Moody’s Investors Service rather than
the three-grade cut that the ratings firm said was possible.  The bank climbed 4.6 percent to $14.60 at 5:24 p.m. in New
York.  Moody’s had said it may reduce the  rating  on the New York-
based firm by as many as three levels as part of an industrywide
review. Morgan Stanley can manage through any potential cut,
Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  said June 12 at an investor
conference in New York.  Donald Jones, a Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. analyst, said in a
June 19 note that the most likely outcome expected by bond
investors was a three-grade rating cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
