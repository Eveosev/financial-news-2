United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s 5.16
billion-euro ($6.5 billion) cash offer for  TNT Express NV (TNTE)  begins
tomorrow and runs through Aug. 31 as the U.S. company seeks to
expand in  Europe  with the biggest deal in its 105-year history.  TNT Express, which agreed to accept the bid of 9.50 euros a
share on March 19, will hold an investor meeting in Amsterdam on
Aug. 6 to brief its shareholders on the takeover, the companies
said today in a joint statement.  UPS, the world’s largest package-delivery company, will
vault into equal footing in Europe with Deutsche Post’s DHL, the
market-share leader, following the takeover of TNT, which it
reiterated today will produce pretax cost savings of 400 million
euros to 550 million euros annually after four years.  “The transaction will create a global leader in the
logistics industry with more than $60 billion in annual revenue
and an enhanced, integrated global network,” the companies said.  UPS reiterated that it’s seeking acceptance of the deal
format least 80 percent of shareholders in Hoofddorp,
Netherlands-based TNT, spun off last year from Dutch postal
operator  PostNL NV (PNL) , which is tendering its 29.8 percent stake.  The 9.50-euro UPS bid is 5.6 percent higher than a prior 9-
euro approach and 54 percent more than the closing price on Feb.
16, the day before talks were made public.  The agreed deal valued TNT at 13 times its previous four
quarters’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, versus a median of 10 times trailing Ebitda in
nine similar deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Atlanta-based UPS closed little changed at $78.17 yesterday
and has gained 6.8 percent this year, valuing the company at
$75.2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
