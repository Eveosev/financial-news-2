Almost 16,800 adverse events
associated with metal-on-metal hip implants were reported in the
U.S. from 2000-2011, regulators said.  The reports almost quadrupled to 682 in 2008 from the year
earlier, and rose again after a unit of  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  began
recalling hip devices in 2010, according to report posted today
on the  Food and Drug Administration ’s website. Adverse event
reports in 2011 totaled 12,137 for the metal-on-metal devices,
compared with 6,332 associated with other types of hip implants,
according to the FDA document.  J&J faces more than 6,000 lawsuits related to the hip
devices in federal and state courts. The ASR hips from the  New
Brunswick , New Jersey-based company account for 9,006, or 74
percent, of the incident reports in 2011, according to the FDA’s
document. J&J recalled 93,000 ASR hips worldwide in 2010,
including 37,000 in the U.S., saying more than 12 percent of the
devices failed within five years.  The FDA plans to convene advisers on June 27 and 28 to
examine the safety of metal-on-metal hip implants. The agency is
expected to release additional documents June 25.  The most-reported side effect was revision, meaning surgery
to remove or replace the implant. Revisions totaled 14,131 in
metal-on-metal hip implants followed by 8,704 reports of pain.  Metal-on-metal hip implant use peaked in 2006 and 2007 at
an estimated 30 percent of the market and is now about 10
percent,  Matthew Taylor  an analyst at Barclays Capital Inc.,
said in a telephone interview. Other implants include those made
of ceramic and polyethylene.  If the FDA restricts metal-on-metal implants, companies
such as Biomet Inc., based in Warsaw,  Indiana , won’t be
significantly affected, Taylor said.  “Most of the companies have a full line of hip products
they can sell so they’d just be swapping it out with the other
hip products,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
