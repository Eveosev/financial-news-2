  LivePerson Inc. (LPSN)  dropped the most in
more than six months after the Israeli provider of real-time
chats and voice customer-service softwareâ€™s U.S.-traded shares
declined following a recommendation cut.  The stock  retreated 6 percent, the most since Dec. 15, to
67.50 shekels, or the equivalent of $17.41, at 11:15 a.m. in  Tel
Aviv . The New York-traded shares fell 7.8 percent to $17.37
yesterday after shares were reduced to neutral from buy at
Janney Montgomery with a share-price estimate of $18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
