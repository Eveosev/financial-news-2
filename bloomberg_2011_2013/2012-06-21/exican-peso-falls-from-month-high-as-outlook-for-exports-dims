Mexico ’s currency dropped the most
in three weeks as evidence of U.S. economic weakness dimmed the
outlook for the Latin American country’s exports.  The peso depreciated 1.5 percent to 13.9159 per dollar at
3:30 p.m. in Mexico City, the biggest drop on a closing basis
since May 31. The currency’s decrease today pared this year’s
gain to 0.1 percent.  The currency slid today after the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia reported that its general economic index fell to
minus 16.6 in June, the lowest level since August, from minus
5.8 in the previous month. Economists forecast the gauge of
regional manufacturing would improve to zero, the dividing line
between growth and contraction, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  “It came out way below what was expected, and this put a
bit of pressure on the peso,” Pepe Curiel, a currency trader at
Intercam Casa de Bolsa SA, said by phone from Mexico City.
“Numbers that come out bad there hit us directly.”  Mexico depends on exports for about 30 percent of its gross
domestic product, sending 80 percent of them to its northern
neighbor.  All 25 of the most-traded emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg dropped against the dollar on demand for a
refuge as U.S. stocks retreated.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 5.60 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased
1.25 centavo to 139.43 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
