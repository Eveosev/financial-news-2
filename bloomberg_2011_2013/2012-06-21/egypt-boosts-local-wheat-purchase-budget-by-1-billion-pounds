Egypt  allocated another billion
Egyptian pounds ($166 million) to finance domestic wheat
purchases and an additional $100 million for fuel, Finance
Minister Momtaz el-Saieed said in an e-mailed statement today.  The funds for fuel raised to $4.65 billion the amount given
to the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., el-Saieed said today.
He didn’t say over what period the funding had been provided.
The ministry had allocated about 8.5 billion pounds for local
wheat purchases through June 21, he said.  The ministry also took “urgent measure” to ensure other
commodities are available, according to the statement.  While the government had budgeted 40 billion pounds for
fuel subsidies from December through May, the actual outlay
amounted to 59 billion pounds, Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri
told journalists last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
