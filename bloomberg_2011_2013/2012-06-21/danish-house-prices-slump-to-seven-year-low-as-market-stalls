Danish  house prices  plunged in the
first quarter to a seven-year low after sellers slashed values
to unload properties that had been on the market for a record-
high number of days.  The average price per square meter fell to 10,897 kroner
($1,857) in the first three months, down 7.4 percent from 11,769
kroner a year earlier, according to data released today by the
Copenhagen-based Association of Danish Mortgage Banks and the
Mortgage Bankers Federation. The average time on the market
before a sale reached 230 days, the highest since the
association began collecting the data in 2004.  The Nordic country’s housing market stalled after a real
estate bubble burst, triggering a regional banking crisis and
helping tip the economy into a  recession  last year. Central bank
Governor Nils Bernstein has warned the market may be in a
negative spiral, with expectations of reductions driving prices
further down.  “There’s an increasing risk that potential buyers will
continue to hold back and postpone a decision to buy a home,”
said Christian Heinig, chief economist at Realkredit Danmark, in
an e-mailed note to investors, citing worsening economic data
and the escalating  European debt crisis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
