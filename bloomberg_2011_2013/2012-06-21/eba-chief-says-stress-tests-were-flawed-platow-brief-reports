European Banking Authority Chairman
Andrea Enria said his institution made mistakes with the
implementation of past stress tests, Platow Brief reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The massive  capital requirements  by Spanish banks, which
almost all passed the last round of stress tests, reveal the
flaws in the methodology, Platow Brief reported. The next round
of stress tests will not happen before end of 2013, and its
methodology hasnâ€™t been decided yet, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
