Indonesia ’s rupiah fell after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will expand its existing stimulus
operations instead of embarking on new measures that may have
spurred demand for emerging-market assets. Bonds advanced.  The Fed will increase its Operation Twist program of
replacing short-term bonds with longer-term debt, while holding
off from broader monetary easing. German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  said she expects a request from Spain in the coming days
for as much as 100 billion euros ($127 billion) in aid for its
banks. Foreign funds have cut holdings of Indonesian stocks by
$183 million this month through yesterday, exchange data show.  “The rupiah is under pressure due to factors from the U.S.
and  Spain ,” said Klara Pramesti, a research analyst in the
treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia in Jakarta. “The
market is disappointed as they expected a new round of
quantitative easing, which would have been positive for riskier
assets.”  The rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 9,481 per dollar as of
9:06 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It has lost 3.3 percent this quarter, the
third-worst performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.
One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, held at 11.50 percent.  The Fed embarked on two rounds of a tactic called
quantitative easing by buying $2.3 trillion of bonds from
December 2008 to June 2011 to boost the  U.S. economy .  The  yield  on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds
dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.23
percent, the lowest level since May 10, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
