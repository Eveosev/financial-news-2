A unit of Ronald Perelman’s
MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc. sued Ira Rennert, claiming he
unjustly enriched himself when a company he controls took
$109 million in loans from a joint venture owned by the two
billionaires.  MacAndrews’s AM General Holdings LLC and a Rennert-owned
company, ILR Capital LLC, share a third company called Ilshar
Capital LLC. Ilshar, managed by Rennert through ILR, wrongly
made loans to another Rennert company between 2009 and last year
on favorable terms that included no required collateral or
payments for five years, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court.  “Rennert was on both sides of the transaction,” AM
General said in the complaint.  Rennert didn’t immediately return a phone message left at
his  New York  office seeking comment on the suit.  Perelman’s MacAndrews bought control of truckmaker AM
General from Rennert’s Renco Group Inc. in 2004. As part of that
transaction, Ilshar was created and capitalized by AM General’s
holding company, which MacAndrews controls, according to the
complaint.  Rennert caused Ilshar to loan Renco money in violation of
Ilshar’s operating agreement, according to the complaint.
Rennert also breached the operating agreement by causing Ilshar
to invest more than $200 million in  hedge funds  alongside Renco
and its affiliates, AM General alleged.  The case is AM General Holdings LLC v. Renco Group, 7639,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
