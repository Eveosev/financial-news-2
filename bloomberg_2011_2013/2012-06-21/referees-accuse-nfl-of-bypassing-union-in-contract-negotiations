National Football League  referees
filed an unfair labor practices charge with the  National Labor
Relations Board , saying the U.S.’s most-popular sport is trying
to bypass their union in negotiations on a new contract.  The NFL sent letters directly to game officials that
“contained inaccurate, false and incomplete information
regarding bargaining issues and proposals,” the NFL Referees
Association said in the charge filed  June 19 with the federal
agency.  “It is clear the league never intended to work toward a
fair agreement, even through mediation,” Michael Arnold, lead
negotiator for the officials, said in a news release. “Now
during a lockout, the NFL is attempting to bypass NFLRA
negotiators by distributing inaccurate and misleading financial
information to all the referees.”  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail that the
referees’ charge had “no merit.”  “It is common for employers during collective bargaining
to provide factual information to employees that has already
been communicated to the union,” Aiello said. “That is all
that was done here.”  The league said this month that it would begin hiring and
training replacement officials after talks aimed at reaching a
new collective bargaining agreement with the union stalled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
