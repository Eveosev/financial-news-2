A European Union plan to temporarily
delay carbon permits sales starting next year may breach the
bloc’s legislation, said Luther Rechtsanwaltsgesellschaft mbH,
the German  law firm .  “The emissions trading directive only grants the EU
commission the right to interfere with the market in case of CO2
prices that are too high to reduce the burden on businesses,”
said Stefan Altenschmidt, head of the environment, planning and
regulatory practice group in Dusseldorf. “The directive does
not allow the commission to work towards a price increase in
case of CO2 rates that are too low,” he said today in a
 statement  on the firm’s website.  The opinion was prepared on behalf of lobby groups
including from the steel, cement, glass and paper industries,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
