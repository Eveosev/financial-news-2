The average cost per claim for
lightning strikes in the U.S. increased 5.5 percent last year,
driven by a rise in the number and value of consumer
electronics.  Lightning strikes cost insurers an average of $5,112 a
claim in 2011, compared with $4,846 the previous year, the New
York-based Insurance Information Institute said today in a
 statement . The number of lightning claims last year fell 13
percent to 186,307 from 2010 and total insured losses dropped
7.8 percent to $952.5 million, the institute said.  U.S. consumers filled their homes with increasingly
expensive electronic devices like flat-screen TVs and smart
phones that can be damaged by lightning storms. Sales of  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone  jumped  81 percent in 2011 to 72 million units from
about 40 million units a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Plasma and high-definition television sets, home
entertainment centers, multiple computer households, smart
phones, gaming systems and other expensive devices -- which can
all be destroyed by power surges -- continue to have a
significant impact on claims losses,” Loretta Worters, the
institute’s vice president, said in the statement.  Average costs per claim rose 93 percent from 2004 to last
year even as the number of paid claims fell by more than a
third, the institute said.  The claims are typically covered by homeowners and business
policies. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and
 Allstate Corp. (ALL)  are the largest U.S. home insurers.  The institute released the data in advance of lightning
safety week, which begins June 24. The institute advises
homeowners to have lightning protection for electrical,
telephone, cable or satellite TV lines entering a structure.  People should stay off the telephone and stay away from
TVs, plumbing and stoves during lightning storms, the group
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
