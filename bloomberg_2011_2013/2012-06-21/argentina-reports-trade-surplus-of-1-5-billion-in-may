Argentina â€™s trade surplus was $1.5
billion in May, compared with $171 million a year earlier, the
national statistics institute said.  The surplus was lower than the $1.9 billion median estimate
of five economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Exports fell 7 percent from the same month a year earlier
to $7.6 billion, while imports fell 5 percent to $6 billion over
the same period, the agency said in Buenos Aires today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
