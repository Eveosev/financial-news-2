climb almost threefold by the end of the month to 12 million
metric tons, said Mykola Bezuhlyi, deputy agriculture minister.  Stocks were 4.3 million tons as of July 1, according to

according to a  statement  published today on the government
website. Exports in the marketing year from July 1 may rise to
