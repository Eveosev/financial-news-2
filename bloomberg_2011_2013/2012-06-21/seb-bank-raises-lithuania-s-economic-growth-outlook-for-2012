SEB Bank AB (SEBA) , Lithuania’s largest
bank by assets, raised its economic-growth outlook for the
country for a second time, citing better-than-expected first-
quarter results and a resilience to Europe’s debt crisis.  The  economy  will probably expand 3.5 percent this year,
compared with a May estimate of 3 percent, the bank said in an
e-mailed report today. Growth may slow to 3 percent in 2013, it
said.  Lithuania’s economy expanded 3.9 percent from a year
earlier in the first quarter, the European Union’s second-
fastest pace after neighboring  Latvia .  The Baltic nation’s output advanced as domestic demand
strengthened and the country’s main export markets of Russia,
Germany, Latvia and Estonia, posted quicker economic growth than
economists predicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
