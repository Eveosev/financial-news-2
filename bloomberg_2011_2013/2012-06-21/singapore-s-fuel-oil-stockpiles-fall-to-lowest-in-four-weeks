Singapore ’s stockpiles of  fuel oil 
fell to the lowest level in four weeks, according to data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 1.8 percent to 19.24 million barrels in the week ended
June 20,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Supplies are at the lowest since the week ended
May 23.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline, fell 2 percent to 11.24 million barrels. Middle
distillates, a category that includes gasoil and kerosene,
dropped 4.2 percent to 8.94 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
