MSCI Inc. is considering including
Israeli stocks to its European index and is seeking feedback
from investors, the New York-based index provider said.  MSCI reclassified Israel as a developed market from
emerging-market status in 2010 and based on “participant
feedback” didn’t include the  MSCI Israel Index (MXIL)  in the MSCI
Europe Index, it said in a statement yesterday. Instead, it
created the MSCI Europe + Middle East Index as a new regional
developed market index.  Upgrades at MSCI could lead to the nation’s equities luring
more of the investor assets that follow the provider’s gauges.
The Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange’s Chief Executive Officer Ester Levanon said in May the bourse is seeking to move to the MSCI
Europe index to boost trading volumes. An e-mailed message sent
to the bourse seeking comment wasn’t immediately replied today.  “The addition of Israel to any significantly tracked MSCI
index should be a market positive,” Saar Golan, the head of
equities trading at Clal Finance Batucha Brokerage Ltd., said in
an e-mail today. “Israel would be a minor component, but it
would mean an inflow of funds into MSCI Israel stocks.”  The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  has risen 26 percent since June
2009 when MSCI announced the upgrade to developed-market status.
That compares with a 61 percent rally for the  Nasdaq Composite
Index. (CCMP)   To contact the reporter on this story:
