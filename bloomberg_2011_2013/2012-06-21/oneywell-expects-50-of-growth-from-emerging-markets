Honeywell International Inc. (HON) , whose
products range from auto parts to fire alarms, expects at least
half of growth over the next five years to come from  emerging
markets  because of urbanization and expanding energy industries.  “Developing more than 50 percent of our growth from high-
growth regions is reasonable,” Shane Tedjarati, head of global
high-growth regions, said in an interview in Shanghai today.
“An increasing amount of the world’s industrial output and GDP
and growth are coming from these places.”  In China, the company expects “good double-digit growth”
for the next five years, Tedjarati said, as more people move to
cities and buy more  carpets , cars and security systems.
Expansion in China and  India  has helped Morris Township, New
Jersey-based Honeywell boost the share of sales it gets from
overseas to 54 percent from 41 percent in 2002, according to its
 annual report .  The oil and gas sector will play a leading role in
Honeywell’s expansion in  emerging markets , Tedjarati said. The
company is seeking to expand in regions including Indonesia, the
 Middle East , Russia, Brazil and energy-rich parts of Africa, he
said. Honeywell’s energy products include systems for refining
and processing crude oil.  Honeywell has invested $600 million in China, where it
employs more than 11,000 people, according to its  website .
Tedjarati was the company’s China head before being promoted to
the global emerging-markets role in January.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
