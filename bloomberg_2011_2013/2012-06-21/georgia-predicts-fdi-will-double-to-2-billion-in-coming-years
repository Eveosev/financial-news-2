Georgia can attract $2 billion in
foreign-direct investment annually “in a few years,” with 2012
inflows to exceed $1 billion, the Georgian National Investment
Agency said.  “I’m sure this will happen in few years as there’s still
room for many investments,” the agency’s head, Keti
Bochorishvili, said today in an interview in Tbilisi, the
capital. “Areas like tourism, services, finance and hydro power
are examples.”  FDI grew 55 percent from a year earlier in the first
quarter, with Germany accounting for 49 percent of the total,
Bochorishvili said.  The economy expanded 12.3 percent in 2007, when FDI
exceeded $2 billion. It shrank 3.9 percent in 2009 after a five-
day war with  Russia  over the breakaway Georgian region of South
Ossetia the previous year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
