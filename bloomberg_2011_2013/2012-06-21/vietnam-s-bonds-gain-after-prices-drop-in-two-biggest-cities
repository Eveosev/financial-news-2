Vietnam’s bonds gained, snapping
seven days of declines, after prices dropped in the country’s
two biggest cities. The dong strengthened.  Consumer prices fell 0.17 percent in June from May in the
capital of Hanoi and decreased 0.43 percent in the economic hub
of  Ho Chi Minh City , according to a posting on the government’s
website today, citing statistics offices in the two cities.  Low inflation is “a favorable condition for the  State Bank 
of Vietnam to complete its road map for loosening monetary
policy to support credit growth,” Hanoi-based  Bao Viet
Securities Co. (BVS)  analysts including Ha Thi Thu Hang and Ngo Minh
Hoa wrote in a research note yesterday. “Government bond yields
are expected to fall slightly.”  The  yield  on five-year notes declined one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 9.70 percent, after rising for seven
consecutive days, according to a daily fixing from banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,918 per dollar as of 3:20
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
