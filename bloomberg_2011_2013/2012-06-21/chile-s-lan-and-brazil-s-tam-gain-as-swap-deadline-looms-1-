Lan Airlines SA (LAN)  and  Tam SA (TAMM4)  rose as
investors bet a share swap that will result in the creation of
Latam Airlines Group SA will succeed.  Santiago-based Lan, Latin America’s largest carrier by
market value, rose 1.1 percent to 13,642 pesos at the close in
Santiago, its fifth day of gains. Tam,  Brazil ’s biggest airline,
advanced 9.2 percent to a five-year high of 52.50 reais.  “The deadline of the offer to swap shares is close, and we
haven’t seen announcements of people backing from the offer,”
Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst at Santiago-based brokerage
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said by phone. “Investors
seem sure it will be successful.”  Lan said on June 12 it would extend for 10 days its offer
for investors to tender their Tam shares in Brazil for shares in
Latam Airlines, after 94.4 percent of Tam’s stockholders
approved the deal. Lan had initially set a minimum 95 percent
threshold for the deal to be completed.  Three days after the deal is closed, Tam holders will
receive depositary shares in Latam Airlines Group SA, the
company formed by the merger, which would be the world’s most
valuable carrier with a leading position in Brazil.  Santiago-based Inversiones Security set the equivalent of a
buy recommendation for the combined carrier, citing merger
synergies and growth potential in  Latin America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
