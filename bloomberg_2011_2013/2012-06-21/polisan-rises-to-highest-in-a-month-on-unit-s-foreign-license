Polisan Holding AS (POLHO) , a Turkish maker
of paints and dyes, rose to its highest in almost a month after
saying its chemicals unit started talks with foreign companies
for a license.  The stock added 1.4 percent to 2.24 liras at 11:40 a.m. in
Istanbul after advancing as much as 2.3 percent earlier, poised
for its strongest level on a closing basis since the shares
began trading on May 25 after an initial public offering.  The unit, which is seeking a license to produce expandable
polystyrene, is also looking for cooperation in engineering work
for the new product, Polisan said in a statement to the  Istanbul
Stock Exchange  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
