Wescoal Holdings Ltd. (WSL) , the South
African miner that reported a return to profit yesterday, rose
the most in seven months in Johannesburg trading after saying
it’s in talks on two transactions with “large” companies.  Wescoal jumped 19 percent, the biggest one-day gain since
Nov. 4, to close at 81 cents.  The coal producer may conclude talks on two deals with
“large international companies” within six weeks, Chief
Executive Officer Andre Boje told Johannesburg-based broadcaster
Moneyweb yesterday. Wescoal, based in Krugersdorp, posted net
income of 20.6 million rand ($2.5 million) for the year through
March, after a 43.5 million-rand loss a year earlier.  Wescoal plans to increase annual output to 4 million metric
tons by fiscal 2016 from 1.5 million tons, Boje said. The
company expects to win a mining license for its Vlakvarkfontein
project next month and start output at the end of 2012,
producing 1.2 million tons a year, Wescoal said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
