The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for April released
by  Statistics Canada .  The number of people receiving regular Employment Insurance
(EI) benefits decreased for the third consecutive month in April,
down 28,600 (-5.3%) to 513,700.  The number of beneficiaries decreased in nine provinces,
with the largest percentage declines occurring in Quebec,
Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan.  Claims unchanged in April  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the number
of people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims was
essentially unchanged in April at 235,700. The number has
remained relatively stable since September 2011.  Claims increased in  Nova Scotia  (+7.4%), Prince Edward
Island (+7.0%), Saskatchewan (+5.8%) and British Columbia
(+4.5%). They declined 1.3% in Quebec and there was little
change in all other provinces.  Beneficiaries down in nine provinces  The number of beneficiaries decreased in nine provinces in
April. The largest percentage declines occurred in Quebec
(-7.0%), Ontario (-6.7%), Alberta (-6.7%) and Saskatchewan
(-6.4%).  There were also declines in British Columbia (-5.1%) and
Manitoba (-4.4%). The number of people receiving benefits edged
down in Nova Scotia,  New Brunswick  and Newfoundland and Labrador.
There was no change in Prince Edward Island.  Continued year-over-year declines in most large centres  Large centres are those with a population of 10,000 or more.
Monthly EI data by sub-provincial region are not seasonally
adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  Between April 2011 and April 2012, the number of people
receiving regular EI benefits decreased in 137 of the 143 large
centres.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of beneficiaries
declined in all five large centres during the 12-month period.
In  St. John’s , the number fell 21.1% to 3,900, continuing a two-
year-long downward trend.  The two large centres in Prince  Edward Island  had fewer
beneficiaries for the 11th consecutive month. The largest
percentage decline occurred in Charlottetown, where the number
of beneficiaries fell 20.1%. It was the biggest decrease since
the beginning of the downward trend in July 2011.  All five large centres in Nova Scotia had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to April. The largest decline
occurred in Halifax, where the number of people receiving
benefits fell 16.4% to 5,000. This continued a two-year-long
downward trend.  In New Brunswick, five of the six large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12-month period. The largest decline was in
Saint John, where the number fell 12.4% to 2,500. There were
fewer beneficiaries in Fredericton for the second consecutive
month.  Of the 33 large centres in  Quebec , 31 had fewer
beneficiaries between April 2011 and April 2012. The largest
percentage decreases were in Rouyn-Noranda, Rivière-du-Loup and
Sherbrooke. In Montréal, the number of people receiving benefits

in March 2010.  All 41 large centres in Ontario had fewer beneficiaries.

and Windsor. In Toronto, the number of beneficiaries fell 21.6%

benefits decreased in all four large centres in the 12 months to

to 6,000, the 20th consecutive month of year-over-year declines.  There were fewer beneficiaries in seven of the eight large
centres in Saskatchewan, with the largest percentage decline in

1,000, continuing the downward trend that began in the summer of
2010. In Saskatoon, 1,700 people received benefits, down 11.3%,

Squamish, Penticton, Vernon, Kamloops, Kelowna,  Vancouver  and
Victoria. In Vancouver, 22,500 people received benefits in April,
down 21.4% from April 2011. This continued a series of declines
that began almost two years earlier. In Victoria, 2,800 people
received regular benefits, down 20.9%.  Demographic groups  EI data by sex and age are not seasonally adjusted and are
therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  Between April 2011 and April 2012, the number of men
receiving regular benefits fell 16.4% to 366,800, continuing a
series of declines that started in March 2010. The number of
beneficiaries fell 19.0% among men under 25 years of age and
17.0% among those aged 25 to 54. For men aged 55 and over, the
number of people receiving benefits declined 13.1%.  A total of 195,500 women received regular benefits, down
15.0% from 12 months earlier. Among women under 25 years of age,
the number of beneficiaries fell 17.1%, while for those aged 25
to 54, the number fell 15.5%. For women 55 and over, the decline
was 12.4%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance
(EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for March and April are
preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond to those
with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from April 15 to 21. This period coincides
with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people
who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
