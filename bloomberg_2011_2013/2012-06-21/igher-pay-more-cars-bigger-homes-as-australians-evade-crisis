Australians became richer, owned
more cars and lived in larger homes in a five-year period
spanning the world’s worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, according to a Census released today.  The proportion of households earning more than A$3,000
($3,050) a week more than doubled from 2006 to 11 percent,
according to data from the 2011  Census , which showed the
population climbed 8.3 percent to 21.5 million. Households with
three or more cars rose to 17 percent from 15 percent, while
homes with at least four bedrooms increased to 30 percent.  Australia  hasn’t slipped into a recession for two decades,
with growth now powered by the biggest resource boom since the
Gold Rush of the 1850s. The latest bonanza -- led by demand from
 Asia  for  iron ore , coal and natural gas -- is bringing about
A$500 billion of investment, helping keep unemployment at 5.1
percent, versus 5.2 percent in 2006. The jobless rate in the
U.S. is 8.2 percent and in the euro area it’s 11 percent.  “We’re the great story of the world economy,” said Tim Harcourt, a fellow in economics at the Australian School of
Business in Sydney. “We suffer from not realizing how good we
have it compared to the rest of the world.”  Australian  consumer confidence  in June stagnated near the
lowest level this year amid concern about the domestic and
global economic outlooks, according to the  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
and Melbourne Institute survey released last week.  The Census data also showed the number of divorcees
climbed, the percentage of married people fell, and the
proportion of single, male parents rose. The percentage of
respondents who said they held no religion climbed to 22.3
percent of the population, and a smaller share of Australians
did volunteer work.  Mandarin Tongue  Australia’s two-speed economy is divided between resource-
rich regions in the north and west, and states in the south and
east struggling to remain competitive as the local dollar’s
surge hampers the competitiveness of manufacturing and tourism
and drives shoppers online.  China  is Australia’s biggest trading partner, and the
Census reflected the shift in economic ties to Asia. Mandarin
replaced Italian as the most-common language spoken at home
after English. The proportion of the population born in  India 
doubled to 1.4 percent, or 295,362 people, the biggest increase
of the top five responses.  The proportion of people with both parents born overseas
rose to 34 percent from 32 percent in 2006. Individuals with
both parents born in Australia made up 54 percent of
respondents.  Mining Boom  In Western Australia, responsible for 61 percent of the
country’s  mineral and energy exports  last year, the population
surged 14 percent. The median household weekly rent paid in the
state soared 76 percent to A$300.  Nationwide, median  household income  jumped 20 percent to
A$1,234 a week, the data showed. Adjusted for inflation, the
gain over that period was 4.1 percent, a slower so-called real
increase than the 14 percent jump from the 2001 to 2006
censuses, according to Bloomberg calculations using a price
 formula  on the central bank’s website.  The median monthly mortgage payment in 2011 surged to
A$1,800 from A$1,300 in 2006, and the median weekly rent jumped
to A$285 from A$190, the Census showed. That increased the
proportion of households parting with more than 30 percent of
their income on either rent or mortgage payments.  The proportion of people who consider themselves of
Australian ancestry, the most popular answer in the 2006 Census,
was displaced by those choosing English, according to the data.  The number of Australians in their 60s rose to 9.9 percent
of the population in 2011, from 8.6 percent, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
