Heating oil slid to a 17-month low
as manufacturing weakened in  Europe  and China and more Americans
than forecast filed for  jobless claims , indicating that fuel
demand may decline.  Futures sank 2.4 percent as a gauge of euro-region
manufacturing fell to 44.8 from 45.1 in May, London-based Markit
Economics said in an initial estimate. The preliminary reading
of 48.1 for a June Chinese purchasing managers’ index from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit indicated contraction. The  Federal
Reserve  yesterday cut its growth estimates for the  U.S. economy .  “The Federal Reserve failed to be more aggressive and
there’s weakening manufacturing data,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “The market
is well-supplied.”  Heating oil for July delivery fell 6.21 cents to $2.5253 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Jan. 7, 2011. Prices have declined 24 percent
from their year-to-date closing high of $3.3159 on Feb. 24. A
drop of more than 20 percent is the common definition of a  bear
market .  The dollar surged 1.2 percent against the euro at 3:04 p.m.
in  New York , reducing the investment appeal of commodities.  “There’s a significant rally in the dollar, the S&P is
down and there’s economic uncertainty with fears of a global
recession,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Broad Decline  The heating oil decline was part of a broader drop. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index sank 2 percent. Crude oil for
August delivery on the Nymex fell below $80 for the first time
in eight months, sliding 4 percent to $78.20 a barrel. The S&P’s
 GSCI index  of 24 materials retreated 2.6 percent.  “A lot of false hopes and expectations have been chopped
off at the kneecaps,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner
at the Energy Management Institute in New York. “Every single
piece of economic data the last several weeks has been negative
and demand is getting worse. The trend is down.”  Jobless claims in the U.S. declined 2,000 to 387,000 last
week, Labor Department figures showed, higher than the 383,000
 forecast  in a survey by Bloomberg.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s  general economic
index  fell to minus 16.6 in June, the lowest level since August,
from minus 5.8 the previous month. The report covers eastern
Pennsylvania, southern  New Jersey  and  Delaware .  “You’ve got an overall negative situation with the global
economy now and nobody really wants to be buying right now,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
New York. “There’s probably talk of stagflation now in the
U.S.”  Federal Reserve  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at a Washington
press conference yesterday, said policy makers are focusing
“primarily” on the outlook for jobs in deciding whether to
ease further, and more  action would be needed without
“sustained improvement in the labor market.”  July-delivery gasoline slipped 4.01 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.5501 a gallon, the lowest settlement since Dec. 19.
Futures have sunk 5.6 percent this week and are down 25 percent
from their year-to-date high of $3.4166 on March 26.  The premium for July over August gained 1.52 cents to 9.81
cents a gallon, the largest spread between the two contracts
nearest to expiration since May 31.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.5
cents to $3.472 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA. It was the
lowest price since Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
