The U.S. doesn’t wage “offensive”
cyber attacks, the chairman of the House intelligence committee
said today.  Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, disputed
news accounts of U.S.-orchestrated cyber attacks on  Iran’s
nuclear program .  “The  United States  does not use offensive capabilities,”
Rogers said today at a Bloomberg Government conference in
Washington. “We just don’t do it.”  Asked by reporters about published reports that the U.S.
and Israel cooperated on the Stuxnet virus that damaged Iran’s
nuclear centrifuges, Rogers said, “I’m just saying don’t take
all that at face value. I’d be very careful about ascribing
authorship of that software.”  Asked if he was saying broadly that the U.S. doesn’t engage
in offensive cyber operations, Rogers said, “We by policy
haven’t worked out what our policy is in the U.S. about
unilateral, military style cyber attacks much like what was
described has happened in  Estonia  and  Georgia .”  Websites in both countries were the targets of distributed
denial-of-service cyber attacks, meaning they were knocked
offline. The attacks in Estonia occurred in 2007 and those in
Georgia happened in 2008 during a conflict with Russia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
