The cost of insuring Australian
corporate bonds from default declined, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 1 basis point to 181
basis points as of 10:47 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. The gauge is set for its lowest close since May
11, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 174.5 basis points
as of 8:31 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The index has fallen 24 basis points this month,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index was also little changed at
177 basis points as of 9:49 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
