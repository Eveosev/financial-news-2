Spanish 10-year bonds advanced as
the nation prepared to sell as much as 2 billion euros ($2.5
billion) of notes maturing in 2014, 2015 and 2017.  The  10-year rate  fell 11 basis points to 6.64 percent at
8:29 a.m. London time.  Similar-maturity Italian debt also rose, with the yield
dropping six basis points to 5.71 percent.  Borrowing costs for Spanish one-year bills surged to more
than 5 percent at a sale two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
