Yakult Honsha Co. (2267) , a Japanese
fermented-milk drink maker, climbed the most in two months in
 Tokyo  trading after saying it will continue talks with  Danone (BN) ,
which has said it wants to increase its stake.  Yakult  gained  3.6 percent, the biggest surge since April
23, to 3,050 yen at 10:28 a.m. in Tokyo. The shares had their
biggest gain in 12 years on April 23, the first trading day
after a Nikkei newspaper report on Danone’s interest in raising
its stake.  The maker of yogurt-based drinks will continue discussions
with Paris-based Danone, which owns a 20 percent stake,
President Takashige Negishi told shareholders yesterday at the
annual meeting in Tokyo. Danone would make a tender offer to
raise its stake to 35 percent should talks to increase its stake
to 28 percent fail after an agreement to limit its holding to 20
percent expired in May, according to the Nikkei report.  “There is speculation among investors that Danone might
proceed to a takeover bid,” said  Hiroshi Saji , an analyst at
Mizuho Securities Co. “The possibility of a takeover bid is not
very high because buying a Japanese representative company by
unfriendly take-over may not win Japanese consumers’ support.”  Danone spokeswoman  Charlotte  Pasternak couldn’t be reached
via e-mail out of office hours.  Yakult’s probiotic and fermented milk drinks are similar to
offerings from Danone, the world’s largest yogurt maker.  The Japanese drinks maker has said it opposes an increase
in Danone’s stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
