Tampa Bay Rays relief pitcher Joel Peralta was suspended eight games by  Major League Baseball  after
being ejected from a game against the  Washington Nationals  three
nights ago for having pine tar on his glove.  Peralta, who played for the Nationals in 2010, was set to
replace starter  David Price  and was throwing warmup pitches
before the bottom of the eighth inning when Washington manager
 Davey Johnson  asked umpire crew chief Tim Tschida to inspect
Peralta’s glove.  “It was a significant amount of pine tar,” Tschida told
reporters after the game.  Peralta has appealed, delaying the start of the suspension.  Batters use pine tar to keep the bat from slipping out of
their hands, but it’s not allowed for use by pitchers. MLB rules
state that pitchers may not apply a foreign substance of any
kind to the ball or have a foreign substance in their
possession.  After the game, which the Rays won 5-4, Tampa Bay manager
Joe Maddon told reporters that pitchers’ use of pine tar is a
common practice and that Johnson’s decision to challenge
Peralta, possibly based on knowledge gained during the time the
pitcher spent with the Nationals, was “real cowardly.”  “You’re going to see brand new gloves throughout the major
leagues starting tomorrow,” Maddon said.  Peralta, 36, is 0-2 this season with a 3.81 earned run
average in 35 appearances. He tipped his hat toward the
Nationals’ dugout while walking off the field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
