Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  will tighten mortgage-length rules for the third-time
as the Group of Seven country with the soundest government
finances tries to avert a household debt crisis, a government
official said.  Flaherty will shorten the maximum amortization period on
mortgages the government insures to 25 years from 30 years, the
person said, speaking on condition they not be identified
because the decision hasnâ€™t been made public. The changes were
first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in a report
that was confirmed by the government official.  Flaherty has already reduced the amortization limits twice
since 2008, cutting them from 40 years amid concern historically
low borrowing costs are fueling a housing bubble and pushing
 household debt  to record highs. The shorter-term mortgages
increase monthly payments for home owners, prompting people to
take on less debt to finance a house.  To contact the reporter on this story:
