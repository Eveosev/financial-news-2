Norbert Barthle, budget spokesman
for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats in
parliament, said it was conceivable to change the maturities or
interest rates on Greece’s loans,  Passauer Neue Presse  reported
today, citing an interview.  Barthle’s view contradicts comments by the Christian
Democratic Union’s floor leader,  Volker Kauder , who has refused
to extend maturities on Greek debt, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
