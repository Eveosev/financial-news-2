Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
said the formation of his coalition government today represents
a new start for  Greece  and that its goal is to get the country
out of its economic crisis.  “Today is a new day for the land,” Samaras said at the
start of his government’s first cabinet meeting, in comments
carried live on state-run NET TV. The New Democracy, Pasok and
Democratic Left political parties, which comprise his coalition
“showed their responsibility towards the people” by forming
the government, he said.  Members of his government will have their salaries reduced
by 30 percent and have their use of ministerial cars reduced to
a minimum, Samaras said. “The best way for someone to govern is
to set an example,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
