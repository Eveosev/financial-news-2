The world is safer today than it was
four years ago, two defense analysts said today at a Bloomberg
Government conference in Washington.  “The world’s plenty dangerous, but people who want to make
the Cold War sound like the good old days are forgetting their
history,” said  Michael O’Hanlon , an analyst at the  Brookings
Institution . “On balance, the world of 2012 is a much safer
place to live than the world in 1962 or 1972 or probably even
1982.”  Christopher Preble, a defense analyst at the Cato
Institute, said military spending today is about equal to the
level in the Reagan-era buildup of the 1980’s, when adjusted for
inflation.  “We’re in a much stronger position today than we were 40
or 50 years ago,” Preble said.  Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst at the  American
Enterprise Institute  in Washington, disputed that assessment,
citing testimony from military service chiefs who have warned
about growing dangers in an era of cyber warfare and terrorism.  A panel with the analysts opened the day-long Bloomberg
Government conference at the Newseum in  Washington  designed to
assess national-security risks and military spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
