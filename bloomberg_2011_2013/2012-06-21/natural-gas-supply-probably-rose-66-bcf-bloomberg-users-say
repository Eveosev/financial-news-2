The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 2.2 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
66 billion cubic feet in the week ended June 15 to 3.01 trillion
cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for July delivery rose 2.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $2.542 per million British thermal units on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 10:24 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
