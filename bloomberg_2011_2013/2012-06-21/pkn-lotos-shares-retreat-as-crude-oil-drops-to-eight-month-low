PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) ,
Poland’s top refiners, fell as oil dropped to the lowest price
in eight months after U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly increased and
a report signaled China’s manufacturing will shrink this month.  Orlen retreated 0.6 percent to 36.71 zloty at 2:58 p.m. in
Warsaw, falling for the first time in three days, and Lotos
declined 2.2 percent to 27.54 zloty, sliding for a second day.  Oil tumbled below $80 a barrel for the first time in eight
months in New York after Federal Reserve policy makers lowered
the outlook for U.S. economic growth and employment, while a
preliminary reading of Chinese manufacturing by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit Economics pointed to a contraction for an eighth
month.  China  is the second-biggest user of oil after the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
