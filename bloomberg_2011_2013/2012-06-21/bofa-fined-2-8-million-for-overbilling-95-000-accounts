Bank of America Corp.’s  Merrill
Lynch wealth-management unit was fined $2.8 million by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for overbilling
customers by $32.2 million over an eight-year period.  Merrill Lynch charged the fees to about 95,000 accounts
between April 2003 and December 2011, FINRA said in a statement
today. New York-based Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank
of America in 2009, lacked an adequate supervisory system to
ensure that customers were billed in accordance with their
contracts and disclosure documents, the regulator said.  “Investors must be able to trust that the fees charged by
their securities firm are, in fact, correct,” Brad Bennett,
FINRA’s chief of enforcement, said in the statement. “When this
is not the case, investor confidence is threatened.”  Bill Halldin , a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America, said the charges were largely “the
result of improper coding of accounts,” which the firm
discovered on its own.  “We have improved our systems to address these issues and
we have reimbursed affected clients,” he said in a telephone
interview.  FINRA also  faulted  Merrill Lynch for failing over a four-
year period to send 10.6 million trade confirmations to 230,000
customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
