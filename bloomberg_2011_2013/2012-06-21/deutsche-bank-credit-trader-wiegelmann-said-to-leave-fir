Bjoern Wiegelmann, a director of
credit trading at  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in London, has left after
five years at the firm, according to two people with knowledge
of the matter.  Wiegelmann will start at another investment bank in London
in October after the end of his so-called gardening leave, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private.  Frank Hartmann, a spokesman for the Frankfurt-based bank
declined to comment. Wiegelmann, who joined Germany’s largest
bank in 2007, didn’t return calls to his mobile phone.  Deutsche Bank’s revenue from debt trading in the first
quarter dropped 8.1 percent to 3.4 billion euros ($4.3 billion)
from a year earlier, according to filings on April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
