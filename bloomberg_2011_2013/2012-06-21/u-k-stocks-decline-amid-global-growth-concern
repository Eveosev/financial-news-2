U.K. stocks  dropped by the most in
almost three weeks, led by a selloff in mining companies, as
manufacturing reports in Europe and China added to concern that
global economic growth is weakening.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  both tumbled
more 4.5 percent as base metals dropped in London. Banks
declined after Moody’s Investors Service was said to have told
lenders it may announce credit-rating downgrades. Invensys Plc
plunged 14 percent after the company said it’s no longer in
takeover talks with third parties.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  fell 1 percent to 5,566.36 in London,
trimming its gain over the last five days to 1.8 percent. The
gauge has lost 6.7 percent from its 2012 high amid concern the
euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis is derailing global growth.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index slid 1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 0.7 percent.  “Investors have moved to lock in their profits after some
good equity gains earlier this week,” said Joshua Raymond,
chief market strategist at  City Index . “Chinese manufacturing
data has showed yet another contraction in activity. This has
correlated with weakening demand for mining stocks.”  Manufacturing in the euro-area contracted at the fastest
pace in three years in June, while China’s factory output is
seen shrinking for an eighth month, according to purchasing
managers’ indexes from  Markit Economics  and  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   The U.S. Federal Reserve also cut its growth forecast for
the world’s largest economy after the close of European trading
yesterday. The central bank now predicts growth of 1.9 percent
to 2.4 percent this year, lower than an April forecast of 2.4
percent to 2.9 percent.  Commodity Shares  A gauge of  U.K. mining companies  tumbled 3.5 percent with
copper, the biggest decline in almost a month. Anglo American
fell 5.2 percent to 2,101 pence, Vedanta slid 4.9 percent to 930
pence and  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  fell 3.2 percent to 322.65
pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  fell 1.7 percent to 202.3 pence,  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  slid 1.7 percent to 243.30 pence and HSBC
Holdings Plc retreated 1.1 percent to 559.20 pence.  Moody’s has told banks it may today announce downgrades of
the credit ratings of as many as 17 lenders and securities firms
with global capital markets operations, according to two people
with knowledge of the plans. The announcement may come after the
close of trading in New York.  The company said in February it may lower the ratings of
firms including UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays as
part of a review of how Europe’s sovereign debt crisis was
hurting more than 100 lenders. Any downgrades could raise
borrowing costs and force banks to increase collateral.  Invensys (ISYS)  plunged 14 percent to 220 pence, paring some of
yesterday’s 27 percent advance, after the British maker of rail
signaling and industrial automation systems said it’s reviewing
options following unsuccessful takeover talks with suitors
including Emerson Electric Co.  Ashtead Group Plc (AHT)  rose 1.8 percent to 254.8 pence after the
equipment-rental company said profits in the current year may
exceed previous expectations. Ashtead is making gains in the
U.S. where a weak construction market is prompting customers to
switch to leasing from purchase of equipment.  The company today reported full-year net income of 88.5
million pounds ($138.9 million), up from 900,000 pounds a year
earlier.  Dixons Retail Plc (DXNS)  gained 7.4 percent to 17.19 pence after
the U.K.’s largest consumer electronics retailer said it had had
a “good start” to this fiscal year as earnings topped
analysts’ estimates.  Underlying pretax profit fell 17 percent to 70.8 million
pounds ($111 million) in the 12 months through April 28. That
compares with the median estimate of 68 million pounds. The
company in May forecast profit to be at the top end of estimates
of 65 million pounds to 70 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
