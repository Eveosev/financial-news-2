European stock futures fell as the
Federal Reserve cut its growth forecast for the U.S. economy and
a survey showed China’s manufacturing may shrink for an eighth
month. U.S. index futures and Asian shares dropped.  Mining companies may decline with commodity prices.  Sanofi (SAN) 
SA may be active after it failed to win a U.S. Food and Drug
Administration advisory panel’s backing for a blood-clot
treatment.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  may slip after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut its recommendation for the company’s shares.  TNT
Express NV (TNTE)  might move as United Parcel Service Inc. offered 9.50
euros a share to buy the Dutch express-delivery company.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in September
dropped 0.4 percent to 2,191 at 7:06 a.m. in London, while FTSE
100 Index futures lost 0.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
has declined 8.3 percent from its high on March 16 on concern
that Greece will have to leave the euro currency union. Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.4 percent, while the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index decreased 0.6 percent.  “European markets are set to open on the back foot as they
have their first chance to react to the Fed announcement and
another soft flash Chinese manufacturing PMI print,” said
Cameron Peacock, a market analyst at IG Markets in  Melbourne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
