California regulators will open an
investigation into  Edison International (EIX) ’s San Onofre nuclear
power plant this year.  The California Public Utilities Commission wants more
clarity from federal nuclear regulators before starting its
probe, Michael Peevey, president of the state agency, said at a
meeting in  San Francisco  today.  The two reactors at San Onofre have been shut since January
after inspections of a small leak revealed unusual wear on tubes
that carry radioactive water. Staff of the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said this week that faulty computer
analysis and manufacturing changes may have caused exessive wear
on the plant’s steam generators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
