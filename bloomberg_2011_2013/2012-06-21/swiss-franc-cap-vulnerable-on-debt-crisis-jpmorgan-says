The  Swiss National Bank ’s ceiling on
the franc versus the euro is vulnerable because the sovereign
debt crisis may deepen, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.
strategists.  The SNB’s foreign-exchange reserves surged to 70 percent of
 Switzerland ’s gross domestic product in May, more than the 56
percent level when the central bank abandoned its previous
currency-intervention policy in May 2010, analysts led by
Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients today. They
recommended protecting against euro weakness via options.  “The merits of accruing so much exposure to the euro will
look increasingly suspect if the sovereign crisis intensifies
and euro-dollar collapses in a high-volatility fashion, thus
anchoring Swiss monetary policy to an imploding asset,” the
analysts said.  The Swiss currency was little changed at 1.2011 per euro at
4:15 p.m. London time. The SNB has vowed to resolutely defend
the 1.20 francs-per-euro cap it established in September after
the euro-area debt crisis pushed the haven currency to a record
high of 1.008 per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
