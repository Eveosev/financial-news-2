Natural gas rose in  New York  after
falling yesterday on forecasts that showed the weather will cool
following this weekâ€™s heat wave in the eastern U.S.  Futures for July delivery rose as much as 1.3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.53 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:12 a.m. Tokyo time. The contract
dropped 1.1 percent yesterday as MDA EarthSat Weather in
Gaithersburg, Maryland, said above-normal temperatures in the
Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest over the next week will be
replaced by normal or below-average temperatures for the rest of
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
