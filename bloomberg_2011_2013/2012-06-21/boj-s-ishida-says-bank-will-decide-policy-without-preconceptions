The  Bank of Japan (8301)  has “absolutely
no preconceptions” about what action it will take at its next
policy meeting, board member Koji Ishida said amid speculation
that the central bank will add stimulus in July.  Even if the bank reduced the inflation forecast, this may
not be enough to prompt extra easing if price gains had
momentum, Ishida said in response to a question about monetary
easing at a news conference today in Kagoshima, southern  Japan .
At the meeting in July the bank will review the inflation
forecast of 0.7 percent for fiscal 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
