Taiwan ’s government bonds were
little changed before the central bank meets today, with
analysts predicting policy makers will leave borrowing costs
unchanged. The currency weakened.  The  benchmark  discount rate will stay at 1.875 percent, all
15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted. Taiwan is
also due to sell NT$40 billion ($1.3 billion) of 10-year notes
tomorrow, when it’s set to announce the auction schedule for the
third quarter.  “Traders are waiting for the central bank’s call on
rates,” said  James Wang , a debt trader at Yuanta Securities Co.
in Taipei. “We’re in a wait-and-see mode” before the bond sale
and the pipeline announcement, he said.  The yield on the 1.25 percent securities maturing in March
2022 was at 1.188 percent at the close in Taipei, compared with
1.192 percent yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwan plans to sell fewer bonds in 2013 than this year,
Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford said yesterday, declining to
give an estimate. Wang said issuance may be similar to 2012
because of redemptions in 2013.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.902 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, dropped 25 basis points to 4.65 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.511
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
