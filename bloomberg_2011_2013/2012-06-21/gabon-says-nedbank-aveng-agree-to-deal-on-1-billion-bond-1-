Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  and construction
company  Aveng Ltd. (AEG)  have agreed to a Gabon government proposal to
settle a legal dispute that delayed coupon payments on $1
billion of Eurobonds, said Sylvain Allogho, an adviser to the
economy minister.  “Gabon will settle the actual dispute with Aveng and
Nedbank as soon as possible about the bond issued in 2007,”
Allogho said today by phone from Libreville, the capital.  Calls to the office and mobile phone for Brian Kennedy, the
managing executive of Nedbank Capital, went unanswered and he
didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg’s message. Aveng’s
finance director, Kobus Verster, didn’t immediately return
Bloomberg’s phone request to his office for comment.  The oil-producing West African nation said June 20 that it
would make a June coupon payment on the Eurobonds “as soon as
possible” after a court order froze funds intended for note-
holders.  To contact the reporters on this story:
