Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTELEKOM) , the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , headed for the highest close in six
weeks after the European Union queried the countryâ€™s
telecommunications tax.  The shares rose 1.8 percent to 460 forint by 1:24 p.m. in
Budapest, the strongest level on a closing basis since May 11.
The stock fell to a record low of 413 forint on May 21 after the
government placed a levy on telephone calls.  The European Commission has given Hungary two months to
provide further information on the tax, commission spokeswoman
Emer Traynor told reporters in Brussels today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
