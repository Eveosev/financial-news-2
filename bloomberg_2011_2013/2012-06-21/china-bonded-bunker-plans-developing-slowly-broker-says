Plans to issue more licenses to
supply tax-exempt ship fuel in  China  are developing slowly,
according to the Shanghai Shipbrokers Association, which is
involved in drafting the new regulations.  “The central government is still studying the plan and
formulating the rules and we don’t expect a result in the short
term,” Liu Xunliang, secretary-general of the association, said
at a conference in  Hong Kong  today.  China’s Ministry of Commerce is developing a plan to issue
more licenses for bonded bunker fuel, which is exempt from
 import taxes  because it is sold to vessels traveling overseas.
The ministry has received applications from five companies, Zhou
Yiqing, the manager of the bunker department at Sinopec Fuel Oil
Sales Co., a unit of  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the
nation’s biggest refiner, said in October.  The five companies that applied for licenses include state-
owned China National Aviation Fuel Group Corp., the country’s
biggest jet-fuel distributor, China Arts Huahai Import & Export
Corp., and Shanghai Fuel Co., Zhou said then. Five Chinese
companies are currently licensed to sell bonded bunker fuel, he
said.  The new applicants may not be ready to start operations
because of a lack of experience and expertise in global bunker
markets, according to Liu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
