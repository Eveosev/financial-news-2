Overseas operations of  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and other U.S. banks may be allowed to comply with
Dodd-Frank Act rules on a timetable similar to one facing their
foreign-based rivals, according to two people with knowledge of
guidance a regulator is poised to propose tomorrow.  The timetable under consideration by the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission would drop earlier plans to give
overseas banks more time to comply with some regulations than
U.S. banks that have branches and subsidiaries around the world,
the people said on condition of anonymity because the guidance
hasn’t yet been proposed.  The compliance schedule was the subject of negotiations
today before the agency’s five commissioners meet in Washington
to vote to release the proposal for public comment. The guidance
could still change before the meeting.  Steve Adamske , a CFTC spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to requests for comment outside of normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
