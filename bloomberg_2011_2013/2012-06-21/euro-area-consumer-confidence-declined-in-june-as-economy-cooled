Euro-area  consumer confidence 
declined in June, adding to signs the currency blocâ€™s economic
slump deepened in the current quarter.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
fell to minus 19.6 from minus 19.3 in May, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today.
Economists had forecast a drop to minus 20, the median of 28
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey  showed.  The commission is scheduled to publish the wider indicator
of euro-region economic confidence on June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
