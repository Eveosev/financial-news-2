The U.S. approved a 350-megawatt
solar farm in Nevada, the first utility-scale project on
American Indian tribal lands.  Construction is scheduled to begin this year on the
reservation of the Moapa Band of Paiute Indians in  Clark County ,
Nevada, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Las Vegas,
Interior Secretary  Ken Salazar  said today on a conference call
with reporters.  The tribe will receive lease income from the power plant
and a tribally owned gas station and casino complex will be
connected to the  power grid . There are more than 250 American
Indian reservations suitable for renewable-energy projects that
may provide similar economic benefits, Salazar said.  “We know there is great potential for tribes when it comes
to renewable energy, to generate investment, new jobs and new
sources of revenues,” he said. “We do not want Indian country
to be left behind as we move forward with the new-energy
frontier.”  The project will be built in three phases of about 100
megawatts to 150 megawatts by K Road Moapa Solar LLC, according
to a  statement  today. When complete, the facility will  power
 about 100,000 homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
