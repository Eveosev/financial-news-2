China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index to the lowest level in three months, after a
report showed  China ’s manufacturing may shrink for an eighth
month in June and the U.S. cut its economic growth estimates.  Jiangxi Copper Co. and China Shenhua Energy Co. the biggest
copper and coal producers, declined more than 2 percent on
concern demand for commodities will slow.  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. paced a retreat for lenders after
the 21st Century Business Herald said the four biggest banks saw
net deposits decline by a combined 460 billion yuan ($72
billion) in the first two weeks of this month.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 32 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,260.88 at the close, the lowest since March 29.
The measure posted a 2 percent drop in the holiday-shortened
week as financial markets are closed tomorrow. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
slid 1.6 percent to 2,512.19. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) ,
the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
fell 0.9 percent in  New York .  “Investors have accepted the fact that the economy is
going to be bad and stimulus measures will be slow,” said Chen
Liqiu, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co. in  Shanghai .
“There’s little impetus to enter the market so stocks will be
dragged down in the near term.”  Concerns that a growth slowdown is deepening and  Greece 
will leave the euro area have pushed the Shanghai index down 8.1
percent from this year’s high set on March 2. It’s still up 2.8
percent in 2012 after the central bank reduced borrowing costs
this month and lowered lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios three
times since November.  China’s manufacturing may contract in June, matching the
streak during the global financial crisis in a signal the
government’s stimulus has yet to reverse the economy’s slowdown.  U.S. Outlook  The 48.1 preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’
index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today
compares with a final 48.4 for May. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. If confirmed on July 2, it would equal the run of
below-50 readings from August 2008 to March 2009.  “Growth is going to be relatively disappointing this
year,”  Howard Wang , the Hong Kong-based head of JPMorgan Asset
Management’s Greater China team, said at a conference in  Hong
Kong  today. “There’s quite a bit of firepower on the monetary
side should the government use it. We’re going to assume though
that they’re going to be incremental as opposed to flood the
system with liquidity.”  A gauge of  energy producers  in the CSI 300 slid 2.8
percent, the most among 10 industry groups. The materials
measure lost 1.8 percent. Shenhua Energy fell 2.3 percent to
23.38  yuan . PetroChina Co., the biggest energy producer, slumped
1.5 percent to 9.12 yuan. Jiangxi Copper declined 3 percent to
24.48 yuan.  U.S. Concern  The U.S. central bank cut its estimates for growth and said
it sees little progress on unemployment during the rest of the
year. The  Federal Reserve  lowered its estimate for 2012 gross
domestic product growth to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, from 2.4
percent to 2.9 percent in April.  The Fed will expand its Operation Twist program to replace
short-term bonds with longer-term debt by $267 billion through
the end of 2012. That “should put downward pressure on longer-
term interest rates and help to make broader financial
conditions more accommodative,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said.  Chinese banks’ borrowing costs rose for a third week, the
longest stretch in 2012, as a funding squeeze fanned speculation
policy makers will relax lenders’ reserve requirements. Shibor,
for 1-month yuan loans, climbed 51 basis points in June to 3.48
percent, after 5 months of declines caused by monetary easing.  QFII Reform  Industrial Bank Co. retreated 1.5 percent to 12.77 yuan.
China Merchants Bank Co. declined 1.2 percent to 10.90 yuan.
ICBC, the biggest lender, slid 0.8 percent to 3.91 yuan. The
along with Bank of China Ltd. and Agricultural Bank of China
Ltd. saw net deposits drop by a combined 460 billion yuan in the
first two weeks of June, the 21st Century Business Herald
reported, citing an unidentified lender.  The government will cut the minimum requirement on assets
under management to $500 million from $5 billion for companies
seeking a license under the Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investor program, the China Securities Regulatory Commission
said in a statement on its website yesterday. The regulator also
said it will allow them to invest in the country’s interbank
bond market.  QFII reform is “unambiguously good for the Chinese market,
for those Chinese companies seeking to finance themselves in the
equity market in China,” Bill Maldonado, chief investment
officer for Asia Pacific at HSBC Global Asset Management, said
at a conference in Hong Kong today.  The iShares FTSE  China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest U.S.-
listed China exchange-traded fund, lost 0.3 percent to $33.94
yesterdayb, snapping a six-day rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
