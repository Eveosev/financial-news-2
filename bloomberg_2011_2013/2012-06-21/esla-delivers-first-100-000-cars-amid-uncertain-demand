Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA)  survived a cash
crisis in 2008 and tomorrow delivers its first electric car
designed and built solely in-house. Co-founder Elon Musk will
soon learn if there’s enough Model S demand for Tesla to profit.  The first 10 “Signature” performance versions are to be
picked up by their owners at Tesla’s Fremont, California,
factory. They’re priced at $95,400 to  $105,400  and able to go
265 miles (426 kilometers) per charge. More than 10,000 people
have made $5,000 deposits to reserve one, Musk said on June 6.  “Then what?” said  Dave Sullivan , an analyst for industry
researcher AutoPacific Inc. “Now everybody that wanted one has
got one, where do they find the next 10,000?”  Tesla is counting on the car to generate the company’s
first profit. It can be “cash-flow positive” in 2013 with
about 8,000 Model S sales, Chief Executive Officer Musk told
shareholders June 6 in  Mountain View ,  California . Tesla plans to
deliver at least 5,300 units, including a $57,400 base version,
this year and 20,000 in 2013, Musk said.  “In the end, this isn’t about Tesla or Model S; it’s about
battery-electric vehicles themselves,” said  Eric Noble ,
president of the Car Lab, an industry consultant in Orange,
California. While “Model S is beautiful,” he said, “proof of
the very limited potential of battery electrics already exists
in the market itself.”  Analysts Optimistic  Equity analysts are generally optimistic that Musk can meet
his targets. Of 17 analysts covering the shares tracked by
Bloomberg, 10 recommend investors buy Tesla and four say the
shares should be held. Three recommend selling the stock.  “We continue to view the shares favorably ahead of what we
consider is a multiyear product cycle, and thus expect an
improved cadence of news flow emerging in the coming weeks to
serve as a positive catalyst for the company,” Barclays
analysts Amir Rozwadowski and  Brian Johnson  said in a June 18
report on Tesla.  Tesla slid 4.7 percent to $32.19 at the close in  New York .
The shares have advanced 13 percent this year and 89 percent
since its June 2010 initial public offering.  The electric-car maker plans additional expansion. It wants
to sell 35,000 total units of the Model S and Model X electric
sport-utility vehicle in 2014, Musk said this month. By 2015,
the carmaker named for inventor  Nikola Tesla  plans to increase
sales further by adding a lower-priced, mass-market battery car.  From 2008 until this year,  Palo Alto , California-based
Tesla sold about 2,500 of the $109,000 Roadster, a rechargeable
sports car made under contract with U.K.-based Group Lotus Plc,
the unprofitable automaker owned by  DRB-Hicom Bhd. (DRB)   Absolute Confidence  “Our factory in Fremont has a capacity somewhere on the
order of a half-million vehicles a year, so we have lot of
growth, a lot of potential to use that asset,” Musk said this
month. “I absolutely feel confident we’ll achieve 20,000 unit
sales next year, in excess of that,” Musk told a shareholder at
the meeting who raised concerns about the volume goal.  U.S. demand for electric-drive cars has so far been less
than automakers anticipated.  General Motors Co. (GM)  sold 7,671
 Chevrolet Volt  plug-in hybrids in the U.S. last year, while
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  delivered 9,674 Leafs, an electric-car record.
Each automaker aimed to sell more than 10,000 of their models.  While Volt sales are picking up this year, with 7,057 sold
through May, that’s well short of CEO Dan Akerson’s target of
45,000.  The Volt and Toyota’s Prius plug-in hybrid this year are
outpacing the Leaf’s 2,613 sales in the U.S., which Nissan has
attributed to distribution problems. Leaf sales should soar to
20,000 in the fiscal year ending March 2013 when the Smyrna,
Tennessee, plant begins building it late this year, Nissan
Americas Vice Chairman Bill Krueger said in a June 16 interview.  More Electrics  At least a dozen more plug-in models, including  Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. (7211) ’s “i” minicar and an electric Focus compact from
 Ford Motor Co. (F) , are entering the market to meet California
regulations requiring sale of such vehicles as well as demand
from some drivers for alternatives to gasoline-fueled cars.  AutoPacific estimates Tesla may sell only 4,500 Model S
cars next year and 5,500 in 2014, said Sullivan, the analyst.  Tesla’s volume targets “are slightly unreasonable,” said
Michael Omotoso, an analyst at LMC Automotive in Troy,  Michigan .  LMC estimates that while total demand for hybrid and
rechargeable vehicles may reach about 7.25 percent of vehicle
sales in the U.S. by 2017, only 0.5 percent will be battery-only
vehicles, Omotoso said.  “Improvements in conventional gasoline-engine technology
are likely to make hybrid and electric vehicles less appealing
for many people because of the much higher cost,” he said.  Topping Tucker  In delivering a car designed and built entirely in-house,
Musk will achieve something that has eluded most American
entrepreneurs since  Henry Ford . Notable failures include Preston
Tucker’s inability to build Tucker Corp.’s Tucker sedan in 1948
and John DeLorean’s dream of selling gull-winged DMC-12 sports
cars that ended with DeLorean Motor Co.’s 1982 bankruptcy.  “It’s impressive that Tesla has made it into production,”
Sullivan said. “They have a very unique business design, and
they have partnered up with major companies that want that
exposure of doing something different, being on the leading edge
of battery propulsion.”  Tesla investors include Toyota,  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Panasonic
Corp. (6752)  A contract to supply battery packs and motors to Daimler
that began in 2009 helped Tesla survive dwindling funds and
rising costs in 2008 that threatened to put it out of business.
In 2010, Toyota invested $50 million in Tesla and is buying
motors and battery packs from it for use in its electric RAV4
sport-utility vehicle that goes on sale this year.  U.S. Loans  The company won low-cost federal loans in 2009 worth $465
million to fund a U.S. plant to make Model S and to engineer it
and future electric cars. Tesla begins repaying the loans, with
interest rates of 0.9 percent to 3.4 percent, late this year.  The Model S rollout will have to be perfect at the start,
Sullivan said. The model is aimed at wealthy drivers who are
passionate about electric cars and own a number of additional
vehicles, he said.  “They have 10,000 orders, but that’s pending production
snafus,” Sullivan said. “A bigger automaker has more resources
to deal with that type of problem. I’m cautiously optimistic
they can have a flawless launch.”  Many Americans are turned off by the high price and limited
range of electric cars.  “An electric vehicle simply isn’t an acceptable substitute
for the majority of drivers,” the Car Lab’s Noble said. “In
the end, there’s only so many people that want these vehicles,
and when that pool is depleted, there’s not going to be more of
them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
