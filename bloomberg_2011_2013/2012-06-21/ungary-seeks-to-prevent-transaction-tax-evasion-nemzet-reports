Hungary may pass legislation “any
time” to stop banks from evading a planned transaction tax by
moving transactions abroad,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing Adam
Balog, deputy state secretary at the  Economy Ministry .  Details of the levy, to be introduced from 2013, may be
altered and changes may include a transaction amount ceiling or
different tax rates depending on the size of transactions, while
some transactions may be exempt, Balog said, according to
Nemzet.  Hungary is seeking 280 billion forint ($1.2 billion) in
 budget  revenue from the tax in 2013 and 320 billion in 2014,
Balog told the Budapest-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
