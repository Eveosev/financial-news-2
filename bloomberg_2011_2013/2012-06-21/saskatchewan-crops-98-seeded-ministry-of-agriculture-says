Saskatchewan crops were 98 percent
seeded as of June 18, the Ministry of Agriculture said in a
report today.  Thatâ€™s ahead of the 82 percent seeded a year earlier and a
five-year average of 91 percent, the ministry said. As much as 4
inches (10 centimeters) of rain fell last week, slowing crop
development in some crop-growing areas, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
