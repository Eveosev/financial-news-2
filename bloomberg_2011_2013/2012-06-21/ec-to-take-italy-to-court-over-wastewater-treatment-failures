The European Commission said today
that it’s taking  Italy  to court for failing to ensure that
wastewater from some areas with more than 10,000 residents
that’s discharged into environmentally sensitive sites is
properly treated.  European Union legislation since 1998 over wastewater
treatment has sought to minimize risks to humans, inland waters
and the marine environment, the EC said in a news release.
Italy, it said, has lagged behind in implementing the
legislation.  According to the EC, “significant shortcomings that remain
have led the Commission, on the recommendation of Environment
Commissioner Janez Potocnik, to refer the case to the EU Court
of Justice.” About 143 towns in Italy were still not connected
to a “suitable sewage system,” lacked secondary treatment
facilities or had insufficient capacity, it said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
