Auto sales may have less room to
grow because Americans are increasingly willing to settle for
owning one car or truck, according to Itay Michaeli, a Citigroup
Inc. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the average number of
vehicles for every U.S. driver since 1960, according to data
that Citigroup compiled from the  Federal Highway Administration 
and Ward’s Automotive Reports. Michaeli included a similar chart
in a report two days ago.  Last year’s average was little changed at 1.14, according
to his estimate. The indicator of what he called auto density
had fallen for three straight years after rising to a record
1.18 in 2007.  “Density may be the single most important factor in this
sales cycle,” Michaeli wrote. He estimated that the figure may
drop 2.9 percent during the next two years, based on the results
of a Citigroup survey of about 2,200 Americans this month. The
projected decline widened from 1.6 percent in March, when an
earlier poll was done.  The latest survey signaled a weakening of demand for cars
and light trucks, according to the New York-based analyst. He
cut his sales estimate for this year by 200,000 vehicles, to
14.1 million, and his projection for next year by 500,000, to
14.5 million.  “Demand remains uniquely depressed” for this stage of an
economic recovery, Michaeli wrote. Auto sales may retreat to an
annual rate of 13 million if density slips to 1990s levels, the
report said. The average fell as low as 1.04 during that decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
