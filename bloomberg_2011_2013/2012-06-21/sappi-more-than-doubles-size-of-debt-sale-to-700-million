Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest
producer of glossy paper, more than doubled the size of a bond
offering and said it will use the funds to refinance more
expensive debt.  The debt sale by Sappi’s PE Paper Escrow GmbH unit was
increased to $700 million from $300 million, with the new bonds
consisting of $400 million notes due in 2017 with a coupon of
7.75 percent a year and $300 million of debt due 2019 with an
annual coupon of 8.375 percent, Johannesburg-based company said
in a statement today.  Sappi will buy back as much as $700 million of outstanding
dollar-denominated 12 percent senior-secured debt maturing in
2014 and euro-denominated 11.75 percent bonds due the same year,
it said.  “The pricing of this upsized bond offering represents a
further step in the execution of Sappi’s strategy, dealing with
its high-cost 2014 bonds and improving its debt maturity
profile,” said Chief Executive Officer Ralph Boettger. The
transaction will cut Sappi’s yearly cash-finance charges by
about $27 million, he said.  Sappi has total  debt  of $1.97 billion, including 350
million euro ($444 million) in bonds and $300 million in notes
due in August 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company will consider resuming dividend payments once net debt
has dropped below $2 billion, Boettger said on Feb 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
