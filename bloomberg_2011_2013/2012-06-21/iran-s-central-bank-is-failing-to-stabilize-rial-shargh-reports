Iran ’s central bank needs a long-
term policy to stabilize the domestic foreign-currency market,
 Shargh  reported, citing Omid Karimian, a member of the
parliament’s economic committee.  Recent fluctuations in the value of the dollar to Iran’s
rial “are a testimony to the lack of solidity of our economy,”
Karimian said, according to the Tehran-based newspaper.
Variations show the “failure” of the central bank’s policy, he
said, adding that the bank’s role mustn’t be only to inject
dollars into the economy.  The dollar was sold for 18,300 rials on the open market
yesterday, up 270 rials from the day before, according to the
report. Though the central bank fixed the official  exchange rate 
at 12,260 rials per dollar in an effort to stabilize the
national currency, it hasn’t been able to enforce it as the sole
rate or manage the gap between the official and the open-market
rates, Shargh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
