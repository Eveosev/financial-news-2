Cabot Corp. (CBT)  agreed to buy Norit NV,
the largest producer of activated carbon, for $1.1 billion.  The transaction gives Cabot a high-margin business thatâ€™s
not subject to the cyclicality of some other chemicals, Cabot
said in a statement today.  Cabot expects to finance the purchase with $200 million in
cash, and $300 million in borrowings under its existing
revolver, according to the statement. The Boston-based company
plans to issue approxximately $600 million of long-term debt
prior to closing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
