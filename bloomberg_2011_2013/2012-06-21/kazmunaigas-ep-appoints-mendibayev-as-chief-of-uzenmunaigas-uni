KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan â€™s state energy company,
appointed Abzal Mendibayev as chief executive officer of its
Uzenmunaigas division.  Uzenmunaigas, which pumps oil in western Kazakhstan, also
named Abat Nurseitov as chairman at its first board meeting in
Zhanaozen today, KazMunaiGas EP said in an e-mailed statement.  Uzenmunaigas suffered labor strikes and violent protests in
2011 as workers demanded higher pay. The disruption underpinned
a 7 percent drop in oil output at KazMunaiGas EP over the year.  KazMunaiGas EP made Uzenmunaigas a joint stock company this
year on the instruction of Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev .  To contact the reporter on this story:
