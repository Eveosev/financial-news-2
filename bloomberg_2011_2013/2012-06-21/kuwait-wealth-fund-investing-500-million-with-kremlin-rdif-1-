Kuwait Investment Authority , the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, will invest $500 million in
private equity together with the Kremlin-backed Russia Direct
Investment Fund, Managing Director Bader Mohammad Al-Saad said
today in St. Petersburg.  The Kremlin established the RDIF a year ago to help lure
foreign investment and expertise in its drive to wean the
world’s largest energy supplier off its dependence on commodity
exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
