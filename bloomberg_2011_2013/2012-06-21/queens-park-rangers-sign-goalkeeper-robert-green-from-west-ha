Premier League team Queens Park
Rangers signed goalkeeper  Robert Green  from West Ham, newly
promoted to English soccer’s top division.  Green, 32, joins on a two-year contract, which will start
July 1 after his deal with the Hammers expires, QPR said in a
 statement  on its website. He has made 12 appearances for  England 
and is currently with the national squad at the European
Championship in Poland and Ukraine.  Green has played more than 480 club games, having begun his
career at Norwich and spent six years at West Ham.  “Rob is someone with vast experience at international and
Premier League level and his pedigree speaks for itself,” QPR
manager  Mark Hughes  told the website.  QPR finished one place above the three-team relegation zone
last season, while West Ham won promotion through the
Championship playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
