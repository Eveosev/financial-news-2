The ruble weakened the most against
the dollar in three weeks as oil,  Russia ’s main export earner,
declined.  The Russian currency weakened 1.3 percent to 32.96 per
dollar by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest drop since May
31. The country’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due July 2018
dropped, increasing the yield by three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.672 percent.  Brent crude sank 2 percent to $90.88 a barrel as U.S.
inventories surged amid concern the  European debt crisis  will
drag down the global economy. Oil and gas together contribute
about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue, according to the
government’s estimates. President  Vladimir Putin  hosted foreign
investors today at the  St. Petersburg International Economic
Forum .  “Not one responsible expert today will try to forecast the
oil price,”  German Gref , the head of the nation’s biggest
lender, OAO Sberbank, told reporters on the sidelines of the
forum. “Accordingly, that’s what determines the ruble rate.”  Russia’s dependence on energy prices means the ruble is
just as likely to slide to 38 per dollar as strengthen to 28,
Gref said.  The ruble lost 0.7 percent to 41.5975 per euro and 1
percent to 36.8469 against the central bank’s dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.6595 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.0465 per
dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
