Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  is preparing
to clear an unexploded World War II-era mine from beside a North
Sea pipeline system that carries around 10 percent of the U.K.â€™s
natural gas to shore, the International Oil Daily reported,
citing the company.  The Royal Navy had previously recommended that the British-
made mine be left in place about 100 kilometers (62 miles)
offshore near the Far North Liquids and Associated Gas System
pipeline, the IOD reported today.  The development of new mine-clearing technologies since its
initial discovery in 1993 has made its removal and disposal
possible, the IOD said, citing Shell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
