The U.S. Supreme Court didn’t rule
on President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law today, pushing the
decision into next week, when the justices are scheduled to
complete their nine-month term.  The justices will convene again June 25 and probably at
least one additional day next week.  The health-care ruling promises to be one of the court’s
most significant decisions in decades, determining the fate of
Obama’s signature domestic achievement. The law would extend
insurance to at least 30 million people and overhaul an industry
that that makes up about 18 percent of the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
