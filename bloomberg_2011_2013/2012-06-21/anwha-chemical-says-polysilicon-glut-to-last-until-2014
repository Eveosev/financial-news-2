The oversupply of polysilicon on
world markets may last until at least 2014, pushing more high-
cost producers of the raw material used for solar panels into
bankruptcy,  Hanwha Chemical Corp. (009830)  said.  The unit of Hanwha Group, which has built a supply chain of
solar businesses through acquisitions since 2010, is “skeptical
for the moment” about acquisitions as many of the polysilicon
assets put up for sale are inefficient, Senior Vice President
J.C. Song said in an interview in Seoul.  “The polysilicon prices are now covering cash costs at a
handful of top-tier producers, which means they are below
production costs for the remaining ones,” Song said yesterday.
“While it limits expansion and new entrances, the glut may
continue until 2014 or 2015.”  Prices of  polysilicon  have slumped by two-thirds in the
past year, dropping to $22.63 in the week ended June 11,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance’s survey of spot
prices.  Song estimated costs at top producers would range from $25
per kilogram to $30. Separately, he said production costs at
companies with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons such as
Hanwha’s would be at least 30 percent less than at lines with a
3,000-ton capacity, which most producers have.  Hanwha Chemical, which owns half of the seventh-largest
solar panel producer, is spending 1 trillion won ($869 million)
building the first polysilicon plant in Yeosu,  South Korea .  Once the plant, capable of producing 10,000 tons a year,
begins commercial production in 2014, about half of the output
will be sold to Hanwha SolarOne Co., the Qidong-based
photovoltaic module maker that Hanwha bought half of for 430
billion won in 2010, Song said.  ‘Glut Concern’  “When we first studied whether to build a plant or buy,
the material was in shortage and no one offered a long-term
supply,” Song said. The construction plan, meanwhile, “is on
track as planned regardless of the glut concern because it’s
important to have flexibility in the next negotiations on
whether to build or buy.”  Hanwha’s investment plan is taking place at a time when
rivals have scaled back expansion or scrapped investments. OCI,
South  Korea ’s biggest polysilicon maker, put on hold
construction of a new  production line  while  LG Chem Ltd. (051910) , South
Korea’s biggest chemical maker, postponed a plan to build its
first polysilicon plant in Korea.  Song said he’s confident about cost-efficiencies at the
proposed plant, which would produce products at costs that top-
tier producers such as  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH)  and OCI do.  He attributed Hanwha’s confidence to know-how obtained as
South Korea’s biggest maker of chlorine-alkali chemicals and to
benefits from cutting utility costs by $2-3 per kilograms
through gas and other pipelines shared with its petrochemical
plant. Hanwha Chemical shares fell 0.5 percent to 21,100 won at
10:35 a.m. in  Seoul  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
