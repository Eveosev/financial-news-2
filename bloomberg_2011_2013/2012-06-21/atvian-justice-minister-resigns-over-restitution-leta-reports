Latvian Justice Minister Gaidis Berzins resigned yesterday, citing disagreements with the prime
minister over a proposal for restitution of Jewish property,
Leta reported.  Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Berzins have
different views over the proposal, which would allow the
transfer of property whose heirs died in the Holocaust to Jewish
religious and social organizations, the Riga-based newswire
reported, citing Liga Adamsone, Berzinsâ€™s spokeswoman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
