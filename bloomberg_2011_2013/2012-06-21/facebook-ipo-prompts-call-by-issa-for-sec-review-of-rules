Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s initial public
offering demonstrated flaws in U.S. securities laws that must be
fixed, according to House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee Chairman  Darrell Issa .  “The  Facebook IPO  taught us that, at a minimum, the IPO
process suffers substantial flaws,” Issa wrote in a June 19
letter to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman  Mary Schapiro . “In fact, it appears the entire IPO regulatory
framework, based on an outdated  Securities Act  of 1933, fails to
provide a market-based solution to IPO pricing.”  In a 15-page letter, Issa also raised questions about
whether underwriters have too much power to determine the share
price of an IPO.  Morgan Stanley (MS) , Facebook’s lead underwriter,
has been criticized for improperly pricing the Menlo Park,
California-based social networking company at $38 during the May
18 IPO.  Facebook rose 0.8 percent to $31.84 at the close in New
York today.  “The share price decline that followed the Facebook IPO
creates concerns that the securities regulation under the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) places substantial
discretion in the hands of underwriters,” Issa wrote to
Schapiro. “One chief concern relates to the ability of
underwriters to dictate pricing while only indirectly
considering market supply-and-demand in their price
evaluation.”  IPO Questions  Issa asks Schapiro to respond by July 3 to questions that
include how IPOs are priced and how information is communicated
to investors in advance of an offer.  John Nester , a spokesman for the SEC, declined to comment
on the letter, which was reported earlier today by The Wall
Street Journal. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment.  Facebook’s IPO has been dogged by two central issues. A
technical glitch at  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  on the morning of the
IPO prevented 30 million shares from participating in the
auction. Meanwhile, Facebook faces lawsuits filed by retail
investors who claim that some institutional investors received
advance word of a potential revenue decline at the company that
retail investors weren’t privy to.  Schapiro has said the Facebook IPO raises “issues” for
the SEC to review.  “The IPO has probably worked pretty well for many years
but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take this opportunity to step
back and look at whether the rules and regulations in place need
to be updated to look at whether the technology and mechanisms
through which people participate in the IPO process need to be
looked at,” she said in an interview on CNBC today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
