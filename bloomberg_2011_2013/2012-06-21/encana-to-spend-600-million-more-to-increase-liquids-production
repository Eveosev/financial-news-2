Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s biggest
natural-gas producer by volume, plans to invest an additional
$600 million this year as it boosts production of higher-priced
petroleum liquids.  Liquids output this year will increase 7 percent more than
forecast to 30,000 barrels a day and will range between 60,000
barrels and 70,000 barrels a day in 2013, Calgary-based Encana
said today in a statement. Encana said in February it planned to
invest $2.9 billion in 2012, 37 percent lower than in 2011.  Natural gas prices in  North America , where production
soared amid a boom in hydraulic fracturing, fell to their lowest
quarterly average in 10 years in the first quarter. Gas output
is forecast to remain near current levels of about 3 billion
cubic feet per day in 2012 and 2013, Encana said.  “Encana continues to be cautiously optimistic about a
recovery in natural gas prices towards the end of 2012 and
2013,” the company said today. “The company will continue to
minimize natural gas investments, in an effort to preserve the
value of its vast resource base until stronger more sustainable
natural gas prices prevail.”  The company said it plans to drill between 115 and 120
wells in 2012 in 10 areas mainly focused on oil, compared with
an initial target of 40 to 45 wells. Encana expects to drill
about 350 oil and liquids wells in 2013, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
