The following is the text of
 Canada ’s retail sales report for April as released by
 Statistics Canada .  Retail sales declined 0.5% to $38.9 billion in April, more
than offsetting the gain in March. Lower sales were reported in
8 of 11 subsectors, representing 78% of retail sales.  In volume terms, retail sales decreased 0.8%, the third
decline in four months.  Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers fell 1.2% in April,
more than offsetting the rise in March. Lower receipts at new
car dealers (-1.4%) accounted for most of the decrease. Used car
dealers (-2.5%) also reported a decline, following four
consecutive monthly increases. Sales rose at automotive parts,
accessories and tire stores (+1.1%) and other  motor vehicle 
dealers (+0.1%).  Lower retail receipts in certain store types in April
largely reflected the advance of spring merchandise sales
observed in March.  Following six straight monthly gains, sales at clothing and
clothing accessories stores declined 2.8%, with lower sales
reported by all store types within this subsector.  General merchandise stores registered a 0.6% decrease.
Department store sales declined 1.2%, partially offsetting the
gain in March. Sales at other general merchandise stores edged
down 0.2%, after advancing for five straight months.  Sales at sporting goods, hobby, book and music stores fell
2.6%, following an increase in March. The decrease largely
reflected weaker sales at sporting goods stores.  After two consecutive monthly gains, sales at building
material and garden equipment and supplies dealers decreased
0.9%.  Food and beverage store receipts declined 0.3% in April.
Lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores (-0.5%)
accounted for most of the decline.  Gasoline stations (+1.1%) registered higher sales in April,
offsetting the decline registered in March.  Sales decline in four provinces  Retail sales declines in April were limited to the four
most populous provinces. These provinces account for about 85%
of total retail sales.  Ontario (-1.1%) reported the largest decline. This more
than offset March’s gain, which was influenced by warmer than

consecutive monthly decline.  Sales in Alberta edged down 0.2%, after increasing in March.  After three consecutive monthly gains, British Columbia
