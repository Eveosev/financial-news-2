The Polish zloty weakened for a
second day after the  Federal Reserve  cut U.S. growth estimates
and a report showed German manufacturing probably shrank in
June, curbing appetite for riskier emerging-market assets.  The zloty depreciated 0.2 percent to 4.2539 per euro as of
11:57 a.m. in Warsaw, paring this month’s gain to 3.2 percent.  Fed officials pared their estimate for economic growth in
2012 to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent and extended stimulus known
as Operation Twist. German manufacturing probably shrank for a
fourth month in June, according to a purchasing managers’ index
compiled by  Markit Economics . The PMI fell to 44.7 from 45.2 in
May. Germany is Poland’s biggest export market.  “Some disappointment with Fed meeting has sparked a
moderate correction on the zloty,” Piotr Bujak, chief economist
for Poland at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients.  Fourteen out of 17 currencies in eastern Europe retreated
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
