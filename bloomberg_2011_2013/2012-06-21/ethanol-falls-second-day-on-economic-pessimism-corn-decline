Ethanol fell for a second day in
 Chicago , following corn lower, on concern that the global
economy is slowing.  Futures declined after reports showed manufacturing in the
U.S., China and  Europe  slumped and as sales of existing homes
fell in May to a level lower than analysts had expected.  “All commodities were feeling the pain today and ethanol
is being dragged off the cliff with the rest of them,” said
Peyton Feltus, president of Randolph Risk Management in  Dallas .  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slid 3.4 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.055 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have fallen 6.7 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.125 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.155, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slumped 4 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$2.045 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive slipped 1 cent
to $2.125.  Corn futures for December delivery declined 2.9 percent to
settle at $5.50 a bushel on the CBOT, the biggest drop since
June 5, on speculation that cooler weather and rain in the
Midwest will aid crop development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
