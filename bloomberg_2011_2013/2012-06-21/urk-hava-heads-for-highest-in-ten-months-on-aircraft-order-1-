Turk Hava Yollari AO (THYAO) , or Turkish
Airlines, headed for the highest in more than 10 months after
saying it will order at least 15 jumbo airliners as early as
next month and is looking at about 10 acquisition prospects.  The stock advanced 2.1 percent to 2.94 liras at 10:52 a.m.
in Istanbul, on course for its strongest level since August
2011. Volume of shares traded so far in the session is 56
percent of the stock’s three-month average. Turk Hava is up 17
percent this month, outperforming the ISE National 100 Index’s
8.2 percent rise.  The airline, Europe’s fifth biggest, plans to purchase
Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8 planes valued at about $4 billion
for delivery after 2014, Chairman Hamdi Topcu said in an
interview with Bloomberg in Istanbul.  The airline is looking at takeover prospects in  Africa ,
Asia and the  Middle East  as it seeks to establish hubs in Africa
and Asia, Topcu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
