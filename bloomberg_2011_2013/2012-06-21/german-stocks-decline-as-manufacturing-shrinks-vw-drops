German stocks  sank the most in two
weeks as the nation’s manufacturing contracted more than
expected, the  Federal Reserve  cut its U.S. growth forecast and
factory output in the Philadelphia region shrank.  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , the world’s second-largest carmaker, fell
3.1 percent.  SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of enterprise software,
dropped 2.7 percent.  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , the operator of the
 Frankfurt  stock exchange, declined 2 percent.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  slid 0.8 percent to 6,343.13 at the close of
trading in Frankfurt, the largest drop since June 4. The
benchmark gauge has fallen 11 percent from its 2012 high on
March 16 amid growing concern that  Greece  will be forced to
leave the euro. The broader HDAX Index lost 0.7 percent today.  Fed officials cut their estimate for economic growth in
2012 to 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent, down from an April forecast
of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent. The central bank expanded its so-
called Operation Twist program at the end of a two-day meeting
yesterday, replacing $267 billion of short-term bonds with
longer-term debt through the end of 2012.  “There is not a lot of flexibility for the Fed to do more
so it is not surprising that the reaction to yesterday’s
expansion of stimulus is not necessarily positive,” said
Felicity Smith, a  fund manager  at Bedlam Asset Management in
 London . “You can’t just pump money into the system and hope
that growth comes out the other end.”  Manufacturing Shrinks  A purchasing managers’ index compiled by  Markit Economics 
showed that  German manufacturing  probably shrank for a fourth
month in June. The PMI fell to 44.7 from 45.2 in May, missing
the median economist forecast of 45.2 in a Bloomberg survey.
Readings less than 50 indicate contraction.  In the U.S.,  Philadelphia manufacturing  shrank in June at
the fastest pace in almost a year. The Fed Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index fell to minus 16.6 in
June, the lowest level since August, from minus 5.8 the previous
month. Economists forecast the gauge would improve to zero, the
dividing line between growth and contraction, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  China ’s manufacturing may decline for an eighth month in
June, matching the streak during the global financial crisis in
a signal the government’s stimulus has yet to reverse the
economy’s slowdown, another survey by HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics showed.  Spanish Bonds  The DAX earlier advanced as much as 0.6 percent as  Spain 
sold 2.22 billion euros ($2.8 billion) of bonds, beating the 2
billion-euro maximum target.  Spain paid 4.706 percent to borrow for two years, compared
with 2.069 percent at a similar auction in March. Demand for the
April 2014 securities was 3.97 times the amount allotted,
compared with 2.81 times in March. The so-called bid-to-cover
ratios also climbed for the July 2015 and July 2017 securities
offered today.  Preferred shares of Volkswagen fell 3.1 percent to 123.70
euros, snapping a four-day gain. SAP dropped 2.7 percent to
46.40 euros.  Deutsche Boerse  declined 2 percent to 39.89 euros. The
exchange is set to see “strong” second-quarter results on
frenetic trading, based upon uncertainty in the euro area,
according to Berenberg Bank. Still, tough comparisons lie ahead,
particularly in August, Berenberg said.  Fresenius Medical Care AG, the world’s biggest provider of
 kidney dialysis , rose 1.1 percent to 54.69 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
