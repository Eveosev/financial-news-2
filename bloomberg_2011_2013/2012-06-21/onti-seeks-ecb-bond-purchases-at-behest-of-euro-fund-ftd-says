Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s
bond-purchasing plan envisions the  European Central Bank  buying
sovereign debt at the behest of the euro bailout fund,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reported.  The bailout fund -- either the current European Financial
Stability Facility or the permanent European Stability Mechanism
-- would in return guarantee a portion of the ECB’s debt
purchases against losses, the newspaper said, citing two
unidentified euro-area officials.  The proposal will be discussed by euro finance ministers
today in Luxembourg as well as the leaders of Germany, France,
Italy and Spain tomorrow at a four-way summit in Rome, FTD said.
Monti’s plan has so far been framed as the EFSF or ESM making
such purchases with its resources, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
