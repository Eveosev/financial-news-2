Etrion Corp., (ETX)  a producer of solar
energy, rose the most ever in  Stockholm  trading after saying the
company is negotiating its first contract in Chile and that its
output in  Italy  was higher than expected.  The shares rose as much 44 percent, the biggest intraday
jump since the stock was listed in Stockholm in November 2010.
Etrion traded 37 percent higher at 2.91 kronor as of 12:27 p.m.
and was the biggest gainer in the OMX Stockholm All-Share index.
The shares are also listed in Toronto.  Etrion is in talks about constructing a 5-megawatt solar
power project in Chile by 2013, the Geneva-based company said
today in a statement. The deal would be Etrion’s first power
purchase agreement in that market and may be followed by
additional contracts with mining companies before year-end, the
company said.  The company has also access to long-term financing in  Chile 
at “competitive terms,” which will help the company develop
even if subsidies change, Chief Executive Officer Marco A. Northland said in the statement.  “I am very pleased with the progress we are making in
Chile,” Northland said. “Long-term cost reduction trends in
solar should enable Etrion to become ever more competitive with
other sources of energy.”  The company currently has about 60 megawatts of ground-
based solar power production in Italy. The plants produced 40
million kilowatt hours of electricity in the first five months
of 2012, which was 10 percent more than expected, Etrion said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
