Elbit Imaging Ltd. (EMIT)  headed for the
biggest gain in almost two months after the Israeli real estate
company closed the sale of U.S. shopping centers for $1.4
billion.  The  shares  advanced 6.1 percent, poised for the largest
advance since April 22, to 9.231 shekels at 11:48 a.m. in  Tel
Aviv .  The sale of the properties was to Blackstone Group LP and
 DDR Corp. (DDR) , Elbit said in a PR Newswire statement today. “The
closing of this transaction generated significant cash-flow and
profit for the company, over an investment period of two years
only,” co-Chief Executive Officer Dudi Machluf said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
