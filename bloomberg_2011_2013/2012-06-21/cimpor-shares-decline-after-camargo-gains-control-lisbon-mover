Cimpor-Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA ,
the country’s biggest cement company, dropped the most in more
than 10 months after Camargo Correa SA gained control of 94.8
percent of the company.  The Brazilian cement maker raised its stake in the company
after offering 5.50 euros a share on March 30 to buy the rest of
Cimpor it didn’t already own.  The stock  declined  as much as 5.9 percent to 5.122 euros,
the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 5 and traded down 5.4
percent at 5.15 euros as of 10:02 a.m. in Lisbon. The shares
will be excluded from  Portugal ’s PSI-20 benchmark index
tomorrow, Euronext said in a statement yesterday.  Camargo hasn’t decided whether to remove Cimpor from
trading in Lisbon, Jose Edison, president of Camargo’s
Intercement unit, said yesterday at a presentation at the Lisbon
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
