Storms starting tonight may bring
heavy rains to the U.K. in coming days, potentially causing
flooding in northwestern areas, the  Met Office  said.  Widespread rains of 50 millimeters (2 inches) may occur
before storms ease on June 23, with winds reaching 50 miles per
hour, the U.K.’s weather forecaster said in a  statement  on its
website. The county of Lancashire may receive more than 100
millimeters tomorrow afternoon, while Manchester, Merseyside and
areas of  Wales  get about 70 millimeters, according to the
report. Those areas should “remain vigilant and prepared for
flooding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
