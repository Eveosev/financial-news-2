of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 34 percent
in the latest week in the absence of deliveries to  Algeria , the
main destination for  France ’s wheat.  Cargoes slid to 60,368 metric tons between June 14 and June
20 from 91,772 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port  wrote
in an e-mailed report today. That included 45,086 tons of soft
wheat, down from 86,302 tons in the previous week, when 52,840
tons of the grain were dispatched to Algeria.  Cameroon was the main destination in the latest week with
15,750 tons of soft wheat, ahead of  Ivory Coast  with 9,095 tons.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of France’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
