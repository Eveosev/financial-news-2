Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  slipped 0.7
percent to 2,245.58 at the close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS PW), the country’s second-largest
refiner, declined 2.4 percent to 27.49 zloty as oil dropped to
the lowest price in eight months after U.S. stockpiles
unexpectedly increased.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN)  , Poland’s biggest
refiner, retreated 0.6 percent to 36.72 zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, lost 2.5 percent to 143.3 zloty,
falling for a second day. The metal fell on concern demand may
weaken after an index showed Chinese manufacturing may shrink
for an eighth month and the  Federal Reserve  cut its U.S. growth
forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
