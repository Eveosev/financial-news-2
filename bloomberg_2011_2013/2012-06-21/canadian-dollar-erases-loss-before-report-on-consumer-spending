Canada’s dollar erased a loss as
commodities declined before a Statistics Canada report that
economists predict will show retail sales slowed in April.  The currency was little changed against its U.S.
counterpart, which rose against most major peers after the
 Federal Reserve  fulfilled analysts’ expectations by extending a
measure of monetary stimulus yesterday. Bank of Canada Governor
 Mark Carney  is due to speak in Halifax, Nova Scotia, today.  “The Fed did exactly what the market was expecting,”
 Steven Saywell , head of currency strategy for Europe at BNP
Paribas SA in London, said in a telephone interview. “There’s
already been a significant risk rally in the past two weeks, and
we’re taking a breather. We will continue to see a risk rally
and dollar weakness on expectations of further easing. We see
the Canadian dollar moving back down towards parity.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, traded at C$1.0184  U.S. dollar 
at 7:54 a.m. in Toronto after weakening as much as 0.4 percent.
One Canadian dollar buys 98.19 U.S. cents. The loonie is headed
for a 0.4 percent advance this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
