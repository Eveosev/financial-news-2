The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 1.3 percent to 568.10 at 4:19 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
1.1 percent to 1424.207.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped to the lowest price in eight months in  New York 
after U.S. stockpiles unexpectedly increased and a report
signaled China’s manufacturing will shrink this month.  Oil for August delivery slid as much as $1.34 to $80.11 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest price for a front-month contract since Oct.
6. It was at $80.42 at 2:41 p.m. Singapore time. Futures are
down 19 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas rose in New York after falling yesterday on
forecasts that showed the weather will cool following this
week’s heat wave in the eastern U.S.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  rose 48 cents to a premium of 96 cents
a barrel to Asian marker Dubai crude at 11:35 a.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
That’s the widest gap so far this week.  Fuel-oil swaps for July fell $13.25, or 2.2 percent, to
$582.50 a metric ton, PVM said. That’s the lowest since June 4.
The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade,
or the viscosity spread, was unchanged after climbing to $9.75.
This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved in tandem with higher-
quality supplies used in power stations.  Naphtha swaps for July declined $21.25, or 2.9 percent, to
$713.75 a ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock was down for a third day.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
decreased $19.14 to $17.53 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of processing profit,
was the narrowest in a week.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha yesterday rebounded 41 cents
to $19.07 a barrel, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. A wider
reforming margin indicates it is more profitable to make motor
fuel.  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Dubai crude increased
$2.57 to $19.38 a barrel, according to PVM. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, widened the most since March last
year.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined for a third day in the longest losing run in
a month after the  Federal Reserve  extended its Operation Twist
program while refraining from additional debt purchases. Silver,
platinum and palladium retreated.  Spot gold fell as much as 0.6 percent to $1,597.50 an
ounce, and was at $1,602.95 at 1:41 p.m. in Singapore. Bullion
dropped to a one-week low yesterday after the Fed extended its
program of replacing short-term bonds with longer-term debt by
$267 billion through the end of 2012.  August-delivery bullion fell for a fourth day on the Comex
in New York, losing as much as 1.1 percent to $1,598.10 an ounce
before trading at $1,603.50. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust,
the biggest exchange-traded product backed by bullion, were at a
one-month high of 1,281.62 metric tons yesterday, unchanged
since June 18, the company’s website showed.  Spot silver declined for a third day, falling as much as
1.5 percent to $27.725 an ounce, and was last at $27.9675. Cash
platinum dropped for a third day, sliding as much as 0.6 percent
to $1,450 an ounce before trading at $1,457.45. Palladium
retreated 0.5 percent to $616.33 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper extended losses as  China ’s manufacturing may shrink
for an eighth month and the U.S. Federal Reserve cut growth
forecasts, sending commodities to the lowest level since
November 2010.  Copper slid as much as 1.8 percent to $7,410 a metric ton,
the lowest level since June 14, on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $7,423.25 at 3:28 p.m. Shanghai time. September
delivery metal on the Comex fell 1.3 percent to $3.3535 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil dropped after the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced its
2012 growth outlook and its pledge to expand a stimulus program
fell short of investor expectations, sending a commodities
benchmark to the lowest level in 19 months.  September-delivery  palm oil  retreated as much as 1.8
percent to 2,986 ringgit ($942) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, after closing yesterday at the highest
price for the most-active contract since May 31. Futures were at
2,993 ringgit by the close of the morning session in  Kuala
Lumpur , extending this month’s loss to 3.5 percent. Palm oil for
January delivery dropped 1.5 percent to 7,900 yuan ($1,241) a
ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.8 percent to
$13.84 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for
December delivery lost 0.7 percent to 51.29 cents a pound. Palm
oil and soybean oil are both used in foods and fuels. Soybean
oil for January delivery fell 1 percent to 9,414  yuan  a ton.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to $5.615 after
jumping 11 percent in the past two days, the most since October
2010. Wheat for December delivery added 0.2 percent to $6.9475 a
bushel.  Rubber slumped by the most in a week after the U.S. Federal
Reserve cut growth estimates for the world’s largest economy,
raising concerns demand may weaken.  To contact the reporter on this story:
