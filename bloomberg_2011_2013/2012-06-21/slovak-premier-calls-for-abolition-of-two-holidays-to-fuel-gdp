Slovak Prime Minister  Robert Fico 
proposed abolishing two of the country’s 14 public holidays,
saying the additional working days would offset austerity
measures.  The Cabinet is considering ending the Sept. 1 Constitution
Day and move the Sept. 15 Virgin Mary holiday to a weekend, Fico
said today at a press conference in the Slovak capital,
Bratislava today. Each move may add as much as 0.2 percentage
point to economic growth, he said.  The government wants to offset the impact of higher taxes
and spending cuts on the economy as the country works to bring
the budget  deficit  below the European Union’s limit of 3 percent
of gross domestic product by 2013 from 4.6 percent targeted for
this year. The  Finance Ministry  on June 15 cut its forecast for
next year’s growth to 2.6 percent from 2.7 percent.  Fico, whose Smer party won elections in June on pledges to
insulate poorer citizens from the economic slowdown, wants to
abolish the 19 percent flat income tax. Corporate rate is set to
rise to 23 percent, while individuals will pay a 25 percent tax
on income exceeding 3.246 euros a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
