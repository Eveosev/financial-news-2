U.K. prosecutors are considering
criminal charges against four more journalists in a probe of
phone-hacking at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s now-defunct News of the World
tabloid in Britain.  Files given to prosecutors by the Metropolitan Police on
June 19 in London outline claims including violations of
Britain’s law against intercepting communications, the  Crown
Prosecution Service  said today in a statement. The agency is now
reviewing possible charges in more than a dozen cases.  “We are unable to give any timescale for charging
decisions, except to say that these cases are being considered
very carefully and thoroughly,” CPS said in the statement,
without identifying the suspects.  The Met has arrested more than 50 people in three probes of
voice-mail interception, computer hacking and bribery by the
newspaper and another News Corp. title, the Sun.  Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive officer of News
Corp.’s British publishing unit, was charged last month with
perverting the course of justice in the case and is scheduled to
appear in court tomorrow. She has denied the claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
