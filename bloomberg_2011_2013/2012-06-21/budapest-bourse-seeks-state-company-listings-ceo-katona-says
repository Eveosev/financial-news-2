The Budapest Stock Exchange wants to
attract state-owned companies to help reverse a decline in
trading volumes, Chief Executive Officer Zsolt Katona said. The
government said it doesn’t see any listings coming.  The exchange probably won’t attract entrants of the size of
the two biggest listed companies,  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest
refiner, and  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , its biggest lender, said Katona,
who was appointed last month. Katona would be “very happy” if
the government listed 10 percent of electricity wholesaler MVM
Zrt. He also cited Mol, in which the government last year bought
a 21 percent stake from OAO Surgutneftegas, without delisting it
from the bourse.  “Besides smaller- and medium-size enterprises, it is our
aim to bring state companies to the bourse,” Katona told a
conference in Budapest today.  Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has bought stakes
in companies deemed strategic in contrast to other European
countries from Greece to Poland which sold holdings to plug
budget holes. Hungary has no plans to list any companies, Adam
Balog, deputy state secretary at the  Economy Ministry , told the
same conference, which was organized by the bourse.  “To be frank I don’t see much chance for that,” Balog
said.  Hungary’s benchmark BUX stock index rose 0.6 percent to
17,684.95 by 4:07 p.m. in Budapest, extending its advance this
year to 4.2 percent, following a 20 percent plunge in 2011. The
MSCI  Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  has gained 2.1 percent so far in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
