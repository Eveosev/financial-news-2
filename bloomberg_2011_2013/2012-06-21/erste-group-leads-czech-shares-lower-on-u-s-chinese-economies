Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  of Austria fell,
leading Czech shares lower after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut
growth estimates for the U.S. economy and a report showed
Chinese manufacturing may shrink for an eighth month.  The stock dropped 1.3 percent to 364 koruna by 10:13 a.m.
in  Prague , after gaining 2.6 percent in the previous two days.
The 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index, in which Erste has a 19 percent
weighting, declined 0.4 percent, its second day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
