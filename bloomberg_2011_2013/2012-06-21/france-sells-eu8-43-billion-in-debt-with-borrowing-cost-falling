France  sold 8.43 billion euros in
debt, with yields falling in the first bond sale after President
 Francois Hollande  consolidated his position by winning a
majority for his party in the country’s parliament.   France’s 3.34 billion euros in five-year notes yielded on
average 1.43 percent, a record low, compared with 1.72 percent 
on May 16. The French auction contrasted with  Spain 's debt sale 
of 2.22 billion euros with borrowing costs more than doubling.   Carrying a higher  credit rating  than Spain or  Italy  and
offering better returns than German securities, France finds
itself in a sweet spot, drawing strong auction demand as bond
investors give Hollande, the country’s first Socialist president
in 17 years, the benefit of the doubt.   Hollande, who has promised to cut budget deficits, was
boosted after a majority in the June 17 legislative election for
his party and its allies paved the way for them to pass laws
without the aid of other members of parliament.   On June 18, a day after the second and decisive round of
the French legislative elections, France sold 9.1 billion euros
in one-month, three-month, five-month and 12-month bills with
yields sliding from the previous auction of the securities.  Before the sale today, French benchmark 10-year bonds
yielded 2.66 percent, with investors paying 107.6 basis points
more to hold French debt relative to comparable German bunds.  Control of the lower house of parliament will allow
Hollande to push through the tough decisions needed amid
 Europe ’s debt crisis. With growth stalling at home, Hollande
faces the task of telling the French people that the state’s
depleted coffers may mean cuts in spending and higher taxes as
he makes good on his deficit-cutting promises.  No Growth  France’s gross domestic product failed to grow in the first
three months of the year and the Bank of France predicts that
Europe’s second-largest economy may shrink in the current
quarter for the first time since the nation exited recession in
2009. French jobless claims rose for a 12th month in April to
2.89 million, the highest in 12 years.  The lack of growth means that budget cuts will probably
have to be deeper than previously estimated. The European
Commission said May 30 that France may need to take
“significant” steps to meet its target of reducing the  budget
deficit  to 3 percent of GDP next year.  France today sold 2.78 billion euros of two-year notes at
an average yield of 0.54 percent, down from 0.74 percent on May
16. It sold 1.22 billion euros of 2015 notes, paying 0.83
percent compared with 1.51 percent on Jan. 19 and 1.1 billion
euros of 2016 securities at an average yield of 1.05 percent
compared with 1.40 percent on March 15.  Later today, the country will sell as much as 1.5 billion
euros of inflation-linked bonds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
