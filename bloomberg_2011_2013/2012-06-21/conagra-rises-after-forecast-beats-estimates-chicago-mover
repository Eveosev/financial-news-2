ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) , the maker of
Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice meals, rose the most in almost
four months after its earnings forecast for fiscal 2013 exceeded
analysts’ estimates as food inflation moderates.  Earnings excluding one-time items will increase 6 percent
to 8 percent from the $1.84-a-share profit in the year that
ended May 27 because of acquisitions, growth in the potato unit
and moderating food inflation, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company
said in a statement today. The average of 13 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for profit of $1.92 a share, implying
a 4.5 percent increase.  “Expectations were pretty low,”  Jack Russo , a St. Louis-
based analyst for  Edward Jones  who has a hold rating on the
shares, said in a telephone interview. “The guidance was
slightly better than some analysts expected.”  ConAgra rose 2.7 percent $25.26 in in  New York , the biggest
gain since Feb. 23.  The stock has dropped 3 percent this year amid weak
 consumer spending  in the U.S., which according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg makes up 89 percent of the company’s sales.
ConAgra’s organic food volumes declined 5 percent in the fiscal
fourth quarter on “difficult economic conditions that are
impacting consumer purchasing behavior,” it said in the
statement.  Fourth-quarter earnings excluding pension expenses and
other items were 51 cents a share, beating the average of
analysts’ estimates by 1 cent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
