Kenya ’s shilling gained for the
seventh day, the longest winning streak in almost five months,
as the  central bank  stayed out of the market.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.3 percent and closed less than 0.1 percent higher
at 83.55 per dollar in the capital Nairobi, the longest winning
streak since Feb 1.  The Central Bank of Kenya did not offer repurchase
agreements and term-auction deposits for a second day today, a
bank official who asked not to be named in line with policy
said. The bank reintroduced term-auction deposits as a
“liquidity management” measure on June 5. Kenya sold 1.45
billion shillings ($17.3 million) of 3-months treasury bills at
today’s auction, having offered 2 billion shilling, the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Currency gains were “helped by tightening liquidity and
importers holding back on dollar purchases in anticipation of
further gains,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) , said in a note to
clients.  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.7 percent to close at 2,467 per
dollar, while Tanzania’s currency appreciated by less than 0.1
percent to close at 1,581 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
