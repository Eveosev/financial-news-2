Invensys Plc (ISYS) , the British software
and meters maker, said it held takeover talks with  Emerson
Electric Co. (EMR)  and other potential suitors, and the negotiations
ended without agreement.  The talks were “highly preliminary,” the London-based
company said in a statement today.  “The company regularly assesses the value of its portfolio
of businesses both as part of its strategic planning process and
in response to expressions of interest in relation to certain
parts of the group,” Invensys said in the statement. “These
discussions, however, are no longer ongoing.”  Invensys has periodically been the subject of takeover
speculation for a decade, having been linked to companies such
as  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest engineering company. Yesterday,
Invensys made its biggest ever gain after Bloomberg News
reported the company is considering options after an approach by
Emerson. Any deal would need to resolve pension liabilities that
are among the U.K.’s largest.  Advisers to the British company have spoken to potential
suitors including Siemens and  General Electric Co. (GE)  about a sale
of some or all of its operations since Emerson’s approach,
people familiar with the talks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
