Almost a third of Zimbabwean
lawmakers have volunteered to be tested for HIV in a campaign to
boost Aids awareness in the southern African nation, said
Patience Dube, an operations officer for Population Service
International.  About 60 of the country’s 198 legislators have been tested
so far and the program will continue tomorrow, Dube said today
in Harare, the capital.  “This helps to fight stigma associated with the disease,”
Blessing Chebundo, a lawmaker from the mining town of Kwekwe,
said after being tested.  Zimbabwe has an HIV infection rate of about 15 percent,
according to the National Aids Council, a state agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
