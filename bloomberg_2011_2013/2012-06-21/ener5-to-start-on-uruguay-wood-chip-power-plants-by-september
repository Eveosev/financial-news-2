Ener5 will begin building four wood-
chip power plants in  Uruguay  by September as the closely held
renewable-energy developer seeks to take advantage of high power
prices there.  The company was awarded contracts on Dec. 29 to sell power
at $92 a megawatt-hour to national utility Administracion
Nacional de Usinas Y Trasmisiones Electricas in an auction,
Raymond Shayo, founding director of Sao Paulo-based Ener5, said
today in a telephone interview.  Electricity prices in Uruguay’s biomass auctions are about
twice what they are in  Brazil  auctions, because Brazil relies
more on wind power, which is cheaper, Shayo said.  “Brazil prices are far too low,” he said. “You can sell
electricity here at 100 reais ($49) a megawatt-hour, compared to
$100 in Uruguay.”  The company’s two Uruguay units, Lisger SA and Beltone SA,
will build four 20-megawatt plants in the southern city of Minas
and eastern city of Treinta y Tres, he said. They will cost $200
million and run on wood fuel sourced from 40,000 hectares
(98,840 acres) of eucalyptus forests.  Some of the equity for the project may be provided by
European and Brazilian companies, he said. The Inter-American
Development Bank and Uruguayan lenders have expressed an
interest in financing the ventures.  Ener5, which has developed a wind and biomass project in
Brazil, expects the plants to come online through 2015, he said.  Uruguay will produce as much as 15 percent of its power
from biomass in 2015, up from 8 percent now, Ramon Mendez,
director of energy at the Ministry of Industry, Energy and
Mining, said June 18 in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
