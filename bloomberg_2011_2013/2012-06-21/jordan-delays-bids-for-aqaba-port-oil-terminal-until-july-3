Jordan delayed until July 3 the
deadline for contractors to apply to prequalify as bidders for
engineering, procurement and construction work on an oil
terminal at the Red Sea port of Aqaba.  The initial deadline for the facility, with a planned
capacity of 120,000 cubic meters, was June 21, the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources said in a statement on its website
today. The terminal would allow for the storage and distribution
of imported crude and oil products, according to the ministry,
which didnâ€™t give a reason for the delay.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports almost all of its energy. Its  power plants  have had to
switch to more expensive fuels after repeated cuts in natural-
gas shipments caused by sabotage attacks on an export pipeline
from neighboring  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
