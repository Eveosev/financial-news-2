Pfizer Inc. (PFE) ’s second-best selling
drug, Lyrica, was approved by U.S. regulators today for use
against pain caused by spinal cord injuries.  The  Food and Drug Administration  cleared the expanded use
of Lyrica, already backed to treat nerve pain from fibromyalgia,
diabetic nerve pain and pain after shingles, New York-based
Pfizer, said today in a statement. Pfizer estimates a potential
patient population size of about 100,000 people.  “Until now, no FDA approved treatment options were
available in the U.S. for people with neuropathic pain
associated with spinal cord injury, a condition which can be
extremely disabling,” said Steven J. Romano, senior vice
president and head of Pfizer’s medicines development group,
Global Primary Care business unit, in the statement.  Lyrica is Pfizer’s best-selling drug after cholesterol pill
Lipitor, which lost patent protection in November. It had $3.39
billion in revenue last year. The treatment has patent
protection until 2018, and Pfizer is working to expand its use.  Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $22.60 at the close
in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
