The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.6 percent to 902.10, the highest close since May 11.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)   increased 0.4 percent to 733 koruna after
Mlada Fronta Dnes cited billionaire Pavel Tykac as saying he was
ready to pay more for the biggest Czech utility’s Pocerady and
Chvaletice coal-fired power stations than other bidders.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, dropped 1.9 percent to 101 koruna, a second day
of losses. Commodities dropped to the lowest in almost 19 months
after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its growth outlook for the
world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
