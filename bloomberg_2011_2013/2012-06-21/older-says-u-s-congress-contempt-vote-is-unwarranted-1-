A decision by a congressional
committee to hold U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt
was “unwarranted, unnecessary and unprecedented,” he said.  The issue may still be resolved through negotiations before
a scheduled vote in the full House next week, Holder said today,
speaking to reporters in Copenhagen.  The Oversight and Government Reform Committee yesterday
made Holder the first Cabinet official held in contempt by a
congressional panel in 14 years. House Speaker  John Boehner  and
Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  said the full House will vote next
week on the matter.  The panel’s party-line contempt resolution is the latest
escalation in a standoff that began last year over documents
related to the Fast and Furious gun operation, which allowed
illegally purchased firearms from the U.S. to wind up in  Mexico .  “We put before the committee a proposal that would have
allowed for a resolution of that matter, consistent with the way
in which these have been resolved in the past,” Holder said.
“The action that the committee took was unwarranted, unnecessary
and unprecedented.”  Holder was in Copenhagen to meet with Morten Boedskov, the
justice minister of  Denmark , which holds the rotating presidency
of the European Union. They were scheduled to discuss data
protection, migratory policies and the fight against terrorism,
according to a statement issued by the Danish government.  “The House has to consider now with the leadership what
they will do and so we’ll see how it works out,” Holder said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
