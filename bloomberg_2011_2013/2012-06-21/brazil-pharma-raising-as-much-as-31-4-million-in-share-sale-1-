the pharmacy chain spun off by Banco BTG Pactual SA last year,
are raising as much as 64.75 million reais ($31.4 million) in a
secondary offering.  Stockholders of the Sao Paulo-based company are selling as
many as 7 million shares for 9.25 reais each, according to a
regulatory filing today.  Brazil Pharma debuted on the Sao Paulo exchange in June
2011 after selling 48 million shares for 8.62 reais each. The
stock has risen 16 percent since then, while the benchmark
Bovespa index fell 11 percent.  Banco BTG Pactual  controls  30 percent of the company,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Other shareholders are
investment funds and previous owners of regional pharmacy chains
Brazil Pharma acquired.  The new shares start trading in  Sao Paulo  on June 25.
They’re listed in Novo Mercado, a segment of the stock exchange
that mandates stricter requirements regarding disclosure and
minority shareholders’ rights.  Brazil Pharma is the country’s third biggest pharmacy chain
with 643 stores of its own and 355 franchise locations,
according to the industry association Abrafarma.  To contact the reporter on this story:
