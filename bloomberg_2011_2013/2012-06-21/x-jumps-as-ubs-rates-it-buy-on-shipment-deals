LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3)  rose to the highest
in a month in Sao Paulo after  UBS AG (UBSN)  rated the logistics company
owned by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista a buy because of
potential oil shipment contracts.  LLX jumped 2.9 percent to 2.52 reais today in Sao Paulo,
the highest close since May 21, and is up 14 percent in the past
three days.  Batista, Brazil’s richest man, plans to use LLX’s Acu port
in Rio de Janeiro state as a hub to ship iron ore, steel, oil
and cars produced by his companies and joint ventures to China.  The company, based in Rio, is negotiating two contracts for
oil shipment services totaling 1.2 million barrels per year that
will likely be announced before the end of the year, UBS analyst
Marimar Torreblanca said in a report yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
