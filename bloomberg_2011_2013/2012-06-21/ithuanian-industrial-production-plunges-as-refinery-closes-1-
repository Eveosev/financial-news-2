Lithuanian  industrial production 
fell the most in 32 months in May as energy output plunged
because of the closure of the Orlen Lietuva AB oil refinery for
maintenance.  Production tumbled 14.6 percent, the biggest drop since
September 2009, compared with a 6.8 percent increase in April,
the  statistics office , based in the capital, Vilnius, said today
in a statement on its website. Manufacturing excluding energy
products grew 8.7 percent, compared with a 1.7 percent advance
the previous month.  The Baltic nation’s largest company by sales, Orlen
Lietuva, the Lithuanian unit of  Poland ’s PKN Orlen SA, halted
production for a month to carry out the biggest upgrades and
repairs in the refinery’s history. Output resumed June 6.  “The May results are somewhat reassuring because
industrial output continues to rise” when the impact of the
refinery is excluded, said Rokas Bancevicius, an economist at
DnB Bank AB in Vilnius.  The yield on  Lithuania ’s 2022 dollar bond fell 0.1
percentage point today to 4.8 percent, the lowest on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
