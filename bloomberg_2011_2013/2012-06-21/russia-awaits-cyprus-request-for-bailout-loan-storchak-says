Russia ’s government is ready to lend
Cyprus more money but the government in Nicosia hasn’t
officially submitted a request, Russian Deputy Finance Minister
Sergei Storchak said.  Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said June 19 in Nicosia
that the Cypriot government is pursuing a loan from Russia to
improve its bargaining position in case it has to turn to its
euro-area partners for emergency aid. The country may need as
much as 6 billion euros ($7.6 billion) to prop up its banks.  “Cyprus hasn’t applied yet, there are no official
papers,” Storchak told reporters on an airplane flying back
from Los Cabos,  Mexico , where he was part of President  Vladimir Putin ’s delegation at a Group of 20 meeting. Russia loaned
Cyprus 2.5 billion euros last year, Storchak said.  Cyprus, which joined the EU in 2004, would be the fifth
euro nation to seek a bailout, buffeted by the single-currency
bloc’s debt crisis, now in its third year. More than 386 billion
euros in loans have been pledged to  Greece , Ireland and
 Portugal . On June 9, Spain requested as much as 100 billion
euros to support its banks. Cyprus has been shut out of markets
for more than a year.  The Cypriot newspaper Alithia reported on June 12 that
Cyprus was asking Russia for 5 billion euros. The Politis daily
said three days later that Cypriot President Demetris Christofias was leading the loan talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
