Bolivian President  Evo Morales  said
environmentalism is a “predatory” tool by developed countries
to privatise nature.  “Environmentalism is an imperial strategy which quantifies
every river, every lake and every natural product and converts
it into money,” Morales said in a speech today at the United
Nations Rio+20 conference in Rio de Janeiro. “By measuring the
utility of nature in money, it colonizes nature. The
environmentalism of capitalism is predatory colonialism.”  The Rio+20 conference has gathered 50,000 delegates from
190 nations, including 130 world leaders, to chart a path to
eradicate poverty without degrading natural resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
