The  New York Jets  cut ticket prices
on about 12,000 seats in the top level of the National Football
League team’s MetLife Stadium in  East Rutherford ,  New Jersey .  Neil Glat, the team’s president, said the price of some
seats, primarily in the last 13 rows of end zones and corners,
will fall to $75 and $50 from $105 or $95.  “We took a hard look at the 300 level and it just made
sense to adjust pricing to improve the value for fans,” Glat
said in a telephone interview. “The games were never at risk of
not being on TV, but we really wanted to sell more tickets to
season-ticket holders.”  NFL rules impose a local television blackout for games not
sold out in advance. MetLife Stadium has a capacity of about
83,000.  Increasing season-ticket sales helps create communities for
fans and consistency for the team, Glat said. Existing ticket
holders will also receive the price break.  “From a business standpoint, you have a stable base, and
from a fan standpoint, you have continuity,” Glat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
