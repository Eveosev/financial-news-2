The start of  Europe ’s permanent
bailout fund may be delayed next month after Germany’s
 Constitutional Court  asked the president to withhold his
signature pending potential lawsuits challenging the law.  Germany’s  Federal Constitutional Court  asked President
Joachim Gauck to hold back from signing the European Stability
Mechanism and the fiscal pact into law to allow sufficient time
to examine potential lawsuits, Gauck’s office said today in e-
mailed statement, adding that the president will honor the
request.  The court will probably ask Gauck to wait a “few days”
before signing the ratification of the ESM, which is scheduled
to be approved by both houses of parliament on June 29 along
with the European fiscal pact, court spokeswoman Judith Blohm
said today. The European Union has been planning for the ESM to
start operating on July 9.  The request is normal procedure to allow the court to rule
on a potential emergency action seeking to block the law, Blohm
said in an interview from the western city of Karlsruhe. Groups
including  Germany ’s Left Party -- the former East German
communists -- which wants to stop the fiscal pact, have said
they’ll challenge the legislation.  The 500 billion-euro ($629 billion) ESM, designed to bail
out indebted euro-area member states beginning this year, will
replace the temporary 440 billion-euro European Financial
Stability Facility, which was set up in May 2010 to fight the
bloc’s debt crisis.  Because the EFSF still has unused funds, a delay for the
ESM won’t deny European leaders a backstop tool.  To contact the reporters on this story:
