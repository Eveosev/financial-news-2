Latin American must resist the urge
to boost economic growth as the euro area sovereign-debt crisis
probably will create less damage in the developing region than
many think, an International Monetary Fund director said today.  “My strong vision is that the spillover or potential
effect of  Europe ´s deterioration on the  United States , China and
 Latin America  has been greatly exaggerated,” said Nicolas Eyzaguirre, director of the IMF´s Western Hemisphere division.
“Don´t jump the gun. This is the time to build up defenses” in
Latin America, he said.  Latin America´s macroeconomic health is “impeccable” as
the region will grow 3.7 percent this year, exceeding the global
average of 3.5 percent, he said, citing forecasts published in
April by the Washington-based lender.  While the price of commodities such as copper have
declined, they will remain high from a historic perspective and
benefit Latin American exporters including  Chile , said
Eyzaguirre, who was finance minister for the Andean nation.
Latin America will continue to attract foreign investment as
liquidity remains elevated in other parts of the world, he said.  “The task of Latin American governments today, in light of
this great external bonanza, is to make structural reforms, not
pro-cyclical policies,” Eyzaguirre said. “There already is
enough pro-cyclicality with terms of trade.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
