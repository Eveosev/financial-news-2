The  European Central Bank  will relax
some rules on the collateral that banks can offer in exchange
for ECB funds, said a central bank official.  The Frankfurt-based central bankâ€™s Governing Council
decided yesterday to lower the minimum rating threshold for
mortgage-backed securities to BBB- from A-, said the official,
who declined to be identified because the discussions were
private. Spanish banks have been unable to use some securities
as collateral because the rating is too low, the person said.  Spanish institutions would need as much as 62 billion euros
($78 billion) in capital to withstand a worst-case economic
scenario, two consulting firms hired by the government to
conduct stress tests on the lenders said today. Economy Minister
Luis de Guindos has said  Spain  will use the results of the
studies to determine how much money it might need to draw from
the 100 billion euros made available by  Europe  after it
requested funding to clean up banks.  An ECB spokesman declined to comment. Financial Times
Deutschland reported the ECB decision earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
