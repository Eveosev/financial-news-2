Singapore ’s Foreign Affairs Ministry
suspended its Chief of Protocol Lim Cheng Hoe over allegations
of improper claims for expenses incurred during overseas trips.  “Lim has served MFA and Singapore very well for 38 years,
and we are very sad that this has happened,” the ministry said
in an e-mailed statement today. “MFA takes all allegations of
improper conduct seriously.”  Lim, who’s being investigated by the Commercial Affairs
Department, was removed from duties on June 19 after the
ministry received information about him, according to the
statement. He didn’t respond to phone calls at his office and
home, and didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  The ministry is reviewing its expense claims approval
process “to see what additional safeguards may be necessary,”
it said in a separate e-mailed statement.  The suspension comes after former Singapore Central
Narcotics Bureau director Ng Boon Gay and former Civil Defence
Force chief Peter Benedict Lim Sin Pang were charged this month
with corruption for obtaining sexual favors.  Singapore, which is ranked the fifth-least corrupt nation
by  Transparency International , is reviewing its public sector
financial procedures after a S$12.5 million ($9.8 million) fraud
in September 2010 by two former land authority workers.  “MFA expects its officers to uphold the highest standards
of duty, integrity and professionalism,” the foreign affairs
ministry said in the statement today. “No one can be exempt and
the law must take its course.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
