Celebrities joined advocacy group
Greenpeace International in seeking a ban on oil drilling and
excessive fishing in Arctic waters that would scuttle plans by
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and its Russian state-run rival OAO Rosneft to
extract petroleum there.  Paul McCartney , boy band One Direction and entrepreneur
Richard Branson are among those named on a scroll calling for
the ban, Amsterdam-based Greenpeace said today during a press
conference at the UN’s Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable
Development.  Exxon, Rosneft and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are among
companies seeking to drill for oil in the Arctic, which is
estimated to hold 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas, according to the  U.S. Geological
Survey .  “It seems madness that we are willing to go to the ends of
the Earth to find the last drops of oil when our best scientific
minds are telling us we need to get off fossil fuels,”
McCartney in a statement. “We need to take a stand.”  Greenpeace intends to collect 1 million names for the
scroll, which will be planted on the seabed four kilometers (2.5
miles) below the ice at the  North Pole .  Greenpeace activists occupied a Shell icebreaker in Finland
in May to protest the company’s plans to drill for oil off the
Alaska north coast. The company won U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service
authorization to disrupt animal habitats in the region this
month, moving it closer to starting drilling in the area this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
