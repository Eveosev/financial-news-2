Japan ’s parliament approved the
government’s nominees to the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s board, confirming
two economists who have signaled support for monetary stimulus.
The two could join the board as soon as next month’s policy
meeting.  Takahide Kiuchi of Nomura Securities Co. and Takehiro Sato
of Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. were approved by the
government-dominated lower house today after the upper chamber
voted in favor of them yesterday. Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s picks will take the places of two businessmen, breaking
the practice of replacing members with candidates from similar
backgrounds.  The opposition-controlled upper house blocked BNP Paribas
SA economist  Ryutaro Kono ’s nomination in April after some
lawmakers said he wasn’t a strong enough advocate of stimulus.
Today’s vote may encourage politicians who are pressing the
central bank to boost its 40 trillion yen ($503 billion) asset-
purchase program to spur growth and end deflation.  Sato wrote in a May 15 report that “the prevailing
political climate makes an end to easing unlikely” and said in
an interview last month that the BOJ’s inflation forecast for
next year was “wishful thinking.” Kiuchi has said that the
bank may need to cut growth and price forecasts.  Board member Koji Ishida said today that the bank will
continue to conduct powerful monetary easing to achieve its 1
percent inflation target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
