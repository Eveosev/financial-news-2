Kenya ’s shilling snapped a six-day
rally as businesses sought to acquire dollars following the
gains.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 83.84 per dollar and was trading 0.2
percent weaker at 83.80 by 1:03 p.m. in the capital Nairobi.  “The weakening of the shilling is due to a ramp up of
accumulation by businesses of dollars as they take advantage of
the recent gains,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based
Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
“With month-end demand expected to pick up, the shilling is
expected to come under pressure.”  The Kenya shilling gained 2.2 percent in the six days
through yesterday, closing at 83.60 per dollar, the highest in
more than five weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank did not offer repurchase agreements and
term-auction deposits for the second day today, a central bank
official who asked not to be named in line with policy said. The
bank reintroduced term-auction deposits as a “liquidity
management” measure on June 5.  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.4 percent to 2,475 per dollar,
while Tanzania’s currency appreciated by 0.1 percent to 1,580
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
