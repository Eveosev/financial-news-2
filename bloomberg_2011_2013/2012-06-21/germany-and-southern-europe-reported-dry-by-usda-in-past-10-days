Germany  and most of southern Europe
were drier than normal in the past 10 days, while the south of
the U.K. and northern France received more rain than usual, U.S.
Department of Agriculture satellite data showed.  Most of Spain, Italy, Bulgaria and Romania, as well as
parts of northern Germany and Poland received less than 50
percent of normal rainfall from June 11 to June 20, the data
 show . Parts of northern France and  England  got more than twice
the usual quantity of rain.  Rainfall across Germany’s wheat-growing areas has been
below normal since March 1, according to the data. Dry weather
may hurt this year’s grain harvest, adding to freezing damage to
the winter-grain area, farm lobby Deutscher Bauernverband wrote
in a June 4 report.  For  France , the European Union’s biggest wheat grower,
precipitation since March has been in line with long-term
average values for all main growing areas, including Centre and
Picardie, which jointly grow about 25 percent of the country’s
soft-wheat crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
