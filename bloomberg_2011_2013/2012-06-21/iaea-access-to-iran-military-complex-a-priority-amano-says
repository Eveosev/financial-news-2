Iran  granting access to its military
complex of Parchin remains a “matter of priority” for nuclear
inspectors, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General
Yukiya Amano said.  “Satellite imagery indicates that they are undertaking
quite important activities” at Parchin, Amano told reporters in
Budapest today after meeting Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi. “
In the past we did not see such active activities.”  Western powers contend Iran is hiding a nuclear-weapons
program, and the U.S. and  Israel  have declined to rule out the
possibility of military strikes against atomic installations.
Iran insists its nuclear work is peaceful.  The IAEA has said Iran has failed to provide “credible
assurances” about the absence of undeclared nuclear material
and activities -- necessary to conclude its program is
exclusively peaceful. In November, the Vienna-based United
Nations organization reported that Parchin may have been the
site of experiments on a trigger for a nuclear weapon.  Iran and world powers failed to reach a breakthrough in the
nuclear row during two days of talks in Moscow that ended
yesterday. A central issue in the negotiations is whether Iran
will stop producing 20 percent enriched uranium, a level of
purity a step short of bomb grade, and move current stockpiles
out of the country to show that it isn’t seeking the capability
to produce nuclear weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
