Manny Pacquiao beat Timothy Bradley
according to a five-person World Boxing Organization panel that
reviewed the welterweight fight, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The original decision in Bradley’s favor after the June 9
bout will stand, the Nevada State Athletic Commission said,
according to the Telegraph.  Pacquiao, 33, an eight-time world boxing champion, suffered
his first defeat in seven years when two of three judges scored
the WBO contest in favor of Bradley. The decision prompted jeers
from the crowd at the MGM Grand in  Las Vegas  and led Irish
bookmaker Paddy Power to refund bets on the Filipino fighter.  The WBO’s championship committee examined video of the
fight with five judges, who all scored in favor of Pacquiao, the
paper said. The WBO doesn’t have the power to overturn the
decision, it said.  Pacquiao landed 253 total punches to undefeated Bradley’s
159 and connected with 190 power punches to Bradley’s 108.  To contact the reporter on this story:
