What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that the
highest U.S. cash  prices  in a month will slow demand for the
grain used to make ethanol and livestock feed, Jason Roose, the
vice president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines,
Iowa, said in a telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as the dollarâ€™s rally erodes the appeal of U.S.
exports, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel higher in
Chicago on speculation that demand will increase after drought
cut production in South America this year and dry weather
threatens U.S. crops, Roose said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
