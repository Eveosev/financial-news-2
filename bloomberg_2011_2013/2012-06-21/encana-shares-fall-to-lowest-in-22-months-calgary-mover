Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s biggest
natural-gas producer, fell the most in 18 months after it said
it will increase spending this year and doesn’t intend to
further curtail production amid low prices for the furnace fuel.  The shares fell 7.9 percent to C$20.39 at the close in
Toronto, the most since Dec. 1, 2008.  Encana will invest an additional $600 million this year to
boost production of higher priced petroleum liquids to help
offset declining cash flow from gas production, Randy Eresman,
chief executive officer of the Calgary-based company, said in a
webcast presentation to analysts today.  Gas prices  in  New York 
fell to their lowest in 10 years in April.  The company is sticking with plans to cut back gas
production by 250 million cubic feet a day this year and will
increase production next year, Eric Marsh, an Encana vice
president, said in an e-mail. The company expects prices to rise
to about $4 per British thermal units by the end of this year.  “There were no real positive surprises,” Phil Skolnick,
an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc. in Toronto, said in a note
to investors today.  Encana will probably spend more than its  cash flow  next
year and is counting on joint ventures to contribute as much as
$1.5 billion and compensate for the cash-flow decline, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
