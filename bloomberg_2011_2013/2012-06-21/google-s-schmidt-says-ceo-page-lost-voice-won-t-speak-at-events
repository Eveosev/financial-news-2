Google Inc. (GOOG)  Executive Chairman  Eric Schmidt  said Chief Executive Officer  Larry Page  has lost his
voice and won’t be speaking at three company events, which
included the shareholders’ meeting today.  Because of his voice condition, Page won’t speak at the
company’s annual developers conference next week, Schmidt said
at the meeting in Mountain View, California. Page also won’t be
able to talk on the call with analysts when Google, owner of the
most popular Internet search engine, makes its second-quarter
earnings announcement.  At the meeting, shareholders approved a proposal, announced
in April, that lets the company issue new shares without
diluting the voting power of Schmidt, Page and his fellow co-
founder Sergey Brin. The stock change would create a new class
of nonvoting shares that will be distributed to existing
shareholders in what is effectively a 2-for-1 stock split.  While the proposal was subject to a vote, it was expected
to pass because Page, Brin and Schmidt control the majority of
voting power,  David Drummond , Google’s chief legal officer, said
in an April statement.  Still, pending litigation against the new structure is
likely to hold up the proposal’s implementation, and probably
won’t be resolved before the fourth quarter, Don Harrison, vice
president and deputy general counsel, said today at the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
