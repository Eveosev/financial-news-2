Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the operator
of membership warehouses for  consumer goods , is looking into
opening stores in continental  Europe , said James P. Murphy,
international executive vice president.  “We are interested in investing in the obvious four --
Germany, Italy, France and Spain,” Murphy said in an interview
at a consumer goods forum in Istanbul today. The company hasn’t
decided which country may be first and will probably open a
store in the region “in the next couple of years,” he said.  The retailer is “seeing some reductions in expensive real
estate” in Europe, Murphy said. Weakened demand and austerity
measures are a concern there, he said.  Costco, which is adding more pharmacies and vision centers
to lure customers to its stores, this month said it would buy
out the partner in its Mexican joint venture for 10.65 billion
pesos ($765 million.) The retailer would gain a 50 percent stake
in Costco de Mexico and the power to expand in the nation, where
it has 32 stores and unit growth has stagnated.  Costco is also considering opening stores in  Turkey , Murphy
said.  “It’s a fabulous market with great potential,” he said.
“We’re prioritizing markets, but it’s not in the top 10.”  Costco  fell  1.2 percent to $90.40 at the close in New York.
The Issaquah, Washington-based company has gained 8.5 percent
this year.  Costco operates more than 600 warehouses worldwide,
including about 435 in the U.S. and  Puerto Rico , and 22 in the
U.K.  To contact the reporters on this story:
