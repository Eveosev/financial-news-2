The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars fell for the third day, according to a money-
markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 50 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 2 p.m. in
London, from minus 51 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the cheapest level since June 15.  The one-year basis swap was 50 basis points below Euribor
from minus 49 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for loans
over that period in euros, fell to 0.655 percent from 0.657 the
day before. The rate has fallen since June 14 toward the record
low of 0.634 percent reached on March 31, 2010.  One-week Euribor rose to 0.325 percent from 0.322 percent.
Euribor is derived from a survey of panel banks and published at
around 9 a.m. daily by the European Banking Federation.  Prices in the forward market for three-month Euribor
relative to a gauge of overnight borrowing costs or overnight
indexed swaps -- known as the  FRA/OIS spread  -- were 30 basis
points from 31.5 yesterday.  The Euribor/OIS spread was little changed at 43 basis
points .  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-
based  European Central Bank  yesterday, placing 780 billion euros
($989 billion) from 764 billion euros the day before.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged for the twelfth day at 0.468
percent. Libor, which acts as a benchmark for about $360
trillion of financial instruments worldwide, is published by the
British Bankers’ Association.  Three-month Euribor USD, a gauge of dollar funding costs
from the Brussels-based EBF, was unchanged at 0.948 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
