Mexico ’s Navy captured a man
suspected of being the son of the country’s most wanted drug
lord, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, authorities said.  Jesus Alfredo Guzman Salazar was detained this morning in
the Pacific Coast state of Jalisco, the Navy said in a
statement.  Joaquin Guzman, who heads the Sinaloa Cartel, escaped from
a federal prison in a laundry truck in 2001. More than 47,000
people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican
President  Felipe Calderon  took office in 2006 and deployed
troops to fight drug cartels in some parts of the country. He
steps down Dec. 1 following presidential elections July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
