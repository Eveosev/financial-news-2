Spain  paid the most in at least
eight years to sell three-year debt ahead of the publication of
its banks’ capital needs that will determine how much the euro
area’s fourth-largest economy needs from European rescue funds.  The Treasury today sold 2.22 billion euros ($2.81 billion)
of bonds, the Madrid-based Bank of Spain said today. That’s
above a 2 billion-euro maximum target for the sale. Three-year
bonds maturing in July 2015 fetched an average rate of 5.547
percent, compared with 4.876 percent on May 17, and the most
since at least 2004.  Spain, which became the  fourth euro member  to seek a
bailout on June 9, will specify today how much it needs of the
100 billion-euro  credit line  it has been granted to shore up
banks burdened with bad loans while tackling a  budget deficit  as
large as that of  Greece  amid a  recession . Spanish bonds rose
after  European Central Bank  Executive Board member Benoit Coeure
told the Financial Times that an interest-rate cut will probably
be discussed at policy makers’ July 5 meeting.  The yield on  Spain’s 10-year benchmark  bond fell 3 basis
points to 6.66 percent after the auction at 9:58 a.m. in  London .
That compares with a euro era high of 7.285 percent on June 18,
a surge that has prompted Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s
government to call on the European Central Bank to prop up the
nation’s bond market.  Italy, Spain  A bond maturing in April 2014 was sold to yield 4.706
percent, up from 2.069 percent on March 1. The yield was 6.072
percent for securities maturing in July 2017, up from 4.96 on
May 3. Demand for the July 2015 and April 2014 securities rose
to 3.18 and 3.97 respectively times the amount sold, compared
with 3.01 and 2.81 at the last auctions. It was 3.44 times for
the five-year bonds, compared with 3.14 in May.  Italy and Spain, which account for more than a quarter of
the euro-area economy, are heading for sovereign bailouts in the
next 12 months that will send shockwaves through the global
economy, Jamie Stuttard,  Fidelity Investments ’ head of
international bond portfolio management in London, said in a
telephone interview on June 19.  Both nations may stumble over debt auctions in the next
year, forcing European authorities to find official funding for
them to hold the single-currency area together, he said.  Spain’s debt agency said on June 19 that it has sold 58.8
percent of the 86 billion euros of medium- and long-term debt it
plans to issue this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
