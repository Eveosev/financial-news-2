Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
slumped 1.9 percent to 4,031.6 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo,
the lowest level in almost five months. That brought the gauge’s
drop to 8.8 percent this week, the most since March 2011.  The following shares were active on the Egyptian Exchange.
Stock symbols follow company names.  Ezz Steel (ESRS)   declined 1.6 percent to 5.58 Egyptian
pounds, the lowest level since January. The Arab country’s
biggest steel manufacturer retreated for a fourth day after New
York-based EVA Dimensions LLC  reduced it  to underweight from
hold.  Maridive & Oil Services SAE (MOIL EY), an offshore services
company, retreated 1 percent to 99 cents, the lowest close since
the shares were listed in 2007. Oil futures tumbled as much as
2.3 percent to $79.92 a barrel in  New York , the first time the
contracts have fallen below $80 in eight months, as U.S.
inventories surged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
