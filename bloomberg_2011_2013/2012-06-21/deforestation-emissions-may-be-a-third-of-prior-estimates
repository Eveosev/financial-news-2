The  carbon emissions  from cutting
down tropical forests may be about one third of the level
previously estimated, according to an article in the journal
 Science .  A team of nine scientists used satellite-imagery data to
better measure the effects of global deforestation between 2000
and 2005, said Nancy Harris, lead author of the article. Brazil
and  Indonesia  produced 55 percent of the total emissions,
according to the article published today.  “Deforestation is still a very large and significant
problem,” Harris, a carbon and land-use specialist at  Little
Rock , Arkansas-based environmental group  Winrock International ,
said in a telephone interview yesterday. “Just because our
numbers are lower does not necessarily mean that deforestation
is not as bad.”  Cutting down tropical forests accounted for 10 percent of
man-made carbon emissions, according to the results tabulated by
the team, which included research from the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Policy makers, farmers, forestry experts and scientists all
will need to work together to reduce worldwide carbon emissions
“and the forest plays a critical role in that,” Harris said.  “Regardless of what scale these policy strategies happen
at -- project scale, national scale, state levels -- we now have
the ability to monitor what happens, so we can evaluate whether
policies are actually making a difference,” Harris said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
