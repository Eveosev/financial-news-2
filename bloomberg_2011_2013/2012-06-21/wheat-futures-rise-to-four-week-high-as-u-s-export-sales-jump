Wheat futures rose to a four-week
high after exports sales almost doubled from the U.S., the
world’s biggest shipper.  Net sales  surged to 842,000 metric tons in the week ended
June 14 from 432,871 tons a week earlier, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today.  Japan  purchased 143,500 tons, and China
bought 114,500 tons. Wheat climbed for the fourth straight day,
the longest rally in a month.  “Export sales being reported looked pretty good this
morning,” Jamey Kohake, a branch manager at Paragon Investments
in  Silver Lake , Kansas, said in a telephone interview. “We’re
getting a bounce off that.”  Wheat futures for September delivery gained 0.6 percent to
$6.8725 a bushel at 10:18 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $7, the highest for a most-active
contract since May 22.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
