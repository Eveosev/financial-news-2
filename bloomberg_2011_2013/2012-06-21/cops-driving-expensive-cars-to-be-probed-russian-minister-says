Russia ’s top cop said he plans to
investigate police officers who drive expensive cars for
possible corruption.  “This is a concern for us,” said Interior Minister
Vladimir Kolokoltsev, who was Moscow police chief before being
promoted by President  Vladimir Putin  last month. “There are
lots of problems, I’m not hiding that,” Kolokoltsev said at the
 St. Petersburg International Economic Forum  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
