Russia joining the  World Trade
Organization  means its steel exports are a threat to Europeâ€™s
steel industry, according to Karlheinz Blessing, the chief
executive officer of Dillinger Huette Saarstahl AG, the
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  Speaking at the Economic Press Club in Dusseldorf, Blessing
said Russian steelmakers have ample raw materials and produce at
lower cost than German companies, and imports could lead to
overcapacity in the market, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
