Dover Motorsports Inc. (DVD) , operator of
two racetracks that host events for the National Association for
Stock Car Auto Racing, declined the most in three weeks after
reporting a wider annual loss on lower revenue.  The company fell 4.6 percent, the biggest drop since Jan.
4, to close at $1.24. The shares have  retreated  33 percent in 12
months. The company’s market value at the close was $45.6
million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  While recording a profit for the fourth quarter, Dover
yesterday said its annual net loss widened to $9.2 million, or
25 cents a share in 2011, from $8.2 million, or 23 cents, in
2010. Revenue from admissions fell 17 percent to $13.6 million
for the year, while total revenue declined 5.4 percent to $51.9
million.  Dover said in a Jan. 24 statement that the New York Stock
Exchange had accepted a company plan for continued listing of
its shares. In November, the Dover, Delaware-based company had
said its average market capitalization over 30 days had fallen
below the $50 million minimum required for listing.  Along with the Dover International Speedway, known as the
Monster Mile, the company operates the Nashville Superspeedway
in  Tennessee . Dover annually hosts two Nascar Sprint Cut events
at the Dover track. The company has said it won’t seek to host
Nascar-sanctioned races at the Tennessee track this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
