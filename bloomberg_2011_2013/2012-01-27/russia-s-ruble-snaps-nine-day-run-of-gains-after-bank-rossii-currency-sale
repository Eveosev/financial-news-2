The ruble ended its longest winning
streak against the dollar since March 2008 amid speculation that
the central bank is buying foreign currencies to slow its
appreciation.  The Russian currency weakened 0.3 percent to 30.29 per
dollar and 0.1 percent to 34.5672 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket at the close in Moscow. An  exchange
rate  from 34.70 to 33.87 against the basket implies daily
interventions of as much as $150 million to weaken the ruble,
according to VTB Group’s estimates.  “After a 3 percent appreciation against the basket during
the last ten days we expect the ruble rally to slow down at this
stage and would recommend investors start taking profits out of
ruble long positions,” Nikolay Podguzov, head of fixed-income
strategy at VTB Capital in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients.  Bank Rossii buys and sells international currencies to
manage the ruble within a floating corridor and against a basket
of about 55 percent dollars and 45 percent euros. The corridor
is currently at 32.20 to 38.20, Vladimir Kolychev, head of
research at Societe Generale SA’s OAO Rosbank unit in Moscow,
said by e-mail yesterday.  The Russian currency climbed for nine consecutive sessions
against the dollar through Jan. 26 and appreciated 3.4 percent
against the basket.  Urals crude oil ,  Russia ’s chief export
earner, has risen 4 percent to $109.93 a barrel in 2012 on
expectations of supply disruptions in Iran and  Nigeria .  The ruble was little changed at 39.795 per euro today.
Investors increased bets the ruble would weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 30.6866 per
dollar in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
