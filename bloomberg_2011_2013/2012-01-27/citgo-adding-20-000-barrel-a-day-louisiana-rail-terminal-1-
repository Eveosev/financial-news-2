Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lake Charles
refinery in  Louisiana  is commissioning a rail terminal next
week, said Bob Kent, vice president of refining at the company.  The terminal will be able to accept 20,000 barrels a day of
oil or more, he said during a presentation at the Argus Americas
Crude Summit in Houston.  “We will probably start off buying it from people who have
loaded it onto rail cars,” he said. The company may also buy
crude “from people in the field and load it ourselves” in the
future, he said.  The Lake Charles refinery has a crude processing capacity
of 440,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
