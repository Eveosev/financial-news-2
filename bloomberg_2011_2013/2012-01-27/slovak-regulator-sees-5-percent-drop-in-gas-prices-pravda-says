Slovak natural-gas prices for
households will probably drop between 3 percent and 5 percent
from March,  Pravda  reported, citing the country’s utility
regulator.  The drop is driven by the lower price of the commodity paid
by the country’s dominant gas company, Slovensky Plynarensky
Priemysel AS, to its Russian supplier OAO Gazprom, the newspaper
said, citing Jozef Holjencik, the head of the Office for Network
Industries, the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
