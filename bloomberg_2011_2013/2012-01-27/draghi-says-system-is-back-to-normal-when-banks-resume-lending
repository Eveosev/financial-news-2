European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the system will return back to normal when
euro-region banks resume lending to each other.  “You have parts of the euro area where credit is more or
less normal but also parts where credit is seriously
contracted,” Draghi said at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland, today. “One key thing, we have to see a
reactivation of the interbank market, we have to see that banks
trust each other to the point where they go back to lending to
each other and don’t have to go through” the ECB.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
