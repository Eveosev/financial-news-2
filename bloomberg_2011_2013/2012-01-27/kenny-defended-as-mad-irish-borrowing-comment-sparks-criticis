Irish Enterprise Minister  Richard Bruton  defended Prime Minister  Enda Kenny , after opposition
lawmakers criticized his comment that “mad borrowing” by the
Irish people helped trigger the county’s economic collapse.  “What happened in our country was that people simply went
mad borrowing,” Kenny said in a panel discussion at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland  yesterday. “The extent of
personal wealth created on credit was done between people and
banks, a system that spawned greed to a point where this went
out of control completely with a spectacular crash.”  Kenny’s comments contrasted with a televised national
address he gave before the budget in December, when he said the
Irish people weren’t responsible for the crash. His latest
remarks dominated the front pages of the country’s newspapers
today and Niall Collins, a lawmaker with opposition party Fianna
Fail, said Kenny is “clearly taking one approach at home and
another abroad.”  Kenny “has made clear ordinary people are not to blame,”
for the country’s crash, Bruton said in an interview
with Dublin-based broadcaster RTE today. He is “entirely in
touch” with the people, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
