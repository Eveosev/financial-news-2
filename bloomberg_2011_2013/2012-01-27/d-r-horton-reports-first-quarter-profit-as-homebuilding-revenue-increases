D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI) , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by volume, reported a first-quarter profit that beat
analyst estimates after a year-earlier loss as revenue from home
sales rose.  Net income was $27.7 million, or 9 cents a share, for the
three months through Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $20.4
million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the  Fort Worth , Texas-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts expected earnings of
5 cents, the average of 17  estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  The company reported a profit for the fourth consecutive
quarter as it cut costs and boosted margins by selling more
houses on discounted land acquired after prices fell in 2009.
 D.R. Horton  managed to profit even as unemployment and mortgage
delinquencies stifled the housing market. About 302,000  new
homes  were sold in the U.S. in 2011, the worst year in records
dating to 1963, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.  “We believe new residential construction bottomed in 2011
and could see modest growth in 2012,” Adam Rudiger, an analyst
with  Wells Fargo & Co . in  San Francisco , wrote in a note to
investors today. He has an “outperform” rating on D.R. Horton
“because of the company’s excellent cost control, ability to
generate profits at depressed volume levels and focus on
affordability,” he said.  The builder rose 1.9 percent to $14.39 at the close in  New
York . The shares have increased 12 percent in the past 12
months, compared with a 2.3 percent loss for the 11-member
Standard & Poor’s 1500 Homebuilding  Index. (S15HOME)   ‘Cautiously Optimistic’  “Although macroeconomic and housing conditions remain
soft, we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder of 2012,”
Chief Executive Officer Donald Tomnitz said in a conference call
today. “We’re just focusing on probably the next 12 months
ahead when we say cautious because there are some elections
coming, there are a lot of issues on the table, and we don’t
know how those are going to impact the homebuilding business.”  D.R. Horton’s homebuilding revenue for the quarter was
$885.6 million, up from $767 million a year earlier.  Net home orders rose to 3,794 from 3,363 a year earlier.
The company’s backlog of houses under contract, another gauge of
future revenue, rose to 4,530 from 3,854.  The company has 5,700 “spec” homes built or under
construction on speculation that they will be available to meet
demand in the first half of the year, with closings expected to
increase in the second half, D.R. Horton Treasurer Stacey Dwyer
said during the conference call.  East Grows Most  The strongest growth was in its eastern and southeastern
areas of the country. In the east, the company had 509 net
orders in the fourth quarter, up from 400 in the last three
months of 2010. In the southeast, orders climbed to 921 from
769. Executives declined to say which markets they expect to be
their strongest this year.  NVR Inc. (NVR) , the fourth-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
said yesterday that net income decreased 45 percent while orders
rose 22 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The
company’s backlog climbed 26 percent.  Ryland Group Inc. (RYL) , a builder based in  Westlake Village ,
 California , reported net income of $812,000 million for the
three months through December, its first profitable quarter
since 2009, as closings increased 16 percent and new home orders
rose 24 percent from a year earlier, according to a statement
released after markets closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
