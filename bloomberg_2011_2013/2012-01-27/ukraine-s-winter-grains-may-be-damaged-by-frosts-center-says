Ukraine’s winter grain crop may be
damaged by frosts, with 30 percent to 35 percent of fields
lacking enough snow to survive freezing temperatures forecast
through Feb. 7, according to the national meteorology center.  Temperatures may fall to as low as minus 35 degrees Celsius
(minus 31 degrees Fahrenheit), Tetiana Adamenko, head of the
national weather center’s agro-meteorology department, said in a
phone interview in Kiev today.  “Two or three more days of increasing cold will make the
soil temperature critical for plants where snow pack is
insufficient,” Adamenko said. “It is hard to overestimate the
role of snow.”  Sprouting of Ukraine’s winter grains, mostly winter wheat,
declined and the condition of plants worsened after the worst
autumn drought in more than 50 years. Dry air and dry soil
didn’t allow winter grains on 1.3 million hectares (3.2 million
acres) to emerge by Dec. 19, according to the  Agriculture
Ministry ’s  website . The wheat crop will fall 46 percent this
year, the government says.  To contact the reporter on this story:
