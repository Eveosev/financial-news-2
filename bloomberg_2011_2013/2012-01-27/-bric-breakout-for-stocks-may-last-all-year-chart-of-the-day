Emerging-market stocks are
experiencing a “BRIC breakout” that’s likely to have staying
power throughout the year, according to Geoffrey Dennis, a
Citigroup Inc. strategist.  MSCI Inc.’s BRIC Index, tracking the shares of companies
based in  Brazil , Russia, India and China, rose 14 percent this
month through yesterday after falling in eight of the previous
nine months.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the BRIC gauge is beating
MSCI’s emerging-market index in January after trailing for all
of 2010 and 2011. The back-to-back defeats were the first since
2002. The chart depicts the ratio between the two indexes.  “We expect the BRIC outperformance to continue over the
course of 2012,” Dennis wrote two days ago in a report. He
cited declining inflation and  interest rates  in developing
countries, money flows into emerging-market stock funds, and
historically low share prices. The MSCI BRIC Index was valued
yesterday at 9.4 times earnings, less than half its ratio two
years ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China  is the best choice among the four countries,
according to Dennis, who is based in  New York  and focuses on
emerging markets. Stocks are poised to climb, in his view, as
the government seeks to bolster investor confidence and adds
funds to the financial system.  Brazil, Russia and India follow in that order, Dennis
wrote. The Brazilian economy has to overcome relatively high
interest rates, the report said, while Russia faces political
protests and India’s economic expansion may lack momentum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
