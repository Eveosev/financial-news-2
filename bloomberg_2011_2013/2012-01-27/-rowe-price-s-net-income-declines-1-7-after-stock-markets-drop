T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) , the asset
manager that has posted a profit every quarter since going
public in 1986, said quarterly earnings fell for the first time
in more than two years after stock markets declined.  Net income decreased 1.7 percent to $188.4 million, or 73
cents a share, from $191.6 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier,
the Baltimore-based company said today in a statement. Earnings
per share increased as the number of outstanding shares fell 2.7
percent. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 69 cents a share.  “They are still seeing a lot of growth from retirement
accounts, but they are not immune to the broader derisking
trend,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill & Partners
LP in New York, said in a telephone interview before results
were announced.  T. Rowe Price, under Chief Executive Officer James Kennedy,
had reported eight straight quarters of year-over-year profit
growth driven in part by the popularity of its retirement-
oriented products. Equity markets declined in 2011, curbing
asset growth at the company. T. Rowe Price has about three-
fourths of assets invested in equities.  Global stocks, as measured by the MSCI AC World Index, fell
9.4 percent in 2011 and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S.
stocks was almost unchanged.  Increased Assets  T. Rowe Price dropped 2 percent to close at $59.82 in  New
York  trading. The shares have fallen 12 percent in the past
year, compared with the 19 percent decline of Standard & Poor’s
20-company index of asset managers and custody banks.  The amount of money T. Rowe Price invests for clients rose
1.6 percent to $490 billion as of Dec. 31, boosted by $1.1
billion in deposits in the fourth quarter and $14.1 billion in
2011, including $8 billion to target-date retirement funds.
Market depreciation reduced assets by $6.6 billion from a year
earlier.  “Performance continues to be good,” Kennedy said in a
telephone interview. “The market had a negative impact, but
because of the performance clients trusted us with another $14
billion.”  The higher assets helped increase revenue 3.7 percent to
$672 million, outpacing the growth of expenses, which climbed
3.6 percent to $378 million. Compensation, the largest expense
item, rose 1.4 percent.  ‘Very Cautious’  Kennedy said the company was “very cautious” with
expenses in 2011 and took advantage of the firm’s falling stock
price in much of 2011 by spending $480 million to repurchase 8.7
million shares.  T. Rowe Price’s mutual funds attracted $2.2 billion in the
quarter, including $1.9 billion into bond funds. Institutional
clients withdrew $1.1 billion as their redemptions from stock
and balanced investments surpassed deposits to fixed-income
products.  A higher  tax rate  also eroded net income compared to a year
earlier, as the company’s provision for income taxes rose to 39
percent of pretax income from 36 percent.  T. Rowe Price’s net income last declined in the third
quarter of 2009, a year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. helped trigger a six-month plunge in stocks.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s largest money manager, said
Jan. 19 that fourth-quarter net income fell 16 percent to $555
million, and the firm cut 3.4 percent of its workforce. Denver-
based  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS)  yesterday said fourth-quarter net
income declined 46 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
