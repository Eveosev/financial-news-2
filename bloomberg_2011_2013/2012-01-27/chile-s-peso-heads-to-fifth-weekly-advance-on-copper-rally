Chile’s peso rose, extending its
fifth consecutive weekly gain, after the country’s biggest
export, copper, touched its highest price in four months.  The currency strengthened 0.4 percent to 484.55 per  U.S.
dollar , bringing its increase this week to 1.6 percent. The peso
closed below 485 for the first time since September. The
Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index  gained  0.3
percent today and is up 1.2 percent this week.  Copper for March delivery rose as much as 1 percent today
in  New York  to $3.939 a pound, the highest since Sept. 20,
before reversing course and sliding 0.4 percent after Commerce
Department data showed the  U.S. economy  grew less than analysts
forecast in the fourth quarter.  “The trend is for asset prices to rise and the
appreciative pressure on the peso will continue,” said Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa. “Any stumble in the market is just an opportunity to
sell dollars, as you can see today. The main reason for the
peso’s gain has been the sharp rise in copper, but it will take
a series of negative events for the trend to change.”  Chile is the world’s biggest producer of copper and the
metal, used in cars and homes, accounts for half its exports.
Copper’s decline today reduced its weekly gain to 3.8 percent.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced their short position in the currency to $4.2 billion on
Jan. 25, the lowest since Nov. 3 according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
