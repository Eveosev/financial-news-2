Facebook Inc.’s planned initial
public offering is an “inevitability” as there are a lot of
shareholders in the company that want “liquidity and access to
the public market,”  Sean Parker  said today in an interview with
Bloomberg TV at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland.  Parker also said that the technology industry in Silicon
Valley is realizing it has political power and is taking
advantage of it, as shown with the blackout of Web sites such as
Wikipedia.org to protest proposed U.S. anti-piracy legislation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
