Former European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said today that in “a world of
market economies” officials should address the probability of a
bank collapse.  “We should reduce the the probability of having
consequences that are very adverse,” he said at a Bloomberg
conference in Davos,  Switzerland . “Nobody would be foolish
enough” to say that everything is safe, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
