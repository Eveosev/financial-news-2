Poland’s economy expanded at the
quickest pace in three years in 2011 as companies boosted
investment and a weakening zloty buoyed exports.  Gross domestic product  rose 4.3 percent from a year
earlier, compared with a revised 3.9 percent in 2010, the
 Central Statistical Office  in Warsaw said today. The median
estimate of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 4.2 percent.
The annual pace was the fastest since the economy grew 5.1
percent in 2008.  Poland’s economy, the largest of the European Union’s
eastern states, was the only one in the 27-nation bloc to avoid
a recession in 2009. EU funds helped improve infrastructure and
modernize production, while the weaker zloty kept exports
growing as the euro area’s debt crisis damped demand on the
country’s most important markets, including  Germany .  “This is a very good result,” Anna Zielinska-Glebocka of
the central bank’s Monetary Policy Council said in an interview
on TVN CNBC after the 2011 GDP estimate was released. “Let’s
hope the performance can be sustained this year.”  The zloty dropped 11.2 percent against the euro last year,
the fifth-worst performance among more than 20 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency traded at 4.2220
per euro at 10:14 a.m. in Warsaw, up 0.2 percent on the day.  Poland should be able to maintain economic growth at better
than a 3 percent pace this year, Zielinska-Glebocka said.  Investments Quicken  Fixed-investment growth accelerated to 8.7 percent in 2011
from a 0.2 percent decline a year earlier, while private-
consumption growth slowed to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent, the
statistical office said.  “Consumption has weakened for households and corporates,
but investment has recovered pretty strongly,”  Raffaella Tenconi , an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
 London , said in a Jan. 20 interview. “This seems partly to be
because the public sector wanted to be forward looking and
anticipated a fiscal crisis that in the event never happened.
Also, the German economy is doing better than we expected.”  Exports rose 13 percent to 12.5 billion euros ($16.4
billion) in November from a year earlier, according to the
latest foreign trade figures from the statistical office.  To contact the reporters on this story:
