James Murdoch, the deputy chief
operating officer of  News Corp. (NWSA) , should quit the board of
Sotheby, said CtW Investment Group, an adviser to union-
sponsored pension funds with more than $200 billion in assets.  GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.’s largest drugmaker, said
earlier today that Murdoch won’t seek re-election to the
board of directors this year.  The phone-hacking scandal that engulfed News Corp.’s U.K.
unit makes Murdoch “ill-suited for service on the boards of
GSK,  Sotheby’s (BID)  and  BSkyB (BSY) ,” CtW said in an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
