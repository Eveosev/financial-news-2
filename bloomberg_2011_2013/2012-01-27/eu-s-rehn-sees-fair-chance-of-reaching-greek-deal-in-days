European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said he sees a “fair chance” of
reaching an agreement on a Greek public-sector involvement in
the coming days.  “We have a fair chance of striking a deal in the coming
days,” Rehn told reporters at the  World Economic Forum  in
Davos,  Switzerland , today. “If not today, then maybe over the
weekend or in any case preferably in January.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
