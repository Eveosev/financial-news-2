Marina Bay Sands Pte, the  Singapore 
unit of  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , is considering borrowing about
S$4.6 billion ($3.7 billion) to refinance loans, said three
people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified
as the details are private.  Marina Bay Sands has S$5.4 billion in loans that mature in
2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Marina Bay Sands
in Singapore couldn’t comment immediately.  The  U.S. casino company  controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson  reported third-quarter profit in October that beat
analysts’ estimates, spurred by growth in both Singapore and
Macau. Cash flow at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore was a record
$413.9 million in the quarter.  Singapore has authorized just two casinos, which Las Vegas
Sands and Malaysian rival Genting Bhd. opened in the first half
of 2010. International visitor arrivals to the Southeast Asian
city-state rose 15 percent from a year earlier to about 3.5
million in the third quarter, according to the Singapore Tourism
Board.  To contact the reporters on this story:
