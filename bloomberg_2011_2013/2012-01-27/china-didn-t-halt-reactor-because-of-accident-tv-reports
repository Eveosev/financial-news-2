China  didn’t halt its first
experimental fast reactor in Beijing last year because of an
accident, Wan Gang, head of China Institute of Atomic Energy,
said in a  China Network Television  broadcast today.  China stopped operations at the reactor in July after the
project completed a power-generation trial and passed
authorities’ tests, Wan said. Japanese media reports saying that
an accident took place in the reactor’s turbine building last
year are “out of nothing,” he said.  The fourth-generation reactor is monitored by operators 24
hours a day and the government plans to restart it in the second
quarter, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
