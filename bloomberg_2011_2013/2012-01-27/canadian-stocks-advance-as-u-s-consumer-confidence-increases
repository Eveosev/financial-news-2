Canadian stocks  rose, extending a
sixth-straight weekly advance, after borrowing costs fell at an
Italian debt sale and the  U.S. dollar  declined for a fifth day
against the euro.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer,
gained 1.1 percent as the metal climbed to a seven-week high.
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s second-biggest lender by assets,
dropped 0.9 percent as financial stocks declined for a fourth
day. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, rallied 3.4 percent after
an analyst at  National Bank of Canada (NA)  boosted his  rating  on the
shares.  The  S&P/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  gained 2.18 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 12,466.50, extending its weekly advance to
0.6 percent.  “The euro has come under so much pressure in the past few
months, and indications out of  Europe  have turned a little more
constructive,”  Andrew Pyle , an associate portfolio manager at
Bank of  Nova Scotia  in Peterborough, Ontario, said in a
telephone interview. Pyle’s team oversees about C$200 million
($200 million). “Maybe the euro has found a bottom against the
U.S. dollar, and that would help support gold.”  The index’s streak of weekly gains is the longest since
April 2009. Gold stocks rallied this week after the U.S. Federal
Reserve said it plans to keep  interest rates  at historical lows
until at least late 2014 and the U.S. dollar retreated. Raw-
materials companies make up 21 percent of Canadian equities by
market value, according to Bloomberg data.  Italian Debt Sale  Italy’s Treasury sold 8 billion euros ($10.5 billion) of
182-day bills today at the lowest yields since May. It also sold
3 billion euros of 331-day bills. The U.S. dollar fell for a
fifth day against the euro.  The  S&P/TSX Gold Index (STGOLD)  completed its biggest weekly rally
since October. Barrick Gold Corp., the world’s largest producer
of the metal, increased 1.1 percent to C$49.51.  Eldorado Gold
Corp. (ELD) , Canada’s fifth-biggest company in the industry by market
value, climbed 6.5 percent to C$15.07.  Premier Gold Mines Ltd. (PG) , which said yesterday it intends to
enter a joint venture with Newmont Mining Corp. in  Nevada ,
jumped 12 percent to C$5.95. Christos Doulis, an analyst at
Stonecap Securities Inc., raised his 12-month price estimate on
the shares to C$8.85 from C$8.50, citing the joint venture in a
note to clients.  Potash Corp. Upgrade  Potash Corp. gained 3.4 percent to C$47.54 after Robert B. Winslow, an analyst at National Bank, boosted his rating on the
shares to “sector perform” from “underperform.” Winslow
raised his earnings estimates for the company, citing “the
potential for near-term upward pressure on grain prices” in a
note to clients.  Financial stocks in the S&P/TSX fell after the U.S. said
its gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of
2.8 percent in the fourth quarter. Economists had forecast a 3
percent increase in GDP, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  TD dropped 0.9 percent to C$77.15.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ,
its larger domestic rival, slipped 0.7 percent to C$52.33.  Bank
of Montreal (BMO) , the country’s fourth-biggest lender by assets,
declined 0.7 percent to C$59.22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
