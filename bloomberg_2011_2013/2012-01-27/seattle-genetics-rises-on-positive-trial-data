  Seattle Genetics Inc. (SGEN) , maker of the
Hodgkin lymphoma drug Adcetris, is trading at its highest level
in more than two months after reporting positive data from
additional studies on the medicine.  The drugmaker  gained  6.7 percent to $19.74 at 1:10 p.m. New
York time, the highest price for shares of the Bothell,
Washington-based company since Nov. 3.  Adcetris was approved in August for patients with Hodgkin
lymphoma for whom other therapies have failed, the first new
medicine cleared by U.S. regulators for the disease since 1977.
The drug had a 65 percent response rate according to interim
results of a Phase 2 clinical trial of patients with cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma, the company said yesterday at a medical meeting
in  San Francisco . Three stages of clinical trials are usually
required for U.S. regulatory approval.  Adcetris, known chemically as brentuximab, is Seattle
Geneticsâ€™s first product. Sales of the medicine may surpass $275
million in 2014, according to the  average estimate  of three
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
