Italian two-year notes rose for a
second day as the nation prepared to auction as much as 11
billion euros ($14.4 billion) of bills.  The advance pushed the yield on the securities toward the
lowest since September. Borrowing costs dropped as the nation
sold 4.5 billion euros of zero-coupon notes yesterday, amid
speculation investors are spending three-year loans from the
 European Central Bank ’s so-called Longer-Term Refinancing
Operation, or LTRO. German bunds headed for a  weekly advance  as
the failure of Greek officials to agree on a debt-swap deal with
creditors boosted demand for the safest European bonds.  “The auctions come in a very positive period for the
Italian paper,” Giuseppe Maraffino, a strategist at Barclays
Plc in London, wrote in an e-mailed note yesterday. “The
momentum is quite solid, especially at the front end, which has
benefited over the past few weeks from the big take-up at the
three-year LTRO held in December.”  Italy’s two-year note yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.55 percent at 9:19 a.m. London time after
dropping to 3.51 percent on Jan. 24, the lowest since Sept. 2.
The 2.25 percent notes due in November 2013 rose 0.07, or 70
euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.87.  The yield on 10-year bonds was little changed at 6.05
percent.  Germany ’s 10-year yield was also little changed, at 1.87
percent, after Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker 
told  France ’s Le Figaro newspaper in an interview that  Greece 
must avoid doing anything that would endanger financial help
from the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund .
Juncker leads the group of euro-area finance ministers. The bund
yield is down from 1.93 percent on Jan. 20.  Italian bonds returned a profit of 5 percent this year, and
Greek debt gained 0.2 percent, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.4 percent
this year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
