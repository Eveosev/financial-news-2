The U.S. Commerce Department said it
has again delayed its decision on additional tariffs for Chinese
solar-equipment imports.  A preliminary determination will be made on March 2, Tim
Truman, a department spokesman, said today. The decision had
been scheduled for Feb. 13.  The delay allows Commerce “sufficient time to conduct a
comprehensive investigation and to complete a thorough and fair
analysis of the subsidies at issue,” Gordon Brinser, the
president of  SolarWorld AG (SWV) ’s U.S. unit, said in a statement
issued by the Coalition for American Solar Manufacturing.  U.S. solar-equipment manufacturers say they are being
harmed because  China ’s government uses cash grants, discounts on
raw materials, preferential loans and tax incentives, and
manipulates its currency to boost exports of solar cells.
SolarWorld, a maker of solar modules, filed a complaint Oct. 19
with the U.S. International Trade Commission and the Commerce
Department, seeking duties to offset the practices.  The trade commission on Dec. 2 said the Chinese subsidies
have harmed equipment makers, ruling on the petition by Bonn-
based SolarWorld seeking antidumping and countervailing duties.  The commission is investigating possible economic harm to
SolarWorld from Chinese imports, while the department determines
the penalty for companies that illegally dump products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
