Iranian professor Seyed Mojtaba
Atarodi is being held in a U.S. prison in  California , federal
prison records show.  Atarodi, 54, is an associate professor in the electrical
engineering department at  Sharif University of Technology  in
Tehran and the author of dozens of scientific papers, according
to the school’s website and his attorney, Matthew David Kohn.
Atarodi is being held at a detention facility in Dublin,
California, about 35 miles southeast of  San Francisco , according
to the  U.S. Bureau of Prison ’s electronic inmate locator.  The  Associated Press  reported today that Atarodi had been
arrested and charged with buying scientific instruments from the
U.S., citing a Sharif University spokesman who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The AP reported that Atarodi appeared in
federal court in San Francisco today at a closed bail bond
hearing.  Atarodi’s family said after the hearing that he was
scheduled for release on bail subject to electronic monitoring,
partly for health reasons, AP reported. The hearing couldn’t be
independently confirmed in court records.  Kohn declined to comment on whether Atarodi had been
charged. Jack Gillund, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s
office in San Francisco, also declined to comment.  Agents from the Commerce Department, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Department of  Homeland Security  were
“uncompromising and meticulous,” Kohn said in a phone
interview today.  “I’m hoping for the best possible outcome for Dr.
Atarodi,” Kohn said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
