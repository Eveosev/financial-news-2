U.S. stocks erased losses as banks
rallied after the Obama administration said it will relax rules
on a loan-modification program and optimism grew that  Greece 
will reach a debt-restructuring agreement with bondholders.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,319.1 at 3:25 p.m. in New York. The index slipped as much as
0.5 percent earlier after U.S. economic growth trailed
forecasts.  The revised Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP,
would pay  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  to forgive debt on homes
that have lost value. The government-owned companies so far have
refused to reduce principal, citing cost. That policy has
limited HAMP’s reach because the two companies own or guarantee
nearly half of U.S. home loans.  The Institute of International Finance said progress was
made in talks in  Athens  today on the Greek debt swap and that
negotiations will continue tomorrow. Greek Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said the government was “one step away”
from completing talks on a voluntary debt swap and was
negotiating with international creditors on the terms for a
second financing package at the same time.  “We are a step away from completing the processes for the
PSI and we have to deal with a series of tough, open issues for
the new financing program,” Venizelos said in an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based ministry. “All these have to be
concluded within the next few days so that the public offer for
the PSI occurs before Feb. 15.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
