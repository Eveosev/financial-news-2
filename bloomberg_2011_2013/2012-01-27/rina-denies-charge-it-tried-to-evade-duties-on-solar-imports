Trina Solar Ltd. (TRINAZ) , a Chinese maker of
crystalline silicon panels, denied charges by a competitor that
it stepped up sales of solar cells in the U.S. at the end of
2011 to evade possible tariffs.  Trina increased shipments as buyers raced to take advantage
of a federal grant program before it ended Dec. 31, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today. The U.S. Treasury
Department’s 1603 program offered cash grants of as much as 30
percent of development costs for renewable-energy projects.  SolarWorld AG (SWV) , based in Bonn, alleges  China ’s government is
unfairly subsidizing solar-panel production. The German company,
which manufactures in the U.S., has asked the Commerce
Department to retroactively apply duties on imports arriving in
the U.S. as of Nov. 15, Timothy Brightbill, an attorney with
Wiley Rein LLP, a  law firm  that filed the petition, said
yesterday. The agency is scheduled to issue a ruling on
preliminary remedies to China’s subsidies on Feb. 13.  “We are opposed to any suggestion that our U.S. imports
surged as the result of efforts to evade potential tariffs,”
Trina said. Almost all of the Changzhou, China-based company’s
shipments “served orders tied to the federal 1603 grant
expiration,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
