customers, advanced for a fifth day, gaining 2.1 percent to 17
shillings, on speculation of higher earnings.  “People are pricing in full-year numbers early,” George
Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital
Ltd., said by phone today. “Generally we might see an upward
rating of banks ahead of the reporting season.”  Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB)  , a Nigerian unit of
Standard Bank Group Ltd., increased 5 percent, the most since
Dec. 16, to 6.98 naira, as investors bet the decline in the
nation’s lenders had been overdone ahead of full-year reports.  “It has fallen to a level where investors see it as being
attractive,” Adesoji Solanke, Lagos-based Africa bank analyst
with Rencap, said by phone today. There was “a surge” in
demand for bank stocks as investors are taking positions ahead
of release of the banks’ full-year 2011 results from the end of
February, Solanke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
