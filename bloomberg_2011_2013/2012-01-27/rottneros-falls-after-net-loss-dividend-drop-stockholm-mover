Rottneros AB (RROS) , a Swedish paper pulp
maker, fell the most in three months in Stockholm after the
company posted a fourth-quarter net loss and halved its dividend
payout compared with last year.  The share declined as much as 8.4 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Oct. 27. Stockholm-based Rottneros traded
5.9 percent, or 0.14 krona, lower at 2.25 kronor as of 1:20 p.m.
local time. Before today’s fall, the stock was up 13 percent
this year, after losing half its value in 2011.  Financial turmoil in  Europe  and high pulp inventories
pressured prices in the second half of last year and buyers
postponed purchases awaiting potential further price decreases,
Rottneros said today in a statement. Sales decreased 16 percent
in the fourth quarter and the company posted a net loss of 48
million kronor, compared with an 8 million-krona profit a year
earlier. The board proposed a dividend of 0.10 krona, down from
0.20 krona a year earlier.  “The prospects for 2012 are unusually uncertain although
they appear to be brighter,” Chief Executive Officer Ole Terland said, citing decreasing lumber and electricity prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
