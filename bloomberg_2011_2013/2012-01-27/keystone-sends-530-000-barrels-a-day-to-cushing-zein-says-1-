TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone
pipeline is carrying about 530,000 barrels a day to Cushing,
Oklahoma, said Abudi Zein, a vice president at Genscape Inc.  “You are starting to see Canadian coming into Cushing
again,” Zein said during a presentation at the Argus Americas
Crude Summit in Houston. “We are going to be in build mode for
a little while.”  Terry Cunha, a Calgary-based spokesman for TransCanada,
said the pipeline is delivering about 500,000 barrels a day.  The 591,000-barrel-a-day capacity line runs from Hardisty,
Alberta, to Wood River and Patoka, Illinois. A second leg of the
pipe runs to Cushing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
