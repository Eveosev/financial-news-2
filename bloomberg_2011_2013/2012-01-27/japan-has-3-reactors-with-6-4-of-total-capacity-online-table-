Japan  has three nuclear reactors
operating as of today with capacity of 3,138 megawatts, or 6.4
percent of the total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
News.  Chugoku Electric Power Co. shut the 820-megawatt No. 2
reactor at its Shimane nuclear plant in western Japan today for
regular maintenance as planned, Isao Oshimo, a spokesman for the
utility, said by phone. The company now has no reactor in
operation with no date set to restart generation at its sole
atomic station.  Reactors have been closed for maintenance, safety checks
and stress tests following the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
that caused reactor meltdowns and radiation leaks at Tokyo
Electric Power Co.â€™s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. None have yet
been approved for restart.  The following table shows the status of the 54 reactors
with capacity of 48,960 megawatts operated by Japanese power
companies. Capacity figures are in megawatts.
