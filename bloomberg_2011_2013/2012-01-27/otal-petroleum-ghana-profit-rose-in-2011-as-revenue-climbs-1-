Total Petroleum Ghana Ltd. (TOTAL) , a unit
of  Total SA (FP) , posted a 7.1 percent increase in annual profit in
the 12 months through December as revenue climbed.  Net income rose to 22.5 million cedis ($13.4 million),
while revenue grew 31 percent to 968.2 million cedis, the
company said in a statement published in the Accra-based
Business and Financial Times newspaper today.  Rising sales and administrative costs curbed what could
have been a higher profit figure, said Haruna Gariba, a stock
trader at Accra-based Merban Stockbrokers Ltd., by phone today.  Total’s cost of sales climbed 32 percent to 888.5 million
cedis while administrative and selling expenses advanced 35
percent to 60.9 million cedis, the company said.  Reining in expenses may boost investors’ confidence in the
stock, the fourth-highest priced shares on the exchange, Gariba
said. “If the company can cut down on expenses, the share price
could rise to 25 cedis this year,” he said.  The stock rose 1 pesewa to 19.84 cedis by the 3 p.m. close
in Accra, the capital, today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
