Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SAA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, posted its biggest
weekly gain in more than two years on rising gold and silver
prices.  Buenaventura climbed 2.4 percent to $43.01 in  Lima  trading
at 3:57 p.m. local time. The stock’s weekly increase would be
the biggest since October 2009.  Gold climbed to a seven-week high as the dollar weakened
after European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said Greece was close to reaching an agreement with
its creditors.  “Investors have factored in issues like protests against
the company’s Minas Conga project,” said Arlen Lahura, a trader
at Lima-based brokerage Coril SAB. “Now the market is just
taking into account gold prices.”  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,735.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
highest closing price since Dec. 7. Silver futures for March
delivery rose 0.1 percent to $33.79 an ounce on the Comex,
jumping 6.7 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
