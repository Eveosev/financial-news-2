Georgian wine exports increased last
year to $54.1 million, the most since  Russia  imposed a trade
embargo in 2006.  Exports rose 37.7 percent in 2011 from a year earlier to
16.9 million liters, the National Statistics Office of Georgia
in Tbilisi said in an e-mailed statement today. Ukraine, Belarus
and Kazakhstan topped the list of customers.  Russia prohibited imports of Georgian mineral water and
wine in 2006 after Georgia expelled four Russian servicemen whom
it accused of espionage. Georgia last year backed Russiaâ€™s bid
to join the  World Trade Organization , clearing the way for
formal approval of its membership bid on Dec. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
