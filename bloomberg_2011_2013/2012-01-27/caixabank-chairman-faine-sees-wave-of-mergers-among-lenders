CaixaBank SA (CABK)  Chairman Isidro Faine
said he expects a “wave of mergers” in the banking industry as
lenders seek to cut costs and boost economies of scale.  CaixaBank,  Spain ’s fourth-biggest bank, may be interested
in expanding at home and abroad should the right opportunities
arise, Faine said at a press conference in Barcelona today. The
company isn’t in talks with any firm at the moment, he said.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has said he’ll
announce by mid-February new rules aimed at pressing banks to
recognize real-estate losses on their balance sheets as he also
seeks to push more lenders into mergers. Juan Maria Nin,
CaixaBank’s chief executive officer, said today in Barcelona
that there is still 20 percent overcapacity in the Spanish
banking system.  “About 20 percent is the restructuring that still almost
certainly has to be done,” Nin said. Meanwhile, creating a
bigger company out of the La Caixa banking group would be
desirable as it would enable the firm to increase spending on
social programs, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
