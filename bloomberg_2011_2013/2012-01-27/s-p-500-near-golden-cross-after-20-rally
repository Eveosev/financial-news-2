The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  is
approaching the formation of a “golden cross” for the first
time since 2010, historically a signal that more gains are
likely to follow, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  The benchmark index for U.S. equities has jumped 20 percent
from its 2011 low in October as optimism grew that the world’s
largest economy will withstand  Europe ’s debt crisis. The rally
pushed its 50-day moving average to 0.2 percent away from
exceeding the average price for the prior 200 days.  Technical analysts, who study price charts to predict
market moves, call it a “golden cross” when a 50-day average
moves higher than a 200-day average while both are rising, and
say it shows a pickup in momentum that may herald more gains.  The  S&P 500  has produced 16 “golden crosses” since 1962,
75 percent of which were followed by positive returns in the
next six months, with gains averaging 4.4 percent, according to
Birinyi.  “While we choose to disagree with many of the technical
analysts’ forecasts and predictions, we would be amiss to not
analyze the historical performance and patterns following this
market event,” Kevin Pleines, an analyst with the Westport,
Connecticut-based firm, wrote in a note today. “We have found
that this technical indicator has some merit.”  There were 26 instances in the past 50 years when the S&P
500’s short-term average crossed above the long-term gauge,
according to Birinyi. The index rose 81 percent of the time with
an average increase of 6.6 percent in the next six months, the
data show.  Stocks posted bigger returns when the S&P 500’s 50-day rose
above a falling 200-day, Birinyi data show. The index jumped an
average 10 percent over the next six months, according to the
study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
