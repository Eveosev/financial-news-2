  Prudential Plc (PRU)  Chief Executive
Officer  Tidjane Thiam  said he’s concerned about the potential
“unintended consequences” of Solvency II regulation.  If “certain versions” of Solvency II, insurance rules to
come into force in 2013, are implemented, investing in corporate
bonds, infrastructure and some bank assets will be “very
difficult,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Davos,
 Switzerland  at the  World Economic Forum .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
