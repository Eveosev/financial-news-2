Ryland Group Inc. (RYL)  declined in
heavier-than-normal trading after the homebuilder missed
analysts’ estimates while reporting its first profitable quarter
without tax assistance since 2006.  Ryland, which builds homes with an average price of
$255,000 in 13 states, fell 1 percent to $18.40 at the close in
 New York . More than 3.27 million shares changed hands today,
compared with a daily average volume of 1.31 million for the
past year.  The company, based in  Westlake Village ,  California ,
reported fourth-quarter net income of $812,000, or 2 cents a
share, compared with a loss of $19.1 million, or 43 cents, a
year earlier, according to a statement released yesterday after
markets closed. Analysts expected net income of 9 cents, the
average of 17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “While orders and gross margins improved in 4Q, we believe
that expectations were high going into the quarter,”  Megan McGrath, an analyst with MKM Partners LLC, wrote in a note to
investors today. Fourth-quarter results “could be regarded as a
disappointment,” she said.  U.S. builders have struggled to profit as high unemployment
and mortgage delinquencies stifled the housing market. About
302,000 new homes were sold in the U.S. in 2011, the worst year
in records dating to 1963, the Commerce Department reported
yesterday.  Ryland has lost money each quarter since 2006 except for
the last three months of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2009,
when it recorded a $39 million profit after booking a refund of
taxes paid during its profitable years.  Ryland also  filed  a shelf registration today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission to prepare a possible
offering of new debt, shares or warrants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
