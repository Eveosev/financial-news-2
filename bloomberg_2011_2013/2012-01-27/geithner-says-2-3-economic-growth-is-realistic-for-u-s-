U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said it is “realistic” for the  U.S. economy  to grow
about 2 percent to 3 percent.  “That’s a realistic outcome for the U.S. economy so long
as we see a little more progress in  Europe  and we don’t see a
lot of risk come from  Iran  on the oil front,” he said at the
 World Economic Forum ’s annual meeting in Davos,  Switzerland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
