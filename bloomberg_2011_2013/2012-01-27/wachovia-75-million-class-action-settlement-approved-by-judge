A federal judge gave preliminary
approval to a $75 million cash settlement of a class-action
lawsuit against  Wachovia Corp (WB) . over  mortgage loans .  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan approved the
settlement on behalf of buyers of Wachovia stock from May 2006
to September 2008, according to a filing today in Manhattan. A
hearing on the settlement is scheduled for June 1.  The plaintiffs, which include the pension funds of  New York 
City public employees, sued in 2008, claiming that Wachovia,
after acquiring mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp. in
2006, began to focus on nontraditional mortgage loans, lowering
standards for borrowing and marketing aggressively to build
volume. The lawsuit claims the company made “false and
misleading statements” to shareholders.  Those who acquired Wachovia stock through its purchase of
Golden West are also entitled to the settlement, according to
the filing.  Wachovia was acquired by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  in 2009. Wells
Fargo, based in  San Francisco , rose 55 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$29.60 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The case is In re Wachovia Equity Securities Litigation,
08-06171, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
