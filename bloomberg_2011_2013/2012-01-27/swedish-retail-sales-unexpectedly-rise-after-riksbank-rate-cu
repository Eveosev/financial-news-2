Swedish  retail sales  unexpectedly
rose in December after the Riksbank last month cut its benchmark
lending rate to boost slowing growth in the Nordic economy.  Sales rose a  monthly  0.1 percent after rising a revised 0.7
percent the previous month, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden 
said today. The  median estimate  of four economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 0.5 percent drop. Sales rose an annual 1.5
percent, after growing a revised 0.6 percent the previous month.  Swedish  consumer confidence  rose more than estimated this
month after the central bank cut its main rate by a quarter of a
percentage point to 1.75 percent last month to protect the
economy from the fallout from the European debt crisis.  Household credit growth was 5.2 percent in December,
slowing from 5.3 percent in November, Statistics Sweden said in
a separate statement. Analysts had forecast 5.1 percent growth.  The krona strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro to
8.8787 as of 9:34 a.m. in  Stockholm . Swedenâ€™s currency rose
0.2 percent versus the dollar to 6.7743.  To contact the reporter on this story:
