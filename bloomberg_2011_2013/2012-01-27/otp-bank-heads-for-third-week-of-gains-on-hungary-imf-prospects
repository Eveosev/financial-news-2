OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, advanced for a third week as bets the country will
obtain an international bailout added to this week’s rally in
global equities markets.  The shares rose as much as 1.5 percent and traded 0.2
percent higher at 4,125 forint by the close in Budapest,
completing a 8.1 percent weekly rally. The benchmark BUX  index (MXEF) 
increased 0.8 percent this week, compared with a 2.3 percent
jump in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  OTP has jumped 40 percent since Prime Minister Viktor Orban
said on Jan. 5 he was ready to discuss conditions for a
“quick” deal with the  International Monetary Fund  and the
European Union on financial aid.  Hungary ’s official aid talks
may begin at “any time” as there are no preconditions, Andras
Giro-Szasz, a government spokesman, said in an interview with
state-run M1 television today.  “Foreign investors are taking it for granted that the deal
with the IMF will happen,” Akos Horvath, an analyst at
Budapest-based brokerage Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., said in a
telephone interview today. “We shouldn’t forget though that
there’s been no talk yet of a concrete amount or duration for
the credit line or amendments to the central bank law, only
promises.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
