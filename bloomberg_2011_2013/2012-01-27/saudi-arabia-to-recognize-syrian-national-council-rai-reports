Saudi Arabia  will recognize the
opposition Syrian National Council as the “official
representative” of the Syrian people,  Al-Rai  reported, citing
Ahmed Ramadan, a member of the SNC’s executive council.  Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal told an SNC
delegation in Cairo last week that the kingdom would recognize
the group as the Syrians’ representative, Ramadan told the
Kuwaiti newspaper. Al-Rai didn’t say when the recognition would
take place.  Prince Saud also told the SNC delegation that Arab
countries are “convinced” the Syrian government “scuttled”
the work of the Arab League monitoring mission sent to  Syria ,
Al-Rai cited Ramadan as saying.  Bassma Kodmani, a spokeswoman for the opposition  Syrian
National Council , and Osama Nugali, a spokesman at the Saudi
Foreign Ministry in  Riyadh , couldn’t be reached for comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
