Bulgaria ’s Parliament voted in favor
of a plan to join the European financial stability pact if
exceptions on taxes and bailouts are accepted.  All 181 lawmakers present backed the motion unanimously to
endorse a European Union agreement on tougher rules for debt
reduction intended to fight the euro area’s debt crisis, Menda
Stoyanova, head of the assembly’s Budget and Finance Committee,
said in the capital Sofia today.  The conditions for joining the pact include that Bulgaria,
the poorest European Union member in terms of economic output
per capita, won’t be obliged to coordinate its tax and labor
policies with the 27-nation bloc. The Balkan country, which
hasn’t yet adopted the euro, also won’t take part in
international bailout packages for  Greece  and other indebted
euro-area states.  “The euro area’s debt crisis showed the need for stricter
financial rules, which we should support to help stave off the
crisis,” Stoyanova said in parliament. “Bulgaria will uphold
its position that tax and labor policies should be decided on a
national level.”  Bulgaria weathered the global crisis without borrowing from
international lenders. The country has the lowest personal and
corporate income-tax rate in the bloc at 10 percent, to curb  tax
evasion , attract investment and boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
