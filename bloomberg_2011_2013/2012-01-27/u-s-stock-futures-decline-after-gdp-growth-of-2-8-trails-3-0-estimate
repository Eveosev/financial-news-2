U.S. stock-index futures retreated
after the American economy grew less than estimated in the
fourth quarter.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
March slipped 0.1 percent to 1,313.7 at 8:32 a.m. in  New York .  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, climbed at a 2.8 percent annual following a 1.8
percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures
showed. The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 3 percent increase. Excluding a jump
in inventories, growth was 0.8 percent.  The S&P 500 has increased 0.2 percent this week, extending
its year-to-date gain to 4.8 percent, amid better than-estimated
earnings and the  Federal Reserve ’s plans to safeguard growth by
keeping  interest rates  low until at
least the end of 2014 and consider purchasing more bonds if
necessary. The index is up almost 20 percent from last year’s
low in October, while still 16 percent below its record in
October 2007.    Sixty-six percent of the 164 companies in the  S&P 500 
that have reported results since Jan. 9 have topped analysts’
estimates for per-share profit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Earnings have grown 3.5 percent for the group on a
5.8 percent increase in sales.  The gauge is trading at 12.6 times projected
earnings, compared with a valuation of 11.2 in August, Bloomberg
data show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
