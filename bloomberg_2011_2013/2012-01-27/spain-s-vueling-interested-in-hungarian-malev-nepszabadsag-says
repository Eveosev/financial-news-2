Spain ’s  Vueling (VLG)  Airlines SA may buy
a stake in  Malev Zrt. (MALEV) , Hungary’s unprofitable state-owned
carrier,  Nepszabadsag  reported today, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The decision hinges on the vote of Vueling’s board of
directors, scheduled for February, according to the Budapest-
based newspaper.  Malev is close to financial collapse as a result of bad
contracts signed under the previous governments, Nepszabadsag
said, citing Gyula Budai, commissioner in charge of government
accountability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
