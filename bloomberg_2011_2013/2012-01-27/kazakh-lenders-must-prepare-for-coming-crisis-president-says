Kazakhstan’s financial sector should
prepare for a coming crisis, President  Nursultan Nazarbayev 
said, while calling for regulators to ensure the stability of
the local currency.  Nazarbayev ordered the government and National Bank of
Kazakhstan to report next week on “what to do with the banking
system and problem banks.” The regulator and the government
should keep the tenge steady to protect exports, the Kazakh
leader said today during a meeting in the capital, Astana.  The tenge has been stable since a devaluation in February
2009, central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko said. Since then,
the Kazakh currency has traded in the corridor of 145 to 153 per
dollar. That compares to a 20 percent gain of the ruble in the
same period.  “We’re not planning any changes in the country’s currency
policy,” Marchenko told today to reporters in Astana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
