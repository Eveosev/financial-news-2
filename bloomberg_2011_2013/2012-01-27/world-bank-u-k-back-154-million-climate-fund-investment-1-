The World Bank’s International
Finance Corp. and U.K. government will back a private-equity
fund with about $154 million to invest in companies that are
developing technology to tackle  climate change .  The IFC board approved as much as $75 million and the U.K.
50 million pounds ($79 million) for the fund, the IFC, based in
 Washington , said today in a statement.  The IFC Climate Catalyst Fund LP will invest in companies
working on technology to curb emissions and increase resource
efficiency, according to the statement. The fund aims to entice
further private money into climate projects by reducing the risk
of investing in  emerging markets , the IFC said.  Governments are trying to spur private investment to help
provide the $38 trillion that the  International Energy Agency 
says is needed by 2035 to meet energy demand. Two-thirds is
needed in countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development, according to the Paris-based IEA.  “For too long the power of the private sector has been
forgotten in the fight against global challenges,”  Andrew Mitchell , international development secretary, said in the
statement. “Climate change affects us all but it will hit the
poorest the hardest.”  The fund will hold a portfolio of private-equity funds
overseen by emerging market managers, as well as directly co-
investing in young companies, the IFC said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
