Serbiaâ€™s current-account deficit
widened 34 percent in the first 11 months of 2011 from the same
period a year earlier, the National Bank of Serbia reported on
its website today.  The shortfall was 2.5 billion euros ($3.23 billion),
compared with a gap of 1.84 billion euros, the Belgrade-based
bank said.  Remittances, one of the main sources of capital inflows,
declined 9.6 percent, while foreign direct investment dropped to
1.51 billion euros from 1.57 billion euros at the end of
October, the bank said.  Portfolio investment decreased to 1.62 billion euros at the
end of November from 1.64 billion at the end of the previous
month. A total of 1.5 billion euros remained invested in
Serbian government debt, the report showed.  Serbia is expected to show a full-year deficit equivalent
to 7.5 percent of its gross domestic product, or 32.9 billion
euros, according to government estimates. The  International
Monetary Fund  sees the deficit expanding by a percentage point
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
