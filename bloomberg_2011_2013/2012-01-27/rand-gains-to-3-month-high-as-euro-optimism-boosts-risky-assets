The rand advanced to a three-month
high, set for its third weekly gain, after borrowing costs fell
at an Italian bill sale, boosting optimism the Euro region’s
debt crisis is easing and fueling demand for riskier assets.  South Africa ’s currency gained as much as 0.6 percent to
7.7478 per dollar, the strongest level since Oct. 31. It traded
0.3 percent up at 7.7704 as of 2:07 p.m. in Johannesburg,
bringing its gain this week to 2.3 percent, the biggest five-day
advance since the week ended Dec. 23. Against the euro, the rand
appreciated 0.2 percent to 10.2075 for a weekly gain of 0.8
percent.  A  measure  of commodity prices increased for a third day and
an  index  of emerging-market stocks rose to a five-month high
after European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner
 Olli Rehn  said authorities are “very close” to reaching an
agreement on private-sector involvement in a Greek debt swap.
Talks made “some progress” yesterday and continue today, said
the  Institute of International Finance , which is representing
private creditors.  The increase of risk appetite can be seen in the very
strong rally of EM currencies such as the ruble, lira and rand
over the past week,’’  George Glynos , an analyst at ETM Analytics
in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “Judging by the way
these currencies sold off during the European crisis, the way
they are now rallying suggests the Europe crisis is behind us.
Expect to see these gains extend in coming weeks.”  Bonds Gained  Italy’s Treasury sold 8 billion euros ($11 billion) of 182-
day bills at 1.969 percent, the lowest yield since May and down
from 3.251 percent at the previous auction Dec. 28.  Bonds gained for a second day, driving the yield on 6.75
percent notes due 2021 down seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.67 percent, the lowest in five months, as
the  Federal Reserve ’s forecast of “exceptionally low”  interest
rates  through 2014 spurred demand for higher-yielding assets.  Foreign investors were net purchasers of 3.43 billion rand
($442 million) worth of South African bonds yesterday, the most
in a day since Nov. 8, according to JSE Ltd. data.  “Foreigners were aggressive buyers of our bonds yesterday
and while the data is exceptionally volatile, you can start to
see a trend toward buying,” Cairns said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
