The arena for the  London  2012
Olympic basketball and handball competitions may be sold for use
at the 2016 Summer Games in  Rio de Janeiro , the Olympic Delivery
Authority said today.  The white cube-shaped stadium in the Olympic Park may be
sold for less than the 30 million pounds ($47 million) it cost
to build the temporary venue, ODA Chairman John Armitt said in
an interview today. The Authority may also sell some seating at
the Aquatics Centre for the 2016 Games in Brazil.  The 12,000-seat stadium in Londonâ€™s east end took 15 months
to build and will be used for wheelchair rugby and wheelchair
basketball after the Games. To save money, the city is
constructing temporary venues or using existing ones, such as
Horse Guards Parade for the beach volleyball competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
