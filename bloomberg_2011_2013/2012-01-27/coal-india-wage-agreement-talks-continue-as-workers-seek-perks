Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s biggest
producer of the commodity, and labor unions are continuing talks
today on a wage agreement amid a demand by workers for
additional perks and allowances.  “The trade unions have given a fresh proposal and we
continue to discuss that,” Coal  India  personnel director R.
Mohan Das said today in New Delhi. “I am hopeful that an
agreement will emerge today.”  The company, based in Kolkata, held talks with unions
earlier this month and was close to an agreement on a 25 percent
wage increase, Das said on Jan. 13. Wages at state-owned Coal
India are revised every five years for non-executive employees
and were previously increased by an average 24 percent in 2006,
in an agreement reached in January 2009.  “The trade unions have given a diluted proposal for an
increase in allowances and other employee benefits, but the
management is not willing to accept that,” Jibon Roy, a
secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said in an
interview today. “We are not willing to accept just a 25
percent increase in wages.”  The unions are demanding improved allowances for workers,
health insurance and better retirement benefits, Roy said today
at the venue of a meeting on wages. The Centre of Indian Trade
Unions is one of five that’s negotiating with the Coal India’s
management.  Coal India fell 0.3 percent to 341.95 rupees at close in
Mumbai trading. The benchmark Sensitive Index climbed 0.9
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
