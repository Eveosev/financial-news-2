The euro erased gains against the
dollar after a report showed the  U.S. economy  grew less than
forecast in the fourth quarter, damping demand for riskier
assets.  The 17-nation currency was headed for a second straight
weekly gain after European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said Greece was “close” to reaching
agreement with its creditors. The yen strengthened against all
of its 16 most-traded counterparts.  “The euro turned negative after U.S. GDP was a little on
the disappointing side, ” said  Fabian Eliasson , head of U.S.
currency sales at Mizuho Financial Group Inc. in New York. “The
major driver for the market is still what will hopefully come
out of Greece.”  The euro was little changed at $1.3109 at 9:14 a.m.  New
York  time, paring the week’s gain to 1.4 percent. The shared
currency rose earlier by as much as 0.4 percent. The yen added
0.8 percent to 76.86 per dollar. Japan’s currency appreciated
0.8 percent to 100.74 per euro.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, climbed at a 2.8 percent annual following a 1.8
percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington. The median forecast of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 3 percent increase.
Excluding a jump in inventories, growth was 0.8 percent.  -- Editors:  Paul Cox , Kenneth Pringle  To contact the reporters on this story:
