India ’s crude oil output declined
for the third month in December as production by  Oil & Natural
Gas Corp.  and non-state companies dropped.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer  pumped  3.2 million
metric tons of crude last month, 5.6 percent lower than a year
earlier, the oil ministry said in a statement today.  Production by state-owned ONGC, the nation’s largest energy
explorer, fell 4.8 percent to 2 million tons, the ministry said.
The company’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.4 million tons, a
decline of 5.9 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for 44 percent
of India’s oil output.  Production by non-state explorers fell 9.9 percent to
857,600 tons. Output from offshore areas, including fields
operated by  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and BG Group Plc, declined
24 percent. In Rajasthan state, where  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  operates
the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, production fell 0.1
percent to 540,300 tons, according to the data. Cairn India
started the field in August 2009.  Oil India Ltd., the second-biggest state-run explorer,
reported a 1.9 percent increase in output to 315,800 tons,
according to the statement.  Natural  gas output  in the country fell for the 13th month,
declining 11 percent to 3.9 billion cubic meters, according to
the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
