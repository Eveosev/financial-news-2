U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lower for a second day, after a
report showed the world’s largest economy expanded less than
forecast in the fourth quarter as consumers curbed spending.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  slumped 4.2 percent as profit missed
estimates on overseas challenges.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-
largest U.S. energy company, slid 2.5 percent after reporting
its biggest earnings decline in two years. T. Rowe Price Group
Inc., the asset manager that has posted a profit every quarter
since going public in  1986 , dropped 2 percent as earnings fell.
Banks in the S&P 500 rose 1.1 percent as optimism grew that
Greece will reach an agreement with bondholders.  The S&P 500 decreased 0.2 percent to 1,316.33 as of 4 p.m.
New York time. The benchmark gauge for American equities still
capped a four-week gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
retreated 74.17 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,660.46 today.  “When we sneeze, the world catches a cold,” said  Lawrence Creatura , who helps oversee $350 billion as a Rochester, New
York-based fund manager at Federated Investors Inc. “Our health
is very important. People’s main concern is not today’s GDP
number, but what comes next. Did the Fed describe their tools
very explicitly earlier in the week because it suspected GDP
could be soft? The answer is probably yes.”  Equities fell on data showing that gross domestic product,
the value of all goods and services produced, climbed at a 2.8
percent annual rate following a 1.8 percent gain in the prior
quarter. The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 3 percent increase. Growth excluding
a jump in inventories was 0.8 percent. The  Federal Reserve  this
week signaled low rates through at least late 2014 and didn’t
rule out bond purchases to bolster the economy.  ‘One Step Away’  The  S&P 500   briefly  rose as banks rallied after the Obama
administration said it will relax rules on a loan-modification
program and optimism grew that Greece will reach a debt-
restructuring agreement with bondholders. Greek Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said the government was “one step away”
from completing talks on a voluntary debt swap and was
negotiating with international creditors on the terms for a
second financing package at the same time.  “People don’t want to be too short going into the weekend
because we may have some positive news out Greece,”  Mark Bronzo , who helps manage about $24 billion at Security Global
Investors in Irvington, New York, said in a telephone interview.
“The positive news out of Greece from a credit standpoint helps
people get more comfortable, which is always good for the
banks,” he said.  Banks Rally  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 stocks added 0.7 percent.  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)  rallied 1.9 percent to $29.60.  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF)  increased 2.7 percent to $5.31.  The S&P 500 Automobiles & Components Index dropped 2.5
percent, the most among 24 industries. Ford slumped 4.2 percent
to $12.21. In the fourth quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based
automaker was hamstrung by a weakening European market and
flooding in Thailand that wiped out profits in its Asian
operations, Chief Financial Officer  Lewis Booth  said today.  Chevron slid 2.5 percent, the biggest decline in the Dow,
to $103.96. Chief Executive Officer John Watson has been selling
oil refineries and filling stations in  Europe  and Africa to
focus on higher-profit crude production and gas-liquefaction
projects.  T. Rowe Price (TROW)  retreated 2 percent to $59.82. Net income
decreased 1.7 percent to $188.4 million, or 73 cents a share,
from $191.6 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-
based company said today in a statement.  Network Upgrades  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  slumped 3 percent to $21.69. The No.
2 maker of networking equipment declined after its first-quarter
forecast missed estimates, a sign Internet providers are
delaying network upgrades.  Solar shares gained as chief executive officers from
Suntech Power Holdings Co. and Trina Solar Ltd. said  China  may
double its installations of solar panels this year, absorbing
excess production that depressed prices and margins in 2011.
Suntech added 7.7 percent to $3.49. Trina rose 7.3 percent to
$8.67.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  climbed 11 percent to $45.54 for the
biggest gain in the S&P 500.  A gauge of homebuilders in S&P indexes advanced 0.7
percent.  D.R. Horton Inc. (DHI)  rallied 1.9 percent to $14.39. The
largest U.S. homebuilder by volume reported a first-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates after a year-earlier loss as
revenue from home sales rose.  Sharpie Pens  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL)  gained 8 percent to $18.82. The
maker of Sharpie pens and Graco car strollers reported fourth-
quarter earnings of 40 cents a share, excluding some items,
beating the average analyst estimate of 38 cents.  Eastman Chemical Co. (EMN)  rallied 7 percent to $50.41 after
agreeing to buy  Solutia Inc. (SOA)  for about $4.7 billion, including
debt, to drive expansion into higher-margin specialty plastics
and chemicals. Solutia surged 41 percent to $27.52.  The S&P 500 is approaching the formation of a “golden
cross” for the first time since 2010, historically a signal
that more gains are likely to follow, Birinyi Associates Inc.
said. Technical analysts, who study price charts to predict
market moves, call it a “golden cross” when a 50-day average
moves higher than a 200-day average while both are rising, and
say it shows a pickup in momentum that may herald more gains.  The S&P 500 has produced 16 “golden crosses” since 1962,
75 percent of which were followed by positive returns in the
next six months, with gains averaging 4.4 percent, according to
Birinyi.  “While we choose to disagree with many of the technical
analysts’ forecasts and predictions, we would be amiss to not
analyze the historical performance and patterns following this
market event,” Kevin Pleines, an analyst with the Westport,
Connecticut-based firm, wrote in a note today. “We have found
that this technical indicator has some merit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
