NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  is optimistic
there will be “additional opportunities” to make renewable-
energy asset acquisitions, Chief Financial Officer Moray
Dewhurst said today during a conference call with investors.  Project owners and developers may be able to make decisions
on selling assets if there’s a clear U.S. renewable-energy
policy, Dewhurst said. NextEra hasn’t included any potential
asset purchases in its financial forecasts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
