Ukraine’s grain planting for the
2012 harvest will decline by around 4 percent to 15.4 million
hectares (38 million acres) after drought damaged winter grains,
agriculture researcher ProAgro said.  Farmers will have to re-seed 2.2 million hectares of winter
grains, including 300,500 hectares of rapeseed, the Kiev-based
researcher said today by e-mail. Wheat planting will probably
decline to 5.5 million hectares from 7.02 million.  Corn planting may rise to 4.4 million hectares, ProAgro
said. Winter barley areas will fall by 19 percent to 1.04
million hectares and spring barley will rise by 13 percent to
2.93 million hectares, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporters on this story:
