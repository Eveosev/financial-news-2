Elanders AB (ELANB) , a Swedish printing
group with units on four continents, rose the most in over five
months after reporting a quarterly profit and saying it expects
higher pretax income this year.  The share rose as much as 13 percent, the biggest increase
since Aug. 15, making it the top gainer in the Stockholm All
Share Index. The Molnlycke, Sweden-based company traded 11
percent, or 2.30 kronor, higher at 23.40 kronor as of 12:48
p.m., local time.  Fourth-quarter sales increased 10 percent to 538 million
kronor ($79.4 million) and net income was 75 million kronor,
compared with a loss of 5 million kronor a year earlier. Sales
and pretax profit for the current year are predicted to be
higher than in 2011 while the consolidation of the printing
business continues, Elanders said today in a statement.  “The positive development verifies that Elanders’
strategic choices have been fruitful,” Chief Executive Officer
Magnus Nilsson said. “In 2012 we will continue to work on
consolidating and optimizing our production units and intensify
the development of new products and services.”  Elanders on Sep. 13 agreed to acquire some operations of
NRS Tryckeri in Huskvarna and bought part of Falth & Hassler’s
business on Jan. 24 last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
