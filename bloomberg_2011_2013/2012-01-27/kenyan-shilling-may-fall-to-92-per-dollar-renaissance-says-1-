The Kenyan shilling may weaken to 92
per dollar by the end of the year from about 85 now because of
declining reserves and rising government spending before
elections,  Renaissance Capital  said in a note to clients today.  The shilling has rallied from a 17-year-low of 106.75 in
October as the Central Bank of Kenya, led by Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, increased its policy rate by 11.75 percentage points to
a record 18 percent since September.  Inflation (KNPRIYY)  in  East Africa ’s largest economy accelerated to
to 19.7 percent in November, before easing to 18.9 percent in
December, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-
mailed statement on Dec 28.  Economic growth may accelerate this year to 4.8 percent
from 4.3 percent in 2011 on better rainfall, Renaissance said,
while credit growth may slow to between 10 percent and 13
percent by year end from 25 percent to 30 percent at the end of
2011. Inflation may slow to 10 percent.  Usable official foreign-exchange reserves held by the
central bank decreased to $3.8 billion on Jan 20. from $3.813
billion as of January 13, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement on Jan 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
