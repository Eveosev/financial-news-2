Cocoa gained for a fourth day in
 London  and climbed to a two-month high in New York after falling
stockpiles in  Europe  added to speculation that dry weather will
curb supplies from West Africa.  Cocoa inventories with a valid grading certificate in
European warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe fell 1.8 percent
since Jan. 9, exchange data yesterday showed. Prices in London
have climbed 16 percent this year on speculation dry weather in
 Ivory Coast  and  Ghana  will damage their so-called mid-crops set
to be harvested through September.  “Lower stocks are supportive certainly at a time of
concerns about the mid-crop in West Africa,” said Keith Flury,
an analyst at Rabobank International in London.  Cocoa for March delivery climbed 0.3 percent to 1,596
pounds ($2,507) a metric ton at 10:19 a.m. in London on NYSE
Liffe. Prices have jumped 7.6 percent in four days.  In  New York , the March futures contract rose as much as 1.1
percent to $2,480 a ton on ICE Futures U.S., the highest price
for a most-active contract since Nov. 18. Prices in New York
have climbed 9.1 percent this week.  Ivory Coast’s mid-crop will be 260,000 tons, down from
300,000 tons last year, Rabobank estimates. Ivory Coast
accounted for 36 percent of world cocoa production in 2010-11,
estimates by the International Cocoa Organization show. The so-
called main crop, the larger of the two annual crops, ends in
March and the mid-crop usually starts in April, according to the
ICCO, an industry group of 15 exporting countries and 29
importing nations, according to data on its website.  White, or refined, sugar climbed 0.5 percent to $651.80 a
ton and raw sugar was unchanged at 24.73 cents a pound. Robusta
coffee futures fell 0.1 percent to $1,870 a ton and arabica
coffee declined 0.3 percent to $2.1915 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
