Milder weather in much of the
central and eastern U.S. next week may mean the region will use
about 20 percent less energy for heating than usual, according
to  David Salmon  of Weather Derivatives.  Temperatures along the East Coast and western Great Lakes
may be 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal (3.3 to 5.6
Celsius), said Salmon, a meteorologist at the Belton, Missouri-
based forecaster.  Salmon said he expect that most of the U.S. east of the
 Rocky Mountains  will be at least 6 degrees warmer than normal
from Feb. 2 to Feb. 6.  Traders watch long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling. About 51 percent
of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  In his 6- to 10-day outlook for Feb. 1 to Feb. 5, Commodity
Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers  predicts that
temperatures will rise 15 degrees above normal across Alberta
and Montana and about 8 degrees above normal across the northern
Great Plains and Rocky Mountains.  The Northeast, including New York, will probably average
about 5 degrees above normal, said Rogers, who is based in
Bethesda,  Maryland .  MDA EarthSat Weather , based in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
issued a similar forecast, while forecasting more seasonal
temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and Texas.  In its 11- to 15-day outlook, MDA calls for the eastern
U.S. to return to more seasonal temperatures with the Southeast
to be 3 to 4 degrees below normal. Rogers made a similar
forecast for the same timeframe.  Salmon doesn’t issue an 11- to 15-day prediction.  The normal average temperature in  New York  for Feb. 2 is 34
degrees, according to MDA. In Boston it’s 30; in Chicago, 24;
Atlanta, 45; Houston, 54; Seattle, 43; and Burbank,  California ,
56.  To contact the reporter on this story:
