Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts headed for a third weekly drop on mounting
speculation that the central bank will cut benchmark borrowing
costs and the government will implement new measures to keep
 Latin America ’s biggest economy growing.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.64 percent at 9:55
a.m. in Sao Paulo, bringing the weekly decline to 18 basis
points.  Futures yields plunged yesterday after the central bank’s
board said it sees a “high probability” the Selic rate,
currently at 10.5 percent, will be below 10 percent this year.
Traders are stepping up bets on deeper rate cuts amid
speculation the government is preparing new measures to
guarantee economic growth of at least 4 percent, Sao Paulo-based
newspaper Valor Economico reported today, citing unidentified
government officials.  “The government has an interest in making  Brazil  grow,”
Alfredo Barbutti, an economist at Liquidez DTVM Ltda, said by
phone from  Sao Paulo .  The real advanced 0.4 percent to 1.7424 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1.7491 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
