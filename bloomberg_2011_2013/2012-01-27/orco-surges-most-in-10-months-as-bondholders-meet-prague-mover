Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA rose the most
in 10 months as bondholders of the company’s German unit meet
today to vote on the management’s plan to exchange the bonds for
the company’s shares.  The stock jumped 7.9 percent to 96 koruna at its close in
Prague, its biggest one-day advance since March 25. Turnover was
72,804 shares, almost six times the average traded volume in the
past three months. In Paris, its home market, Orco last traded
up 3 percent to 3.80 euros.  The developer in central  Europe , which is overhauling its
business under a court-approved plan, seeks to restructure 129.1
million euros ($169 million) of Orco Germany SA’s notes maturing
in May this year by swapping them into the parent’s shares, the
company said in a Jan. 10  statement  on its website.  “If the bondholders approve the plan today, it will
significantly boost chances for the restructuring of Orco’s
German unit,” Petr Bartek, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS in
 Prague , said by phone. A refusal “would be strongly negative,
but we expect the proposal will be approved,” Bartek wrote in
an e-mail to clients earlier today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
