a nuclear military program and is attempting to conceal it from

military program,” he said during a debate in Davos,
 Switzerland . “Some of their activities don’t have other
possible explanations. They are ready to fight and deceive the
whole world to turn into a nuclear miliary power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
