Italian bonds rose, with two-year
yields sliding to the lowest since September, after the nation
sold bills at lower yields amid mounting optimism  Greece  is
nearing a deal with its creditors.  Spain’s  10-year bonds  gained the most this year, extending
this month’s advance as the  European Central Bank ’s provision of
three-year loans to banks in December boosted demand. Italy
auctioned 8 billion euros ($10.5 billion) of 182-day bills at
1.969 percent, the lowest yield since May. German 10-year bunds
underperformed after European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said authorities were “close”
to a deal on Greece, reducing safety demand.  “The market has benefited a bit from the ECB’s long-term
repo operation,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The
attitude of investors toward the peripherals since the ECB came
in has changed decisively, and even though there’s still some
uncertainty about Greece, it still hasn’t put investors off”
from buying Spanish and Italian bonds.  Italy ’s two-year yield fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.52 percent at 4:29 p.m. London time after
dropping to 3.49 percent, the lowest level since Sept. 2. The
2.25 percent note due in November 2013 climbed 0.11, or 1.1
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 97.91.  Ten-year yields declined 15 basis points to 5.9 percent.
The extra yield investors demand to hold the debt instead of
German bunds narrowed 14 basis points to 4.04 percentage points.
The spread was as wide as 5.75 percentage points on Nov. 9.  Spanish Bonds  The Spanish 10-year  yield  fell 24 basis points to 4.97
percent after dropping as much as 25 basis points, the biggest
intraday decline since Dec. 28. The spread over bunds narrowed
to as little as 310 basis points, the least since Dec. 21.  “ Spain  has done very well today, certainly helped by the
recent auctions,” Stamenkovic said. “The authorities are
showing commitment to fiscal consolidation, they’ve put in
structural reforms, and investors for now are giving them the
benefit of the doubt.”  German bunds underperformed after Rehn said a deal between
Greece and its creditors may come as soon as today, damping
demand for safer assets.  “The next three days will be very crucial for the
future,” Rehn said at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
 Switzerland . An agreement may come “if not today, then over the
weekend,” he said.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.86 percent.
German bonds underperformed the debt of Italy, Spain,  Belgium ,
 Austria ,  France  and  Finland .  Greek Deadline  Greece must repay 14.5 billion euros of bonds in March and
an agreement that triggers as much as $3.2 billion of default
insurance may be necessary unless all bondholders approve,
according to Marco Buti, head of the European Commission’s
economics division.  Greece’s two-year yield dropped 28.86 percentage points to
171.28 percent, with the price rising to 22.67 percent of face
value. The yield surged to a record 206.86 percent on Jan. 23.  Volatility in Greek debt was the highest in euro-area
markets today, according to measures of 10-year bonds, the
spread between two- and 10-year yields, and credit-default
swaps. The change in spread was 11.5 times the 90-day average.  Italian bonds returned 5 percent this month through
yesterday, and Spanish debt gained 1.3 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Bunds have handed investors a loss
of 0.4 percent this year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
