Murray & Roberts Holdings Ltd. 
climbed to its highest in five months after Citigroup Inc. named
the South African construction company as one of its favorite
stocks.  Murray & Roberts  climbed  3 percent to 27.90 rand at the
close in Johannesburg, a second day of gains and the strongest
level since Aug. 17.  “Most fund managers are underweight the sector,” Drikus
Combrinck, a portfolio manager at PSG Konsult, said by telephone
from  Pretoria . “If you invest only when you see the recovery
then it’s way too late. You’ll see lots of money moving into the
construction sector this year.”  South African construction companies may grow profit by an
average 11 percent this year, Citigroup said in a note
yesterday, helped by a weaker rand and capital expenditure in
 Australia ’s mining sector. Murray & Roberts earned 18 percent of
its revenue in Australia in the year through June 2011,
according to its annual report.  The  FTSE/JSE Africa Construction & Material’s Index  slumped
26 percent last year, the worst performing index in  South
Africa . Murray & Roberts  dropped  36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
