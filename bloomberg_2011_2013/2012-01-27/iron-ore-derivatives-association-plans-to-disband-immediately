The Iron Ore and Steel Derivatives
Association will probably be reformed later this year under the
control of brokers.  The association “could not meet the liquidity requirements
to operate,” it said by e-mail today. It’s a non-profit group
representing traders and brokers of iron ore swaps and publishes
forward price assessments and newsletters.  Members include  BHP Billiton , Morgan Stanley Capital Group
and Cargill International, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
