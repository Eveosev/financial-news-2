(Corrects story that ran Jan. 26 to remove reserve from
headline, first paragraph and say before dividend payments in
second paragraph.)  Argentina’s  central bank  said it is
raising capital requirements for financial institutions to
comply with international standards.  Argentine banks will be required to hold an extra 75
percent of their minimum capital requirements before dividend
payments from the current 30 percent, the bank said today in an
e-mailed statement. The measure, which will be applied gradually
starting Feb. 1 through December, aims to comply with the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision .  “It has the double purpose of giving more security to
savers, as well as increasing the system’s resources to expand
credit,” the Central Bank said in the statement.  Following her Oct. 23 landslide re-election, President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  ordered energy and mining
companies to bring export revenue to the country after Argentina
faced record capital flight in the third quarter. She also told
insurance companies to repatriate investments held abroad,
tightened oversight of the foreign exchange market and raised
the amount of wheat farmers can sell abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
