Following is the text of the Gross
Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT:  FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL 2011  (ADVANCE ESTIMATE)  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and
services produced by labor and property located in the  United
States  -- increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2011 (that is, from the third quarter to the
fourth quarter), according to the "advance" estimate released by
the  Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the third quarter, real GDP
increased 1.8 percent.  The Bureau emphasized that the fourth-quarter advance
estimate released today is based on source data that are
incomplete or subject to further revision by the source agency .
The "second" estimate for the fourth quarter, based on more
complete data, will be released on February 29, 2012.  The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected
positive contributions from private inventory investment,
personal consumption expenditures (PCE), exports, residential
fixed investment, and nonresidential fixed investment that were
partly offset by negative contributions from federal  government
spending  and state and local government spending.  Imports, which
are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter
primarily reflected an upturn in private inventory investment and
accelerations in PCE and in residential fixed investment that
were partly offset by a deceleration in nonresidential fixed
investment, a downturn in federal government spending, an
acceleration in imports, and a larger decrease in state and local
government spending.  _________________  FOOTNOTE.  Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally
adjusted  annual rates, unless otherwise specified.  Quarter-to-
quarter dollar changes are differences between these published
estimates.  Percent changes are calculated from unrounded data
and are annualized.  "Real" estimates are in chained (2005)
dollars.  Price indexes are chain-type measures.  This news release is available on BEA's Web site along with
the Technical Note and Highlights related to this release.

fourth quarter, following a decrease of $2.0 billion in the third
quarter and an increase of $39.1 billion in the second.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in
private inventories -- increased 0.8 percent in the fourth
quarter, compared with an increase of 3.2 percent in the third.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S.

personal saving in BEA's national income and product accounts
with personal saving in the Federal Reserve Board's flow of funds
accounts and data on changes in net worth, go to

In the third quarter, current-dollar GDP increased 4.4 percent,
or $163.3 billion.  2011 GDP  Real GDP increased 1.7 percent in 2011 (that is, from the
2010 annual level to the 2011 annual level), compared with an
increase of 3.0 percent in 2010.  The increase in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected
positive contributions from personal consumption expenditures
(PCE), exports, and nonresidential fixed investment that were
partly offset by negative contributions from state and local
government spending, private inventory investment, and federal
government spending.  Imports, which are a subtraction in the
calculation of GDP, increased.  The deceleration in real GDP in 2011 primarily reflected
downturns in private inventory investment and in federal
government spending and a deceleration in exports that were
partly offset by a deceleration in imports and an acceleration in
nonresidential fixed investment.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.5
percent in 2011, compared with an increase of 1.5 percent in
2010.  Current-dollar GDP increased 3.9 percent, or $561.2
billion, in 2011, compared with an increase of 4.2 percent, or
$587.5 billion, in 2010.  During 2011 (that is, measured from the fourth quarter of
2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011), real GDP increased 1.6
percent.  Real GDP increased 3.1 percent during 2010.  The price
index for gross domestic purchases increased 2.5 percent during
2011, compared with an increase of 1.4 percent during 2010.  ________________  BOX.  Information on the assumptions used for unavailable
