CBS’s “Big Bang Theory” drew more
younger viewers than Fox’s “ American Idol ,” the most watched
show on TV, for a second straight week.  The  CBS Corp. (CBS)  show, a 30-minute comedy that airs at 8 p.m.
on Thursdays, is drawing more viewers ages 18 to 49, a group
targeted by advertisers, when it competes with “Idol,” CBS
said today, citing Nielsen data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
