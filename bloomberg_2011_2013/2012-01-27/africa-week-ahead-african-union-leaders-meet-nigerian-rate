African heads of state meet at the
annual African Union summit in  Addis Ababa ,  Ethiopia ’s capital,
from Jan. 29. The meeting has a theme of boosting intra-Africa
trade and will include statements from AU chairman Teodoro
Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, the current president of  Equatorial
Guinea , and United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon,
according to the agenda.  South African Home Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma
is seeking to depose AU Commission Chairman  Jean Ping  in a vote
during the two-day meeting.  Nigeria ’s central bank announces its decision on whether to
adjust its key  interest rate  on Jan. 31 in Abuja, the capital.
The rate, which was left unchanged at a record-high 12 percent
on Nov. 21, may be held “for a bit” as increases in fuel
prices add pressure to inflation, central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said Jan. 16.  Central banks in Kenya and  Uganda  will also meet to decide
on lending rates on Feb. 1. Kenya held its key rate at 18
percent on Jan. 11 and Uganda’s rate was maintained at 23
percent on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
