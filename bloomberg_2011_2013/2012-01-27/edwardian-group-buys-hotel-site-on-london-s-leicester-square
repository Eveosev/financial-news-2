Edwardian Group Ltd. , the U.K. hotel
group owned by Jasminder Singh, is buying the former Odeon
Cinemas Group Ltd. site on  London ’s Leicester Square and two
adjoining properties, according to Jennifer Mortimer, a
spokeswoman for Allsop LLP, a receiver for part of the site.  Edwardian Group operates the Radisson Edwardian hotel
chain. The group declined to comment through Rita Rowe, an
external spokeswoman. Mortimer declined to comment on the
purchase price.  The Edwardian Group already owns 14 hotels, including two
others on Leicester Square. It bought the 169-room New
Providence Wharf Hotel in London’s Canary Wharf in November and
the Free Trade Hall hotel in Manchester,  England , in October.  Knight Frank LLP and CBRE Group Inc. had been appointed to
sell the site, which has planning permission for a 245-room
hotel. It was said to have attracted more than 15 bidders. Part
of the site was put into receivership by Ireland’s National
Asset Management Agency, which was set up to purge the country
of commercial property loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
