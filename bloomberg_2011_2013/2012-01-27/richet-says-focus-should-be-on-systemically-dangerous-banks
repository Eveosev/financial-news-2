Former European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said that it wouldn’t be right to
go back to the fragility in the financial system that was
evident before the financial crisis.  “We have to do what is required by the circumstances,” he
said. “We cannot put ourselves in the situation as we were in
07-08.”  The international effort that must be implemented is
“entirely designed to have a system which is much less
fragile,” he said. “Nobody would forgive us to let the system
be as fragile tomorrow as it were three years ago.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
