The Greek government must fulfill
promises attached to earlier aid packages before expecting more
money, the  Stuttgarter Zeitung  reported, citing an interview
with German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble .  “We have enough proclamations; now the government in
 Athens  must act,” the newspaper quoted Schaeuble as saying in
an e-mailed preview of an interview to be published today. “We
insist that  Greece  fulfill the requirements of the initial aid
program,” which it hasn’t fully implemented, the newspaper
cited him as saying.  Greece must meet those conditions before another aid
package can be considered, the newspaper said, quoting Schaeuble
as saying that there’s still enough capacity in the current
European Financial Stability Facility rescue package.  The newspaper also cited Schaeuble as saying there is
“frustration” that the U.S. hasn’t addressed its “debt
problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
