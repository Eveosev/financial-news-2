Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya’s  biggest
lender by customers, rose for the fifth day, its longest streak
of gains in two months, on speculation of higher earnings.  The stock jumped 2.1 percent to 17 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Nairobi, the longest rally since Nov. 10.  “People are pricing in full-year numbers early,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital
Ltd., said by phone today. “Generally we might see an upward
rating of banks ahead of the reporting season.”  In the nine months to September, Equity’s net income jumped
to 7.29 billion shillings ($85.8 million), from 5.13 billion
shillings a year earlier, it said Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
