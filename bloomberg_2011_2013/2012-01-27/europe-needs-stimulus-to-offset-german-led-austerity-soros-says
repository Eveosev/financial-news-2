Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said  Germany  is “dictating” austerity for the euro area that
needs to be offset with an economic stimulus as a “second
phase.”  While Germany has “a right to take that position” because
it chafes at being  Europe ’s paymaster, “you then still need a
stimulus,” Soros said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s  Erik Schatzker  in Davos,  Switzerland , today. “It’s
important that we should start thinking about it. Because
without it the situation is hopeless.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
