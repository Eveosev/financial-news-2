The European Union renewed 13-year-
old tariffs on steel ropes and cables from  China  and Ukraine to
curb competition for EU manufacturers including  ArcelorMittal (MT) 
while letting a levy against South Africa lapse.  The EU re-imposed the  import duties  for another five years
to punish Chinese and Ukrainian exporters for selling the ropes
and cables in  Europe  below cost, a practice known as dumping.
The rates are 60.4 percent for China and 51.8 percent for
Ukraine. The expiring duty on South Africa is 38.6 percent.  Chinese and Ukrainian exporters continue to undercut EU
producers and have “significant” spare capacity that could
pose an additional threat, the 27-nation bloc said in a decision
today in Brussels. The South African industry including  Scaw 
stopped undercutting European competitors and has “limited”
spare capacity, the EU said.  The combined Chinese and Ukrainian share of the EU market
for steel ropes and cables, which are used in industries ranging
from oil and shipping to construction and mining, fell to 2.2
percent in the 12 months through September 2010 from 3.8 percent
in 2007, according to the bloc.  South Africa ’s share dropped to
0.1 percent from 0.5 percent over the period, said the EU.  In addition to a French unit of ArcelorMittal, EU producers
of steel ropes and cables include British, German, Italian,
Spanish, Greek, Portuguese, Danish, Polish, Czech, Romanian and
Bulgarian companies, according to the bloc.  South Korea  The renewal of the duties against China and Ukraine and the
end of the levy against South Africa are the outcome of an
almost 15-month probe and will take effect after publication in
the EU’s  Official Journal  by Feb. 13. The investigation
prevented the levies against all three countries from expiring
as previously scheduled in November 2010.  In April 2010, the EU extended to  South Korea  the 60.4
percent tariff applied to China after concluding that Chinese
exporters shipped the goods via Korea to evade the levy. Since
2004, the EU has also applied to Morocco the duty against China
and to Moldova the 51.8 percent duty against Ukraine after
finding evidence of circumvention.  These arrangements will remain in place as a result of
today’s decision.  The EU introduced the taxes in 1999 and renewed them for
five years in November 2005. When it began the expiration review
in November 2010, the EU let lapse a similar duty of 30.8
percent against  India  that also was introduced in 1999 and
renewed in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
