German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
planned 6 billion-euro ($7.86 billion) income-tax cut may be
blocked by the opposition-dominated upper house of parliament,
Bild Zeitung said.  The upper house’s Finance Committee voted to recommend that
the chamber reject the measure, saying Germany can’t afford the
loss of  tax revenue , the newspaper reported today, without
saying how it got the information.  Merkel’s Christian Democrat-led coalition agreed in
November to lower taxes in two stages in 2013 and 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
