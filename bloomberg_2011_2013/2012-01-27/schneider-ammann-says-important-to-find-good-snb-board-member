Swiss Economy Minister Johann Schneider-Ammann said it’s more important to find a good
candidate to join the three-member  Swiss central bank  board
rather than electing a candidate soon.  “The Bank Council is the institution suggesting candidates
and that’s why the timing on the government electing a member
will hinge on the council,” Schneider-Ammann said in an
interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland ,
today. “It’s decisive that we’ll find a good solution. Whether
that’s sooner or later is secondary. It’s being worked on the
matter and that’s essential.”  He also said that the economy will show “weak growth”
this year, with the second half “a bit better” than the
previous six months. If “there’s a small dent, then it’s at
best a weak recession, we can’t see a strong recession.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
