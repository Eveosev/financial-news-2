Canadian natural gas fell on mild
U.S. weather that has kept supplies above seasonal norms.  Alberta  gas dropped 4.3 percent. Heating demand in the U.S.
will trail normal by 25 percent through Feb. 3, according to
forecaster Weather Derivatives. Mild weather has stemmed
withdrawals from gas stockpiles, leaving U.S. inventories 21
percent above the five-year average as of last week, according
to the  Energy Department. (DOENUST5)   “Inventories are at very high levels,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at INTL FC Stone LLC in
 St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota . “It’s still bearish for gas.”  Alberta gas for February delivery dropped 9.75 cents to
C$2.15 a gigajoule ($2.04 per million British thermal units) at
11:35 a.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX

Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.19 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 307 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
