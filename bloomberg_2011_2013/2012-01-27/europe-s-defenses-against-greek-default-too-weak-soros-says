Billionaire investor  George Soros 
said European policy makers haven’t done enough to insulate the
rest of the region from any Greek default.  “If  Greece  defaults it should not be the end of the
world,” Soros said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in
Davos,  Switzerland , today. “But the rest of  Europe  needs to be
sufficiently ring-fenced, and not enough has been done to ring-
fence it. Not enough has been done to isolate the rest of the
euro zone.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
