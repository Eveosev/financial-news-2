Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK) , an
independent refiner with two plants that also sells asphalt,
fell the most in more than two months after it reported a
fourth-quarter loss because of higher oil costs.  Delek fell 5.8 percent to close at $12.03 in New York, the
most since Nov. 17. The company said it would lose 10 to 20
cents a share from continuing operations as higher costs for
crude and a decline in asphalt prices crimped earnings,
according to a statement today. Analysts projected adjusted net
income of 32 cents a share, the average of nine estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “That is a major negative surprise,”  Paul Sankey , an
analyst for Deutsche Bank AG in  New York , said in a note to
clients today.  Delek, based in Brentwood, Tennessee, bought crude linked
to global prices and used U.S. oil futures contracts to protect
against price swings. When the gap between U.S. and global
prices that had been wide throughout the year narrowed in
November and December, the company was forced to overpay for its
oil, Delek said in the statement.  The company, which has refineries in El Dorado,  Arkansas 
and Tyler, Texas, is scheduled to  release  fourth-quarter
earnings after the market closes on March 7. Independent
refiners don’t explore for or produce oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
