The Bank of England’s first round of
so-called  quantitative easing  increased asset values by about 20
percent and pushed down yields by an average of about 150 basis
points in 2010, according to a central bank paper.  The 200 billion-pound ($314 billion) program of bond
purchases may have produced a “peak impact” on gross domestic
product of 2 percent by mid-2011 and on  inflation  of 1
percentage point by mid-2012, economists Jonathan Bridges and
Ryland Thomas wrote in the paper published in London today.  The central bank started a second round of bond purchases
in October as the economy slipped closer to a second recession.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter
and Governor  Mervyn King  said this week the bank has scope to
expand the program to keep inflation, now at 4.2 percent, from
falling below the 2 percent target.  The analysis of the bond purchases can be used to give
“some idea of what the counterfactual path of the economy would
have looked like in the absence of QE,” the authors wrote. “In
the absence of QE, the growth rates of asset prices and GDP
would have been notably weaker in 2009 and 2010.”  The bond purchases may also have increased the supply of
broad money by 122 billion pounds, or 8 percent, in 2010, the
paper said. “Money growth and velocity” in the absence of the
asset-purchase program in 2009 would have been similar to that
experienced in the recession of the 1990s, the authors wrote.

Economy -- Some Supportive Monetarist Arithmetic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
