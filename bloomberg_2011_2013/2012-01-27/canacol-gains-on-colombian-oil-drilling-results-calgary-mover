Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE) , the Canadian
company drilling for oil in Colombia with  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , rose the
most in more than two weeks after reporting “good” results
from a well in the Ubaque reservoir.  The shares  gained  3.5 percent to 90 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto. The stock has gained 17 percent this year.  Canacol’s Rancho Hermoso 14 well is complete and producing
at a rate of 7,666 barrels of oil a day, the Calgary-based
company said in a statement today. The well, begun on Dec. 23,
reached 10,294 feet and encountered “good oil and gas” during
drilling, Canacol said. More drilling is planned.  Canacol operates the Rancho Hermoso field under two
contracts with Ecopetrol,  Colombia ’s state-owned oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
