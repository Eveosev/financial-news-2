Europe  is focusing more on boosting
growth through reforms that increase confidence,  Finland ’s Prime
Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said in an interview with Maryam Nemazee
on Bloomberg TV today from Davos, Switzerland.  “We cannot afford to stimulate the economy,” Katainen
said. “Growth comes when the confidence comes back and the
confidence comes back when you do structural reforms even though
it takes time.”  While the European debt crisis is still “ongoing” and
reforms take years, “markets want to see decisions” by
indebted countries to reform their economies, Katainen said.  Finland has sought to increase burden sharing by investors
in the three bailouts that have taken place since the start of
the debt crisis. Katainen said he’s “worried” about the impact
of the crisis on the export-led Finnish economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
