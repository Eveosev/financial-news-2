U.S. cattle inventories fell to the
lowest in 60 years after a drought in the South scorched
pastures, prompting ranchers to shrink herds.  As of Jan. 1, beef and dairy farmers held 90.77 million
head of cattle, down 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a report. That’s the
fewest since 1952. Ten analysts in a Bloomberg News survey were
expecting a 1.5 percent decline.  “We had one of the biggest droughts in  Texas  this past
year,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime Agricultural
Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in telephone
interview before the report. “Guys have been ripping up pasture
and planting crops. It’ll take years for this thing to build
back up.”  Cattle futures in Chicago surged to a record $1.29675 a
pound on Jan. 25. Texas, the top state producer, had its driest
 year  on record in 2011, according to the  National Weather
Service . The drought destroyed pastures, forcing ranchers to
sell or slaughter animals rather than incur feed costs driven up
by corn, the main ingredient, which reached an all-time high in
2011.  Breeding Herd  The beef-cow herd totaled 29.88 million, down 3.1 percent
from a revised 30.85 million a year earlier and the lowest for
the date in 50 years, the USDA said. Analysts forecast a 2.6
percent decline. The number of young, female cattle for beef-cow
replacement rose unexpectedly to 5.21 million, up 1.4 percent. A
1.8 percent drop was forecast.  The heifers that are being held back will be bred this year
and produce calves this year or next,  Rich Nelson , the director
of research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a
telephone interview.  “Those heifers are not in the feedlot, so the short-term
supply is actually a little tighter, but we are starting
expansion for live cattle hitting the market” starting in mid-
2013, he said.  Cattle futures may open 0.2 cent higher on Jan. 30, Nelson
said. The contract for April delivery, the most-active, rose 0.4
cent, or 0.3 percent, to close at $1.2845 a pound today on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The price has climbed 15 percent in
the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement gained 0.6
percent to $1.546 a pound.  Record Beef  The USDA on Jan. 12 forecast total beef  output  at 25.075
billion pounds (11.4 million metric tons) this year, down 4.6
percent from an estimated 26.297 billion in 2011.  Wholesale beef , up 6.4 percent in the past 12 months,
reached $1.9707 a pound on Nov. 23, the highest since at least
2004, according to the USDA. Retail beef reached an all-time
high on an annual basis in 2011 and will climb through next
year, according to the Livestock Marketing Information Center, a
Denver-based researcher.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s biggest restaurant chain by
revenue with more than 33,000 outlets worldwide, is forecasting
higher beef costs. The  Oak Brook , Illinois-based company is the
largest user of beef among U.S. restaurants, according to
CattleFax, an industry researcher in Centennial,  Colorado .  McDonald’s will have “another midteens increase” in beef
costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Peter J. Bensen said on
an earnings conference call with analysts on Jan. 24.  The inventory of heifers for milk-cow replacement totaled
4.53 million on Jan. 1, down 0.9 percent from a year earlier,
the USDA said. The average analyst estimate was for a 1.5
percent increase.  Fewer Slaughtered  In 2011, the total number of calves born fell 1.1 percent
to 35.31 million from a year earlier, the lowest since 1950,
according to the USDA.  “Fewer calves being born means ultimately fewer cattle
will be slaughtered,” said  Ron Plain , a livestock economist at
the  University of Missouri  at Columbia, who has studied the
industry for three decades, said in a telephone interview.
“That means the tight beef supply is going to get tighter as we
go through 2012 and 2013 and 2014.”  Once the herd starts to expand, it will take more than two
years before beef supplies increase, Plain said. Calves have
nine-month gestation periods and take about 20 months to reach
slaughter weight, he said.  Tyson Outlook  Tyson Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. meat processor, projects
a “gradual reduction” of 1 percent to 2 percent in supplies of
cattle available for slaughter during the fiscal year that began
Oct. 2, according to a Nov. 21 statement. Supplies will be
“adequate” in regions where the Springdale, Arkansas-based
company operates beef plants, it said. Most of those are in the
Midwest, according to Gary Mickelson, a company spokesman.  “Cattle costs continue to go up, but so do beef prices,”
said Akshay Jagdale, a New York-based analyst at KeyBanc Capital
Markets who has a “buy” rating on Tyson. Profit margins for
meatpackers now “are actually in the red, but we expect that to
improve as the year goes along,” he said. “For the full year,
we expect them to still be profitable.”  Beef processors may have to adjust plant capacity as cattle
supplies shrink, Jagdale said in a telephone interview. Higher
beef prices will boost revenue enough to make up for the rise in
costs from shrinking supplies, he said.  As supply tightens, exports are surging. The U.S. may ship
a record 974,000 metric tons (2.15 billion pounds) of beef,
excluding variety meats, in 2012, the U.S. Meat Export
Federation said. That’s up 6.5 percent from an estimated 914,500
tons in 2011, the group said.  Consumers may pay as much as 5 percent more for beef this
year, the biggest increase among all the food groups except for
seafood, the USDA said in a Jan. 25  report . That follows an
estimated 10.2 percent rise in the cost of the meat last year,
and is projected to be higher than the 3.5 percent jump in total
food costs in 2012, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
