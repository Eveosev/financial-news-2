Greece  expects to receive advice in
about a month on how to proceed with the sale of its stakes in
the country’s two largest ports and 800 smaller harbors and
marinas, according to Andreas Taprantzis, Executive Director of
the  Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund , known as HRADF.  “We are expecting a decision from our advisers in about
four to five weeks’ time,” Taprantzis said in an interview in
Athens on Jan. 25. “We are not sure yet as to how we will
package the sale, but if you sell Piraeus Port and  Thessaloniki
Port (OLTH)  individually then this may make it harder to sell the other
ports.”  In addition to selling its 74 percent stakes this year in
the operators of the country’s two largest ports, Greece will
sell its 100 percent stakes in the smaller harbors of Volos,
Rafina, Igoumenitsa,  Patras , Alexandroupoli, Iraklio, Elefsina,
Lavrio, Corfu and Kavala.  One option would be to sell regional groups of ports;
 Piraeus Port (PPA) , near Athens, would lead a group that includes
Rafina, Elefsina and Lavrio that are all located in the
metropolitan area of the Greek capital, he said.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Piraeus Bank SA (TPEIR)  are advising on the
privatization of the 12 Greek ports, part of a plan to raise 65
billion euros ($85.5 billion) from state-asset sales and real
estate redevelopment. Greece is also selling around 800 small
ports and marinas throughout the country, Taprantzis said.  The fund, set up oversee privatizations, will start the
sale process for Greek natural gas supplier  Depa SA  and gas grid
operator Desfa by the end of this month, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
