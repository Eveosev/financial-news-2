The  Swiss National Bank  may sell the
franc “agressively” in the coming days to protect its ceiling
for the currency against the euro, Deutsche Bank AG said.  “Central bank intervention could emerge any day now given
where we are,” George Saravelos, a foreign-exchange strategist
at Deutsche Bank in London, said in an interview. “How they act
will influence the way investors think they will intervene going
forward.”  The franc traded little changed at 1.2064 per euro at 8:01
a.m. London time, approaching the cap of 1.20 set by Swiss
policy makers in September to reduce the risk of deflation and
help exporters. The Swiss currency reached 1.2474 per euro on
Oct. 19, the weakest since May.  The SNB will enforce the limit “with the utmost
determination and remains prepared to buy foreign currency in
unlimited quantities,” governing board member Jean-Pierre Danthine said at an event in Zurich on Jan. 24.  “It makes more sense to do it aggressively,” Saravelos
said. “That way they would have investors on their side,”
seeking to sell the franc in anticipation of central bank
intervention, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
