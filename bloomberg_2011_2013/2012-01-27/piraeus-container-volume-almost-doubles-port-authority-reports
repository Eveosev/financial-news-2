Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA)  (PPA),
operator of  Greece ’s largest port, said the number of containers
handled at the harbor in 2011 almost doubled from the previous
year.  The port handled just over 1.68 million so-called twenty-
foot-equivalent units last year, up from 878,083 in 2010, the
authority said in a  statement  late yesterday on its website.  Of the containers offloaded at the port in 2011, PPA
handled 500,133 at the Pier I terminal, a more than three-fold
increase from 2010, while  Piraeus Container Terminal SA , the
Greek unit of  Cosco Pacific Ltd (1199) , processed 1.18 million
containers at the port’s Pier II terminal, a rise of 73 percent,
the authority said.  Greece plans to sell its 74.5 percent stake in PPA this
year as part of a state asset sale and real-estate redevelopment
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
