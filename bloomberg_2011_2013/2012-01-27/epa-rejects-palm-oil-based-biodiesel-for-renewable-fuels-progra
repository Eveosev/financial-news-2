The Environmental Protection Agency
said that biodiesel made from  palm oil  doesn’t meet the
requirements to be added to its renewable fuels program because
its greenhouse-gas emissions are too high.  In a  regulatory  filing today, the EPA said that palm-oil
biodiesel, which is primarily produced in countries such as
Malaysia and  Indonesia , provides reductions of as much as 17
percent in greenhouse-gas emissions compared to traditional
diesel fuel, falling short of a 20 percent reduction necessary
to qualify under the law.  By failing to meet that threshold,  oil companies  can’t use
palm fuels to meet national  renewable fuel standards . Other
fuels they can use are made from soy beans, animal fat, recycled
cooking grease or similar materials.  “Our goal is to continue to diversify the already strong
portfolio of biodiesel feed stocks in the future, but we respect
the EPA’s review process and will move forward accordingly,”
Ben Evans, a spokesman for the  National Biodiesel Board , said in
an e-mail.  Environmental groups, which are locked in a fight with the
EPA over its approval of corn-based ethanol under the same
program, praised the decision as an important marker by the
agency. Palm-oil production has led to the deforestation of 6.5
million hectares (16.1 million acres) in Malaysia and Indonesia,
according to Friends of the Earth.  “A fuel that relies on deforestation for production is not
a sustainable fuel at all,” Michael Rosenoer, biofuels campaign
organizer for the group in  Washington , said in a blog post
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
