Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
head of U.S. operations, Ellen Alemany, may receive as much as
4.8 million pounds ($7.5 million) in compensation this year at
Britain’s biggest government-controlled bank.  Alemany, 56,  RBS (RBS) ’s highest-paid employee in 2010, may
receive as much as 2.3 million pounds this year as part of her
deferred share awards and options from previous years, company
filings show. She’s also paid a salary of 1.78 million pounds
and gets about 736,000 pounds toward a pension, the filings
show. The payments are subject to clawbacks and dependent on how
the business performs.  Alemany is chairman of Rhode Island-based  Citizens
Financial Group Inc. , the U.S. consumer and commercial lender
RBS bought in 1988 which generated 9 percent of revenue at the
end of 2010. The U.S. constitutes the Edinburgh-based bank’s
second-biggest market after the U.K., accounting for 22 percent
of revenue. RBS said yesterday that Hester would be paid a bonus
of 963,000 pounds after the 82 percent  government-owned  lender
was urged by Prime Minister  David Cameron  to show restraint.  Alemany earned 5.95 million pounds in total compensation
for 2010 while RBS’s head of  investment banking , John Hourican,
was the second-highest earner, at 5.93 million pounds and Nathan Bostock, the bank’s head of restructuring and risk, was next
with a package of 3.36 million pounds.  Alemany is also eligible to receive a separate bonus and
long-term share award RBS hasn’t yet disclosed what the payments
will be.  Alemany joined RBS in June 2007 from Citigroup Inc., where
she was CEO of its global transactions services business.
Alemany became chairman of Citizens in 2009, replacing Larry Fish, who helped build the unit through acquisitions including
the purchase of Cleveland-based Charter One Financial Inc. in
2004 for about $10.3 billion.  A spokeswoman for RBS declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
