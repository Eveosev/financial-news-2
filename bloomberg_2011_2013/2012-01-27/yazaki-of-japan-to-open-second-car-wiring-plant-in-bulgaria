Yazaki Corp (YAZZ) ., a Japanese maker of
automotive parts, plans to start production at a second factory
in  Bulgaria  in July.  The Tokyo-based company bought a textile factory in the
city of Sliven and is refurbishing it to produce wiring systems,
Max Lang, country manager for Yazaki’s Bulgarian unit, said in a
telephone interview from the southern town of Yambol yesterday.  “We plan to have the Sliven factory ready by the middle of
the year and start operations in July,” Lang said. “The
factory will produce wiring systems for Ford Transit vans.” He
declined to discuss financial details.  The Japanese supplier is among car-part producers including
Belgian maker of sensor chips  Melexis NV (MELE)  and French  Montupet (MON)  SA,
who’ve picked Bulgaria for its low labor costs and taxes.
Bulgaria weathered the 2009 recession without an international
bailout and kept corporate and personal income taxes at 10
percent, the lowest in the European Union.  The Sliven plant will employ 500 people by year end and
supply  Ford Motor Co. (F) , Lang said. Headcount at the plant may
reach 1,300 by the end of 2013, he added.  Yazaki has operated since 2006 another wiring factory in
Yambol near the Turkish border that employs 2,100 people and
supplies  Renault SA (RNO) ,  Lang said. The company closed one of its
two factories in Slovakia in 2010, cutting 1,200 jobs, as the
global crisis cut demand for car components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
