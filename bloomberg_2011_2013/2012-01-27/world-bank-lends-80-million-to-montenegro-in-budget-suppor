The  World Bank  will lend Montenegro
$80 million as part of a development policy lending vehicle, to
help its budget this year.  Montenegro will repay the loan over 20 years, including a
five-year grace period, at an  interest rate  of 0.80 percent
above the six-month EURIBOR, which currently totals 2.7 percent,
the Finance Ministry, based in Montenegroâ€™s capital Podgorica,
said in an e-mail today.  The government expects World Bank lending to help improve
long-term sustainability of public finances, lower the average
interest rate the country pays on its debt and expand the
average debt servicing period, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
