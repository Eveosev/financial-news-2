Russia’s needs to elect Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  to implement the reforms the economy
needs to flourish, said Dmitry Pumpyansky, majority owner of
pipe producer OAO TMK.  “We do not need a revolution,” Pumpyansky said in an
interview in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday. The government needs
to pay more attention to strategic planning and to regional
development, he said.  Russia will hold a presidential election March 4. Putin’s
challengers include billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, Communist
Party head Gennady Zyuganov, Just Russia’s Sergey Mironov and
the Liberal Democratic Party’s  Vladimir Zhirinovsky .  To contact the reporter on this story:
