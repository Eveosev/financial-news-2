Opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government broke into  Syria ’s embassy in Cairo today,
Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Attackers pulled down the embassy’s front sign, according
to the news service. The embassy was the target of similar
vandalism before it was relocated, Mena said.  At least 200 people broke the embassy’s doors and windows
before being pushed back by Egyptian security forces,  Agence
France-Presse  reported earlier today. The building was empty at
the time and no arrests have been reported in connection with
the incident, AFP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
