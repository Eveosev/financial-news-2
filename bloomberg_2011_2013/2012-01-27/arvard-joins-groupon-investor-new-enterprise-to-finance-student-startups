Harvard University  joined with New
Enterprise Associates, the first outside investor in  Groupon
Inc. (GRPN) , to start a seed-stage venture fund for financing student
startups and investing on the U.S. East Coast.  The  Experiment Fund , starting today in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, will invest as much as $250,000 each in ventures
focused on information, health care and energy technologies,
according to an e-mailed statement today. The fund’s size wasn’t
disclosed, nor were details of the participation by Harvard or
New Enterprise. The university is the world’s richest.  Investments will be targeted at students who studied in
Cambridge, where  Harvard  is also based, or at technologies that
were developed there. Harvard will designate faculty members
from its School of Engineering & Applied Sciences to advise
student entrepreneurs about the fund and related resources. The
Experiment Fund will function independently of the university,
according to the statement.  New Enterprise Associates , founded in the late 1970s, is
one of the nation’s biggest venture capital firms and has
offices in Menlo Park,  California , and the Washington, D.C.,
region as well as overseas. The company owns a 14 percent  stake 
in Chicago-based Groupon, valued at about $1.7 billion,
resulting from an early $4.8 million investment in the daily-
deal site.  Experiment Fund “eventually” will involve more investors
and advisers, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
