Iceland’s annual inflation
accelerated at the fastest pace in 20 months, putting pressure
on the  central bank  to raise  interest rates .  The inflation rate jumped in January to 6.5 percent from
5.3 percent in December, Reykjavik-based Statistics Iceland said
in a statement on its  website  today. Consumer prices rose 0.3
percent on the month.  The  central bank  last month kept rates unchanged after
having raised the benchmark twice in 2011, as the country
emerged from its financial collapse in 2008. Inflation has
picked up as the krona loses ground against the euro following
steps by the central bank to ease currency controls. The krona
slipped 2.3 percent versus Europe’s single currency since Jan.
6. Policy makers raised rates a quarter point to 4.75 percent on
Nov. 2 to shield the krona from market turbulence fueled by
 Europe ’s deepening debt crisis.  The bank targets annual price growth of 2.5 percent.
Iceland’s economy grew at the fastest pace since the second
quarter of 2007 in the three months through September, the
statistics office said on Dec. 7. Gross domestic product
expanded a quarterly 4.7 percent, after shrinking 3.6 percent in
the previous period, the office said then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
