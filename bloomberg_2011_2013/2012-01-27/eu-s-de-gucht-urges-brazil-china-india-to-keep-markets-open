European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel De Gucht urged  China , Brazil and  India  to keep their
markets open as the global economic crisis tempts governments to
prop up domestic companies using protectionist measures.  “There is much more protectionism that commonly
realized,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview today in
Davos, Switzerland. “If it continues, there will be more
protectionism with more local champions” and this will cause
trade to shrink.  “If we do not take measure to keep world markets open,
they are going to close,” De Gucht said. “It will get worse
unless there is a fierce reaction” and nations such as China,
India and Brazil “should realize they cannot prosper in a world
where there is more protectionism.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
