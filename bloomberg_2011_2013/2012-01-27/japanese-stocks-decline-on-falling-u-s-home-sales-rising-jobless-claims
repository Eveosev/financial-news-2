Japanese stocks  fell for a second
day as the yen strengthened even after Prime Minister  Yoshihiko
Noda  pressed the central bank for “bold” action to counter the
currency’s gain. Energy companies and trading houses gained as
commodity prices climbed.  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer electronics maker that gets about 70
percent of its sales abroad, slid 1.4 percent.  Nintendo Co. (7974)  sank
4.1 percent after the video-game console maker tripled its loss
forecast. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s top
lender by market value, lost 1.4 percent, after U.S. banking
stocks dropped on the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep rates
near zero through 2014.  Mitsui & Co. , which counts commodities
as its biggest source of profit, rose 2.1 percent as crude and
metals prices gained.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.1 percent to 8,841.22
at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , with a weekly gain of 0.9 percent.
The broader  Topix (TPX)  slipped 0.5 percent to 761.13, with about
three shares dropping for every two that gained.  “The yen just keeps getting stronger and it’s hurting
Japanese stocks,” said Tomoichiro Kubota, a market analyst at
Matsui Securities Co. “With the Fed saying they’ll keep zero
rates for a long time and Europe facing all of these government
bond redemptions, the concern has been reignited that the yen
will keep rising.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  lost 0.3 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday after
U.S. new home sales unexpectedly fell and jobless claims climbed.  Banking Shares Drop  Banking shares slid yesterday in New York after the Federal
Reserve’s pledge to keep  interest rates  at a record low for
longer than originally forecast, spurring investors to seek
higher yields.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (8306)  slipped 1.4 percent to 351
yen. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., Japan’s third-biggest bank by
market value, lost 1.7 percent to 115 yen.  Japanese equities slumped after the yen extended gains even
after Noda called on the  Bank of Japan  to take more aggressive
steps to stem the currency’s increase and deflation.  The yen appreciated as much as 76.90 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 77.63 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. The yen also strengthened to 100.77 against
the euro from 101.89, cutting the value of income at some
exporters.  Exporters Fall  Sony fell 1.4 percent to 1,414 yen.  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an
electronic equipment manufacturer that earns most of its revenue
abroad, lost 2.1 percent to 6,500 yen.  Nintendo sank 4.1 percent to 10,310 yen after more than
tripling its loss forecast to 65 billion yen ($844 million) for
the fiscal year ending March. Sales of its 3DS handheld player
have been sapped by rising demand for Apple Inc. gadgets such as
the iPhone and iPad.  Energy companies and trading houses advanced the most in
the 33 Topix industry groups. Mitsui & Co. rose 2.1 percent to
1,299 yen while  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  gained 2.3 percent to 1,757 yen.
Inpex Corp., Japan’s top oil explorer, added 2.9 percent to
528,000 yen, while Japan Drilling Co., an offshore exploration
contractor, increased 1.9 percent to 2,536 yen.  Copper rose to a four-month high in New York yesterday. The
London Metal Exchange Index gained 2.4 percent, the biggest rise
since Jan. 10. Crude oil for March delivery added 0.3 percent to
$99.70 a barrel yesterday in New York, the highest settlement
since Jan. 19.  “The whole world is moving toward monetary easing,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $35 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Europe and the U.S. are
injecting a lot of liquidity, and that’s boosting commodities.”  The  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 19 percent last year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value. That compares with 2.2 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 1.4 times for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
