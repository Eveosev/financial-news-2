Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. won the
World Cup ski season’s first women’s super-combined event to
extend her lead in the overall standings.  Vonn, 27, had a total time of 2 minutes, 28.35 seconds in
the downhill and slalom stages in St. Moritz, Switzerland, 0.41
seconds faster than Slovenia’s Tina Maze. Austria’s Nicole Hosp
was third, 0.58 seconds behind the American.  Vonn, who won the super-combined title the past two
seasons, held a 1.41-second lead after the opening downhill run
and her sixth-place finish in the slalom was enough to secure
her 48th World Cup victory.  The 100-point win moves Vonn  302 points  ahead of Maze in
the overall standings. She also leads the super-G and downhill
standings.  Maria Hoefl-Riesch of  Germany , the defending overall
champion, finished in 21st place and is sixth in the standings,
554 points behind the leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
