The zloty strengthened against the
euro, headed for its third weekly gain, as a report showed the
European Unionâ€™s largest eastern economy expanded last year at
the fastest pace since 2008.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.4 percent to 4.2143
per euro, its strongest in 4 1/2 months, before paring gains to
0.3 percent at 4.2184 by 10:46 a.m. in Warsaw. It has advanced
2.2 percent this week and 5.9 percent since the end of last
year.  Gross domestic product increased 4.3 percent in 2011
compared with a revised 3.9 percent a year earlier, the
statistics office in Warsaw said today. That exceeded the median
estimate of 4.2 percent from 27 economists polled by Bloomberg
and was the fastest annual pace since GDP rose 5.1 percent in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
