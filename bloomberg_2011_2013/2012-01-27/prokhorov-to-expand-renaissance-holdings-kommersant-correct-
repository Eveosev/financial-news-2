(Corrects second paragraph to say debts owed to investment
bank and beneficiaries in story initially published Jan. 26.)  Billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov will
expand his holdings in Renaissance Group, a Moscow-based bank
that invests in  emerging markets , to include 30 percent of its
retail arm Renaissance Credit,  Kommersant  reported, citing
unidentified market participants.  Prokhorov owns 50 percent of  Renaissance Capital , the
