Mexico ’s recent peso appreciation
will help keep inflation within a range of 3 percent to 4
percent this year, central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said.  “Core inflation is very near our objective of 3 percent,”
Carstens told reporters today at the  World Economic Forum  in
Davos, Switzerland. “In general, the performance of inflation
has been adequate.” Price growth should “slowly converge to 3
percent in the medium term.”  Carstens said the central bank was “comfortable” with
current monetary policy stance, and that it was watching the
cost of agricultural products carefully. It is also monitoring
international financial markets and “the relative monetary
policy stance of Mexico versus other countries.”  Mexico´s economy will grow at least 3.5 percent this year,
driven by strong domestic spending, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
