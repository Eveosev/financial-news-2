Alan Krueger, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, said the  U.S. economy ’s 2.8
percent growth rate in the fourth quarter is “encouraging,”
though more improvement is needed.  “While the continued expansion is encouraging, faster
growth is needed to replace the jobs lost in the recent downturn
and to reduce long-term unemployment,” Krueger said in a
statement issued by the White House.  The U.S. economy expanded less than forecast in the fourth
quarter as consumers curbed spending and government agencies cut
back, according to Commerce Department figures released today.
Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, climbed at a 2.8 percent annual pace following a 1.8
percent gain in the prior quarter. The median forecast of 79
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 3 percent
increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
