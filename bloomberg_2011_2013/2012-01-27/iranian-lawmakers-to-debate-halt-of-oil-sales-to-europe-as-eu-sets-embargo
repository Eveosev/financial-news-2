Iranian lawmakers will debate a bill
requiring an immediate halt of  Iran ’s oil exports to Europe, the
state-run  Fars  news agency said, in a response to a European
Union ban on importing on Iranian crude that is to start in
July.  “On Sunday, the parliament will have to approve a ‘double
emergency’ bill calling for a halt in the export of Iranian oil
to Europe starting next week,” Fars quoted the vice-chairman of
the parliament’s National Security and Foreign Policy
Commission, Hossein Ibrahimi, as saying today.  The EU agreed on Jan. 23 to ban oil imports from Iran from
July 1 as part of measures to ratchet up pressure on the
country’s nuclear program. Iran’s Oil Ministry has played down
the effects of the measure on its economy, saying the move may
lead to “heavy economic loss and damages” for  Europe  and that
it has “no concerns” about finding new customers.  Europe, collectively the second-biggest buyer of Iranian
oil after  China , imported 450,000 barrels a day of the nation’s
crude in the first half of last year, U.S. Energy Department
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
