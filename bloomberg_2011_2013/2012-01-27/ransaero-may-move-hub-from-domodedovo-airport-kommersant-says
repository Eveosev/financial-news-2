OAO Transaero Airlines,  Russia ’s
second-largest carrier, may move its Moscow hub from Domodedovo,
the largest airport in Eastern Europe, to Vnukovo,  Kommersant 
reported, citing an unidentified person with knowledge of the
industry.  Transaero may begin around 20 daily flights at Vnukovo this
spring, two people told the Moscow-based newspaper. The airline
could move its base of operations to Vnukovo this fall, said a
different person cited by Kommersant.  Domodedovo’s owners are now accepting bids for the sale of
the airport until March 1, after initially setting the deadline
for bids on Feb. 7, Kommersant reported. The owners want around
$5.5 billion and the highest bids have been around $3.5 billion,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
