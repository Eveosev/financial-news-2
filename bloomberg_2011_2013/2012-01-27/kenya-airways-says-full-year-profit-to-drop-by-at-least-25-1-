Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-largest airline, said its annual profit will fall
at least 25 percent after the European debt crisis, rising fuel
prices and political unrest in Egypt and Nigeria curbed revenue.  “Despite these challenges that are affecting the entire
aviation industry, the board of directors expects that Kenya
Airways will remain profitable,” the Nairobi-based company said
in a stock exchange statement today.  Kenya Airways shares have fallen 37 percent since the start
of its financial year on April 1, compared with a 26 percent
drop in the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-Share Index. The
carrier closed unchanged at 20.25 shillings in Nairobi today.  For the six months through September, Kenya Airways
reported net income 41 percent higher at 2.03 billion shillings
($23.9 million).  Air France-KLM (AF) ,  Europe ’s largest airline, owns 26 percent
of Kenya Airways, while the Kenyan government holds 23 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
