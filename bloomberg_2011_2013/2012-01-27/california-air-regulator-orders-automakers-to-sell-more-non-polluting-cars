California will require automakers
to sell millions of “zero emission” vehicles -- battery-
electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered -- setting new
standards followed by states from  New York  to  Oregon .  The rules adopted today by the California Air Resources
Board mean manufacturers will have to produce about 1.4 million
advanced vehicles for sale in that state alone by 2025, more
than 40 times the number on the road from 1996 through 2010,
according to a state analysis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
