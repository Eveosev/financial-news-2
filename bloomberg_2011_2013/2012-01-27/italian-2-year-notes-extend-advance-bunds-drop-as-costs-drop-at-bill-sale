Italian two-year notes extended an
advance after borrowing costs fell as the nation sold 11 billion
euros of 182- and 331-day bills.  Italyâ€™s two-year note yield dropped six basis points to
3.53 percent at 10:17 a.m. London time.  The Italian 10-year bond yield fell seven basis points to
5.98 percent. German bunds of a similar maturity declined,
pushing the yield up one basis point to 1.88 percent.  Italy sold the six-month securities at the  lowest  average
yield since May 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
