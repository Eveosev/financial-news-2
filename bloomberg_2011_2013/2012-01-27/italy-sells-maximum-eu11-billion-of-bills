Italy  sold 11 billion euros ($14.5
billion) of Treasury bills today, meeting its target, and
borrowing costs plunged from the previous sale.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8 billion euros of 182-day
bills at 1.969 percent, the lowest since May and down from 3.251
percent at the last auction of similar-maturity securities on
Dec. 28. Investors bid for 1.35 times the amount offered, down
from 1.69 times last month. The Treasury also sold 3 billion
euros of 331-day bills at a rate of 2.214 percent.  “Bond auctions in Italy are no longer nerve-wracking
affairs,” Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign
Strategy in  London , said by e-mail. “The risks of a sharp sell-
off in Italy’s debt market have fallen significantly of late.”  Italy has benefited from the  European Central Bank ’s
efforts to fight the spread of the debt crisis by shoring up
banks and propping up demand for  government bonds . The
Frankfurt-based ECB loaned euro-region banks a record 489
billion euros for three years on Dec. 21 to avert a credit
crunch and has bought 217 billion euros of government bonds
since beginning the purchases in May.  Italy’s 10-year yield was 5.96 percent at 11:11 a.m. Rome
time, falling 9 basis points from yesterday.  Today’s sale comes after the Treasury auctioned 5 billion
euros of inflation-linked and zero-coupon bonds yesterday, the
maximum for the sale. The Treasury is rushing to raise funds to
pay for 25.8 billion euros of maturing bonds on Feb. 1 and needs
to sell about 450 billion euros of bonds and bills this year to
cover redemptions and finance the deficit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
