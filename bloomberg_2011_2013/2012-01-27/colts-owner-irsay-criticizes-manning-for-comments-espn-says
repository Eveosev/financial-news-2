Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay
criticized quarterback  Peyton Manning  for complaining about the
dour atmosphere on the team, saying he should have kept his
opinions “in the family,”  ESPN reported  on its website.  Manning’s comments followed a 2-14 season, the team’s worst
in 20 years, and several firings, including coach Jim Caldwell
and vice chairman  Bill Polian . They came six weeks before Irsay
has to decide whether to pay the four-time National Football
League Most Valuable Player, who did not play this season while
recovering from neck surgery, a $28 million bonus or risk losing
him as a free agent, ESPN said.  “If you got a problem, you talk to each other, it’s not
about campaigning or anything like that,” Irsay told reporters,
according to ESPN.  Manning told The Indianapolis Star that he had “reached
out” to Irsay following their exchange, ESPN said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
