The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose
for a fourth week, the longest streak since October, as the
 Federal Reserve ’s plans to keep  interest rates  low through at
least late 2014 offset slower-than-forecast economic growth.  The S&P 500 trimmed its gain in the last two days of the
week, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  erased its advance,
after reports on new home sales and U.S. gross domestic product
trailed economists’ estimates. Commodity, technology and
industrial stocks had the biggest gains among 10 groups.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  increased at least 5.3 percent
and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  rallied 23 percent after reporting earnings
that topped analysts’ estimates.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,316.33 this week to
extend its 2012 gain to 4.7 percent, poised for its best January
since 1997. The Dow, which climbed above its highest closing
level since May 2008 during the week, retreated 60.02 points, or
0.5 percent, to 12,660.46.  “Everybody cheered” the announcement from the Fed,  Mark Freeman , co-chief investment officer at Westwood Management
Corp. in  Dallas , said in a telephone interview. His firm
oversees about $12 billion. “In an environment where the Fed’s
going to continue to maintain negative real rates, growth in
income will continue to be front and center for investors,” he
said. “Investors are sitting back and, after the economic data,
saying, ‘Wait a minute, let’s not get too carried away here.’”  20 Percent Rebound  The  S&P 500  has jumped almost 20 percent from its 2011 low
in October amid optimism that the U.S. economy will withstand
Europe’s debt crisis. The index’s  50-day moving average  is 0.2
percent away from exceeding the average price for the prior 200
days. The formation, known as a “golden cross,” will occur for
the first time since 2010 and is historically a signal that more
gains are likely to follow, Birinyi Associates Inc. said.  The S&P 500 climbed to its  highest level  since July on Jan.
25 after the Fed extended its commitment to keep interest rates
low through at least late 2014 and Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
signaled that central bankers haven’t ruled out additional asset
purchases.  Stocks  trimmed  their weekly advance on Jan. 26 after a
report showed that sales of new U.S. homes unexpectedly declined
in December, capping the slowest year on record for builders.
Stocks fell again the next day after the Commerce Department
said the  U.S. economy  expanded at a 2.8 percent annual rate,
trailing the median forecast of 79 economists for a 3 percent
increase.  ‘Strong Run’  “On the surface, if you were looking for 3 percent and you
only get 2.8 percent, that’s probably the overall
disappointment,” Thomas Nyheim, a Greenville, Delaware-based
money manager for Christiana Trust, which oversees $9.2 billion,
said in a telephone interview. “The market has already had a
good, strong run year-to-date, so we might be just pausing for
the day.”  Earnings reports have been “hitting expectations,
or slightly above,” he said.  Companies from Apple to Newell Rubbermaid Inc. topped
analysts’ income projections this week. Earnings-per-share have
topped analysts’  estimates  at 66 percent of the 169 companies in
the S&P 500 that  reported results  since Jan. 9, Bloomberg data
show.  Apple at Record  Apple jumped 6.4 percent to an all-time high of $447.28
this week after reporting record quarterly sales and profit,
topping analysts’ estimates, as holiday purchases of the new
iPhone helped the company steer clear of a consumer spending
slump. Fiscal first-quarter earnings were $13.87 a share
compared with the average estimate of $10.14. Sales climbed 73
percent to $46.3 billion.  Apple single-handedly erased a drop in S&P 500 earnings for
the December quarter. Excluding Apple’s Jan. 24 results,
earnings had declined 4.2 percent for the other companies that
had reported.  Investors this week bought shares of companies most-tied to
the economy on signs the Fed was committed to safeguarding
growth. Raw-material producers gained the most out of  10 groups 
in the S&P 500, rising 1.5 percent. Technology and industrial
stocks rose 1 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.  Earnings Season  Caterpillar, the world’s biggest maker of construction and
mining-equipment, posted fourth-quarter profit that beat
 analysts’ estimates  and signaled Wall Street projections for
this year were too conservative, bolstering expectations the
world economy will escape a recession. Fourth-quarter net income
rose to $2.32 a share. The average of 21 analysts’ estimates was
$1.73 a share. Shares climbed 5.3 percent to $111.28.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  jumped 3.1 percent to $7.29, the
second-biggest advance in the Dow. The second-largest U.S.
lender by assets may reduce annual costs by as much as an
additional $3 billion, Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
told employees.  DuPont Co. (DD)  climbed 2.6 percent to $50.72. The most-valuable
U.S. chemical maker posted fourth-quarter profit that exceeded
analysts’ estimates as higher prices for titanium-dioxide
pigment and other products offset falling sales volumes.  Netflix rallied the  most in the S&P 500 , rising 23 percent
to $123.79. The online and mail-order video-rental service said
it contained a subscriber revolt in the fourth quarter and
forecast improving margins for its streaming business.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  climbed 18 percent to $45.54 for the
second-biggest gain in the  S&P 500 . Solar shares gained as chief
executive officers from Suntech Power Holdings Co. and Trina
Solar Ltd. said  China  may double its installations of solar
panels this year, absorbing excess production that depressed
prices and margins in 2011.  Verizon, Banks Slip  Telephone companies had the  biggest decline  this week in
the S&P 500, falling 4.3 percent.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
lost 4.5 percent to $37.21 as the second-largest U.S. phone
company reported a fourth-quarter loss after booking a pension
charge and having higher subsidy costs for rising iPhone sales.
 AT&T Inc. (T) , the largest U.S. phone company, erased 4.4 percent to
$29.16 after predicting 2012 earnings that trailed analysts’
estimates.  Banks in the  S&P 500  slipped 2.6 percent as a group, with
Wells Fargo & Co. losing 3.1 percent to $29.60 to pace declines,
on concern the Fed’s plan to extend the duration of record-low
interest rates will diminish the profitability from lending.  Barton Biggs , who increased bets on U.S. equities before
the  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rallied last month, said he remains bullish
even amid concerns over  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “I’m terrified I’m not long enough if we’re going to have
a strong rally here, which we could,” he said during an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” on Jan. 23.
Biggs said his net-long position in equities is 65 percent. At
the same time, “I’m terrified I’m too long if the apocalypse is
coming in Europe,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
