Turkish authorities are working to
support the development of long-term financing in the lira
currency, central bank Governor Erdem Basci said.  Promoting a local corporate  bond market  is a priority,
Basci said today in an interview with Bloomberg Television from
Davos,  Switzerland .  Turkey ’s  foreign currency reserves  have declined by more
than $18 billion from a peak of $94 billion in July last year as
the bank sold dollars to stabilize the lira. The currency
depreciated 18 percent against the dollar last year, the most
among emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The exposure of some Turkish companies to borrowing in
foreign currencies means that the central bank can’t ignore the
exchange rate, Basci said yesterday in Davos. As long as the
economy is partly dollarized and companies depend on lending in
foreign currencies, central banks need to have some role in
managing the  exchange rate , he said.  The bulk of the dollars the central bank has sold went to
local companies and individuals, Basci said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
