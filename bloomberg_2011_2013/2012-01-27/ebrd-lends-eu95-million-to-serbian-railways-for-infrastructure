The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development approved a 95 million euro ($124.5 million) loan
to Zeleznice Srbije,  Serbia ’s state-run railway company, to help
it improve the country’s railroads.  The 15-year loan with a three-year grace period, will help
rebuild a total of 64 kilometers (40 miles) of tracks, including
14 kilometers near the capital Belgrade, the London-based lender
said in an e-mailed statement. The international rail route
passing through Serbia, handles more than a half of all rail
traffic in the Balkan country.  Much of the country’s rail tracks are “in a poor state,”
causing speed restrictions to less than 60 kilometers per hour
in some sections, the EBRD said. The bank extended an additional
1.5 million-euro grant to support a further overhaul of the
company and reduce state monopoly of railway services.  The EBRD has provided in previous years 317 million euros
to  Zeleznice Srbije  for upgrading the rolling stock and the
infrastructure. The government split the company last year into
four units that handle passenger traffic, cargo, infrastructure
and asset-management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
