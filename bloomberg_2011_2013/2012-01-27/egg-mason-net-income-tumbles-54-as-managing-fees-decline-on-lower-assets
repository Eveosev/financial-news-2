Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the Baltimore-based
 money manager  with 17 straight quarters of redemptions, said
fiscal third-quarter profit declined 54 percent as assets fell,
lowering fees for managing investors’ money.  Net income dropped to $28.1 million, or 20 cents a share,
in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $61.6 million, or 41
cents, a year earlier, the Baltimore-based firm said today in a
statement. Profit missed the $42.1 million average  estimate  of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, sending the firm’s shares
down as much as 7.9 percent, the most since Oct. 3.  Legg Mason reported $42 million in costs related to
restructuring and $1.7 million in compensation expenses fueled
by market gains. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Fetting  has cut
jobs to increase profitability and improved performance at fund
units as he seeks to end redemptions that started after returns
trailed peers in 2007 and 2008.  “I think the turnaround in terms of the flows is a bit
ahead of the turnaround from an earnings perspective,” said
 Michael Kim , an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New
York. “Clearly last quarter was impacted by a sizable
restructuring charge.”  Shares Fall  Legg Mason fell 4.8 percent to $26.02 at the close in New
York, after earlier declining to  $25.16 . The stock has declined
23 percent in the past 12 months, compared with the 19 percent
 drop  in the Standard & Poor’s 20-member index of custody banks
and asset managers.  Clients pulled a net $1.3 billion during the quarter,
including $7.1 billion from bond funds and $4.9 billion from
stocks. Investors put $10.7 billion into Legg Mason’s money
funds during the quarter.  Assets fell 6.7 percent from a year earlier to $627
billion, while rising from the previous quarter because of $17.6
billion in market gains. During the quarter, Legg Mason’s stock
funds, which earn higher fees, rose 5.8 percent to $153.3
billion, while bond fund assets fell 0.8 percent to $352.6
billion, the firm said. Money-fund assets rose 8.7 percent in
the quarter to $121.1 billion.  Revenue earned for managing investor funds dropped 13
percent to $627 million, as performance fees for beating certain
benchmarks declined 82 percent to $6.1 million compared with a
year earlier.  ‘Challenging Quarter’  “It was a challenging quarter in the markets and you
really have to link what happened in the past six months with
the U.S. sovereign downgrade,” Fetting said in an interview.  Still, Legg Mason’s redemptions eased in the quarter at
performance at investment units such as  Western Asset  improved,
according to Fetting. The redemptions were the lowest since the
third quarter of 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Peter Nachtwey, Legg Mason’s chief financial officer, said
during a conference call today with analysts and investors that
he expected to see earnings of 42 cents to 52 cents for the
fiscal fourth quarter, probably in the “mid-to-lower end of
that range.”  S&P lowered its earnings-per-share estimate for the 2012
fiscal year to $1.43 from $1.66, and cut Legg Mason’s target
share price by $2 to $27. S&P kept its “hold” rating on the
shares.  The MSCI ACWI Index of global stocks declined  6.2 percent 
in the past 12 months while the  S&P 500 Index  gained 1.3
percent. Investors pulled about $130 billion from U.S.-
registered equity funds in 2011, while depositing about $130
billion into bond funds, according to estimates from the
 Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade
association.  Bill Miller , famous for beating the S&P 500 Index for a
record 15 years through 2005, said in November he would step
down as manager of Legg Mason Capital Management Value Trust
after trailing the index in four out of five years since 2005.
The fund declined 4 percent last year, trailing 53 percent of
its peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
