Citgo Petroleum Corp.,  Valero Energy
Corp. (VLO)  and Flint Hills Resources LLC are probably looking at
expanding the crude capacity at their refineries in  Texas  that
can access Eagle Ford crude, said Bob Kent, vice president of
refining at Citgo.  “All these refiners are rumored to be in various stages of
looking at expansions, additional crude capacity,” said Kent
during a presentation at the Argus Americas Crude Summit in
Houston. “I’d be fairly certain that all three companies are
looking very seriously at it.”  Bill Day, a spokesman for Valero in  San Antonio , said the
company has “definitely” increased the amount of Eagle Ford
crude being processed at its Three Rivers and  Corpus Christi 
plants and has processed some at the Houston refinery.  “We haven’t necessarily expanded crude capacity, but we
have expanded the gathering systems that bring Eagle Ford to our
refineries,” Day said in an e-mail response to questions.  NuStar Energy LP (NS)  has agreed to modify and build pipeline
sections to transport Eagle Ford and other crude oils to Valero
refineries, according to a Sept. 7 statement.  Flint Hills is considering an expansion of its Corpus
Christi plant, though there are no “firm plans” to do so,
Katie Stavinoha, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “Flint Hills Resources has increased the amount of Eagle
Ford domestic crude oil it processes in Corpus Christi
substantially in the past year,” she said.  The refinery can process 305,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
