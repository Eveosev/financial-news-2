Tohoku Electric Power Co. (9506) , the power
supplier to areas most devastated by  Japan ’s earthquake and
tsunami last year, forecast a record annual loss because of
higher fuel costs and charges for repairing grids and stations.  Tohoku Electric expects a loss of 250 billion yen ($3.2
billion), it said in a statement. It’s the biggest loss in the
Sendai, northern Japan-based company’s history, spokesman Hiroki
Enami said by phone today. The company had a 33.7 billion yen
loss the previous year.  The magnitude-9 quake and tsunami that struck the Tohoku
region on March 11 killed at least  15,800 people  and destroyed
about 130,000 houses and buildings, according to the  National
Police Agency . In addition to a decline in electricity demand in
the devastated areas, the utility had to fix damaged plants,
grids and other equipment and pay higher fossil fuel bills as
its nuclear stations remain closed since the disaster.  Tohoku Electric reported a loss of 167.7 billion yen for
the nine months to Dec. 31, compared with a 50.8 billion yen
profit a year earlier, it said. The company’s electricity sales
for the period fell 13.1 percent to 53 billion kilowatt-hours
from a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
