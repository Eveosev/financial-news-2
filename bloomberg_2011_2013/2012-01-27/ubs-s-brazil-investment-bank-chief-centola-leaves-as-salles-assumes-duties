UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
said that Eduardo Centola, head of  investment banking  in Brazil,
has left after 15 months at the firm.  Lywal Salles, chairman and chief executive officer of the
bank’s business in Brazil, will assume Centola’s duties on an
interim basis, Zurich-based UBS said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. UBS didn’t give a reason for the departure.  Centola, 42, joined UBS in October 2010 from Standard Bank
Group Ltd., where he was CEO for the Americas. He is a former
managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  “We wish him continuing success in his career,” Robert McCann, UBS’s CEO for the Americas, said in the statement. The
firm said it’s committed to building an integrated bank in
Brazil with a “strong, local” investment-banking unit.  Centola didn’t respond to messages seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
