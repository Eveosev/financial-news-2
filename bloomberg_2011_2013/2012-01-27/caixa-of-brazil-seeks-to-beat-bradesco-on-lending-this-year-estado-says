Caixa Economica Federal (CEFN3)  plans to
increase lending to as much as 290 billion reais ($166 billion)
this year to become Brazil’s third-biggest lender, O Estado de
S. Paulo reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Jorge Hereda.  The state-controlled bank, which had a credit portfolio of
227 billion reais in September, would need to beat  Banco
Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  to occupy third place, according to the newspaper.
Bradesco’s credit portfolio totaled 229.3 billion reais in
September, O Estado said.  Caixa is revising the fees and interest rates on its home
loans following a request by Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega , as Brazil’s government seeks to ease credit to
stimulate growth, O Estado said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
