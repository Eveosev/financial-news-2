What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that adverse
weather this month reduced output in South America,  Don Roose ,
the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in telephone interview. Farmers withheld inventories,
boosting premiums that grain companies are paying to acquire
prompt supplies.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that protective snow cover and
moderating temperatures next week will limit damage to crops in
parts of Russia and Ukraine, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent
higher in Chicago amid forecasts for beneficial rain in the next
two weeks in  South America  and speculation that  China  will
increase purchases next week, Roose said.  Soybean-oil  futures
are expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.15 cent a pound lower, and
soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1 lower per 2,000
pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
