Procter & Gamble Co. , the world’s
largest consumer-products company, reduced its full-year
earnings forecast as the strength in the  U.S. dollar  hurts sales
generated abroad.  Adjusted earnings per share for 2012 will be as much as
$4.10, compared with a previous projection of a maximum of
$4.33, the Cincinnati-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had projected $4.17 a share, the average of 21
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  P&G’s forecast follows rival  Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) , which
also this week projected full-year earnings that trailed
analysts’ estimates, citing a foreign currency “headwind” and
difficult economic conditions. Household-products makers are
facing lower birthrates and U.S. consumers pinched by a housing
slump and unemployment that averaged 9 percent last year.  P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers and Gillette razors,  fell 
0.8 percent to $64.30 at the close in  New York . The shares rose
3.7 percent last year.  Strength in the dollar will hurt the value of revenue
generated overseas when it’s converted to U.S. currency. The
company said sales from developing markets are expected to make
up 37 percent of revenue this year, up from 35 percent in 2011.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, has gained 6.3
percent since the end of August.  Increased Prices  Chief Executive Officer  Robert McDonald  said on a media
conference call today that the company’s increased prices hurt
market share last quarter. P&G has been raising prices across
all divisions and regions to help make up for higher costs for
commodities, which McDonald said will have “easier”
comparisons in the next two quarters.  Net income in the fiscal second quarter declined 49 percent
to $1.69 billion, or 57 cents a share, from $3.33 billion, or
$1.11, a year earlier, the company said. P&G incurred a non-cash
expense of $1.5 billion, or 50 cents a share, to adjust the
carrying value of goodwill in its Appliances and Salon business,
according to the statement.  Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.10, the company
said. Analysts projected $1.08 a share, excluding some costs,
the average of 19  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose
3.7 percent to $22.1 billion.  Newell Results  Newell Rubbermaid Inc. (NWL)  also said foreign exchange will
restrain 2012 profit. Currency effects will trim 4 to 5 cents a
share from profits this year, Chief Executive Officer Mike Polk
said on a conference call today.  Newell, based in Atlanta, said fourth-quarter net income
rose to $80.4 million, or 27 cents a share, from $75.7 million,
or 25 cents, a year earlier, according to a statement today.
Excluding a 12-cent charge for restructuring in  Europe , Newell
earned 40 cents a share, beating the average Bloomberg estimate
of 38 cents.  The company forecast 2012 adjusted profit of $1.63 to $1.69
a share. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected $1.69, the
average of 11 estimates.  Newell rose 8 percent, the most in three months, to $18.82
at the close in New York.  Newell’s baby and parenting unit posted a 4.5 percent sales
gain, led by a 20 percent increase in  Asia  and demand for its
high-end Aprica brand there, Polk said today in a telephone
interview. Sales for the unit fell 12 percent in the first half
of last year, hurt by low birthrates, he said. Polk joined the
company in July from Unilever NV.  “It’s too early to say” whether  consumer spending  will
pick up in the U.S., Polk said, leading him to be conservative
with the company’s planning. More than two-thirds of Newell’s
sales came from the U.S. in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
