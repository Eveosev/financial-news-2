Norway-born shipping billionaire
 John Fredriksen  is planning to order ten oil-product tankers
worth a total of $330 million,  TradeWinds  reported, citing an
interview with him.  The contract will be signed within weeks at one of several
South Korean yards competing for the business, according to a
report in the shipping newspaper today.  Prices for the medium-range tankers to be ordered are at
the lowest in 10 to 15 years, Fredriksen said, according to the
report. Medium-range tankers have a capacity to ship about
38,000 metric tons of oil products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
