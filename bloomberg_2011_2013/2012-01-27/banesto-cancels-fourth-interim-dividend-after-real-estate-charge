Banco Espanol de Credito SA , a
Spanish consumer banking unit of  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , canceled
its final dividend of the year, citing a charge for bad real-
estate loans taken earlier this month.  Banesto, as the bank is known, won’t be able to propose a
fourth interim dividend at the next  shareholders’ meeting ,
according to a spokesman who declined to be named, citing
company policy. Earlier today, a statement from the lender said
it would pay a total of 123.7 million euros ($163 million) for
the first three quarterly dividends, including the upcoming Feb.
1 payment.  The bank said on Jan. 12 that it took a 280-million-euro
charge to account for Spain’s deteriorating property market.
Banesto is scaling back lending and setting aside funds to cover
damaged assets as  Spain ’s government pressures banks to clean up
their balance sheets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
