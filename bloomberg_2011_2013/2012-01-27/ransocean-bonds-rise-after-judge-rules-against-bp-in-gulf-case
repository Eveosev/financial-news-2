Bonds issued by  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  rose
after a judge ruled that BP Plc can’t collect part of the $40
billion in cleanup costs and economic losses caused by the 2010
oil well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico.  Transocean’s $1.2 billion of 6.375 percent notes due in
December 2021 climbed 2.2 cents to 112.5 cents on the dollar to
yield 4.77 percent at 3:38 p.m. in New York, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  The ruling doesn’t protect Transocean from punitive damages
or fines under the  Clean Water Act ,  Stuart Miller , an analyst at
Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in a report. The summary
judgment is a “credit negative” for Transocean, whose Baa3
rating is on review for a downgrade, Miller said.  The April 2010 Macondo well blowout and the explosion that
followed killed 11 workers and set off the worst offshore  oil
spill  in U.S. history. The sinking of Transocean’s Deepwater
Horizon drilling rig and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against BP, its partners and contractors.  BP sued Transocean in April to recover a share of its
damages and cost from the spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
