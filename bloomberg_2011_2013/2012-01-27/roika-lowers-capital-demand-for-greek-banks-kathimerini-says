The European Commission,  European
Central Bank  and  International Monetary Fund  are asking  Greece 
to re-capitalize its banks using instruments without  voting
rights ,  Kathimerini  reported, citing a  leaked document .  The banks need to have a core tier 1 capital ratio of 10
percent from 2013, instead of this year, as was demanded as a
condition for a May 2010 loan accord, the Athens-based newspaper
said.  The three institutions, known as the troika, have lowered
the banksâ€™ capital requirement for 2012 to 9 percent,
Kathimerini said citing the document, which lays out the
conditions for a second loan accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
