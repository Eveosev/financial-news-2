Inflation in the German state of
Hesse accelerated in January as fuel and food costs increased.  Consumer prices rose 1.9 percent from a year earlier after
gaining an annual 1.7 percent in December, the stateâ€™s
statistics office in Wiesbaden said in an e-mailed statement
today. Prices declined 0.3 percent on the month.  Economists say that German  inflation , calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, will quicken to 2.4 percent
from 2.3 percent, the median of 15 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
 survey  shows. The Federal Statistics Office will release that
report, based on data from six states, on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
