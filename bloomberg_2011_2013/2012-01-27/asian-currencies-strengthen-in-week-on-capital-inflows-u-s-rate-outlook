Asian currencies rose for a fourth
week, spurred by demand for higher-yielding assets after the
 Federal Reserve  pledged to keep  interest rates  near zero through
late 2014.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  climbed to a
three-month high as money managers plowed more cash into
regional bonds and stocks. Malaysia’s ringgit hit a four-month
high and  India ’s rupee touched the strongest level in 11 weeks.
Gains were limited by concern Europe will struggle to forge a
debt-swap deal involving 206 billion euros ($270 billion) of
Greece’s repayment obligations.  “Regional currencies got a big boost this week from
speculation that low interest rates in the U.S. will encourage
fund inflows,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “Still, with Europe’s debt concern
lingering, it’s hard to see a sustained gain from here.”  The ringgit appreciated 2 percent to 3.0427 per dollar as
of 4 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rupee gained 1.7 percent to 49.50 and touched
49.435 earlier, the highest level since Nov. 9. The Philippine
peso and  South Korea ’s won advanced 1 percent to 42.85 and
1,123.20, respectively.  Thailand ’s baht strengthened 0.7 percent
to 31.31.  The Asia Dollar Index rose 1.6 percent this month, the most
in a January since 2006, as central banks in India, Thailand,
 Indonesia  and the Philippines eased credit conditions to bolster
economic growth.  U.S. Interest Rates  The Fed said on Jan. 25 they saw “exceptionally low”
interest rates through 2014, having previously pledged to
refrain from raising borrowing costs until at least mid-2013.
The central bank kept its target rate between zero and 0.25
percent, unchanged since December 2008, to secure a recovery
from the global credit-market crisis.  Greece  needs to repay 14.5
billion euros of debt in March.  Emerging-market bond funds saw inflows of $907 million in
the week through yesterday, Barclays Capital said in a note to
clients today, citing data from EPFR Global. Investors bought
$1.4 billion more stocks than they sold in South Korea, the
Philippines and Thailand in the first four days of this week,
exchange data show.  The ringgit and the peso were little changed today as a
technical indicator, the so-called relative-strength index,
signaled the dollar was poised to rebound against them.  ‘Technical Correction’  “It’s the start of a technical correction,” said Rafael Algarra, executive vice president and head of financial markets
at Security Bank Corp. in  Manila . “We’ve seen a run on the peso
mostly because of the offshore news. People are looking for an
excuse to take profits on this long run.”  Policy makers in Thailand and the  Philippines  lowered
benchmark interest rates this month. India cut the  cash reserve
ratio  for banks on Jan. 24 and Indonesia lowered inter-bank
lending costs on Jan. 17. Bank Negara Malaysia will keep its
overnight rate at 3 percent at its Jan. 30  policy  meeting,
unchanged since May 2011, according to all 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah declined 0.1 percent today to
8,974 per dollar, taking its loss this week to 0.3 percent,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The
Vietnamese dong fell 0.6 percent to 21,023. Financial markets in
 China  and Taiwan were closed all week for the Lunar New Year
holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
