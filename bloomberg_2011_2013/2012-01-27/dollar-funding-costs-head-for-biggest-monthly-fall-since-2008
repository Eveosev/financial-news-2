The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars kept near the lowest levels in five months,
putting it on course for the biggest monthly decline since
December 2008, according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 69 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 12:06 p.m. in
 London , little changed from yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The cost has declined every week since the start of the
year, when the measure was minus 114, aided by the  European
Central Bank ’s 489 billion euros ($634 billion) of three-year
loans in December to avert a credit crunch. The Frankfurt-based
central bank is holding a second auction of cheap funding next
month as part of its longer-term refinancing operation.  ECB loans are “reducing borrowing costs and, more
importantly, avoiding risk in financing for banks because
they’ll be covered for the next three years, even if they’re not
able to issue bonds in the market,” said Alessandro Giansanti,
an analyst at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam.  The decline in costs will continue in the short term and
the three-month cross-currency  basis swap  will “move closer”
to 50 basis points before the end of next month, Giansanti said.  The one-year basis swap was unchanged at 61 basis points
less than Euribor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Euribor-OIS  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  fell to a three-month low. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps, was at 78 basis points. That’s the lowest since Oct. 27
and compares with 79 yesterday.  Overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank fell for a
fourth day to 465 billion euros yesterday from 484 billion euros
on Jan. 25.  Three-month Euribor (EUR003M) , the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 1.138 percent, the lowest since
March, from 1.142 percent. It has declined every day since Dec.
21.  One-week Euribor (EUR001W)  dropped to 0.410 percent from 0.411
percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans fell to 0.551 percent from 0.553 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
