NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) ,  Japan ’s biggest
wireless-phone carrier, will spend 164 billion yen ($2.1
billion) to expand its network capacity after a service
disruption this week, the fifth in eight months.  The company will make the investment during the four years
ending March 31, 2015, Tokyo-based DoCoMo said in a statement
today. Six executives including President Ryuji Yamada will take
pay cuts of as much as 20 percent for three months to take
responsibility for the outage, it said.  DoCoMo is improving its data network in response to a surge
in traffic as smartphones, which allow users to download videos
and surf the Web, gain in popularity. Regulators have ordered
the company to take steps to prevent a similar service
disruption, and report by March 30 on the measures taken, the
communications ministry said in a  statement  yesterday.  The company will take steps including installing new
servers for text messaging, expanding its data capacity and
inspecting all equipment, DoCoMo said.  Voice and data services on DoCoMo’s network were
interrupted for more than four hours on Jan. 25, the company
said that day. As many as 2.52 million users experienced
glitches after a surge in wireless traffic on DoCoMo’s switching
equipment, the carrier said.  DoCoMo fell 0.8 percent to 139,100 yen at the close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
lost 0.1 percent.  Separately, DoCoMo today cut its annual profit forecast 7.8
percent to 474 billion yen for the year ending March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
