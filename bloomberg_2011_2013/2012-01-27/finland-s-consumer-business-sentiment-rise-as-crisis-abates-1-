Finland ’s consumer sentiment rose to
the highest in five months and business confidence improved as
falling bond yields brought a respite in the debt crisis.  The  consumer confidence index  rose more than estimated,
increasing to 3.4 in January from 0.4 in the prior month,
Statistics Finland in Helsinki said on its website today.
Business confidence improved to minus 8 this month from a
revised minus 9 in December, the Confederation of Finnish
Industries said in a separate report.  Europe’s debt crisis has eased as three-year loans from the
 European Central Bank  to the region’s financial institutions
helped bring down yields on Italian and Spanish debt. Italy’s
10-year debt yields about 6 percent, compared with a three-month
average of 6.6 percent, and  Spain ’s similar-maturity securities
yield 5.2 percent, down from an average of 5.6 percent.  Europe is focusing more on boosting growth through reforms
that increase confidence, Finland’s Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg
TV today from Davos, Switzerland.  “We cannot afford to stimulate the economy,” Katainen
said. “Growth comes when the confidence comes back and the
confidence comes back when you do structural reforms even though
it takes time.”  Even so, Finland’s manufacturing sentiment is near its
lowest in two years and  consumer confidence  rose from last
month’s three-year low. Companies surveyed see no production
growth for the next few months and order books are smaller than
average, the business organization said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
