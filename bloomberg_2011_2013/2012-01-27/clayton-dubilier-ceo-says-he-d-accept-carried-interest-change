Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC Chief
Executive Officer Donald Gogel said he’d accept changes to the
carried-interest  tax rate  that enhances compensation for
private-equity partners.  The controversy over U.S. presidential candidate and former
buyout executive  Mitt Romney ’s tax rate may lead to changes to
the U.S. tax code, including the carried-interest rate, Gogel
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s  Erik Schatzker 
at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
