Thailand ’s government will extend a
program to purchase unmilled rice from farmers at above-market
rates to boost prices and raise rural incomes, Commerce Minister
Boonsong Teriyapirom said.  The program, which had been scheduled to end next month,
will be extended for an unspecified period, Boonsong said,
adding that the guaranteed price won’t be less than the current
level of 15,000 baht ($482) per metric ton.  “The ministry and representatives of farmers, millers and
exporters all agreed to jointly work together to lift the rice
price in the current season and the next season to be at an
appropriate win-win level,” Boonsong said today in Bangkok.  Thai rice prices surged to a three-year high of $663 per
ton in November as the government started buying the grain. The
Asian benchmark price, for 100 percent grade B Thai rice, has
since lost 18 percent to $546 as buyers turn to cheaper supplies
from Vietnam and  India .  The ministry wants to increase the price of white rice to
more than $700 a ton this year, and is prepared to buy the
entire 8 million tons of output from the second crop, he said.  The Thai policy has “helped stop global rice prices from
falling sharply,” Sumeth Laomoraphorn, president of C.P.
Intertrade Co., the country’s largest seller of packaged rice
and the nation’s fourth-biggest shipper, said today after
meeting with the commerce minister. “Without the pledging
scheme, we could see the top four rice exporters cut prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
