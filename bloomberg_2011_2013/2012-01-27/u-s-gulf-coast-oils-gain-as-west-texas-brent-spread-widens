U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
increased as the difference between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent widened.  The premium of Brent to WTI rose 71 cents to $11.80 at 2:32
p.m. in  New York , based on the contracts for March delivery,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to WTI widened 20 cents to
$10.10 a barrel at 2:12 p.m.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  increased 60
cents to $12.50 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium widened 90 cents to $10.30. Mars
Blend increased 60 cents to $8.60 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
rose 65 cents to $8.25.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN) ’s premium widened 75 cents to $8.25
over WTI.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount narrowed 2 cents to $2.15 a
barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount was unchanged at $1.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$22.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
