ResMed Inc. (RMD) , the world’s second-
biggest maker of machines to regulate breathing for people with
sleep disorders, rose the most in more than three years after
the company reported record second-quarter income.  The company, based in Poway,  California  and listed on the
Sydney and New York stock exchanges,  climbed  as much as 10.6
percent in Sydney trade and was up 5.9 percent at A$2.69 at
10:49 a.m. Net income in the quarter ended December rose 8
percent to $62.9 million, ResMed said in a regulatory statement.  “Global mask growth remains exceptionally strong,” Peter C. Farrell, chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement.  ResMed’s products are used largely to treat sleep apnea, a
condition causing shallow breathing during sleep. Revenue for
the quarter ended Dec. 31 was $332.7 million, a 9 percent
increase, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
