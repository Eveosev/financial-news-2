Jon Rubinstein , who joined Hewlett-
Packard Co. through the ill-fated acquisition of Palm Inc. in
2010, has left the computer maker, a spokeswoman said.  Rubinstein, who had been Palm’s chief executive officer,
was most recently an executive in  Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) ’s personal
systems group and managed the debut of the TouchPad last year.
He fulfilled a one- to two-year employment commitment and has no
plans to work elsewhere, Mylene Mangalindan, a spokeswoman for
Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard, said today.  A former Apple Inc. executive who worked on the company’s
iMac and iPod products under Steve Jobs, Rubinstein became
chairman of Palm in 2007 and CEO in 2009. Hewlett-Packard, the
world’s largest computer maker, bought Palm for $1.2 billion in
2010.  During his tenure at Hewlett-Packard, Rubinstein oversaw
the introduction of the TouchPad in July. A month and a half
later, then-CEO  Leo Apotheker  ceased development of the tablet
and of smartphones that used the same WebOS operating system
developed at Palm. Apotheker had once planned to include WebOS
on every personal computer the company made.  Current Hewlett-Packard CEO  Meg Whitman  said Dec. 9 she
would release WebOS as an open-source software project, and on
Jan. 25 the company said the software would be released under
the Apache license in September.  Rubinstein’s departure was first reported today by the blog
“All Things Digital.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
