Bolivian state oil company
Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos’s former chief
executive officer Santos Ramirez was sentenced to 12 years in
prison on corruption charges,  La Razon  reported.  Ramirez was convicted of accepting a $450,000 bribe from
Argentine firm  Catler Uniservice  in exchange for awarding an $86
million contract to build a liquefied petroleum gas plant in
2009, the La Paz-based newspaper said. Catler’s general manager
Jorge O’Connor was shot dead in  La Paz  while bringing the money
to Ramirez, according to La Razon.  Ramirez, a former senator who headed the company known as
YPFB from 2008 to 2009, denied the charges, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
