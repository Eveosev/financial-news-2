Occupy London protesters took over a
branch of the  Iraqi Rafidain Bank  in London’s main financial
district days after being peacefully evicted from a vacant
building across from  UBS AG’s (UBS)  London headquarters.  More than 50 squatters moved into the Iraqi bank building
before 6 a.m. today, Occupy spokesman Ronan McNern said by
phone. The 8-story stone building on the corner of Leadenhall
Street and Whittington Avenue is blackened with grime and an
Occupy London banner is hanging outside the fourth floor. Iraqi
Rafidain’s U.K. unit is in liquidation, according to a posting
on the bank’s British website dated Aug. 11.  “Yet another building in the heart of the  City of London 
is empty when there are so many people homeless and many people
are suffering cuts,” McNern said. “It’s a travesty that all
these buildings are lying empty when they could actually be put
to good use.”  Six police vehicles, including three vans, were outside the
property at 4:45 p.m. local time. The building has been vacant
for more than 10 years and the bank was closed in 1990, McNern
said.  Occupy will continue activities such as debates and
lectures at the shuttered Iraqi bank, according to McNern. Some
protesters are still in the first building, which is owned by
Zurich-based UBS and housed the movement for more than two months before the
Jan. 25 eviction, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
