Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , the
construction-equipment maker run by  China ’s richest man, agreed
to buy German concrete pump maker Putzmeister Holding GmbH in
what they said is the largest Chinese-German transaction yet.  Sany and Chinese private equity company CITIC PE Advisors
Ltd. will buy 100 percent of Putzmeister for an undisclosed
price, according to an e-mailed statement today. Aichtal in
 Germany  will become Sany’s new headquarter for concrete
machinery and Norbert Scheuch will remain in his position as the
head of Putzmeister under the Chinese owner.  Putzmeister, which has 3,000 employees and sales of 570
million euros ($751 million), provided concrete pumps to quell
the Fukushima nuclear disaster in  Japan  last year and the
Chernobyl meltdown in the 1980s. Chinese companies are
increasingly hunting for European targets. Chinese solar-panel
maker LDK Solar Co. plans to buy Germany’s  Sunways AG (SWW)  and
Italian luxury-yacht builder Ferretti Group was sold to Shandong
Heavy Industry Group-Weichai Group.  “With this merger Putzmeister and Sany will create a new
and global market leader for concrete pumps,” said Liang Wengen, chairman and founder of Sany, in the statement.
“Putzmeister will remain as an independent brand with its own
management within the  Sany group .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
