Gains in insurers and mining
companies pushed the benchmark gauge for European equities up 20
percent from its September low, marking the start of the
region’s second  bull market  in less than a year.  Lundin Petroleum AB, Barclays Plc and Bank of Ireland Plc
led advances in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  even as Greece’s
creditors wrangled with policy makers over terms of a debt swap
and economists predicted a recession in 2012. While the measure
is up 63 percent since global stocks bottomed in March 2009, it
has declined 11 percent since February 2011.  Equities are rising after European valuations fell to the
lowest level since 2004 compared with the U.S. and analysts
predicted profits among companies in the  Stoxx 600  will climb an
average of 9.5 percent in the next two years. The gauge fell as
much as 26 percent in 2011, compared with 19 percent for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares, which has remained
in a bull market since March 2009.  “Investors have come out of the box, feeling as though
it’s time to try to capitalize on what we know to be very good
structural values,”  Hayes Miller , who helps oversee about $46
billion as the Boston-based head of  asset allocation  in  North
America  at Baring Asset Management Inc., said in a phone
interview yesterday. “For the most part, the worst case
scenarios are now embedded in the price.”  Book Value  The Stoxx 600 trades at 1.44 times  book value , or assets
minus liabilities, compared with 2.15 for the  S&P 500 , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The European gauge had been at
least 30 percent cheaper for 69 straight days as of Jan. 23, the
longest stretch in seven years. Economists forecast U.S. gross
domestic product will expand 2.3 percent in 2012, compared with
a 0.2 percent contraction in  Europe .  The Stoxx 600 plunged 26 percent from Feb. 17 to Sept. 22
last year, led by a retreat in financial shares, amid concern at
least one euro-area nation would default. The previous European
 bear market , from June 2007 to March 2009, resulted in a 61
percent slide in the Stoxx 600 and included the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in September 2008.  “Investors were very worried about another Lehman-style
event out of Europe,”  Martin Schulz , director of international
equities at PNC Capital Advisors LLC in Cleveland, said by
phone. His firm manages $35 billion and raised holdings of
European stocks in the second half of last year. “It’s still in
the backdrop of people’s mind, but it’s definitely not as
compelling or worrisome as it once was.”  Lundin, Boliden  Negotiators representing private creditors returned to
Athens yesterday after European finance ministers insisted
bondholders take bigger losses on their Greek debt. The
 International Monetary Fund  further roiled the discussions by
suggesting that public holders of Greek bonds might also have to
increase support.  “You still have the problem of Greece getting closer to a
default and we still have to see how much of a cascading effect
there will be,” said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than
$20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private-
banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. “I don’t think you’re
buying necessarily real value.”  Lundin Petroleum (LUPE) , a Stockholm-based oil explorer, surged 90
percent since Sept. 22 after increasing its estimate of
recoverable resources for the North Sea Avaldsnes prospect, part
of a discovery that now ranks among Norway’s five biggest
offshore finds.  Boliden AB (BOL) , Scandinavia’s only copper producer,
climbed 62 percent.  Barclays Rally  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-biggest bank by assets,
advanced 61 percent and Bank of Ireland rallied 71 percent,
leading gains in financial companies. The  European Central Bank 
last month loaned an unprecedented 489 billion euros ($641
billion) for three years to the region’s lenders and the  Federal
Reserve  signaled this week it will keep U.S. interest rates low
through late 2014.  The U.K’s  FTSE 100 Index  rallied 15 percent since Sept. 22,
while  Germany ’s DAX surged 27 percent and France’s CAC 40
advanced 21 percent.  Greece ’s ASE fell 7.7 percent as talks on a
debt swap to avert a default on the nation’s debt failed to
reach a conclusion.  “We’ve had a couple of moves from central banks that
suggest policy response is strong,” said Bill Dinning, the
Edinburgh-based strategy chief at Kames Capital Plc, which
manages about $75 billion. “They are providing enough
liquidity. What that all adds up to is equities going higher.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
