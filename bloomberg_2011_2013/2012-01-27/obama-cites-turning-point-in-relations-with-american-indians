President  Barack Obama  said his
administration will be seen as a “turning point” in which the
federal government’s relationship with American Indians “wasn’t
just a side note on a White House agenda.”  Instead, Obama said policies toward American Indians are
“part and parcel” of efforts “to make sure that everyone has
opportunity.”  Obama spoke at a fundraiser with the Native American
Leadership Council at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in  Washington .  “As long as Native Americans face unemployment rates that
are far higher than the national average, we’ve got more work to
do,” Obama said. “We want new businesses and new opportunities
to take root on the reservation. We want to stop repeating the
mistakes of the past.”  About 70 people paid at least $15,000 for tickets to the
event, with the money benefiting the Obama Victory Fund, a joint
effort by Obama’s re-election committee and the  Democratic
Party , according to a campaign official who wasn’t authorized to
comment by name.  Obama, 50, has raised $88 million through Sept. 30, up from
$80 million in 2007. That’s more than twice the amount of money
raised by former Massachusetts Governor  Mitt Romney , the leading
Republican presidential fundraiser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
