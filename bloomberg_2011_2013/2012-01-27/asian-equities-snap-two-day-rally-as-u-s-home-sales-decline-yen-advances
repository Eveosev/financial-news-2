Asian  stocks  edged up, with the
regional benchmark extending its sixth weekly gain, as rising
commodity prices pushed energy and mining shares higher, while
the yen’s rise weighed on Japanese exporters.  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , an Australian oil and gas producer,
added 1.5 percent.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second-largest
carmaker by market value, dropped 1.9 percent after Prime
Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s call for “bold” action failed to
stem the yen’s appreciation.  NEC Corp. (6701)  slid 7.1 percent in Tokyo
after the electronics maker forecast its third loss in four
years. Hong Kong-based  GCL-Poly Energy (3800)  Holdings Ltd. led gains
among solar panel makers in on speculation the market in  China 
and Germany will expand.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  rose 0.1 percent to 122.74 as
of 5:23 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure has risen 1.7 percent this
week, set for a sixth weekly gain, the longest streak since the
period ended Oct. 15. Shares have risen on signs of economic
strength in the U.S. and speculation China will ease policy to
bolster slowing growth.  “The whole world is moving toward monetary easing,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $35 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “ Europe  and the U.S. are
injecting a lot of liquidity, and that’s boosting commodities.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell 0.1 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index rose 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index gained 0.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.4
percent. Stock markets in China, Vietnam and Taiwan were shut
today as the Lunar New Year holidays continue.  Woodside, Inpex Rise  Energy and mining shares rose as oil traded near the
highest price in a week. Crude for March delivery was down 7
cents at $99.63 a barrel today in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial commodities including copper and
aluminum rose 2.4 percent yesterday.  Woodside Petroleum added 1.5 percent to A$34.48.  Inpex
Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, advanced 2.9 percent to
528,000 yen, while Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. climbed 1.3
percent to 3,420 yen.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  fell 0.1 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday as
reports showed that sales of new homes unexpectedly declined in
December and claims for U.S. jobless benefits rose last week.
The  Federal Reserve  on Jan. 25 extended its pledge to keep
 interest rates  near zero through 2014 and said it is considering
additional asset purchases to spur growth.  ‘Anemic Recovery’  “It’s a very anemic recovery in which parts of the economy
are picking up, while other parts remain weak,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana
Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. Investors should “have a mind-set of
conserving capital until the macro environment becomes a bit
clearer.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 7.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with rises of 4.8 percent by the  S&P
500  in the U.S. and 5.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book value,
compared with 2.1 times for the S&P and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600.  Gains in Asian stocks were limited as the yen advanced
against all 16 major counterparts. A stronger yen erodes income
of some Japanese exporters when repatriated.  Exporters Slide  Honda slid 1.9 percent to 2,689 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s No.
1 exporter of consumer electronics, fell 1.4 percent to 1,414

mobile phones, computers and wireless gear yesterday forecast a
100 billion-yen loss for the year ending March 31, abandoning a
previous outlook for a 15 billion-yen profit. It will also take
a charge of 40 billion yen for 10,000 job cuts, the Tokyo-based
company said.  GCL-Poly Energy added 2.8 percent to HK$2.56 after a
proposal in Germany to limit total installations and cut
subsidies failed to get unanimous backing, according to a
lawmaker.  China may double its solar installations this year,
absorbing excess production of panels that depressed prices and
margins in 2011, the heads of two of the industry’s top five
manufacturers said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
