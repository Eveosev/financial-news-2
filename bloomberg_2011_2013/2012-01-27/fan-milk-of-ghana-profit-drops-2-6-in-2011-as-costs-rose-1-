Fan Milk Ghana Ltd. (FML) , a maker of ice
cream and dairy products in the West African nation, said profit
declined 2.6 percent in 2011 as costs rose.  Net income dropped to 18.9 million cedis ($11.2 million) in
the 12 months through December from 19.4 million cedis a year
earlier, the company said in a statement published in the
Ghanaian Times newspaper today.  “Even though revenue increased, the company’s cost of
sales and distribution costs rose faster during the year,”
Randy Mensah, an analyst at Accra-based Databank Financial
Services Ltd., said by phone today. “Finance costs also
increased while some of the assets of the company were
depreciated faster.”  Fan Milk’s cost of sales rose 7 percent to 49.5 million
cedis, while distribution costs climbed 13 percent to 22.5
million cedis, the company said in the statement.  Revenue growth of 5.3 percent to 109.3 million cedis “was
not impressive to me,” said Derrick Mensah, an analyst at
Accra-based brokerage firm  SIC Financial Services Ltd. , by phone
today. “We can attribute it to an increase in the price of some
of its products at the beginning of the year.”  The company’s shares were unchanged at 2.3 cedis on the
Ghana Stock Exchange by 11:43 a.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
