German 10-year bunds rose for a
third day as the failure of Greek officials and the nation’s
creditors to agree on a debt-swap deal boosted demand for the
safety of  Europe ’s benchmark government debt.  Two-year  yields  fell toward a two-week low as Luxembourg
Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, said a Greek default would have
contagion effects and must be avoided at all costs. Italy is
scheduled to auction as much as 11 billion euros ($14.4 billion)
of bills today.  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 8:10 a.m. London time. The
2 percent bond due in January 2022 rose 0.09, or 90 euro cents
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.245. The yield earlier
dropped to 1.85 percent, the lowest since Jan. 19.  The two-year yield declined one basis point to 0.17 percent
after falling to 0.16 percent, the least since Jan. 17.  Bunds have handed investors a loss of 0.4 percent this
year, after gaining 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Italian bonds have gained 5 percent this
year, and Greek debt returned 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
