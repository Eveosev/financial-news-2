The Polish zloty’s recent gains on
improved  market sentiment  may “alleviate” policy makers’
concern about inflation this year, central bank Governor Marek Belka said today in an interview with Bloomberg TV in Davos,
 Switzerland .  While a weaker zloty complicates monetary policy by fueling
rises in consumer prices, it is also “helpful” in shielding
Polish exporters from the effects of the euro area’s debt
crisis, Belka said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
