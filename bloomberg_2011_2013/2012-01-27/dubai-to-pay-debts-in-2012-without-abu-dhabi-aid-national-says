Dubai will meet its schedule of
repaying $14 billion in debt this year “without a doubt,” The
National reported, citing the chief executive of state-owned
holding company Investment Corp. of Dubai.  A deal with creditors for Dubai World unit Drydocks World
LLC, which is restructuring $2.2 billion in debt, is “90
percent there” and should be closed very soon, Mohammed al- Shaibani told the newspaper in Davos, Switzerland, where he is
attending the annual meeting of the  World Economic Forum .  Dubai doesn’t expect to need financing from neighbor  Abu
Dhabi  in 2012, The National reported, citing al-Shaibani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
