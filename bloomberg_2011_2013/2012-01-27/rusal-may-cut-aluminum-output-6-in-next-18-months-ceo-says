United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s
largest aluminum producer, may cut output 6 percent in the next
18 months, Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  told Bloomberg
Television in Davos, Switzerland.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  and their global rivals are
cutting production after the slump in prices. Alcoa, the largest
U.S. producer, reported its first loss in two years this month,
and said China may use 70 percent of its capacity in 2012. Rusal
has annual capacity to produce 4.7 million metric tons of the
light metal a year.  Rusal is monitoring the situation and, if margins are
falling, may “go downstream, adding value in producing
alloys,” Deripaska said today in the interview.  Low prices may force as much as 3 million tons of global
capacity to be closed or mothballed, Deripaska said last month.  Aluminum traded as high as $2,288 a ton on the London
Metals Exchange today. The metal has advanced 13 percent since
Jan. 1 after falling almost 28 percent last year from its May 3
peak of $2,797.  To contact the reporters on this story:
