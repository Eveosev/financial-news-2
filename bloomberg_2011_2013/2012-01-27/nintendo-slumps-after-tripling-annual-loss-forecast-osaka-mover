Nintendo Co. (7974) , the world’s largest
maker of video-game machines, slumped to an eight-year low in
Osaka trading after tripling its loss forecast as the success of
rival  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  devices erodes demand for its 3DS player.  Nintendo dropped as much as 7.8 percent to 9,910 yen, the
 lowest level  on an intraday basis since February 2004. The stock
traded 4.5 percent lower at 10,270 yen as of 2:43 p.m. on the
Osaka Securities Exchange.  President Satoru Iwata, who cut prices for the 3DS handheld
player by as much as 40 percent in 2011, lowered the full-year
sales forecast for the device 13 percent to 14 million units.
The creator of “Super Mario Bros.” games is predicting its
first annual loss in at least three decades because of a surging
yen and a consumer preference for gaming on the iPhone and iPad
that helped Apple more than double profit last quarter.  “I’m not sure that there is much they can do to reverse
the trend,” said  Michael Pachter , a Los Angeles-based analyst
at Wedbush Securities Inc. The market for handhelds “will be
smaller in the future than in the past, limited to people
willing to pay a premium for high-quality content to play on a
dedicated game device.”  The  net loss  in the year ending in March may be 65 billion
yen ($844 million), compared with an earlier forecast for a loss
of 20 billion yen, the Kyoto, Japan-based company  said  in a
statement yesterday. That compared with an expected loss of 29
billion, according to the  average  of 18 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  The operating loss this year may be 45 billion yen,
compared with an earlier estimate for a profit of 1 billion yen,
according to the statement.  New Games  “It took time for us to revive sales momentum” with new
titles featuring the Mario character after the 3DS price cuts,
Iwata said yesterday.  The console maker hasn’t reported a full-year net loss and
operating loss since 1981, when it began releasing consolidated
earnings, according to its  website .  Nintendo had a foreign exchange loss of 53.7 billion yen in
the nine-month period. Nintendo based its annual forecast on the
exchange rate of 98 yen to the euro, compared with an earlier
forecast of 106 yen. The company kept its estimated exchange
rate of 77 yen to the dollar.  Nintendo generates about 80 percent of revenue  outside
Japan , and a stronger yen reduces the repatriated value of
 overseas  assets. The U.S. currency traded at 76.97 yen, and the
euro was unchanged at 101.83 yen at 1:52 p.m. in Tokyo.  Price Cuts  The company cut the price of the 3DS by 40 percent to
15,000 yen in  Japan  in August. The company reduced the price in
the U.S. to $170 from $250. Nintendo sold 11.4 million units of
the 3DS handheld player, released in February, in the nine
months ended Dec. 31.  Users are increasingly turning to playing on devices from
Apple, whose  App Store  offers more than 100,000 game and
entertainment titles for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Apple
on Jan. 24 reported sales of 37 million iPhones in the quarter
ended Dec. 31, helping its profit surge to $13.1 billion in the
period.  Sales of 3DS title “Monster Hunter 3 (Tri) G” topped 1
million units in the 10 days after it hit the market on Dec. 10,
the game’s creator,  Capcom Co. (9697) ,  said  Dec. 21. “Super Mario 3D
Land” and “Mario Kart 7,” introduced in November and December,
respectively, each sold more than 1 million units in the U.S.,
Nintendo  said  Jan. 3.  Sales of titles for the 3DS may total 38 million units this
fiscal year, down 24 percent from the company’s previous
estimate, Nintendo said.  Iwata said he is confident the company will return to
profit next year and Nintendo will “soon” start charging users
for downloading additional content to a software title.  The company also plans to release the Wii U console, its
successor to the Wii, in time for the  Christmas shopping season 
this year, he told analysts and investors at a meeting today.  “We will make use of our bitter experience with the 3DS”
when the company starts to introduce the new console, Iwata said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
