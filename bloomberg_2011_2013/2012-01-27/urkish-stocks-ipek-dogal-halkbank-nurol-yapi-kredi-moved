million).  Nurol Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (NUGYO)  , a real
estate company, added 2.1 percent to 7.80 liras. Nurol bought

 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , rose for a third day, adding 4.6 percent to 3.45

Reserve ’s forcast of “exceptionally low”  interest rates 
through 2014 signaled easing of liquidity conditions and allayed
concerns about the Turkish lender’s capital position.  To contact the reporter on this story:
