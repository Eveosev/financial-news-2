(Corrects sales figure for 2011 in third paragraph in story
originally published Jan. 27.)  OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ)  plans to start producing
a sedan based on  Renault SA (RNO)  platforms next month amid talks with
the French company and its partner Nissan Motor Co. to boost
their stake in Russia’s largest automaker.  The first of the new Lada models should roll of the
assembly line at the end of February, AvtoVAZ Chief Executive
Officer Igor Komarov said in interview at the  World Economic
Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, yesterday.  AvtoVAZ will later produce Nissan-branded cars on the same
line, allowing AvtoVAZ to boost output to as many as 750,000
cars and kits this year, after selling about 730,000 last year,
according to Komarov.  Renault-Nissan Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn said
Jan. 9 that the partnership may be “weeks” away from an
agreement with AvtoVAZ shareholders to boost its stake to 50
percent from the 25 percent the Renault now holds by itself.  Komarov said he expects Renault-Nissan to reach a deal with
other shareholders “soonest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
