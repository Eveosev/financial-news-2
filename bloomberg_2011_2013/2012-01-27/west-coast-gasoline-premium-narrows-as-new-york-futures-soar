The premium for California-blend
gasoline in  Los Angeles  narrowed as New York futures surged to
the highest level since August on concern that refinery outages,
maintenance and closures may tighten supplies.  Carbob (MOGLDB85)  fell 2 cents to a premium of 8.5 cents a gallon
against gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:18 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel rose 5.26
cents to $3.0084 a gallon.  Futures gained 2.8 percent after ConocoPhillips said it
planned to shut the fluid catalytic cracker at the Bayway
refinery in  New Jersey . Two unprofitable Pennsylvania refineries
have closed and Hovensa LLC plans to shut its 350,000-barrel-a-
day St. Croix plant in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  next month.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 8.02 cents to $2.9268 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest
settlement since Aug. 31.  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  dropped 1 cent to a discount of 0.5
cent, the first shift from a premium in two weeks.  San Francisco 
gasoline for prompt delivery rose 6.26 cents $2.9184 a gallon as
California refineries also shut for maintenance.  Alon US Energy Inc. closed the 55,000-barrel-a-day
 Paramount (PAPACRUD)  oil refinery in Southern California for planned work
that may last for a month, according to two people familiar with
the maintenance. The Dallas-based company shut the plant in
coordination with an outage at the Bakersfield refinery in
Central California, one person said yesterday.  Valero Energy Corp. is also conducting a four-week
maintenance turnaround on units at the 135,000-barrel-a-day
 Wilmington (VAWICRUD)  oil refinery in  Southern California .  California-blend diesel in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD)  fell 0.25 cent to a
premium of 1.75 cents against Nymex heating oil futures. The
same fuel in  San Francisco (DIEISCAD)  was unchanged at a discount of 1
cent.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon , was
unchanged at a discount of 8 cents to futures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
