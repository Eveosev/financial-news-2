OAO TMK (TMKS) , the world’s largest
pipemaker by output, sees “solid” demand for steel pipes this
year driven by high oil prices and shale-gas projects in the
U.S., billionaire Chairman Dmitry Pumpyansky said.  “In the absence of macroeconomic shocks, we expect solid
orders for most of 2012,” Pumpyansky said in an interview
yesterday in Davos, Switzerland. TMK shipped a record 4.2
million metric tons of pipes last year and expects about the
same this year, said the billionaire, who owns almost 70 percent
of TMK.  Demand for large-diameter pipes in Russia may slow as  OAO
Gazprom (GAZP)  hasn’t yet agreed on building a  gas pipeline  to  China ,
Pumpyansky said. Gazprom is more likely to start accepting bids
for materials for the South Stream or Shtokman projects as early
as this year, he said. The decline will be offset by growing
demand in the oil industry.  The pipemaker’s TMK-IPSCO unit in the U.S., where shale gas
output has raised demand, accounts for almost 30 percent of
revenue and shipments, Pumpyansky said. TMK is developing more
expensive and technologically advanced products, including
premium connections for pipes, and expanding into new markets,
he said. TMK shipped its pipes to a record 80 countries last
year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
