Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the fourth day as the central bank failed to attract any bids
for its repurchase agreements.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy appreciated
0.3 percent to 84.83 per dollar and was trading 0.1 percent
stronger at 85.05 at 4:40 p.m. in the capital Nairobi, compared
with yesterday’s New York close.  The central bank didn’t get any bids for its 1 billion
shillings ($11.7 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements, a
central bank official, who declined to be named in line with the
bank’s policy, said in a phone interview from Nairobi today.  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  Uganda ’s shilling strengthened on increased dollar inflows
by investors settling payment of treasury bills. The currency of
the third-biggest economy in East Africa appreciated as much as
1.5 percent and was trading 0.9 percent higher at 2,343 per
dollar at 4:46 p.m., in the capital, Kampala.  “There is also interbank selling of the dollar from
offshore players for the settlement of this week’s Treasury bill
auction,” Taib Lubega, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda
Ltd., said by phone from Kampala.  Tanzania’s shilling remained unchanged at 1,598 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
