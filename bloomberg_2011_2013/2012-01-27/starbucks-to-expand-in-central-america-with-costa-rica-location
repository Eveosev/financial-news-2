Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  plans to open its
first Costa Rican location in May as the world’s largest coffee-
shop chain boosts its presence in the region.  Since announcing plans to enter the Central American market
in August 2010, Starbucks has opened six locations in the
region, including four in El Salvador and two in Guatemala.  “Starbucks has purchased Costa Rican coffee for many
years,” Pablo Arizmendi-Kalb, general manager of Starbucks in
Latin America, said in a statement. “With this opening, we are
committed to expanding our role in the rich coffee heritage 
present in  Costa Rica .” The cafe will be located in San José, 
the nation’s capital.  Manuela Velásquez, marketing director of Starbucks Central
America, said in a phone interview from  El Salvador  that the
company anticipates adding locations this year in Costa Rica.
Starbucks currently operates 535 coffee shop locations in Latin
America, Velásquez said.  Starbucks, which has more than 10,700 U.S. cafes and 6,200
abroad, gets more than 20 percent of revenue from international
stores.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
