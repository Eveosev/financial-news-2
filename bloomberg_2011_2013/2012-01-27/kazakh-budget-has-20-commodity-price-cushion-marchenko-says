Kazakhstan ’s budget would withstand
a drop in commodity prices of as much as 20 percent without
significant harm to the economy or banks, central bank Chairman
Grigori Marchenko said.  “Prices of raw materials are above what we need at the
moment,” Marchenko told reporters today in Astana, the capital.
“The safety margin is big enough, 15 percent to 20 percent. If
prices fall 10 percent, nothing will change for the country.”  Kazakhstan, the second-biggest crude producer among former
Soviet nations, is trying to ensure stability after riots last
month in an oil-rich region bordering the  Caspian Sea  left at
least 14 dead and about 100 injured. President  Nursultan Nazarbayev , 71, has ruled Kazakhstan since 1989.  Copper (MBCUCU35)  at more than $8,000 a metric ton is above the
budget-neutral level of $6,500 a ton, Marchenko said. Grain
prices are also higher than the level seen as comfortable by
Kazakh economic policy makers, he said.  Extra liquidity in Kazakhstan’s financial system has
reached $12 billion to $13 billion, meaning banks should be able
to step up lending to companies.  “We would like banks that have excess liquidity to lend
more to the economy,” Marchenko said. “On the other hand, this
money is that security pillow that will help us overcome a
coming crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
