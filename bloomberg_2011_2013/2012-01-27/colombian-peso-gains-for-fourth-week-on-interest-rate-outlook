Colombia’s peso rose for a fourth
week, the longest winning streak since July, amid higher foreign
investment inflows and as speculation the central bank will
continue raising  interest rates  boosted demand for the nation’s
higher-yielding assets.  The currency advanced 0.9 percent this week to 1,807.03 per
 U.S. dollar . It gained 0.2 percent today, from 1,810.8
yesterday. The peso yesterday touched 1,794.51, the strongest
level since Sept. 9.  Betting the Colombian peso will gain has proven to be the
most profitable risk-adjusted trade in the foreign-exchange
market this year as policy makers raise interest rates to keep
inflation in check. The higher rates have attracted increasing
foreign inflows as investors purchase the country’s higher-
yielding assets with money borrowed in countries where rates are
lower, a practice known as the carry trade, said Julian Marquez,
an analyst at Interbolsa SA, Colombia’s biggest brokerage.  “Not only do you have the carry trade, but the economy is
expanding, which makes Colombian assets attractive,” said
Julian Marquez, an analyst at Interbolsa SA,  Colombia ’s biggest
brokerage.  Most economists surveyed by the central bank for a report
published Jan. 12 forecast policy makers will keep the key
lending rate at 4.75 percent at their meeting on Jan. 30, before
raising it a quarter point to 5 percent in February and to 5.5
percent by year-end.  Colombia’s economy grew 7.7 percent in the third quarter
from a year ago, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of
2006. It may have grown as much as 6 percent in 2011, the
fastest pace since 2007, according to the central bank.  Foreign-direct investment in Colombia jumped 58 percent in
2011 to a record $15 billion, with 81 percent going into oil and
mining, according to trade balance data from the central bank.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
7.33 percent. The bond’s price fell 0.574 centavo to 121.26
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
