Oil snapped a two-day increase after
disappointing U.S. economic growth in the fourth quarter
undermined hopes that fuel demand in the world’s largest crude
consumer will rebound.  Futures were little changed, having wiped out most of this
week’s gain after the U.S. data. Gross domestic product, the
value of all goods and services produced, climbed at a 2.8
percent annual following a 1.8 percent gain in the prior
quarter, Commerce Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
called for a 3 percent increase.  Crude for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 12 cents at $99.58 a barrel at 1:55 p.m.
London time after rising as high as $100.50 earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
