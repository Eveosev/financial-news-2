 A revised United Nations draft
resolution on  Syria  hasn’t softened Russian opposition to calls
that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad resign.  Russia  is ready to cooperate with Western and Arab nations
in drawing up a resolution on Syria as long as it is aimed at
promoting “inclusive dialogue between all Syrian sides,” the
Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website today, citing
Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov.  Countries including Qatar, the U.K. and the U.S. have
revised their proposed UN security council resolution in a bid
to overcome Russian objections, with a call for Assad to
transfer power to a deputy. Previous language, which urged Assad
to relinquish power to pave way for elections, was replaced with
a call for him to hand over “full authority” to his deputy and
for the “formation of a national unity government,” according
to the draft obtained by Bloomberg News.  “As far as the new amendments are concerned, there are
some positive aspects,” Gatilov said. “In particular the
support for the continued Arab League observer mission, calls on
all sides to stop violence and launch national dialogue and on
other governments to persuade the Syrian opposition to start a
process of reconciliation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
