Social media company  Renren Inc (RENN) . led
a surge in Chinese Internet companies after a report that
Facebook Inc. may file for an initial public offering next week.  Renren jumped 26 percent to $5.25 at the close in New York
after the Wall Street Journal report, the most in more than
eight months.  Sina Corp (SINA) ., which operates a service similar to
Twitter, rose 12 percent to $69.96.  Facebook, the largest social-networking site, may be valued
at $75 billion to $100 billion in the IPO, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing unidentified people. A Facebook IPO may
increase investors’ willingness to buy stock in Chinese
companies that offer similar services, said Echo He, an analyst
at Maxim Group LLC in  New York .  “It just confirms that a lot of investors are interested
in this type of company,” she said. “There are some investors
getting in. People don’t want to be late.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
