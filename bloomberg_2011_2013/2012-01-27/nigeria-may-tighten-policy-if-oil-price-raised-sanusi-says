Nigeria ’s central bank may raise
interest rates if lawmakers agree to increase the budgeted oil
price to $75, fueling inflation, Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  “If the National Assembly does that, which we think is
inadvisable, then we would have to look at an even tighter
situation because we’ve got to respond to protect  price
stability ” Sanusi said in an interview in Davos today.  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, will be dealing
with a “number of inflationary threats” this year, the
governor said. A reduction in the fuel subsidy will have a
“short-term” impact on inflation and higher government
spending is a “major, major concern” for the central bank,
Sanusi said.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  has continued to increase its
holdings of yuan, mainly in cash and deposits, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
