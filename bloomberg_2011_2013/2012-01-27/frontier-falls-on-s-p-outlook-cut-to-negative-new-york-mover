Frontier Communications Corp. (FTR)  closed
at the lowest price since at least 1988 after  Standard & Poor’s 
revised its outlook to negative from stable for the telephone
company serving rural markets.  The ratings company announced the change in a statement
yesterday, saying Frontier faces declines in revenue and cash
flow as competition increases from cable telephony and from
wireless substitution of wired telephones. S&P also affirmed
Frontier’s corporate credit rating at BB, two steps below
investment grade, and its debt-issue ratings.  Frontier fell 3.6 percent to $4.31 at the close in New
York. The shares have declined 53 percent in 12 months.  Brigid Smith, a spokeswoman for  Stamford , Connecticut-based
Frontier, didn’t respond to a call and an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
