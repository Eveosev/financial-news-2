German  tax revenue  surged last year
more than Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government estimated, led
by intake at federal level, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Revenue rose 7.9 percent to 525.4 billion euros ($691
billion), beating a growth target of 7.5 percent, the Berlin-
based ministry said today in its monthly report. Tax income
increased 4.1 percent in December from a year earlier to 70.8
billion euros, a slower pace than in November amid more subdued
growth, it said.  Economic data “point to an economic weakening” in the
final quarter of last year and the first three months of 2012,
the ministry said. Business sentiment suggests “that the pace
of economic expansion in  Germany  will increase again in the
course of this year, supported by accelerating global growth.”  German  business confidence  jumped more than economists
forecast in January, adding to evidence that Germany has shaken
off a possible contraction in the fourth quarter. While the
 International Monetary Fund  cut its prediction for German
expansion this year, it said on Jan. 24 that the economy will
weather a recession in the region and keep growing.  Consumer spending  will play an “important role” in
bolstering growth as companies continue to hire and labor unions
win better pay deals for workers, the ministry said. Foreign
trade will make a negative contribution to growth as the rise in
imports will be bigger than the gain in exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
