At least one ticket to the Super
Bowl rematch between the  New York Giants  and the  New England
Patriots  has sold for $16,480, according to the  National
Football League ’s official resale site.  That price for the Feb. 5 game at Lucas Oil Stadium in
Indianapolis eclipsed an $11,883 ticket that was sold on the  NFL
Ticket Exchange  as of Jan. 23, according to data released today
by the company.  The new highest-priced seat sold is in the lower level at
the 40-yard line, along the Giants’ sideline. The league doesn’t
disclose how many seats are sold at each price point.  There are 1,400 tickets still available on the NFL Ticket
Exchange, with the low at $2,600, which is $214 higher than
yesterday’s cheapest. The highest-priced ticket, for a Row 1,
50-yard-line seat, is available for $17,048. The average price
for tickets sold on the site is $4,223.  The face value of Super Bowl tickets is from $800 to $1,200
each.  The average price for the NFL title game rose 1.5 percent
across several Web platforms yesterday, a day after rising 6.2
percent, according to TiqIQ, an event ticket aggregator that
tracks listings from StubHub, EBay, TicketNetwork and
TicketsNow, a partner of the NFL Ticket Exchange.  Ticket prices have tended to fall $200-$500 in the week
before the game based on data from the past two Super Bowls,
according to Chris Matcovich, a spokesman for TiqIQ.  “It’s a little unusual that the increase in ticket price
has gone on this long,” Matcovich said in a telephone
interview. “It’s something people probably want to monitor.”  The lowest price for a ticket is currently $2,400 on the
sites TiqIQ monitors.  “If you think that prices are going to go down and you’re
willing to wait until Friday or Saturday, you might find a
desperate fellow,” Matcovich said. “You may save yourself a
few hundred dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
