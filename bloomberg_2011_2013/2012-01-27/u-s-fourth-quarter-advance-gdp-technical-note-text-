Following is the text of the
Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  Technical Note  Gross Domestic Product  Fourth Quarter of 2011 (Advance)  January 27, 2012  This technical note provides background information about the
source data and estimating methods used to produce the estimates
presented in the GDP news release.  The complete set of estimates
for the fourth quarter is available on BEA's Web site at
www.bea.gov; a brief summary of "highlights" is also posted on
the Web site.  In a few weeks, the estimates will be published in
BEA's monthly journal, the Survey of Current Business, along with
a more detailed analysis of the estimates ("GDP and the
Economy").  Real GDP  Real GDP increased 2.8 percent (annual rate) in the fourth
quarter of 2011, following an increase of 1.8 percent in the
third quarter.  The acceleration in real GDP in the fourth
quarter reflected an upturn in inventory investment and
accelerations in  consumer spending  and in residential fixed
investment that were partly offset by a deceleration in
nonresidential fixed investment, a downturn in federal  government
spending , an acceleration in imports, and a larger decrease in
state and local government spending.  Source Data for the Advance Estimate  The advance GDP estimate for the fourth quarter of 2011 is based
on source data that are incomplete and subject to revision.
Three months of source data were available for consumer spending
on goods; shipments of capital equipment, including aircraft;
motor vehicle sales and inventories; manufacturing durables
inventories; federal government outlays; and consumer, producer,
and international prices. Only two months of data were available
from most other key data sources; BEA's assumptions for the third
month are shown in table A. Among those assumptions are the
following:  *an increase in nondurable manufacturing inventories,
*an increase in non-motor-vehicle merchant wholesale and retail
 inventories,
*an increase in exports of goods, excluding gold, and
*an increase in imports of goods, excluding gold.  Prices  The price index for gross domestic purchasesùthe prices paid by
U.S. residents for goods and services wherever producedùincreased
0.8 percent in the fourth quarter after increasing 2.0 percent in
the third. Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for
gross domestic purchases increased 1.0 percent after increasing
1.8 percent.  Disposable Personal Income and Personal Saving  Real disposable personal income (DPI) increased 0.8 percent in
the fourth quarter, following a decrease of 1.9 percent in the
third.  Current-dollar DPI increased 1.5 percent, following an
increase of 0.4 percent. The personal saving rate was 3.7 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with 3.9 percent in the third.  Fourth quarter corporate profits and gross domestic income (which
is a measure of output based on the costs incurred and the
incomes earned in the production of GDP), as usual, are not
available with the advance GDP estimate; they are scheduled for
release with the third GDP estimate on March 29, 2012.  Table A. KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE ADVANCE ESTIMATE OF GDP  FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011  For many of the key series used to prepare the advance estimate
of GDP, including retail sales, unit automobile and truck sales
and inventories, manufacturers' shipments of nondefense capital
goods, manufacturers' inventories of durable goods, federal
defense spending, and consumer, producer, and international price
indexes, actual data are available for all months of the quarter.  For the key series shown in this table, actual data for the third
month of the quarter usually are not available in time for
inclusion in the advance GDP estimate.  BEA makes assumptions for
the source data that are not yet available; assumptions for
December 2011 are shown in the last column of the table.  For
most series shown, the data for November are preliminary and
subject to further revision. Occasionally, the data for earlier
months are also subject to revision.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars,
seasonally adjusted at annual rates, and are published by the
Bureau of the Census.  2011  Jul.      Aug.      Sep.      Oct.      Nov.
