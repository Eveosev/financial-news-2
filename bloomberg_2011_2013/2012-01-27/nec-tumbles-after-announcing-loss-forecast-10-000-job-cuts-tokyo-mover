NEC Corp. (6701)  fell the most in 10 months
in  Tokyo  trading after forecasting its third annual loss in four
years and announcing 10,000 job cuts.  NEC dropped as much as 8.9 percent, the largest intraday
decline since March 15, and traded 7.1 percent lower at 156 yen
at the 11:30 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. It was the
 biggest  percentage loser on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average,
which climbed 0.4 percent.  Consumers flocking to Apple Inc.’s iPhones and Samsung
Electronics Co.’s Galaxy smartphones dented demand at NEC’s
handset division, which will bear the brunt of the job cuts. NEC
joined Nintendo Co. yesterday in  forecasting  a loss for the year
ending March 31, of 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion), abandoning a
previous outlook for profit of 15 billion yen.  “The restructuring plan appears to lack business
strategies,”  Takeo Miyamoto , a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche
Bank AG with a “hold”  rating  on NEC, said by telephone today.
“I got the impression that management simply drew up the job-
cut figure without thinking carefully about what needs to be
reduced or kept. Investors are betting its earnings may not
improve.”  NEC will take a charge of 40 billion yen for the job cuts
and also won’t pay a dividend for the year, the Tokyo-based
maker of mobile phones, computers and wireless gear  said 
yesterday after the market’s close.  The cuts, equivalent to about 8.6 percent of NEC’s
workforce, may begin March 31 and will be split between full-and
part-time jobs, the company said. About 7,000 of the jobs will
be eliminated in  Japan , mainly at the mobile-phone unit.  Employee Reductions  The company had 115,840  employees  at the end of March last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. NEC last
announced a major job reduction in 2009, when it said it was
cutting more than 20,000 workers, mostly in the semiconductor
and electronic-component businesses.  NEC has decided to invest its “limited resources” in
fewer business segments because of macroeconomic concerns about
 Europe  and  developing countries , President Nobuhiro Endo said
yesterday.  The stock has lost 37 percent of its market value in the
past 12 months, compared with a 15 percent decline for the
benchmark Nikkei.  The company’s net loss widened to 86.5 billion yen in the
 three months  ended Dec. 31 from 26.5 billion yen a year earlier,
and sales fell 6.7 percent to 672 billion yen.  Apple, Samsung Profits  Samsung posted a 17 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit
to 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion) today, helped by sales of
Galaxy models. Apple’s quarterly profit more than doubled to
$13.1 billion after selling 37 million iPhones in the period,
the company reported Jan. 24.  Osaka , Japan-based Nintendo widened its full-year loss
forecast threefold yesterday as the popularity of the iPhone and
iPad eroded demand for its 3DS handheld game player.  “NEC needs to show how it will drive its growth,” said
Yuichi Ishida, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in
Tokyo, who rates the stock “neutral.” It’s unclear how NEC can
achieve the targets outlined in its medium-term plan for the
mobile-phone, computer and car-battery businesses, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
