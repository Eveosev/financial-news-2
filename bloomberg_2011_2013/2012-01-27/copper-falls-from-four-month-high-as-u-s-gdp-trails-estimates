Copper futures fell from a four-
month high after the  U.S. economy  expanded less than forecast,
signaling that a rally in metal prices may be overdone.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced, climbed at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, trailing the 3 percent median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News, government data showed today.
Equities declined after the report.  GDP “highlights that there are downside risks to the
market that people may have been ignoring,” Jason Schenker, the
president of Prestige Economics LLC in Austin,  Texas , said in a
telephone interview.  Copper futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$3.8905 a pound at 10:30 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . Earlier,
the metal reached $3.939, the highest for a most-active contract
since Sept. 16.  Industrial metals rallied this week after the  Federal
Reserve  pledged to keep its benchmark U.S. interest rate close
to zero percent until late 2014.  “All of the markets responded positively to the statement,
but part of the reason the Fed is keeping rates low is that
growth is going to be slow,” Schenker said. “People are
ignoring that half of the equation.”  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.2 percent to $8,569.25 a metric ton ($3.89 a
pound).  Lead, aluminum, zinc and nickel also declined in London,
while tin rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
