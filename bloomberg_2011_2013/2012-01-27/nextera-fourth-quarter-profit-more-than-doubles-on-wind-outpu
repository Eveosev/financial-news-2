NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest
generator of wind and solar power in  North America , said fourth-
quarter profit more than doubled as its  wind turbines  produced
more electricity.  Net income rose to $667 million, or $1.59 a share, from
$263 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier,  Juno Beach , Florida-
based NextEra said in a statement today. Excluding gains from
contracts used to lock in commodity prices, per-share profit was
2 cents more than the average of 14  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 13 percent to $3.86 billion. Profit more than
quadrupled at its  wind and solar unit , rising to $402 million
from $73 million, the company said. NextEra’s wind farms
generated 580,000 more megawatt-hours in the quarter from the
same period a year earlier, according to the statement. The
company plans to spend as much as $2.3 billion this year and
$1.5 billion in 2013 and 2014 on solar development.  “The wind assets performed stronger than expected and
while in the fourth quarter the  Florida  economy wasn’t
fantastic, it didn’t stop them from beating estimates by a few
pennies,”  David Parker , a Tampa, Florida-based analyst with
Robert W. Baird & Co., said in a telephone interview.  Florida Power & Light, NextEra’s utility, sold 2.7 percent
less power to retail customers in the fourth quarter because of
warmer-than-usual weather. Excluding the effects of weather,
power demand rose 1.2 percent at the utility, which added about
25,000 more customers during the quarter.  Warmer Fourth Quarter  Average temperatures in Florida were 67 degrees Fahrenheit
(19.4 Celsius) during the fourth quarter, 7.3 percent warmer
than the same period a year earlier, according to the  National
Climatic Data Center .  NextEra plans to finish building all its existing wind
projects by the end of 2012, before a federal tax credit worth
2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour expires, Chief Financial Officer Moray Dewhurst said on a conference call today.  Per-share earnings this year will be between $4.35 and
$4.65, the company said.  NextEra, which has 14 buy, 12 hold and one sell
 recommendation  from analysts, fell 0.3 percent to $59.50 at
10:12 a.m. in  New York . All of the 13 members of the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Electric Utilities Index  slid today. Only one
company, Pinnacle West Capital Corp., has gained this year.  “There aren’t many electric stocks that are doing well,
but NextEra has held up very well compared to the industry
overall,” Michael Worms, a New York-based analyst for BMO
Capital Markets, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
