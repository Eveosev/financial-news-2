Saudi Arabia ’s Finance Minister
Ibrahim al-Assaf said the world’s top oil exporter may be
willing to increase its contribution to the  International
Monetary Fund .  “We have been there for the IMF for a long time; over 35
years we have been providing loans to the IMF. Also we have a
large shareholding,” al-Assaf said in a Bloomberg Television
interview in Davos, Switzerland. “We like to maintain that or
increase it.”  “I really cannot answer exactly who is going to contribute
and for that matter Saudi Arabia’s contribution,” al-Assaf
said.  The IMF, which co-finances loans to Greece, Ireland and
Portugal, identified a potential global financing need of $1
trillion in coming years and is seeking $500 billion in new
lending resources from its members to address potential loan
demand. To avoid a 1930s-style worldwide depression, IMF
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  has called on other
countries to contribute.  Mexican President Felipe Calderon also yesterday called for
more nations to raise funding for the IMF.  Next month’s meeting of the Group of 20 in Mexico will help
determine “some issues that have not been settled with regards
to the role of the Europeans versus the role of the rest of the
world,” al-Assaf said on the sidelines of the  World Economic
Forum .  To contact the reporters on this story:
