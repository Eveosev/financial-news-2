European Union regulators dropped an
antitrust probe into Les Laboratoires Servier for hampering an
investigation into potential antitrust violations by companies
seeking to keep cheaper generic medicine out of the EU market.  Servier,  France ’s second-largest drugmaker, was accused in
2010 of providing “misleading and incorrect” information
during a probe into the pharmaceutical industry over possible
delays to generic versions of patented medicines.  The European Commission closed the case because Servier’s
arguments “would require significant further investigation”
and would “instead focus” on competition concerns raised by
“a number of pending cases, including one involving Servier,”
according to an e-mailed statement today.  The Brussels-based antitrust agency started a probe of the
pharmaceutical industry in January 2008. In a  report  in 2009, it
found that companies use a variety of techniques to delay the
introduction of generics “for as long as possible.”  This decision “confirms Servier’s position and contradicts
the allegations of dissimulation that were made against the
group at the time,” said Lucy Vincent, a spokeswoman for the
Neuilly-sur-Seine, France-based company in a telephone interview
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
