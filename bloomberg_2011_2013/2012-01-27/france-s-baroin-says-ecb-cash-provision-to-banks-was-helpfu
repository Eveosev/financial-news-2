French Finance Minister  Francois
Baroin  said the  European Central Bank ’s injection of unlimited
cash to euro-region lenders helped fight the crisis.  “The ECB is considered independent,” he said at a panel
at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland , today. “The
unlimited liquidity for banks for three years has significantly
reduced” tensions “and will be an important step to help
restore confidence.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
