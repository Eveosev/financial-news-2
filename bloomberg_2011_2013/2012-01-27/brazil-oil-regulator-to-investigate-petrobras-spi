Brazil ’s oil regulator will
investigate a spill that occurred yesterday at a terminal
operated by the shipping unit of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,
Brazil’s state-controlled oil producer.  The Agencia Nacional do Petroleo has assisted in the
cleaning up the oil that leaked at the Osorio terminal in
southern Brazil operated by Transpetro, the agency said in an e-
mailed statement.  About 1.2 cubic meters (317 gallons) of oil spilled
yesterday when a vessel was unloading the fuel at the terminal,
Transpetro said in a separate statement today. Transpetro has
cleaned oil from the beach near the terminal and there aren’t
any signs of remaining oil in the water, it said.  Brazil has increased scrutiny of oil operations after the
2010 spill at the Macondo well in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico .
Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
produces about 90 percent of its oil from offshore fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
