The rate of union membership in the
U.S. fell to a record low in 2011 for a second-straight year, as
a loss of government jobs partially offset a rise in private-
sector employees, the Labor Department said.  Labor unions represented 6.9 percent of employees in
private companies, unchanged from 2010 and down from 7.2 percent
in 2009, according to  data  released today by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. The rate in the public sector was 37 percent.  The total union membership rate -- reflecting both public
and private-sector workers -- was 11.8 percent, down from 11.9
percent in 2010. The number of unionized workers went up by
about 50,000, to 14.8 million.  “We may have reached a level where the union numbers
simply can’t decline anymore, but if you’re not expanding, how
can you call yourself a movement?”  Gary Chaison , a labor
professor at  Clark University  in Worcester,  Massachusetts , said
in a telephone interview. “Unions simply can’t make any gains
in the private sector because it’s so expensive to organize. In
the public sector, the layoffs of teachers and firefighters are
really where the  labor movement  is hurting.”  Education Leads  Workers in education, training and library occupations had
the highest unionization rate, the Labor Department said. Among
states,  New York  again had the highest union membership rate at
24 percent, while  North Carolina  had the lowest, at 2.9 percent.  The  report  also showed the average weekly earnings of union
workers was $938, while non-union workers were paid $729.  In 1983, the first year the agency collected the data, 20.1
percent of the U.S. workforce and 16.8 percent of company
workers were members of a union.  The number of private-sector workers who are represented by
a union rose to 7.2 million from 7.1 million last year, while in
the public sector it fell 61,000 to 7.6 million.  “Despite an unprecedented volley of partisan political
attacks on workers’ rights and the continuing insecurity of our
economic crisis, union membership increased slightly last
year,”  Richard Trumka , the AFL-CIO’s president, said in a
statement. “It is telling that our country begins to recover
the jobs lost during the Great Recession, good union jobs are
beginning to come back.”  The number of government workers fell to 20.5 million, from
21 million, the Labor Department said.  The number of union workers who are black increased
slightly, to 1.92 million, or 13.5 percent, from 1.89 million,
or 13.4 percent. The number of Latino union workers rose about
6,000 to 1.82 million, though their percentage of the workforce
fell to 9.7 percent from 10 percent as nearly a half million
more Latinos were employed, according to the Labor Department
statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
