Russia ’s  Finance Ministry  will
prepare legislation this year allowing it to collect tax on
interest paid out on international bonds.  The plan, which has been criticized by lenders including
VTB Group and Barclays Plc, won’t apply to bondholders from
countries which have a prior agreement with Russia and won’t be
levied on Eurobonds issued before Jan. 1 2012, according to a
 statement  on the ministry’s website.  Ministry officials held talks on the proposed levy
yesterday, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said.  The tax could cost issuers of Eurobonds an estimated $1.5
billion a year on the total $100 billion of outstanding
international debt in Russia, according to a research note e-
mailed today from  Alfa Bank , the country’s biggest private
lender.  “We have received assurances from the  Finance Ministry 
that the issue will be resolved in the shortest period of
time,” Bella Zlatkis -- deputy chairman of OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s biggest lender -- said by phone on Jan. 27.  -- Editor: Emma O’Brien  To contact the reporter on this story:
