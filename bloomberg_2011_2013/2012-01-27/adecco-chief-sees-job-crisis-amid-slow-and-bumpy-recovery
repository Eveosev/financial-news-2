Europe  is in the midst of an 
employment crisis and has no immediate prospect of recovery, 
the head of  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest provider of temporary
workers, said today.  “We have a job crisis here, a job crisis which isn’t going
to be solved easily,” Patrick de Maeseneire told Bloomberg News
in an interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
 Switzerland . “We have the expectation of a mild recession. The
recovery will be very slow and bumpy.”  In Europe, the source of around two-thirds of Glattbrugg,
Switzerland-based Adecco’s revenue, unemployment has risen in
the past year. In countries that use the euro, it has either
increased or remained steady for eight consecutive months from
9.9 percent in March 2011 to 10.3 percent in November, the most
recent European Union data show.  Nearly half of Adecco’s income is from finding jobs for
low-skilled industrial workers, and that sector will suffer as
the economy continues to falter, De Maeseneire said.  “Industrial staffing is the most volatile,” he said.
“It’s the first that goes down” in a recession.  To contact the reporters on this story:
