House Republicans investigating the
collapse of Solyndra LLC asked Defense Secretary Leon Panetta to
turn over documents relating to the solar-panel maker.  Representatives  Fred Upton , a Michigan Republican and
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and  Cliff
Stearns , a Florida Republican who heads the committeeâ€™s
investigations subcommittee, are seeking communications
between the Defense Department and the company, its investors,
and the White House by Feb. 7, according to a letter sent today
and released by the lawmakers.  Solyndra received a $535 million U.S. loan guarantee from
the Energy Department and filed for bankruptcy two years later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
