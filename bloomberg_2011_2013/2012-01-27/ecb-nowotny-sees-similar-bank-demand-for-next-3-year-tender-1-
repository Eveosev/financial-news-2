European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny expects the ECB’s next unlimited
offer of three-year loans to banks will be used to a similar
extent as the first one, he was quoted as saying today.  “Due to the enormous refinancing needs, I assume that the
tender will be used similarly well as last time,” Nowotny told
Austrian daily newspaper Die Presse in an interview. He added
that final usage of the tender would depend on banks’ demand.  Europe ’s banks tapped the Frankfurt-based central bank for
489 billion euros ($645 billion) of three-year money in
December, with another tender scheduled for February, according
to the ECB.  Nowotny, who expects 2012 inflation to be “clearly” below
percent, said that he doesn’t expect the additional liquidity to
create an “inflation problem,” according to the report. Still,
the ECB is on constant alert on inflation, he told the Vienna-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
