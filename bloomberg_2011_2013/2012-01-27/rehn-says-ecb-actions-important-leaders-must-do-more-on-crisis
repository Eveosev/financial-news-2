European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said while the European Central
Bank’s actions have been “important,” more needs to be done to
fight the region’s fiscal crisis.  “I find the ECB actions very important in order to avoid a
credit crunch and to facilitate some more favourable bond
auctions such as of Italy and Spain,” Rehn said at the  World
Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland, today. “The ECB actions
are important but not enough and that’s why we need to have the
focus on a new fiscal compact. We need stronger financial
firewalls. I expect it to come to a positive conclusion.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
