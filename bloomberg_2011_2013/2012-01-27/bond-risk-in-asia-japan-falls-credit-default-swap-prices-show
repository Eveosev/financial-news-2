The cost of protecting bonds in Asia
and  Japan  against non-payment dropped, according to credit-
default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 1 basis point to 180.5 as of
8:13 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index declined 1 basis point to 160
as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
gauge is set for its lowest close since Sept. 16, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index is traded at 155 basis
points as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. Thatâ€™s up by 2.1 basis points from 152.9 yesterday,
according to CMA prices in  New York . Australian market was
closed yesterday due to a holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
