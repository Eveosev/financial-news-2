Bulgaria  will resume power exports
to south-east European countries tonight after the end of a coal
miners strike that forced a halt to electricity exports.  Bulgaria will resume electricity exports from 1 a.m. on
Jan. 28 after they were stopped to ensure domestic consumption
on Jan. 21. Continuation of exports was possible only after coal
reserves were replenished at the country’s  power plants , the
ministry said. Miners at Bulgaria’s Maritsa East mining region,
which produces 90 percent of the country’s coal, ended an 8-day
strike on Jan. 22 after agreeing to bonus payments.  Bulgaria sells electricity to other Balkan countries
including  Greece , Serbia, Romania, Albania and Macedonia, where
a drought reduced power output from hydro plants. The country
ships around 800 megawatts of power a day, according to the
Electricity System Operator in Sofia. Bulgaria sold a record 10
billion kilowatt hours last year, a 30 percent increase on 2010,
operator said.  The Maritsa East mines service three power plants,
including  AES (AES)  Galabovo AD, run by AES Corp. and the state-run
Maritsa East-2, ContourGlobal Maritsa East-3, which produce 25
percent of the country’s electricity output, according to their
website.  The country also relies on the Kozloduy nuclear power
plant, which produces about 40 percent of Bulgaria’s electricity
output.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
