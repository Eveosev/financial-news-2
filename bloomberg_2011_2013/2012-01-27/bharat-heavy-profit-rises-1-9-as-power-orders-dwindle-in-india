Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) ,
 India ’s biggest power-equipment maker, posted a 1.9 percent
increase in third-quarter profit, falling short of analysts’
estimates, as utilities reduced orders.  Net income  rose to 14.3 billion rupees ($290 million) in
the three months ended Dec. 31, from 14.03 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock
Exchange today. The average estimate of 30 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was a profit of 14.8 billion rupees.  India’s power utilities have shelved plans for $36 billion
in new plants because of soaring coal prices across  Asia ,
stalling efforts to boost generation capacity to cut blackouts
and drive expansion in Asia’s third-largest economy. State-owned
Bharat Heavy is seeking an increase in import duty on equipment
as it faces increasing competition from Chinese rivals.  “Bharat Heavy’s order book over the last two years points
to a slowdown as several orders are from utilities that have
financial closures pending or have uncertain access to fuel,”
Bhargav Buddhadev, vice president at Ambit Capital Pvt., said by
telephone before the earnings announcement. “Their market share
for equipment orders is being also being threatened by cheaper
and more efficient Chinese competitors.”  Bharat Heavy shares fell 3.1 percent to 273.60 rupees at
close in Mumbai trading, the biggest drop since Dec. 29. The
stock has declined 36 percent in the past 12 months compared
with a 7.8 percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive Index. The
earnings were announced after the market closed.  The equipment maker had 1.47 trillion rupees of orders in
hand as of Dec. 31, according to a statement. That compares with
1.58 trillion rupees of orders a year earlier. Sales rose 19
percent to 105.5 billion rupees.  -- Editors: John Chacko, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the reporter on this story:
