General Electric Capital Corp (GELK) ., the
financing unit of the world’s 10th-most-valuable publicly traded
company, is appointing staff to its structured finance team in
 Asia , said Eric Lee, a Singapore-based spokesman.  Craig White, joining as an executive director, will
establish a team responsible for all structured finance-related
activity, Lee said by phone today. White has held corporate-
finance roles in portfolio management, underwriting and business
analysis over the past eight years in GE Capital Australia,
according to Lee.  White will report to Shane Bennett, managing director of
risk and structured finance, in  Hong Kong , Lee said.  Steve Small, previously with GE Capital’s franchise finance
group, will report to White as associate director in Singapore,
according to Lee.  Erwan Stervinou was hired as a director on the company’s
structured finance team in Hong Kong, Lee said yesterday.
Stervinou started in the new role last week and reports to
Bennett and Brett Taylor,  executive director  of structured
finance. He was previously a leveraged-finance director at
United Overseas Bank Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
