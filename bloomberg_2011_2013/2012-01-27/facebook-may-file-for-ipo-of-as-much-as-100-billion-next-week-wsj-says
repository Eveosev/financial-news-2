Facebook Inc., the largest social-
networking site, may file for its initial public offering on
Feb. 1 and is close to hiring Morgan Stanley to handle the deal,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  The company is considering a valuation of $75 billion to
$100 billion, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will probably play a
“major role” in the IPO, the newspaper reported.  Facebook has been discussing raising $10 billion in a share
sale that would value it at $100 billion, a person with
knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News in November. That
would make it twice as valuable as it was in January 2011, when
the company announced a $1.5 billion investment from Goldman
Sachs and other backers.  Larry Yu, a spokesman for  Menlo Park ,  California-based
Facebook , declined to comment, as did representatives of Goldman 
Sachs and Morgan Stanley, both based in  New York .  Co-founded by  Mark Zuckerberg  in 2004 in a Harvard
University dorm room, Facebook has amassed more than 800 million
users with an easy-to-use website that lets anyone with an
Internet connection construct profile pages, post video and
photos and interact with friends. The company has nudged aside
competitors such as MySpace Inc. and generates sales from
advertisers as varied as AT&T Inc., Best Buy Co. and Sony Corp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
