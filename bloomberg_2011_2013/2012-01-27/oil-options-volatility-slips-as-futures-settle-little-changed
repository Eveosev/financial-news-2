Crude oil options volatility fell as
the underlying futures settled 14 cents lower, staying within
the trading range they have been in for a month.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.3 as of 3 p.m. in  New York , down from
27.9 yesterday.  “Volatility looks unchanged again today,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.
“Even though we’re bouncing around a little, we’re still in a
range.”  Crude for March delivery settled at $99.56 a barrel on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  after earlier touching $100.63.
Since Dec. 22, the front-month crude contract has traded in a
range of about $6, from a low of $97.40 to a high of $103.74.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, with 2,006 lots changing hands at 3:27 p.m. They
fell 2 cents to 97 cents. March $90 puts, the second-most active
option, declined 3 cents to 30 cents with 1,410 lots trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume
