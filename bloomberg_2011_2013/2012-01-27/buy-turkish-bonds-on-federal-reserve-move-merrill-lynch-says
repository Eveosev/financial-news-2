Investors should buy  Turkish local
bonds , Bank of America and Merrill Lynch said, citing a signal
by the  Federal Reserve  for quantitative easing that may prove a
“decisive” factor in attracting buyers back to the market.  Turkey’s economy is showing signs of adjustment as the
current-account deficit has already peaked and will narrow over
2012 as economic growth slows, strategists including Arko Sen
said in a report dated yesterday.  The Fed foresees “exceptionally low”  interest rates 
through 2014 and signaled this week that it may embark on
another program of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
