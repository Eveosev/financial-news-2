Samsung Electronics (005930)  Co. lost a
patent ruling in Germany in a mobile technology case brought
against  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , a week after judges rejected a similar bid
by the Suwon, South Korea-based company against the iPad maker.  The Regional Court in Mannheim rejected the suit today,
said Joachim Bock, a spokesman for the tribunal, in an
interview. Samsung said the ruling only relates to one of
several patents asserted and doesn’t indicate whether the court
may find Apple infringed other Samsung rights in Germany.  “We are disappointed that the court did not share our
views regarding the infringement by Apple of this specific
patent,” Samsung said in an e-mailed statement. “We will wait
for the written grounds of today’s judgment, and after thorough
review make a decision about a possible appeal.”  Germany  has become a key venue for the  lawsuits  between
Apple and Samsung over mobile technologies and designs since the
iPhone maker last year accused its South Korean rival of copying
products. Both litigants are awaiting a Dusseldorf appeals court
decision next week over the design of Samsung’s Galaxy Tablet
10.1. Today’s case addressed 3 telecommunications standards.  Apple has no specific comment on today’s ruling, said Alan Hely, a spokesman for the company, referring to an April
statement that it has to defend against Samsung’s “blatant
copying.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
