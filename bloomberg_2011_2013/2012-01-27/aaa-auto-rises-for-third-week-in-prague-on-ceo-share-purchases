AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) , a Czech chain of
used-car dealerships, rose for a third week toward a two-month
high as Chief Executive Officer Anthony Denny bought the
company’s shares on each trading day from Jan. 20 to Jan. 26.  The stock jumped as much as 2 percent before paring its
gain to 0.3 percent at 18.16 koruna by 3:03 p.m. in Prague,
extending this week’s rally to 3.1 percent. A close at that
level would be AAA Auto’s highest since Nov. 28.  Denny bought 5,769 company shares yesterday, the Amsterdam-
registered company said in a regulatory filing today, adding to
purchases of 336,679 shares over the previous four trading days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
