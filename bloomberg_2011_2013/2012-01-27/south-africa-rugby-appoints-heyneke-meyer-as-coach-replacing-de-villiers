Heyneke Meyer was named coach of the
 South Africa  rugby team, taking charge of the two-time world
champions until after the 2015  World Cup .  Meyer, 44, executive in charge of rugby at the Pretoria-
based Blue Bulls franchise, replaces Peter de Villiers, the
country’s first black national coach who said he would step down
after South Africa’s lost to  Australia  in the 2011 World Cup
quarterfinals.  Meyer, a former teacher who coached the Bulls to four
domestic Currie Cup titles between 2002 and 2006 and a Super 14
win in 2007, faces the challenge of increasing the number of
black players in the national team while maintaining its
competitiveness after the departure of World Cup-winning players
including former captain  John Smit , Victor Matfield and Fourie
du Preez.  “I truly realize winning is always the most important
thing,” Meyer told journalists in Cape Town after his
appointment was announced by the  South African Rugby Union .
“But I also realize the role that sport plays in this country
and I hope I will be able to make a difference.”  Meyer didn’t name his support staff, and said he hasn’t yet
made up his mind about who will captain the team.  South Africa is scheduled to play three test matches
against England at home in June, followed by the southern
hemisphere championship involving home-and-away matches against
Argentina, New Zealand and Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
