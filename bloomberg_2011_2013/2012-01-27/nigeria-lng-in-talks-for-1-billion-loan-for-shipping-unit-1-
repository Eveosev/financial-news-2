Nigeria  Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. (LNG) 
is in talks with international bankers to raise $1 billion in
funds to boost the LNG tanker fleet of its shipping subsidiary,
Bonny Gas Transport Ltd., a company official said.  A financial adviser for the transaction “would be
appointed in about a month,” Ifeanyi Mbanefo, a spokesman for
the Lagos-based company, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions without giving further details.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, is the holder of the
continent’s largest gas reserves of more than 187 trillion cubic
feet. Nigeria LNG operates a 22 million-ton-a-year LNG plant and
has long-term contracts with buyers in Italy, Spain, Turkey,
Portugal and  France . It also sells on the  spot market .  The LNG Adamawa, a tanker owned by the company, left the
Bonny Inshore Terminal on Dec. 29 and is signaling for  Japan  for
the first time in at least six years, according to AISLive Ltd.
ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria LNG “considers and performs diversions of LNG
cargoes to less traditional markets and terminals to serve the
demand to the mutual benefit of all parties,” Mbanefo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
