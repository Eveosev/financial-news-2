Peruvian bond yields headed for
their biggest two-day drop in eight weeks as bets  Greece  will
reach an agreement with its creditors and the U.S. Federal
Reserve will expand stimulus measures increased appetite for
higher-yielding, emerging market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.71 percent at 12:26 p.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That brought the
yield’s decline over the past two days to four basis points, the
most since Dec. 1. The security’s price rose 0.15 centimo from
yesterday to 114.23 centimos per sol.  Authorities are “very close” to reaching an agreement on
private-sector involvement for a Greek debt deal this month,
European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said today at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on Jan. 25 policy
makers will maintain cheap borrowing costs through 2014 and are
weighing additional stimulus to bring down the  unemployment
rate , including another round of bond buying.  “The Fed’s announcements about liquidity helped all risky
assets,” said Estefany Castillo, an analyst at Scotiabank Peru
in Lima. “The fall in yields also reflects Peru’s strong
fundamentals.”  Peru’s sol was unchanged at 2.6910 per  U.S. dollar  and is
little changed this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
