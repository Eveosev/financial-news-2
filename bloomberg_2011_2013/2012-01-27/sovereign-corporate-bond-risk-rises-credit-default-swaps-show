Portuguese credit-default swaps rose
to a record amid concern the government may seek to copy a
proposed Greek deal for private investors to take losses on
their bondholdings.  Credit-default swaps insuring $10 million of Portuguese
sovereign debt for five years rose to an all-time high of $3.95
million in advance and $100,000 annually, according to data
provider CMA at 11 a.m. in  London . The cost implies a 70 percent
chance the government will default in that time.  A Greek accord with private bondholders that would prompt
writedowns of more than 50 percent is “very close,” the
European Union’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said today in Davos,  Switzerland . A beneficiary of a 78
billion-euro ($103 billion) bailout,  Portugal  probably had
public debt representing 101.6 percent of GDP last year, the
fourth-highest in the EU, according to the European Commission.  “It appears that Portugal may have crossed the Rubicon in
the eyes of the market,” said  Gary Jenkins , the director of
independent credit firm Swordfish Research in London. “A
negotiated settlement in  Greece  might become a template for
Portugal in how to deal with their debt, which wouldn’t be good
news for investors.”  Portugal’s 10-year bonds yield 14.8 percent, while the two-
year notes are at 16.5 percent.  Company, Bank Debt  The cost of insuring corporate debt was little changed
before a report that may show economic growth in the U.S.
quickened. Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell one basis
point to 603, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 1.5 basis points to 141.5. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers weakened one basis point to 212 and the
subordinated gauge was 5.5 higher at 375.5.  The  U.S. economy  probably grew in the fourth quarter at the
fastest pace of 2011, a Bloomberg survey said before a Commerce
Department report today. Gross domestic product, the value of
all goods and services produced, grew at a 3 percent annual pace
after advancing 1.8 percent in the previous three months,
according to the median forecast of 79 economists.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments was unchanged at 322.5 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
