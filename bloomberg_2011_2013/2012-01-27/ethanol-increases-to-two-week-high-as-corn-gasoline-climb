Ethanol futures increased to the
highest price in more than two weeks as corn and gasoline
advanced.  Futures gained for the seventh straight day after a U.S.
Agriculture Department report showed farmers withheld corn from
exporters to secure higher prices. Gasoline surged to a five-
month high on speculation that refinery closures in  North
America  and  Europe  will hamper supply.  “Ethanol rose, but it didn’t rise as much as it should
have with corn and gasoline up,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
Biofuelsconnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery climbed 1 cent, or
0.5 percent, to $2.197 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest level since Jan. 11. Prices have gained 4 percent
since Jan. 18 and fallen 4.8 percent in the past year.  Damask said ethanol didn’t rise as much as gasoline and
corn because of a supply glut.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  gained 1.4 percent to 19.8 million barrels in
the week ended Jan. 20, the highest level since May 27 and a
seventh consecutive increase, the longest such streak since Jan.
21, according to Energy Department data.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  added 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.265 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive jumped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.245,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.155 a
gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel advanced 1 cent, or 0.4
percent, to $2.26.  Gasoline for February delivery surged 8.02 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $2.9268 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract includes reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery soared 7.25 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $6.4175 a bushel in  Chicago . One such unit makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
