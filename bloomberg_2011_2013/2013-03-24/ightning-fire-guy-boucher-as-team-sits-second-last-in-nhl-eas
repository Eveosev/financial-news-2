The  Tampa Bay Lightning  fired coach
Guy Boucher after dropping to second-last place in the  National
Hockey League ’s Eastern Conference standings.  Boucher, 41, was released the morning after the Lightning
conceded four goals in the opening period of a 5-3 loss to the
 Ottawa Senators . Assistant coaches Martin Raymond and Dan Lacroix will oversee tonight’s game against the Winnipeg Jets
(16-14-2, 34 points).  “ I’m not satisfied with the direction we are heading,”
Lightning General Manager Steve Yzerman said in a  statement  on
the team’s website. “Making a change today is in the best
interest of our franchise.”  Tampa Bay is fourth-last in the NHL with a 13-17-1 record
and 27 points. The Lightning missed the playoffs last year after
reaching the conference finals in 2011, Boucher’s first season
as a coach in the NHL.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
