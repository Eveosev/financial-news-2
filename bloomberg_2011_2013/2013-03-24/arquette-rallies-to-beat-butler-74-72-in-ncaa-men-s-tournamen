Marquette University rallied to a 74-72 win to eliminate  Butler
University  from the national men’s basketball tournament.  Davante Gardner’s two free throws in the final four seconds
secured the win for Marquette, seeded third in the East region,
at Lexington, Kentucky.   Trent Lockett and Jamil Wilson each scored 13 points and
Gardner had eight for Marquette (25-8).  Rotnei Clarke had 24 points and  Andrew Smith  scored 17 for
the sixth-seeded Bulldogs (27-9), who had a 35-27 halftime lead.  Marquette next goes to the regional semifinal where it will
meet the winner of tomorrow’s game between Illinois and Miami.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
