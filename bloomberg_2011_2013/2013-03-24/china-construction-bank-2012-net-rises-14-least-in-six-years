China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
worldâ€™s second-largest lender by market value, posted its
slowest profit growth in six years as the slowing economy curbed
demand for financial services.  Net income rose 14 percent to 193.2 billion  yuan  ($31.1
billion) in 2012, or 0.77 yuan a share, from 169.3 billion yuan,
or 0.68 yuan, a year earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange today. That exceeded
the 192.7 billion yuan average estimate of 29 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
