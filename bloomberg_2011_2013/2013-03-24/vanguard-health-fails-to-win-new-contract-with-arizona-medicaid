Vanguard Health Systems Inc. (VHS) , an
operator of hospitals and health plans controlled by Blackstone
Group LP, failed to win a new contract with  Arizona ’s Medicaid
agency to provide acute patient care.  Vanguard’s Phoenix Health Plan, a Medicaid managed health
plan with 186,200 members in Arizona, was notified March 22 that
it wasn’t awarded a contract by the Arizona Health Care Cost
Containment System, the Nashville, Tennessee-based company said
today in a statement. The current contract expires on Sept. 30,
and it was seeking a contract beginning Oct. 1.  Phoenix Health made up about 80 percent of the company’s
$369.7 million in revenue from its health plans segment in the
six months ended Dec. 31, according to the statement and a
regulatory filing. The company had $2.9 billion in consolidated
revenue during the period.  Phoenix Health Plan members comprise 79 percent of
Vanguard’s 236,000 members in five health plans, according to
the filing. Membership in the plan was down from an average of
205,000 patients in the six months ended Dec. 31, 2011.  Keith Pitts, vice chairman at Vanguard, declined to comment
beyond the statement. No representative of Arizona Medicaid
could be reached today outside normal business hours.  The company has until April 1 to file a protest, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
