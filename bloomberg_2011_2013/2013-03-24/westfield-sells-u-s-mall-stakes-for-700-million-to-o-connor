Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s
biggest shopping center operator by assets, said it sold half
shares in six malls in Florida to O’Connor  Capital Partners  for
about $700 million.  Westfield agreed to  sell  a 49.9 percent interest in the
malls at book value, valuing the joint venture with the  New York 
based real estate investment and development company at about
$1.3 billion, the Sydney-based company said in a statement to
the Australian stock exchange. Westfield will continue to
manage, develop and lease the properties, it said.  “This agreement carries on the group’s strategy of
introducing joint venture partners into our assets globally as
well as disposing of non-core assets,” Westfield co-Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Lowy , said in the statement.  The transaction will dilute Westfield’s 2013 funds from
operations by about 1 cent per security, it said. The dilution
will be offset when the company reinvests the capital raised, it
said.  The sale is expected to be completed by the end of the
second quarter, it said.  Westfield shares have climbed 1.9 percent this year,
compared with a 6.9 percent gain in the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
