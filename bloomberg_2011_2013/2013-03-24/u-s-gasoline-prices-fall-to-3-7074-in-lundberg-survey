The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 3.2 cents a gallon in the past two
weeks to $3.7074 cents, according to  Lundberg Survey Inc.   The survey for the period ended March 22 was based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company, the company said. It was
the second consecutive biweekly decline after nine weeks of
price increases.  Since Dec. 21, the average has risen about 44.95 cents a
gallon. It is 22.23 cents below the year-ago price of $3.9297.  “It seems fairly likely we will see a bit more price-
cutting at the pump, another drop from here in the next few days
of a similar amount” to the 3.2 cents, Trilby Lundberg,
president of Lundberg Survey, said yesterday in a phone
interview, pointing to falling prices of the U.K. crude
benchmark Brent.  “Those prices have been substantially weakened, and they
are an important input to U.S. refinery purchase prices of
crude,” Lundberg said.  Gasoline futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
14.1 cents, or 4.4 percent, to $3.0625 a gallon in the two weeks
ended March 22. Futures have climbed 8.9 percent this year.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles  fell 1.48 million barrels in the
week ended March 15 to 222.8 million, the lowest level in three
months, according to data from the  Energy Information
Administration , the U.S. Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Year-Ago Demand  Gasoline  demand  over the past four weeks, measured by
deliveries to wholesalers, was 1.5 percent above a year ago.  West Texas Intermediate oil on the Nymex rose $1.76, or
1.9 percent, to $93.71 a barrel in the two weeks to March 22.
Prices have climbed 2.1 percent this year.  Crude  inventories  fell 1.31 million barrels in the week
ended March 15 to 382.7 million, the first decline in nine
weeks, according to data from the EIA. Supplies at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for the Nymex futures contract,
fell 0.6 percent to 49 million barrels, a 13-week low.  Oil will probably fall next week on concern that slower
European growth may weaken the U.S. economy and fuel demand, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Fifteen of 31 analysts, or 48 percent, forecast crude will
drop through March 29. Nine respondents, or 29 percent,
predicted a gain. Seven said there would be little change. Last
week, 45 percent of analysts projected a decrease.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
markets surveyed was in  Chicago , where the average was $4.10 a
gallon, Lundberg said. The lowest price was in Billings,
 Montana , where customers paid an average of $3.33 a gallon.  Regular gasoline on Long Island, New York, averaged $3.94 a
gallon, according to Lundberg. Drivers in Los Angeles paid an
average of $4.09.  To contact the reporters on this story:
