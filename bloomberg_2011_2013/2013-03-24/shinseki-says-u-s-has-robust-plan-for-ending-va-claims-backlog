U.S.  Veterans Affairs  Secretary
Eric Shinseki said President  Barack Obama ’s administration has a
plan in place to eliminate a 600,000-case backlog in veterans’
disability and compensation claims by 2015.  The Department of Veterans Affairs is addressing the
backlog as it makes the transition to digital processing from
paper in the wake of two wars and decisions that have increased
the number and complexity of claims, Shinseki said today in an
interview on CNN’s “ State of the Union ” program.  “We have put in place a robust plan to end the backlog in
2015; that’s been our commitment,” Shinseki said in the
interview. “We’ve put 3 million claims out the door. If you
have an inventory of about 875,000, a million claims decisions
going out a year, you know we’re taking care of business.”  Shinseki, 60, was responding to complaints that wounded
troops are being required to wait for the help they need because
of delays in reviewing their claims. Since Shinseki set a goal
of resolving disability claims within 125 days with 98 percent
accuracy in 2009, the backlog has grown and the error rate has
increased.  “The president has been very clear, veterans are a top
priority with him, and ending the backlog is foremost in his
mind,” Shinseki said today. “In the past four years, if you
look at our budgets for VA, a 40 percent increase to our budgets
at a time when other departments have gone through belt-
tightening. Someone once told me that show me your budget and
I’ll show you what’s your value.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
