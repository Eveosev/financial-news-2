At least 25 people were killed in
gun and bomb attacks on government and residential buildings in
the northern Nigerian city of Ganye, police said.  The gunmen simultaneously attacked a police station, a
prison, an area court, a local government secretariat and some
residential buildings late March 22, Mohammed Ibrahim, a Adamawa
State police spokesman said yesterday by phone from the city.  “We lost a police officer and prison security official
while the rest of the 23 killed were civilians,” he said.  The Islamist group Boko Haram been carrying out attacks in
the north and the capital Abuja since 2009 as part of a campaign
to impose Shariah law in  Africa ’s top oil producer. The most
populous African nation, with more than 160 million people, is
divided between a largely Muslim north and mostly Christian
south.  About 22 were killed and 65 wounded on March 18 when
suspected Boko Haram members attacked a bus station in Kano’s
Sabon Gari district.  ---With assistance from Emele Onu in Lagos. Editor: Riad Hamade  To contact the reporter on this story:
