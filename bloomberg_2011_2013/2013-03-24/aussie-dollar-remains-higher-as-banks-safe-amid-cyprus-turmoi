The Australian dollar remained
higher, maintaining three weeks of gains, as investors
speculated the nation’s banks will be untouched by concerns in
 Europe  that bank deposits are under threat.  New Zealand’s currency traded 0.1 percent from its highest
this month even as markets awaited a decision on whether Cyprus
will receive the bailout needed to avert financial collapse. The
Cypriot parliament rejected a tax on all bank accounts on the
island last week, forcing the nation to hunt for other sources
to contribute to the rescue package.  “You saw a bit of safe-haven buying last week and, given
that our bank ratings are still among the highest in the world,
investors are looking favorably on  Australia  and New Zealand,”
said Tim Kelleher, ASB Institutional, a unit of Commonwealth
Bank of Australia in Auckland. “The likes of  Canada  and
Australia, and as a result New Zealand, would probably see an
influx of deposits if things worsen in Europe and that would be
supportive for the currencies.”  The Australian dollar bought $1.0450 as of 9:52 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0444 in New York last week, when it gained 0.3
percent. It rose as high as $1.0460 on March 22, the strongest
since Jan. 30. The Aussie fetched 98.83 yen from 98.67 on March
22. New Zealand’s currency bought 83.55 U.S. cents from 83.58 in
New York and touched 83.63 cents on March 22, the most since
Feb. 25. It bought 79.03 yen from 78.97.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and Commonwealth Bank of Australia,
the nation’s two largest lenders, are the biggest publicly
traded banks worldwide to hold a credit score of AA- or higher
from Standard & Poor’s, the ratings company’s fourth-highest
grade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures traders boosted bets the Australian dollar will
rise against the greenback by the most in nine months.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on an advance in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was
54,055 on March 19, compared with net longs of 23,266 a week
earlier, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
