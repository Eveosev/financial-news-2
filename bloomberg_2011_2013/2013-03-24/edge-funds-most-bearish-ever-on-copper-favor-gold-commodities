Hedge funds  are making the biggest
bet against copper on record as global inventories expand to a
nine-year high, while concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
spread spurred the biggest gain in gold bets since 2008.  Speculators raised net-short  positions  in U.S. copper
futures and options by 53 percent to 25,719 contracts in the
week ended March 19, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data that begins in 2006. A jump in bullish bets on
corn, gold and natural gas boosted overall holdings across 18
raw materials for a second consecutive week.  Copper prices are heading for a second consecutive monthly
loss in what would be the longest slump since the end of 2011.
Stockpiles monitored by exchanges in London, Shanghai and  New
York  stand at about 873,000 metric tons, or almost five months
of North American demand, and Barclays Plc is forecasting a
second annual surplus. Gold climbed for three weeks, the longest
rally in six months, amid turmoil over Cyprus’s efforts to win a
bailout to avert its financial collapse.  “We’re sitting on unprecedented stockpiles of copper and
other metals,” said  Jack Ablin , the chief investment officer of
BMO Private Bank in  Chicago , which oversees about $66 billion of
assets. “Demand has been pretty tepid for industrial metals. In
the global economy, we’re seeing improving growth, but it’s
still at a slow rate.”  Copper dropped 1.5 percent to $3.466 a pound on the Comex
last week, the biggest retreat in a month. The Standard & Poor’s
GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities fell 0.9 percent. The MSCI
All-Country World Index of equities declined 1.1 percent and the
dollar rose 0.1 percent against a basket of six major trading
partners. Treasuries returned 0.4 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  LME Stockpiles  Inventories of copper monitored by the London Metal
Exchange jumped 77 percent this year to 565,350 tons, the
highest since October 2003. Supplies tracked by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange are at the highest since the data begins in
January 2003. Chinese  imports  of the refined metal declined in
February to the lowest in 19 months, while exports rose for a
sixth month, government figures showed March 21.  Prices dropped along with most commodities last week as
Cyprus neared the brink of financial collapse, reviving concern
that  Europe ’s debt crisis will erode global growth. The
continent accounts for 18 percent of copper demand, Barclays
estimates. Overnight, Cyprus dodged a disorderly default and
unprecedented exit from the euro currency by bowing to demands
to shrink its banking system in exchange for a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) bailout.  Air Conditioners  Sales of air conditioners and orders for electrical
equipment suggest improving demand in  China , Rachel Zhang, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley in  Hong Kong , said in a report last
week. The nation’s passenger-vehicle market rose 20 percent to
2.84 million units in January and February in the strongest
start since 2010. The transportation industry accounts for about
11 percent of the country’s copper use and household appliances
15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  “The risk appetite has certainly improved over the last
several months,” said Nelson Louie, the global head of
commodities at New York-based Credit Suisse Asset Management,
who helps manage $11.3 billion. “The overall  U.S. economy  has
shown resilience, and China seems to be improving as well.”  Investors withdrew a net $929 million from commodity funds
in the week ended March 20, said  Cameron Brandt , the director of
research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based researcher EPFR
Global, which tracks money flows. Gold and precious metals had
an outflow of $978 million.  Gold Gains  Gold prices have risen 1.8 percent in March, heading for
the first monthly gain since September. The metal is still down
4.1 percent this year as the U.S. unemployment rate fell and
assets in exchange-traded  products  backed by gold dropped 6.7
percent. Investors increased their bullish bets by 63 percent to
70,193 contracts, the biggest expansion since September 2008.  The precious metal has jumped 81 percent since the end of
2008 as central bank measures intended to stimulate economic
growth increased speculation that inflation will accelerate. The
 Federal Reserve  on March 20 left unchanged plans to hold its
target interest rate near zero percent as long as U.S.
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The jobless rate last
month was 7.7 percent.  Money managers increased their bullish  bets  on natural gas
to 46,148 contracts, from 2,995 a week earlier, the CFTC data
show. Oil wagers climbed 3.2 percent to 172,268 contracts, and
those for gasoline rose 1.4 percent to 77,801 contracts. Natural
gas advanced 18 percent this year as production gains slowed and
cold weather bolstered heating demand.  Farm Bets  A  measure  of speculative positions across 11 agricultural
products from wheat to coffee to cattle increased 9.1 percent to
265,475 contracts, the highest since Feb. 12.  Wagers on higher corn prices increased 66 percent to
145,535 contracts, the biggest gain since July 2010. Speculators
reduced their negative outlook for wheat to 33,457 contracts
from a net-short position of 41,519 a week earlier.  Corn stockpiles before the next harvest will fall to 632
million bushels, the lowest since 1996, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said March 8. The agency raised its forecast for use
of the grain in  animal feed  by 2.2 percent to 4.55 million
bushels. Soybean inventories may drop to the lowest since 2004.  “Prices are going to be driven by supply-and-demand
considerations and technical factors for each commodity,” said
Walter ‘Bucky’ Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets
at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,  Alabama . “Crop
inventories are creating support in prices for corn. The copper
flows show there are still doubts about global growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
