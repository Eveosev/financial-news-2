China’s swap market is signaling
interest-rate increases for the first time since 2011 after
inflation accelerated to a 10-month high and the housing market
defied government cooling efforts.  Two-year contracts that exchange the People’s Bank of
China’s 3 percent savings benchmark for a fixed payment rose 
eight basis points this month to 3.03 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The swap had been lower than the one-year PBOC
deposit  rate  for 16 months. Of the 27 economists surveyed this
month by Bloomberg, 13 predicted higher rates in 2013, with
Credit Agricole CIB, Daiwa Capital Markets and Nomura Holdings
Inc. forecasting two increases.  PBOC Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said on March 13 the
government should be on “high alert” after consumer prices
jumped a more-than-forecast 3.2 percent in February. Data last
week showed new home prices last month posted the broadest
advance since December 2011. China’s 10-year bond yield is 38
basis points higher than inflation, compared with a similar U.S.
real yield of minus 8 basis points.  “The rising inflation trend and upward pressure on home
prices will continue, forcing the central bank to tighten,”
said Dariusz Kowalczyk, senior economist and strategist with
Credit Agricole in Hong Kong. “Main lending rates will be hiked
to reduce inflation expectations.”  Inflation will probably quicken to 4 percent in the second
half, a level that will “really concern” the central bank,
said Kowalczyk, who accurately predicted the February consumer-
price gain. He forecasts two deposit rate increases after June
to 3.5 percent to protect returns on savings.  Building Pressure  The central bank lowered its benchmark savings rate twice
by a quarter of a percentage point in 2012 and swap traders were
betting in July there would be a further four reductions within
a year. The two-year deposit-rate swap reached as low as 2.46
percent on July 25. Buyers of the contract receive the current
deposit rate for one year, after which the floating payment is
reset for the second year at the prevailing rate.  Benchmark borrowing costs are all above returns on
deposits. The yield on the 3.52 percent sovereign notes due
February 2023 dropped two basis points last week to 3.57
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center. The one-year
interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to receive the
floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell one basis point to 3.28
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The PBOC drained 47 billion yuan ($7.6 billion) from the
financial system last week through repurchase operations,
bringing total net  withdrawals  to 1 trillion yuan in the past
five weeks.  Food Prices  Living-cost indicators were distorted by a weeklong holiday
that ended Feb. 15. China’s  February inflation  was driven in
part by a 6 percent gain in food prices, the fastest pace in
nine months. Non-food prices gained 1.9 percent, the most in 14
months, the statistics bureau reported on March 9.  “Food-price increases are largely driven by the Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday, while the accelerated gain in non-food
items indicates inflation is becoming broad-based and pressure
is building,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief China economist at
Nomura in Hong Kong.  The consumer price index may rise to 3.4 percent in the
third quarter before reaching 3.6 percent in the final three
months of 2013, according to the median forecasts in a Bloomberg
survey of economists between March 15 and March 20. The
government set an annual inflation goal of 3.5 percent at the
start of this year’s National People’s Congress, down from last
year’s target of 4 percent.  Rate Reductions  Zhou, reappointed this month as PBOC governor, said on
March 13 that monetary policy is “no longer relaxed” and is
“relatively neutral.” Interest rates will probably remain
unchanged in the first half while an increase in the second half
is possible, Song Guoqing, an academic adviser to the central
bank, said on March 19 at a forum in Hong Kong.  A PBOC quarterly survey released that day showed more
Chinese residents are finding property prices too high and
“hard to accept.” Statistics bureau data last week showed new-
home prices climbed in 62 of 70 cities monitored by the
government in February.  The nation is still dealing with the fallout from 17.6
trillion  yuan  of stimulus loans that flooded the economy between
2009 and 2010 to help it withstand the global financial crisis.
Authorities this month ordered stricter enforcement of taxes on
house sales, along with higher down payments and interest rates
for second-home mortgages in cities with “excessively fast”
price gains.  Asset-Price Bubbles  “Zhou is shifting the monetary policy from loose to
neutral to fend off the inflation and asset-price bubbles,”
said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities
Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong. “But a rate hike now will be considered
too hawkish as the central bank is aware that the economic
recovery is not in a solid foundation yet.”  Data this month showed Chinese retail sales and industrial
output had the weakest combined start to a year since 2009 while
new local-currency loans were lower than forecast in February.
Concern the economic rebound is losing steam may have eased
after the preliminary reading of a private Purchasing Managers’
Index released on March 21 climbed to 51.7 this month, signaling
faster expansion in manufacturing.  China ’s economy expanded 7.9 percent in the final three
months of last year, ending a seven-quarter deceleration. Growth
may accelerate to 8.1 percent this quarter before reaching 8.2
percent in each of the next two quarters, according to the
Bloomberg surveys.  Rate Outlook  Mizuho’s Shen now sees the central bank increasing the
deposit rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, in
the fourth quarter, after last predicting in February that the
rate will stay unchanged at 3 percent this year. He joins 12
other economists in forecasting higher rates in this month’s
survey, up from nine out of 23 economists in December.  The cost of insuring China’s debt against non-payment with
credit-default swaps rose 6.5 basis points to 68 basis points
last week, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. The yuan rose 0.02 percent last
week to close at 6.2122 per dollar in  Shanghai , prices from
China Foreign Exchange Trade System show. It touched 6.2113 on
March 20, the strongest level since 1993.  Expectations for faster inflation are driving State Street
Global Advisors, which manages around $2 trillion, to
underweight Chinese sovereign bonds.  “At this point in time, we wouldn’t be overweight Chinese
yuan bonds since economic growth is expected to be higher than
last year and inflation to rise further,” Ng Kheng Siang,
Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at State
Street, said in an interview on March 20.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
