Apple Inc. (AAPL) , whose mapping software
has been criticized for misguided directions and inaccurate
landmark, bought startup WiFiSLAM to add location-identifying
technology for when a user is inside a building.   “Apple acquires smaller technology companies from time to
time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans,”
said Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, confirming the deal.  The purchase is among several Apple has made in recent
years to improve its navigation capabilities as it competes with
Google Inc. Last year, Cupertino, California-based Apple
introduced its own mapping software to replace Google’s, a
switch that resulted in user complaints and negative reviews.
Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  apologized and vowed to
improve the service.   WiFiSLAM, based in Palo Alto, California, is part of a
group of companies helping users find a location when they are
inside a building like a grocery store or shopping mall. Google
also has been creating maps for indoor locations like museums.  To contact the reporter on this story:
