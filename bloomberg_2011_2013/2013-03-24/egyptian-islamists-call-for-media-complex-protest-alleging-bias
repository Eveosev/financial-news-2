Egyptian Islamist groups have
called for a demonstration today outside Cairo’s main media
complex to protest what they say is media bias.  The call follows March 22 clashes between opponents and
supporters of President Mohamed Mursi that wounded at least 200
people, amid mounting anger at the Islamist-backed leader.  Former Salafi presidential candidate and Al-Raya Party
leader Hazem Salah Abu Ismail posted on his Facebook page a call
for protests outside the  Egyptian Media Production City (MPRC) , where
most satellite television studios are housed. He also urged
Egyptians to “peacefully lay siege” to the headquarters of
liberal parties and the houses of liberal opposition leaders.  Secularist and youth activists accuse Mursi of working to
cement Islamist rule. They say Mohammed Badie, the Muslim
Brotherhood’s top official, known as the Supreme Guide, is
running the country behind the scenes. The Muslim Brotherhood
backed Mursi’s presidential candidacy.  “Some people want to set  Egypt  on fire because they
realize full well they cannot achieve any victory through
elections, and because they have neither the intention nor the
inclination to offer serious programs or development projects,”
Murad Ali, spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party, the
Muslim Brotherhood’s media arm, said on the group’s website.
“Their program is to drag the country into violence and
destruction, their project is to thwart any attempt of
development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
