Thailand’s Kiradech Aphibarnrat
scored a final-round 70, 2-under par, to win golf’s Malaysian
Open by one shot today, his first European Tour victory.  Aphibarnrat finished on 13-under in Kuala Lumpur, ahead of
Italy’s Edoardo Molinari, with Anders Hansen of Denmark a shot
further back. The tournament was reduced to three rounds because
of thunderstorms and there was a further weather delay for the
final playing group at the 16th hole today.  Aphibarnrat picked up a check for 350,410 euros ($455,000).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
