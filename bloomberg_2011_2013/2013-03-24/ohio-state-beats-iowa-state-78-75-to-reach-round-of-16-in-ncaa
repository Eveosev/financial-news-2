Florida Gulf Coast University made
college basketball history as the first No. 15 regional seed to
reach the final 16 at the National Collegiate Athletic
Association men’s tournament, where the Eagles are joined by
traditional powers Indiana, Kansas and Duke.  Florida Gulf Coast, the 15th of 16 seeded teams in the
South region, followed its opening-game upset of No. 2
Georgetown University by beating No. 7 San Diego State 81-71
yesterday in Philadelphia.  Six other schools won NCAA tournament games as a No. 15
regional seed since the field was expanded in 1985. Five of the
six had lost their second game by at least 11 points, with
Coppin State in 1997 coming the closest to reaching the final 16
with an 82-81 second-round loss against Texas.  “Our goal was to make history and we did it,”  Florida
Gulf Coast coach Andy Enfield said in a televised interview.
“I’m so proud of these fellas.”  The University of Kansas and Indiana University rallied for
wins that sent them into the final 16 yesterday, one day after
fellow No. 1 regional seed Gonzaga was ousted.  Kansas, the top seed in the South region, erased a nine-
point halftime deficit against No. 8 North Carolina and pulled
away for a 70-58 victory in Kansas City, Missouri.  Indiana, the No. 1 team in the East, rallied past ninth-
seeded Temple University 58-52 by closing the game with a 10-0
scoring run in Dayton, Ohio.  Duke Advances  Duke University, the No. 2 seed in the Midwest, joined
Louisville, Oregon and Michigan State in the regional semifinals
by beating No. 7 Creighton 66-50 last night. It will be the 21st
trip to the NCAA tournament’s final 16 for Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, whose Blue Devils play Michigan State.  Ohio State, the second seed in the West, advanced to the
round of 16 by beating 10th-seeded Iowa State 78-75 on Aaron
Craft’s last-second 3-pointer. The Buckeyes move on to the West
regional semifinals with Wichita State, Arizona and La Salle,
which advanced as a 13th seed yesterday by beating the
University of Mississippi 76-74.  Florida, seeded third in the South, defeated No. 11
Minnesota 78-64 and next faces Florida Gulf Coast, a school of
13,000 students in Fort Myers that held its first class in 1997
and started playing at college basketball’s top level in 2007.  “We tried to scrimmage them in the preseason, so now we
get our shot,” Enfield said.  Record-Setting  Florida Gulf Coast was led by 23 points from Bernard
Thompson, while Sherwood Brown had 17 points and eight rebounds.
The lowest-ranked teams to reach the final 16 of the NCAA
tournament had been a pair of No. 14 seeds -- Cleveland State in
1986 and Chattanooga in 1997.  Miami, the second seed in the East, made it three Florida
schools in the round of 16 with a 63-59 victory over Illinois.
The Hurricanes will next face No. 3 Marquette in the East
semifinals, while Indiana meets No. 4 Syracuse in the other game
in Washington on March 28.  Kansas (31-5) recovered from a first half in which it was
held to 21 points while turning the ball over 12 times and
making 25 percent of its shot attempts.  Kansas went on a 22-6 surge after halftime, sparked by 10
points from Travis Releford, who finished with a game-high 22
points. Jeff Withey added 16 points, 16 rebounds and five
blocked shots for the Jayhawks, who outscored North Carolina
(25-11) 49-28 during the second half.  Kansas will next face fourth-seeded Michigan, which beat
Virginia Commonwealth by 25 points two days ago, on March 29 in
Arlington, Texas.  Indiana Rallies  Indiana (29-6) trailed 52-48 with three minutes, nine
seconds left before holding Temple scoreless the rest of the
way. Victor Oladipo, who led Indiana with 16 points, made a free
throw with 1:19 left to give the Hoosiers their first lead of
the second half and then hit a 3-pointer with 15 seconds left
for a four-point advantage.  “This was a hard-earned victory that can only make us
better,” Indiana coach Tom Crean said.  Gonzaga two days ago became the first No. 1 seed ousted
with a 76-70 loss to ninth-seeded Wichita State in the West
regional. Wichita State next faces No. 12 La Salle on March 28
in Los Angeles, while Ohio State meets No. 6 Arizona.  Ohio State yesterday avoided becoming the latest upset in
the West, which had third-seeded New Mexico, No. 4 Kansas State
and No. 5 Wisconsin exit during the first full round of play
before Gonzaga was beaten by Wichita State.  Craft’s 3-pointer with half a second left pushed the
Buckeyes’ winning streak to 10 games and sent them into the
tournament’s final 16 for a school-record fourth straight year.  Florida (28-7) outscored Minnesota 48-27 in the first half
to advance to the NCAA tournament’s final 16 for the third
straight year. They now head to Arlington for a March 29
showdown with FGCU, which is listed as 11 1/2-point underdogs.  “We’re doing something special out here,” said Florida
Gulf Coast’s Brown. “We’ve been told that this is what college
basketball is all about. We’re really blessed and we’re really
happy to be here right now. But we’ve still got a lot more games
to play hopefully.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
