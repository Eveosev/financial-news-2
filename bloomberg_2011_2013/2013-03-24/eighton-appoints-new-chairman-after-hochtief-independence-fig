Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , Australia’s
largest construction company, appointed Bob Humphris as chairman
after his predecessor resigned in a dispute with shareholder
 Hochtief AG (HOT)  over board independence.  Humphris, the former managing director of  Peabody Energy
Corp. (BTU) ’s local unit and a director of  Australian Infrastructure
Fund (AIX)  Ltd., said in a regulatory statement today that his
priority was to appoint independent directors to replace two
others who resigned last week.  Leighton shares fell the most in 10 months and Standard &
Poor’s placed its debt on a negative credit watch March 22 after
former chairman Stephen Johns and two other directors quit,
saying Essen, Germany-based Hochtief, which holds 53 percent of
Leighton’s shares, no longer supported an independent board.  “The board, the major shareholder and management are all
firmly committed to Leighton and are absolutely focused on
managing the business in the best interests of all
stakeholders,” Humphris said in the statement.  The appointment was first announced in an e-mailed
statement from Hochtief yesterday. The German company, which is
itself controlled by  Spain ’s ACS Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA, through a 54 percent stake, said in a statement
attached to today’s announcement that there had been no
breakdown in relations with Leighton.  “Hochtief regards a good working relationship between
management and the board as fundamental to the success of
Leighton’s business,” it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
