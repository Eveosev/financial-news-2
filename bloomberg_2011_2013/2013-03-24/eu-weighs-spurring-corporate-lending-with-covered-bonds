The European Union is weighing
steps to stimulate the market for covered bonds and securitized
debt to boost investment in businesses, which has been choked by
the bloc’s sovereign-debt crisis.  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial services chief, will
publish draft plans today to boost long-term investment, the
agency said in a statement on its website.  “ Europe  is confronted by a range of constraints that
affect its long-term financing capacity,” the European
Commission said. The draft plans will cover “prudential rules,
corporate governance, and financial markets.”  The commission will seek input on how to spur the market
for “high quality” securitizations, according to a draft of
the plans obtained by  Bloomberg News . The EU also wants input on
establishing common rules for covered bonds across the EU, with
the goal that such financing will fill the gap left by
diminished government and bank lending.  Barnier has pledged to bolster lending for businesses and
research projects as austerity takes its toll across the 27-
nation EU. The  European Central Bank  estimates that bank lending
to non-financial companies fell by 2.1 percent between September
2011 and June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
