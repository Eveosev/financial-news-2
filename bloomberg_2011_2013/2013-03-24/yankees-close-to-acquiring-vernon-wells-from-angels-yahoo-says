The Yankees and Los Angeles Angels
are close to completing a trade that would bring outfielder
Vernon Wells to New York,  Yahoo Sports reports , citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  Wells, 34, has said heâ€™ll waive the no-trade clause in his
contract, which has two years and $42 million remaining, and
accept the move, Yahoo said.  Wells lost his job as a starter last year and would join a
Yankees team that will begin the Major League Baseball regular
season with outfielder Curtis Granderson on the disabled list
along with Mark Teixeira, Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter.  Wells is a three-time All-Star who has a career .273
batting average with 259 home runs and 908 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
