China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, posted better-
than-estimated growth in fourth-quarter profit as higher lending
income outweighed an increase in bad loan charges.  Net income rose 16 percent from a year earlier to 35
billion yuan ($5.6 billion), according to Bloomberg calculations
based on full-year figures released yesterday by the Beijing-
based lender. The result exceeded the 34.5 billion-yuan  average
estimate  of 29 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Chinese banks are grappling with rising defaults and
shrinking lending margins after the world’s second-largest
economy  expanded  7.8 percent in 2012, the slowest pace in 13
years, and policy makers accelerated interest-rate deregulation.
The outlook may improve this year as lenders including
 Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. and Bank of  China 
Ltd. vow to lend more to smaller companies and defend
profitability.  “The results affirmed our view that the pessimism over
Chinese banks’ earnings since last September was overplayed,”
said Luo Yi, a Shenzhen-based analyst at China Merchants
Securities. “Bad loans may continue to rise this year as China
lowers its pace of growth, but the increase will be fairly
modest. Margin contraction may also stabilize as banks adjust
their asset mix.”  Although shares of China’s nine Hong Kong-listed banks have
gained 22 percent since mid-September as the U.S. announced a
third round of quantitative easing, they continue to trade near
record-low valuations. China Construction Bank rose 1.6 percent
to HK$6.27 as of 9:31 a.m. in  Hong Kong , valuing it at about six
times its estimated earnings for 2013.  Economic Targets  Li Keqiang , who took over as China’s premier this month,
said 7.5 percent economic growth is needed to meet targets for
2020, which include doubling per-capita income. Li extended  Zhou
Xiaochuan ’s record tenure as central bank governor, a signal the
nation’s new leaders will deepen a shift toward a more market-
driven financial system.  The central bank in June allowed lenders to widen the
discount on the official lending rate to 20 percent and
broadened the limit to 30 percent a month later, picking up the
pace of interest-rate deregulation. Meanwhile, banks are
offering savers a premium of as much as 10 percent over the
benchmark deposit rate as they seek to attract more funds.  Bank loans cost borrowers a weighted average 6.78 percent
in December, down 1.23 percentage points from the beginning of
the year, according to the  central bank . More than 14 percent of
yuan-denominated loans were priced below the benchmark lending
rate in December, compared with 5 percent in January 2012.  New Loans  China Construction Bank extended 1 trillion  yuan  of new
loans in 2012, taking the total to 7.5 trillion yuan, according
to yesterday’s statement. Its net interest margin widened to
2.75 percent from 2.70 percent a year earlier, the statement
showed.  Chinese lenders traded on the Hong Kong exchange may report
average profit growth of 17 percent in 2012, Victor Wang and
Grace Dai, Hong Kong-based analysts at Macquarie Capital
Securities Ltd., wrote in a March 13 note. China Construction
Bank is their least preferred large lender because it’s the
“most exposed to disintermediation risk” as Chinese companies
turn to non-bank financing, such as bond sales.  Construction Bank plans to raise as much as 60 billion yuan
to replenish Tier-1 or Tier-2 capital by selling “writedown
type” securities, with a maturity of at least five years, by
the end of 2015, it said in a separate statement late yesterday.  The lender’s total capital adequacy ratio stood at 14.32
percent as of Dec. 31, compared with 13.87 percent in September.  Borrowing Curbs  Fourth-quarter profit at China Construction Bank was
derived by subtracting nine-month profit from 2012 earnings
reported yesterday. The company posted a 14 percent increase in
net income last year to 193.2 billion yuan, according to the
statement.  Curbs on borrowing by local governments and efforts to cool
the  property market  are also weighing on asset quality at
Chinese lenders. Their  non-performing loans  have increased for
five straight quarters, the longest deterioration streak since
the data became available in 2004.  Bad loans at China Construction Bank rose 1.67 billion yuan
last quarter to 74.62 billion yuan, accounting for 0.99 percent
of total advances. The lender set aside 40 billion yuan against
soured debt in 2012.  The bank’s net-interest income rose 16 percent to 353.2
billion yuan in 2012, while fee income rose 7.5 percent to 93.5
billion yuan from areas such as credit cards, trade finance and
custodial services.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
