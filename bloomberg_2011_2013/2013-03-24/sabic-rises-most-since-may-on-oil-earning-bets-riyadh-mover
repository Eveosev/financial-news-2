Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s largest petrochemical maker, rose to the highest level
since May after crude oil advanced for a third week in New York,
fueling bets first-quarter results may improve.  Shares of the company known as Sabic rose 2.4 percent to
96.5 riyals, the highest since May 14, at the close in  Riyadh .
The stock was the  biggest advancer  on the benchmark  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX) , which gained 0.6 percent to 7,137.54, the highest
level since Jan. 12. Sabic will probably post first-quarter
results on April 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re approaching the end of the first quarter and there
may be expectations for better results,” said Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad Capital. “Petrochemicals prices are
slightly better.”  Sabic may post a 14 percent increase in 2013 earnings,
according to the mean estimate of 14 analysts on Bloomberg,
after last year’s profit declined 15 percent. Crude oil last
week rose 0.3 percent, to $93.71 a barrel in New York on March
22 in the third week of gains, on signs that Cyprus is moving
closer to a deal to stave off financial collapse and as the  U.S.
economy  improved.  Sabic shares have gained 7.5 percent this quarter compared
with a rally of 11 percent for  Industries Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the Middle
East’s second-largest petrochemicals maker. Sabic has a  12-month
dividend yield  of 5.2 percent, compared with 3.7 percent for  Dow
Chemical Co. (DOW) , the biggest U.S. chemical maker, and a dividend
yield of 3.5 percent for the Tadawul.  Fourteen  analysts  recommend investors buy the shares of
Sabic, while two have a hold rating on the stock, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
