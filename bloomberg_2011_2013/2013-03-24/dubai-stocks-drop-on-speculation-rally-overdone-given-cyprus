Dubai’s shares dropped to the
lowest level in almost a week on speculation a rally this
quarter was overdone as Cyprus struggled to prevent a financial
collapse, stoking concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, decreased 1.1 percent, trimming the surge this year
to 42 percent. Dubai-based phone company Du lost the most since
December. The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 0.6 percent
to 1,897.62, the lowest level since March 18, at the close in
the emirate. The measure has rallied 17 percent in the first
quarter, making it the best performer in the Persian Gulf.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of developing nation stocks
dropped 2.6 percent last week after the European Central Bank
said it may cut off Cyprus banks from emergency funds. Cyprus’
attempt to secure a bailout from Russia was rebuffed. Dubai, one
of seven sheikhdoms that make up the  United Arab Emirates ,
relies on trade, tourism and property for growth.  “There is slight fear, but not a dominant one,” said
Nabil Farhat, partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.
“The general outlook is still positive, however we are seeing a
technical correction and should experience some volatility
during the correction.”  Economic Recovery  Dubai expects the economy to expand more than 4 percent
this year, driven by a tourism boom and a recovering property
market, according to government estimates. The emirate announced
plans in November for a development boasting the world’s biggest
shopping mall and gardens larger than London’s Hyde Park. The
city’s stock market rally in 2013 compares with a decline of 3.8
percent for emerging market stocks.  About 202  million shares  traded in Dubai today that’s more
than the 12-month daily average of 157 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The DFM General Index is valued at
10.6 times estimated 2013 earnings, compared with a multiple of
11.2 for the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index. (BGCC200)   Emaar, the  best-performing stock  on Dubai’s index this
year, fell to 5.33 dirhams, the lowest close since March 5. The
company derived 28 percent of  revenue  from its international
operations in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Du, the company formally known as  Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU)  whose stock has surged 39 percent in
2013, decreased 1.6 percent, the most since Dec. 13, to 4.85
dirhams.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East ,  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI) 
decreased less than 0.1 percent and Bahrain’s  measure  slipped
0.2 percent. Oman’s MSM30 Index climbed 0.6 percent and Kuwait’s
 gauge  increased 0.2 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul All Share
Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.5 percent at 1:52 p.m. in Riyadh. In North
Africa, Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose 0.4 percent.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  advanced 0.3 percent. The yield on the
government’s benchmark 4.25 percent bonds due 2023 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.96 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
