A South African magistrate ordered 26
people to return to court next month to face charges of public
violence after protesters burned local politicians’ homes near
Johannesburg to demand better housing and government services.  The suspects will appear in court on Sept. 27, Busi Menoe,
a police spokeswoman, said by phone today.  “They were arrested because they were engaging in violent
acts by looting tuck-shops and taverns and throwing stones at
police,” Menoe said. The “burning that took place was of three
councillor’s houses and the tavern,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
