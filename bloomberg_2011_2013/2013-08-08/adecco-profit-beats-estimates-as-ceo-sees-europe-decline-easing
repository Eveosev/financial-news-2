Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s largest
provider of temporary workers, reported increased profit and
said it sees more positive signs for business as labor markets
in  Europe  stabilize.  Second-quarter net income rose 12 percent to 126 million
euros ($168 million), beating the 112.1 million-euro estimate of
eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales declined 3 percent
organically to 4.9 billion euros, the Glattbrugg, Switzerland-based company said in a statement today.  “Labour markets are starting to stabilize around Europe
and we see some more positive signs in our business,” Chief
Executive Officer Patrick De Maeseneire said in the statement.
Business in June and July and “is encouraging for the second-half outlook,” he said.  De Maeseneire, the former chief of  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN)  who
became head of Adecco in 2009, has presided over a share-price
rise of about 25 percent this year, as Europe’s job market
decline eased. The euro area probably exited recession in the
three months through June after a record six quarters of
economic contraction.  Revenue declined 12 percent in  France , which generated 25
percent of sales last year, and across Europe rates of decline
eased further, Adecco said.  Adecco and  Randstad Holding NV (RAND)  said July 11 they’re among
temporary-staffing companies that are being probed by French
regulators investigating whether they infringed competition
rules. Adecco is fully cooperating with regulators, the company
reiterated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
