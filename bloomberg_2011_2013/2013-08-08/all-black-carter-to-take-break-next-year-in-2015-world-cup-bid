Dan Carter , rugby union’s highest
scorer in elite Tests, will take a break from the sport next
year in a bid to be fit for the 2015  World Cup .  The 31-year-old, 95-Test All Black will sit out the first
six months of the 2014 season, the New Zealand Rugby Union said
in a statement today. He will miss the majority of next year’s
Super Rugby competition as well as the All Blacks’ Test matches
in June, it said.  “I want to play in the next  Rugby World Cup  in 2015,”
Carter said in the statement. “To do that, it’s important that
I put myself in the best possible position, both physically and
mentally.”  Fly-half Carter, the International Rugby Board’s player of
the year in 2005 and 2012, was invalided out of the 2011 World
Cup with a groin injury that prevented him from taking part in
New Zealand’s tournament victory.  “The extended break will allow Dan to do all the things he
needs to do to give himself a chance to appear at the Rugby
World Cup, and that’s a huge positive for both us and him,”
said All Blacks coach  Steve Hansen .  Carter, who holds the world record for test points with
1,399, has been named in the New Zealand team to play in this
year’s Rugby Championship with Australia,  South Africa  and
Argentina. The All Blacks take on the Wallabies in the first
game of that series in Sydney on Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
