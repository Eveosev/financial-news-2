A whistle-blower alleges that  Sanofi (SAN) 
gave about 1.69 million  yuan  ($276,000) in bribes to 503 doctors
in China, the 21st Century Business Herald  reported .  The whistle-blower, who provided materials to the newspaper
based in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, used the
pseudonym “bacon” and refused to give his identity, according
to today’s report. The bribes were given as “research
spending” in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and
Guangzhou around November 2007, it said.  Clare Xu, Sanofi’s Shanghai-based senior communications
manager, said she couldn’t immediately respond to the report
when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Chinese authorities have taken steps to clean up the
nation’s medical industry and lower health-care costs. The
measures include a police probe of  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  for
allegedly bribing physicians in a bid to boost sales. Sanofi
Chief Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  said on an Aug. 1
conference call that the company was visited by Chinese
authorities on July 29 for unknown purposes.  The  National Development and Reform Commission  also
announced last month that it was starting an investigation of
medicine costs that includes a review of 60 drugmakers.
Separately,  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  was fined 530,000 yuan last week
after a court in Shanghai ruled that its setting of minimum
resale prices constituted monopolistic conduct.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
