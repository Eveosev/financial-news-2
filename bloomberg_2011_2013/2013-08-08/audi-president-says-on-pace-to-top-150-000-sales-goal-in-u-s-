Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi is on pace to
sell more than its stated goal of 150,000 cars and sport-utility
vehicles in the U.S. this year and will get a boost from diesel
models reaching dealerships this month, a brand executive said.  U.S. sales of VW’s premium brand rose 14 percent to 87,341
through July after increasing 19 percent to a record 139,310 for
the entire year in 2012.  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz leads the
segment with 165,598 U.S. sales through July, increasing 12
percent from the same months a year earlier. Globally, Mercedes
trails  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand and Audi.  “The brand is continuing to get stronger and stronger,”
Scott Keogh, president of Audi of America, said in an interview
after a presentation today at the Center for Automotive
Research’s annual  Management Briefing Seminars  near Traverse
City,  Michigan .  This year’s gains are being helped by Q5 SUV sales, which
rose 37 percent through July to 21,486.  Audi is introducing a diesel-powered version of the Q5 this
month in the U.S. along with diesel versions of the A6 and A7.
An A8 sedan with a diesel engine came out earlier this year.  “That’s certainly going to continue to contribute to the
growth,” Keogh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
