European  stocks  advanced as an
increase in Chinese exports outweighed investor concerns the
Federal Reserve will pare bond purchases this year.  BHP Billiton Ltd. rose 3 percent as European commodity
producers climbed.  Deutsche Telekom (DTE)  AG rose the most in more
than two years after second-quarter sales beat forecasts.
Commerzbank AG surged 16 percent after profit in the second
quarter exceeded estimates. Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA
slid 2.4 percent after reporting a worse-than-forecast second-quarter loss.  Nestle (NESN)  SA fell 2.1 percent after posting the
slowest first-half sales growth in four years.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.5 percent to 304.17 at
the close of trading. The benchmark has rallied 10 percent since
June 24 as the Fed, European Central Bank and the Bank of
England pledged to continue stimulus.  “The Chinese trade figures were today’s macro highlight,”
Witold Bahrke, a Copenhagen-based senior strategist at PFA
Pension A/S, which manages about $55 billion, wrote in an e
mail. “Although suspiciously strong, they still offer
temporarily relief from the hard-landing fears out there.”  China ’s exports and imports rebounded in July more than
estimated. Exports rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, the
General Administration of Customs said in Beijing today. That
compared with the median estimate for a 2 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey and June’s 3.1 percent drop. Imports rose
10.9 percent.  “Even if there’s no sign of the much needed rebalancing in
Chinese growth and the economy definitely is slowing, it has
still enough vigor to support the global trade motor, which
particularly is a positive for European companies,” said
Bahrke.  Pianalto Comments  Fed Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto said
yesterday there has been “meaningful improvement” in the labor
market and that tapering may be warranted if it continues to
strengthen. Fed policy makers are weighing data to determine
whether the economy has improved enough to begin reducing their
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  The fewest workers since before the last recession  applied 
for U.S. unemployment benefits over the past month. The number
of claims in the four weeks ended Aug. 3 declined to 335,500  on
average , the least since November 2007, a Labor Department
report showed today in  Washington . They rose to 333,000 last
week, in line with the  median  forecast of 50 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, from 328,000 the prior week.  National benchmark indexes gained in 17 of the 18 western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 advanced 0.3 percent,
Germany’s DAX Index added 0.7 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 rose
0.6 percent.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of European commodity producers advanced the most
of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. BHP Billiton, the
world’s biggest mining company, surged 3 percent to 1,899 pence.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO)  gained 2.1 percent to 3,016.5 pence after
increasing its dividend by 15 percent to 83.5 cents a share. The
world’s second-largest mining company also said first-half
profit dropped 18 percent as slowing economic growth in China
sapped demand for raw materials, dragging down prices.  Polymetal International Plc, a gold and silver producer,
added 6.2 percent to 693 pence and Antofagasta Plc climbed 3.8
percent to 876.5 pence.  Deutsche Telekom rose 7.7 percent to 9.75 euros, its
biggest gain since March 2011.  Germany ’s largest telephone
company said revenue climbed 5.4 percent to 15.2 billion euros
($20.3 billion), beating analyst estimates of 14.6 billion
euros. Net income increased 10 percent to 530 million euros from
a year earlier.  Commerzbank Jumps  Commerzbank soared 16 percent to 7.66 euros, its biggest
gain since October 2011. Germany’s second-largest bank reported
second-quarter net income of 43 million euros, compared with 270
million euros in the second quarter of last year, beating the
4.6 million-euro average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  SBM Offshore NV (SBMO)  surged 8.3 percent to 15.40 euros. The
world’s biggest supplier of floating oil-production platforms
raised its full-year sales forecast to $4.3 billion from $4
billion.  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  added 10 percent to 53.20 euros after the
owner of the Food Lion supermarket chain raised its forecast for
adjusted earnings before interest and taxes in 2013 to at least
780 million euros from 775 million euros.  Adecco SA (ADEN)  rose 3.7 percent to 62.40 Swiss francs after the
world’s largest provider of temporary workers reported increased
profit and said it sees positive signs for business as labor
markets in Europe stabilize. Second-quarter net income rose 12
percent to 126 million euros, beating the 112.1 million-euro
estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Monte Paschi  Monte Paschi fell 2.4 percent to 20.3 euro cents after
reporting a fifth straight quarterly loss. The net loss at the
world’s oldest bank narrowed to 279.3 million euros from 1.64
billion euros a year earlier, when  Monte Paschi (BMPS)  wrote down
goodwill and intangible assets by more than 1.5 billion euros.
This year’s result was wider than the average estimate for a
149.7 million-euro loss of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, declined 2.1
percent to 63.30 francs. Sales increased 4.1 percent, excluding
acquisitions, divestments and currency shifts, the Vevey,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. The median
of 14 analysts’ estimates was for 4.5 percent growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
