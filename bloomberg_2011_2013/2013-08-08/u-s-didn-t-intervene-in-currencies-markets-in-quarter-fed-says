The U.S. didn’t buy or sell dollars
to affect foreign-exchange rates in the second quarter, the
Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  said in a report to Congress.  The value of the Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund
fell to $23.449 billion at the end of June, from $23.719 billion
in the prior quarter, today’s report said. The fund comprises
yen and euro holdings.  The Fed’s System Open Market Account holdings of foreign-currency-denominated assets decreased to $23.471 billion in the
quarter, from $23.741 billion on March 31.  The New York Fed, which acts for the U.S. Treasury and the
Fed in the $4 trillion daily  currency market , intervened in the
currency market in 2011 for the first time since 2000. The Fed
bought $1 billion of the U.S. currency on March 18, 2011, when
Group of Seven nations sought to halt the surge in the yen after
 Japan  was struck by the nation’s worst earthquake on record.  The central bank’s nominal trade-weighted measure of the
 U.S. dollar  increased 1.7 percent during the quarter, reaching
its highest level since July 2010. The greenback depreciated 1.5
percent against the euro and gained 5.2 percent against the yen,
the report said.  Price Swings  There was greater volatility across asset classes in the
second quarter, resulting in deterioration in liquidity
conditions, the report said. Emerging-market currencies were
reportedly the most affected. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility
Index  increased  2.1 percent during the three-month period,
peaking at 11.96 percent in June, the highest level since in
more than a year.  At the end of June, the Exchange Stabilization’s Fund’s
direct holdings of foreign  government securities  totaled $21.73
billion.  At the end of the quarter, the Fed had $1.679 billion
outstanding in reciprocal currency arrangements, all through the
dollar swap line with the  European Central Bank .  The swap lines were provided by the Fed, also with central
banks of Japan, Switzerland, Canada, Mexico and the U.K., as
part of measures taken since 2007 to combat the effects of the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The emergency
liquidity tool, which provides dollars as needed, was
reintroduced in May 2010 in response to renewed demand by
overseas banks for dollar-based funding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
