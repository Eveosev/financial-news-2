Standard Life Plc (SL/) ,  Scotland ’s biggest
insurer, said first-half pretax operating profit jumped 6
percent as third party net inflows surged.  Pretax profit increased to 304 million pounds ($472
million) from a year ago, the Edinburgh-based company said in a
statement today. Third party net inflows at the investment unit
surged to 7.1 billion pounds from 600 million pounds a year ago,
while group assets under administration rose to 232.8 billion
pounds from 218.1 billion pounds at the end of 2012.  “I’m very optimistic about the markets we operate in,”
Chief Executive Officer David Nish said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s  Mark Barton  today. “We’ve invested to
give us the potential to grow as markets change.”  Standard Life Investments’ third-party assets under
management jumped to 93.4 billion pounds from 83 billion pounds
at the end of December, according to the statement. The interim
dividend was raised by 6.5 percent to 5.22 pence a share.  European embedded value operating capital and cash
generation was 231 million pounds in the first half, down from
279 million pounds a year ago, reflecting “a lower back book
management contribution in the period,” the company said.
Embedded value is a measure insurers use to estimate the value
of future payments from policy holders.  The  shares  dropped 1.9 percent to 380.1 pence at 8:07 a.m.
in  London . They have increased 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
