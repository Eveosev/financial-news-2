The U.K. markets regulator fined a
compliance officer and a broker a total of about 116,000 pounds
($180,000) for enabling Rameshkumar Goenka, a Dubai-based
investor, to commit market abuse in 2010.  The Financial Conduct Authority fined  David Davis , a
compliance officer at Paul E. Schweder Miller & Co., 70,258
pounds, and Vandana Parikh, a broker at the same firm, 45,673
pounds, for not acting with enough care and diligence, the
regulator said in a statement today. Tariq Carrimjee, an
 investment adviser  at Somerset Asset Management LLP, was also
fined 89,004 pounds for assisting Goenka.  Goenka was fined $9.6 million in 2011 for manipulating
securities prices on the  London Stock Exchange (LSE) , the largest-ever
penalty imposed on an individual by the regulator, then known as
the Financial Services Authority.  Carrimjee, who the regulator says participated in
discussions about Goenka’s trading and helped him arrange it, is
appealing the FCA’s decision at a financial court in  London .  “The collective failure of Parikh and Davis to recognize
the warning signs and react accordingly meant they unwittingly
enabled his manipulation to take place,” Tracey McDermott,
director of enforcement and financial crime for the FCA, said in
an e-mailed statement.  Davis received the regulator’s standard 30 percent discount
for settling early. He declined to comment on the fine when
reached by phone today. Carrimjee and Parikh didn’t immediately
respond to voicemails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
