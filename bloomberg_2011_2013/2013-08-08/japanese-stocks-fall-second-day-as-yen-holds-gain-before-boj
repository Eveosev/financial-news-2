Japanese  stocks  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index heading for a second straight daily drop, as the yen
traded near a seven-week high versus the dollar before the
central bank concludes a policy meeting.  The Topix dropped 0.5 percent to 1,149.44 as of 9:03 a.m.
in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 0.2 percent to
13,798.56 after yesterday capping its biggest fall since June
13.  The Bank of Japan will maintain its asset-purchasing
program at a two-day meeting that finishes today, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The Topix rose 34 percent this
year as of yesterday, the biggest gain among developed markets,
amid optimism that the BOJ’s stimulus and Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe’s reforms will boost growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
