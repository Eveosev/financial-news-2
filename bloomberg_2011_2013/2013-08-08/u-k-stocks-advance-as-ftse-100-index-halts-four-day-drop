U.K. stocks  rose, rebounding from
their biggest decline in more than six weeks, as mining
companies gained after a report showed Chinese trade improved.  Commodity producers contributed the most to the  FTSE 100 (UKX) 
Index’s advance after a report showed China’s imports and
exports rebounded more than economists had predicted.  Aviva Plc (AV/) 
jumped 5.4 percent after posting first-half operating profit
that beat analysts’ estimates and saying that restructuring
costs fell 10 percent.  AMEC Plc (AMEC)  lost 2.3 percent after
forecasting that sales may fail to increase this year.  The FTSE 100 gained 12.18 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,523.39 at 9:10 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark has
 rallied 8.2 percent  from a low on June 24 as the  Federal Reserve 
said it remains flexible on the pace of bond buying. The broader
FTSE All-Share Index also added 0.2 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.1 percent today.  The number of shares trading hands on FTSE 100-listed
companies was 2.4 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  In China, a report from the General Administration of
Customs showed that  exports  rose 5.1 percent last month from a
year earlier, more than the 2 percent increase forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Exports dropped 3.1 percent in June.
Imports rose 10.9 percent in July.  Schroders Plc (SDR)  tumbled 5.5 percent after saying that clients
withdrew 1.1 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) from the U.K.’s
biggest fund manager in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
