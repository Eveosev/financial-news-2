Asian  stocks  outside Japan rose after
Chinese exports grew more than forecast. Japanese shares sank as
the yen strengthened after the  Bank of Japan  maintained its
stimulus policy.  BHP Billiton  Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining firm, gained
1.2 percent in Sydney. Kubota Corp. climbed 1.6 percent after
profit at the Japanese tractor maker surged 50 percent, topping
analyst forecasts.  Telstra Corp. (TLS)  gained 2.4 percent as
Australia’s largest phone company posted earnings that beat
analyst estimates after luring subscribers to its wireless
services.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  gained 0.8
percent to 438.29 as of 2:41 p.m. in Hong Kong, with nine of the
10 industry groups on the gauge advancing. Three shares rose for
every two that declined.  “We are constructive on Asian equities,” Ronald Chan, a
 fund manager  at Manulife Asset Management in  Hong Kong , which
oversees about $248 billion, told Bloomberg TV. China’s
government “is putting a floor at 7 percent growth and it’s
likely to end the year at 7.5 percent. That gives investors a
little bit more confidence in the market.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, that includes Japan, fell 7.6
percent through yesterday from a five-year high on May 20 amid
concern a slowdown in Chinese growth will worsen and as the
 Federal Reserve  weighed a reduction in stimulus. The gauge
gained 3.1 percent this year, compared with a 19 percent surge
on the S&P 500. It rose 0.1 percent today.  That left the Asia-Pacific measure trading at 13 times
estimated earnings compared with 15.3 for the  S&P 500  Index and
13.8 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  China Exports  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.3 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite slid 0.3 percent. China’s overseas shipments
gained 5.1 percent in July from a year earlier, topping
forecasts for a 2 percent increase. They fell 3.1 percent in
June.  China, the world’s second-largest economy, expanded 7.5
percent in the second quarter after growing 7.7 percent in the
previous three months.  Raw-materials shares posted the largest gains on the MSCI
Asia Pacific excluding Japan index. BHP Billiton climbed 1.2
percent to A$35.31 and Rio Tinto, the second-largest mining
company, added 1.5 percent to A$59.48 in Sydney. Jiangxi Copper
Co.,  China ’s biggest producer of the industrial commodity, rose
2.1 percent to HK$13.46 in Hong Kong.  Regional Gauges  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 1.1 percent, maintaining
gains after a report showed the country’s unemployment rate
remained at 5.7 percent in July.  South  Korea ’s  Kospi index  added 0.3 percent as the  Bank of
Korea  left its benchmark  interest rate  at 2.5 percent, as
predicted by all economists surveyed by Bloomberg. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index lost 0.2 percent. Markets in Singapore, Indonesia
and Malaysia are closed for holidays.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.2 percent
today after the gauge fell yesterday for a third day. Fed Bank
of Cleveland President  Sandra Pianalto  became the fourth U.S.
central bank official this week to signal reductions in asset
purchases may be warranted should the job market continue to
strengthen.  Fed policy makers are weighing data to determine whether
the  U.S. economy  has improved enough to begin reducing its $85
billion in monthly bond purchases. Pianalto said yesterday there
has been “meaningful improvement” in the labor market and that
tapering may be warranted if it continues to strengthen.  Yen Rises  Japan’s  Topix index  fell 1.4 percent and the Nikkei 225
Stock Average dropped 1.6 percent, with both gauges reversing
earlier gains. The BOJ kept policy unchanged, matching forecasts
of economist surveyed by Bloomberg. Most analysts expect more
stimulus in the next 10 months as central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda and his colleagues seek to achieve 2 percent inflation.  The yen rose 0.1 percent to 96.21 per dollar at 3:30 p.m.
in  Tokyo , a fifth day of gains.  Even after falling for the past three months,  Japan ’s Topix
index is still up 33 percent this year, retaining Japan’s
position as the world’s best-performing developed equity market.
The measure has risen amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will push through reforms while the BOJ provides record
stimulus.  Kubota advanced 1.6 percent to 1,427 yen in Tokyo after
reporting operating profit climbed 50 percent in the first
quarter to 47.1 billion yen ($490 million). That beat the 33.8
billion yen average forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Telstra advanced 2.4 percent to A$5.13 in Sydney. Net
income rose 12 percent to A$3.8 billion ($3.4 billion) in the 12
months ended June 30 from A$3.41 billion a year. That topped the
A$3.7 billion average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chong Hing Bank Ltd., Hong Kong’s smallest family-run
lender, soared 18 percent to a record HK$26.45 after potential
buyers approached the bank and its parent company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
