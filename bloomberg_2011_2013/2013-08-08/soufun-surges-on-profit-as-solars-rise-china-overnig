Chinese stocks advanced the most in a
week in New York as companies from  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  to  China 
Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. reported better-than-estimated earnings.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. climbed 2.1 percent to 94.13
yesterday. SouFun, China’s biggest real estate information
website, jumped 13 percent to a record and Xinyuan Real Estate
Co. gained the most in two weeks.  Yingli Green Energy Holding
Co. (YGE)  and  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  rallied after saying second-quarter
shipments beat their estimates. China Unicom traded at the
widest  premium  in three months over the Hong Kong stock.  Fifteen out of sixteen companies on the China-US gauge that
have reported earnings since July 22 posted profit that beat
analysts’  projections , compared with nine out of 14 firms in the
same period a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Real estate companies SouFun and Xinyuan both raised their 2013
sales forecasts yesterday, while China Unicom, the nation’s
second-largest wireless carrier, posted second-quarter profit
that surpassed analysts’ estimates.  “Most of the outlooks of the companies are pretty
positive,” Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset
Management Inc., which manages $700 million of assets, said by
phone from Lisle,  Illinois . “Most of these companies have such
niches that they kind dominate in the industries they are in.
They look pretty healthy for the third quarter.”  ETF Climbs  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., added 1.8 percent to $34.40,
rallying the most in a week. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
climbed 0.4 percent as data on China’s trade and U.S. jobless
claims bolstered optimism in the global economy.  China’s exports and imports rebounded by more than forecast
last month, with overseas sales rising 5.1 percent from a year
earlier and imports gaining 10.9 percent, government data showed
yesterday. The statistics bureau will today provide figures on
July’s inflation, industrial production and retail sales and
January-July fixed-asset investment.  SouFun’s American depositary receipts jumped to $39.49, the
highest level since its U.S. listing in September 2010.  The Beijing-based company said net income in the second
quarter jumped 67.5 percent to $55.4 million in a statement
yesterday, while sales grew 48.6 percent to $144.1 million. Both
exceeded the mean projections of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  SouFun raised its 2013 revenue forecast to as much as $548
million, from $538 million previously. SouFun’s estimate beat
the average forecast of $541 million of four analysts.  Price Targets  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. yesterday increased the price
target for SouFun to $31.5 from $29, reiterating a neutral
rating. Deutsche Bank AG lifted its price goal to $42 from $32,
while keeping a buy rating on the stock.  Xinyuan, also based in Beijing, gained 2.4 percent to $5.11
in  New York . The developer lifted its 2013  sales projection  by 6
percent to over $880 million. Xinyuan’s second-quarter earnings
also beat its own guidance in May by 58 percent, it said.  China Unicom’s ADRs advanced 6.7 percent to a six-month
high of $15.36. The ADRs, each representing 10 underlying shares
in the telecom company, traded 3.2 percent above Hong Kong
shares, the biggest premium since April 19.  China Unicom’s net income rose 41 percent and sales
expanded 22 percent in the three months through June from a year
earlier. Both earnings and revenue beat analysts’ average
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Hong Kong-based company has
turned to low-cost smartphones from Chinese suppliers like
Lenovo Group Ltd.’s A66 or ZTE Corp.’s V790, both priced at 499
 yuan  ($82) to trim subsidy costs and reduce reliance on Apple
Inc.’s iPhone to win users.  Solar Shipments  Yingli, the biggest solar-panel maker, surged 6.3 percent
to $3.87, the biggest rally in three weeks. The Baoding, China-based company estimated shipments of solar modules to rise as
much as 24 percent last quarter from the January-March period,
compared with a previous forecast of a “low-to-mid teen
percent” increase, it said in a statement yesterday.  Trina soared 9.4 percent to $7.22, the biggest jump since
July 15. The company said second-quarter shipments may surpass
its previous estimate by more than 20 percent to as much as 660
megawatts of modules in a release yesterday.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong climbed
0.4 percent yesterday to 9,484.64, after slumping the most in a
month the previous day, while the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
slipped 0.1 percent to 2,044.9 in a second day of declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
