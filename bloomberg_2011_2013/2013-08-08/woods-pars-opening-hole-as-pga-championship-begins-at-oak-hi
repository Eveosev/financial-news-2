Jason Day,  Lee Westwood  and Scott Piercy have moved into a share of the lead at golf’s PGA
Championship, tying Adam Scott and  Jim Furyk  at 5-under par.  Day, an Australian who had top-three finishes at the
Masters and U.S. Open this year, birdied two of his first three
holes at Oak Hill Country Club outside Rochester, New York.  Westwood, an Englishman whose 62 major-championship starts
are the most of any active player without a Grand Slam title, is
1-under through three holes today to get to 5-under for the
tournament. Piercy birdied three straight holes early in his
round to move into a tie for the lead.  Scott has just started his second round as a steady rain
falls at the season’s final major championship. Furyk tees off
later today.  David Hearn of Canada is at 4-under, one stroke ahead of
England’s Paul Casey,  Robert Garrigus  and Matt Kuchar of the
U.S., and Marcus Fraser of Australia.  Four-time PGA champion Tiger Woods and British Open winner
 Phil Mickelson  are both six strokes back after shooting 1-over-par 71s during yesterday’s first round. Woods and Mickelson were
under par before double bogeys on their final holes. Mickelson
has just started his second round, while Woods tees off later.  There were 35 first-round scores below par at Oak Hill
yesterday. The last time the club hosted the PGA Championship,
in 2003, 12 players shot scores lower than par during the
opening round.  To contact the reporters on this story:
