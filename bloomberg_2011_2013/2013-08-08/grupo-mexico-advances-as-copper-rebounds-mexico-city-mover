Grupo  Mexico  SAB, Mexico’s largest
mining company, rose the most on the country’s benchmark index
as copper prices advanced to an eight-week high.  Grupo Mexico rose 2.5 percent to 41.10 pesos at 12:16 p.m.
in Mexico City, the biggest increase on a closing basis since
Aug. 1. The benchmark IPC  index  advanced 0.8 percent.  Copper futures climbed to an eight-week high in  New York 
today after imports rose to the highest in 14 months in China,
the world’s top metals user. Copper slumped the first seven
months of the year amid concern that China’s efforts to keep its
economy from overheating would curb metals demand.  “All year we have seen very low copper prices,” Julio Cesar Martinez, an analyst at Punto Casa De Bolsa in Mexico
City, said in a telephone interview.  Grupo Mexico  is poised to
benefit from rising Chinese demand because it has a “very
efficient cost structure compared with the most important peers
in the global industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
