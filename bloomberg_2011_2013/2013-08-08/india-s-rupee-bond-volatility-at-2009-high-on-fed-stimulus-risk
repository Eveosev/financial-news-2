Historical volatility on  India ’s
rupee and bonds rose to 2009 highs this week on concern the U.S.
will pare stimulus, intensifying debt outflows and leaving the
currency vulnerable to a current-account deficit.  The rupee fell to a record low of 61.8050 per dollar on Aug.
6 as Federal Reserve officials signaled that cuts to asset
purchases are possible in September as the U.S. economic outlook
improves.  Raghuram Rajan , who will take charge of India’s
central bank when Governor Duvvuri Subbarao’s term ends next
month, said on Aug. 6 that more steps will be taken soon to
stabilize the rupee.  “Supplies of the dollar are constrained,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of currencies and money markets at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  in
Mumbai. “The rupee is under pressure due to foreign-investor
outflows and demand for dollars from oil importers.”  The rupee’s three-month historical volatility rose one
basis point to 11.92 percent, the highest level since February
2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Fifty-day historical
volatility for the 10-year benchmark sovereign bond touched 22
percent yesterday, the most since June 2009. Indian markets are
shut tomorrow for a public holiday.  The rupee rebounded today on speculation the RBI sold
dollars, according to two traders with knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be named as the information isn’t public.  The currency climbed 0.2 percent to 61.1750 per dollar as
of 10:02 a.m. in Mumbai, after plunging 0.8 percent yesterday,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.76 percent today.  Yields Climb  Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $9.5
billion since May 22, when Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first
signaled a potential tapering. India’s current-account deficit
widened to an unprecedented 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product in the year ended March 31, official data show.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
rose two basis points to 8.16 percent, according to prices from
the central bank’s trading system. The yield has dropped 13
basis points this week.  Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans , among the
strongest proponents of the monetary accommodation in the U.S.,
said Aug. 6 that he “would clearly not” rule out a decision to
begin curbing asset purchases in September. Dallas Fed President
 Richard Fisher  said Aug. 5 the central bank is closer to slowing
$85 billion in monthly bond buying and warned investors not to
rely on that stimulus.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.1 percent to
62.66 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were little changed at 62.74. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
