Chase Utley  signed a two-year
contract extension with the  Philadelphia Phillies  that,
including options, could keep the second baseman with the club
through the 2018 season.  Utley, 34, whose contract was set to expire at the end of
this season, agreed to a deal that has three years of vesting or
club options, the team said today in a news release. Financial
terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed.  The contract could be worth as much as $75 million,
according to FoxSports.com. Utley will receive $27 million over
the next two seasons and have vesting options for the following
campaigns if he reaches 500 plate appearances each season from
2015-17, the  website said , citing unidentified people in  Major
League Baseball .  “As we’ve said before, we see Chase as a true Phillie for
life,” Phillies General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. said in a
statement. “This contract moves us toward that end.”  Utley entered today’s game against the Chicago Cubs batting
.277 with 15 home runs and 43 runs batted in this season,
ranking first among National League second basemen with a .505
slugging percentage. He’s had 344 plate appearances, playing in
84 of the team’s 113 games after missing a month with a strained
oblique muscle.  Having battled chronic knee issues, the last time Utley had
at least 500 plate appearances in a season was 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
