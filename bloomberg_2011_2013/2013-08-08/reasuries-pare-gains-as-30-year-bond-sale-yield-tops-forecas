Treasuries rose, pushing 30-year bond
yields to a one-week low, as a $16 billion auction of the
securities drew above-average demand from an investor class that
includes foreign central banks.
       U.S. benchmark  10-year notes advanced for a second day as
the third and final coupon security sale this week found demand
with auction yields at almost the highest level in two years.
Treasuries briefly pared gains after Federal Reserve Bank of
Dallas President Richard Fisher told  Germany ’s business paper
Handelsblatt in an interview that the Fed should start reducing
bond purchases in September if “economic data doesn’t
significantly deteriorate.”  The central banker “said ’if economic data allows,’ so in
the back of people’s minds, there still is a chance they may not
taper in September,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “It’s why the auctions
went pretty well.”  The yield on 30-year bonds  fell  one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.67 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.875 percent
security due May 2043 added 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face
amount, to 85 20/32. The yield declined as much as five basis
points.  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell one basis point to
2.59 percent, after touching the lowest level since July 31.  Auction Detail  The bonds sold today drew a yield of 3.652 percent,
compared with a forecast of 3.631 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. That compared
with 3.66 percent at a previous auction of similar-maturity debt
on July 11, which was the highest in almost two years.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.11, the
least since August 2011 and compared with an average of 2.55 for
the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 37.2 percent for the past 10 sales. Primary
dealers purchased 42.7 percent at the auction, below the 48.5
percent average of the past 10 auctions.  Direct Bidding  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.1 percent of
the securities at the sale, compared with an average of 14.3
percent for the past 10 auctions.  “The street picked up 42.7 percent; from that perspective,
it’s a good auction,” said Ray Remy, head of fixed income in
New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc.  Investors have bid $2.90 for each dollar of the $1.329
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 11.9 percent this year,
compared with a decline of 2.7 percent by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 2.5 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2
percent.  This week’s Treasury note and bond auctions totaled $72
billion. The government sold $32 billion in three-year debt Aug.
6 and $24 billion in 10-year securities yesterday. The sales
will raise $2.4 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held
by the public total $69.6 billion, according to the U.S.
Treasury.  Asset Allocation  Bond managers must adapt to a “new world” of near zero-round interest rates and the likelihood of lower total returns,
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  wrote in his
monthly investment outlook.  Reducing maturity isn’t the only potential strategy to win
this new war, Gross wrote in his outlook, adding that investors
should focus on “carry,” a strategy that involves capitalizing
on yield-curve differences, volatility, credit spreads, maturity
extension and currency variations.  Another investor concluded that investors should sell bonds
as the 30-year bull-run in fixed-income securities is drawing to
an end.  “We believe that this is a generational selling
opportunity for investors in the 20-year Treasury and other long
duration bonds,” James O’Shaughnessy, chief executive officer
of O’Shaughnessy Asset Management in  Stamford ,  Connecticut ,
wrote in a note to clients. “In my lifetime I will never again
see returns to the long bond as high as those achieved for the
10-, 20-, and 40- years through March 2009.”  Investors should reduce bond maturity durations before it
is too late, he added.  Bond Sales  Institutional investors’ allocations to dollar-denominated
bonds have dropped to the lowest level since 2007 as strategists
at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. see a shift away from
the debt that may fuel higher borrowing costs.  Holdings by investors from pensions to endowments fell to
26.2 percent of assets in the second quarter, from 30.1 percent
in the corresponding period of 2012, according to the Wilshire
Trust Universe Comparison Service, which tracks plans that
oversee $3.46 trillion. Morgan Stanley’s $1.8 trillion  wealth
management unit  has been advising clients to cut bond
allocations to the lowest in more than five years, Chief
Investment Strategist David Darst said.  The  yield  on 10-year Treasuries reached 2.75 percent on
July 8 from a low this year of 1.61 percent on May 1, triggered
by Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, who rattled markets in May and
June by outlining a plan to end the central bank’s unprecedented
asset purchases.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
debt each month to put downward pressure on interest rates. It
purchased $3.22 billion of Treasuries maturing from August 2020
to November 2022 today. Policy makers are discussing whether the
economy has improved enough for them to start reducing the
purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
