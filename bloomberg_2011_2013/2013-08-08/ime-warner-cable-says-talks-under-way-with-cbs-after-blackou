Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  said it’s
talking with  CBS Corp. (CBS) , almost a week after a breakdown in
negotiations led the cable provider to block its customers from
seeing the network.  “Our negotiators are communicating,” Bobby Amirshahi, a
spokesman for New York-based Time Warner Cable, said today in an
e-mail. Dana McClintock, a spokesman for CBS, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  Time Warner Cable stopped broadcasting CBS to more than 3
million viewers in New York, Los Angeles,  Dallas  and other
markets on Aug. 2. The two sides have sparred over the fees that
New York-based CBS charges to retransmit shows over Time Warner
Cable’s system, as well as other issues, such as how content can
be streamed over the Internet.  The parties had a discussion last night, said Martin Franks, a CBS executive vice president, as he answered questions
at a New York City Council  hearing today . The meeting addressed
the effect of the blackout on consumers.  The two companies have largely made their arguments via the
press, with Time Warner Cable Chief Executive Officer Glenn Britt publicly offering to sell CBS’s networks to customers a la
carte -- a system that would let subscribers decide which of the
channels they wanted individually. CBS called the proposal a
“scam.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
