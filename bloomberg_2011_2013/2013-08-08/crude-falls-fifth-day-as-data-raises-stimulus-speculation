West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for a fifth day, capping the longest stretch of declines since
December, as better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims raised
concern that the  Federal Reserve  will trim stimulus measures.  Prices dropped 0.9 percent. About 333,000 American workers
applied for  unemployment benefits  last week, below the 335,000
estimate by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The Fed may begin
curbing bond purchases in September, Fed Bank of  Chicago 
President  Charles Evans  said Aug. 6. U.S. crude output jumped to
the most since 1989 and  gasoline supplies  are at the highest
seasonal level since 1990, government data showed yesterday.  “People are worried about tapering with the good economic
data,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in Chicago. “The market is looking heavy because
the U.S. is producing more and more oil. You have to respect the
fact that fundamentally we are very well supplied.”  WTI for September delivery slid 97 cents to $103.40 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since July 30. The volume of all futures traded was
12 percent above the 100-day average at 3:45 p.m. Prices have
tumbled 4.2 percent since Aug. 1. They last decreased for five
consecutive days in the period ended Dec. 10.  Brent for September settlement retreated 76 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $106.68 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 3.8 percent above the 100-day
average. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI strengthened by
21 cents to $3.28, the widest level since July 30.  Jobless Claims  “Crude is on its way to test $100,” said Jeff Grossman,
president of New York-based BRG Brokerage and a Nymex floor
trader. “The market went up too high. There is nothing to
support it.”  The number of jobless claims in the four weeks ended Aug. 3
declined to 335,500  on average , the lowest level since November
2007, the Labor Department reported. Fed policy makers are
watching the job market to determine when to begin scaling back
the central bank’s $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  Evans, who has been among the most vocal proponents of
record monetary accommodation, said the central bank is likely
to end the bond-buying program in mid-2014. He is a voting
member of the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year and has
consistently supported increased stimulus.  U.S. crude output gained 18,000 barrels a day last week to
7.56 million, the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday. Production has
advanced 8.2 percent this year after a 19 percent gain in 2012.  July Surge  Crude surged 8.8 percent in July, the biggest monthly gain
since August 2012, as U.S. stockpiles slumped and on concern
that political turmoil in  Egypt  may disrupt oil supplies from
the  Middle East . Inventories tumbled 29.9 million barrels in the
four weeks ended July 19, the most for such a period since 1982,
EIA data showed. Stockpiles fell 1.32 million last week.  “We finally passed the point of people worrying about big
draws,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “Crude  oil prices  should not
be up here. The longs are bailing out and the speculation trade
is coming off.”  Hedge funds  and other money managers reduced bullish bets
on WTI by 4.6 percent in the week ended July 30, the first
decline in more than a month, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s July 26 Commitments of Traders report. Net-long positions, or  wagers  that prices will increase, fell to
318,819 futures and options combined from 334,094 the prior
week, the highest level in CFTC data going back to 2006.  Longs ‘Squeezed’  WTI’s decline “is now getting nasty as large speculative
long positions are getting squeezed out,” said  Carsten Fritsch ,
an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , in an e-mail.  Crude also followed drops in gasoline as the cost of
meeting renewable fuel rules sank, easing concern that higher
costs to blend ethanol would curb fuel supply. The 2013
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, dropped to 67 cents
at 3:21 p.m. in New York, the lowest level since April 25, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Gasoline supplies  jumped 135,000 barrels to 223.6 million
last week, the highest level for this time of year in EIA data
going back to 1990.  “The larger problem is the product weakness from a
fundamental point of view,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “There is some excess
length in WTI and there may be long liquidations.”  Gasoline Drops  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.35 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.8576 a gallon, the sixth straight drop.  “The market is off because RINs are getting crushed,”
said Tom Finlon, Jupiter, Florida-based director of Energy
Analytics Group LLC. “RINs are demolishing the price of
gasoline and taking everything else down.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
October was 21.2 percent, up from 20.7 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 627,074
contracts as of 3:45 p.m. It totaled 647,912 contracts
yesterday, 0.7 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was a record 1.89 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
