Swiss unemployment was unchanged at
the highest since 2010 in July, indicating that the economy
remains at risk of being dragged down by the recession in the
neighboring euro area.  The  jobless rate , adjusted for seasonal swings, stayed  at
3.2 percent in July, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs
in Bern said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s in line with
the  median estimate  of 11 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
The unadjusted jobless rate rose to 3 percent from 2.9 percent
in June.  Consumer demand has underpinned the Swiss economy, helping
it to expand 0.6 percent in first quarter, growing faster than
in neighboring  Germany . A cap of 1.20 per euro on the franc, set
by the Swiss National Bank in September 2011, has also helped
Switzerland avoid the slump that has befallen the 17-member euro
area. The currency union’s jobless rate, calculated according to
the International Labor Organization’s definition, held at 12.1
percent in June.  SNB President Thomas Jordan said at the central bank’s most
recent policy review in June that the franc was still strong and
that risks to the Swiss economy due to the sovereign debt crisis
remained high.  In Switzerland, the number of job openings fell by 610 to
14,037 in July, today’s report showed. A total of 181,398 people
were looking for a job, 1,592 more than in the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
