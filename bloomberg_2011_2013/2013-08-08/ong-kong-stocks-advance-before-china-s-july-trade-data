Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index rising the first time in three days ahead of
data today expected to show expansion in China’s exports.  The  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.5 percent to 21,704.65 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong, rebounding from the biggest drop in a
month yesterday. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  increased
0.7 percent to 9,515.66 today. Overseas shipments may have risen
2 percent year-on-year in July after contracting 3.1 percent in
June, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreated 4.7 percent this year through
yesterday, the biggest decline among major markets tracked by
Bloomberg, amid concern China’s growth is slowing and
speculation the Fed will pare bond purchases. The gauge traded
at 10.29 times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with 15.33
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, had fallen as much as 27 percent in June from a
Feb. 1 high, meeting some investors’ definition of a bear
market.  Futures on the  S&P 500  gained 0.2 percent after the
benchmark gauge lost 0.4 percent yesterday, its first three-day
drop since June 12. Fed Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra
Pianalto  said yesterday there has been “meaningful
improvement” in the labor market and that tapering of record
stimulus may be warranted if it continues to strengthen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
