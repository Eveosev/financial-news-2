GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
largest drugmaker, is investing in bioelectronic medicines and
technologies with a new $50 million venture capital fund.  The fund, based in Cambridge,  Massachusetts , will
complement the work of Glaxo’s  bioelectronics research unit 
established last year and will build a portfolio of five to
seven companies over the next five years, Glaxo said in a
 statement  today.  Bioelectronic technology involves miniature devices that
could potentially read, change or generate electrical impulses
along nerves in the body to help treat a wide variety of
diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and diabetes.
The field is in its very early stages, and Glaxo’s ambition is
to have the first bioelectronic medicine ready for approval by
the end of the decade, according to Glaxo.  “We want to create the medicines of the future and be the
catalyst for this work,” said Moncef Slaoui, Glaxo’s chairman
of research and development and architect of the company’s
early-stage investment strategy. “This fund is a key part of
our efforts.”  The fund’s first investment will be in Valencia,
California-based  SetPoint Medical , which is creating implantable
devices to treat inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s Disease. The treatments have
been developed based on a new understanding that the immune
system can be influenced by the nervous system, Glaxo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
