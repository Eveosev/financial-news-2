Hungary’s  stocks  climbed the most in
11 months after better-than-anticipated results from the
country’s biggest telecommunications company and export data
from Germany and  China  helped lift eastern European markets.  The BUX index advanced 2.8 percent, the largest increase
among the 94 major indexes tracked by Bloomberg and the biggest
daily gain since Sept. 14. OTP Bank Nyrt., Richter Gedeon Nyrt.
and Mol Nyrt. all surged at least 2.5 percent.  Budapest-listed companies are gaining as Hungary’s economy
recovers from a second recession since 2009. Magyar Telekom
closed at a three-week high after announcing that second-quarter
net income increased 14 percent and boosting its revenue
forecast for this year.  OTP, the country’s largest lender, climbed 2.5 percent to
4,510 forint. “The share has finally joined regional lenders
that have been rallying in the past sessions,” equity analyst
Attila Gyurcsik at  Hungary ’s largest brokerage, Concorde
Befektetesi Zrt., said by phone.  The bank, which has a 30 percent weight in the gauge, has
dropped 8.9 percent in the past month, the worst showing among
16 leading Eastern European lenders tracked by Bloomberg.  The stock declined as Hungary’s government announced plans
in mid-July to help households with foreign-currency mortgages,
which fueled speculation about potential new costs for lenders.
Negotiations between the banks and the government have started.  Medicine-maker Richter gained 4.3 percent to 3,719 forint,
the most in 22 months, as trading volumes amounted to 334
percent of the stock’s three-month daily average. A growing
number of investors expect Richter to be re-included in MSCI’s
gauge of emerging-market stocks next month, Gyurcsik said.  Oil-company Mol advanced 2.9 percent to 16,600 forint,
reversing a two-day, 4 percent drop caused by concerns over the
future of its Croatian subsidiary INA. Magyar Telekom gained 0.9
percent to 325 forint, the highest close since July 18.  The BUX has increased 3.4 percent this year, compared with
a 10 percent drop in the MSCI  emerging markets  index. German
exports jumped 0.6 percent from May and Chinese shipments
overseas climbed 5.1 percent in July, reports showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
