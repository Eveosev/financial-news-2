New York  has it all when it comes to food and drink. Here are 40 restaurants and bars, from the smart and sophisticated to late-night dives.  Alder: This casual restaurant and bar on Second Avenue is the baby of Wylie Dufresne, known for his innovative food at WD-50. There are quirky cocktails such as the Hey Rube, with Pimm’s, gin and rhubarb in an enamel beaker with cucumber. The cooking is creative. How about fried quail with banana curry, Chinese broccoli and pickled turmeric? It’s accessible and fun. Information: +1-212-539-1900 or  http://aldernyc.com/ .  Balthazar: This buzzing brasserie is so popular with tourists and fans of “Sex and the City,” it’s easy to lose track of how good it is. Restaurateur Keith McNally has created a celebrity hangout with food you want to eat at prices you can afford. It’s democratic glamour. These days you’re more likely to sit next to an out-of-towner than a star. Information: +1-212-965-1414 or  http://www.balthazarny.com/ .  Le Bernardin Lounge: Chef  Eric Ripert ’s midtown restaurant is one of the world’s best. How about the lounge? It is excellent. The snacks -- oysters, ceviche etc. -- are tempting, the room is quiet and sophisticated and the service discreet and assured. This is a great place to start the evening. Information: +1-212-554-1515 or  http://le-bernardin.com/lounge/ .  BLT Steak: This group of American steak houses is popular and it can be difficult to snag a table. I got a seat at the bar at the East 57th Street branch and was pleasantly surprised by the warmth of the welcome. The gruyere popovers are a great way to start a meal and they came out free while I waited for my New York strip. Information: +1-212-752-7470 or  http://www.e2hospitality.com/blt-steak .  Blue Hill at Stone Barns: You need to book well in advance to eat at this restaurant on a farm almost an hour by train from  New York City . You may need to save up, as well. The menus are $148 or $208, with wine pairings at $110 and $150. If you can afford it, it’s worth it. You can explore the farm and then taste Dan Barber’s dishes, which draw on the farm’s produce. Information: +1-914-366-9600 or  http://www.bluehillfarm.com/ .  Charlie Bird: This is the new  West Village  brasserie of chef Ryan Hardy and wine director Robert Bohr, formerly of Babbo and Daniel. The menu is Italian, with a raw bar. It’s a fashionable establishment with beautiful diners enjoying small plates such as fried zucchini flowers with anchovy and ricotta. Expect a crush: It’s scene-and-be-seen. Information: +1-212-235-7133 or  http://www.charliebirdnyc.com/ .  Costata: This is a modern steak house where chef  Michael White  serves pasta dishes and raw seafood alongside the meaty cuts that you might expect. From the abstract art on the walls through to the cocktails, it’s a refreshing change from more traditional restaurants. Costata is smart and can be expensive. If you like somewhere classic, this may not be for you. Information: +1-212-334-3320 or  http://costatanyc.com/ .  Creative Juice : This is the new idea of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur behind  Gramercy Tavern  and Shake Shack. My eyes start to glaze over and then to roll when people tell me about detoxing with juice. Fortunately, the juices and salads taste good. Information:  http://www.creativejuiceflows.com/home.php .  DBGB: This bar and kitchen in the Bowery is a lively place where chef  Daniel Boulud  takes his inspiration from the French brasserie and gives it an American twist. A meal might consist of oysters, a burger and peach tart, with draft beer. The interior is dark and the place can get crowded and loud, so avoid if you want a quiet bite on a Friday night. Information: +1-212-933-5300 or  http://www.dbgb.com/nyc/ .  Eleven Madison Park:  Daniel Humm  won the James Beard award for outstanding chef after taking the top restaurant accolade. I’d go further and argue it is among the best in the world. The standout dish? Carrot tartare with spicy carrot vinaigrette, mustard oil, pickled quail yolk, English pea mustard, toasted sunflower seeds, smoked bluefish, grated horseradish, fresh snap peas, sliced chives, mustard seeds,  Amagansett sea salt  and toasted bread. Information: +1-212-889-0905 or  http://elevenmadisonpark.com/ .  Ellington: This venue on the Upper West Side terms itself a gastropub and even features a chef, Lester Almanzar, who worked at the Punch Bowl, in  London . I just sat outside for a few drinks. This is a very pleasant local bar in which to hang out, far from the frenzy of  Manhattan ’s hot spots. Information: +1-212-222-4050 or  http://theellingtonny.com/ .  Employees Only: The noise level and crush at this West Village bar mean the experience is akin to a rock gig. If that’s your thing and you don’t mind struggling to get served, it’s a good crowd and the cocktails are worth waiting for. The inspiration comes from Prohibition-era speakeasies. Information: +1-212-242-3021 or  http://www.employeesonlynyc.com/ .  Fatty Crab: This tiny and cramped Malaysian restaurant in the West Village still draws the crowds. It’s overcrowded and the music plays at a volume that rules out casual conversation. If you are prepared to shout and go with the flow, Fatty Crab can be fun. The service can be surprisingly prompt for somewhere so rock ’n’ roll. Information: +1-212-352-3592 or  http://www.fattycrab.com/home/ .  Fette Sau: This  Brooklyn  joint isn’t for the faint-hearted. You line up, order a chunk of meat -- the brisket is a specialty -- then settle at a shared table or at the bar and make your way through the large portions. It’s some of the best barbecue you can eat anywhere. All the meats are smoked in house. There’s no fancy decor to distract you, only whiskeys and craft beer. Information: +1-718-963-3404 or  http://www.fettesaubbq.com/ .  Forcella: Giulio Adriani’s Neapolitan pizza restaurant on the Bowery is a good spot for authentic pies, such as the Margherita Extra ($17). Throw in a glass of wine and you are looking at about $30. Adriani grew up in  Rome  and is  certified as a pizza master . His most famous creation is the Montanara, where the dough is flash fried before being finished in a wood-burning oven. Information: +1-212-466-3300 or  http://forcellaeatery.com/ .  Gastronomia Culinaria: This neighborhood Italian restaurant is better than you might expect. Chef Vincenzo Pezzilli, a native of Rome, graduated from Ecole des Arts Culinaires in Lyon,  France , and has wide experience. The food he produces from the tiny kitchen is worth the trip to the Upper West Side. The hospitality is the icing on the cake. Information: +1-212-663-1040 or  http://www.gastronomiaculinaria.com/ .  Grand Sichuan : I visited the Seventh Avenue outlet of this mini-chain. While the room was dimly lit and unattractive, I’d go back like a shot for the food. The menu is eclectic and there are plenty of authentic, spicy Sichuan dishes alongside American-Chinese options such as orange chicken. The prices are low. I got out for under $40 after four small dishes and a beer. Information: +1-212-645-0222 or  http://www.grandsichuannyc.com/ .  Jean Georges : If it’s a special occasion, this three-Michelin-star restaurant is a world beater in its combination of American, French and Asian influences. The ingredients, flavor combinations and presentation are all top-notch. The dining room, overlooking Central Park, is beautiful. Nougatine, next door in Trump International Hotel and Tower, serves great food at less elevated prices. Information: +1-212-299-3900 or  http://www.jean-georges.com/ .  Lafayette: It’s such a commonplace to compare this grand cafe and bakery to Balthazar, I wish I could come up with something else. Chef Damon Wise (ex-Monkey Bar) is here along with Andrew Carmellini. The food is mainly French-Mediterranean. On my visit, I wondered if the kitchen wasn’t overwhelmed by the crowds. This NoHo establishment is becoming very popular. Information: +1-212-533-3000 or  http://lafayetteny.com/ .  Lincoln: This establishment at  Lincoln Center  is easy to miss. It looks expensive and unwelcoming. Yet Chef Jonathan Benno is a real talent, his uncluttered Italian dishes are exemplary and the prices are not sky-high, especially for lunch. It’s a calming place where you look out onto a reflecting pool. Chef Daniel Boulud is among the customers. Information: +1-212-359-6500 or  http://www.lincolnristorante.com/ .  Macao Trading Co: The website says Macao Trading takes its inspiration from the 1930s brothels and opium dens of the then-Portuguese enclave. The dimly lit basement bar of this Tribeca establishment is a great hideaway for quiet cocktails such as Drunken Dragon’s Milk ( Charbay Green Tea Vodka  shaken with young coconut puree, Thai basil and Macao five-spice bitters) at $15. Information: +1-212-431-8750 or  http://www.macaonyc.com/ .  Mandarin Oriental Lobby Lounge : OK, this isn’t a hidden gem. It is, indeed, the lobby lounge of a fancy hotel, with expensive ($19) cocktails. Yet the view of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline, plus the understated Art Deco sophistication of the Mandarin mean it is worth the elevator ride. Information: +1-212-805-8800 or  http://www.mandarinoriental.com/newyork/ .  Maysville: This Flatiron American restaurant and whiskey bar was the best surprise of my trip to New York. Chef Kyle Knall, 27, is one to watch. His flavors are big and yet he cooks with finesse. His crispy grits with country ham and bourbon aioli ($9) alone justify a visit to Maysville. The 200 options on the whiskey list may be an incentive. Information: +1-646-490-8240 or  http://www.maysvillenyc.com/ .  Mercer Kitchen: This is a low-key Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant in the basement of the Mercer hotel in Soho. There’s an industrial look, with exposed brick walls, and you might find yourself sitting at a communal table. The menu is eclectic, so you might start with soft-shell crab tempura ($18) followed by tuna pizza ($18) along with a cucumber martini. Information: +1-212-966-5454 or  http://www.themercerkitchen.com/ .  Maison Premiere: The menu at this casual Brooklyn restaurant is simple enough: It’s basically oysters and raw fish, and there are more than 30 choices. The wine list is heavily weighted toward France. Maison Premiere is very popular, so expect a crowd. It’s worth arriving early to try for a table in the garden. Information: +1-347-335-0446 or  http://www.maisonpremiere.com/ .  The Marrow: This is a charming corner restaurant and bar in the West Village. I liked the menu, I enjoyed the cocktails, I loved the British waitress. The only shortcoming when I visited for lunch was the food, which was curiously short on flavor. Information: +1-212-428-6000 or  http://themarrownyc.com/ .  Mission Chinese: You line up outside this Lower East Side joint and might wonder why if you’re expecting regular Chinese fare. Yet the gutsy dishes are loved by the food crowd. The menu may include lamb tongue and cuttlefish terrine ($11) followed by catfish a la Sichuan ($14). It’s a friendly place. Chef Danny Bowien won the James Beard award for  rising star . Information: +1-212-529-8800 or  http://missionchinesefood.com/ny/ .  Il Mulino: This is an old-fashioned, expensive Italian restaurant. The room is dark and would be a good place for assignations if there weren’t so many other diners packed in. (I had a torch, so was able to see the menu.) Il Mulino, which traces its history back three decades, specializes in the cuisine of the Abruzzo region. It’s a throwback, and a good one. Information: +1-212-673-3783 or  http://www.ilmulino.com/ .  Nancy Whiskey Pub : Village Voice featured this Tribeca establishment as one of New York’s best dive bars. There’s a good range of beers and whiskeys and a friendly welcome, yet it may be the shuffleboard and the jukebox that bring you back. Nancy Whiskey feels like it might be a tourist attraction, while it’s a genuine neighborhood bar. Information: +1-212 226-9943 or  http://nancywhiskeypub.com/ .  Nomad: This restaurant and bar in the Nomad Hotel on Broadway is so popular, you have to run the clipboard gauntlet to get in. It is worth it. The quirky rooms are remarkable and the food is first class and the whole-roasted chicken for two ($79) is a showstopper -- one of the great dishes of New York. This establishment is the baby of Will Guidara and Daniel Humm. Information: +1-212-796-1500 or  http://www.thenomadhotel.com .  North End Grill: There’s a $39 weekday lunch menu at this  Danny Meyer  grill, where chef Floyd Cardoz has a garden on the roof. The menu may include chilled cucumber soup with radishes and cherry tomatoes ($13) and rice-flaked halibut with watermelon, watercress and lime ($23). The cooking is modern and refined, the ambience a bit corporate, the service first class, as it is with Meyer. Information: +1-646-747-1600 or  http://northendgrillnyc.com/ .  Peter Luger: If you like your meat red, you should try to get to Peter Luger at least once in our life. This Brooklyn restaurant traces its history to 1887 and is entirely focused on steak. It’s an old-style restaurant without fancy decor or lighting. While the waiters will happily banter with you, don’t expect any fuss or for service to be over-attentive. Information: +1-718-387-7400 or  http://www.peterluger.com/ .  Pod 39 : This is the rooftop bar and lounge at Salvation Taco. The views are great and it’s a lively crowd. The drinks are pretty good, too, if you can get them. You may find yourself in line even to get to Pod 39 and then face a long wait for service at the crowded and understaffed bar. It’s worth it -- just. This is a great bar to hang out in if you are not thirsty. Information:  http://www.thepodhotel.com/ .  Red Rooster: This restaurant and bar reflects Harlem’s cultural diversity and the neighborhood’s evolution toward fashionability. More than that, it’s a fun place to hang out and enjoy cocktails such as the Brownstone -- nutmeg-infused  Bulleit Bourbon ,  Cherry Heering , St. Germain -- and Chef  Marcus Samuelsson ’s comfort food. Gospel Sunday brunch is also a hit. Information: +1-212-792-9001 or  http://redroosterharlem.com/ .  Rye : This Williamsburg neighborhood restaurant’s happy hour features cheeseburgers and old fashioneds at $5 a pop between 5:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. It’s also worth going later for chef-owner Cal Elliott’s menu, which features dishes such as Long Island duck breast with Moroccan-style couscous, lemon confit, spinach and tomato chutney ($28). Information: +1-718-218-8047 or  http://www.ryerestaurant.com/ .  Salvation Taco: This is a lively, noisy, colorful and sometimes crowded restaurant in a former Salvation Army hostel in Murray Hill. It’s not one for purists. The tacos include Moroccan lamb on naan ($6) and Korean BBQ ($5). It’s owned by Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield of the Spotted Pig. It’s worth visiting for the vibe and the energy. Information: +1-212-865-5800 or  http://www.salvationtaco.com/ .  Schapiro’s: This is a new cocktail bar and bistro on the Lower East Side. The name references a long-gone Jewish winery. The food is modern American with Jewish influences, featuring matzo ball soup and bagel on lox. It’s the cocktails that may draw people. Ajax Kentish, the launch bar manager at Polpo in London, was serving the drinks when I dropped by. Information: +1-212-533-6089 or  http://www.schapirosnyc.com/ .  Shahi Biryani & Grill: In the unlikely event you find yourself out and about in Manhattan Valley in the early hours with a hankering for Pakistani dishes, this inexpensive Halal joint may be for you. The food is authentic and unfussy and the place is open until 2 a.m. Information: +1 212-222-8820 or 71 West 109th St. (between Columbus and Manhattan Avenue) NY 10025.  Tribeca Grill: Drew Nieporent, whose restaurant this is, is also one of the owners of Nobu, along with  Robert De Niro . This is an unpretentious establishment, good for steak and salad, crab cake or seared sea scallops. It’s easy to overlook a spot like this, with good service, regular food and a fine selection of American wines. Tribeca Grill doesn’t need to be fashionable. Information: +1-212-941-3900 or  http://bit.ly/KzdvOf .  Trix : I wandered into this corner bar in Brooklyn after interviewing chef Paul Liebrandt, whose new Williamsburg restaurant is the Elm. According to the website, the owners collaborated with artist James Johnson to pay homage to Belinda’s go-go lounge, which occupied the site in the 1980s. I didn’t eat, just sat outside for happy hour drinks. Information: +1-347-599-0702/or  http://www.trixnyc.com/ .
