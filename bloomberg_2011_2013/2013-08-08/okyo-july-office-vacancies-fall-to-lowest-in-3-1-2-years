Tokyo ’s office  vacancies  in July fell
to the lowest level in three and a half years because of a lack
of new supply, according to broker Miki Shoji Co.  The rate, a measurement of unoccupied space, fell to 8.29
percent last month from 8.46 percent in June, according to data
released today by the closely held Tokyo-based company. The July
rate was the lowest since January 2010 when it was 8.25 percent.  The office market in Japan’s capital is improving as new
supply this year is expected to be about 40 percent of the level
in 2012, according to broker DTZ. The vacant space of 12,000
tsubo (39,700 square meters or 427,000 square feet) was absorbed
in a month, Miki Shoji said in today’s report.  One tsubo, a standard measure of property area in  Japan , is
3.3 square meters, or 35.5 square feet.  The Topix Real Estate Index fell 0.6 percent at the close
in Tokyo, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index dropped 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
