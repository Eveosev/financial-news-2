Italian and Spanish 10-year bonds
climbed for a third day after a report showed Chinese exports to
 Europe  increased for the first time in five months, adding to
signs the region’s economy is gathering pace.  Germany’s bonds advanced for a second day as  Fitch Ratings 
affirmed its AAA rating with stable outlook. China’s exports and
imports rebounded more than analysts estimated in July in a sign
that the world’s second-largest economy is stabilizing. The  Bank
of England  yesterday raised its growth forecasts for the U.K.
while pledging to keep inflation low.  “The Chinese export data to Europe is significant in that
it suggested the economic recovery here may be stronger than we
thought,” said Soeren Moerch, head of fixed-income trading at
 Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “That and the improved outlook
of the U.K., the region’s major trading partner plus low
inflation are supporting euro-region bonds, especially
peripherals.”  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.24 percent at 8:39 a.m.
London time. The 4.5 percent security due in May 2023 rose
0.115, or 1.15 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,336) face amount, to
102.39. Similar-maturity Spanish bond yields dropped one basis
point to 4.56 percent.  China ’s shipments abroad rose 5.1 percent from a year
earlier, the General Administration of Customs in Beijing said.
That compares with the median estimate for a 2 percent increase.
Exports to the U.S. and European Union, China’s biggest markets,
rose for the first time in five months.  The 10-year bund yield fell three basis points to 1.66
percent. The rate touched 1.73 percent on Aug. 2, the most since
July 5.  Italian securities returned 4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds lost 1.4 percent and Spain’s gained 6.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
