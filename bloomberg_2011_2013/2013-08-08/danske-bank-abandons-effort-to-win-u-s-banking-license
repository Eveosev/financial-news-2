Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , Denmark’s biggest
lender, cut three jobs in  New York  after deciding to abandon a
four-year effort to win a U.S. banking license, according to an
executive.  “It’s been a laborious process with constantly changing
demands,” Jens Peter Neergaard, Danske Bank’s global head of
markets, said in an interview. “We reached a conclusion that we
didn’t want to pursue it any longer. It’s been very frustrating
that it’s taken so long.”  Without a license Danske Bank won’t be allowed to accept
deposits in the U.S. The Copenhagen-based bank doesn’t need as
much dollar funding as it did when the application was made in
2009, Neergaard said. The bank might instead expand its foreign-exchange business through its U.S. broker-dealer, he said.  “The broker-dealer part has worked well for us,”
Neergaard said. “We’ve gotten 200 new accounts since we got up
and running two years ago and enjoy good business offering our
rates and equities products to U.S. accounts.”  Chief Executive Officer Eivind Kolding said last week that
he may review a goal to more than double the lender’s return on
equity because central banks are keeping interest rates lower
than the company anticipated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
