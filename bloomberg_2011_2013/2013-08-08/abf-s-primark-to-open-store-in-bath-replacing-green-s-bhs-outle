Associated British Food Plc (ABF) ’s Primark fashion chain will open a new outlet in Bath, south-west  England , after taking over a Philip Green-owned Bhs Ltd. department store.  “It’s a one-off, no more than that,” Green, 61, said by phone of the deal for the central Bath outlet on Stall Street. ABF previously bought 10 Bhs stores in the U.K. in 2010.  A Primark spokesman confirmed the retailer will open the outlet in 2014 and declined to give any financial details. Primark, which sells jeans for 10 pounds ($15.56) is the fastest-growing division of London-based ABF, reporting revenue growth of 20 percent in the 16 weeks to June 22, far outpacing the U.K. retail market.
