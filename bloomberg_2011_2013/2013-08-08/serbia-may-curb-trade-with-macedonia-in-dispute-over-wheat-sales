Serbia  may restrict imports from
Macedonia in retaliation for that country’s curbs on wheat and
flour imports from Serbia, the Belgrade-based Trade Ministry
said.  Serbian sales of wheat and flour to Macedonia have halved
to less than 20 million euros ($27 million) a year since the
neighboring nation introduced seasonal restrictions on imports
in 2010, Ivan Markovic, an adviser at the ministry, said by
phone.  “They keep them in place for a few months, right after the
harvest, when it’s crucial time for our exports,” Markovic
said.  Macedonia earlier required companies to buy four tons of
domestically produced flour for every ton imported from Serbia,
the ministry said. The Serbian measures may target some food
imports from Macedonia and may take effect in 10 days unless
Macedonia lifts its restrictions, the ministry said on its
 website  today.  The ministry also called for the removal of trade barriers
to comply with regional accords. Both Balkan countries are in
the Central European Free Trade Agreement, or Cefta, which
prohibits such measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
