Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed for the seventh day after prices of  iron ore , a
key ingredient in steel making, jumped to the highest in more
than three months.  Rebar for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
climbed as much as 0.7 percent to 3,740 yuan ($611) a metric ton,
the highest level since April 17, and was at 3,733 yuan at 10:15
a.m. local time. The price is up 2.4 percent this month.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery rose for a fourth day
yesterday, adding 1.3 percent to $133.10 a dry ton, the highest
since April 30, according to a  price index  compiled by The Steel
Index Ltd. Iron ore entered a  bull market  on July 26 after China
replenished inventories and boosted steel output. China’s
economic-planning agency said this week the construction of
transportation-related infrastructure projects would be
accelerated, adding to efforts to boost domestic demand. The
country is the world’s top user of steel.  “The raw material’s price gain was a major boost to steel
prices,” said Zhang Yichen, an analyst at Yongan Futures Co. in
Beijing. “Rebar is also supported by improved demand prospects
as China may ramp up investments in infrastructure such as
railroads in the second half of this year.”  The average  spot price  of rebar advanced 0.3 percent to
3,476  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
