(Corrects year of Michael Dukakis's defeat in fifth paragraph.) I am confused by Ross Douthat, which is strange because he is an especially clear thinker and writer. In a  post  at the New York Times, he takes issue with liberal responses to a series on political demographics by Sean Trende, in which Trende  argues  that Republicans could survive the next few elections without additional support from minorities -- by padding their vote total with whites. (Trende wasn't necessarily recommending that Republicans do that -- only that they could.) Here's  Douthat: Jonathan Chait, operating on the theory that campaigns like to get as many votes as they can, has  taken issue  with the notion that the Obama campaign wasn't much interested in working-class whites.  But campaigns often sacrifice some votes in search of others. The Republican Southern Strategy factored in the deliberate alienation of black voters in an effort to run up the score among resentful whites. Richard Nixon-hand Pat Buchanan even  hoped  Democrats would be maneuvered into selecting a black vice-presidential nominee, enabling Republicans to “cut the Democratic Party and country in half.” The object, he wrote in a memo, was for Republicans to seize the larger -- whiter -- share of the electorate.  That isn't what's going on in Obama's Democratic Party. The racial composition of Obama's 2012  victory  was almost identical to that of Michael Dukakis's 1988  defeat . (Remember  Willie Horton ?) Obama got 39 percent of the white vote; Dukakis got 40 percent. Obama also received about the same share of the Hispanic vote as Dukakis. Obama did better among blacks, both in vote percentage and in turnout. But even Dukakis received 89 percent of the black vote. Dukakis wasn't blowing off working-class whites, and neither was Obama. Obama simply benefited from the change in demographics. In 1988, whites were 85 percent of the presidential vote. In 2012, they were 72 percent. I understand why Douthat focused on guns and abortion: They're the perennial social-wedge issues. But Obama's efforts at regulating guns were not only in the same ballpark as those of Clinton, who Douthat posits as solicitous of working-class whites, they were actually less extensive. Unlike Clinton, Obama put virtually no effort behind an assault-weapons ban, and his background-check proposal was merely a logical extension of the one signed by Clinton. On abortion, Douthat has an equally odd interpretation of events. In Texas, North Carolina and elsewhere, Republican legislatures are nullifying the constitutional right to an abortion, by regulating abortion clinics out of existence while placing additional restrictions on abortion rights. The Obama administration's moves on abortion, most of which concern insurance coverage, are incremental compared with the dramatic leaps being taken -- in the opposite direction -- by red-state legislatures. If abortion is especially  contentious  right now, it's not because of the Obama administration. So we have a Democratic president who has pursued a less ambitious agenda on guns than Clinton, and a far less ambitious agenda on abortion than contemporary Republicans. In addition, his signature policy achievement, the Affordable Care Act, is designed to help precisely the sort of non-college whites (and blacks and browns) that Douthat says Obama has written off.  Obama has indeed written off "immigration skeptics and coal-country populists." There is no denying that. He can't please the first group while trying to make citizens of 11 million undocumented immigrants. He can't please the second while creating a better life for the rest of the planet. So, yes, Obama has alienated whites who are opposed to legalizing immigrants and who are devoted to dirty energy. But working-class whites in general? As Larry Bartels and  others  have  shown , Obama's "white working class" problem is largely a regional phenomenon. White southerners and residents of Appalachia don't like the president. They didn't like him in 2008. They probably won't like him when he leaves office in 2017.  If a white Democrat gets the Democratic nomination in 2016 and runs on a platform very similar to Obama's, I have a feeling she'll do better.
