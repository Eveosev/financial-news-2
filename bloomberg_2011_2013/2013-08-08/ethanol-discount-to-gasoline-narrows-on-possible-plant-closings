Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
narrowed for a second day on concern that tight corn supply
before September’s harvest will force producers to cut output.  The spread, or price difference, contracted 0.85 cent to
67.76 cents a gallon after the Agriculture Department estimated
corn stockpiles will be 26 percent lower than a year earlier.
Ethanol  production  is below average for this time of year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It could just be an issue of making it through the end of
the crop cycle,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler
Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois . “A lot of plants are
going to have to shut down. We’ll have to see how that plays
out.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery slipped 0.5 cent
to $2.18 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Futures have
fallen 0.5 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.35 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.8576 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Last year’s corn crop was devastated by the worst drought
since the 1930s, which forced ethanol plants to shutter
operations temporarily. Farmers responded by planting the most
acres of the grain since 1936.  Corn Gains  Corn for September delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $4.735 a bushel in Chicago. The more-actively traded
December contract gained 1.5 cent to $4.5975. One bushel of the
grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of renewable fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 46 cents,
down from 48 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Babler said most traders are watching the volatility in the
market for Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, the
certificates that the U.S. and refiners rely on to track
compliance with government mandates for use of the biofuel.  The Environmental Protection Agency said Aug. 6 that it
would extend the compliance period for this year by four months
and signaled that it may adjust the 2014 targets.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  fell 7 cents to 67 cents, the
lowest level since April 25, while  advanced RINs , which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, slipped 9 cents
to 74 cents, the cheapest since March 28.  Spot Trading  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 10 cents to $2.48 a
gallon on the West Coast, 4.5 cents to $2.395 on the  Gulf Coast 
and 2.5 cents to $2.295 in Chicago, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. In  New York , the biofuel lost 1.5 cents to $2.45 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 5.5
cents to 8.5 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
narrowed 4 cents to 15.5 cents.  Ethanol  production  last week gained 2.5 percent to 853,000
barrels a day, an Energy Information Administration report
showed yesterday. That’s down 11 percent from the record 963,000
barrels a day in December 2011.  Stockpiles increased 1.6 percent to 16.7 million barrels,
down 10 percent from a year earlier, the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, said.  Ethanol  imports  have averaged 22,000 barrels a day through
Aug. 2, up from 12,000 during the same period in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
