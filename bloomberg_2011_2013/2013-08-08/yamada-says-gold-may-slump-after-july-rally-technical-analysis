Gold may resume a slump following the
July rally of 7.3 percent, the most in 18 months, said  Louise Yamada , the managing director of Technical Research Advisors
LLC, citing momentum and moving-average signals.  The parabolic stop-and-reverse system and a death-cross
formation, with the 10-month moving average below the 20-month
measure, remain intact after the rally, said Yamada, the former
head of technical research at Citigroup Inc. Gold may approach
the 34-month low of $1,179.40 an ounce reached on June 28, the
New York-based analyst said. The metal entered a bear market on
April 12, falling more than 20 percent from the record
settlement of $1,891.90 in August 2011.  “It will need a lot of repair to come out of this bear
market,” Yamada said in a telephone interview. “The recovery
that we have seen is fragile, and monthly momentum is in steep
decline.”  In 2013, gold has dropped 23 percent on the Comex in  New
York  following 12 straight annual gains. Some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value amid a U.S. equity rally
and low inflation.  The parabolic stop-and-reverse system measures price
momentum and gauges a higher-than-normal probability of a change
in direction. The 20-month moving average was $1,583, and the
10-month measure was $1,491.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts use charts
trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
