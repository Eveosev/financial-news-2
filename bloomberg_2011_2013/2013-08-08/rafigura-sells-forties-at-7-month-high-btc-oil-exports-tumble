Trafigura Beheer BV sold  North Sea 
Forties crude at the highest differential in seven months.
Glencore Xstrata Plc sold Russian Urals at a bigger premium than
the previous trade.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from a port in  Turkey 
will tumble to the least in almost five years, a loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed. Shipments of Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk crudes, which make up Dated Brent, will jump
to a seven-month high in September after an August Forties cargo
was said to be deferred, loading programs obtained by Bloomberg
News showed.  North Sea  Trafigura sold Forties lot F0811 for Aug. 26 to Aug. 28
loading at $1.30 a barrel more than Dated Brent, a Bloomberg
survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window showed. That’s the highest since Jan. 4.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $106.74 a barrel
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.55 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $105.19, a discount of 93 cents to September.  Forties cargo F0813 will now load on Sept. 2 to Sept. 4,
four days later than initially planned according to two people
with knowledge of the matter. That brings September loadings to
19 cargoes totaling 11.4 million barrels, or 380,000 barrels a
day compared with a revised 251,613 barrels a day this month.  A total of nine cargoes from the original August loading
program have been deferred.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals to Petraco SpA
for loading Aug. 23 to Aug. 27 at a premium of 70 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent for delivery to Rotterdam, the survey showed.
That’s 15 cents higher than the last trade.  Azeri Light shipments will decline 20 percent to 16.55
million barrels, or 551,667 barrels a day, compared with 691,016
barrels a day in August, according to the schedule.  Iraq set September Basrah Light at a 15-cent premium to the
average of Oman and Dubai grades, the country’s State Oil
Marketing Co., said today in an e-mail. The country set Kirkuk
prices to Europe at a $1.90 a barrel discount to Dated Brent.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. bought one cargo each of Nigerian Agbami
and Angolan Kissanje crudes from BP Plc, and one shipment of
Nigerian Escravos crude from Chevron Corp., three traders with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified
because the information is confidential.  Shipments are of 1 million barrels each and for loading in
October, the people said.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. bought 1 million
barrels of Angolan Dalia for October loading from Glencore
Xstrata Plc, four traders with knowledge of the matter said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
