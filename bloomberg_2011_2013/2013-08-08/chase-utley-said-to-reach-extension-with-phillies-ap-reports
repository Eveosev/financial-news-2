Chase Utley  reached an agreement on a
contract extension that will keep the second baseman with the
 Philadelphia Phillies  through 2015, the  Associated Press  said.  The five-time All-Star’s deal is worth $27 million over two
seasons with multiple vesting options, AP said, citing people
familiar with the transaction.  Utley, 34, is in the final year of an $85 million contract
signed in January 2007 and would have become a free agent after
the Major League Baseball season, AP said.  Utley hit a run-scoring single in the seventh inning and
flied out to center in the ninth in the Phillies 5-2 loss to the
 Chicago Cubs  last night.  As he tried to score from second base in the seventh inning,
Utley knocked over catcher Dioner Navarro, who got the runner
out before being carted off the field with a left ankle injury.
X-rays were negative and Navarro was diagnosed with a bruise,
the Cubs said on their website.  In 84 games this season, Utley is hitting .277 with 15
homers and 43 runs batted in. He hasn’t played more than 115
games in a season since 2009 because of chronic knee problems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
