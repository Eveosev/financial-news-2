Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,  Colombia ’s state-controlled oil company, fell the most in six weeks as crude
dropped on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will trim
stimulus measures.  Ecopetrol’s publicly traded shares plunged 2.5 percent to
4,345 pesos at 1:55 p.m. in Bogota, the most on a closing basis
since June 24. It was the worst performance on the benchmark
Colombian  Colcap index , which lost 0.2 percent. Ecopetrol’s
 weighting  on the measure is 20 percent, the heaviest among its
20 members.  Oil futures in  New York  fell for a fifth day, the longest
stretch of declines since December, as lower-than-forecast U.S.
jobless claims increased expectations that the country’s central
bank will pare bond purchases that have bolstered the economy by
keeping  interest rates  close to zero. Crude tumbled as much as
2.1 percent today after falling 0.9 percent yesterday when
Colombian markets were closed for a holiday.  “Ecopetrol is catching up to declines in oil” given the
the local market was closed yesterday, said Daniel Lozano, head
analyst at brokerage Serfinco SA in Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
