Michigan ’s Saginaw County postponed a
$61 million bond sale planned for today, joining at least two
other localities in the state in delaying offerings after
Detroit filed a record municipal bankruptcy last month.  Larry Magnesen, a spokesman for Cincinnati-based Fifth
Third Bancorp, lead underwriter on the offer, confirmed the
postponement in a telephone interview. The general-obligation
sale was set to be the biggest such deal in Michigan since
Detroit sought court protection on July 18.  Saginaw joins Michigan’s Genesee County and  Battle Creek  in
postponing general obligation offerings. Proceeds would help
Saginaw, with about 198,000 residents, finance unfunded pension
liabilities of about $60 million.  The county, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of  Detroit ,
delayed its sale amid investor speculation that Emergency
Manager Kevyn Orr’s treatment of general-obligation debt could
set a precedent, especially within the state. He offered to
repay holders of the debt about 20 cents on the dollar.  The county gauged investor interest before delaying the
offer, according to three people familiar with the sale who
requested anonymity because the pricing wasn’t final. A portion
maturing in 2023 was offered at about 1.7 percentage points more
than benchmark 10-year Treasuries, the people said.  The securities are rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service,
fourth-highest.  Robert Belleman, Saginaw’s controller, didn’t immediately
return a voicemail and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
