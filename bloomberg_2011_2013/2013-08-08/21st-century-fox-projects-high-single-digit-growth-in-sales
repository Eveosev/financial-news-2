21st Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) ,  Rupert
Murdoch ’s film and TV company, forecasts revenue growth in the
“high single digits” in percentage terms this year. The shares
advanced.  The company, which is holding a meeting with analysts and
investors today, expects fees from pay-television companies to
rise in the “low teens” in percentage terms, Murdoch, the
chairman and chief executive officer, and President Chase Carey
said on a webcast from the meeting.  Fox is counting on that growth as it commits to $4 billion
in share repurchases this year and a 50 percent increase in the
dividend to 25 cents. The company also plans to maintain $2
billion to $3 billion in cash, Carey said. Owners of broadcast
and cable channels rely on rising licensing fees from pay-TV
providers as a second revenue source alongside ad sales.  “People will give up food and a roof over their head
before they give up TV,” Carey said.  CBS Corp. (CBS)  channels in New York,  Los Angeles  and Dallas have
been blocked out for  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  subscribers this
week because of a dispute over such fees.  Fox is forecasting $9 billion in annual earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by fiscal 2016,
about 14 percent more than the $8.85 billion average of 13
analysts’  estimate  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of Fox, which was split off in June from the
publishing operations of Murdoch’s News Corp.,  rose  3.1 percent
to $32.79 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 46
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
