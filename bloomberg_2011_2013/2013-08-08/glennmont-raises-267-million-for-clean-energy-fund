Glennmont Partners , the clean-energy
investor spun off from  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , has raised 200 million
euros ($267 million) for its second fund helped by continued
interest from institutional investors.  New and existing investors have committed to the 10-year
infrastructure fund, which aims to raise as much as 450 million
euros, the London-based asset manager said in a statement today.
The fund targets onshore wind, solar, biomass and small hydro
projects in Europe.  “There is continued appetite for clean-energy investment
in Europe and a good, deep set of opportunities,” Chief
Executive Officer Joost Bergsma said by phone. Since the spin
off in January, “we have attracted have a good mix of
institutional investors, including insurance companies, pension
funds and consultants.”  Glennmont, which also manages a 437 million-euro fund it
raised as BNP Paribas Clean Energy Partners, is one of  Europe ’s
largest specialist investors in renewable energy. It has
invested in about 15 clean-energy assets since 2007.  The second fund will also target medium-sized projects in
operation or construction, according to Bergsma. It will focus
on the French and U.K. markets primarily, as well as other
northern European countries, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
