China’s yuan climbed to a 19-year
high after the central bank strengthened the currency’s
reference rate for the fourth straight day and exports growth
beat forecasts.  Overseas  shipments  rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier in
July after contracting 3.1 percent in June, official data showed
today. That exceeded the median estimate of 2 percent growth in
a Bloomberg survey.  Imports (CNFRIMPY)  advanced 10.9 percent, higher than
the forecast of a 1 percent gain. The People’s Bank of China
raised the daily  fixing  0.04 percent to 6.1703 per dollar, the
strongest since July 24.  “We are seeing more signs that China’s economy is
stabilizing, and that’s positive for the yuan and its global
usage,” said Kenix Lai, a foreign-exchange analyst at Bank of
East Asia Ltd. “Sentiment has improved on speculation that the
leadership will roll out measures to support growth.”  The currency rose 0.05 percent to 6.1164 per dollar as of
11:39 a.m. in  Shanghai , China Foreign Exchange Trade System
prices show. That’s the strongest level since the government
unified the official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993. The currency was at a 0.88 percent premium to the fixing,
close to the maximum allowed 1 percent.  The  yuan  has gained 1.86 percent against the dollar this
year, making it the best performer among 24 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The average yield on Dim Sum
bonds fell to the lowest since June 20 this week on the yuan’s
rally, a Deutsche Bank AG and Standard & Poor’s index shows. The
nation’s foreign-exchange position may resume “moderate”
growth, China Securities Journal reported, citing people it
didn’t identify.  ’Worries Over’  The yuan extended gains in the offshore market after
China’s data. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.11
percent to 6.2700 per dollar in Hong Kong, a 2.4 percent
 discount  to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The offshore spot advanced 0.06 percent to a record
6.1144.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.2
percent. That’s the lowest since April 1.  “Trade data for July comes in much stronger than
expected,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at
Credit Agricole CIB, wrote in a note today. “All this confirms
our view that the economy has bottomed out and will re-accelerate in the second half. We’d like to call the end to
worries over  China  for this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
