Corpbanca, the lender controlled by
Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh, rallied after Grupo BTG
Pactual said the closing of a new acquisition in Colombia will
boost profit growth and reiterated a buy rating.  Corpbanca rose 0.8 percent to 5.31 pesos at 3:24 p.m. in
Santiago. A close at that level would be the highest since July
18. Volume today was almost three times the average of the past
90 days and the stock was the most active by value in Santiago,
with 7.3 billion pesos ($14 million) changing hands. The  IPSA (IPSA) 
climbed 1.6 percent, snapping four days of losses.  Corpbanca,  Chile ’s fourth-largest non-state owned lender,
said in an Aug. 6 statement that it had received approval from
regulators to close the $1.3 billion acquisition of Helm Bank
SA. BTG Pactual reiterated a buy rating, citing the $100 million
in savings and the 20 percent jump in assets Corpbanca will
obtain as it merges Helm with Banco Corpbanca Colombia.
Corpbanca’s second-quarter earnings jumped 55 percent from a
year earlier to 43.7 billion pesos.  The results show encouraging trends “despite headwinds in
Chile from low inflation,” BTG Pactual analysts Alonso Aramburu, Felipe Ucros and Eduardo Rosman said yesterday in a
research note to clients. “Results from Corpbanca  Colombia  have
been particularly strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
