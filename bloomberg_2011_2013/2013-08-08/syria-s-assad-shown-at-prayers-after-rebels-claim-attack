Syria ’s President Bashar al-Assad
was shown attending early Eid al-Fitr prayers today following
opposition reports that his convoy had been targeted by mortars
on its way to the mosque.  Firas Bitar, a leader of the rebel al-Sham Liberation
Brigade, told Al Arabiya television station that his group
fired 17 mortar rounds at vehicles that may have been taking
Assad to the mosque. He said two motorcades were heading toward
the building, one of them a decoy.  Rami Abdurrahman, founder of the U.K.-based Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights , which has a network of activists
in Syria, said at most three mortars fell in Malki, each about
an hour apart and one of them before prayers started.  Following the reports, Syria’s state-run television showed
Assad, dressed in a suit, praying at a mosque in Malki,
surrounded by officials.  Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said Assad drove his
car to the mosque and shook hands and spoke with citizens as is
his habit before leaving.  Assad has been fighting an uprising that began in March
2011 and has killed at least 100,000 people, according to United
Nations estimates made last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
