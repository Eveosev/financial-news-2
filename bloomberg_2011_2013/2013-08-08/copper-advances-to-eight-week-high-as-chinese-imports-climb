Copper climbed to an eight-week high
in New York after imports jumped to the highest in 14 months in
 China , the world’s top metals user.  Shipments to China of unwrought copper and copper products
rose to 410,680 metric tons in July, the highest since May 2012,
customs agency data showed today. Total exports from the Asian
country rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, compared with a
median 2 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey and June’s 3.1
percent drop. Copper fell 13 percent this year through yesterday
amid concern that efforts to keep  China’s economy  from
overheating would curb metals demand.  “It does appear as though the Chinese central economic
authorities are transitioning their attention back to
fundamental economic development, after having skimmed some
speculative froth,” Michael Turek, a senior director at Newedge
Group SA in  New York , said by e-mail. The shift is helping push
markets toward “more positive upside momentum, rather than the
sideways price action we have been encumbered with recently.”  Copper futures for delivery in September rose 3.1 percent
to settle at $3.2705 a pound at 1:20 p.m. on Comex in New York.
Prices reached $3.2795, the highest since June 11, and climbed
above the 100-day moving average for the first time since
February.  Total Chinese imports advanced almost 11 percent, leaving a
trade surplus of $17.8 billion. The government signaled last
month that it will defend its 7.5 percent economic-growth target
for the year after expansion slowed for a second quarter.  Copper stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange
fell for the 17th straight session to the lowest since April 12.  Aluminum for delivery in three months jumped 2.4 percent,
the most since July 1, to $1,840 a metric ton on the LME. Rio
Tinto Group plans to stop production at its Shawinigan, Quebec,
smelter with a capacity of 100,000 tons a year by the end of
November because of dated technology and low prices.  Aluminum has dropped 11 percent this year.  On the LME, copper, nickel, zinc, lead and tin also rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
