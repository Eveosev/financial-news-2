Mondi Ltd. (MND) , a South African maker of
paper and packaging, said first-half earnings rose 35 percent as
acquisitions made toward the end of 2012 helped to offset the
impact of sluggish economies.  Underlying operating profit for the six months through June
advanced to 366 million euros ($488 million), compared with 272
million euros a year earlier, the company said in a statement
today. Sales for the period rose to 3.34 billion euros from 2.82
billion euros, it said.  “A strong operating performance and benefits derived from
our strategic acquisitions completed towards the end of the
previous year have enabled Mondi to deliver record financial
results despite what remains a challenging economic backdrop,”
Mondi Chief Executive Officer David Hathorn said.  The company raised its half-year dividend by 7 percent to
9.55 euro cents a share.  Mondi’s earnings improved even after taking a special items
charge of 68 million euros, resulting from restructuring plans
in Europe and South Africa. The Johannesburg-based company is
reducing its exposure to stagnant economies and expanding in
developing markets such as Eastern Europe.  Mondi shares have gained  64 percent  this year, the fourth-best performer of the  166-member FTSE/JSE Africa All-Share
Index. (JALSH)  The stock rose 1.4 percent to 151 rand at the close of
trading yesterday, the highest since July 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
