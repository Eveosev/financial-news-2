Western  Australia  forecast a budget
deficit of A$147 million ($134 million) in the year to June 30,
2015, as a China-led mining investment boom wanes and slowing
growth curbs government revenues.  The projected deficit will follow a forecast surplus of
A$386 million in the 2013-14 fiscal year, state Treasurer Troy Buswell said in a statement today. Growth is forecast to slow to
2.5 percent in 2014-15 from an estimated 3.25 percent this
fiscal year and 5.75 percent in 2012-13, according to budget
papers.  “As major resource projects transition from a construction
phase to a production phase, the demand for labor has begun to
ease, and so has growth in the state government’s tax revenue,”
Buswell said in the statement. Net debt for the total public
sector is forecast to increase to A$28.4 billion by June 30,
2017, from an estimated A$18.5 billion at June 30, 2013.  The challenges faced by Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett mirrors slowing growth and declining revenue nationally,
that prompted federal Treasurer Chris Bowen to forecast last
week the budget deficit will blow out to A$30.1 billion this
fiscal year. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and opposition leader
Tony Abbott have put management of the nation’s $1.5 trillion
economy at the center of their election campaigns ahead of a
Sept. 7 ballot.  “There are indications activity has slowed a bit there,
with the capital expenditure boom coming to an end,” Stephen Walters, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief economist in Australia,
said before the state’s budget announcement today. “The state’s
royalties still look okay because commodity prices are holding
up and there should be big increases in volumes given all the
new investment that has been put in place.”  Gorgon Project  Work is progressing on  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s A$52 billion Gorgon
liquefied natural gas project and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s expansions
to iron ore operations. The state is home to mining magnates
such as  Gina Rinehart , Australia’s richest person, and  Fortescue
Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)  founder Andrew Forrest.  Australia’s largest state by area, with 2.6 million square
kilometers (1 million square miles) of land, earned A$97 billion
from minerals and energy sales in 2012, down from A$108 billion
in 2011, according to  government figures . The state produced
A$51 billion of iron ore last year, a record A$24.4 billion of
petroleum products -- including A$11 billion of LNG -- and A$9.4
billion of gold.  The state’s unemployment rate of 4.6 percent is lower than
the national average of 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
