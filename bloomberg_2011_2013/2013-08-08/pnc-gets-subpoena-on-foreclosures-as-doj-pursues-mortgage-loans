     Aug. 8 (Bloomberg) -- PNC Financial Services Group Inc. got
a U.S. subpoena tied to foreclosure expenses on federally backed
home loans and said two agencies are investigating whether its
mortgages were unfairly priced.  The  Department of Justice  told PNC in June it may file a
civil complaint tied to an investigation into “whether mortgage
loan pricing by National City and PNC had a disparate impact on
protected classes,” according to a regulatory  filing  today. The
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has authorized settlement
talks, the Pittsburgh-based bank said. PNC purchased National
City Corp., one of the nation’s biggest subprime home lenders,
in 2009.  Additionally, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York wants information about expenses tied to
foreclosures of loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal
Housing Administration,  Fannie Mae  or Freddie Mac, according to
the filing. PNC said it’s cooperating with the  investigation ,
which is in its early stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
