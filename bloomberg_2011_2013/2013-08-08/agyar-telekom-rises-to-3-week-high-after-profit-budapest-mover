Magyar Telekom Nyrt. rose to the
highest level in three weeks after quarterly profit at Hungary’s
largest telecommunication-service provider beat estimates.  Shares of the unit of  Germany ’s  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  climbed
0.9 percent to 325 forint at the close in Budapest. That’s the
highest level since July 18 and brings the gain over the past
five days to 4.5 percent. The stock was the most-traded on the
benchmark  BUX Index (BUX) , which surged 2.8 percent.  Second-quarter net income climbed 14 percent to 12.2
billion forint ($54.5 million), beating the 11.2 billion forint
average estimate of 10 analysts on Bloomberg. The company, which
posted a 7.9 percent increase in quarterly sales, said today it
expects higher revenue for the year, compared with a June
forecast that predicted no change.  The strong results surpassed expectations and may spark a
rally in the stock from its current level, KBC Securities in
Budapest said in an e-mailed note today.  Since rising to power in 2010, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban 
has levied extraordinary taxes on telecommunications companies.
Shares of Magyar Telekom slumped to a record low on July 30,
triggered by higher taxes on phone calls and speculation the
stock’s  weighting  in  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s Hungarian basket of equities
will be cut in an index review this month.  The shares have plunged 13 percent this year, compared with
a 3.4 percent increase for the benchmark gauge. Four  analysts 
recommend investors buy the stock, while eight say hold and four
say sell, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
