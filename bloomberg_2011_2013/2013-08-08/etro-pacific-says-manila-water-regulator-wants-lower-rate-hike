Maynilad Water Services Inc. is in
talks with the Metropolitan Waterworks & Sewerage System on a
rate increase that’s acceptable to the regulator, said Jose Lim,
president of  Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPI)  which has a stake
in the utility.  The regulator “informally indicated” a water rate that’s
lower than what Manila Water sought for approval, Lim told
reporters during a Metro Pacific briefing today. He didn’t
elaborate. Metropolitan Waterworks is evaluating the petition of
Maynilad and Manila Water Co. for higher rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
