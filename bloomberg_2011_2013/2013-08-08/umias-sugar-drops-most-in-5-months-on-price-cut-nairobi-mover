Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s largest
miller of the sweetener, plunged the most in more than five
months after Sterling Capital Ltd. cut its price target on the
company’s shares by more than half.  The stock fell 2.4 percent to 4.10 shillings by the close
in the capital, Nairobi, the biggest decline since Feb. 28 and
the lowest level in more than a month. Almost 77 percent of the
three-month average volume of shares were traded.  The target was cut to 4.32 shillings from the 9.20
shillings set in July 2012, Maureen Kirigua, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today. In
February, Mumias said earnings for the year through June would
be more than 25 percent lower than the previous period.  Revenue from sugar is expected to decline “on account of
challenges faced in cane procurement and heightened competition
within the sugar industry,” the brokerage said in an e-mailed
note. “We reiterate our sell recommendation.”  In the first half through December, the company reported a
loss of 1.1 billion shillings ($12.6 million) from a profit of
825.2 million shillings. Kenyan sugar manufacturing declined 8.2
percent in the first three months of 2013, while output of sugar
cane dropped 23 percent, according to the Kenya National Bureau
of Statistics  Mumias is the fourth-worst performer this year on the FTSE
NSE Kenya 25 Index, retreating 15 percent, compared with the
gauge’s 29 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
