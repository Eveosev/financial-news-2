Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN) , which
manages $11 billion in emerging-markets debt, is buying  Brazil ’s
10-year domestic bonds as the nation’s annual inflation rate
ebbed from a 20-month high.  “Brazil is a country we have been adding,” Brett Diment,
the head of emerging-markets debt at Aberdeen, said in an
interview in  London . “You can get 10-year rates north of 11
percent. Inflation has probably peaked, so we like that.”  Annual inflation as measured by the benchmark IPCA consumer
price index slowed to 6.27 percent in July from 6.7 percent in
the prior month, the national statistics agency reported
yesterday. The central bank’s preferred range is 2.5 percent to
6.5 percent.  Yields on Brazilian notes maturing in 2023 dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 11.15 percent at 3:05
p.m. in  Sao Paulo . They climbed to 11.63 percent on June 21, the
highest since they first traded in March 2012.  Aberdeen is overweight on the Russian ruble, which has
tumbled 7 percent this year against the dollar, one of the worst
performances among major emerging-market currencies.  “Our bigger risk positions are actually in onshore rates
in  Russia ,” Diment said. “We think there is a chance they will
probably cut rates later this month or in September.”  Russia’s central bank will keep the refinancing rate at
8.25 percent tomorrow, according to the median forecast of 20
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
