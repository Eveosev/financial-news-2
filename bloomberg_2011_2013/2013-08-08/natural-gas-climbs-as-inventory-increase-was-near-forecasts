Natural gas futures gained in  New
York  for the first time in six days, rebounding from a 25-week
low, after a government report showed a stockpile increase that
was near analyst forecasts.  Gas climbed 1.5 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said a U.S. supply increase of 96 billion cubic
feet included about 14 billion that was reclassified from base
gas to working gas. Analysts expected a gain of 79 billion.  “The reclassification means that supplies really rose by
82 billion cubic feet, which is not the monster injection that
people initially thought it was,” said Aaron Calder, an analyst
at Gelber & Associates in Houston. “The trade has been really
overcrowded on the short side and we’ve been in oversold
territory.”  Natural gas for September delivery rose 5 cents to settle
at $3.297 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 76 percent above the
average at 2:44 p.m. Prices have declined 1.6 percent this year.
Prices fell to $3.129 per million British thermal units, the
lowest intraday price since Feb. 15, immediately following the
report before rebounding.  The discount of September to October futures narrowed 0.1
cent to 2.4 cents.  October $3 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 1.6 cents lower at 4 cents per million Btu on
volume of 1,276 at 3:27 p.m. Puts accounted for 57 percent of
trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in September was 31.85 percent at 3:15 p.m., compared
with 33.11 percent yesterday.  The relative strength index, or RSI, for the front-month
contract was 34.8 at 3:18 p.m. after slipping to 28.1 yesterday.
A drop below 30 is considered by some traders to be a buy
signal, while a number above 70 can be a signal to sell.  EIA Report  Gas dropped as much as 3.6 percent after the EIA said
stockpiles climbed in the week ended Aug. 2 to 2.941 trillion
cubic feet. Supplies were 0.7 percent above the five-year
average, rising to a surplus for the first time since March.  MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said the
weather may be hotter than average in  Texas  through Aug. 22.  The high in  Dallas  on Aug. 21 may be 101 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 Celsius), 5 more than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc. 
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Power generation accounts for 32
percent of U.S. gas demand, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  “We could certainly have an extended period of hotter
weather that would support prices,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at Intl FCStone Inc. in St. Lois Park,
 Minnesota .  Goldman Outlook  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is maintaining its view that the
U.S. will increase liquefied natural gas exports to 6 billion
cubic feet a day by 2021,  Jeffrey Currie , an analyst at the bank
in New York, said in an e-mailed note to clients dated
yesterday.  The Energy Department approved Lake Charles Exports LLC’s
application yesterday to ship natural gas from its terminal in
 Louisiana  to countries that lack free-trade agreements with the
U.S. The U.S. previously approved such exports from the Sabine
Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana and the Freeport LNG terminal in
Texas. About 19  applications  are pending at the department.  The U.S. cut its 2013 production estimate for marketed
natural gas to 69.89 billion cubic feet a day from last month’s
forecast of 69.96 billion, the EIA said Aug. 6 in in its Short-Term Energy Outlook. Output may rise 1 percent from a year ago
to a record as onshore supplies climb.  Stockpiles may total 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the end of
October, about 130 billion below last year’s peak for the time
of year, the agency said.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first four months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1985, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
