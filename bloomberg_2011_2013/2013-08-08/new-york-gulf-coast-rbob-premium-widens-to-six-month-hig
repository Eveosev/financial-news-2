Gasoline in the New York Harbor
traded at the biggest premium to the U.S. Gulf Coast in six
months as imports to the U.S. East Coast dropped and area
refineries processed the  least crude oil  since March.  The New York Harbor-Gulf Coast spread for reformulated
gasoline, or RBOB, widened 2.17 cents to 13.05 cents a gallon at
3:33 p.m., New York’s  biggest  premium since Feb. 6, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The regional gap stretched after a government report showed
yesterday that  gasoline imports  to the U.S. East Coast slipped
to 584,000 barrels in the week ended Aug. 2. At the same time,
area refineries processed  1.1 million barrels  a day of crude and
other feedstock, the least since March 22.  Shipments to the East Coast along Colonial Pipeline Co.’s
main gasoline line, which transports fuel from Houston to the
East, were allocated for cycles 37 to 45, signaling strong
pipeline flows. When a company issue an allocation, it means
demanded has exceeded a line’s capacity.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins based on Brent oil in Europe, gained 11 cents
to $16 a barrel. The  same spread  on the Gulf Coast, based on
West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , increased 55 cents
to $11.40 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
