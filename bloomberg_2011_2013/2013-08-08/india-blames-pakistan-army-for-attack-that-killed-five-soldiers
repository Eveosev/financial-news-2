Defense Minister A.K. Antony said for
the first time that Pakistani troops were involved in an attack
that killed five Indian soldiers earlier this week along the
nations’ shared border in the disputed region of Kashmir.  After  India ’s army chief visited the area it became clear
that “specialist troops” from Pakistan’s army were behind the
raid, Antony told parliament in New Delhi today. Opposition
parties had accused the minister of contradicting military
commanders in earlier statements to lawmakers, which alluded to
the strike being carried out by militants.  Nothing happens on the Pakistani side of the border without
the support, assistance and facilitation of the country’s army,
Antony said after protests over two days had disrupted
parliament.  “Naturally, this incident will have consequences on our
behavior on the Line of Control and for our relations with
Pakistan,” Antony said. Hours after the incident, he told
parliament that 20 heavily-armed “terrorists” along with men
dressed in  Pakistan  army uniforms were responsible.  Pakistan’s foreign ministry in a statement rejected the
charges as baseless and unfounded. Pakistan’s military had no
record of such an incident and the country is committed to a
2003 cease-fire agreement, the ministry said.  The killings may hobble efforts to resume a peace dialogue
between the nuclear-armed rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
