Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s
largest gold producer, will write down the value of its assets,
which the company flagged in June, by about A$6.2 billion ($5.6
billion), after a slump in prices.  The writedown charge for four mines in Australia,  Papua New
Guinea  and Africa and its stake in  Evolution Mining Ltd. (EVN)  is
approximate and is subject to audit, Melbourne-based Newcrest
said today in a statement.The company, which will report full-year earnings next week, has a market value of A$8.6 billion.  Newcrest’s June estimate of a writedown of between A$5
billion and A$6 billion didn’t include the A$273 million
Evolution writedown and A$360 million for other assets. Newcrest
joins rivals including Newmont Mining Corp., the second-largest
producer, in making writedowns after gold prices fell into a
bear market in April.  Newcrest is cutting spending, suspending high-cost
operations and closing its Brisbane office, which has about 100
staff, it said in June.  Newcrest declined 0.5 percent to A$11.22 at 4:10 p.m. in
Sydney trading. Its shares have fallen 49 percent this year,
making the it the worst performer among  Australia ’s  50 biggest
publicly traded companies .  To contact the reporter on this story:
