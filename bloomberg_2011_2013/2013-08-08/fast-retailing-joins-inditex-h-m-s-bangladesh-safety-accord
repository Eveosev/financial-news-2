Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , Asia’s largest
clothing retailer, joined  Inditex SA (ITX)  and  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  in
signing an accord to improve factory safety in  Bangladesh  after
an April garment complex collapse killed more than 1,000 people.  Fast Retailing has independently reviewed fire and building
conditions at plants run by its partners in Bangladesh and
detailed results are expected by November, it said in today’s
 statement .  Inditex and H&M, Europe’s two largest clothing retailers,
signed the safety pact initiated by international organizations
IndustriAll Global Union and UNI Global Union, after an eight-story garment complex collapsed in April in Bangladesh’s worst
industrial disaster. The accord includes plans to survey all
factories on related risks within the next two years and
implement reforms to improve conditions, Fast Retailing said.  Seventeen North American retailers, including Gap Inc. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., announced a separate five-year plan
earlier in July to improve factory safety in the country.  About 70 percent of the Japanese retailer’s production
comes from  China  with the rest coming from Southeast and South
Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Keiji Furukawa, the
company’s spokesman, said today. The company plans to reduce the
percentage of clothes it produces in China to about two-thirds
as it seeks to diversify risks and improve efficiency, he said.
None of the company’s suppliers or workers were involved in the
April building collapse, Furukawa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
