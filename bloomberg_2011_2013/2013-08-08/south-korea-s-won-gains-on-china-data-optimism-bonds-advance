South Korea’s won rose for the first
time in three days before the release of data that may show
China’s exports rebounded last month.  Government bonds  gained.  The  Bank of Korea  kept its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 2.5 percent today, as forecast by all 16 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. Shipments from China, South Korea’s
biggest trading partner, probably grew 2 percent from a year
earlier  in July after a surprise 3.1 percent contraction in
June, according to another Bloomberg survey.  “If China’s trade data come out as expected, that will
support the won,” said Jung Sung Yoon, a currency trader at
Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul. “Exporters are also selling
dollars to take advantage of the won’s fall.”  The currency advanced 0.4 percent to 1,114.60 per dollar as
of 10:25 a.m. in Seoul after falling 0.4 percent in the previous
two days, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, climbed three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.04 percent.  The won’s swap rates with the dollar surged yesterday as SK
Innovation Co. said it raised $350 million in a sale of bonds.
Any attempt by the oil refiner to exchange the proceeds into won
may push the currency swap points higher, Shinhan Bank said in a
client note yesterday.  The yield on the 2.75 percent sovereign bonds due June 2016
fell two basis points to 2.93 percent, according to Korea
Exchange Inc. prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
