Treasury 30-year bonds rose as the
U.S. prepared to sell $16 billion of the debt at yields close to
the highest level at an auction of the maturity in two years.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note touched the lowest
level this month after U.S. sold $24 billion of the securities
yesterday and $32 billion in three-year notes the previous day,
drawing above-average demand from foreign investors. Bond
managers must adapt to a “new world” of near zero-round
 interest rates  and the likelihood of lower total returns,
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  wrote in his
monthly investment outlook.  “Given the indirect participation at the three-year and
10-year auctions, people are optimistic bonds will benefit from
elevated non-dealer bidding,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford,
 Connecticut .  The yield on 30-year bonds  fell  three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.65 percent at 12:11 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.875 percent
security due May 2043 added 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face
amount, to 85 31/32.  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell two basis points to
2.58 percent, after touching the lowest level since July 31.  Bond Pattern  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.63 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 3.66 percent at a previous
auction of similar-maturity debt on July 11. That was the
highest in almost two years.  Investors in U.S. government securities have lost 2.6
percent this year, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index (BUSY)  as of yesterday.  U.S. debt  gained 2 percent in 2012. The
30-year bond lost investors 11.9 percent this year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  Reducing maturity isn’t the only potential strategy to win
this new war, Gross wrote in his outlook, adding that investors
should focus on “carry,” a strategy that involves capitalizing
on yield-curve differences, volatility, credit spreads, maturity
extension and currency variations.  Another investor concluded that investors should sell bonds
as the 30-year bull-run in fixed-income securities is drawing to
an end.  “We believe that this is a generational selling
opportunity for investors in the 20-year Treasury and other long
duration bonds,” James O’Shaughnessy, chief executive officer
of O’Shaughnessy Asset Management in  Stamford , Connecticut,
wrote in a note to clients. “In my lifetime, I will never again
see returns to the long bond as high as those achieved for the
10-, 20-, and 40- years through March 2009.”  Investors should reduce bond maturity durations before it
is too late, he added.  Asset Allocation  Institutional investors’ allocations to dollar-denominated
bonds have dropped to the lowest level since 2007 as strategists
at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. see a shift away from
the debt that may fuel higher borrowing costs.  Holdings by investors from pensions to endowments fell to
26.2 percent of assets in the second quarter, from 30.1 percent
in the corresponding period of 2012, according to the Wilshire
Trust Universe Comparison Service, which tracks plans that
oversee $3.46 trillion. Morgan Stanley’s $1.8 trillion  wealth
management unit  has been advising clients to cut bond
allocations to the lowest in more than five years, Chief
Investment Strategist  David Darst  said.  The  yield  on 10-year Treasuries reached 2.75 percent on
July 8 from a low this year of 1.61 percent on May 1, triggered
by Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who rattled markets
in May and June by outlining a plan to end the central bank’s
unprecedented asset purchases.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
debt each month to put downward pressure on interest rates. It
purchased $3.22 billion of Treasuries maturing from August 2020
to November 2022 today. Policy makers are discussing whether the
economy has improved enough for them to start reducing the
purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
