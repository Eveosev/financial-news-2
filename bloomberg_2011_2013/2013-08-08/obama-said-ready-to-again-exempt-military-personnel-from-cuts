The Obama administration will notify
Congress as soon as tomorrow that it will once again exempt
military personnel from the automatic budget cuts known as
sequestration, according to two government officials.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel this week sent President
 Barack Obama  a memo outlining his request for the exemption for
fiscal 2014 and the rationale, said the officials, who asked not
to be identified before the notification is issued.  The Pentagon’s $526.6 billion budget request for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1, not including war funds, would provide
$137.1 billion to cover pay, incentives, moving allowances and
funds set aside for military retirement.  Obama exempted military pay and benefits from this year’s
cuts, which took effect in March. The Pentagon is being required
to cut $37 billion by the end of the current fiscal year on
Sept. 30.  Of that, $20 billion of which will come from operations and
maintenance accounts and $17 billion from weapons research and
procurement. The Pentagon faces $52 billion more in
sequestration reductions for fiscal 2014.  Hagel warned last week that the Pentagon will be forced to
choose between a decade-long “modernization holiday” and a
“much smaller” force if the military has to absorb cuts adding
up to more than $500 billion over a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
