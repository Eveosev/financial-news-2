Huaxia Bank Co. (600015) , partly owned by
Deutsche Bank AG, said first-half profit rose 20 percent as
lending and fee income growth offset a jump in bad-loan charges.  Net income  climbed to 7.3 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in
the six months ended June 30, from 6.1 billion yuan a year
earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a statement to the
 Shanghai  Stock Exchange today. The gain slowed from a 25 percent
increase in the first quarter.  Huaxia Bank, which kicks off Chinese lenders’ earnings
season, is among smaller institutions most hurt by the country’s
cash squeeze at the end of June. Their reliance on interbank and
short-term wealth management products for funding is eroding
loan margins and financial strength, according to Moody’s
Investors Service.  The  one-day repurchase rate  touched an unprecedented 13.91
percent on June 20 after Premier Li Keqiang signaled a
determination to stamp out speculation funded by cheap money,
saying banks must make better use of  existing credit  and step up
efforts to contain financial risks.  Huaxia Bank had 773 billion  yuan  of loans outstanding at
the end of June, an increase of 7 percent from the beginning of
the year. Its net interest margin, or a measure of lending
profitability, fell to 2.7 percent in the first half from 2.80
percent a year earlier.  Net interest income rose 11 percent to 19 billion yuan in
the first half, while the lender’s net fee and commission income
from products such as credit cards and wealth management
products increased 49 percent to 3 billion yuan.  The bank had 7.1 billion yuan of non-performing loans as of
June 30, compared with 6.3 billion yuan at the beginning of the
year, according to the statement.  Shares of Huaxia Bank have lost 16 percent in Shanghai this
year, compared with a 9.9 percent decline in the benchmark
 Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)   Deutsche Bank owned 17.5 percent of Huaxia Bank as of June
30, according to today’s statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
