Brent crude  declined for a fifth day
as exports from the North Sea rebounded to a seven-month high,
while a pipeline in Yemen resumed flows after an attack.  Brent dropped as much as 0.7 percent, erasing an earlier
gain of 0.4 percent. Daily exports of North Sea Brent, Forties,
Oseberg and Ekofisk grades, which make up the Dated Brent
benchmark, will jump to 900,000 barrels a day in September,
revised loading programs obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.
Yemen’s Marib crude began flowing today through a pipeline after
repairs were made to the line following sabotage by local
tribesmen on Aug. 4, the official Saba news agency reported.  “A slight easing of supply concerns with few developments
on the geopolitical front” is weighing on prices, said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London.  Brent for September settlement slipped as much as 72 cents
to $106.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark’s premium to West Texas
Intermediate strengthened earlier to as much as $3.31, the
widest gap on an intraday basis since July 31.  WTI for September delivery was at $103.82 a barrel, down 55
cents in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:37 p.m. London time. The volume of all futures traded was 6
percent above the 100-day average. The contract decreased 93
cents to $104.37 yesterday, the lowest since July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
