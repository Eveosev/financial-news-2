Former Guinea Bissau Prime Minister
Carlos Gomes Jr., who was ousted in a 2012 coup, said he will
return to the West African nation as soon as next month to run
for president in this year’s election.  “I have decided to return to my country,” Gomes told
reporters in Lisbon today, where he has been in exile. “I am
the No. 1 candidate.”  The military ousted Gomes and President Raimundo Pereira in
April of last year ahead of elections, leading to economic and
political sanctions for the nation of 1.6 million people. The
military appointed Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo as interim president.
Elections are scheduled for Nov. 24, Manecas Santos, a spokesman
for Gomes’ PAIGC party, said on June 28.  “I’m waiting for the necessary conditions for our
return,” Gomes said.  Since independence from  Portugal  in 1974, Guinea Bissau has
faced three coups, including the 2009 assassination of the
president. The country is  Africa ’s second-biggest cashew-nut
grower and serves as a transit point for trafficking of cocaine
from to  Europe  from  Latin America , according to the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
