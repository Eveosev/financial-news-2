Copper climbed to the highest level
in seven weeks after trade data in  China , the biggest user,
exceeded analyst estimates. Aluminum, nickel, zinc and lead rose.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose as much as 2 percent to $7,146 a metric ton, the
highest since June 17, and was at $7,141.25 a ton at 11:29 a.m.
in  Shanghai . Metal for delivery in November on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange rose 2.8 percent to 51,490  yuan  ($8,417) a ton.  Shipments abroad rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, the
General Administration of Customs said in Beijing today. That
compares with the median estimate for a 2 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey and June’s 3.1 percent drop. Imports
advanced 10.9 percent, leaving a trade  surplus  of $17.8 billion.
The government signaled last month that it will defend its 7.5
percent economic-growth target for the year after expansion
slowed for a second quarter.  “Copper was supported by a positive demand outlook as
China has pledged to stabilize growth and the  U.S. economy 
recovering,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO
Futures Co.  China’s statistics bureau will release inflation and
industrial production data tomorrow. Inflation probably
quickened to 2.8 percent last month from 2.7 percent in June,
while growth in industrial output may remain unchanged at 8.9
percent from a month earlier, according to Bloomberg surveys.  On the LME, tin was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
