German stocks  erased their advance as
 Adidas AG (ADS)  dropped after posting net income that fell short of
analysts’ estimates.  Adidas slipped 1.9 percent after the world’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker lowered its forecasts for 2013, citing slow
sales in Europe and unfavorable  currency markets .  Commerzbank AG (CBK) 
jumped 5.8 percent after Germany’s second-biggest bank reported
second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.
Deutsche Telekom added 4.1 percent after second-quarter sales
beat forecasts.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  decreased 0.1 percent to 8,254.35 at 9:35
a.m. in Frankfurt, erasing an advance of as much as 0.3 percent.
The equity benchmark has fallen for five consecutive days, its
longest losing streak since April. The broader HDAX Index
slipped less than 0.1 percent today.  China’s exports  and imports rebounded in July more than
estimated. Exports rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, the
General Administration of Customs said in Beijing today. That
compared with the median estimate for a 2 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey and June’s 3.1 percent drop. Imports rose
10.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
