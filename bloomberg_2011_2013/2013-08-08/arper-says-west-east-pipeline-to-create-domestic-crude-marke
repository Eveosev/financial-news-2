Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said a pipeline proposed by  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  to carry
crude to the east coast would enhance domestic demand for
Alberta’s crude.  “This has the ability, this entire pan-Canadian pipeline,
to create jobs, both construction jobs and permanent jobs, in
the energy industry that will benefit the entire country and
ultimately create a large domestic market from which Canadians
will benefit,” Harper said at an event today in Saint John, New
Brunswick.  TransCanada last week said it will go ahead with the
project, known as Energy East. Harper has encouraged the U.S. to
approve TransCanada’s Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry
crude from the oil sands to the Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
