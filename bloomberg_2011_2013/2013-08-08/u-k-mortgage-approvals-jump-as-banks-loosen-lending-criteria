U.K. mortgage approvals climbed 21
percent in July from a year earlier as bank lending to
homebuyers with smaller deposits soared, e.surv Ltd. said.  The total of 56,475 was the most for July since 2007, the
unit of London-based  LSL Property Services Plc (LSL)  said in a report
today. Loans to buyers with a deposit of 15 percent or less,
known as high loan-to-value borrowers, increased 56 percent to
6,946.  “Confidence is seeping back into the mortgage market,”
said Richard Sexton, director of e.surv, a chartered surveyor.
“High-LTV borrowers are enjoying more success in qualifying for
house-purchase loans as banks begin to ease lending criteria.”  A pickup in demand for homes is reviving Britain’s property
market. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has
introduced plans to increase mortgage availability and the  Bank
of England  has implemented a program to boost credit after the
financial crisis prompted banks to rein in lending and demand
higher down payments.  Most high loan-to-value lending took place in the north of
 England . About 24 percent of the total went to borrowers in the
northeast and Cumbria with 23 percent granted in the northwest
and 20 percent in Yorkshire.  “The north-south divide is finally narrowing,” Sexton
said. “It’s getting easier for first-time buyers nationwide to
access the mortgages available to them, as banks extend more
lending to high LTV borrowers across the country.”  Approvals overall fell 2 percent in July from June, e.surv
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
