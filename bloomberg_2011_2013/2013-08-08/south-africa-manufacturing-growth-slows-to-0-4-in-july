(Corrects month in headline.)  South African  manufacturing  growth
unexpectedly slowed in June, undermining the outlook for
Africa’s biggest economy.  Factory output expanded 0.4 percent, down from a revised
2.1 percent in May, Statistics  South Africa  said on its website.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists was
4.3 percent. Output  contracted  3 percent in the month.  “There was a little bubble up of output during the second
quarter that was not the underlying trend” for growth, Peter Attard Montalto, an economist at Nomura Plc in  London , said by
phone. “We see South Africa at below potential growth into the
second half of 2015.”  The South African Reserve Bank has kept its benchmark
 interest rate  at 5 percent for a year as inflation pressures
prevent it from cutting borrowing costs to stimulate the
economy, which expanded last quarter at the slowest pace since a
2009 recession. Manufacturing makes up about 15 percent of the
economy.  The rand rose 1.1 percent to 9.8625 per dollar at 1:06 p.m.
in Johannesburg. The yield on the benchmark rand bond due in
2026 dropped 7 basis points to 8.135 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
