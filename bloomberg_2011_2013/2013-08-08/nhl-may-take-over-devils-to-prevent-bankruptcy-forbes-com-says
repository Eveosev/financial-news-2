The  National Hockey League  may take
over the  New Jersey Devils  next month unless a buyer emerges for
the team, Forbes reported.  The Devils have $230 million in debt and team owner Jeff Vanderbeek missed the first payment on a restructured bank loan,
the magazine  reported on its website , citing multiple people it
didn’t identify.  NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said that he hadn’t seen the
Forbes report “but if the suggestion is we’re going to take
over the Devils, which is what I’ve heard the report says, it’s
not accurate.”  Robert Sommer, president of Rock Entertainment Management,
which is involved with the Devils and Prudential Center in
Newark New Jersey, declined to comment on the Forbes report.  The Record of Bergen County reported that two other groups,
one headed by attorney Andrew Barroway, the other by  Josh Harris , the owner of basketball’s Philadelphia 76ers, were
trying to buy the Devils.  The league doesn’t want the team to file for bankruptcy,
like the  Phoenix Coyotes  did in 2009, Forbes said. The Coyotes
were sold for $170 million after renegotiating their lease with
Glendale, Arizona.  The NHL would instead operate the Devils while seeking a
buyer, Forbes said. The Devils owe the league about $25 million
and their payroll for the 2013-14 season is projected at about
$55 million.  Bettman spoke today at Yankee Stadium to promote an outdoor
series of hockey games to be played in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
