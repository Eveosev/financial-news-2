NITC,  Iran ’s biggest tanker company,
increased the capacity of its supertanker fleet by 23 percent
this year amid sanctions related to the nation’s nuclear program
that bar most of the world’s ships from carrying Iranian crude,
according to IHS Maritime.  The Tehran-based company added seven new very large crude
carriers, each able to transport 2 million barrels of oil,
according to data from the Coulsdon, England-based research
company, which provides information for the  United Nations ’
shipping agency. NITC has 37 supertankers and its entire fleet
can hold about 86 million barrels of oil, equal to 65 days of
the nation’s exports, IHS data show.  European Union sanctions that started in July 2012 prevent
most non-Iranian tankers from hauling the country’s crude
because almost all ships are insured under the 28-nation bloc’s
laws. The U.S. and EU say  Iran’s nuclear program  is aimed at
producing weapons while the government in Tehran says it is for
civilian purposes.  Iran didn’t add to its fleet of smaller Suezmax or Aframax
vessels this year, according to IHS data. Ali-Akbar Safaei,
NITC’s chairman, wasn’t available for comment, according to a
person answering the phone at the company’s offices in Tehran
yesterday. Later calls weren’t answered and NITC’s website
doesn’t give an e-mail address.  Iran’s exports fell 48 percent to 66 million metric tons
last year, reducing revenue by 38 percent to $52.7 billion,
according to data from the International Trade Centre, an agency
of the United Nations and the  World Trade Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
