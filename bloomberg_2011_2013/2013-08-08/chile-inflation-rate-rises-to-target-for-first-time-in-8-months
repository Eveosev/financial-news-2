Chileâ€™s annual  inflation  rate rose
within its target range in July for the first time in eight
months as analysts predict policy makers may cut the benchmark
interest rate as early as next week to boost economic growth.  Consumer prices climbed 2.2 percent from a year earlier,
the fastest pace since October. Prices gained 0.3 percent in the
month, matching the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 12
analysts. The bank targets inflation of 3 percent plus or minus
1 percentage point.  A pickup in inflation in the past two months come as
slowing economic growth fuels speculation the central bank will
cut the benchmark interest rate this year. Four of seven
economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect policy makers to reduce
the key rate by quarter point to 4.75 percent next week, the
first cut in 19 months. Traders surveyed by the central bank
last month saw the benchmark rate at 4.5 percent in six months.  The central bank lowered in July its forecast for growth
this year and expect the economy to grow from 4 percent to 5
percent. Previously it predicted growth of at least 4.5 percent.  The consolidation of recent economic trends could prompt a
rate change in the next few months, central bank President
Rodrigo Vergara said on July 25.  Core  prices (CNPINSMO) , which exclude fuel and produce, rose 0.1
percent last month, as predicted by analysts polled by
Bloomberg.  Consumer prices gained 1.5 percent last year, compared with
4.4 percent in 2011, falling short of the 2 percent to 4 percent
target band for the first time since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
