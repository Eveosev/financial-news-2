Taiwan’s five-year bonds snapped a
two-day loss after export figures missed estimates, adding to
concern the economy is slowing. The local dollar strengthened.  Overseas shipments, which account for more than 60 percent
of the island’s gross domestic product, rose 1.6 percent in July
from a year earlier, official data showed yesterday. That was
less than the 4.9 percent increase forecast by economists in a
Bloomberg survey and an 8.6 percent advance the previous month.
Global funds sold $536 million more Taiwanese shares than they
bought in the last three days, cutting net purchases this year
to $2.3 billion, according to the stock exchange.  “The exports data wasn’t good and some traders are trying
to push down yields,” said Sam Chang, a fixed-income trader at
Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “But the long-term trend of
yields rising hasn’t changed.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent government notes due January
2018 fell one basis point to 1.116 percent as of 10:18 a.m. in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  Taiwanese bonds have lost 3.2 percent this year, the
second-worst performance after  Indonesia  among 10 Asian debt
indexes compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. The government lowered
its official growth forecast for this year to 2.4 percent in May
from 3.59 percent previously.  The central bank will sell NT$10 billion ($334 million) of
two-year negotiable certificates of deposit tomorrow, the first
such offering since 2003.  Currency, Volatility  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.3 percent to NT$29.936
against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The
currency was little changed four minutes before the 4 p.m. close
yesterday and ended 0.1 percent weaker.  The central bank has sold the island’s dollar in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.929 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, was little changed at 3.44
percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
