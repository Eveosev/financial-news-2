Coca-Cola HBC AG (CCH) , the bottler that
switched its listing from  Athens  to London, said second-quarter
sales fell 2 percent as a volume gain in  emerging markets  failed
to offset declines in countries including Greece and Austria.  Revenue fell to 1.95 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in the
three months ended June 28, the company said today in a
statement. That missed the prediction of Mike Gibbs, an analyst
at JPMorgan Cazenove who estimated sales of 1.989 billion euros.  Volume gained 2 percent in emerging markets, Coca-Cola HBC
said, while levels dropped 6 percent in so-called established
economies and 3 percent in developing markets. The company buys
concentrate from Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. and sells the
products in  Europe .  Coca-Cola HBC said it will start a “progressive” dividend
policy in 2014 that targets an annual payout with a ratio to
profit after tax of 35 percent to 45 percent. The company, which
switched its primary stock listing in April, paid a dividend of
34 euros cents a share in July worth 124.7 million euros, or
about 43 percent.  Coca-Cola HBC maintained volume share in sparkling drinks
“in the majority of our markets” in the first half, the
company said.  The bottler operates in countries with lower per-capita
consumption of sparkling drinks than the rest of the eurozone,
which will help it boost volume growth, Chief Executive Officer
Dimitris Lois said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
