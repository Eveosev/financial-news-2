 The Irish Sun, part of  Rupert
Murdoch ’s News International Corp., has stopped showing pictures
of topless women on page 3 of the paper, to “reflect the
cultural differences in Ireland.”  “Page 3 is a hugely popular pillar of the Sun in the
U.K.,” editor Paul Clarkson said in an e-mailed statement. “In
the Irish Sun we strive to share the qualities that make the
newspaper great in print and digital, but we also strive to
cater for our own readers’ needs and reflect the cultural
differences in Ireland.”  Campaigners in the U.K. have been pressing Murdoch to drop
the pictures. Following a Twitter barrage, the News Corp.
chairman tweeted that he was considering replacing the 42-year-old fixture with shots of “glamorous fashionistas” -- who would
probably keep their clothes on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
