Treasury’s sale of $72 billion in
notes and bonds this week drew above-average demand from a
category that includes foreign investors, damping concern the
overseas allure of U.S. assets is weakening.  At yesterday’s sale of $16 billion of 30-year bonds,
 indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 37.2 percent for the past 10 sales. Primary
dealers purchased 42.7 percent at the auction, the lowest since
November and below the 48.5 percent average of the past 10 sales
of the securities. The longer-term securities were sold at
auction yields at almost two-year highs.  “The indirect demand has been pretty good this month, a
part of it has to do with the back-up in yields,” said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
 New York , one of the 21 primary dealers that are obligated to
bid at the auctions.  The yield on 30-year bonds  fell  one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.67 percent yesterday in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.875 percent
security due May 2043 added 6/32, or $1.88 per $1,000 face
amount, to 85 20/32.  Benchmark Securities  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell one basis point to
2.59 percent, after touching the lowest level since July 31. The
yield reached 2.75 percent on July 8, triggered by Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who rattled markets in May and
June by outlining a plan to end the central bank’s unprecedented
asset purchases.  Investors in U.S. government securities have lost 2.6
percent this year, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index (BUSY)  as of yesterday.  U.S. debt  gained 2 percent in 2012.  The 30-year bonds were sold at a yield of 3.652 percent,
just below the 3.66 percent at the July sale of the debt, which
was the highest yield in almost two years. The $24 billion in
10-year notes sold the previous day drew a yield of 2.620
percent, just below the 2.67 percent yield at the July 10 sale,
the highest level since July 2011.  At the Aug. 7 sale of 10-year notes,  indirect bidders 
purchased 46.3 percent of the debt, compared with an average of
37.1 percent for the past 10 sales. At an auction of three-year
securities the previous day,  indirect bidders  bought 41.4
percent of the notes, the most since August 2011 and above the
average of 26.1 percent at the past 10 sales.  Demand Trend  Demand comes amid data indicating foreign investors were
adding Treasuries at the slowest pace since 2006 as  holdings  by
non-U.S. investors rose 1.9 percent through May, down from 5.2
percent a year ago, data released in July by the Treasury
showed.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 17.1 percent of
the securities at the 30-year bond auction, compared with an
average of 14.3 percent for the past 10 auctions.  “The street picked up 42.7 percent; from that perspective,
it’s a good auction,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in
New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Amid higher demand from indirect and direct bidders,
overall demand at yesterday’s auction dropped, reflecting a 2013
trend. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 2.11, the
least since August 2011 and compared with an average of 2.55 for
the past 10 sales.  Bid Totals  Investors have bid $2.90 for each dollar of the $1.329
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this
year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Thirty-year bonds have lost 11.9 percent this year,
compared with a decline of 2.7 percent by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 2.5 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2
percent.  This week’s sales raise $2.4 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $69.6 billion,
according to the  U.S. Treasury .  To contact the reporters on this story:
