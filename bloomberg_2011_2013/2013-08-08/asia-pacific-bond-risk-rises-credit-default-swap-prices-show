The cost of insuring bonds in the
Asia-Pacific region from non-payment increased for a second day,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 1 basis point to 145.5 basis points
as of 9:09 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The benchmark is on course for its highest close
since Aug. 2, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1 basis point to
120 as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney, according to National Australia
Bank Ltd. The gauge is also headed for its second daily increase
to its highest level this week, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed 0.5 of a basis point
to 98 as of 10:03 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
measure is also poised for its second daily increase to the
highest since Aug. 1, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
