U.K. 10-year bonds rose for the first
time in seven days as Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  said
the country is “in the very early stages” of its economic
recovery, signaling  interest rates  will stay lower for longer.  The gains pushed benchmark yields down from near the
highest level in six weeks. The U.K. economy was starting to
rebound “from the weakest period on record,” Carney said on
BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program. The pound was little changed
versus the dollar after climbing yesterday to the highest level
in seven weeks. The central bank pledged yesterday to keep
policy accommodative until the jobless rate falls to 7 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield slipped four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.44 percent at 9:09 a.m. London
time. The rate rose to 2.56 percent yesterday, the highest since
June 25. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 gained
0.285, or 2.85 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,550) face amount, to
94.35.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 1.3 billion
pounds of inflation-linked bonds due in 2034 today. The U.K.
last sold 20-year inflation-linked securities in September at an
average real yield of 0.126 percent.  Gilts have lost investors 3.4 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
dropped 2.6 percent and German bonds declined 1.4 percent.  The pound traded at $1.5496 after rising to $1.5531
yesterday, the most since June 21. Sterling was at 86.14 pence
per euro after reaching 85.79 pence yesterday, the strongest
since July 10.  The pound has risen 1.6 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro strengthened 3.6
percent and the dollar gained 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
