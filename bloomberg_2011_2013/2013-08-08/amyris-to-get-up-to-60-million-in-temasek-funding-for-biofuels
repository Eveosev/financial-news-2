Amyris Inc. (AMRS) , the biotechnology
company part-owned by Total SA, will sell as much as $60 million
in convertible notes to Temasek Holdings Pte.  Temasek will buy $35 million of notes in an initial tranche
and later may purchase an additional $25 million of notes,
Emeryville, California-based Amyris said today in a statement.
The first tranche is expected to close next month. The second
may be issued at the company’s discretion within two years of
the agreement, depending on meeting certain milestones at a
Brazil production site.  Amyris reported a second-quarter net loss of $38.9 million,
or 51 cents a share, compared with $46.8 million, or 81 cents,
from a year earlier, according to a statement today. Five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a quarterly loss of
43 cents a share.  Amyris uses genetically modified microorganisms to convert
plant-sugars into farnesene, a hydrocarbon that can be processed
into fuels or specialty chemicals. Total,  France ’s largest oil
producer, owns 18 percent of the company, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg. Temasek is the second-largest
shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
