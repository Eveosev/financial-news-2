Thailand ’s baht rose the most in four
weeks after data showed exports and imports rebounded in  China ,
the Southeast Asian nation’s largest overseas market. Government
bonds advanced for a fourth day.  The currency sank to a one-month low yesterday as
parliament began debating an amnesty bill for political
prisoners and those facing charges related to government
protests after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was
toppled in a 2006 coup. China’s overseas sales grew 5.1 percent
in July, after a 3.1 percent drop the previous month, and
imports climbed 11 percent, the government reported today.  “With lingering concern about China’s slowdown, people in
the market reacted quickly to the strong data today,” said  Koji Fukaya , chief executive officer and foreign-exchange strategist
at FPG Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Domestically, there’s
political concern in Thailand and investors may want to stay on
the sidelines for a while.”  The baht advanced 0.4 percent, the most since July 11, to
31.32 per dollar as of 11:07 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 31.49 yesterday, the weakest
level since July 8. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 6.28 percent.  China accounted for 11 percent of Thailand’s exports in the
first half of 2013, official data show. Bank of Thailand
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on July 29 that total
shipments during the period were lower than expected and there
should be an improvement in the July-December period.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign bonds due June
2023 declined three basis points to a one-week low of 3.94
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
