Treasuries rose for a second day, the
first back-to-back gain in almost two weeks, after yields near
the highest level in two years helped attract demand at a 10-year note sale yesterday.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $16 billion of 30-year bonds
today. Demand for Treasuries was supported before data
economists said will show  claims  for jobless benefits increased,
adding to signs of weakness in the U.S. economic recovery that
may delay Federal Reserve policy makers’ plans to reduce
stimulus. U.S. employers hired fewer workers in July than
economists forecast, according to Labor Department data
published last week.  “There’s momentum from the good takedown of the auction
and also technical support,” said  Michael Leister , a senior
fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  London . “If you
take a medium-term view, yields are rather at the upper end of
the range, and at the same time after the payrolls the early
September tapering speculation has cooled down somewhat. This
combination is a key driver for demand.”  The yield on the benchmark  10-year note  sold yesterday fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.60 percent at
6:21 a.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2.5 percent security due August 2023 rose 1/8, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 1/8.  The $24 billion auction yesterday drew a  yield  of 2.62
percent, down from 2.67 percent at the previous offering last
month, which was the most since July 2011. The 10-year auction
yield was lower than the rate of 2.635 percent projected by a
Bloomberg News survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers,
companies obligated to submit bids at the debt sales.  Bond Auction  The 30-year bonds being sold today yielded 3.65 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 3.66 percent at a previous
auction of similar-maturity debt on July 11. That was the
highest in almost two years. Investors bid for 2.26 times the
amount of debt offered last month, the least since August 2011.  Mizuho Asset Management Co. and Fukoku Mutual Life
Insurance Co. are both optimistic on Treasuries.  A reduction in the Fed’s $85 billion in monthly debt
purchases, known as quantitative easing, will end up supporting
U.S. government securities, according to Mizuho Asset
Management, which is part of  Japan ’s third-biggest bank as
measured by market value.  “The liquidity provided by the Fed mainly went to high-risk assets,” said Yusuke Ito, who helps oversee the equivalent
of $33.1 billion for the company in  Tokyo . “I want QE tapering
to start soon because liquidity will go to safer assets like
Treasuries.”  Fed Tapering  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on June 19 that the U.S.
central bank may start to reduce bond purchases this year and
end them entirely in 2014 if economic growth is in line with
central-bank projections.  Claims for jobless benefits rose from the lowest level in
more than five years last week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey before today’s Labor Department report. Applications for
unemployment insurance payments increased to 335,000 from
326,000 in the previous week, economists predict.  The increase in yields is making Treasuries more appealing,
Yoshiyuki Suzuki, head of fixed income at Fukoku Mutual in
Tokyo, said yesterday. The insurer has the equivalent of $58.5
billion in assets. The 10-year yield has climbed from a record-low 1.379 percent in July 2012.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 46.3 percent of the 10-year notes sold
yesterday, up from 38.6 percent on July 10. At an auction of
three-year debt on Aug. 6,  indirect bidders  bought 41.4 percent,
the most since August 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
