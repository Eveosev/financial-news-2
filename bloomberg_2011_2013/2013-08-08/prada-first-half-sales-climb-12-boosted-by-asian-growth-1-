Prada SpA (1913) , an Italian maker of $1,870
handbags, reported a 12 percent increase in first-half sales
boosted by growth in Asia.  Revenue advanced to 1.73 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in
the six months through July, Milan-based Prada said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted 1.75 billion euros according to
the average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Same-store
sales rose 7 percent.  The luxury goods industry is rebounding after a stuttering
start to the year with  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and
Gucci-owner  Kering (KER)  SA last month reporting accelerating sales.
Prada, which aims to grow without making acquisitions, said in
June it is confident of high single-digit percentage growth in
like-for-like sales this year as it opens as many as 80 stores.
It had 491 directly-operated shops at the end of July.  “Overall, a slightly disappointing set of figures,”
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Allegra Perry said, citing
decelerating second-quarter sales. However, we “believe this
reflects self-help measures in wholesale.” She recommends
buying the shares.  Prada said it reduced the number of its third-party
distributors by more than 100.  Sales gained 18 percent in the Asia Pacific region, 16
percent in  Japan  and 14 percent in the Americas. European sales
grew 5.7 percent.  Prada’s earnings were released after the close of the Hong
Kong stock market, where its shares trade. The stock fell 1.5
percent to HK$71.40 today, giving the owner of brands including
Miu Miu, Church and Car Shoe a market value of HK$182.7 billion
($23.6 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
