in July, while imports advanced 10.9 percent.  “The market is focused on policy reforms these days rather
than economic data,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager 
at Dragon Life Insurance Co., which oversees $3.3 billion in
assets. “Unless the economic data far exceed or trail
estimates, the market won’t respond too much.”  The CSI 300 Index slipped 0.2 percent to 2,276.78. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.6 percent. The Bloomberg

slowed for a second quarter. China last month announced measures
to support the economy such as ordering companies in 19
industries to curb overcapacity as well as tax cuts for small
firms and aid to exporters.  China ’s shipments abroad compared with the median estimate

analysts and June’s 3.1 percent drop. The increase in imports
compares with the median estimate for a 1 percent gain and a 0.7
percent decline in June.  Rare Earth  “We expect better trade activity to only partially offset
weak domestic demand due to tighter credit conditions” in the
second half, and growth will keep decelerating over the next few
quarters, Ding Shuang, economist at Citigroup Inc., wrote in a
note.  Shenzhen Energy tumbled 3.5 percent to 5.48 yuan, its
biggest loss since June 24. The company denied yesterday’s
