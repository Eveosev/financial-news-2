Matt Harvey pitched nine innings for
his first career shutout as the  New York Mets  defeated the
Colorado Rockies 5-0.  Harvey (9-3) gave up four hits and struck out six in his
first complete Major League Baseball game. He threw 106 pitches,
including 78 strikes, at Citi Field in  New York .  Harvey got hit in the knee with a line drive off Charlie
Blackmon’s bat in the ninth inning, which threatened to end his
night. He tried to wave off manager Terry Collins and a trainer
and then threw a practice ball before getting the final out.  “I don’t like when they come on the field at all so I was
trying to shoo them off as quick as I could,” Harvey told
reporters. “I felt fine. I wanted to finish the game.”  Harvey, who had an ice pack on his knee after the game,
played down the hit, while Collins saw a potentially serious
injury.  “He must have thought I was blind if he thought I thought
that glanced off that his leg,” Collins said. “I knew it hit
him good.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
