World  food prices  fell for a third
month in July to the lowest level in a year, led by sliding
grain prices on an outlook for increased corn production, the
UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization reported.  An index of 55 food items tracked by the FAO fell to 205.9
points from a revised 210.1 in June, the Rome-based United
Nations agency wrote in an online report today. The gauge, which
reached a record 237.9 points in February 2011, fell to its
lowest level since June 2012.  The world’s food-import bill is expected to remain stable
this year at $1.094 trillion as lower spending on sugar and
cooking oils makes up for rising costs of dairy, fish and meat,
the FAO predicted June 13. Since then, corn futures in  Chicago 
slumped 14 percent, falling to the lowest since October 2010
this week.  “The decline in July, which marked the third consecutive
monthly drop, was largely driven by lower international prices
for grains, soy and palm oil,” the FAO wrote.  The FAO’s grain price index fell 3.7 percent to 227.7
points in July from 236.5 in June.  “The sharp decline mostly reflected falling maize prices
as favorable weather boosted hopes of a significant production
increase in several leading maize-producing countries,” the FAO
wrote, using another name for corn. “Wheat prices also rose but
the strong pace of exports limited the decline.”  The gauge for cooking oils and fats dropped 3.3 percent to
191.2 points, sliding to the lowest level since July 2010. The
dairy price index slid 1.1 percent last month to 236.3, falling
for a third month after in April rising to the highest since
December 2007 as drought cut supplies in  New Zealand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
