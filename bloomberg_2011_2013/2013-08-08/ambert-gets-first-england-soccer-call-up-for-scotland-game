Rickie Lambert was named to the
England soccer squad for next week’s exhibition match against
Scotland, giving the 31-year-old Southampton striker his first
national team call-up.  Lambert, who scored 15 Premier League goals last season,
joins  Wayne Rooney , Jermain Defoe and Danny Welbeck among the
forwards for the Aug. 14 game at Wembley Stadium in London.
Rooney hasn’t played for Manchester United this preseason
because of hamstring and shoulder injuries.  United’s new signing Wilfried Zaha is also named, following
his England debut as a substitute against Sweden last November.  Captain  Steven Gerrard  and Jack Wilshere were also included
after both missed the past two international games with
injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
