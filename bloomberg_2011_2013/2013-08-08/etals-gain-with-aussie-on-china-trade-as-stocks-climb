U.S. stocks halted a three-day slide
while metals and the currencies of  Australia , South Africa and
Brazil rallied as data on  China ’s trade and American jobless
claims bolstered optimism in the global economy.  The S&P 500 rose 0.4 percent to 1,697.48 as of 4 p.m. in
New York, paring gains after briefly topping 1,700, while
Brazil’s  Ibovespa (IBOV)  jumped 3.1 percent for its biggest gain since
March. Treasury 10-year yields fell one basis point to 2.59
percent. Copper and zinc added more than 2.5 percent as gold
futures jumped 1.9 percent to $1,309.90 an ounce. The U.S.
dollar fell versus 14 of 16 major peers, with the rand, Aussie
and Brazilian real strengthening more than 1 percent.  China’s exports jumped 5.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, more than double the pace forecast in a survey of
economists. Investors dissected the latest economic reports to
gauge prospects for Federal Reserve stimulus. The number of
workers applying for U.S. jobless benefits over the past month
declined to the lowest level since before the last recession,
after Fed Bank of Cleveland President Sandra Pianalto said
yesterday a reduction of bond purchases may be warranted if the
labor market continues to improve.  “We’re making baby steps toward a full economic
recovery,” Jim King, president and chief investment officer who
helps oversee about $2.7 billion at Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based National Penn Investors Trust Co., said by phone. “The
market often wants things to happen today. In absence of that,
we seem to be trapped in this fairly narrow trading range. In
order to really bust through higher levels, the market is
looking for even more positive news than we’ve seen come out.”  1,700 Watch  The S&P 500 has rallied 19 percent this year and closed at
a record 1,709.67 on Aug. 2. The gauge topped 1,700 for the
first time on Aug. 1, after climbing within two points of that
level for three times in the previous week only to retreat by
the close of trading. It briefly rose above 1,700 today before
paring gains and closing below.  Stocks also advanced this year as corporate earnings
surpassed estimates. Earnings  beat estimates  at 72 percent of
the 444 companies in the S&P 500 that have reported quarterly
results so far this period, while 56 percent have beaten sales
projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, fell 1.9 percent today to 12.73 today. The equity
volatility gauge reached its 2013 peak in June and has since
dropped 39 percent.  Market Leaders  Gauges of commodity, consumer, energy and industrial shares
climbed at least 0.4 percent to lead gains among nine of the 10
 main industry groups  in the S&P 500 today, with only telephone
stocks dropping.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. and Newmont Mining Corp.
gained at least 8.7 percent as metals rallied.  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) 
surged 14 percent after reporting second-quarter results that
surpassed analysts’ estimates. JPMorgan Chase & Co. dropped 0.9
percent after saying it’s under federal criminal investigation
for practices tied to sales of mortgage-backed bonds.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  rose 2.6 percent for the biggest gain in
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The maker of the Windows
operating system was raised to overweight from equalweight by
Evercore Partners, which said the company has an attractive
valuation and may increase its dividend in September. Microsoft
trades for about 11.8 times estimated earnings and is forecast
to increase its quarterly dividend to 26 cents a share in
September from 23 cents, according to Bloomberg  projections .  Initial  claims for U.S. unemployment benefits  rose to
333,000 last week from a revised 328,000 in the previous period,
Labor Department data showed. The number of claims in the four
weeks ended Aug. 3 declined to 335,500 on average, the least
since November 2007, the report showed.  Fed Speculation  Improvement in the job market has helped fuel speculation
the Fed will reduce bond purchases, triggering swings in stocks
and bonds. The S&P 500 slumped as much as 5.8 percent from May
21 to June 24 after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
central bank could start tapering stimulus if the labor market
continues to improve. The benchmark index has rebounded 8
percent since. Ten-year Treasury yields jumped from their 2013
low of 1.63 percent on May 2 to as high as 2.74 percent on July
5.  Fed Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher told  Germany ’s
Handelsblatt newspaper in an interview today that the central
banks should start reducing bond purchases in September if
“economic data doesn’t significantly deteriorate.” Fisher, one
of the most vocal critics of quantitative easing, said on Aug. 5
the Fed is closer to slowing its stimulus.  European Markets  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.4 percent as results at
Deutsche Telekom AG and Commerzbank AG beat estimates. The
regional benchmark index snapped a two-day decline, with trading
volumes 3.7 percent above the 30-day average. Deutsche Telekom,
Germany’s largest phone company, climbed 7.7 percent after
second-quarter sales beat estimates.  Commerzbank, the German bank forced into a state bailout,
surged 16 percent after reporting net income that exceeded
projections. Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food company, slid
2.2 percent after reporting the slowest first-half revenue
growth in four years.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index rebounded from a four-week
low, rising 0.9 percent. The gauge of developing nations’
equities has lost more than 10 percent this year, trailing the
S&P 500’s performance by almost 30 percentage points. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in
Hong Kong added 0.4 percent. China’s imports gained 10.9
percent, more than the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
1 percent growth and leaving a trade surplus of $17.8 billion.  India ’s Sensex Index jumped 0.7 percent and the rupee
strengthened 0.7 percent. Benchmark gauges in  Poland ,  Hungary ,
the Czech Republic and  Thailand  rose at least 1.2 percent.  Yen, Dollar  The yen was 0.4 percent lower against the dollar, erasing
earlier gains of more than 0.5 percent triggered after the Bank
of  Japan  refrained from boosting stimulus measures that tend to
weaken a currency. Japan’s currency was at 96.58 per dollar
after appreciating to 95.81, the strongest since June.  The Bloomberg Dollar Index fell 0.4 percent as it declined
for a fifth day, the longest streak of losses since April. The
euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.3386.  The gain in Treasuries pushed 30-year bond yields down one
basis point to 3.67 percent as a $16 billion auction of the
securities drew above-average demand from an investor class that
includes foreign central banks. U.S. benchmark 10-year notes
advanced for a second day as the third and final coupon security
sale this week found demand with auction yields at almost the
highest level in two years.  Copper, Cattle  Copper climbed as much as 3 percent to $7,215 a metric ton
in  London , the highest level since June, before paring gains and
trading at $7,185.  Live cattle rose 1.9 percent after Tyson Foods Inc., the
top U.S. meat processor, said it plans to stop buying animals
fed with a supplement made by Merck & Co. after discovering lame
livestock at factories.  Corn added 0.3 percent to $4.5975 a bushel, halting a five-day slump. U.S. farmers are poised to reap their biggest-ever
corn crop, expanding global stockpiles to the most in 13 years
and spurring hedge funds and other speculators to make record
bets that prices will keep dropping.  The harvest in the largest grower will jump 30 percent to
14.036 billion bushels (356.5 million metric tons), the average
of 27 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. That’s 53
million bushels more than they expected a month ago and 86
million above the government’s July forecast. Record crops from
the U.S. to  Brazil  to Ukraine will expand world inventories by
23 percent to 152.36 million tons in a year, according to the
average of 12 predictions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
