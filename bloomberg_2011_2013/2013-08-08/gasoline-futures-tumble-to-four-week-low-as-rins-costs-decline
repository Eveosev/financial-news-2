Gasoline fell for a sixth day, the
longest slide in four months, as the cost of renewable fuel
credits sank, easing concern that higher costs to blend ethanol
would curb fuel production.  Futures slipped as 2013 Renewable Identification Numbers,
or RINs, dropped a fifth straight day. RINs were going for 74
cents yesterday, the lowest since April 29, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Gasoline supplies  are the highest seasonally in
data going back to 1990, according to Energy Information
Administration data.  “As RINs costs go down, that will be bearish for gasoline,
along with the relatively high gasoline inventories,” said
 Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in
New York. “I’m hearing that RINs were down under 60 cents this
morning.”  Gasoline for September delivery fell 3.1 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.8401 a gallon at 10:19 a.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, after touching $2.8346, the lowest intraday
level since July 5. The volume of trade was 16 percent above the
100-day average.  Futures have dropped every day this month, losing 6.7
percent. Gasoline is the worst performer in August in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities, after being the
index’s top gainer in July.  Refiners must buy the credits in lieu of blending ethanol
into gasoline to meet federal rules. The Environmental
Protection Agency gave refiners and blenders more time yesterday
to meet the requirement and more flexibility in how they meet
it.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude fell a seventh straight day, dropping 7 cents
to $16.15 a barrel. Gasoline’s  premium  over Brent narrowed 33
cents to $12.82.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, slipped a seventh
consecutive day, dropping 1.1 cents to $3.589 a gallon,
Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. Prices
are 5.8 cents below a year ago.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery declined
2.05 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.9437 a gallon on trading
volume that was 15 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 36 cents to $20.49 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose
10 cents to $17.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
