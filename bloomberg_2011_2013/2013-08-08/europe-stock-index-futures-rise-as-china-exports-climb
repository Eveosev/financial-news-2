European  stocks  were little changed
as an increase in Chinese exports offset investor concerns the
 Federal Reserve  will pare bond purchases this year. U.S. stock
futures and Asian shares were also little changed.  Deutsche Telekom (DTE)  rose 4.2 percent after second-quarter
sales beat forecasts. Commerzbank AG gained 8.9 percent after
profit in the second quarter exceeded analysts’ estimates. Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena slid 3.3 percent after reporting a
worse-than-forecast second-quarter loss.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell less than 0.1 percent to
302.75 at 8:30 a.m. in  London . The benchmark has rallied 9.8
percent since June 24 as the Federal Reserve,  European Central
Bank  and the  Bank of England  pledged to continue stimulus.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures added 0.1 percent today,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed less than 0.1 percent.  “With an apparent leaning towards a monetary tightening
environment, whether intended or not, bulls are struggling to
find any appetite to take markets higher,” Jonathan Sudaria, a
London-based analyst at Capital Spreads, which provides trading
services for retail customers, wrote in an e-mail.  The Stoxx 600 fell for a second day yesterday as the Bank
of England said it won’t raise  interest rates  or reduce bond
purchases until the U.K.’s jobless rate falls to 7 percent,
sparking concern it expects the economic recovery to be slow.  Chinese Trade  China ’s exports and imports rebounded in July more than
estimated. Exports rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier, the
General Administration of Customs said in Beijing today. That
compared with the median estimate for a 2 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey and June’s 3.1 percent drop. Imports rose
10.9 percent.  Fed Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra Pianalto  said
yesterday there has been “meaningful improvement” in the labor
market and that tapering may be warranted if it continues to
strengthen. Fed policy makers are weighing data to determine
whether the economy has improved enough to begin reducing its
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  U.S. initial jobless claims rose to 335,000 last week from
326,000 in the previous period, economists predicted before a
Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Deutsche Telekom added 4.2 percent to 9.43 euros.  Germany ’s
largest telephone company said revenue climbed 5.4 percent to
15.2 billion euros ($20.3 billion), beating analyst estimates of
14.6 billion euros. Net income rose 10 percent to 530 million
euros from a year earlier.  Commerzbank Income  Commerzbank gained 8.9 percent to 7.21 euros. Germany’s
second-largest bank reported second-quarter net income of 43
million euros, compared with 270 million euros in the second
quarter of last year, beating the 4.6 million-euro average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Adecco SA (ADEN)  rose 3.1 percent to 62 Swiss francs after the
world’s largest provider of temporary workers, reported
increased profit and said it sees positive signs for business as
labor markets in Europe stabilize. Second-quarter net income
rose 12 percent to 126 million euros, beating the 112.1 million-euro estimate of eight analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena  fell 3.3 percent to 20.1
euro cents after reporting a fifth straight quarterly loss. The
net loss at the world’s oldest bank fell to 279.3 million euros
from 1.64 billion euros a year earlier, when Monte Paschi wrote
down goodwill and intangible assets by more than 1.5 billion
euros. That was more than the average estimate for a 149.7
million-euro loss among six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Nestle Slows  Nestle SA (NESN)  declined 2.1 percent to 63.35 francs after the
world’s biggest food company posted the slowest first-half sales
growth in four years. Sales increased 4.1 percent, excluding
acquisitions, divestments and currency shifts, the Vevey,
Switzerland-based company said today in a statement. The median
of 14 analysts’ estimates was for 4.5 percent growth.  Adidas AG fell 1.8 percent to 84.28 euros. The sporting-goods maker cut its forecasts for 2013 because of “lackluster”
sales in Europe and unfavorable currency impacts after reporting
second-quarter net income rose 4.2 percent to 172 million euros.
That compared with the 175.8 million-euro average estimate of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
