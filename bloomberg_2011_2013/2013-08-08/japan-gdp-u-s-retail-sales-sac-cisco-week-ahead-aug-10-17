Japan ’s economy probably grew in 
the April-June period, its third straight quarter of growth, 
data in the coming week are likely to show.  In the U.S.,  retail sales  probably rose for a fourth
straight month and industrial production climbed for a second
month in July. The euro-area is likely to have exited a
recession in the second quarter after a record six quarters of
contraction, data may show.  Investors in SAC Capital Advisers LP face a deadline to
redeem money for the third quarter from founder Steven Cohen’s
hedge fund, which has been indicted for perpetrating what the
U.S. calls an unprecedented insider-trading scheme.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  and A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S will be among companies releasing results.  SATURDAY, AUG. 10  To contact the reporters on this story:
