Greece ’s unemployment rate rose to a
record in May, amid the sixth year of an economic slump that has
been deepened by austerity measures tied to bailouts from euro-area governments and the International Monetary Fund.  The seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 27.6 percent
from a revised 27 percent in April, the Athens-based Hellenic
Statistical Authority said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median estimate of four economists in a Bloomberg survey was
26.9 percent. The April unemployment rate was revised from a
previous reading of 26.9 percent.  Greece’s recession has been exacerbated by spending cuts
and tax increases linked to two bailouts from the euro area and
the IMF totaling 240 billion euros ($320 billion). Gross
domestic product contracted 6.4 percent in 2012 and will drop
4.2 percent this year before output expands in 2014, IMF staff
said in a report last week.  The unemployment rate for Greeks aged 15 to 24 was 64.9
percent, while the total female jobless rate was 31.6 percent.
The region with the highest rate was Epirus-western Macedonia,
at 30.5 percent.  The May unemployment rate is the highest level since the
agency began publishing monthly data in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
