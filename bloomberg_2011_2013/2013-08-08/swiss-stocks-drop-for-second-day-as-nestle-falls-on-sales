Swiss stocks  fell for a second day,
the first back-to-back declines this month, as  Nestle SA (NESN) 
retreated after reporting slower growth in sales.  Nestle slid 2.1 percent as the world’s largest food company
reported the slowest first-half revenue growth in four years.
Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-biggest reinsurer, dropped 1.7
percent after posting the first quarterly underwriting loss
since 2011.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the largest provider of temporary
workers, jumped 3.1 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  slipped 48.78 points, 0.6 percent to
7,927.5 at 9:36 a.m. in Zurich, as Nestle’s decline removed 35.7
points. The equity benchmark rallied 2.1 percent last week as
the  European Central Bank  said interest rates will remain low
for an extended period and the  Federal Reserve  kept its monthly
bond purchases unchanged. The broader Swiss Performance Index
lost 0.5 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 29 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fed Bank of Cleveland President  Sandra Pianalto  said
yesterday there has been “meaningful improvement” in the labor
market and that tapering may be warranted if it continues to
strengthen. Fed policy makers are weighing data to determine
whether the economy has improved enough to begin reducing its
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  U.S. initial jobless claims rose to 335,000 last week from
326,000 in the previous period, economists predicted before a
Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  In China, a report showed that exports and imports
rebounded more than estimated in July. Exports rose 5.1 percent
from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs said
in Beijing today. That compares with the median estimate for a 2
percent increase in a Bloomberg News survey and June’s 3.1
percent drop. Imports rose 10.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
