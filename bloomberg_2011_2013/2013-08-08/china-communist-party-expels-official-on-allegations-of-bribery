China ’s Communist Party expelled a
former vice chairman of the country’s top economic planning
agency, continuing a probe that began after a journalist posted
corruption allegations against him online.  An investigation by the Communist Party’s Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection found that Liu Tienan and
his relatives took “huge” amounts of bribes and also sought
benefits for their businesses, according to a  statement  posted
to the Ministry of Supervision’s website yesterday. Liu’s
illegal gains will be confiscated and his case transferred to
judicial organs, it said.  The prosecution comes as President Xi Jinping has vowed to
crack down on official corruption. Liu was stripped in May of
his position at the  National Development and Reform Commission ,
which approves infrastructure projects and controls energy
prices, after Luo Changping, deputy managing editor of Caijing
Magazine, posted allegations against Liu on his microblog in
December.  Last month, a court gave former Railway Minister Liu Zhijun
a suspended death sentence for abuse of power and taking bribes.
Authorities also officially charged ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai on July 25 with corruption and abuse of power, as the
Communist Party moved to resolve the biggest political crisis
it’s faced since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
