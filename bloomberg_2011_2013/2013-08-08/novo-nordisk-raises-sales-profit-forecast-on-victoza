Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) , the world’s largest
insulin maker, raised its sales and profit forecasts on higher
revenue from the Victoza diabetes treatment.  Novo now sees 2013 sales growth excluding currency shifts
of 11 percent to 13 percent, compared with an earlier forecast
of 9 percent to 11 percent, the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company
said in a  statement  today. Operating profit excluding currency
fluctuations will increase by 12 percent to 15 percent, the
company said, versus a previous prediction of about 10 percent.  Second-quarter net income climbed 26 percent to 6.73
billion kroner ($1.2 billion) from 5.35 billion kroner a year
earlier, the company. That beat the 6.48 billion kroner  average
estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue from Victoza, which mimics a hormone called GLP-1
and stimulates natural insulin production, jumped 25 percent to
2.88 billion kroner in the quarter, missing the average analyst
estimates of 2.91 billion kroner. Sales of its so-called modern
insulins, including Levemir, climbed 12 percent to 9.63 billion
kroner.  Although Novo is introducing a new insulin in  Europe ,
called Tresiba, the company faced a setback in February when
U.S. regulators rejected the product. Novo Nordisk developed the
medicine to challenge Sanofi’s top-selling Lantus, which
garnered 4.96 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in sales last year.  The  Food and Drug Administration  demanded a new study to
assess the heart risk of Tresiba, delaying its entry in the
biggest drug market by at least two years. The medicine,
approved in the Europe Union, is already sold in  Denmark , the
U.K.,  Switzerland ,  Mexico  and  Japan .  Total revenue in the quarter advanced 9.8 percent to 21.4
billion kroner. Analysts predicted 21.1 billion kroner.  Novo shares have  returned  5.8 percent including reinvested
dividends over the past year, compared with a 19 percent return
for the Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
