Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ,  Canada ’s
largest insurer, posted second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as increasing interest rates on bond funds
pushed up liabilities.  Net income was C$259 million ($249 million), or 12 cents a
share, compared with a restated loss of C$281 million, or 17
cents, a year earlier, the Toronto-based firm said today in a
statement. Profit excluding some items was 31 cents a share,
compared with the 32-cent  average estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Second-quarter net income is not as strong as we would
have liked, due to the impact of a number of market-related
items,” Chief Executive Officer Donald Guloien, 56, said in the
statement.  The company took a C$242 million charge as rates rose,
increasing its unhedged policy liabilities. About C$180 million
of these charges may reverse in future quarters, the company
said. The charge also included C$50 million in hedging costs
related to volatility in the Japanese stock market.  Guloien reaffirmed Manulife’s objective of reaching so-called core earnings of C$4 billion by 2016. Profit on that
basis for the quarter was C$609 million, a 1.7 percent rise over
last year.  Revenue from  wealth management  advanced 60 percent from the
same period last year to C$13.7 billion, a record, as the
company’s  Asia  unit doubled its sales. Manulife relies on Asia
for about 33 percent of its profit.  ‘A Breather’  Mutual-fund sales in the U.S. also doubled from a year
earlier. Overall insurance revenue declined 3 percent as the
Asian division adapted to higher product prices and a tax change
in April 2012 caused a spike in sales last year.  While Manulife’s adjusted earnings were solid, “we would
not be surprised to see its valuation take a bit of a breather
based on the modestly disappointing second-quarter earnings,”
 John Aiken , an analyst at Barclays Plc in Toronto, said in a
note to clients.  Manulife fell 0.6 percent to $17.93 at 10:22 a.m. in
Toronto. The shares have gained 33 percent this year,  outpacing 
the 6.1 percent gain of the 45-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Financials Index.  Sun Life, Canada’s third-largest insurer, said yesterday
that net income from continuing operations climbed 60 percent to
C$391 million as wealth-management and insurance sales
increased. Operating profit, which excludes some items, was 71
cents a share, beating by six cents the  average estimate  of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  (Manulife will hold a conference call today at 2 p.m. in
