Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
fewer onshore wind and solar farms will be allowed to be
built in Britain after changes in planning regulations.  There is also a case for continuing to review the
incentives offered for renewable energy, Cameron said in an
 interview  with the Plymouth, southwest England-based Western
Morning News.  “In terms of onshore wind, where there’s a lot of concern,
we have just set out new rules to make sure there are more
community benefits and a tougher system,” Cameron said,
according to the newspaper. “I suspect there will be fewer
schemes going ahead and I think we have got the right
framework.”  The prime minister defended cuts to domestic and commercial
solar-power projects, saying subsidies had been reduced as costs
came down.  ‘There is a case for supporting different forms of
renewable energy because we need to generate electricity safely
in this country,” the newspaper quoted Cameron as saying. “But
there’s always a case for looking at the individual subsidy
regimes and checking we have got them right.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
