General Motors Co. (GM)  said its mid-size
pickups will keep the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon names
when redesigned models reach showrooms next year, after the
automaker considered a change.  Chief Financial Officer Dan Ammann planned to show a
glimpse of the new trucks today during a presentation at the
Center for Automotive Research’s annual Management Briefing
Seminars near Traverse City,  Michigan .  “This is a segment that used to be a very big portion of
the overall truck market,” Ammann told reporters before his
presentation. “It’s diminished over the years partly because,
in our view, there hasn’t been the kind of offering in the
segment that customers were really looking for.”  The revamped pickups follow 18 new or refreshed vehicles
the biggest U.S. automaker is bringing out this year in its home
market. The trucks continue an effort to remake Detroit-based
GM’s lineup as among the newest in the industry from one of
the oldest.  “The Colorado will be positioned as a sport truck,”
Ammann said. “The Canyon will live squarely up to GMC brand
promise of professional grade.”  GM North America President  Mark Reuss  told reporters in
April that the automaker was considering new names for the
Colorado and Canyon. The company decided against a change
because of their brand equity, Ammann said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
