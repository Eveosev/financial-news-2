A former general manager at one of
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s websites was sentenced to seven
years in prison for taking bribes, Caixin Online  reported .  The former manager at the company’s Juhuasuan website
accepted 538,000  yuan  ($87,872) in bribes，Caixin reported,
citing documents from a court in Hangzhou. The employee, who was
detained by police in July last year, was removed in March 2012
for misconduct, according to a statement posted that year on a
 website  of  China ’s biggest e-commerce company.  Alibaba is expected by analysts to offer the largest
initial public offering since  Facebook Inc. (FB)  as early as this
year. It has taken steps to strengthen internal controls and
conduct employee training to protect its integrity, John Spelich, company spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The court also found four other former Juhuasuan employees
guilty for crimes related to bribery, according to Caixin. Three
calls to the Hangzhou West Lake District People’s Court outside
of business hours weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
