Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said today “we’re all singing from the
same song book” on when to taper the central bank’s bond
purchases.  Fisher, responding to a question about what Fed policy
makers plan to do in September, said he was referring to
comments this week by himself, Atlanta Fed President Dennis
Lockhart, Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto and Chicago
Fed President Charles Evans.  Fisher, in an interview on CNBC television, said any
tapering would depend on the incoming economic data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
