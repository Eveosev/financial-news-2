The yen’s breaching of a key trading
level opens the way for it to gain further versus the dollar
before reversing and continuing a longer-term decline, according
to Credit Suisse Group AG.  The Japanese currency strengthened through a resistance
range from 96.75 to 96.96 yesterday, according to Christopher Hine, a director of  technical analysis  at Credit Suisse in  New
York , and a further gain past 95.45 may allow it to climb to
94.73, the highest level since June 18. It is there that the yen
will establish a top before reversing direction and weakening,
Hine said.  “If dollar-yen gets down to the 95 area, we’ll be looking
to get long again before it trades back up toward the 100
mark,” Hine said in a telephone interview. “You’re getting to
a very good level to tactically buy in, which is what we’re
telling clients to do.” A long position is a bet an asset, in
this case the dollar, will increase in value.  Japan ’s currency was little changed at 96.38 per dollar at
2:01 p.m. after earlier appreciating as much as 0.5 percent to
95.81, its strongest level since June 19. The currency last
weakened to the 100 level on July 25.  The yen has support in the area from 97.55 to 97.60 that,
if breached, would lead to a decline toward 98.60, according to
Hine. Credit Suisse has a year-end dollar-yen forecast of 108,
which is more bearish than the median estimate of 105.  “If we see dollar-yen rally back up, fine, that confirms
what we were thinking,” Hine said. “Regardless, we’re getting
to a better spot where if you’re going to make a call on long
dollar-yen, you have a better risk-reward to play for.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
