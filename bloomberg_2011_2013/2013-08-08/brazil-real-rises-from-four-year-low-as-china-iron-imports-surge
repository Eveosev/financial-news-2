Brazil’s real rose from a four-year
low as China’s record  iron-ore  imports prompted speculation that
the Latin American nation’s inflows will increase.  The currency gained 0.5 percent to 2.3018 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:52 a.m. in Sao Paulo after falling yesterday to 2.3141, the
weakest since March 2009. Swap rates on the contract due in
January 2015 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 9.68 percent.  The real appreciated as China’s imports of iron ore rose 17
percent in July from a month earlier to 73.14 million metric
tons, the highest level in data compiled by Bloomberg going back
to 1990.  “Fear that the slowdown in China would be sharper and
worsen the  trade balance  diminished a bit,”  Reginaldo Galhardo ,
the head of currency trading at Treviso Corretora in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview.  The real has lost 13 percent in the past three months, the
worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The depreciation pushes up the price of imports and
threatens to further fuel inflation, which helped spark
nationwide street protests in June.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation reported that its IGP-M index
of wholesale, construction and consumer prices increased 0.13
percent from July 21 through July 31, slower than the 0.20
percent median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
