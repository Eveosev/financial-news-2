KBC Groep NV (KBC) , Belgium’s biggest bank
by market value, reported profit that beat estimates and cut its
remaining risk linked to collateralized debt obligations almost
by half, freeing more capital for reimbursement of state aid.  Net income of 517 million euros ($690 million) in the three
months through June, which compares with a loss a year earlier,
surpassed the 402 million-euro average of six analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue on an adjusted basis rose 5.1
percent to 1.83 billion euros and included a 126 million-euro
gain in the value of hedges used in asset and liability
management, Brussels-based KBC said today in a statement.  KBC, which spent 1.75 billion euros last month to repay a
first portion of the Flemish government rescue funds it got in
2009, almost made up for the loss in capital by unraveling
several CDOs and lowering the loss-provisioning rate for
insurance bought from MBIA Insurance Corp. to 60 percent. KBC’s
common equity ratio, as defined by a full application of Basel
III rules, was 11.8 percent after the reimbursement compared
with about 12 percent before. That gives KBC about 1.6 billion
euros of excess capital it could use for further state aid
reimbursements.  “We were impressed by the CDO size reduction,” Cor Kluis,
an analyst at Rabobank International in the Dutch city of
Utrecht, wrote in an investor note. “This increases expectation
of an additional government payback.”  Shares Rise  KBC climbed as much as 5.8 percent to 35.50 euros on
Euronext Brussels, the highest intraday value since September
2010, and traded 1.675 euros higher at 35.23 euros by 9:27 a.m.,
extending gains so far this year to 35 percent.  The bank’s net interest margin, the difference between what
the bank pays for funds and what it charges for loans, was
unchanged from the preceding three-month period at 1.72 percent.
The margin widened two basis points to 1.19 percent in  Belgium 
after KBC Bank lowered the interest rate on savings accounts in
May and contracted three basis points to 3.04 percent in the
Czech Republic.  Provisions for loan losses increased to 217 million euros
on an adjusted basis, including 88 million euros for Ireland,
and covered 65 percent of loans for which payments were at least
three months late at the end of the quarter, down from 67
percent at the end of March. The proportion of loans in arrears
rose the most in Slovakia and Ireland during the quarter. It
fell in  Hungary .  To contact the reporter on this story:
