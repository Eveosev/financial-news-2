CIC Insurance Group Ltd.,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest insurer by premiums, gained the most in almost a
week, paring losses made since announcing lower-than-expected
first-half earnings.  The shares  climbed  3.2 percent, the most since Aug. 2, to
4.80 shillings, the highest closing level since July 30. Almost
9.9 times of the three-month daily average volume of shares
traded.  CIC’s stock declined 4 percent through yesterday’s close
since the Nairobi-based insurer said July 31 that net income in
the six months through June increased 4.1 percent to 432.4
million shillings ($4.95 million). Most investors were expecting
a stronger performance, Augustine Misoka, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone.  “The stock came down after they announced weak earnings,”
Brenda Kithinji a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview. “That provided
an opportunity for some investors to get in.”  CIC’s stock has rallied 35 percent this year, outpacing a
29 percent advance by the FTSE NSE 25 Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
