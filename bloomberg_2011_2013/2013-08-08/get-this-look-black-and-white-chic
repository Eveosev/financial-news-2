If there ever was a color palette that has stayed in style, it's black and white. Cutting-edge yet classic, black and white can fit in a traditional, modern or contemporary space. "A kitchen looks crisp and timeless, a bedroom glamorous and luxurious," said Jessica Lagrange, principal at  Jessica Lagrange Interiors . "It never matters if the colors [black and white] are used in moderation or executed lavishly; they always work together to create powerful spaces." The Bedroom Black and white is a perfect neutral palette for a bedroom and can be used to create a modern or traditional setting. A mix of graphic prints on pillows and bedding — paired with black furniture and sleek chrome light fixtures — creates a sleek and modern bedroom. Rounded pillows and a solid white duvet, just edged in black, give the room the softness it needs. "It's all about layers," said Lagrange. "Interest lies in mixing patterns and prints. A well-designed space employs a range of scales, whether patterns or solids." The black in the bedroom pictured above is applied sparingly to create a traditional suite. The wall is papered with a diamond black-and-white pattern, which contrasts against the geometric patterned pillows. Red lampshades give the room a touch of glamour. The Kitchen With not a lot of room for accessories or big furniture, the design elements in a kitchen come mainly through color choices for cabinets and flooring. Lagrange designed an eat-in kitchen with black-and-white checkered tile, explaining "a bold flooring tile layout in a modern setting is extraordinary." Apple-green accents keep the space playful. Cabinets and countertops are an easy swap in a kitchen, and black and white can create the right level of contrast. The kitchen pictured above features white-marble counters and black-painted cabinetry with sleek hardware. Living Room As previously mentioned, a black and white room can be contemporary or classic. "The key," said Lagrange, "is careful placement — making the room come alive. Doses of warm and cool as well as interjection of shapes, patterns and textures work to provide a space with depth and contrast." Different black and white patterns keep an all-white space from looking bland. Graphic designs and minimal furnishings will create a more contemporary look. A traditional room comes alive with rich detailing: long drapes, architectural details, brass accents and classic accessories, like a grand piano.
