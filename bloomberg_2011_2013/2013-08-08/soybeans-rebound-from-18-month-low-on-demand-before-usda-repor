Soybeans climbed as a slump to the
lowest level in 18 months spurred demand before the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  updates its production estimates.  The contract for November delivery rose as much as 0.7
percent to $11.74 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was
at $11.715 at 12:30 p.m. in  Singapore . Futures fell to $11.625
yesterday, the lowest level since January 2012.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of eight  agricultural 
commodities tumbled 19 percent this year as corn lost 34 percent
and soybeans dropped 17 percent on expectations U.S. crops will
be the biggest ever. The Department of Agriculture said in July
that farmers may harvest a record 3.42 billion bushels of
soybeans, helping boost world inventories 20 percent from a year
earlier to an all-time high. The agency is set to update its
output, supply and demand estimates on Aug. 12.  “You’ve got the USDA production and supply and demand
reports so there’s probably a little bit of squaring up ahead of
that,” said Brett Cooper, senior manager markets at FCStone
Australia Pty. Corn and soybeans “have had a fair retracement
since the previous report.”  The USDA said in July U.S. farmers may harvest a record
13.95 billion bushels of corn, 29 percent more than the prior
year, when crops were hurt by drought.  China ’s soybean imports may be 5.3 million metric tons this
month, the Ministry of Commerce said in a statement on its
website dated yesterday. U.S. exporters sold 220,000 tons of the
oilseed to China, the world’s biggest buyer, for delivery in the
year starting Sept. 1, the USDA said yesterday.  Corn for December delivery gained 0.6 percent to $4.6075 a
bushel, rising for the first time in six days. Wheat for
delivery in December rose 0.1 percent to $6.57 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
