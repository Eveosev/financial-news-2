Gold advanced the most in two weeks
as the dollar dropped for the fifth straight session, increasing
demand for the precious metal as an alternative investment.  The Bloomberg Dollar Index, a  gauge  against 10 major
trading partners, fell as much as 0.5 percent, heading for the
longest slide since April. Exports rebounded in China, signaling
improving economic growth in the world’s biggest bullion buyer
after India.  “The continued weakness in dollar is making gold look
attractive,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Also, there is some
buying in anticipation of a rise in retail Chinese demand as the
economy improves.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.4 percent to
$1,303.60 an ounce at 10:40 a.m. on the Comex in New York,
heading for the biggest gain since July 22.  Through yesterday, prices tumbled 23 percent this year
partly on concern that the  Federal Reserve  will trim its
monetary stimulus as the  U.S. economy  improves. The fewest
Americans applied for  unemployment benefits  over the past month
since before the last recession, a Labor Department report
showed today.  “Continued weakness in the dollar is negating the effect
of the good jobs data,” Lesh said.  China  may top India to become the largest importer of gold
this year, according to London-based World Gold Council.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 2.9 percent to
$20.075 an ounce, heading for the biggest gain for a most-active
contract since July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
