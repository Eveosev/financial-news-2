Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , a U.S. biofuel company
that produces oil from algae, surged after reporting a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss.  Solazyme gained 13 percent to $12.65 at the close in New
York, the most since November 2011.  The net loss was $25.8 million, or 28 cents a share,
excluding one-time items, the South San Francisco, California-based company said in a statement released yesterday after the
close of regular trading. The average per-share loss of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 36 cents.  The company’s quarterly revenue of $11.2 million exceeded
the average of nine analysts’ estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
