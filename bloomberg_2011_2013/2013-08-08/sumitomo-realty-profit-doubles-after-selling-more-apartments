Sumitomo Realty & Development Co.,
 Japan ’s third-biggest developer, said first-quarter profit
nearly doubled after the company sold more apartments.  Net income  rose 95 percent to 22.2 billion yen ($231
million) in the three months ended June 30 from 11.4 billion yen
a year earlier, the company said in a statement distributed
through the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. Sales climbed 40 percent
to 205.7 billion yen from the same period a year ago.  Sumitomo Realty and its competitor,  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802) ,
are benefiting from a surge in apartment sales ahead of the
government’s plan to raise taxes. Completed condominium
inventory in the Tokyo metropolitan area is at its lowest level
since at least 2000, according to the Real Estate Economic
Institute.  Japan plans to double the  tax rate  to 10 percent from 5
percent by 2015, in two steps. The first increase is scheduled
to come in April 2014 when the tax is raised to 8 percent.  Mitsubishi Estate last week said profit rose 44 percent for
the same period, citing an improvement in profitability of its
residential business.  Operating profit for Sumitomo Realty’s residential business
nearly tripled to 16.8 billion yen in the quarter from 6.6
billion yen in the same period last year. The company sold more
than double the number of apartments, houses and land sites in
the quarter from the same period last year. Operating profit for
the leasing business was little changed at 24.4 billion yen, it
said.  The Tokyo-based company kept its net income forecast
unchanged at 68 billion yen for the year ending March 2014 on
sales of 760 billion yen, it said.  Sumitomo’s  shares  were up 0.4 percent to 4,275 yen at the
close in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
