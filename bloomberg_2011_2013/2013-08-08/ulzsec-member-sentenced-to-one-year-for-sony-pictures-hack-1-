A 21-year-old member of the LulzSec
hacking group was sentenced to one year in prison for his part
in a 2011 attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.
computer network, prosecutors said.  Raynaldo Rivera, who used the moniker “neuron,” was also
sentenced to serve an additional 13 months home detention and
ordered to pay $606,000 in restitution, according to a statement
today from U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in  Los Angeles .
Rivera pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to participate in
the attack, according to the statement.  LulzSec in 2011 posted statements online saying it had
broken into SonyPictures.com and downloaded unencrypted personal
information including passwords, e-mail addresses and dates of
birth from 1 million user accounts. The attack followed earlier
ones in which Tokyo-based  Sony Corp. (6758)  had said more than 100
million accounts were compromised.  The case is U.S. v. Rivera, 12-cr-798, U.S. District Court,
Central District of  California  (Los Angeles.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
