Cotton production in  India , the
world’s second-biggest exporter, will climb to a record as
above-average monsoon rainfall increased planting, Agriculture
Minister Sharad Pawar said.  “The growing areas have received very good rains,” Pawar
said in an interview yesterday. “Excessive rains in some areas
will not impact the total output. Production should reach a
record.” The harvest was the highest ever at 35.2 million bales
of 170 kilograms each in 2011-2012, according to Agriculture
Ministry data. Production was 34 million bales in 2012-2013.  A larger crop in India may curb an 18 percent rally in  New
York  futures this year. The country had the best start to the
monsoon since 1994, with rainfall 15 percent above a 50-year
average, according to the India Meteorological Department. That
boosted seeding of crops from rice to cotton and sugar cane.  Damage to the cotton crop from excess rain is limited,
Pawar said. Planting increased to 10.9 million hectares (26.9
million acres) as of Aug. 2 from 10.1 million hectares a year
earlier, according to the Agriculture Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
