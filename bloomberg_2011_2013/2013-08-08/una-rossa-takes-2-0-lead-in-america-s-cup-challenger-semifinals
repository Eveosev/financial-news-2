Italy’s Luna Rossa took a 2-0 lead
over Artemis Racing in the America’s Cup challenger semifinals
on the  San Francisco Bay .  Luna Rossa won yesterday by two minutes, six seconds with
its 72-foot catamaran after getting a two-minute victory in the
series opener on Aug. 6.  “We sailed a good race, but I know we can sail much, much
better,” Luna Rossa helmsman Chris Draper told reporters
yesterday.  Artemis is operating a new boat that was put into training
July 22 after its first boat capsized during a training run on
May 9, trapping crew member Andrew Simpson beneath.  Race 3 is tomorrow and Race 4 follows the next day.  The winner of the semifinals advances to face Emirates Team
New Zealand in the Louis Vuitton Cup. The winner of that series
advances to race against defending champion Oracle Team USA in
the America’s Cup match starting Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
