Colombia  has reduced the area of land
used for cocaine production to the lowest since records began
tracking it, according to a report published by the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.  Land planted with coca bushes, the raw material for making
cocaine, fell to 48,000 hectares in 2012, down from 64,000
hectares in 2011, says the report. The UN estimates that cocaine
production in Colombia fell 10 percent to 309 metric tons last
year.  The Colombian government uses manual and aerial spraying
methods to eradicate coca plants across the Andean nation,
partially funded by Plan Colombia, a US counter-narcotics
program started by the Clinton administration. In a speech last
year, White House Drug Policy Director Richard Gil Kerlikowske
said Colombian cocaine production had fallen behind Peru and
 Bolivia .  “These reductions have cost lives in our police and armed
forces,” Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzon said at an event
in the UNODC office in Bogota. “It is with cocaine production
and illegal mining that terrorist groups and criminal gangs in
this country are financing their activities.”  Colombian armed groups include the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, and organized crime gangs. The FARC has been engaged in a
five-decade armed struggle against the Colombian government and
is currently participating in peace talks in  Havana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
