U.S. states collected 8.6 percent
more revenue in the first three months of 2013 than the same
period last year, the 13th straight quarter of growth, according
to a report by the Nelson A.  Rockefeller Institute  of
Government.  Higher personal income tax receipts account for the revenue
gain, although some taxpayers accelerated income into 2012 to
avoid higher federal taxes, according to the report, released
today. Individual income-tax collections were up 18.4 percent.  It is the second straight quarter since the start of the
18-month recession that ended June 30, 2009, that inflation-adjusted quarterly state tax collections for most states are
higher compared with peak levels, although those periods are
“artificially boosted” because of the income-tax receipts,
according to the report.  “While the Great Recession ended over three years ago, the
damage caused by the Great Recession on state tax revenues is
significant and it will take years before the states fully
recover,” Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the  Albany ,
New York-based institute, and Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at
the institute, said in the report.  State revenue is set to gain in the second quarter of 2013,
based on preliminary April and May collections from 47 early-reporting states.  “However, June is the most important month in the quarter
and these early results may not reflect the full quarter,”
according to the report.  -- Editors:  Justin Blum , Laurie Asseo  To contact the reporter on this story:
