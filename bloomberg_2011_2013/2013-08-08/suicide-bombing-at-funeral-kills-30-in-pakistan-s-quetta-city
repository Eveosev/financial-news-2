At least 30 people were killed and 40
others injured in a suicide bomb attack at the funeral of a
police officer in  Pakistan ’s southwestern city of Quetta today,
a police spokesman said.  The bomber blew himself up as people, mostly policemen,
lined up to pay respects to the officer, who was shot dead in
the city early today, Shahzada Farhad, a spokesman for
Baluchistan police, said by phone from Quetta. Fayyaz Sumbal, a
deputy inspector general of police of the Baluchistan province,
of which Quetta is the capital, was among the dead, he said.  “It was a suicide attack and some of the injured are in
critical condition,” Farhad said.  The bombing is the latest in a new wave of violence that
has struck the predominantly Islamic nation since the government
of Prime Minister  Nawaz Sharif  took over after the May 11
parliamentary polls. At least 18 people have been killed in
three attacks this week, including in a bombing during a
football match in the biggest city of Karachi.  Militants from the Pakistani Taliban and other sectarian
groups routinely target the country’s security forces and
opposing groups mostly in the troubled northwest that shares a
border with  Afghanistan .  The U.S. has been pushing its nuclear-armed ally Pakistan
to extend its operations in the northwest to include groups like
the Haqqani network that attack U.S and Afghan forces across the
border. The U.S. plans to hand over security to Afghan forces
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
