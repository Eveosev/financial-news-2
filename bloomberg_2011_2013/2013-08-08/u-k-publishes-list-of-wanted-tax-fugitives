The U.K. tax agency published a list
of its 30 most wanted tax fugitives, trumpeting the capture of
one of those being sought after 10 years on the run.  The updated list, first published last year, adds 10 names
to the  20 tax fugitives  initially included, Her Majesty’s
Revenue & Customs said in an e-mailed statement today. They are
wanted for offenses including fraud and tax evasion that HMRC
says have cost the government as much as 10 million pounds
($15.5 million).  “Tax fraud and evasion is illegal and will not be
tolerated,” Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in
the statement. “Millions of hard-working people pay their taxes
and it is they who are being defrauded.”  The list is credited with facilitating two arrests. Anthony
Judge, who had been a fugitive for a decade and was being
pursued for more than 350,000 pounds of tax fraud, was arrested
at London’s Heathrow airport last month. Another man, John
Nugent, was detained in the U.S. in May after officials viewed
his picture on the list, HMRC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
