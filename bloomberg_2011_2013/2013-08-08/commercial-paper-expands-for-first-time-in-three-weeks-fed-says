The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  expanded for the first time in three
weeks, led by a rise in issuance from financial institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
outstanding rose $3.3 billion to $988.2 billion in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
That’s the highest level since the week ended July 24.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S.  financial institutions 
rose for a fifth week, increasing $2.2 billion to $248.1
billion. That’s the highest level since the week ended Jan. 30.
The amount issued by  U.S.-based banks  increased for the first
time in three weeks, climbing $4 billion to $260.4 billion
outstanding, according to the Fed.  Corporations sell commercial paper, typically maturing in
270 days or less, to fund everyday activities such as rent and
salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
