Canada’s new home  price index  rose
0.2 percent in June, led by increases in Calgary, the government
statistics agency said.  Calgary, which recorded a 0.5 percent advance, has led
gains for five straight months,  Statistics Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Prices also rose 0.5 percent in Saskatoon and 0.3
percent in Edmonton.  Economists predicted the index would rise 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg  survey  with nine
responses. From a year earlier, new home prices increased 1.8
percent in June.  Today’s data showed prices in Toronto, the nation’s largest
city by population, were unchanged in June. Montreal, the
second-largest, saw house prices climb 0.1 percent while those
in Vancouver, the third-largest, fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
