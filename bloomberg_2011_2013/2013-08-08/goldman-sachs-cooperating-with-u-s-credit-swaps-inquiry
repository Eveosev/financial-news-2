Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc., the fifth-largest  U.S. bank  by assets, said it’s cooperating with the U.S.
Department of Justice’s four-year-old antitrust probe into the
credit-default swaps market.  The firm has received civil investigative demands related
to the investigation, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
regulatory  filing  today. The bank was among more than a dozen
financial institutions accused by the European Union last month
of colluding to curb competition in credit derivatives.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Citigroup Inc. also said in filings last
week that they were cooperating with the probe. The Justice
Department sent civil investigative notices in July 2009 to the
banks that own London-based Markit Group Ltd., a provider of
data on derivatives and bonds, to find out if they had unfair
access to price information, three people familiar with the
matter said at the time.  Markit’s shareholders included Goldman Sachs,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America Corp. , and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, according to filings with the U.K.’s Companies House
at the time. Bloomberg LP, the owner of Bloomberg News, competes
with Markit in selling information to the financial-services
industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
