Developing shale gas in  Saudi
Arabia  will be a challenge as most of it is in deep reservoirs
with very low permeability, according to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  The country, the world’s largest crude exporter, still has
“great potential” in shale gas and needs to develop the
resources to meet rising domestic demand, Adnan Kanaan, general
supervisor for gas reservoir management at the state-owned
producer known as Saudi Aramco, said today at a conference in
Khobar, Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Aramco will work with international service companies
such as  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) ,  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  and Schlumberger Ltd.
to develop shale gas, Kanaan said.  Natural-gas prices in Saudi Arabia are low, making
developing the kingdom’s unconventional gas deposits such as
shale and tight gas economically challenging, Khalid al-Falih,
the head of  Saudi Aramco , said in January. The company is
drilling a number of wells for shale and tight gas in the
northwest of the country, he said. Saudi Arabia sells gas
locally at a subsidized price of 75 cents per million British
thermal units.  To contact the reporter on this story:
