The  Federal Reserve  bought
$4.76 billion in Treasury securities as part of its plan to
lower borrowing costs that is known as Operation Twist.  The central bank bought debt maturing from April 2018 to
November 2019 in its second open-market operation of the day,
according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s  website . It
purchased $1.843 billion of notes due in February 2036 to May
2041 earlier.  The Fed is replacing $400 billion of short-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to limit borrowing costs
and counter risks of a recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
