The cost of insuring Australian and
Japanese corporate bonds from default increased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index rose 9 basis points to
158 as of 10 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices show.
The benchmark is set for its highest close since Jan. 30,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index climbed half a basis point to
163.5 as of 9 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche Bank AG. The
guage is also poised for its highest close since Jan. 30,
according to CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was at 165.5 basis points as of 8:01
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The measure has traded between 132.5 and 209 this year, CMA
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
