Australian help-wanted notices
advanced in March for a third straight month, reaching the
highest level in 3 1/2 years, as resource investment spurs
hiring, a private report showed.  Jobs advertised  in newspapers and on the Internet rose 1
percent last month, according to an  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  report released in Melbourne today. From a
year earlier, recruitment postings were 2.8 percent higher and
are the highest since November 2008, it said.  The report underscores  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens’s decision at all three meetings this year to keep
the nation’s benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.25 percent,
the highest level among major developed nations. Resource
projects valued at A$456 billion ($470 billion), fueled by
companies such as  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , are helping cushion a slump
in manufacturing and services hurt by a strong currency.  “Increased volatility in other activity indicators from
the rising importance of mining may spill over into job ads at
times, but we remain optimistic on hiring intentions as a result
of the mining boom,”  Warren Hogan , chief economist at ANZ Bank,
said in a statement.  An April 12 government report is expected to show employers
added 6,500 workers in March and the jobless rate advanced to
5.3 percent from 5.2 percent, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of 24 economists.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers fell 0.6
percent in March, and Internet notices advanced 1 percent,
today’s report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
