Nigeria ’s naira gained against the
dollar as subdued demand for the U.S. currency and strong  oil
prices  led to an increase in the nation’s foreign reserves.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer advanced 0.1
percent to 157.55 per dollar as of 10:44 a.m. on the  interbank
market  in Lagos, the commercial capital. The naira has risen 3
percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign-exchange reserves have risen 9 percent this year to
$35.8 billion as of April 4, according to the  Central Bank of
Nigeria . The regulator, based in the capital Abuja,  sold  $250
million last week at auction, the lowest amount since November.  The rise in reserves “is consistent with the subdued
demand for foreign exchange at the CBN’s auctions in first
quarter 2012,” Gregory Kronsten, the London-based head of
macroeconomic research at FBN Capital Ltd., wrote in an e-mailed
note today. There has been “an enhanced supply” of dollars on
the market, he said.  Nigerian benchmark  Bonny Light crude  has advanced 12
percent this year, supporting the increase in reserves.  Yields on the West African nation’s $500 million of dollar
bonds rose three basis points, or 0.03 percent, to 5.429 percent
in  London . Borrowing costs on domestic 2019 bonds fell eight
basis points to 15.21 percent according to April 5 prices on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana’s cedi dropped 0.6 percent to 1.7875 per dollar as of
9:48 a.m. in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
