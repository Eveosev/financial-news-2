The House Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform said it is examining California High Speed
Rail Authority operations and use of federal funds.  “Of particular concern to the committee is how CHSRA has
already spent or plans to spend the nearly $4 billion in federal
taxpayer money already authorized for its high-speed rail
project,” the committee said today in a statement.  Chairman  Darrell Issa  has requested current and former
board members -- as well as current and former executive
leadership -- preserve documents, records and communications,
according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
