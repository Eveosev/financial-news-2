Sudan ’s military has attacked a
town in an oil-producing border area of  South Sudan , according
to that country’s information minister, Barnaba Marial Benjamin.  Two brigades belonging to the Sudanese Armed Forces
attacked the town of Abiemnhom in South Sudan’s Unity state,
injuring four civilians, including a child, Benjamin said today
by phone from Juba, the southern capital.  Al-Sawarami Khaled, a spokesman for Sudan’s army, and
foreign affairs spokesman al-Obeid Murawih didn’t answer calls
made seeking comment today.  South Sudan seceded from the north in July, assuming
control of about three-quarters of the formerly unified nation’s
daily oil production of 490,000 barrels. The north and south
fought a two-decade civil was that ended in 2005.  “They have been trying to move into Unity state with the
intention of occupying the  oil fields ,” Benjamin said. “South
Sudan condemns the bombardment and calls on the Republic of
Sudan to withdraw its forces.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
