Cameroon,  Africa ’s fourth-biggest
cocoa producer, began sending pesticides to areas affected by a
spreading caterpillar outbreak, said Agriculture and Rural
Development Minister Essimi Menye.  Mbom Yekombo and Meyomessala in southern Cameroon each got
1,000 liters (264 gallons) in recent days, Menye said in an
interview in Yaounde, the capital, today. The south is
Cameroon’s third-biggest growing region.  Caterpillars attacked about 2,000 hectares of cocoa
plantations in the south a week ago, destroying 50 percent of
plants, Oscar Edima Ndoum, agriculture and rural development
delegate for Dja and Lobo in the south, said by phone.  “The effects of the attack will surely be disastrous with
a likely drop in production,” he said.  Earlier this year, a caterpillar outbreak was recorded in
Cameroon’s southwest region. Bug attacks may curb cocoa
production this season by as much as 19 percent, according to
the Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Cameroon follows  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Nigeria  as Africa’s
biggest grower of the chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
