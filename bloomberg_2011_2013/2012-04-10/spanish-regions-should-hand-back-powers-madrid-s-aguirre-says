Spanish regions should return some
powers to the central government to save money, said Esperanza Aguirre, president of the region of  Madrid .  Aguirre estimated that by avoiding duplication and
promoting efficiency, handing some responsibilities back to the
central government and passing others to municipalities could
save 48 billion euros ($63 billion).  “If it’s necessary for Spain, the big departments --
health, education, justice -- should be returned to the central
government,” Aguirre told reporters after meeting Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  today. “We politicians would be left
without a job, but we’d look for one.”  Spain’s regions, of which Catalonia and Madrid are the
biggest, spend about 60 percent of their budgets on health and
education and are struggling to rein in deficits after the
collapse of the real-estate boom slashed  tax revenue . Aguirre, a
member of Rajoy’s  People’s Party  and once a potential rival for
the leadership, runs the region that had the lowest deficit last
year.  Of the 17 regions, which were created as part of Spain’s
return to democracy in 1978, 11 are ruled by the PP. Catalonia,
the biggest, is run by Convergencia i Unio, a pro-business,
nationalist party that seeks more independence from Spain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
