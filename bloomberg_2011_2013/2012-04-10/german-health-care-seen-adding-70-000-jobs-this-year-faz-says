Germany â€™s health-care system is
likely to add 70,000 jobs this year, the  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, citing a survey by the German Association of
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, also known as  DIHK .  Jobs are being created by pharmaceutical and medical-device
companies, as well as by hospital and nursing-home operators,
the newspaper said. Health care employs more than 4 million
people and staff are increasingly scarce, the FAZ cited DIHK
President Hans Heinrich Driftmann as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
