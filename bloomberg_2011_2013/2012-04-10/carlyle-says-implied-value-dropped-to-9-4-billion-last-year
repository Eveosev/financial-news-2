Carlyle Group LP (CG)  said it had an
implied enterprise value of about $9.4 billion at the end of
2011, down from $10 billion at the end of 2010.  The amounts were based on fair value estimates of equity
interests tied to Carlyleâ€™s 2010 purchase of a majority stake in
hedge fund manager Claren Road Asset Management LLC, according
to a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
