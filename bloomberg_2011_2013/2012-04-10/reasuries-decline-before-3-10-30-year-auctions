Treasuries snapped a rally on
concern yields that slid to a four-week low will curb demand as
investors bid for $66 billion of notes and bonds starting today.  Ten-year notes yielded negative 85 basis points after
accounting for consumer prices, the biggest difference in almost
a month. Yields are becoming less attractive just as the U.S.
prepares to sell $32 billion of 3-year notes today, $21 billion
of 10-year debt tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on
April 12. A government report today will probably show wholesale
inventories rose for a fifth month in February, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Ten-year notes  yielded  2.05 percent as of 1:03 p.m. in
 Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
note due in February 2022 was little changed at 99 17/32,
halting a four-day advance. The yield was as low as 2.02 percent
yesterday, the least since March 12.  “Yields approaching 2 percent are expensive,” said
Youngsung Kim, the head of fixed income in  Seoul  at Samsung
Asset Management Co., South Korea’s largest private bond
investor. “The  U.S. economy  is pretty good. I’m bearish” on
Treasuries, he said. Samsung Asset is avoiding the securities
for now, Kim said.  U.S. wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent in February,
quickening from January’s 0.4 percent gain, the median estimate
of the Bloomberg survey shows before the Commerce Department
reports the figure.  Japan ’s 10-year rate was little changed at 0.965 percent.  BOJ, China Surplus  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  left its benchmark  interest rate  in a
range of zero to 0.1 percent and stimulus programs unchanged.
China reported a $5.35 billion  trade surplus  for March, whereas
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a deficit.  Treasuries rose yesterday as investors sought the safety of
 U.S. debt  on concern the global recovery is slowing.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the economy has yet to
recover, in a speech yesterday in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  “About three and a half years have passed since the
darkest days of the financial crisis, but our economy is still
far from having fully recovered from its effects,” Bernanke
said.  U.S. yields tumbled April 6 when a Labor Department report
showed jobs growth fell short of forecasts in March, spurring
speculation the Fed will be more inclined to initiate a third
round of asset purchases, known as quantitative easing.  Narrower TIPS Spread  The  difference  between 10-year yields on conventional U.S.
 government securities  and Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities narrowed to 2.20 percentage points on April 6, the
smallest spread since March 7. The gap is a projection of the
rate of inflation during the life of the securities.  The Fed is scheduled to buy as much as $2 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to February 2042 today. It
also plans to purchase as much as $5 billion of government
securities maturing from April 2018 to February 2020, according
to the Fed bank of New York  website.   The central bank is replacing $400 billion of shorter-term
debt in its holdings with longer maturities to hold down
borrowing costs.  The  Bollinger band  technical indicator showed the decline
in 10-year yields is set to stop.  Yields as low as 2.046 percent today approached the so-
called lower Bollinger level of 2.04 percent. Bollinger bands
gauge volatility by plotting standard deviations above and below
a moving average. Analysts use them to determine a probable
range for a rate or security.  To contact the reporter on this
