Treasuries snapped a rally on
speculation yields that slid to a four-week low will curb demand
as investors prepared to bid for $66 billion of notes and bonds
at three auctions starting today.  Yields on 10-year notes were 81 basis points below the rate
of inflation, the most in almost a month. The U.S. will sell $32
billion of three-year notes today, $21 billion of 10-year debt
tomorrow and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on April 12.  “I don’t expect too much more movement before the
auctions,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV
in Brussels. “We don’t have much appetite for Treasuries at
these levels, and I suspect others don’t either.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.05 percent at 7:28 a.m.
New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent securities maturing in February 2022 were little changed
at 99 17/32. The yields touched 2.02 percent yesterday, the
lowest level since March 12.  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 0.460
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.456 percent at
the previous offering of the securities March 12.  Investors bid for 3.44 times the amount of debt available
last month, compared with the average for the past 10 sales of
3.37 percent. Indirect  bidders , which include foreign central
banks, purchased 34.6 percent, versus the 10-auction average of
37 percent.  Auction Demand  Treasury  auctions  are drawing record demand in 2012. Buyers
bid $3.19 for each dollar of the $538 billion in notes and bonds
sold this year, the most since the government began releasing
the data in 1992.  The Fed is scheduled to buy as much as $2 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to February 2042 today,
according to the New York Fed’s  website.  The central bank also
plans to purchase as much as $5 billion of  government securities 
maturing from April 2018 to February 2020.  Treasuries earlier erased losses as the Bank of  Japan 
decided against expanding its stimulus efforts and a Chinese
report showed import growth trailed forecasts, boosting demand
for safer securities.  Japan’s central bank kept its target lending rate in a
range of zero to 0.1 percent and left its 30 trillion yen ($370
billion) asset-purchase fund and 35 trillion yen credit-lending
program unchanged. Chinese imports increased 5.3 percent in
March, the customs bureau said, less than the 9 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Risk-Averse’  “We are firmly in a risk-averse environment with economic
concerns and euro risk very much still in play,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole SA in
 London . “This has been a source of support for Treasuries.”  The Stoxx Europe 600  index  fell 1.2 percent, and the  MSCI
Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid 0.3 percent. Standard & Poor’s
500 Index futures advanced 0.2 percent.  Germany ’s two-year yield slid as much as three basis points
to 0.112 percent, the least since Bloomberg started collecting
the data in 1990. The five-years yield dropped as much as five
basis points to 0.664 percent, also an all-time low.  Treasury 10-year yields tumbled 13 basis points on April 6,
when a Labor Department report showed U.S. job growth in March
trailed forecasts, fueling speculation the Fed may be more
inclined to initiate a third round of asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing.  Wholesale Inventories  U.S. wholesale inventories climbed 0.5 percent in February
after rising 0.4 percent in the prior month, a Bloomberg survey
showed before the Commerce Department report today.  “Yields approaching 2 percent are expensive,” said
Youngsung Kim, head of fixed income in  Seoul  at Samsung Asset
Management Co.,  South Korea ’s largest private bond investor.
“The  U.S. economy  is pretty good.” Samsung is avoiding the
securities for now, Kim said.  Ten-year Treasury futures may reach their 2012 high if they
break above a level of resistance, according to Credit Suisse
Group AG, citing trading patterns.  An advance beyond 131 29/32 will open the way for a rally
to 132 11/32, said Chris Hine, a technical strategist at the
firm in London. The 10-year contract expiring in June 2012
declined 1/8 to 131. Resistance refers to an area where sell
orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
