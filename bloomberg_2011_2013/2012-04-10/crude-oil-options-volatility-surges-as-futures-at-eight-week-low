Crude oil options volatility surged
as the underlying futures slid to an eight-week low on
speculation that U.S. inventories rose last week and that the
euro-region debt crisis is spreading.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 29.4 percent as of 2:30 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 26.4 yesterday. Volatility is
the highest since March 7.  “As the market drops, producers who are hedging their
production will buy puts as will hedgers of long speculative
positions,” said Vince Lanci, managing partner at Echobay
Partners LLC, a commodity investment firm in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “You have a market that is long in general and all
those people start running for the exits at the same time, and
that will push volatility up.”  Crude for May delivery fell $1.44, or 1.4 percent, to
settle at $101.02 on the Nymex after touching $100.75, the
lowest level since Feb. 15.  The Energy Department will probably report tomorrow that
crude inventories rose 2 million barrels last week to 364.4
million, the highest level for this time of year since 1990,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Spanish notes led a decline in the debt of  Europe ’s higher-
yielding nations. German yields slid to records on concern that
a slowing world economy will deepen the region’s debt crisis.  Volatility ‘Aggressive’  “Volatility was particularly aggressively bid today because
of a large fear of a follow-through on this move, and  Spain  is
not helping,” Lanci said.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
