The Chicago Board Options Exchange
 Volatility Index (VIX)  advanced for a record eighth day as surging
Spanish and Italian bond yields intensified concern about the
European debt crisis.  The gauge known as the VIX, which measures the cost of
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index options,  rose  8.4 percent to 20.39
today. That’s within 0.8 percent of its lifetime average of
20.54, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell
1.7 percent.  Spanish bonds dropped as Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
declined to rule out a rescue for the nation. Concern over
 Europe  coupled with a report showing less U.S. job creation than
economists projected has sent the S&P 500 down 4.3 percent in
five days, the biggest loss since November.  “The VIX movements reflect the increased fear off the
recent performance of the  S&P 500 , the poor unemployment number,
and rekindling of fears out of Europe focused on Spain and
 Italy ,” Nelson Saiers, who oversees about $650 million as chief
investment officer at Alphabet Management LLC in New York, said
in an interview.  The measure of expected S&P 500 volatility reached its
lowest level since June 2007 on March 26 as the S&P 500 had its
biggest first-quarter rally in 14 years, climbing 12 percent.
The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities reached 1,419.04 on April
2, its highest level since May 2008, after reports showed retail
sales and manufacturing improved.  The VIX, which tumbled as much as 70 percent since reaching
a 29-month high on Aug. 8, has advanced 32 percent in the past
eight trading sessions.  “It’s a significant string of increases, but there’s no
panic in the volatility market,” said Ben Londergan, chief
executive officer of Group One Trading LP, the Chicago-based
primary market maker for VIX options. “This is more likely an
increase from a low level in the VIX combined with a healthy and
legitimate sell-off in equities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
