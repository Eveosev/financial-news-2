BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, urged  Chile  to find ways to increase
electricity supply as the  mining industry  embarks on record
investments to expand production.  While BHP has enough power for its Chilean operations until
2015 and can supply the initial expansion of its Escondida
 copper mine , the company is looking to secure more supplies
after that, the company’s base metals president Peter Beaven
told reporters in Santiago today.  “If we don’t have any power we don’t have any
operations,” Beaven said. “This is a country-wide issue that
needs to be resolved.”  The government of President Sebastian Pinera, who last week
swore in his fifth energy minister in two years, needs to double
power supply in the next decade to match demand growth as mining
companies plan investments totaling $91 billion. BHP will spend
$4.5 billion to expand Escondida, the largest copper mine.  BHP may consider developing a power project it has the
rights to build near Mejillones in northern Chile as a way of
boosting supplies in the Atacama Desert, Beaven said. Boosting
liquefied natural gas imports may also help Chile overcome
energy shortages, he said.  The South American country also needs to train between
50,000 and 60,000 people to work in the mining industry, he
said.  The Melbourne-based company, which owns 57.5 percent of
Escondida, will use desalinated ocean water to run the mine and
plant, Beaven said.  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  owns 30 percent of Escondida,
with the balance held by Japan’s JECO Corp. and JECO 2 Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
