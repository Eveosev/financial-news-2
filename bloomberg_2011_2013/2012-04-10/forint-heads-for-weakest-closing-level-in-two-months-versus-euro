The forint fell to the weakest
against the euro for more than two months on concern the global
economy will slow and  Hungary  will fail to meet conditions to
start talks on an international bailout agreement.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 1 percent to 298.01 by 4:35
p.m. in Budapest, the lowest on a closing basis since Jan. 25.  Investors should sell the forint against the euro because
of Hungary’s “slow” progress toward starting talks on a  credit
line  from the International Monetary Fund and vulnerability to
falling global appetite for risk,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  said today.
U.S. stocks fell after China’s imports missed economists’
forecasts.  “Should risk aversion deteriorate further, the forint
would remain vulnerable and would be hit hard,” Guillaume Tresca, a Paris-based strategist at  Credit Agricole , wrote in an
e-mailed report today. Hungary’s government used its “silver
bullet” asking for the IMF’s help, and “slow progress in talks
could prove to markets that, ultimately, Hungary is not so eager
to negotiate.”  Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  has failed to meet EU
conditions to start talks on a bailout almost five months after
requesting aid. While Hungary has amended laws governing the
judiciary and the data-protecton authority and proposed changes
to central bank regulations to allay European Commission
concerns over their independence, the proposals probably failed
to meet European Union conditions to start aid talks, Mujtaba Rahman, a New York-based analyst at Eurasia Group, said in a
note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
