Hog prices dropped on signs of
increasing supplies of pork in the U.S. Cattle fell to a seven-
month low.  Hog  carcasses  weighed an average 212.35 pounds (96.3
kilograms) on April 6, the highest since at least January 2002,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale  pork  dropped
0.2 percent to 78.41 cents a pound yesterday, USDA data show.
The price has dropped 7.9 percent this year.  “The pork market continues to be soft,”  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “Summer supplies are going to be
up and may be a little bit of an anchor on rallies.”  Hog futures for June settlement declined 0.3 percent to
close at 93.35 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The commodity has gained 11 percent this year.  Cattle futures for June delivery slid 1.3 percent to $1.143
a pound. After the settlement, the price touched $1.14175, the
lowest for a most-active contract since Sept. 2. The price has
dropped 5.9 percent this year.  Wholesale  beef  has dropped 8.3 percent this year, USDA data
show. On April 6, the price touched $1.7761 a pound, the lowest
since Aug. 10, government data show.  “Beef demand overall remains a little lackluster,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in  Chicago ,
said in a note.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 0.5
percent to $1.503 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
