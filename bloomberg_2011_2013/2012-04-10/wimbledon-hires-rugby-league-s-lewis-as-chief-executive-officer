Richard Lewis, chairman of
England’s Rugby Football League, will become chief executive
officer of Wimbledon, the  All England Lawn Tennis Club  said on
its website.  Lewis, a former Davis Cup player for  Great Britain , will
begin his new post May 1. He replaces  Ian Ritchie , who left
Wimbledon in December to become the head of the English Rugby
Football Union.  “As a former tennis professional, the prospect of helping
shape the future of the club and the premier tennis tournament
in the world is one to be relished,” Lewis, 57, said.  Lewis joined the RFL in 2002 and took over as chairman in
2009. He worked for the Lawn Tennis Association from 1987-2000
in a number of roles culminating as its director of tennis.  “We had a very strong field of candidates and in Richard
Lewis we have the person with the right blend of sporting
background and management skill and experience to ensure that
the All  England  Club and The Championships continue to go from
strength to strength,” All England Club Chairman Philip Brook
said.  Lewis played on the professional tour from 1970-84,
reaching his highest world ranking of 68, and was a member of
the British Davis Cup team from 1977-83.  After retiring he spent three seasons as a coach and also
was the manager of Britain’s tennis team at the 1996 Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
