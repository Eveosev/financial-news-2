Dubai benchmark stock index
advanced the most in a week on speculation first-quarter
earnings will beat expectations and after  Air Arabia PJSC (AIRARABI)  raised
dividend payments. Saudi stocks fell for a fifth day.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, increased for the first time in almost a week. Air
Arabia, the  Middle East ’s biggest discount airline, rose 1.8
percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 1.3 percent, the most
since April 3, to 1,678.40 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate.
The measure had lost 2.7 percent the three days through
yesterday.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  was little changed.  “Sentiment is generally strong as earnings expectations
for some of the big companies, including Emaar, are positive,”
said Waleed Al Khateeb, the senior finance manager at Daman
Securities in Dubai. “What we previously saw was a minor
correction. We still have dividends to look forward to.”  Emaar, the company with the  biggest weighting  on Dubai’s
index,  may post  this month a 37 percent surge in first-quarter
profit to 577 million dirhams ($157 million), according to the
median estimate of four analysts on Bloomberg. Emaar gained 0.9
percent to 3.25 dirhams, the first advance since April 4.  Air Arabia’s shareholders approved a 2011 dividend payout
of 6 fils a share, higher than the board’s proposal in February
for a dividend of 4.5 fils. The shares advanced the most since
March 28 to 71.8 fils.  Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index lost 1.9 percent,
bringing the five-day slump to 4.8 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC
200 Index (BGCC200)  decreased 0.7 percent and Bahrain’s  measure  fell 0.4
percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.2 percent, Kuwait’s  Stock
Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  rose 0.5 percent and Oman’s  benchmark stock
index  advanced 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
