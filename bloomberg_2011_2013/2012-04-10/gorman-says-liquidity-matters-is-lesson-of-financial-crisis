Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman  said the “overwhelming lesson” of the
2008 financial crisis for banks is to have assets that can be
sold quickly.  “Liquidity matters more than anything,” Gorman said in an
April 4 interview that was set to air yesterday on public
television’s “Charlie Rose” program. “If you’re going to have
a lot of assets on your balance sheet, they better not be
illiquid. Things get tough, you better be able to find a buyer
for them, and they better be quality assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
