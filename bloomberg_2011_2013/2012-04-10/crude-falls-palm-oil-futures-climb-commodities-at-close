time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials were
unchanged to 1,595.1545.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day in  New York  on speculation U.S.
crude stockpiles rose to the highest level for this time of year
since 1990 and signs  China’s economy  is slowing.  Oil for May delivery fell as much as 62 cents to $101.84 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
and was at $101.88 at 3:45 p.m. Singapore time. The contract
yesterday declined 85 cents to $102.46, the lowest close since
April 4. Prices are up 3.1 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian-marker Dubai
crude fell 40 cents to $15.13 a barrel at noon Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This

ton, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The difference, also
known as the crack spread, widened for the first time in three

banks in the U.S. and  China  may take more steps to spur growth
after data missed estimates, spurring demand for precious
metals. Silver, platinum and palladium rose.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.9 percent to $1,654.90 an
ounce, the highest level in a week, and was at $1,651.83 at 2:24

Holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products were 2,397.577
metric tons yesterday, within 0.6 percent of a March 13 record.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to the lowest level in more than a month
after data showed that China imported less metal in March from a
month earlier, stoking concerns that demand may be weakening in
the world’s largest user.  The metal for delivery in three months fell as much as 1.7
percent to $8,221 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, the
lowest price since March 7, before trading at $8,272.25 by 3
p.m. Shanghai time. The bourse was closed for two days due to
public holidays. Copper for delivery in July on the Shanghai

for the first time in seven months as production fell from a
year earlier. Futures climbed.  Inventories tumbled 5 percent to 1.96 million tons from

and was 14 percent less than a year earlier. Exports rose 10.8
percent to 1.34 million tons, it said.  The June-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.2 percent
to 3,619 ringgit ($1,176) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and was at 3,610 ringgit at 4:09 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .

bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 2:35 p.m. in Singapore.
In China, the world’s largest buyer, the January-delivery

metric ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , the highest price
for the most-active contract since Sept. 5.  Corn for May delivery rose 0.6 percent to $6.5275 a bushel
in Chicago. Wheat for delivery in the same month was little
changed at $6.4275 a bushel.  Rubber declined for a sixth day, the longest streak in more

growth in the U.S. may reduce demand for the commodity used in
tires and gloves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
