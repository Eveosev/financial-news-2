HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  hired  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s Ben Laidler to head research in the Americas,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Laidler, who was head of Latin America strategy at
JPMorgan, will oversee HSBC’s research across all assets in the
Americas, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he isn’t allowed to speak publicly on the matter.
Laidler, who will be based in New York and start in July, joined
JPMorgan in 2007 after working at UBS AG in Santiago.  Juanita Gutierrez, an HSBC spokeswoman in New York,
confirmed the appointment in a telephone interview. Patrick Boucher, HSBC’s current head of research for the Americas, will
continue in the company in a different role, Gutierrez said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
