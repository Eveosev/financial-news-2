Worldwide sales of tablet computers
will almost double to 118.9 million units this year, compared
with 60 million units in 2011, according to a report today from
 Gartner Inc. (IT)   Apple Inc. (AAPL)  will continue to dominate the global market,
with a 61.4 percent share in 2012, even with the arrival of
rival devices from Microsoft Corp. and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) ,
according to the report. Tablets running Google Inc.’s Android
operating system will have a 31.9 percent share, while those
powered by Microsoft’s Windows 8 will account for 4.1 percent of
the market, Gartner forecast.  By 2015, about 35 percent of tablet sales will be for
business use, though most of those purchases will still be made
by consumers rather than by corporations, Gartner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
