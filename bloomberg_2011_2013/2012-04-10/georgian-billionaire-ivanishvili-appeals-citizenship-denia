Billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili has
contested the Georgian Justice Ministry’s refusal to reinstate
his citizenship, his spokeswoman Maya Panjikidze said.  Ivanishvili, a Rossiiskiy Kredit Bank board member whose
wealth Forbes magazine estimates at $6.4 billion, was stripped
of Georgian citizenship on Oct. 11. The ministry on April 4
denied Ivanishvili’s request to restore his citizenship via
naturalization, a category reserved for stateless persons,
because the billionaire holds a French passport.  The ministry said Ivanishvili, a critic of President
Mikheil Saakashvili, could apply again using a different
procedure for dual citizens. Panjikidze ruled out that option.  “Saakashvili took his citizenship away in the first
place,” Panjikidze said by telephone in the capital Tbilisi
today. “Addressing him again now would be illogical.”  On April 5, Ivanishvili said he wants to become  Georgia ’s
next prime minister and will found a political party on April
21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
