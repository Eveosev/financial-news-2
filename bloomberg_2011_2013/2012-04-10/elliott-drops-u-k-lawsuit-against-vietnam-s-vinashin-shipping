Hedge fund Elliott Advisers LP
dropped a U.K. lawsuit against  Vietnam ’s biggest shipbuilder,
lawyers for the state-owned Vietnam Shipbuilding Industry Group
said.  The company, known as Vinashin, and its advisers “were
informed by Elliott’s lawyers, that Elliott wanted to
discontinue the court action,” Mayer Brown LLP, Vinashin’s
lawyers, said today in an e-mail. “No reason was offered by
Elliott to Vinashin for the discontinuance.”  Elliott was suing for the face value on the investment,
which totaled $13.2 million with unpaid interest and default
interest. Vinashin defaulted on the first payment of a $600
million loan in December 2010. It racked up debts of over $4.4
billion.  Eight former Vinashin executives, including the ex-chief
executive officer, were sentenced to prison terms of as much as
20 years at the end of March.  A spokeswoman for Elliott’s lawyers at Bingham McCutchen
LLP in  London  declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
