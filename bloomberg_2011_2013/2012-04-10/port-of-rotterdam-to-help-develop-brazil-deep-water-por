Rotterdam port,  Europe ’s largest,
agreed to help develop a deep-water port in  Brazil ’s Espirito
Santo state that will handle oil products and dry bulk goods.  The port, the state, the municipality of Presidente Kennedy
and developer Terminal Presidente Kennedy yesterday signed a
cooperation agreement to develop Porto Central, the Port of
Rotterdam wrote in a  statement  on its website today.  The first phase is the construction of a 1,000-hectare
(2,471-acre) industrial port in the south of Espirito Santo,
according to the Rotterdam port, which said it will provide
expertise and knowledge on harbor management.  The group will use this year and 2013 to obtain permits and
attract customers, the port wrote. The new port’s business model
is to develop the basic infrastructure and lease property to
terminal operators and other users, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
