Corn futures may open 4 cents to 7
cents a bushel lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after the
government said U.S. inventories as of Aug. 31 will be more than
forecast by analysts, said Mark Schultz, the chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in Minneapolis.  Soybean futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher in Chicago after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
that reserves before the Northern Hemisphere harvest will be
less than forecast last month, Schultz said today in a telephone
interview.  Wheat futures may open 4 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher
as U.S. and global inventories as of May 31 will drop more than
analysts forecast, Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
