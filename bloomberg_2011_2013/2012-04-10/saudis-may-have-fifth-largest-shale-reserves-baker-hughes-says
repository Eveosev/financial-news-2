Saudi Arabia may hold as much as
645 trillion cubic feet of technically recoverable shale gas,
according to an estimate by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   “This number will put Saudi Arabia as the fifth-largest
holder of shale gas behind  China , the U.S., Argentina and
Mexico,” Robert Kennedy, lead petroleum engineer at Baker
Hughes, said today at a Society of Petroleum Engineers
conference in Khobar, Saudi Arabia.  China is the world’s largest holder of technically
recoverable shale gas resources with around 1,275 trillion cubic
feet followed by the U.S. with 862 trillion cubic feet,
according to  estimates  from 32 countries published by the U.S.
Energy Information Administration last year. The study didn’t
include Saudi Arabia.  The kingdom has about 279 trillion cubic feet of proven
conventional gas reserves, according to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.’s
2010 annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
