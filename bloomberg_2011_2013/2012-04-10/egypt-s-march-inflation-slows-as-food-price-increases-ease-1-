Egypt ’s  inflation  rate declined in
March as food prices, one of the causes of the unrest that
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , rose at a slower pace.  The annual inflation rate in urban parts of Egypt, the
gauge the central bank monitors, fell to 9 percent from 9.2
percent in February, the official statistics agency said on its
website today. Prices rose 1.2 percent in the month. Food and
beverage costs, the biggest component of the consumer-price
index, increased 10.9 percent from a year earlier, compared with
12.6 percent in February, it said.  The deceleration is “mainly driven by base effects,”
Mohamed Abu Basha, a Cairo-based economist at EFG-Hermes Holding
SAE, the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank, said in
an e-mailed response to questions before the figures were
published.  Egypt’s economy contracted in 2011 as political instability
deterred investment and tourism. The country has requested a
$3.2 billion loan from the  International Monetary Fund  as it
seeks to end the erosion of  foreign-currency reserves  and revive
growth.  Core inflation  accelerated to an annual 8.68 percent in
March from 7.3 percent in February, the central bank said on its
website today.  The central bank has left its benchmark overnight deposit
rate unchanged at 9.25 percent this year, after a 1 percentage-
point increase in November as it sought to avert a run on the
currency, according to some economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
