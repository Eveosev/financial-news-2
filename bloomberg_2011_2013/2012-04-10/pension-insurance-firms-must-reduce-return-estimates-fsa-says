Firms selling pension and life
insurance products must reduce the estimates of returns they use
to market them by at least 0.5 percent, the U.K. financial
services regulator said today.  The London-based  Financial Services Authority  said firms
must reduce average estimates of a 7 percent rate of return for
investment products that are a mix of equities and bonds to
between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent, based on the results of  a
study  by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The projected returns are
“reasonable central estimates over a 10-15 year time period,”
the report said.  “It is crucial that projection rates are set at a
realistic level so that investors are not misled,” Peter Smith,
head of investments policy at the FSA, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Today’s independent research indicates that our
maximum projection rates should be reduced.”  PwC carried out the last review of so-called projection
rates in 2007, keeping them steady about a year before the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the start of a
financial crisis that would plunge many Western countries into
recession.  “Four years later the economic and market environment has
changed substantially and this presents us with a number of
distinct challenges which were not present in 2007,” the firm
said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
