Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s fourth-biggest airline, fell the most in more than six
weeks as investors took profits following a recent stock jump.  The  stock  retreated as much as 6.3 percent and traded 3.1
percent lower to 12.40 rupees by the end of trading in Port
Louis, the biggest drop since Feb. 24. Shares surged 7.6 percent
yesterday.  Air Mauritius set up a performance improvement committee
and hired Seabury APG, an airline consulting company, to review
its business, it said in a statement to the Mauritius bourse
dated April 3.  “Air Mauritius had a spectacular rise yesterday after
media reports saying that the airline has chosen Seabury APG for
its recovery plan,” said Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at
the city-based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., in a phone interview.
