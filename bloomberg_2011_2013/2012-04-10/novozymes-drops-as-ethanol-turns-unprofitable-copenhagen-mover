Novozymes A/S (NZYMB) , the world’s largest
maker of enzymes used for biofuel, was the second-biggest loser
on Copenhagen’s benchmark index today on concern sales may
suffer after U.S. ethanol production turned unprofitable.  Novozymes fell as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest decline
in the Copenhagen 20 Index after Tryg A/S. Novozymes’ stock
retreated 3.4 kroner, or 2.1 percent, to 161.70 kroner at 9:35
a.m. in the Danish capital.  Novozymes controls almost 60 percent of the U.S. market for
enzymes used in biofuel production, and bioenergy enzymes
accounted for 17 percent of the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based
company’s 2011 revenue. Ethanol futures yesterday fell to the
lowest level in more than a week in Chicago trading.  With gasoline consumption waning, the U.S. is on course to
miss its ethanol target for the first time and producers aren’t
making money at current prices, according to Wallace Tyner, an
agricultural economist at  Purdue University  in  West Lafayette ,
 Indiana . U.S. refiners are required to mix 13.2 billion gallons
of renewable products with motor fuels this year, up 4.8 percent
from last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
