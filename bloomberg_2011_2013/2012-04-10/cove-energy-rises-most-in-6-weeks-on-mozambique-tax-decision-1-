Cove Energy Plc (COV) , the U.K. oil and
gas explorer that offered itself for sale in January, rose the
most in six weeks in London trading after the Mozambique
government clarified taxes applicable in the event of a deal.  Cove climbed 4.2 percent, the most since Feb. 24, to 219
pence by the close.  The company faces a 12.8 percent tax on  capital gains  from
a potential sale, Cove said today in a regulatory statement. Its
main asset is an 8.5 percent interest in a natural-gas block off
Mozambique with as much as 30 trillion cubic feet of the fuel.  “The rate is very good and a lot less than the market was
expecting,” said Gerry Donnelly, an analyst at FirstEnergy
Capital in  London . “The country is in the nascent stages of
developing what could be the biggest gas find of the past
decade. They don’t want to scare away existing players and
future investors.”  PTT Exploration & Production Pcl (PTTEP)  bid 1.1 billion pounds
($1.8 billion) for Cove in February, topping an offer from  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  Cove shares have dropped about 10 percent since
Mozambique’s Mineral Resources Minister Esperanca Bias said
March 1 that the company would face a tax if it’s sold.  “Discussions with possible offerers are ongoing,” London-
based Cove said in the statement. “There can be no certainty
that any offer will be made for the company, nor as to the level
of any proposal or offer that may be made.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
