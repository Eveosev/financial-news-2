Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said
the government will hold ministerial meetings on overcoming
deflation as policy makers explore ways to end more than a
decade of price declines.  Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa will
lead the discussions, Noda said yesterday according to remarks
posted on the website of the prime minister’s office.  Bank of
Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will attend the gatherings as
an observer and the meetings could begin as soon as this month,
the Nikkei newspaper reported, without citing where it obtained
the information.  Lawmakers last week blocked the appointment of BNP Paribas
SA economist  Ryutaro Kono  to the central bank’s board,
highlighting political pressure for Shirakawa’s officials to
ramp up efforts to spur growth and end deflation. Noda’s
announcement came with the BOJ partway through a two-day
monetary policy meeting that ends today.  The government wants to “escape deflation and improve the
economy,” Noda said.  Those attending will also include Jun Azumi, the finance
minister,  Yukio Edano , the minister of economy, trade and
industry,and Shozaburo Jimi, the financial services minister,
according to the Nikkei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
