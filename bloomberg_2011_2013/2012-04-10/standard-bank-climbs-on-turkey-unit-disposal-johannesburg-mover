Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)  gained the
most in two weeks after selling 53 percent of Turkish broker and
investment banking unit Standard Unlu, reducing its ownership to
25 percent.  Shares in  Africa ’s largest lender climbed 1.2 percent, the
most since March 27, to close at 112.60 rand in Johannesburg.  The sale is part of a global strategy which includes
selling assets in Argentina and Russia, according to Martin Botha, a director at  Standard Bank . The lender, which has about
$1 billion in surplus capital after the sale, is trying to
improve the profitability of its Africa operations. Standard
Bank last year said it didn’t plan to sell the Turkish business.  “It’s no surprise given the way Standard Bank has scaled
down London, sold Russia, sold Argentina, that Turkey doesn’t
really fit into the whole Africa-China corridor as such,”
Patrice Rassou, head of equities at Sanlam Investment
Management, said by phone from  Cape Town . “Perhaps the speed is
surprising the market; they are acting so quickly to divest
capital offshore that has been earning very, very low returns,”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
