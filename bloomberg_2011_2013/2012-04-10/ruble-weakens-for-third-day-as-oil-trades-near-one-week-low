The ruble depreciated against the
dollar and the euro for a third day as oil, the country’s chief
export, dropped in  New York .  The Russian currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 29.7425 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after losing 0.2 percent
yesterday. Russia’s 114 billion rubles ($3.8 billion) of local
OFZ bonds due 2021 fell for a fifth day, lifting the yield seven
basis points to 8.01 percent.  Crude futures extended yesterday’s decline of 0.8 percent
and traded 1.4 percent lower at $101.03 a barrel in New York
before a report forecast to show U.S. stockpiles climbed 2
million barrels to 364.4 million last week, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  The ruble was 0.4 percent weaker at 38.90 per euro and lost
0.4 percent to 33.8634 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket. Investors increased bets on the currency
depreciating, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
30.169 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations of
29.9685 per dollar yesterday.  Editors: Peter Branton, Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
