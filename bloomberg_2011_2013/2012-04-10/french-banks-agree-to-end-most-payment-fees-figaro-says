French banks plan to eliminate most
of the interbank fees they charge for automated payments and
transfers by 2014, Le Figaro reported, citing a statement by
 France â€™s competition agency.  In a first step, fees will be cut in half on Oct. 1, and
will be eliminated on Feb. 1, 2014, the newspaper reported.  French banks earned 250 million euros ($327 million) in
fees charged for 471 billion euros in payments from bank
accounts, the newspaper said. The banks chose to eliminate the
fees after the agency concluded they were applying the same rate
without any regard for the costs involved, Figaro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
