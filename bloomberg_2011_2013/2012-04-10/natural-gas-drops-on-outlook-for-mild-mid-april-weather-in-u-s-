Natural gas futures slid to a 10-
year low for a second day as forecasts for mild weather across
the eastern U.S. starting next week signaled reduce fuel demand.  Gas fell as much as 2.5 percent. Temperatures from the
 Mississippi River  to the East Coast will be normal or above
normal from April 15 through April 24, according to MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Unusually mild weather and
record production have driven gas prices to decade lows.  “Until we start to see signs that production levels are
being tapered off or an increase in the seasonal demand factor,
the market is going to skim near the 10-year lows,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  Natural gas for May delivery declined 4.5 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.062 per million British thermal units at 10:51
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas dropped to $2.054
per million Btu, the lowest intraday price since Feb. 6, 2002.  Gas, down 31 percent this year, is the worst performer on
the Standard & Poor’s  GSCI (SPGSCI)  commodity index.  The low temperature in Philadelphia on April 16 will be 57
degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius), 13 above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
 St. Louis  may see a low of 59 degrees, 15 above normal.  Heater Use  Demand for heat in the U.S. will be 12 percent below normal
for the week ending April 17, according to Weather Derivatives.
The Belton, Missouri-based forecaster estimated that demand
during the winter heating season was 18 percent below normal
through April 7.  About 51 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating.
Fuel consumption  typically slumps  after the winter heating
season and before hot weather drives demand from  power plants  to
run air conditioners.  “Significant cooling demand is still several weeks
distant, as well, so selling pressure should continue unabated,
at least for the moment,” Michael Fitzpatrick, a partner at the
Kilduff Group, an energy advisory firm in  New York , said in a
client note today. “The current stream of data on storage,
production and drilling only reinforces expectations for more
downside.”  Gas output from the lower 48 states increased 0.5 percent
in January to 72.85 billion cubic feet a day from the prior
month, the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration
said in its monthly EIA-914 report on March 29. Production rose
every month but one since July as drillers shifted operations to
more profitable liquid-rich shale deposits.  The  number of rigs  drilling for gas fell 11 to 647 last
week, the lowest since May 2002, according to Baker Hughes Inc.
The  oil-rig count  gained by 11 to 1,329, representing 67 percent
of the total, according to the Houston-based oil-services
company.  U.S. stockpiles  totaled 2.479 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended March 30, a record for that time of the year,
according to the Energy Department. A  surplus  of the fuel to the
five-week average widened to 61 percent, the most in six years,
from 59 percent the previous week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
