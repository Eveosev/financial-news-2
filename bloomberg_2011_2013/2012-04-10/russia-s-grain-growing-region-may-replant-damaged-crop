One of  Russia ’s key grain growing
regions in southern Krasnodar should resow 150,000 hectares
(370,650 acres) of winter crops after frost destroyed 8 percent
of the planted area, said Alexander Tkachev, regional governor.  More than 30 percent, or 55,000 hectares, of winter barley
was destroyed by cold weather, Tkachev said yesterday in
Krasnodar, according to a statement on the regional
administration’s website. About half of the rapeseed plantings,
or 26,000 hectares, were ruined due to low temperatures, he
said.  The region plans to sow 2 million hectares of spring crops
this year, he said. Krasnodar harvested about 12 percent of
country’s total grains crop, or 11.4 million metric tons, last
year, according to state statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
