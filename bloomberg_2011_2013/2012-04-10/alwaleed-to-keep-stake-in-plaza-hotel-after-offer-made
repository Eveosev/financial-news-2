Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) , controlled by
Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, plans to retain its
stake in the  Plaza Hotel  after Sahara  India  Pariwar reportedly 
made an offer to buy the New York icon.  “Kingdom isn’t planning on selling at this point in
time,” Charles Henry, a spokesman for the company, said today
in a telephone interview. “The prince’s objective is to be a
long-term investor in this kind of iconic asset.”  Sahara India Pariwar, which bought  London ’s Grosvenor House
luxury hotel in 2010, made a $600 million offer to Israel’s Elad
Group for the Plaza Hotel, India’s Economic Times reported April
6. Kingdom in 2004 sold its stake in the hotel to Elad and
bought back a portion soon after, Henry said.  Kingdom today holds 50 percent of the Plaza’s 130 hotel
rooms and public areas, and 25 percent of the 100 rooms that
were sold as condominiums and rented out as hotel rooms, Henry
said. Kingdom also owns a stake in  Fairmont Hotels & Resorts (FHR) ,
the Plaza’s operator. The hotel, a century-old destination for
socialites and celebrities, reopened in March 2008 after a two-
year restoration that cost more than $400 million.  Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for El-Ad Properties, a unit of
Elad Group and developer of condominiums at the Plaza, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message left after office hours.
Representatives for  Sahara India Pariwar  didn’t immediately
answer an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
