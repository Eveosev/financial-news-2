Gold climbed to a one-week high in
 New York , as concern that  Europe ’s debt sovereign debt woes are
deepening spurred demand for a haven investment.  Spanish and Italian bond yields surged, fueling fears that
the crisis may be worsening. Stocks slid, extending the longest
slump for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index since November and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials declined
as much as 1.5 percent.  “People are now looking at gold as a flight-to-quality
investment rather than a classic commodity in this fear
environment,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at Archer
Financial Services Inc., based in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 1 percent to settle at
$1,660.70 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest jump since March 30. Earlier, prices touched $1,664.80,
the highest since April 3.  Bullion also rose as purchases increased in  India , the
world’s biggest importer, after jewelers ended a 21-day strike,
Klopfenstein said.  Open interest for gold futures contracts fell to 401,018 on
April 5, the lowest since Sept. 1, 2009.  Silver futures for May delivery advanced 0.5 percent to
$31.679 an ounce on the Comex, gaining for the second time in
three sessions.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery fell 1.5 percent to $1,593.70 an ounce, retreating
for the first time in three sessions. Palladium futures for June
delivery declined 1.1 percent to $636.85 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
