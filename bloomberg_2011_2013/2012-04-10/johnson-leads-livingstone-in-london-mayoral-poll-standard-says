London Mayor  Boris Johnson  has a
six percentage-point lead over his main challenger,  Ken Livingstone , before the May 3 mayoral election, the Evening
Standard newspaper reported, citing a ComRes Ltd. poll.  Johnson, a member of Prime Minister David Cameron’s
Conservative Party, had 53 percent support to 47 percent for the
Labour Party’s Livingstone in a choice between the two,
according to the poll, the Standard reported today. Johnson had
an eight point lead in the Standard’s last poll, by  YouGov Plc (YOU) ,
published March 20.  The race has been dominated the past week by a dispute in a
broadcast debate on April 3 in which Johnson accused Livingstone
of being a liar as they argued over whether either had avoided
tax.  The Standard originally reported that Johnson led
Livingstone by 50 percent to 46 percent. It did not say when the
survey of 1,003 Londoners was conducted, nor did it give a
margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
