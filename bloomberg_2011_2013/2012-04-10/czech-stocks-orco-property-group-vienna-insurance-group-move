The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
slipped 0.1 percent to 926.30 by 4:05 p.m. in Prague, after
falling to the lowest in more than two months in the previous
session.  The following are among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)   increased 1.2 percent to
92 koruna, after earlier rising as much as 3.2 percent. The
developer in central Europe overhauling its debt under a court-
approved plan said today its German unit secured an agreement
with bondholders allowing a conversion of bonds into shares.  Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG)   slipped 3.7 percent to
746 koruna, its lowest this year and the worst performance in
the PX benchmark today. Insurers were among the biggest equity
decliners in  Europe  on concern global economic growth is slowing
and after Spain’s plan for additional budget cuts failed to halt
a surge in borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
