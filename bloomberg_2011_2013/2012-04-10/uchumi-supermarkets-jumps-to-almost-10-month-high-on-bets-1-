Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) ,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retail chain, climbed to its highest in
almost 10 months as investors continued to buy the stock on bets
it was oversold.  The shares rose 0.8 percent to 12.95 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the strongest since June 20, after
earlier advancing as much as 2.7 percent.  “There is talk in the market about it being oversold and
now guys are jumping in, that is why it has risen so fast in
three months,” Rufus Mwanyasi, head trader at Nairobi-based
Canaan Capital Ltd., said in a phone interview. “We would
expect some correction in the coming month because a stock
cannot trade in a straight line for so long.”  The shares traded at 6.70 shillings on Dec. 9, the lowest
since at least 1997, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Year-to-date the stock is the best performer on the  Nairobi
Securities Exchange (NSEASI) , having risen 68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
