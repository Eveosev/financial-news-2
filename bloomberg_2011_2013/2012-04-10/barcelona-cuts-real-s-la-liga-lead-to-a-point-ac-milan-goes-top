Barcelona beat Getafe 4-0 to move
to within a point of Real  Madrid  at the top of Spanish soccer’s
La Liga, while AC Milan reclaimed the lead in Italy’s Serie A.  Two goals from  Alexis Sanchez , one from  Pedro Rodriguez  and
Lionel Messi’s 39th league goal of the season at the Camp Nou
last night secured Barcelona’s 10th straight win in La Liga.  Defending champion Barcelona moved to 78 points from 32
games, having trailed Real by 10 points a month ago. The league
leader, which has played 31 games, visits city rival Atletico
Madrid today. Barcelona is scheduled to host Real at the Camp
Nou on April 21.  In other Spanish games last night, sixth-place Osasuna beat
Espanyol 2-0 and Real Betis drew 1-1 at Real Sociedad after
Ruben Castro canceled out  Carlos Vela ’s fourth goal in three
league games.  In Italy, AC Milan moved two points above unbeaten Juventus
atop Serie A as Sulley Muntari’s eighth-minute goal sealed a 1-0
win at ninth-placed Chievo in Verona.  Milan rebounded from a 2-1 home defeat to Fiorentina four
days ago even though it had 14 players missing because of
injuries and suspensions.  Juventus can retake the top spot with a home win against
Lazio today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
