Former  UBS AG (UBSN)  client Wolfgang
Roessel, accused of failing to report more than $11 million in
Swiss accounts to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, will plead
guilty and is helping authorities, a prosecutor said.  Roessel, 72, was charged April 3 with filing a false tax
return and appeared today in federal court in  Fort Lauderdale ,
Florida. Roessel is scheduled to plead guilty next month and pay
a $5.7 million fine, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Kay said.
Roessel, who is retired, ran a company that made cameras, and he
holds several patents, said his lawyer, Lee Stapleton.  U.S. prosecutors have charged nearly 50 U.S. taxpayers with
tax crimes since 2009, when UBS avoided prosecution by paying
$780 million, admitting it helped thousands of Americans evade
taxes and turning over the names of 250 American clients to U.S.
authorities. UBS later revealed another 4,450 accounts.  “This is a UBS spinoff case,” Kay told U.S. Magistrate
Judge Barry Seltzer, who set bail at $100,000.  Roessel, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in  Germany , can
travel internationally and take a planned trip tomorrow to
Germany and Switzerland, Seltzer said.  “He’s been aware he was under investigation for three or
four years now,” Stapleton told Seltzer. She said he had
travelled to  Europe  and voluntarily returned to face the
charges.  The case is United States v. Roessel, 12-cr-60074, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale).  To contact the reporters on this story:
