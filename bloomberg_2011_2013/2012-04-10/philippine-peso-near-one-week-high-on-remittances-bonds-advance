The Philippine peso dropped,
reversing an earlier gain, before a government report this week
that may show export growth slowed in February. Bonds advanced.  Overseas sales increased 1.7 percent in February, compared
with a revised 3.1 percent gain in January, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
data due April 12.  “With export data coming in, the market is wary of driving
the peso higher,” said Lito Mercado, head of trading at  Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. (RCB)  in  Manila .  The peso fell 0.1 percent to 42.84 per dollar at the close
in Manila from April 4, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. Local
markets were shut from April 5 through April 9 for public
holidays. The currency reached 42.75 today, the strongest level
since April 4. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
5.70 percent.  The yield on the  Philippines ’ 5 percent bonds due August
2018 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.83
percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  The government sold 9 billion pesos ($210 million) of five-
year bonds at an average yield of 4.61 percent today, lower than
the 4.67 percent at the last auction of similar-maturity notes
in January 2011, according to the Bureau of the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
