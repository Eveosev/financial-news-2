Mauritius is targeting buyers from
 Hong Kong , Africa and Scandinavian countries for its goods as it
plans to cut reliance on Europe as a trading partner, Enterprise
Mauritius Chief Executive Officer Dev Chumroo said.  The situation for Mauritian exports “remains fragile and
the risks high,” he said in a column published in the Port
Louis-based l’Express newspaper today, citing the crisis in
Europe, the Indian Ocean island nation’s main trading partner,
and “strong competitors.”  Europe purchases 62 percent of Mauritian goods, Chumroo
said. Enterprise Mauritius is a trade promotion organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
