Iran has taken “measures” to
counter a proposed U.S. missile-defense shield in the Persian
Gulf, the  Tehran Times  reported, citing Ali Hajizadeh, the
commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps’ air force.  The defense shield plan is a strategy to ensure security
for Israel, the cost of which would be borne by Muslims,the
newspaper cited Hajizadeh as telling reporters yesterday.  Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
discussed with foreign ministers of Gulf nations, including
Saudi Arabia, the creation of a shared missile-defense system
based on technology from  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  Raytheon Co. (RTN) 
The plan was presented by the U.S. as a means of shielding the
oil-rich region from Iran’s missiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
