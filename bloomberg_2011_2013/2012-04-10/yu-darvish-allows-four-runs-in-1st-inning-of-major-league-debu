Pitcher Yu Darvish struggled in the
first inning of his Major League Baseball debut for the  Texas
Rangers , allowing the Seattle Mariners four runs on four hits --
including a single by Japanese countryman  Ichiro Suzuki .  Darvish also walked Munenori Kawasaki on four pitches with
the bases loaded and threw 42 pitches in the inning. He gave up
three walks and struck out two as the Mariners sent 10 batters
to the plate at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  The Rangers paid a record $51.7 million transfer fee to
Darvishâ€™s Japanese club before signing him to a six-year
contract. Darvish, 25, went 93-38 with a 1.99 earned run average
in seven seasons with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
