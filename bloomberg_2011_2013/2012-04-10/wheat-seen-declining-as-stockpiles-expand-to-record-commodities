Wheat prices are falling for a
second year as a glut of supply expands global stockpiles to an
all-time high and farmers prepare to reap the third-biggest
harvest on record.  Inventories will gain 7.1 percent to 210 million metric
tons this year and output in the next year of 681 million tons
will have been exceeded only twice in history, the London-based
International Grains Council predicts. Prices will average $6.38
a bushel in the fourth quarter, about 5.2 percent below the
December futures contract traded in  Chicago , the median of 10
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.  The crop erased this year’s gains on April 4 on easing
concern that drought in the U.S. and Europe will ruin crops.
Prices have tumbled from as much as $13.495 four years ago as
farmers responded by growing  more grain . The decline is helping
contain global food costs, which remain within about 9 percent
of the all-time high reached 14 months ago, according to a gauge
of 55 commodities  compiled  by the  United Nations .  “Wheat is fundamentally oversupplied,” said Nick Higgins,
a London-based analyst at Rabobank International who expects a
fourth-quarter average of $5.95, which would be the lowest for
the period since 2009. “The concerns over damage to the
European crop are overdone, when you compare them to the supply
glut in the rest of the world.”  Agriculture Index  The commodity retreated 2.9 percent to $6.335 on the
Chicago Board of Trade since the end of December and averaged
$6.44 in the first quarter, 19 percent less than a year earlier.
That compares with a 0.4 percent drop this year in the eight-
member Standard & Poor’s  GSCI (SPGSAG)  Agriculture Index and a 7.6
percent gain in the MSCI All-Country World Index. Treasuries
lost 0.1 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimated yesterday that
world inventories may total 206.27 million tons, 1.6 percent
below last month’s estimate while still the highest in 11 years.
The agency hasn’t released projections for the 2012-2013 global
crop.  Hedge funds  and other speculators have been betting on
lower wheat prices since mid-September, Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. They got more bearish in the week
ended April 3, increasing their net-short position by 2 percent
to 32,017 futures and options contracts, the data show.  Corn Forecast  While the IGC is forecasting a 2.2 percent drop in global
wheat output in the 12 months ending in June 2013, it’s also
anticipating a 1.9 percent gain in total grain supply to a
record 1.876 billion tons, as corn output climbs. The group,
which counts more than 50 nations among its membership, expects
wheat stockpiles to contract 1 percent to 208 million tons by
the end of that season, still the second-highest on record.
Global consumption may rise 0.3 percent to 681 million tons.  Growing conditions in  Europe , which accounts for about 20
percent of global output, still pose a threat to expectations
for  lower prices . Europe will harvest 2.5 percent less winter
wheat because of damage from freezing weather, according to
Offre &  Demande Agricole , a Bourges, France-based farm adviser.
Ukraine’s harvest may drop as low as 10 million tons in the next
marketing year, from 22 million tons a year earlier, Deputy
Agriculture Minister Mykola Bezuhlyi said March 28.  Animal Feed  The slump in prices means wheat is now trading at a 0.4
percent discount to corn, compared with an average premium of 41
percent over the past five years, encouraging substitution in
 animal feed . Farmers globally will use 131.8 million tons of
wheat for feeding livestock in the 12 months ending in June, 14
percent more than a year earlier, the IGC estimates.  Wheat futures on NYSE Euronext in Paris, a European
benchmark, are trading 12 percent  more  than Chicago, compared
with an average of 4.6 percent over the past five years, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That may spur more demand for supply
from the U.S., the biggest exporting nation, eroding domestic
inventories and driving prices higher.  “We’re still bullish on wheat,” said  Michael Haigh , the
New York-based global head of commodities research at Societe
Generale SA, which expects a fourth-quarter average of $7.80.
“The three main themes are the substitution effect, weather
problems in Europe that are still not resolved, and the fact
that U.S. wheat prices are still very competitive.”  Wheat Surplus  The U.S. wheat surplus on May 31 will probably be 793
million bushels (21.6 million tons), down from 862 million
bushels a year earlier and an estimate of 825 million last
month, the USDA said yesterday. That may be met with increasing
supply, with farmers planting the most acres since 2009, the
USDA said March 30. U.S. wheat output may rise 8.3 percent to
2.165 billion bushels, the USDA said Feb. 24.  Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop by value after corn,
soybeans and hay. A more than doubling in the S&P GSCI
Agriculture Index in the past six years helped generate record
farm  income  of $98.1 billion in 2011 and pushed the value of
farmland to an all-time high of $2,350 an acre, USDA data show.  Declining European output may also be offset by  supply  from
 Russia . Its grain harvest may total about 94 million tons, near
last year’s output and 54 percent more than in 2010 when drought
decimated crops, President-elect  Vladimir Putin  said March 28.
Wheat made up 60 percent of the grain crop last year.  Farmer Plans       Demand (US46COWR)  for wheat in livestock feed may also weaken as
farmers produce a record corn crop. Global corn output will
advance 4.2 percent to 900 million tons in the 12 months ending
in June 2013, the IGC estimates. U.S. farmers may plant 95.86
million acres of corn this season, the most since 1937, the USDA
said March 30.  The glut of corn will probably drive most grain prices
lower, said Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in
 London , who expects wheat to average $5.60 in the fourth quarter
and $5.20 in the following three months. The use of wheat in
feed will drop 7.4 percent in 2012-13, Rabobank estimates. Corn
for December delivery closed today at $5.4675 a bushel on the
CBOT, 14 percent less than supply for May.  “Overall supplies of wheat are looking relatively
comfortable,” said Amy Reynolds, a London-based senior
economist with the IGC. “There’s still plenty of time for there
to be a very good crop.”  ----With assistance from Rudy Ruitenberg in Paris,  Jeff Wilson
