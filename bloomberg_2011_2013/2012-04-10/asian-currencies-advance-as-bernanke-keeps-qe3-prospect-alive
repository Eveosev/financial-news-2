India ’s rupee led losses in Asian
currencies as data showed  China ’s imports slowed more than
economists estimated, dimming the outlook for the region’s
exports.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar  Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen, fell to this
month’s lowest level. Shipments to Asia’s biggest economy rose
5.3 percent in March from a year earlier, figures from China’s
customs bureau showed, compared with a 9 percent gain estimated
by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The MSCI  Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP) 
of stocks slumped for a fifth day as  Japan  refrained from
expanding monetary stimulus.  “China’s trade figures may have looked positive at a
glance, but a deeper analysis led to doubts about economic
growth, prompting some investors to buy the dollar,” said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-based currency trader at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group.  The rupee fell 0.4 percent to 51.33 per dollar as of 3:20
p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. South
Korea’s won lost 0.1 percent to 1,139.70, Malaysia’s ringgit
dropped 0.2 percent to 3.0777 and China’s yuan slipped 0.05
percent to 6.3115. Indonesia’s rupiah dropped 0.4 percent to
9,183, after gaining as much as 1.5 percent earlier.  China including  Hong Kong  is the biggest export market for
economies including Malaysia, Taiwan and  South Korea . Premier
Wen Jiabao cut this year’s growth target to 7.5 percent in
March, from an 8 percent goal in place since 2005.  Slowing Demand  “The underlying message is that domestic demand is still
slowing” in China,  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist at HSBC
Holdings Plc in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note today.
Growth in the world’s second-largest economy will slow before
bottoming out in the second quarter, he wrote.  The  U.S. economy  is still “far from having fully
recovered” from the effects of the global financial crisis,
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday. A Labor
Department report on April 6 showed hiring by American employers
in March amounted to 120,000, trailing the most-pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The ringgit fell, reversing a 0.4 percent advance, before a
public holiday tomorrow. Official data showed today exports rose
14.5 percent in February from a year earlier, following a 0.4
percent gain the previous month. Industrial production increased
7.5 percent, compared with 0.3 percent in January.  North Korea  Korea’s won fell to the lowest level since March 26 after
an intelligence report showed North Korea may test a nuclear
weapon after a planned missile launch between April 12 and 16.
Financial markets are closed tomorrow in Seoul for a holiday.  “Concerns over North Korea will prevent the won from
strengthening, but with the holiday tomorrow, not many traders
will be betting aggressively on a weaker won,” Kim Doo Hyun, a
Seoul-based currency dealer at  Korea Exchange Bank. (004940)   Elsewhere, the Philippine peso weakened 0.1 percent to
42.84 per dollar as markets opened for the first time since
April 4. The Thai baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.93 from its close
on April 5. Taiwan’s dollar and Vietnam’s dong were steady at
NT$29.57 and 20,833, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
