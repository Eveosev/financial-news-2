Ethanol futures declined for a
second day in  Chicago  after a government report signaled lower
production costs and on concern that the euro-region debt crisis
will spread.  The biofuel fell after the Agriculture Department said corn
inventories will be 801 million bushels Aug. 31, above the 715
million forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Futures for corn,
the primary feedstock in U.S.-made ethanol, fell. Spanish and
Italian bond yields surged, fueling speculation of a worsening
debt crisis.  “Just overall we had macro-driven selling,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.
“We also had the big report today out on corn.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 3.3 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $2.229 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since March 29. Futures have gained 1.2
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 2
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.26 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.205,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast declined 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.37 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped
0.5 cent to $2.30.  Corn futures for May delivery slid 14.25 cents, or 2.2
percent to close at $6.3475 a bushel in Chicago, the biggest
drop since March 29.  Gasoline for May delivery tumbled 4.71 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $3.2496 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract includes reformulated
gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
