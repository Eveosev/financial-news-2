Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ,  India ’s biggest
producer of the alloy, said profitability at its local unit
should improve in the fourth quarter ended March 31 on higher
sales and prices.  Steel demand in India may rise after the nation’s central
bank indicated a pro-growth monetary policy, Tata Steel said in
an investor presentation posted on its  website . The company
expects its loss-making European unit to register better margins
in the coming quarters following a surge in prices and purchases
by customers.  Indian steelmakers, including Tata Steel, have increased
prices of long products, used in construction projects, by 8
percent this year. Tata Steel’s sales volume in the fiscal
fourth quarter rose 3.3 percent to 1.77 million metric tons, the
Mumbai-based company said in an e-mailed statement on April 9.  Tata Steel  shares  fell 1.5 percent to 452.80 rupees at
close in Mumbai. The stock gained 35 percent this year, compared
with a 12 percent increase in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  The  Reserve Bank  of India left its repurchase rate at 8.5
percent, the highest level since 2008, for a third straight
meeting on March 15. It signaled future cuts to bolster slowing
growth, while flagging inflation risks, including the fiscal
deficit,  oil prices  and rupee depreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
