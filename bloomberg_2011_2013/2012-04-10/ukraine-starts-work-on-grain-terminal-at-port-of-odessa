Ukraine started building a grain
terminal at Odessa on the Black Sea coast to increase export
capacity, the Ministry of Transport said.  Itâ€™ll be the fourth grain terminal in the port at Odessa,
the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. The port will
invest $40 million in the $125 million project, according to the
ministry. Odessa-based Brooklyn-Kiev Ltd. will fund the rest,
according to the statement.  The port will be able to ship 4 million metric tons of
grain a year, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
