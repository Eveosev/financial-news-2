3W Power SA (3W9) , the holding company
that owns the German maker of solar inverters AEG Power
Solutions, declined the most since it sold shares to the public
after saying a takeover attempt by Andrem Power SCA won’t
proceed.  Germany ’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, BaFin,
has prohibited the publication of the offer document filed by
Andrem Power, the company said in a statement on April 5. Andrem
Power, indirectly owned by private-equity firm Nordic Capital
Ltd., had offered 4.35 euros for each 3W Power share.  3W Power fell 48 percent to 2.21 euros in Frankfurt, the
biggest drop since July 2008, giving the company a market value
of 123.9 million euros ($162.1 million).  3W Power reiterated that  sales  will be in a range of 430
million euros to 460 million euros this year, while earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will be 9
percent to 11 percent of sales.  Christiane Doehler, a spokeswoman for 3W Power, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. Wigan Salazar, a spokesman
for Andrem Power, said BaFin had asked for changes to the
takeover offer that would have made it impossible to honor the
contract. Salazar declined to provide details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
