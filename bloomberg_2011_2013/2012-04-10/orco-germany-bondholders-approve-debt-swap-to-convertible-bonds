Orco Property Group SA (ORC)  climbed the
most in more than two months in French trading after the
developer in central  Europe  said its German unit secured an
agreement with bondholders to convert debt into shares.  The stock rose as much as 21 percent, the biggest intraday
advance since Feb. 3, and traded up 11 percent to 3.74 euros by
2:47 p.m. in Paris.  Bondholders in Orco Germany SA voted last week to swap
100.1 million euros ($131 million) of debt to notes convertible
into shares, the parent company, which is overhauling its debt
under a court-approved plan, said today in a statement.  In Prague trading, Orco added as much as 3.2 percent before
retreating 1 percent to 90 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
