Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully
will miss the  Los Angeles  Dodgers’ home opener for just the
second time in 63 years because of a bad cold, according to the
Major League Baseball team.  Scully’s tenure as a Dodgers commentator is the longest in
sports-broadcasting history, according to the team’s media
guide. He is resting at home and will be unavailable for today’s
game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the Dodgers said in a
statement.  Charley Steiner and Steve Lyons will call the game on
television, and Rick Monday will handle the duties for radio.  Scully called the Dodgers’ season-opener in San Diego on
April 5.  The only other Dodgers home opener that the 84-year-old
Scully missed since joining the team was in 1977, when he was
calling golf’s  Masters Tournament  on  network television ,
according to ESPN.com. Scully started with the Dodgers in
Brooklyn, New York, and moved with the franchise to Los Angeles
in 1958.  Scully was elected to the news media wing of the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. He called the perfect games
thrown by  Don Larsen  in 1956, Sandy Koufax in 1965 and Dennis
Martinez in 1991, as well as 19 no-hitters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
