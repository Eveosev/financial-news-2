Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-largest producer, will harvest less than
previously forecast after dry weather damaged crops in the
country’s south, the government said.  The outlook for the crop year that started Sept. 1 was cut
to 65.6 million metric tons from 68.7 million tons estimated on
March 8, the Agriculture Ministry’s crop-forecasting agency,
known as Conab, said in a report today. Production will fall
from 75.3 million tons in the previous crop year.  The forecast for corn output was raised to 65.1 million
tons from 61.7 million tons. Brazil, the world’s third-largest
grower of the grain, produced 57.4 million tons of corn in the
previous crop year.  The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of soybeans and
corn.  China  is the world’s second-biggest corn grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
