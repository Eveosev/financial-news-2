Spanish home sales declined the
most in six months in February as the euro areaâ€™s fourth-largest
economy relapsed into a  recession  and banks reduced lending.  The number of  transactions  fell 31.8 percent from a year
earlier, the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid  said in an
e-mailed statement today. That was the most since August, and
compares with a decline of 26.3 percent in January.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December, is
struggling to turn around a slump in the real estate industry as
banks squeeze lending at a record pace and unemployment exceeds
23 percent. The government has brought back tax breaks for home
buyers and is forcing banks to recognize deeper losses on 175
billion euros ($229 billion) of real estate assets in an attempt
to accelerate sales and push down  home prices .  To contact the reporter on this story:
