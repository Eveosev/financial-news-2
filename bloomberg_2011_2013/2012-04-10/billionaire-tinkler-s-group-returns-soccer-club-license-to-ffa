Billionaire Nathan Tinkler’s Hunter
Sports Group said it’s returning Newcastle Jets’ A-League soccer
license to Football Federation  Australia , which said it will not
accept the termination.  Tinkler’s sports management group, which acquired the Jets
in September 2010, said it made the decision because it has been
“unable to resolve a variety of issues with the FFA,”
including a A$5 million ($5.1 million) acquisition fee.  “Having lost confidence in the FFA management and its
ability to find a resolution, it is clear we have no other
option,” Troy Palmer, chief executive officer of Hunter Sports
Group, said in a  statement . “It is about removing ourselves
from an administration in which we have an untenable
relationship.”  The 36-year-old Tinkler, an electrician-turned-miner who is
Australia’s youngest billionaire, had stepped in to rescue the
Jets after the FFA withdrew the license of former owner Con
Constantine because the 2008 A-League champion ran out of money
to pay players and stadium fees.  The Sydney-based FFA, which last week announced plans for a
new A-League team in Sydney’s western suburbs, said it doesn’t
accept that Hunter Sports Group has the right to return the
Jets’ license and expects the club to honor its A-League
participation agreement, which runs through June 2020.  “The obligation is clearly upon the Hunter Sports Group to
live up to its commitments, live up to its contract, pay the
players, pay the coaches and continue to operate the team,” FFA
Chief Executive Officer Ben Buckley said at a news conference.
“We’ll be speaking with our lawyers, taking advice. We’ll be
writing to them that we do not accept the termination and that
they should live up to the commitments that have been made.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
