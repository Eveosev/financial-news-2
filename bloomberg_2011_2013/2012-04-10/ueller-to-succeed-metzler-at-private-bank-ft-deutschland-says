Friedrich von Metzler plans to
gradually transfer the leadership of German  private bank  B.
Metzler Seel. Sohn & Co. KGaA to Emmerich Mueller, Financial
Times Deutschland reported, citing an interview with the
bankers.  All the Frankfurt-based bank’s divisions performed better
last year than in 2010, the newspaper said, citing Mueller, the
only owner of the bank with personal liability apart from von
Metzler.  While they may be a period where no member of the von
Metzler family is among the bank’s partners, Leonhard von Metzler, 36, may be accepted as one in the future, FT
Deutschland said in an e-mailed summary of an article to be
published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
