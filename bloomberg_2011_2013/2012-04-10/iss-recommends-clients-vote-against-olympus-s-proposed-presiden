ISS Proxy Advisory Services
recommended that its clients reject  Olympus Corp. (7733) ’s proposed
appointment of Hiroyuki Sasa as president, saying he lacks the
right experience to lead the company after a $1.7 billion fraud.  “Sasa’s work experience does not appear appropriate” to
head Olympus “at a time when the firm is faced with enormous
tasks ranging from restructuring and financial stabilization to
restoration of investor trust,” ISS said in a report published
April 6.  The recommendation may prompt investors to reject Olympus’s
February proposal for an 11-member board to replace President
Shuichi Takayama and other directors after the company admitted
to a 13-year cover-up of investment losses. Shareholders will
vote April 20 on nominees including Sasa, head of marketing at
Olympus’s medical systems unit, and Yasuyuki Kimoto, a former
executive at main creditor  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) 
who has been nominated as chairman.  ISS said investors should vote against Kimoto because of
concerns that bank interests will be prioritized over
shareholder interests.  Southeastern Asset Management Inc., Harris Associates LP
and seven other shareholders of Olympus said last month that
Olympus’s board nominees may have a conflict of interest because
of their ties to creditors.  The proposed board hasn’t laid out its strategic vision,
making it hard for shareholders to evaluate Sasa’s leadership,
ISS said.  Separately, Japan Proxy Governance Institute said it
supported the proposed appointment of Kimoto as chairman and
Sasa as president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
