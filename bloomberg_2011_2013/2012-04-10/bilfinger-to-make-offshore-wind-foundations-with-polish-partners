Bilfinger Berger SE (GBF) , a German
builder, started a 50 million-euro ($66 million) joint venture
with two Polish companies to make foundations for offshore  wind
turbines  as demand in the North and Baltic seas grows.  Bilfinger Berger will make steel support structures for 80
turbines a year from 2014 at the Gryfia production site in the
Polish port of Szczecin, the Mannheim-based company said today
in a  statement . It will work with Crist SA, a Gdansk-based steel
construction company, and MARS, a state-owned investment fund.  Europe ’s northern coastal nations are adding wind farms to
meet energy demand without boosting emissions. Poland could host
as much as 10,000 megawatts in the  Baltic Sea , the Polish
Offshore Wind Energy Society said in February.  Germany , phasing
out nuclear in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, is targeting
the same amount by 2020 in the German  North Sea  and the Baltic,
while Denmark  aims  to get half its power from wind by that time.  The number of turbines installed annually in those regions
must increase “significantly” for nations to reach climate
protection goals, Bilfinger Berger said in the statement.  The Gryfia facility will employ more than 400 people and
process 80,000 metric tons of steel a year, according to the
statement. Bilfinger Berger owns a 62.5 percent share in the
venture, Crist has 25 percent and MARS the remainder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
