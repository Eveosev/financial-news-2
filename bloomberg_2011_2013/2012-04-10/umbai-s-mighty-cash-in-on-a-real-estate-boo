"In Mumbai, property is destiny," the novelist Vikram Chandra, author of the huge fictional investigation into the city's hidden vortexes of power " Sacred Games ," once said to me. Of course, every one of the 20 million or so denizens of the  space-starved Indian financial capital  knows and feels (and dreams) this truth, but the city's extortionate real estate prices and lamentable urban planning mean that more than half of its industrious population lives and suffers in slums, while hundreds of thousands of middle-class people expend their energies on debilitating journeys on jam-packed trains and buses from homes in the distant suburbs. But more than the average Mumbaikar, more even than the city's sizeable class of entrepreneurs and investors, it is Mumbai's politicians (and those of Maharashtra, the state in whose crown  Mumbai  is the jewel) and its bureaucracy that might be said to hold this mantra closest to their hearts. Over the last two decades, as India's liberalization has spurred an economic boom and made some sections of the country flush with capital, no business in Mumbai has grown so rapidly as the business of property, and no partnership has generated so much intrigue and malfeasance as that of the  nexus between the city's politicians and builders . Simultaneously, as an  exhaustive report  in a recent issue of the investigative weekly Tehelka showed, politicians in power have worked assiduously at capturing real estate by  leasing or transferring land held by the government at highly subsidized rates  to "trusts" run by themselves or family members, thereby turning public goods into private wealth and draining the city of much-needed investments in roads, parks, hospitals, and schools. The extent to which this corruption is no longer individual but systemic, built into the very structures of the city's economy, political parties, government, and laws (and periodic amendments to those laws) is no secret to Mumbaikars. But its secrets, deceptions and compromises are by and large well-managed and contained by those who perpetrate them. Every now and then, though, the persistence of an isolated journalist or activist pays off, and the curtain falls away from the truth, toppling those at the very top. Last week, after a  series of arrests  of high-profile bureaucrats, including that of the former municipal commissioner of Mumbai, in a housing scam, newspapers were  abuzz with speculation  that a really big fish -- the state's previous chief minister,  Ashok Chavan , himself the son of a former chief minister of the state --  might be arrested . In November 2010, Chavan, then the incumbent chief minister (and holder of the coveted urban development portfolio), lost his job after his complicity in the  Adarsh Housing Society  scam was revealed. The details of this audacious land grab provide a revealing snapshot of how power beds itself down in modern India through networks of patronage, and even straight barter. In 2003, the Maharashtra government passed a proposal to construct a six-story building in Colaba, one of Mumbai's most expensive neighborhoods, offering flats at concessional rates to veterans of the  Kargil war  of 1999 with  Pakistan , or their widows. Many suspicious aspects of the project were queried as far back as 2003 by the journalist Samar Halarnkar in the  Indian Express , but to no avail. By the end of the decade, the building had come up, but it was now 31 floors high, the many clearances it needed having been expedited swiftly by a compliant bureaucracy. But it housed only a handful of soldiers. The rest of the flats had been parceled up between politicians (in both government and opposition), their proxies, and bureaucrats in the state government. As a  who's who  of the residents of the building published by the Indian Express showed, almost everyone who had contributed to the building project being passed had been rewarded with a prime address in the city. Every chief minister of Maharashtra of the past decade (including the notorious  Vilasrao Deshmukh , now taking a breather in the union government from the frying pan of Maharashtra politics) had some involvement with the project, and stood to benefit in return. The Deccan Herald reported in a piece called " Maharastra's Land Scandals ": So where do the surpluses generated by such sweetheart deals go? Certainly into the election war-chests of political parties, and perhaps into Swiss bank accounts. But, most damagingly, they perhaps go into the subversion of democracy, and  fund the corruption  of the public sphere. It is surely not a coincidence that Chavan's tenure as chief minister marked not just a new chapter in the history of crony capitalism in the city, but also, as a scathing series of reports by the journalist P. Sainath during the Maharashtra elections of 2009 proved, a new era for the capital-intensive phenomenon of " paid news " -- articles published on the eve of elections praising the incumbent chief minister. And just as significantly, such collusions, if they go unpunished, vitiate the reputation and professed ideals of capitalism itself far more than any critics on the left could, and demonstrate what a great gulf may lie between "free" and "just," when capitalism's votaries often think of the second word as virtually synonymous with  the first. It is indisputable that the energies of capitalism have worked wonders  in the last two decades  in transforming the static and oppressively hierarchical  India  of old. But simultaneously, capitalism's disregard for its own professed rules has greatly skewed access to the wealth it has generated, and supplied damning data to its critics, while suggesting even to those who are new to its ways -- as most young Indians are -- that it is a system that depends more on access than on efficiency. As the historian Joyce Appleby argues in her history of capitalism, " The Relentless Revolution ," “the shape and direction of capitalism are always set by its participants and never by inexorable laws” -- although economic determinists would have us believe that they are. All too often in India today, as examples like Adarsh prove, political power is thoroughly compromised by its proximity to special interests and lobbies, and capitalism's participants don't make a good enough case for the legitimacy of the system. In the case of Mumbai, the politician-builder nexus has condemned its citizens to a vastly poorer life than they deserve, and the parallel lines of genuine capitalism and crony capitalism have spawned a double economy. As an editorial titled " A Profitable Partnership " in The Economic and Political Weekly pointed out: Can things change at all when both government and opposition in Maharashtra are deeply invested in the politics of property -- capture, development,  slum rehabilitation  and redistribution? In a long investigative essay in Tehelka last May called " Land Grab. And How To Make Millions " -- required reading for anybody interested in Indian politics -- the journalist Ashish Khetan supplied indictments of dozens of prominent Maharashtra politicians: In a sense, then, no Indian city is as great a symbol of the exhaustion of democracy and the takeover of policy by special interests as Mumbai,  historically a city of entrepreneurship and public-spiritedness . Returning to the city -- the one I know best and love best, and the place where my own stories are set -- late one night last week after a couple of months away, I found it looking, even at midnight, weary, ill-lit, dusty, and dystopian, the roads littered with construction debris and garbage, and hundreds of people sleeping on the pavements or beneath flyovers. I found myself remembering the close of Cyrus Guzder's  excellent essay  about the city from 2003: (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
