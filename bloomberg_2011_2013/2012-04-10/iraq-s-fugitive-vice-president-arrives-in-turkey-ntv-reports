Iraqi Vice President Tariq al- Hashimi, the top Sunni Muslim politician whom authorities in
 Baghdad  are seeking to jail on terrorism charges, arrived in
 Turkey  last night, NTV news channel  reported  on its website.  Hashimi flew to Istanbul from Qatar, where the minister of
state in charge of foreign affairs refused an extradition
request from Iraq, according to the Istanbul-based television
channel. Khalid Bin Mohamed Al Attiyah told reporters that
Hashimi is a visiting statesman who hasn’t been relieved of his
duties or sentenced for a crime, NTV reported. Hashimi
previously fled to  Iraqi Kurdistan  in the north.  Turkey has called efforts by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al- Maliki, a Shiite formerly exiled in Iran, to arrest Hashimi
“unacceptable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
