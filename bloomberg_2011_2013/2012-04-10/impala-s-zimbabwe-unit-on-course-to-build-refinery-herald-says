Zimplats Holdings Ltd. (ZIM) ,  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) ’s unit in Zimbabwe, is on course to set
up a platinum refinery in that country, the Herald reported,
citing Zimplats Deputy Chairman Muchadeyi Masunda.  Including  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) ’s Unki mine and
Mimosa, Impala’s joint venture with Aquarius Platinum Plc,
Zimbabwe currently produces less than the 500,000 ounces needed
to establish a refinery, the Harare-based newspaper cited
Masunda as saying. Zimplats’ output will increase to 270,000
ounces from 180,000 ounces, while Mimosa has plans to ramp up
production to 200,000 ounces from 100,000 ounces now, the Herald
reported.  Management at the Unki operation has indicated plans to
increase output to 150,000 ounces, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
