“A significant disconnect”
between stock valuations and bond yields in the U.S. has made
equities relatively cheap, according to Binky Chadha, Deutsche
Bank AG’s chief global strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the comparison he used to reach
this conclusion. The projected price-earnings ratio for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as compiled by Bloomberg, is
depicted along with the yield on 10-year Treasury notes.  Ten-year yields would have to rise about 120 basis points
to track the estimated P/Es as they did during the first three
quarters of 2011, Chadha wrote in an April 5 report. Each basis
point amounts to 0.01 percentage point. The government security
yielded 2.04 percent as of yesterday.  The differential primarily reflects the  Federal Reserve ’s
plan to keep its benchmark  interest rate  close to zero at least
through late 2014, in his view.  “The Fed’s outlook for unemployment and inflation is
therefore key” in determining when the gap might close, Chadha
wrote. Policy makers for the central bank are scheduled to meet
on April 24-25.  Stocks are a bargain with the  S&P 500  at about 13 times
analysts’ projected earnings for this year, the New York-based
strategist wrote. He cited a December report in which he called
the index fairly valued at 15.4 times future profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
