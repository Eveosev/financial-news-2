  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell the most in a week after a report showed on April 6
that U.S. employers added fewer jobs than expected, damping the
outlook for recovery in the world’s biggest economy.  The shares, which didn’t trade during on April 6 and 9
because of the Easter holiday, declined 1.6 percent to 3,689
forint by 9:11 a.m. in Budapest.  “European markets may react today to the American data
published on Friday and the direction can hardly be in
question,” Balint Torok and Gergely Palffy, analysts at Buda-
Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
