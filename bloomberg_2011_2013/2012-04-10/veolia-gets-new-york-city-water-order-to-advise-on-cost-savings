Veolia Environnement SA (VIE)  said it
will advise  New York City  on how to lower operating costs of
water and wastewater services to 9 million people.  The New York City Department of Environmental Protection
could achieve annual savings of between $100 million and $200
million on operating and maintenance costs, according to a
statement from the Paris-based water company.  The four-year contract could be worth $36 million in sales
for the utility, Veolia said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
