Derek Jeter had four hits as the
 New York Yankees  won their first game of the season. Daniel Murphy singled in the winning run in the ninth inning and the
New York Mets extended their perfect start to four games.  The Boston Red Sox and  San Francisco  Giants joined the
Yankees by winning for the first time in 2012. The Atlanta
Braves and Minnesota Twins lost again and are the only 0-4 teams
in  Major League Baseball .  Yu Darvish settled down after a four-run first inning to
win his pitching debut for the Texas Rangers. He gave up three
hits to Japanese countryman Ichiro Suzuki in an 11-5 win against
the Seattle Mariners.  Andruw Jones  hit a solo home run and Ivan Nova allowed two
runs in seven innings to get the win in the Yankees’ 6-2 defeat
of the Orioles at Camden Yards in Baltimore, allowing the
Yankees to avoid their first 0-4 start since 1973.  The Mets are the only 4-0 team in MLB after a 4-3 home win
against the Washington Nationals. It’s the first time since 2007
that they have won four games to open a season.  The  Red Sox  scored three runs in the ninth inning to win 4-
2 at Toronto. The Giants got their first win when Barry Zito
pitched a four-hitter in a 7-0 defeat of the Colorado Rockies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
