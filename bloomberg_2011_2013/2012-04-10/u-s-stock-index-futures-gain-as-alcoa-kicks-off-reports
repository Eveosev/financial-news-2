U.S. stocks declined for a fifth
straight day, giving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its longest
losing streak since November, as a surge in Spanish and Italian
bond yields fueled concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  The  Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index (CYC)  of companies most-
dependent on the economy lost 2.7 percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  dropped at least 3 percent.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) ,
which declined 2.9 percent in regular trading, jumped 5 percent
at 4:25 p.m. New York time after reporting an unexpected profit.
 Best Buy Co. (BBY) , the world’s largest electronics retailer, slumped
5.9 percent as Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dunn  resigned.  The S&P 500 declined 1.7 percent to 1,358.59, its biggest
loss in 2012, at 4 p.m. New York time. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  retreated 213.66 points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,715.93.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index surged 8.4
percent to 20.39, rallying for a  record  eighth day. More than
8.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, the most
since March 16 and 21 percent above the three-month average.  “I don’t think there’s any rush to be involved in the
stock market,” James Swanson, who oversees about $250 billion
as chief investment strategist at Boston-based  MFS Investment
Management , said in a telephone interview. “ Europe  is a
temporary concern. The market is signaling they haven’t fixed
the whole problem. Investors will need more reassurance.”  Stocks fell as Spanish bonds slumped after Economy Minister
Luis de Guindos declined to rule out a rescue and Bank of Spain
Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said the nation’s
lenders may need more capital if the economy weakens more than
expected. The Italian 10-year yield rose 23 basis points to 5.69
percent, sending the spread over bunds to 4.04 percentage
points, the most since Jan. 31 on a closing basis.  50-Day Average  Today’s decline sent the S&P 500 below its average price in
the past 50 days of about 1,372. The index, which has dropped
4.3 percent in five days, retreated 1.1 percent yesterday after
an April 6 report showed employers added fewer jobs than
forecast in March. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
yesterday said the  U.S. economy  hasn’t fully recovered.  “Friday’s disappointing report has eroded investor
confidence about America’s self-sustaining ability to overcome
headwinds from Europe,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an e-mail.  Investors also awaited the start of the first-quarter
earnings season. While per-share  profit growth  slowed to 0.8
percent from 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, it will
accelerate to 8.3 percent during all of 2012, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Biggest Losses  All  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  declined today as consumer
discretionary, financial and industrial shares had the biggest
losses. The Dow Jones Transportation Average retreated 2.1
percent. A measure of 11 homebuilders in S&P indexes slumped 4.8
percent. The KBW Bank Index dropped 2.3 percent as all of its 24
stocks declined.  Bank of America  slipped 4.4 percent, the most
in the Dow, to $8.54. Caterpillar fell 3 percent to $100.43.  Alcoa, the first company in the Dow to report quarterly
results, lost 2.9 percent to $9.32. The shares rose 5 percent to
$9.79 after the close of regular trading. The largest U.S.
aluminum producer reported an unexpected first-quarter profit as
customers from automakers to beverage-can manufacturers ordered
more of the metal.  Net income fell to $94 million, or 9 cents a share, from
$308 million, or 27 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Earnings excluding restructuring costs and
other items were 10 cents a share, compared with the 4-cent loss
that was the  average  of 19 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales increased to $6.01 billion from $5.96 billion.
The average of 12 estimates was for $5.77 billion.  Best Buy  Best Buy slumped 5.9 percent to $21.32 after saying board
member G. Mike Mikan is taking the CEO position on an interim
basis as the company focuses on smaller stores and  Internet
sales . The change was a “mutual agreement” that new leadership
was needed, the company said. A committee of directors has been
created to search for a new CEO, the company said.  PPL Corp. (PPL)  declined 2.2 percent to $27.06. The energy and
utility holding company will sell 9.9 million shares in a public
offering.  Supervalu Inc. (SVU)  surged 15 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $6.13. The supermarket and pharmacy chain forecast 2013
earnings excluding some items of at least $1.27 a share, beating
the average analyst forecast of $1.19.  “A significant disconnect” between stock valuations and
bond yields in the U.S. has made equities relatively cheap,
according to Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank AG’s chief global
strategist.  Price-Earnings  Ten-year Treasury yields would have to rise about 120 basis
points to track the estimated price-earnings ratio for the S&P
500 as they did during the first three quarters of 2011, Chadha
wrote in an April 5 report. Each basis point amounts to 0.01
percentage point. The government security yielded 2.04 percent
as of yesterday.  The differential primarily reflects the  Federal Reserve ’s
plan to keep its benchmark  interest rate  close to zero at least
through late 2014, in his view.  “The Fed’s outlook for unemployment and inflation is
therefore key” in determining when the gap might close, Chadha
wrote. Policy makers for the central bank are scheduled to meet
on April 24-25.  Stocks are a bargain with the S&P 500 at about  13 times 
analysts’ projected earnings for this year, the New York-based
strategist wrote. He cited a December report in which he called
the index fairly valued at 15.4 times future profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
