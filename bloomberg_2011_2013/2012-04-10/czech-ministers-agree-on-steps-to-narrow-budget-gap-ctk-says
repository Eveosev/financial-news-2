Czech ministers whose portfolios
relate to the economy agreed today on measures to narrow next
yearâ€™s budget deficit, the state-run CTK newswire reported,
citing an unidentified person.  Agreeing on budget steps is a condition set by Prime
Minister Petr Necas for preserving the three-party ruling
coalition, the newswire said. The deal must be confirmed by the
leaders of the three ruling parties at a meeting later today, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
