Jaguar Mining Inc. (JAG) , the target of a
proposed takeover by  China ’s Shandong Gold Group Co. in
November, jumped the most in almost five months after Shandong’s
shares were suspended from trading pending news.  Jaguar, the Concord, New Hampshire-based company that
operates mines in Brazil, surged 15 percent to close at C$4.65
in Toronto. The increase was the biggest since Nov. 16, the day
that Shandong’s interest was first reported.  Shandong’s shares were suspended pending an announcement
about a bid for mining assets, the company said today in a
statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange .  Shandong made a $785 million, $9.30-a-share offer for
Jaguar, two people familiar with the deal said Nov. 16. Jaguar
said the same day it had received proposals in recent weeks and
that it had begun a strategic review to explore its options. The
company said Jan. 11 it had signed confidentiality agreements
with “several parties”.  Valeria Rezende Diodato, a spokeswoman for Jaguar, didn’t
respond to phone calls seeking comment.  Jaguar produces gold from three mines in  Brazil  and is
developing a fourth operation in the country. The company had
declined 38 percent this year through yesterday in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
