Avon Products Inc. (AVP) ’s new Chief
Executive Officer Sherilyn McCoy stands to gain three times her
salary and target bonus, rather than two times under normal
severance conditions, if she leaves after a change of control.  McCoy, 53, who is set to join Avon on April 23 following
the ouster of former CEO  Andrea Jung , also will retain benefits
for three years if she is terminated without cause or leaves
“for good reason” in the two years following a change, the New
York-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  McCoy is joining Avon, the world’s largest door-to-door
cosmetics seller, as Coty Inc. tries to persuade Avon
shareholders to pressure management to accept a $10 billion
takeover bid. The increased payout for McCoy if she leaves after
a change of control underscores Avon’s rejection of the offer.
Coty Chairman Bart Becht said last week that it “would not be
helpful” for Avon to hire a new CEO.  McCoy will be paid a base salary of $1.2 million, plus a
cash bonus with a target of $1.8 million, according to today’s
regulatory filing. She also will be paid a signing bonus of
$1.91 million and will participate in a three-year, long-term
incentive program with an annual target of $7.2 million.  McCoy, who previously was vice chairman of  Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ) ’s pharmaceutical and consumer division, will be working
at Avon to reverse three years of profit declines and complete
an investigation into the company’s overseas business practices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
