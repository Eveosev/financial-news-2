Vivergo Fuels Ltd.’s ethanol plant
near Hull in eastern  England  received its first wheat delivery
on April 3 as part of the facility’s startup, supplier Frontier
Agriculture Ltd. said.  The plant is expected to take 1,200 metric tons of wheat in
the first two weeks of operation, which will climb as more
capacity is used, Witham St. Hughs, England-based Frontier wrote
in a  statement  on its website today.  Vivergo, a joint venture between  BP Plc (BP/) ,  Associated British
Foods Plc (ABF)  and DuPont Co., will use 1.1 million tons of wheat a
year at its Hull plant to produce the biofuel ethanol, according
to its  website . That’s equal to 7.2 percent of last year’s U.K.
wheat  harvest , based on data from the Home-Grown Cereals
Authority.  “This first delivery of grain will be used for
commissioning which is well under way and will ramp up
significantly,” Frontier wrote. “The new plant will mean that
wheat that has traditionally been exported as animal feed will
now stay in the U.K.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
