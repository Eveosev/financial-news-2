Rajat Gupta, the former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  director charged with passing inside tips to
convicted Galleon Group Inc. co-founder  Raj Rajaratnam , faces a
new claim involving a quarterly sales forecast for  Procter &
Gamble Co. (PG) , U.S. prosecutors said in a court filing.  Prosecutors filed an amended bill of particulars today
providing details about the alleged tips they plan to prove
Gupta provided in their case against him.  Gupta tipped Rajaratnam and their unnamed coconspirators
about “P&G’s organic sales growth forecast for the October-
December quarter prior to P&G’s public announcement on or about
Dec. 11, 2008,” according to today’s filing in federal court in
Manhattan.  Gupta, the one-time McKinsey & Co. leader, was charged by
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara’s office in October. He
pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial May 21.  “As we have stated from the onset, the government’s
allegations are totally baseless,” Gupta’s lawyer,  Gary Naftalis , said in a statement today. “The facts in this case
demonstrate that Mr. Gupta is innocent of all of these charges,
and that he has always acted with honesty and integrity.”  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 11-907, U.S. District Court,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
