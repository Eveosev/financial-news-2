South African gold and foreign
currency reserves dropped the most in six months as the price of
bullion declined and the dollar gained against major currencies,
reducing the value of those holdings.  Gross  reserves  fell 2.3 percent to $50.7 billion in March
from the previous month, the Pretoria-based central bank said on
its website today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
five economists was $51.6 billion. Net reserves declined to
$48.9 billion from $49.6 billion.  “The significant decrease in the gross reserves largely
reflects liquidity management operations of the Bank and
valuation adjustments due to a lower gold price and the
appreciation of the  U.S. dollar  against the major currencies,”
the central bank said in the  statement .  Gold declined for a second month in March. Gold reserves,
which account for about 14 percent of gross holdings at the
central bank, fell $476 million to $6.7 billion. The dollar
gained against 12 of the 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, driving the value of the bank’s holdings of yen and
other currencies lower.  The rand was little changed at 7.8748 per dollar at 8:22
a.m. in Johannesburg, from 7.8788 before the data was released.
The currency has gained 2.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
