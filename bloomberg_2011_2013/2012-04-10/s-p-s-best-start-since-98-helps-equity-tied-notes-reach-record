The best start for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index in 14 years helped banks sell the most
structured notes linked to stocks last month since at least
January 2010.  Banks issued $2.75 billion in securities tied to equities
in March, excluding products known as reverse convertibles, for
64 percent of all sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The most popular underlying in the first quarter was
the  S&P 500  Index with $1.2 billion issued in 114 deals.  This year’s gains in the S&P Index have helped boost sales,
said John Tessar, senior vice president and head of structured
products at JVB Financial Group LLC. Better-than-estimated
earnings and economic data propelled the S&P 500 to a 12 percent
rise, the best first quarter since 1998.  “Investors are very aware of the S&P name,” making it
easier to sell products tied to the benchmark, Tessar said in a
telephone interview. “They see it all over the financial
media.”  In March,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  underwrote the top six
offerings tied to the gauge for $383.5 million. The  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based bank also issued $79.5 million in two-year
notes linked to the S&P 500 on March 29, the largest such sale
last month, Bloomberg data show. The securities pay three times
any gains in the index, capped at 25.4 percent, with investors
at risk of losing their principal, according to a prospectus
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  was the second-most popular among equities,
with $123 million in seven offerings tied to its stock in the
past month, followed by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  with $115.8 million in 17
deals, Bloomberg data show.  Ford’s Sale Forecast  Ford, the second-biggest U.S. carmaker, has climbed 9.2
percent so far this year. The company increased its projection
last week for U.S. vehicle sales this year to as much as 15
million from a range of 13.5 million to 14.5 million. Sales of
cars and light trucks in America rose 13 percent in March,
contributing to the best quarterly rate for the industry since
2008.  Banks have sold $265.9 million in notes tied to Apple in
the first quarter, more than double the $106.9 million a year
earlier, Bloomberg data show. The maker of iPhones and MacBook
Air laptops has risen almost 90 percent in the past year.
Cupertino, California-based Apple, which surpassed $600 a share
on March 15 for the first time, announced March 21 a quarterly
dividend of $2.65 a share for the period beginning July 1.  Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds, currencies
and commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
