Ukraine’s grains harvest may fall
to 46.8 million metric tons this year, agricultural researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  That would compare with a harvest of 56.7 million tons last
year, according to the country’s State Statistics Office.  Ukraine’s winter and spring crops may be damaged by the
late arrival of spring conditions, the Kiev-based researcher
said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
