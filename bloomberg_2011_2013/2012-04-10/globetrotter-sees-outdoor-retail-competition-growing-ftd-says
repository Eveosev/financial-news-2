Globetrotter GmbH predicts some
outdoor brands and retailers will disappear in coming years as
competition increases, Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing Andreas Bartmann, the company’s managing director.  Some retailers are currently forgoing profits in the
interest of expanding market share, the Hamburg-based newspaper
cited Bartmann as saying in an interview to be published
tomorrow.  The executive added that Globetrotter’s full-year revenue
may rise to 300 million euros ($393 million) to 350 million
euros by 2015 from 230 million euros in the 2010/2011 fiscal
year, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
