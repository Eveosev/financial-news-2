South Korea ’s won slid to a two-
week low as concern that the global economic recovery is losing
steam damped demand for emerging-market assets.  Government bonds 
were little changed.  China  reported an unexpected  trade surplus  for last month
as import growth trailed forecasts, data showed today. Its
inbound shipments increased 5.3 percent, below the 9 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey, while exports rose
8.9 percent from a year earlier. Figures last week showed hiring
by American employers in March trailed the most-pessimistic
forecast.  North Korea  may test a nuclear weapon after a planned
missile launch between April 12 and 16, a South Korean
intelligence report showed yesterday.  “China’s trade figures may have looked positive at a
glance, but a deeper analysis led to doubts about economic
growth, prompting some investors to buy the dollar” said Kim Do Hee, a Seoul-based currency trader at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group. “Geopolitical risks on the Korean peninsula also
prevented won gains.”  The won slid 0.1 percent to 1,139.70 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,139.93 earlier, the lowest since March 26. One-month
implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, declined one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 8.43 percent. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  of shares
slid 0.1 percent. South Korea’s financial markets are closed
tomorrow for parliamentary elections.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 was steady at 3.5 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
Three-year debt futures were little changed at 103.99 and the
one-year interest-rate swaps lost one basis point to 3.51
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
