Chilean economists raised their
forecasts for the  benchmark interest rate  in 11 months to 5.5
percent from the 5 percent estimated a month earlier, according
to a central bank survey.  Policy makers will keep the rate unchanged at 5 percent for
the third straight month in April, after cutting borrowing costs
in January, according to the monthly survey of economists posted
on the bank website today.  Consumer prices will rise 0.2 percent this month from March
and annual inflation will reach 3.3 percent in 11 months,
according to the median forecast of 61 economists.  The economy grew 5 percent in March from the previous year
and gross domestic product will expand 4.6 percent in 2012,
according to the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
