European  stock futures  tumbled,
indicating that equities in the region will extend last week’s
decline, after U.S. employers added fewer jobs in March than
forecast. Asian shares also retreated, while U.S. futures rose.  Rio Tinto Group and  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  may lead mining
companies lower as copper fell to a one-month low in London.
Spanish banks might be active after the government stepped up
efforts to bring the country’s deficit under control.  Futures on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index expiring in June lost
1.5 percent to 2,290 at 7:03 a.m. in London, while FTSE 100
Index futures retreated 1 percent after European markets were
closed yesterday for the Easter Monday holiday. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index slid 0.3 percent, while Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures expiring in June gained 0.3 percent.  The jobs report “puts a sting in the tail following robust
U.S. economic data,” said Nam Truong, a trader at Capital

strong rally in the first quarter of this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
