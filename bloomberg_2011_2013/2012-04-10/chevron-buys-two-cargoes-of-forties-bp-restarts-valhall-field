Chevron Corp. bought two  North Sea 
 Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude cargoes at higher prices, bringing its total
purchases for April-loading shipments to three. No bids or
offers were made for Russian Urals in Europe.  BP Plc resumed operation at its Valhall oil and natural-gas
field in the Norwegian North Sea after maintenance, according to
the company.  North Sea  Chevron bought one Forties cargo for April 22 to April 24
loading from Vitol Group at 35 cents a barrel more than  Dated
Brent (EUCRBRDT) , and another for April 24 to April 26 from Royal Dutch
Shell Plc at a premium of 50 cents to the benchmark, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window. On April 5, a cargo for April 18 to April
20 was sold at 20 cents more than Dated Brent.  Morgan Stanley didn’t manage to buy Forties for May 1 to
May 6 loading at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, the
survey showed.  Trafigura Beheer BV was unable to sell Forties for April 27
to April 29 at 45 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while
Total SA didn’t find buyers for May 2 to May 4 loading at 55
cents a barrel, according to the survey.  Total also failed to sell Forties on a ship-to-ship basis
from the tankers Stena Natalita or Eagle Tuscon. It offered at
60 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent for April 20 to April 25
transfer, or a premium of 80 cents for April 24 to April 30,
according to the survey.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which typically ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time.
Before the session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 34
cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of
17 cents on April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $121.07 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $121.23 yesterday. The June contract was at
$120.63, a discount of 44 cents to May.  Valhall is “back in production following the shutdown for
maintenance work,” Mark Salt, a London-based spokesman for BP,
said in an e-mailed response today. Output from the field
started on April 7 and is at normal levels of about 40,000
barrels a day of oil equivalent, he said.  BP shut the field at the end of March to repair a
compressor unit.  A Forties cargo with parcel number F0414 was delayed by one
day to load from April 19., according to three people with
knowledge of the export program. This brings total deferrals for
this month to 10 lots.  Exports of North Sea Flotta crude will be 1.2 million
barrels in May, compared with 1.3 million barrels in April,
according to a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals (EUCSURNW)  was at $2.77 a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest  Europe , compared with a discount of $3.58 in the
previous session, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
grade traded on April 5 at $2.80 less than Dated Brent for
delivery to Rotterdam.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. will supply full volumes in May to
customers in Europe, unchanged from this month, according to two
refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. issued its first tender to buy crude for
loading in June, a document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
The tender closes on April 11 and offers are valid until the
following day.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. sought to buy crude for loading from
June 1 to June 15, according to a separate tender document. It
closes on April 16, with offers valid until April 17.  Nigeria ’s benchmark  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  blend was at a premium of
$2.36 a barrel to Dated Brent, down from $2.45 on April 5,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
