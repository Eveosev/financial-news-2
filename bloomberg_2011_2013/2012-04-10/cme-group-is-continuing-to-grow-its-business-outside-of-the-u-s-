CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s biggest
futures exchange, is continuing to grow its business outside of
the U.S., spokesman Allan Schoenberg said.  The Financial Times reported yesterday that Chicago-based
CME Group is considering opening a futures exchange in London,
citing William Knottenbelt, head of CME’s operations in Europe,
Africa and the  Middle East . Schoenberg declined to comment on
the report.  CME’s European clearinghouse, CME Clearing Europe, began in
May 2011 in London. It has more than 180 over-the-counter
commodity products for clearing and plans to start clearing
interest rate swaps by the end of the year, Schoenberg said by
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
