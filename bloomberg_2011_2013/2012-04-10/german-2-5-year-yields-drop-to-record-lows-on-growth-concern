Spanish notes led a decline in the
debt of  Europe ’s higher-yielding nations and German yields slid
to records on concern a slowing global economy will deepen the
region’s debt crisis.  Ten-year German bunds, Europe’s benchmark government
securities, outperformed all euro-area peers on bets that
 European Central Bank  loans are proving insufficient to stop the
crisis from spreading through the region. A Swiss sale of six-
month bills drew a negative yield as investors sought
alternative assets to euro-area debt. U.S. and U.K. bonds
rallied as stocks fell after a report on April 6 showed weaker-
than-forecast U.S. job growth.  “We have a renewed concern in the euro region as the debt
problem hasn’t gone away despite the liquidity support from the
European Central Bank,” said  Vincent Chaigneau , the global head
of interest-rate strategy at Societe Generale SA in Paris. “The
poor non-farm payroll data out of the U.S. only exacerbated the
risk-off sentiment. Peripheral bond yields are likely to
continue to rise in the near term.”  Spain’s five-year note yield jumped 31 basis points, or
0.31 percentage point, to 4.93 percent at 4:13 p.m. London time,
the highest since Jan. 9. The 4.25 percent securities maturing
in October 2016 fell 1.205, or 12.05 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,307) face amount, to 97.28.  The nation’s 10-year bonds dropped for a fourth day,
sending the yield 23 basis points higher to 5.99 percent, the
most since Dec. 12. That increased the additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity
bunds by 33 basis points to 435 basis points.  German Records  Volatility on Spanish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets followed by  Italy , according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.
The change in the yield was 2.7 times the 90-day average.  Spanish 10-year yields have risen to the most since the ECB
started providing three-year loans in December in its longer-
term refinancing operations.  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell 10 basis points to 1.64
percent, approaching its all-time low of 1.636 percent set on
Sept. 23. The five-year yield declined 10 basis points to 0.617
percent, the least on record.  German two-year  note yields  dropped five basis points to
0.093 percent, the lowest since Bloomberg began collecting the
data in 1990. The rate slid below its Japanese peer for the
first time, based on closing-market data.  Spanish Banks  Spain ’s government yesterday repeated its pledge to reduce
the nation’s deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product next
year. Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  met health and education
ministers to discuss spending cuts of more than 10 billion
euros.  Spanish banks may need additional capital if the economy
“worsens more than expected,” Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said in  Madrid  today, as he said the
recovery will be slow. If the economy “finally recovers, what
has been done will be more than enough,” he said.  Treasury 10-year yields fell below 2 percent for the first
time in almost one month and U.K. gilt yields for similar-
maturity securities dropped to 2.01 percent, the least since
Feb. 28. The MSCI World Index of shares slid 0.7 percent.  Italian 10-year yields rose 24 basis points to 5.69
percent, pushing the yield spread to bunds to more than 400
basis points for the first time since Feb. 16.  U.S. Payrolls  U.S. payrolls increased by 120,000 in March, the Labor
Department said on April 6. That’s the fewest in five months and
less than the most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. The  U.S. economy  is still “far from having fully
recovered” from the financial crisis, Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said in a speech yesterday.  Demand for bunds was also supported after a Chinese report
showed import growth trailed forecasts, underscoring risks of a
deeper slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy.  The French  yield spread  over bunds widened to as much as
136 basis points, from 125 basis points last week, the most
since Jan. 18 after a report today showed the nation’s
manufacturing production slid 1.2 percent in February, a third
month of declines.  France  sold 7.8 billion euros of bills maturing in 84, 175
and 357 days. It auctioned the 175-day bills at an average yield
of 0.119 percent, compared to an average yield of minus 0.251
percent in  Switzerland ’s sale of 182-day government bills.
 Austria  and the Netherlands also auctioned debt today.  German bunds returned 14 percent in the past year and 0.7
percent in 2012, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French
bonds gained 8.9 percent during the past 12 months, with Spanish
securities returning 3.3 percent in the period, the indexes
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
