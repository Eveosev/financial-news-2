Iran stopped exporting crude oil to
Greece,  state-run Press TV said , citing the country’s Oil
Minister Rostam Qasemi.  Press TV reported on April 5 that Iran halted oil sales to
two Greek companies,  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE)  and Motor Oil Hellas
SA, after they failed to pay.  Iran has already cut oil exports to France and the U.K.
following the European Union decision to ban purchases of the
Islamic republic’s crude starting July 1, the broadcaster said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
