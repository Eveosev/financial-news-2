Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose,
pushing yields to the lowest level in more than 16 months, on
speculation the central bank will cut  interest rates  next month.
The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will lower the deposit rate cap
to 12 percent from 13 percent, online newspaper Dan Tri reported
last week, citing Do Thi Nhung, deputy head of the monetary-
policy department at the central bank, without giving a specific
timeframe.  “Investors are expecting the rate cap to be cut next
month,” said Tran Thanh Thao, a fixed-income analyst at Thang
Long Securities Joint-Stock Co. “I expect bond yields will
continue with this downtrend in the short term.”  The  yield  on five-year notes fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 11.31 percent, the lowest level since
Nov. 23, 2010, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled
by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,833 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
