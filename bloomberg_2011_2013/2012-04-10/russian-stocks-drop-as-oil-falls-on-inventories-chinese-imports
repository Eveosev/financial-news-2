Russian  stocks  dropped for the
second time in the past three days as oil, the country’s main
revenue earner, fell on projections U.S. stockpiles rose and as
Chinese crude imports retreated.  The Micex Index of 30 shares slipped 0.9 percent to
1,498.07 by the close in Moscow, erasing an earlier gain of as
much as 0.6 percent. Oil producers OAO Gazprom Neft and OAO
Tatneft lost 3.2 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.  OAO
Gazprom (GAZP) , the natural gas export monopoly, fell 1.8 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index decreased 0.9 percent to 1,606.98.  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, slid as much as
$1.3 to $101.19 a barrel in  New York  as the Energy Department is
expected to report U.S. inventories rose 2 million barrels to
364.4 million last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts. China’s net crude imports fell 6 percent in March and
overseas purchases of all goods missed economists’ estimates,
customs data showed, signaling lower demand.  “Fundamentals are mixed at present and the best argument
in favor of equities - and  Russia  - would still appear to be
positioning which remains extremely cautious,” Julian Rimmer, a
trader of Russian shares at CF Global Trading U.K. Ltd. in
 London , said in e-mailed comments.  OAO Magnit, the Russian retailer, rose the most in a month
after the company said its first-quarter sales advanced by more
than a third. The shares jumped as much as 4.3 percent before
closing 2.5 percent higher at 3,672 rubles, their biggest
advance since March 11. Magnit said today its sales rose 34
percent to 101 billion rubles ($3.4 billion), compared with the
same period in 2011.  Russian stocks rallied 8.2 percent in the first three
months of the year, the biggest quarterly gain in more than a
year on signs the global economy recovery is spurring demand for
commodities. The gauge trades at 5.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for member companies, below the 11.8 ratio for the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
