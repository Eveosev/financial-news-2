Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  fell after rising bond yields in Spain highlighted the
risk that the euro member may need a bailout, reviving concern
about  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and damping the earnings
outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , Japan’s biggest
camera maker that counts Europe as its No. 1 market, slid 2
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest lender,
dropped 3.7 percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s
biggest oil producer and mining company, fell 1.8 percent after
oil and metal prices declined.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,360 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,540 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,380 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index lost 1.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
declined 0.5 percent in Wellington.  “Spain is in a very difficult situation and more likely
than not to require some type of official intervention at some
point,” said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment
markets research at Colonial First State Global Asset
Management, which oversees about $150 billion. “Europe is still
20 percent of the world economy and obviously a big customer of
Asia.”  Spanish Bond Yields  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The index fell 1.7 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Spanish bonds slumped after Economy Minister Luis de Guindos
declined to rule out a rescue and Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said the nation’s lenders may need extra
capital if the economy weakens more than expected. The 10-year
Spanish bond yield surged 22 basis points to 5.98 percent, the
highest level this year. The Italian 10-year yield also rose 23
basis points to 5.69 percent.  The yen rose against all of its 16 major counterparts
yesterday, denting the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.
The yen touched 80.62 per dollar today, the highest level since
March 7, while reaching 105.49 per euro, the strongest since
Feb. 22.  In Japan, a government report is forecast to show machine
orders fell 0.8 percent in February after rising 3.4 percent in
January, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The report is due at 8:50 a.m. Tokyo time.  Brent oil for May settlement dropped $2.79, or 2.3 percent,
to end the session at $119.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
dropped 3 percent yesterday.  Chinese Stocks  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 8.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 8 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 3.3 percent rise by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
10.5 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities in the U.S. slid, led by consumer stocks,
as import growth that trailed economists’ estimates added to
concern that the world’s second-largest economy is faltering.
The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
shares in the U.S. sank 2.5 percent to 99.44 yesterday in New
York, the lowest level since Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
