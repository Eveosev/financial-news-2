Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average extending its losing streak to the
longest since 2009, after the  Bank of Japan  refrained from
additional stimulus today and the yen rose against the dollar,
dimming the earnings outlook for the nation’s exporters.  Sony Corp., the money-losing electronics maker which
yesterday said it will cut 10,000 jobs, extended declines as the
yen strengthened after the BOJ’s announcement.  Sharp Corp. (6753) , the
nation’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, dropped 4.3
percent after a report its loss could widen on poor sales of TVs
and solar cells, according to the Nikkei newspaper. Kansai
Electric Power Co. advanced 3.4 percent after a report the prime
minister “basically” approved safety measures for its nuclear
reactors, moving a step closer to restarting the facilities.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.1 percent to 9,538.02 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , dropping for a sixth day, the longest run of
declines since July 2009. Volume on the gauge was 14 percent
below the 30-day average. The broader Topix Index was little
changed at 813.43, paring gains of as much as 1 percent after no
additional monetary easing was announced at today’s BOJ meeting.  “The market is calling for action from the BOJ,” said
 Hiroaki Muto , a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo, which manages about $123 billion. “The
bank’s policy makers might have reached a consensus to do
something at the next meeting. Political pressure is backing
them into a corner and will force them to act.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.3
percent today. The gauge slid 1.1 percent in  New York  yesterday
after a report showed U.S. employers in March added the fewest
jobs in five months.  Topix Performance  The Topix gained about 12 percent this year on optimism the
central bank will introduce more measures to spur growth and
that reconstruction after last year’s disasters will escalate.  Exporters’ shares fell as the yen rose against the dollar
after the BOJ said no additional stimulus measures were proposed
at today’s meeting. The central bank kept its key rate near zero
and left its asset-purchase fund unchanged after boosting the
program in February, a move that drove down Japan’s currency and
lifted stocks.  Sony, Japan’s biggest producer of consumer electronics,
lost 3.5 percent to 1,586 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, slid 0.8 percent to 3,750 yen, after rising as
much as 0.3 percent earlier in the day.  Sharp fell 4.3 percent to 530 yen after the Nikkei reported
the electronics maker’s net loss could increase to 390 billion
yen ($4.8 billion) in the year ended on March 31 due to sluggish
sales. The newspaper also reported Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.
will gain a controlling stake in Sharp’s cutting-edge display
factory near Osaka.  Kansai Electric Advances  Kansai Electric Power added 3.4 percent to 1,351 yen as
Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  held talks last night on switching
on the utility’s two reactors that have passed stress tests.
Noda’s group “basically” approved the company’s safety
measures, the Nikkei reported today, citing Industry Minister
 Yukio Edano .  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker by market value,
rose after Nomura Holdings Inc. raised target prices in the
sector, citing rising sales at home and in the U.S. and
 Southeast Asia . Toyota gained 1.5 percent to 3,360 yen.  Honda
Motor Co. (7267)  climbed 0.5 percent to 2,952 yen, paring its earlier
gain of 2.5 percent.  Shares on the Topix are valued at one times book value,
compared with 2.25 times for the S&P 500 and 1.43 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2.5 percent to 19.87,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
