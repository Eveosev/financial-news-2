Estonia’s central bank said it must
boost reserves by 3 1/2 times in the long term to reduce the
risks of participating in  European Central Bank  measures to
tackle the region’s debt crisis.  Eesti Pank  plans to increase its equity capital to 1.31
billion euros ($1.72 billion) from 370 million euros, raising
its equity relative to the total for euro-area central banks to
0.26 percent, the same as its relative ECB contribution, its
board said today in an e-mailed statement from Tallinn, the
capital.  “The volume of Eesti Pank’s risk assets has significantly
increased due to the financial crisis in the  euro zone ,” the
board said. “The central bank’s risks have increased and the
bank’s reserves must match those risks.”  The ECB’s decision to issue three-year loans to commercial
banks has heightened risks to regional central banks’ balance
sheets, Deputy Governor Ulo Kaasik said March 28. Estonia
adopted the euro last year.  The bank won’t contribute more than a quarter of its annual
profit to the state budget until its reserve goal has been
reached, the board said. Income was 22.7 million euros last
year, of which 5.7 million euros will be allocated to government
reserves, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
