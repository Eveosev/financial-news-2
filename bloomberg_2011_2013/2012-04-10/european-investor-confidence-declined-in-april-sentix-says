European  investor confidence 
dropped for the first time in four months in April as the debt
crisis damped economic growth, the Sentix research institute
said.  An index measuring sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
declined to minus 14.7 from minus 8.2 in March, Limburg,
Germany-based Sentix said in an e-mailed statement today. A
gauge of expectations dropped to minus 9.3 from minus 2.3, while
a measure of current conditions fell to minus 20 from minus 14.  The  European Central Bank  has pumped more than 1 trillion
euros ($1.3 trillion) into the banking system to stem a debt
crisis that forced Greece into the biggest debt restructuring in
history. The euro-area economy will shrink 0.3 percent this year,
according to the European Commission, which projects
contractions in eight  member states  and expansion of 0.6 percent
in  Germany .  “The euro area’s economic stabilization, craved by
governments and supported by generous supply of central bank
liquidity, is being questioned only one month after the ECB’s
second three-year tender,” Sentix said. “The economic recovery
in the euro zone is hampered by slight setbacks in growth
engines like Asia and Germany.”  Sentix said 847 investors participated in the survey, which
was conducted April 4-7. The results are never revised.  To contact the reporter on this story:
