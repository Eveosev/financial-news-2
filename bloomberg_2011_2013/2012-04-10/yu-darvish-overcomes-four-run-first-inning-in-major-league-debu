Pitcher Yu Darvish settled down
after a four-run first inning in his Major League Baseball debut
for the  Texas Rangers  despite giving up three hits to Japanese
countryman Ichiro Suzuki of the  Seattle Mariners .  Darvish allowed five runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings
and left the game in the sixth inning with  Texas  leading 8-5.
The right-hander walked four and struck out five at Rangers
Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  Darvish got off to a rough start, throwing five straight
balls to open the game and allowing the Mariners four runs on
four hits in the first inning. He gave up a single by Suzuki and
walked Munenori Kawasaki on four pitches with the bases loaded,
throwing 42 pitches in the inning.  The Rangers paid a record $51.7 million transfer fee to
Darvishâ€™s Japanese club before signing him to a six-year
contract. Darvish, 25, went 93-38 with a 1.99 earned run average  in seven seasons with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
