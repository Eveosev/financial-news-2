European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another fell to the lowest in eight months, according to
a money-market indicator.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 41 basis
points at 9:22 a.m. in  London  from 42 yesterday, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure, which started the year at 95
basis points, is the lowest since Aug. 1.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars rose. The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 55
basis points below Euribor from 54 basis points on April 5. The
cost reached an eight-month low of minus 49.5 on March 26.  The one-year basis swap was 53.5 basis points less than
Euribor from 51 basis points on April 5. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased overnight deposits at the  European
Central Bank  on April 5, placing 785 billion euros ($1 trillion)
with the Frankfurt-based bank, up from 773 billion euros the day
before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
