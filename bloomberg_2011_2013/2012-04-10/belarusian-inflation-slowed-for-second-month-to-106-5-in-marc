Belarus’s inflation decelerated for
a second month,  slowing  to 106.5 percent in March from a year
earlier, compared with 107.4 percent in the previous month, the
state statistics service said in a statement on its website late
yesterday.  The former Soviet republic is seeking to cap consumer-price
growth at 19 percent to 22 percent this year after the country’s
foreign-currency currency shortage and the current-account
deficit fanned inflation in 2011, the central bank said Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
