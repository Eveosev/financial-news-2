General Electric Co. (GE)  will supply a
subsidiary of  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  with 288 turbines for six wind
farms in Canada that will be able to power about 120,000 homes.  The 1.6-megawatt turbines will be used in NextEra Energy’s
projects in Ontario that will be operational in 2013 and 2014,
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said today in a statement.  NextEra Energy is developing the projects after winning 20-
year power purchase agreements from the Ontario Power Authority.  “These projects will benefit the environment, and they
will help create jobs and generate additional economic
opportunities,” NextEra Chief Executive Officer Armando Pimentel said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
