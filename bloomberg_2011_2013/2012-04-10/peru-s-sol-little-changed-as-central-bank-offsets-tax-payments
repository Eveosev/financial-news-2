Peru ’s sol was little changed as
exporters bought the currency to pay taxes, leading the central
bank to purchase dollars to curb gains.  The sol traded at 2.6658 per U.S. dollar at today’s close,
compared with 2.6670 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit.  Peru’s central bank said it  bought  $71 million in the spot
market today and paid an average 2.666 soles per dollar. The
purchases offset demand for soles from companies making monthly
income-tax payments and kept the sol “steady,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima.  To contact the reporter on this story:
