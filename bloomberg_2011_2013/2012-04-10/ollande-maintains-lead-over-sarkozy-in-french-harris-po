French Socialist challenger
 Francois Hollande  would defeat President Nicolas Sarkozy by 53
percent to 47 percent in the decisive second round of  France ’s
presidential elections, according to a Harris Interactive poll.
That’s the same gap as in the previous poll a week ago.  For the April 22 first round, Sarkozy would win 28 percent
and Hollande 27 percent, with Sarkozy losing one percentage
point and Hollande gaining a point. Anti-immigrant campaigner
Marine Le Pen remained third with 16 percent. Under the French
system, the top two progress to a run-off, due on May 6.  The poll involved 1,033 people questioned April 3-6. No
margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
