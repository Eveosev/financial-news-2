Manchester City striker  Mario Balotelli  won’t face further punishment for his foot-first
challenge on Arsenal’s  Alex Song  two days ago.  Balotelli lunged at Song, putting his foot into the Arsenal
midfielder’s shin, during the first half of City’s 1-0 loss at
Emirates Stadium. England’s Football Association said in a
 statement  on its website that further action couldn’t be taken
because the incident was seen by one of the officials, with no
card being issued to Balotelli.  “Retrospective action can only be taken in scenarios where
none of the match officials saw the players coming together,”
the F.A. said. “The normal scenarios in which retrospective
action is taken are for ‘off the ball’ incidents.”  Balotelli will serve a three-match suspension after being
sent off for a second yellow card following his lunging tackle
on Bacary Sagna in the game’s closing minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
