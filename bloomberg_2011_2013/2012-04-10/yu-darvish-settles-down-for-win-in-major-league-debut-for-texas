Pitcher Yu Darvish settled down
after a four-run first inning to win his Major League Baseball
debut for the Texas Rangers despite giving up three hits to
Japanese countryman  Ichiro Suzuki  of the  Seattle Mariners .  Darvish allowed five runs on eight hits in 5 2-3 innings
and the Rangers hit four home runs in their 11-5 victory last
night at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas. The right-hander
walked four and struck out five.  Darvish got off to a rough start, throwing five straight
balls to open the game and allowing the Mariners four runs on
four hits in the first inning. He gave up a single by Suzuki and
walked Munenori Kawasaki on four pitches with the bases loaded,
throwing 42 pitches in the inning.  “It was just a matter of him controlling his energy,”
Texas manager  Ron Washington  told reporters. “He was over-amped.
It wasn’t that he was scared or nervous or anything like that.”  Seattle  scored another run in the second inning on doubles
by Suzuki and Kyle Seager. Kawasaki singled in the third and the
Mariners had two runners on base before Darvish started a streak
of getting 10 straight batters out.  Nelson Cruz and Ian Kinsler hit three-run homers for Texas,
which also got home runs from Josh Hamilton and Mitch Moreland.  The Rangers paid a record $51.7 million transfer fee to
Darvish’s Japanese club before signing him to a six-year
contract. Darvish, 25, went 93-38 with a 1.99 earned run average
in seven seasons with the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
