Berthold Huber, head of  Germany ’s
IG Metall industrial union, called for raising the country’s top
income-tax rate to more than the current 42 percent,
 Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview.  With a view to government budgets strained by the debt
crisis, Huber said that turning the 42 percent rate into a dogma
isn’t a forward-looking policy, according to comments published
in the newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
