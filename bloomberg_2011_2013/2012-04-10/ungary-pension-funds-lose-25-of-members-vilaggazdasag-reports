A quarter of  Hungary â€™s remaining
100,000 private-pension fund members decided to transfer their
accounts to the government,  Vilaggazdasag  said, citing industry
group Stabilitas Penztarszovetseg.  Several pension funds will close, the Budapest-based
business daily reported.  Hungary effectively nationalized $13 billion in private-
pension fund assets when more than 3 million people turned over
their accounts to the state after the government in 2010
threatened to strip them of their right to a state pension.  To contact the reporter on this story:
