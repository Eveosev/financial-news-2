The  European Central Bank  said it
drained 214 billion euros ($280 billion) in seven-day deposits
to neutralize the liquidity created by its government bond-
purchase program.  The Frankfurt-based central bank said 66 banks submitted
bids totaling 365.3 billion euros. The ECB sterilizes its
government bond purchases to ensure they donâ€™t fuel inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
