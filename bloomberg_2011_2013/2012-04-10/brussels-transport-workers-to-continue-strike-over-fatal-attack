Public transport workers in
Brussels may continue  strike action  until April 12 in response
to the killing of one of their colleagues this weekend,  L’Echo
reported , citing interviews with strikers.  Belgium ’s government has promised to bolster security on
the Brussels public transport system, in response to the
incident, the newspaper said. Iliaz Tahiraj, a supervisor for
the transport system, was killed by an assailant on April 7 at
the scene of a crash between a public bus and a car.  Trade union officials have decided that the strike, which
began over the weekend, will continue at least throughout today,
with decisions pending on whether it should remain in place
until later this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
