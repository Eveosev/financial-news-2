Italian and Spanish government
bonds opened lower, increasing the additional yield investors
demand to hold the securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on  Italy ’s 10-year bond rose six basis points to
5.51 percent at 7:45 a.m. London time. That pushed the yield
spread to bunds 10 basis points wider to 3.81 percentage points.
It reached 388 basis points, the most since Feb. 16.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield also increased five basis
points, to 5.80 percent, with the spread to bunds widening to as
much as 4.12 percentage points, the most since Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
