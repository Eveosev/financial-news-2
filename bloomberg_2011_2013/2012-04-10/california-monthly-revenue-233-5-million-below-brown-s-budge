California (STOCA1)  took in $233.5 million
less in revenue in March than what Governor  Jerry Brown 
estimated in his budget proposal, the state controller said.  Most of the shortfall was caused by corporate tax receipts,
which came in $125.8 million, or 8.2 percent, below projections,
Controller John Chiang said in a statement. Sales taxes were
down by $25.7 million. Personal-income taxes were $41.4 million
below forecast, a gap caused by taxpayer refunds going out
faster than expected.  Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, proposed a budget in January
that seeks to erase a $9 billion deficit in part by asking
voters to temporarily raise income and sales taxes through a
November referendum. If voters reject that proposal, Brown’s
plan calls for $5 billion of automatic cuts midway through the
fiscal year that begins July 1. Most of those reductions would
come from education.  “While revenues continue to fall short, the months ahead
will be far more important to the state’s finances,” Chiang
said in a statement. “More than 35 percent of all revenues are
expected in the next three months, making this the most
important period for tax collection in the fiscal year.”  Personal-income taxes composed more than half the state’s
annual revenue, and 14 percent of the total came in  April  last
year, Chiang said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
