The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt rose on concern that a
slowdown in U.S. job creation is hampering the global recovery.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 27
basis points to 667 at 10 a.m. in  London , the highest since Jan.
19, according to BNP Paribas SA. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Employers in the U.S. added 120,000 jobs in March, the
fewest in five months, a report showed April 6, while  Spain  is
struggling to avoid becoming Europe’s fourth nation to require a
bailout. Today is London’s “first chance to react” to the jobs
figure as trading resumes after markets were closed April 6 and
April 9 for the Easter holiday, according to Harpreet Parhar, a
strategist at Credit Agricole SA in London.  “Any positive news from the U.S. has more than outweighed
continuing concerns on the sovereign crisis side,” Parhar said.
“If momentum in the data has changed, then we don’t have a
positive balance from the U.S.”  The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 7 basis points to 139.5. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks
and insurers increased 11.5 basis points to 247.5 and the
subordinated index climbed 17 to 398.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments jumped 5.5 basis points to
276.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
