 Electrica SA  plans to borrow 50 million euros ($66 million) to
build a wind farm in the east of the country, Bursa reported
today, citing General Manager Ioan Folescu.  The state-owned company will launch an auction in the next
few days to attract loan offers for its Frumusita wind park with
a capacity of about 45 megawatts and plans to pick the builder
and the equipment supplier this year for the project through
public auctions, the Bucharest-based  newspaper quoted  Folescu as
saying. Construction will probably start this autumn, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
