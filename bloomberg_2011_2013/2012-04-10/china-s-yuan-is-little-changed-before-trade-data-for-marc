The yuan was little changed before
the release of  China ’s trade data for March.  Overseas sales  gained 7 percent from a year earlier,
according to the median estimate of 29 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. China may also report a  trade deficit  of $3.15
billion and import growth of 9 percent, surveys showed.
 Inflation (CNCPIYOY)  accelerated to 3.6 percent from 3.2 percent in
February, according to official data yesterday.  “Investors are looking for clearer indications of where
China’s economy is headed,” said  Daniel Chan , chief economist
at BWC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. “However, yuan gains are
likely to be slower this year as  Europe ’s debt crisis continues
to drag on China’s export growth.”  The yuan traded at 6.3072 per dollar as of 10:43 a.m. in
 Shanghai , from 6.3085 yesterday, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The People’s Bank of China weakened the
yuan’s  daily reference rate  by 0.04 percent to 6.3048 today. The
currency is allowed to move as much as 0.5 percent on either
side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was unchanged at
6.3105 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained
0.01 percent to 6.3345, a 0.4 percent discount to the onshore
spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
2.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
