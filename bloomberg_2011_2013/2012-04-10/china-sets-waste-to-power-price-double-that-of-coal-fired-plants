China, the biggest carbon emitter,
set a price for electricity generated from waste-to-energy
plants that’s double that paid to coal-fired projects to
encourage renewable-energy development.  Developers of waste-to-energy plants will be paid 0.65 yuan
(10 U.S. cents) a kilowatt-hour, the National Development and
Reform Commission said today in a  statement . Coal-fired projects
get 0.3 to 0.4 yuan a kilowatt-hour, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  The rate is above the highest price of 0.61 yuan a
kilowatt-hour paid to wind-power projects. Developers of solar
projects get paid a minimum of 1 yuan a kilowatt-hour.  “It’s the first time that China has established a fixed
price for waste-to-power plants,” Jessica Ng, an analyst at New
Energy Finance, said by phone. “It will help energy companies
to share the cost burden of the feedstock.”  The government is seeking to cut carbon dioxide emissions
by as much as 17 percent per unit of gross domestic product in
its five-year plan through 2015.  China  aims to derive 15 percent
of its energy from non-fossil fuels by 2020.  The rate to be paid to waste-to-energy projects may raise
retail prices as the government has allowed grid companies to
lift them due to an increase in the cost of purchasing power.
The nation doubled the surcharges used to offer financial
assistance to renewable-energy projects to 0.008 yuan a
kilowatt-hour last year.  -- Feifei Shen Editors: Baldave Singh, Randall Hackley  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
