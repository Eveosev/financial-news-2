The  Federal Reserve  began
purchasing Treasuries as part of its program to replace
$400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries to limit borrowing costs.  The central bank listed $4.25 billion to $5 billion of
securities maturing from April 2018 to February 2020 for
possible purchase between 1:15 p.m. and 2 p.m. New York time. It
purchased $1.843 billion of notes due from February 2036 to May
2041 earlier today.  The Fed is purchasing longer-maturity Treasuries and
selling a similar amount of shorter-term debt under a monetary
stimulus plan thatâ€™s become known as Operation Twist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
