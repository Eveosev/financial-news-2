Hungary ’s benchmark BUX stock index
dropped 0.9 percent to 18,035.85 as of the close in Budapest.
The following are among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, fell 2.2
percent to 3,668 forint after an April 6 report showed U.S.
employers added fewer jobs in March than expected, damping the
outlook for recovery in the world’s biggest economy. The shares
didn’t trade on April 6 and 9 because of the Easter holiday.  EST MEDIA Vagyonkezelo Nyrt. (ESTMEDIA HB), a Hungarian
entertainment company, slumped to the lowest on record after its
fourth-quarter net loss widened. Shares retreated 15 percent to
100 forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
