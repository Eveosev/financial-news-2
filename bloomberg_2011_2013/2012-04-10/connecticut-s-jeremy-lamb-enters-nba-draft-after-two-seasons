Jeremy Lamb will enter the National
Basketball Association draft after two seasons at the  University
of Connecticut , where he won a national championship as a
freshman and led the team in scoring last season.  The 6-foot-5 guard averaged 17.7 points and 4.9 rebounds a
game for the Huskies during the 2011-12 season. He becomes the
14th  Connecticut  player during coach  Jim Calhoun ’s tenure to
declare for the NBA draft as an underclassman, with all but one
of the previous 13 taken in the first round.  “It’s never easy to lose a great player from your program,
but Jeremy has a unique opportunity that he needs to take
advantage of,” Calhoun said in a statement released by the
school. “I look forward to him developing into a terrific
player in the NBA and secondly, as he’s promised me, to come
back and finish his degree.”  Lamb, 19, is projected as the sixth pick in the June 28
draft by  NBAdraft.net . He’s one of six players in UConn history
to score 1,000 points through their sophomore season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
