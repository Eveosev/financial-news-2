OAO Synergy, the Russian vodka
maker, headed to its lowest level in almost three months after
second-half sales declined, eating into its full-year profit.  The shares retreated 1 percent to 517 rubles by 4:18 p.m.
in Moscow, on course for the lowest since Jan. 16.  Synergy said today sales tumbled 12 percent in the second
half as administrative costs and financing expenses jumped,
trimming the full-year growth to 19 percent. Net income for 2011
rose 6 percent to 1.66 billion rubles ($56 million), the vodka
producer said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
