Indonesia ’s rupiah snapped a two-
day gain ahead of a central bank rate decision at which
economists predict borrowing costs will be left unchanged after
inflation accelerated last month.  Bank Indonesia will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at
5.75 percent when it meets on April 12 after cutting it by 25
basis points in February, according to all 18  economists 
surveyed by Bloomberg. Consumer-price gains quickened for the
first time in seven months to 3.97 percent in March, from 3.56
percent in February, official data show.  “The market is watching the Bank Indonesia rate decision
and inflation, which has already picked up,” said Taufan Tito,
a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia, the nation’s second-largest bank by market value. The
rupiah will probably trade between 9,100 and 9,200 per dollar
this week, he said.  The rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 9,175 per dollar as of
4:04 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at
6.75 percent for a fourth day.  The rupiah strengthened as much as 1.5 percent to a seven-
week high of 9,007 earlier.  Bank Indonesia  will continue to
monitor and intervene in the foreign-exchange and secondary bond
markets to stabilize the currency, according to a statement
posted on its website March 8.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
was little changed at 5.94 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
