Russia  will keep its tax on raw
sugar imports at $140 a metric ton in May, the Customs Union
Commission of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan said.  The duty is based on monthly sugar prices in  New York , with
a one-month lag, according to the Customs Union Commission,
which oversees the tariffs for Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The sweetener was calculated at 24.73 cents a pound, or $545.26
a ton in March, according to a statement on the commissionâ€™s
website today.  The rate was also $140 a ton in April and is expected to
stay at that level through July, according to the commission
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
