Russian  stocks  rallied after the
supermarket chain OAO Magnit reported a surge in sales and as
OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, rallied.  The Micex Index of 30 shares climbed 0.4 percent to
1,517.13 by 1:16 p.m. in Moscow, erasing an earlier fall of as
much as 0.8 percent.  Magnit (MGNT)  surged 3.8 percent after reporting a
34 percent jump in first quarter sales.  Sberbank (SBER) , which
represents 15.4 percent of the index, gained 0.7 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index added 0.3 percent to 1,626.5.  China reported an unexpected trade surplus last month as
the 5.3 percent growth in imports trailed the 9 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Exports rose 8.9 percent
from a year earlier, more than forecast, leaving a  trade surplus 
of $5.35 billion, compared with a median projection for a $3.15
billion trade deficit.  “This is good news, because it suggests we will be back to
20 percent export growth in April and May,”  Charles Robertson ,
analyst at  Renaissance Capital , wrote in an e-mailed report
today. “Chinese exports will recover in the coming two months
and this will lift Chinese imports too.”  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, fell as much as
62 cents to $101.84 a barrel in  New York . Inventories probably
increased 2 million barrels to 364.4 million last week,
according to a Bloomberg News survey before a U.S. Energy
Department report tomorrow. Urals crude, Russia’s chief export
blend, hasn’t traded since April 5.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, rose 0.3
percent to 210.08 rubles. OAO Lukoil, the country’s second-
biggest producer, added 0.9 percent to 1,805 rubles.  Russian stocks rallied 8.2 percent in the first quarter,
the biggest quarterly gain in more than a year on signs the
global economy recovery is spurring demand for commodities. The
gauge trades at 5.6 times analysts’ earnings estimates for
member companies, below the 11.8 ratio for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
