JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, valued its Vigor Alimentos SA unit at 1.19 billion
reais ($655 million) as it plans to spin off the Brazilian
dairy-products maker to compete with  Danone SA (BN)  and  Nestle SA. (NESN)   JBS offered to swap 149.7 million of its shares for the
same amount in Vigor, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday. Each share was valued at 7.96 reais, Sao Paulo-based
JBS said in the filing.  JBS is seeking to spin off Vigor and list its shares in  Sao
Paulo  as Brazil’s growing middle class increases consumption of
yogurt, cheese and other dairy products. Growth in  Latin
America ’s largest economy has pulled more than 35 million people
out of poverty in the past decade.  Vigor, maker of the Faixa Azul Parmesan cheese, has a 6.9
percent market share of dairy products in  Brazil , according to a
company presentation.  JBS rose 0.4 percent to 7.72 reais yesterday. It has
climbed 27 percent this year, compared with a 11 increase in the
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
