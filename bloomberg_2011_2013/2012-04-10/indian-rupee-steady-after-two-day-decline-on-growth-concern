India ’s rupee was little changed
after a two-day decline on concern economic growth will slow,
damping demand for the nation’s assets.  Industrial production  growth eased to 6.6 percent in
February from a year earlier, compared with 6.8 percent in
January, according to the median of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey before data due this week. The current-account
deficit  widened  to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the
last quarter of 2011 from 2.97 percent in the preceding three
months, official data show.  “In the near term we’re not looking for the rupee to
outperform other Asian currencies,” said Nick Verdi, a
Singapore-based currency strategist at  Barclays Capital . “There
are still ongoing issues such as the current-account deficit,”
which will need funding through inflows, he said.  The rupee was little changed at 51.1425 per dollar as of
10:03 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It dropped 0.8 percent in the previous two trading days. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage
point, to 9.8 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Six-month onshore forwards traded at 52.96 per dollar,
compared with 53.14 yesterday, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 53.03 from 53.17. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
