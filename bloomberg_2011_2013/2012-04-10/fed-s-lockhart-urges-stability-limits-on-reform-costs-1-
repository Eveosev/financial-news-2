President  Dennis Lockhart  said regulators need to reform the
U.S. financial system to ensure it is safer without imposing too
great a cost on consumers and businesses.  A successful financial overhaul “would be a resilient
financial system with substantially reduced systemic risks and
reduced overall risk of financial instability,” Lockhart said
today at an Atlanta Fed conference in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .
“And it would mean an effective and efficient supervisory-
regulatory system” that serves consumers “while not imposing
excessive costs of compliance on participants.”  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  at the conference yesterday called
for new steps to curb “shadow banking” operating beyond
standard oversight, including money market funds. Following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, Bernanke
flooded the financial system with liquidity by opening
facilities that provided credit to  money market funds , primary
dealers, commercial paper markets, banks and other borrowers.  “Almost two years after the Dodd-Frank act became law,
many rules have not yet been written so much of the detailed
work still lies ahead,” Lockhart said, referring to the law
intended to reform banks and financial firms in response to the
crisis.  “The details of the rules will influence the structure
of the firms” and the financial sector overall.  Lockhart didn’t comment on the  U.S. economy  in his remarks,
other than to observe the past financial crisis caused a “deep
and painful recession.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
