Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, said its industrial-automation business
remains stable at a “high level” while earnings growth
continues to be hampered at its renewable-energy units.  Counter to the company’s forecasts at the beginning of the
fiscal year, Siemens’s industrial-automation division hasn’t
suffered from slowing economies in Europe and  China , said
Wolfram Trost, a spokesman at the Munich-based manufacturer.
Trost was confirming comments Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser
made in an interview with  Euro am Sonntag . Some operations at
the division are performing better than last year, Euro am
Sonntag cited Kaeser as saying.  Renewable-energy projects will continue to weigh on
finances for some time and will also affect the power-
transmission unit, Kaeser said, according to the weekly
newspaper. Siemens booked 203 million euros ($266 million) in
charges in its most recent quarter at the power-transmission
division amid delays connecting offshore wind parks to the  power
grid .  Siemens  fell  as much as 1.6 percent to 72.70 euros and was
trading down 0.6 percent at 10:42 a.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock
has declined 0.6 percent this year.  The company is  forecasting  net income from continuing
operations of about 6 billion euros for the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30. Siemens is sticking to its predictions, Euro am
Sonntag cited Kaeser as saying. Analysts on average expect
Siemens to post profit of 5.61 billion euros, according to
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
