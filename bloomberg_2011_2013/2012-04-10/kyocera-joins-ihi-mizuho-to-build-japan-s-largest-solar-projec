Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese solar
panel maker,  IHI Corp. (7013)  and  Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. (MIZC)  plan to
jointly construct a 70-megawatt plant powered by the sun, the
largest to be built in the country.  The companies reached an initial agreement to build the
plant in Kagoshima prefecture in southern  Japan  at a cost of 25
billion yen ($307 million), they said in a  statement  today.
Construction will start in July.  Japan plans to start a feed-in tariff program in July,
prompting companies including  Softbank Corp. (9984)  to announce plans
for solar plants to take advantage of the above-market rates for
power generated from renewable sources. “Expectations and
interest in solar energy have heightened to a new level in
Japan,” the companies developing the Kagoshima project said in
the statement.  Kyocera will supply solar panels and undertake part of the
construction and maintenance of the plant, according to the
statement. IHI, a Japanese maker of heavy machinery, will lease
the land and Mizuho will help arrange financing for the project.  KDDI Corp. (9433) ,  Kyudenko Corp. (1959)  and  Kagoshima Bank Ltd. (8390)  are
among companies that are also expected to invest in the project,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
