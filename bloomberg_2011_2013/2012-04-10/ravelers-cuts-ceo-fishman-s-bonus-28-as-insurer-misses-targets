Travelers Cos. cut Chief Executive
Officer Jay Fishman’s bonus 28 percent after missing financial
goals in the insurer’s least profitable year since 2004.  Fishman’s award was reduced to $4.5 million from $6.25
million in 2010, the New York-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. Total compensation, including stock and
option awards, fell to $16.5 million from $19.8 million.  “The cash bonus amounts reflect the fact that the company
did not achieve its 2011 target for unadjusted operating return
on equity, and operating income per share declined from 2010
levels,” according to the filing.  Fishman, who is also chairman, cut about 1,400 jobs last
year, or 4.4 percent of the workforce, as costs from natural
disasters and near-record low bond yields pressured results. Net
income slipped to $1.43 billion last year from $3.22 billion in
2010. Travelers said that some of the decline was beyond the
control of mangers who showed “superior individual
performance.”  Travelers advanced 6.2 percent in New York trading last
year, compared with the 5.5 percent advance in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average .  To contact the reporter on this story:
