Thailand ’s baht rose to its
strongest level in almost a week after global investors pumped
money into the nation’s assets on optimism the economy is
recovering from last year’s floods.  International funds bought $87 million more Thai equities
than they sold last week, taking net purchases this year to $2.8
billion, according to exchange data.  Consumer confidence  rose
for a fourth month in March, a report from the University of the
Thai Chamber of Commerce shows.  Exports (THNFEXPY)  increased 1.2 percent in
February from a year earlier, halting four months of decreases,
Bank of Thailand data showed on March 30.  “With plenty of liquidity in the developed nations, funds
will flow into emerging  Asia ,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo .
“Thailand’s exports are showing signs of recovery and that is
quite positive for the baht.”  The baht advanced 0.2 percent from April 5 to 30.95 per
dollar as of 3:16 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 30.90, the strongest level since April 4.
Local financial markets were closed for public holidays on April
6 and yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
foreign-exchange swings used to price options, was unchanged at
4.52 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2017 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.69
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
