A fraud suit against  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  filed by German lender Bayerische Landesbank over losses
on about $2.1 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities
was moved to a federal court, according to a filing.  The Munich-based bank, the second-biggest German state-
owned lender, sued in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan 
on Nov. 21, accusing JPMorgan and units including Bear Stearns &
Co. of concealing the truth about the quality of the loans
underlying the securities.  The lawsuit was moved to U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
according to documents filed in the state court yesterday. The
move was proper because under federal banking law, federal
courts have jurisdiction over civil actions involving
transactions with foreign banks, New York-based JPMorgan said in
the court filings.  The case is  Bayerische Landesbank  New York Branch v. Bear
Stearns & Co., 653239/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
