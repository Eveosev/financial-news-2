Chicago gasoline fell against
futures for a sixth straight day as refiners offered products
processed from cheaper crude with production at the highest
level for this time of year in two decades.  “They don’t care about basis, they care about cracks,” or
the profit margin for converting crude oil into gasoline and
other products, said Steve Mosby, vice president of ADMO Energy
LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City , Missouri.  Refiners in the Midwest  processed  3.37 million barrels a
day, the most since 1992 for this time of year, according to the
Energy Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago (CHCG87PC)  versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  widened 4 cents to 37.5 cents a gallon at 12:41 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The discount was 4.75
cents on March 30. Prompt delivery rose 1.37 cents to $2.9854.  Canadian oils used by Midwest refiners returned this month
to the lowest discounts to West Texas Intermediate, the U.S.
benchmark crude, since October, increasing profits from
producing fuel.  Refiners will keep processing more fuel until the
difference narrows between WTI and European-benchmark Brent oil,
Mosby said. The spread narrowed to $18.86 a barrel today from
$20.21 yesterday.  The same fuel in the  Midwest (GRP3G387) , or Group 3, widened its
discount 0.5 cents to 19.75 cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  restored power at the 135,000-barrel-a-
day Meraux refinery in  Louisiana  after a blackout that shut
process units. Electricity resumed at around 11 a.m. local time,
about an hour and a half after it was lost,  Bill Day , a San
Antonio-based spokesman for Valero, said in an e-mail.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  held at 3.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
