U.S. soybean  inventories  before the
next harvest will be 9.1 less than forecast a month earlier as
smaller crops in  South America  boost export demand, the
government said. Futures in Chicago were forecast to open
higher.  Supplies will total 250 million bushels (6.81 million
metric tons) by Aug. 31, the end of the marketing year, down
from 275 million projected in March, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. The average estimate of 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 242 million bushels. Combined
output in Brazil and Argentina will fall 3.5 percent this year
to 111 million tons, the USDA said.  “The large decline in South American production has
allowed U.S. soybeans to be competitive,” boosting the pace of
exports,  Dan Cekander , the director of grain research at Newedge
USA LLC, said in a report on April 5.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, futures may advance 8 cents
to 10 cents a bushel at the 9:30 a.m. opening on the supply
data,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity
Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.
The contract for May delivery rose 0.7 percent to $14.41 at 7:14
a.m.. The commodity has gained 19 percent this year.  Smaller inventories may boost prices for a range of
products including livestock feed, a key expense for meat
producers such as  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)   Exports Increase  U.S. soybean production in 2011 was 3.056 billion bushels,
unchanged from last month’s estimate, the USDA said. The USDA
raised its projection for U.S. exports in the current marketing
year to 1.29 billion bushels from 1.275 billion in March. That
compares with 1.501 billion shipped in the previous year.  World soybean production  will total 240.15 million tons,
down from 245.07 million tons forecast a month ago, the USDA
said. That’s a drop from last year’s production of 264.22
million tons.  Brazil’s crop  will be 66 million tons, down from 68.5
million projected in March and less than the 75.5 million
harvested a year ago, the USDA said.  Argentina’s (US38PRAR)  production was estimated at 45 million tons,
down from 46.5 million forecast in March and less than last
year’s harvest of 49 million tons.  Brazil ’s exports will reach 35.7 million tons, down from
36.9 million forecast in March and 29.95 million a year earlier,
according to the report. Argentina, the biggest shipper of soy-
based cooking oil and animal feed, will export 8.6 million tons
of soybeans, down from 8.9 million forecast last month and 9.21
million a year ago.  World inventories  on Sept. 30 will be 55.52 million tons,
down from 57.3 million forecast in March and down from a record
69.12 million a year earlier, the USDA said. The average
estimate of 19 analysts surveyed was for 55.34 million tons.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, with a 2011
value of $35.8 billion, behind corn at $76.5 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
