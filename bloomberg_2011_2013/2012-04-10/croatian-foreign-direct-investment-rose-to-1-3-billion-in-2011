Croatian foreign direct investment
rose to 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in 2011 from 295 million
euros in 2010, the  central bank  said today in a statement on its
website, citing preliminary data.  Croatia , which is preparing to become the  European Unionâ€™s 
28th member in July 2013, is struggling to recover from a two-
year recession. The economy contracted 0.4 percent from a year
earlier in the fourth quarter of 2011, with output unchanged
during the whole of that year. FDI was 4.2 billion euros in
2008.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
