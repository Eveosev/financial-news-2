Soybeans rose in Chicago before a
U.S. government report that may forecast smaller global stocks
of the oilseed after drought damaged crops in  South America .  Inventories at the end of the 2011-12 crop year may be 55.3
million metric tons, the average estimate of analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg shows. That compares with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s March estimate of 57.3 million tons and 68.8
million tons last year. The USDA will report its latest supply
and demand outlook at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  “The market is clearly geared toward what’s expected in
the USDA numbers,”  Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at
National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from  Melbourne .  Soybeans for May delivery climbed 0.5 percent to $14.3875 a
bushel by 12:30 p.m. Paris time on the Chicago Board of Trade,
gaining for a third session in four. The most-active contract is
up 19 percent this year.  Output (US38PRBR)  in  Brazil , the second-largest soybean producer, may
reach 66.8 million tons, smaller than the 68.5 million tons
forecast by the USDA last month and last year’s record 75.5
million tons, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  Soybean shipments into leading global importer  China  were
4.83 million tons last month, higher than February’s 3.83
million tons and above the year-ago total of 3.51 million,
customs figures showed today. In the first quarter, shipments
totaled 13.33 million tons, according to the data.  The USDA will also release its latest supply and demand
estimates for corn and wheat. Corn for May delivery rose 0.7
percent to $6.5375 a bushel and wheat for delivery in the same
month advanced 0.6 percent to $6.4675 a bushel.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris added 0.1 percent to 205 euros ($268.14) a ton. The spread
over December-delivery wheat traded in  Chicago  narrowed to
$16.29 a ton from $17.42 on April 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
