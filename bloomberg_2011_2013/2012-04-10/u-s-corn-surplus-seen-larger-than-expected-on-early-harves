The U.S.  corn surplus  on Aug. 31
will be larger than analysts expected as more wheat is used to
feed livestock and as farmers start the harvest early after a
warmer-than-usual spring in the Midwest, the government said.  Unsold supplies at the end of the marketing year, when the
harvest is normally just getting under way, will total 801
million bushels, unchanged from the March forecast and down from
1.128 billion a year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. The average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News was for 715 million bushels after
consumption in the three months through February unexpectedly
rose.  “USDA is saying that rising wheat supplies will bridge the
gap in corn supplies before the U.S. harvest begins,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president of the Linn Group in
 Chicago , said before the report. “Corn supplies are tight, and
that will increase attention on crop conditions and weather
forecasts the next three months.”  Corn futures for May delivery fell 1.4 percent to $6.49 a
bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. The commodity
has dropped 16 percent in the past year on forecasts that world
wheat reserves will rise to the highest since 2002.  Larger-than-expected corn inventories may limit cost
increases for processors of corn-based ethanol such as  Archer
Daniels Midland Co. (ADM)  and for meat companies including  Smithfield
Foods Inc. (SFD)  and  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , which say  animal feed  made from
the grain is their biggest expense.  About 4.6 billion bushels will be used for animal feed, 5
billion for ethanol and 1.7 billion for exports, the department
said, all unchanged from last month’s estimates.  The USDA’s estimate of 12.358 billion bushels for the 2011
crop was unchanged and down 0.7 percent from a year earlier. It
was the smallest harvest since 2008. The government is scheduled
to release its first forecast for this year’s crop next month.  World corn production  in the marketing year that ends Sept.
30 will total 864.97 million metric tons, little changed from
864.96 million forecast in March. A year earlier, output was a
record 828.97 million tons.  Global consumption will reach 867.29 million tons, down
from 869.49 million estimated last month and an increase from
848.06 million last year, the USDA said. It would be the third
straight year that consumption exceeds production.  World inventories  before this year’s harvest in the
Northern Hemisphere will total 122.71 million tons, down from
124.53 million tons estimated in March and less than 125.02
million in the previous year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News expected 122.04 million, on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
