The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated
 Milwaukee  109-89 to boost the New York Knicks’ and Philadelphia
76ers’ chances of making the National Basketball Association
playoffs at the expense of the Bucks.  Russell Westbrook had 26 points and seven rebounds, while
Kevin Durant scored 19 points and had eight assists for the
Thunder (42-15), who have clinched a postseason berth as winner
of the Western Conference’s Northwest Division.  The defeat leaves the Bucks in ninth place in the Eastern
Conference with a 28-29 record, 1 1/2 games behind the Knicks
and 76ers, who both have 29-27 records. The top eight teams in
each conference reach the postseason.  The Bucks host the Knicks tomorrow. The 76ers travel to
Milwaukee on April 25 in those teams’ next-to-last regular-
season game.  The Knicks face the Bulls tonight in  Chicago . New York
spoiled NBA Most Valuable Player Derrick Rose’s return from a
12-game injury absence with a 100-99 overtime win at Madison
Square Garden against the Bulls two nights ago.  The Thunder moved a game ahead of San Antonio (40-15) atop
the Western Conference after the Utah Jazz won 91-84 last night
to end the Spurs’ 11-game winning streak.  Nuggets Keep Advantage  The  Phoenix Suns  (30-27) defeated the Minnesota
Timberwolves 114-90 to remain a game behind the  Denver Nuggets 
in ninth place in the Western Conference. The Nuggets (31-26)
routed the Golden State Warriors 123-84.  The NBA champion Dallas Mavericks, who yesterday agreed to
part ways with  Lamar Odom  after four months, also have a 31-26
record.  Also last night, the  Los Angeles Lakers  (36-22) defeated
the New Orleans Hornets 93-91 without Kobe Bryant, who missed a
second straight game with a sore left shin.  Pau Gasol  led the
Lakers with 25 points and nine rebounds, while  Andrew Bynum 
contributed 18 points and 11 rebounds.  The Lakers are now 1 1/2 games ahead of the Los Angeles
Clippers (34-23), who lost 94-85 to the Memphis Grizzlies.  The Orlando Magic eased past the Detroit Pistons 119-89,
the Indiana Pacers made it five wins in six games with a 103-98
victory against the Toronto Raptors, the Washington Wizards
defeated the Charlotte Bobcats 113-85 and the Houston Rockets
beat the Portland Trail Blazers 94-89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
