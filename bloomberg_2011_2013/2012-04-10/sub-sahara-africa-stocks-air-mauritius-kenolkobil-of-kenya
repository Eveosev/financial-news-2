The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-
Share Index (NGSEINDX)  snapped three days of gains, retreating 0.7 percent
to 20,788.55 at 4 p.m. in Lagos, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Trading was extended by 90 minutes after being
disrupted earlier in the day, the bourse said.  Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  fell for a second day, dropping 0.1
percent to 60.12 by the close in Nairobi. Mauritius’s  SEMDEX
Index (SEMDEX)  slid 0.1 percent to 1,802.74. The  FTSE/Namibia Overall
Index (FTN098)  rose 0.1 percent to 887.32.  The following shares rose or fell in sub-Saharan Africa,
excluding South Africa. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Air Mauritius Ltd. (AML)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s fourth-
biggest airline, declined 3.1 percent, the most since Feb. 24,
to 12.40 rupees as investors took profits following a 7.6
percent gain yesterday.  “Air Mauritius had a spectacular rise yesterday after
media reports saying that the airline has chosen Seabury APG for
its recovery plan,” said Bhavik Desai, a research analyst at
the city-based Axys Stockbroking Ltd., in a phone interview.
“Now, there’s some profit taking.”  Fan Milk Ltd. (FML)  , a maker of ice cream and frozen
yogurt in Ghana, retreated 1.4 percent, the most since Jan 30,
to 2.20 cedis as investors expect profit growth in the first
quarter was unchanged from a year earlier.  “We don’t expect profit and revenue growth in the first
quarter to be much different from what the company recorded in
the same period last year,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at
Databank Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today.
“Fan Milk’s products have been facing rising competition on the
market from growing substitutes, even ordinary coconut juice can
serve as a substitute.”  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , a Kenyan fuel retailer, fell 0.8
percent to 11.90 shillings, the lowest since March 27. Oil
declined on projections that U.S. stockpiles rose to the highest
level for this time of year since 1990 and as Chinese crude
imports dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
