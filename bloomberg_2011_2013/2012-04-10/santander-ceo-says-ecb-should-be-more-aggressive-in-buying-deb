The  European Central Bank  should be
more aggressive in buying up government debt to boost the
region’s economy,  Banco Santander (SAN)  SA Chief Executive Officer
Alfredo Saenz said.  “It should be a little more aggressive in its monetary
expansion and be more aggressive in purchases of public and
private bank debt,” said Saenz, who helps run Spain’s biggest
bank, at a banking conference in Madrid today. “It would have
to do a stronger policy of European quantative easing.”  More than 800 banks borrowed more than 1 trillion euros
($1.31 trillion) from the ECB’s Long-Term Refinancing Operations
in December and February as the central bank provided the
region’s banks with unlimited funds to avert a credit crunch.  The three-year ECB loans are a “good step” though aren’t
enough to provide a stable financial environment for banks,
Saenz said. It’s also necessary for governments to meet
commitments to the European Union to cut their deficits agreed
with Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
