Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK)  sold 53
percent of its Turkish broker and investment bank as  Africa ’s
largest lender focuses on markets closer to home.  That cut its stake in Standard Unlu to 25 percent, the
Johannesburg-based bank said today in a statement translated
from Turkish. The shares were bought by Turkish businessman
Mahmut Unlu, who raised his shareholding to 75 percent. The
statement didn’t say how much he paid.  “Turkey is an important enough country for us that we are
not pulling out completely,” said Martin Botha, a director at
 Standard Bank .  While  Standard Bank (SBK)  last year said it didn’t plan to sell
the Turkish business, the sale is part of a global strategy that
includes selling assets in Argentina and  Russia , according to
Botha. The lender, which has about $1 billion in surplus capital
after the sales, is trying to improve the profitability of its
operations in Africa.  Standard Bank (SBK)  rose as much as 2.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in more than three months, and closed up 1.2
percent at 112.60 rand in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
