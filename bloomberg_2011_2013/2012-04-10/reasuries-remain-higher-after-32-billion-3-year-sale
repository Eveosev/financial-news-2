     April 10 (Bloomberg) --  Treasury (USGG3YR)  10-year yields fell below
2 percent for the first time in almost a month amid speculation
the European sovereign-debt crisis is worsening as yields on
Spanish and Italian bonds rose.  Treasury securities  remained higher after the U.S. sold $32
billion of three-year notes, with the class of bidders that
includes foreign central banks taking 40 percent of the debt,
its largest share since August. The notes drew a yield of 0.427
percent, compared with a forecast of 0.424 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary
dealers.  “It’s definitely a risk-off day,” said  William O’Donnell ,
head U.S. government bond strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc’s RBS Securities in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of the
primary dealers required to bid at the auctions. “We think it’s
going to continue. The return of European stress has legs.”  The  yield  on the current three-year note fell three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.41 percent, at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 0.375
percent securities maturing in March 2015 rose 3/32, or 94 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 99 29/32.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  fell seven basis
points to 1.98 percent, touching the least since March 7. The
yield hadn’t traded below 2 percent since March 12, the day
before the Fed raised its assessment of the  U.S. economy  in its
March 13 policy statement.  Market Stress  An index of U.S. financial conditions is signaling a
slowdown after having crossed over toward indicating growth on
March 9.  The Bloomberg U.S. Financial Conditions Index has held
below zero since April 6, after the Labor Department said the
economy added 120,000 jobs in March, less-than-forecast. The
measure fell to minus 0.27 after rising as high as 0.24 on March
19. The index touched minus 12.7 during the financial crisis in
October 2008.  At today’s auction, the 40 percent awarded to indirect
bidders compares with an average of 37 percent for the past 10
sales. Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 7.8 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 10.5 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.36,
compared with an average of 3.37 for the past 10 sales.  Auction Watch  “Rates have come down quite a bit and investors haven’t
deserted the auction,” said  Suvrat Prakash , an interest-rate
strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, a primary dealer.
“Investors are taking a bit of a pause after the long rally,
but there was a lot of strong participation. The next few
auctions should go well.”  The Treasury is selling $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week. It’s due to auction $21 billion of 10-year securities
tomorrow and will sell $13 billion of 30-year debt on April 12.  Three-year notes have lost 0.1 percent this year, compared
with a 0.4 percent loss for Treasuries overall, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Trading volume declined yesterday, with about $166 billion
of Treasuries changing hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s
largest interdealer broker, the lowest for a full-day since
March 26. Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest
since August. The average in 2012 is $251 billion.  Yield Differences  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year yields  widened 
to 4.28 percentage points, the most since November, after
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s unexpected announcement
yesterday that he would cut an additional 10 billion-euros ($13
billion) in education and health spending failed to ease concern
in the  bond market  that the nation may become the fourth euro
member to need a bailout.  The Fed has purchased $2.3 billion of mortgage and Treasury
debt in two separate rounds of asset purchases intended to
stimulate the economy, known as quantitative easing.  “There’s renewed concern about Europe, there’s evidence
the economy may be succumbing to higher gasoline prices and a
higher expectation of a Fed QE3 operation,” said  David Coard ,
head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital
Group, a brokerage for institutional investors.  Crude oil for May delivery rose to as high as $102.96 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , and is up.  Profit Outlook  U.S. corporate profit growth stalled in the U.S. last
quarter as companies from McDonald’s Corp. to 3M Co. saw gains
in the world’s largest economy eroded by a slump in  Europe .
Earnings at Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies, excluding
financials, are seen gaining 0.6 percent in the first and the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg, the slowest growth rate since
2009.  The central bank on March 13 reiterated its previous
statement that economic conditions would probably warrant
“ exceptionally low ”  interest rates  at least through late 2014.
It has kept its target rate for overnight bank loans to a range
of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Fed bought $4.76 billion in Treasuries maturing from
April 2018 to November 2019 in its second open-market operation
as part of its plan to lower borrowing costs known as Operation
Twist. Earlier it purchased $1.84 billion of notes due in
February 2036 to May 2041.  The central bank is replacing $400 billion of short-term
debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries to limit
borrowing costs and counter risks of a recession.  The 10-year yield has plunged by more than 40 basis points
in the 15 trading days since reaching an almost-five-month high
of 2.40 percent on March 20.  “The 2.40 was a number of things,” said Gary Pollack,
head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private
Wealth Management unit in New York, which manages $12 billion.
“Resolution on  Greece , more optimism on the economy as well as
the reduced probability of a QE3. All of those three things have
turned, and that’s why you saw a 40-basis-point rally.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
