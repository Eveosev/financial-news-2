SBM Offshore NV (SBMO) , the world’s
biggest supplier of floating oil and gas platforms, dropped the
most more than two months in Amsterdam after the company said
sales practices were being investigated that may have been
improper.  SBM fell 12 percent to 13.68 euros, the biggest decline
since Jan. 24, valuing the Schiedam, Netherlands-based company
at 2.35 billion euros ($3.1 billion).  “Outside counsel and forensic accountants, reporting to
both the Management and Supervisory Boards, have been engaged to
investigate these practices thoroughly,” SBM said today in a
statement. SBM appointed Sietze Hepkema to the board with
immediate effect to oversee corporate governance and compliance.  “SBM creates another uncertainty on its practices today
with releases that it has appointed a governance and compliance
officer,” ING said in a note today. “ING believes this is a
good step for SBM but at the same time creates uncertainty on
how SBM has won certain contracts.”  To contact the editor for this story:
