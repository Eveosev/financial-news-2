Gasoline dropped to a five-week low
on speculation that demand will weaken as U.S. job growth slows
amid higher pump prices.  Futures have declined 2.7 percent in two days since an
April 6 Labor Department report that showed that the U.S. added
the fewest jobs in five months in March. Retail prices are 4.3
percent higher than a year ago. Gasoline is the best performer
this year in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  “You had a bad jobs number and there’s a decent
correlation between payrolls and gasoline consumption,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York . “Gasoline has led the market higher.
Now, it has more the potential to lead the market lower.”  Gasoline for May delivery fell 4.71 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to settle at $3.2496 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures have gained 21 percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, slipped
0.5 cent yesterday to $3.922 a gallon, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring club.  The U.S. added 120,000 jobs last month, fewer than the
205,000 projected in a Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate
declined to a three-year low of  8.2 percent , as people left the
workforce. The participation rate, the share of working-age men
and women with jobs or seeking employment, fell to 63.8 percent
from 63.9 percent in February.  Gasoline Demand  U.S. retail gasoline demand this year through April 6 was
5.3 percent below a year earlier, according to MasterCard Inc.’s
SpendingPulse report today. Consumption will average 8.65
million barrels a day in 2012, down from 8.74 million in 2011,
the Energy Information Administration said today in its monthly
Short-Term Energy Outlook. That’s 20,000 barrels a day below
last month’s projection of 8.67 million.  Gasoline also slid today as crude futures sank amid
projections that U.S. oil supplies reached the highest level for
this time of year since 1990. Crude for May delivery on the
Nymex retreated $1.44 to $101.02 a barrel, the lowest settlement
in eight weeks.  “It’s a combination of economic uncertainty, rising crude
inventories and anemic gasoline demand, said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Iran  and the five permanent members of the  United Nations
Security Council  plus  Germany  are scheduled to hold talks on the
Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear program April 14 after a 15-month
hiatus.  ‘‘People are waiting to see what will happen in the
meetings this weekend,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil
Associates LLC in Houston.  Brent Crude  Brent crude for May settlement fell $2.79 to $119.88 a
barrel on  London ’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, and its premium
to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude narrowed to
$18.86 from $20.21 yesterday. Brent is the benchmark for oil
used in European refineries that export gasoline to the East
Coast.  “Gasoline is more closely tied to Brent than it is to
WTI,” said Vince Lanci, managing partner at Echobay Partners
LLC, a commodity investment firm in  Stamford , Connecticut.
“Gasoline is down because Brent has finally cracked and broken
out of a trading range.”  May-delivery heating oil fell 5.02 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to settle at $3.0957 a gallon on the Nymex, the fourth loss in
five sessions. Prices have gained 5.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
