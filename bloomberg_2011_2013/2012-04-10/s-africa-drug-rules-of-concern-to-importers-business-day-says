South Africa â€™s new state
procurement rules for medication will prejudice importers of
generic drugs,  Business Day  reported, citing the National
Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.  The list of products designated for preferential
procurement from local manufacturers may force small companies
that import medication to lay off staff and lose government
business, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing Charles
Mothata, chief executive officer of the association. About half
its members sell generic drugs, mainly imported from  India .  The new rules would give local manufacturers greater
certainty of a return on their investment in local manufacturing
capacity, the newspaper cited Stavros Nicolaou, spokesman for
Pharmaceuticals Made in SA, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
