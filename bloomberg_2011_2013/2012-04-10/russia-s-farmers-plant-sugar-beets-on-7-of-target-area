Russia’s farmers planted sugar
beets on 85,600 hectares (211,522 acres), or 7 percent of the
target area, the country’s Sugar Producers’ Union  said .  The sown area compared with 115,000 hectares a year
earlier, the union said today on its website. Planting was
hampered by rains in the North Caucasus and Southern Federal
Districts, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
