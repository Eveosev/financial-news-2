Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed will attempt to ensure a regulation aimed
at limiting risk-taking by banks doesn’t impede liquidity in
global financial markets.  “The Volcker rule raises a lot of complexities, including
some international differences,” Bernanke said today in reply
to audience questions after a speech in Stone Mountain, Georgia.  “We have heard a number of concerns made” from regulators
outside the U.S. that liquidity in foreign  government securities 
could be impaired, Bernanke said. The Fed will “support the
market making function and the liquidity in critical financial
markets,” he said.  The so-called Volcker rule, named for its original
champion, former Fed Chairman  Paul Volcker , is aimed at reducing
the odds that banks will make risky investments with their own
capital and put depositors’ money at risk.  Bernanke said on Feb. 29 that the central bank and other
regulators won’t meet the July deadline to complete work on the
Volcker rule. The Fed has received over 17,000 comment letters
on the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
