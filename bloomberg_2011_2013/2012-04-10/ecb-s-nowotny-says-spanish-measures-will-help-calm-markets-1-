European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said  Spain ’s additional budget cuts
will help to calm investors.  “The Spanish government is taking the necessary steps
which will contribute to help calm the markets,” Nowotny told
reporters in Vienna today.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  unexpectedly announced the 10
billion-euro package yesterday, less than two weeks after
unveiling the most austere budget in more than three decades.
Rajoy is targeting basic public services for the first time
since his election in December in a bid to convince investors he
can bring order to the nation’s finances and avert a bailout.  Asked if the ECB would consider a third three-year loan,
Nowotny said that “while you can never rule anything out in
financial markets,” he does not “see any need at this point in
time.”  Nowotny also said it was too early to speculate about the
ECB unwinding its crisis measures.  “Whenever we start a new action we also at the same time
have in mind how to exit it,” he said. “For the immediate time
being I do not see a need to go into further details.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
