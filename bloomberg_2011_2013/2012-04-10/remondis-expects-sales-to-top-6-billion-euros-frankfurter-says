Remondis AG & Co. KG, a closely
held German water and environmental services company, expects
record sales of more than 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion) this
year, fueled by recent acquisitions,  Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung  reported, citing comments by Herwart Wilms, who sits on
the management board of Rethmann AG & Co. KG,  Remondisâ€™ parent
company.  As utilities are considering selling assets, often
including water companies, Remondis may take advantage of such
opportunities, the newspaper said.  Rethmann expects sales of more than 12 billion euros this
year, the newspaper cites Wilms as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
