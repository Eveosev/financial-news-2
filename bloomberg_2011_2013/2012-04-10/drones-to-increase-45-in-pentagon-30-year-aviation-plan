The Pentagon plans to increase its
fleet of armed and long-haul surveillance drones by at least 45
percent over the next 10 years.  The U.S. military’s inventory of unmanned aerial vehicles,
will grow to 645 aircraft in fiscal 2022 from about 445 in
fiscal 2013, including versions of  Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) ’s RQ-4
Global Hawk and General Atomics’ MQ-9 Reaper and MQ-1 Predators,
the Defense Department said in a report required by Congress on
its aviation blueprint for the next 30 years.  In addition, the U.S. Army wants to buy 164 Gray Eagle
drones from closely held General Atomics of  San Diego  from 2013
to 2022 “in direct support of ground forces,” the Pentagon
said in the report obtained today.  Drones are playing an increasing role as the Pentagon seeks
a force that will be “smaller and leaner” and more
technologically advanced, as Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  put
it when he introduced a revamped national security strategy in
January. Even as the inventory of drones grows, the U.S.
military is buying fewer than originally planned because of
reduced budgets, a defense official told lawmakers.  “The military departments adjusted their plans to comply
with a constrained top line by procuring fewer aircraft than
desired,” Deputy Defense Secretary  Ashton Carter  wrote in a
letter to the leaders of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee
on April 4.  Budget Cuts  The Pentagon is cutting $487 billion from its spending over
the next 10 years and may face an additional $500 billion in
cuts if Congress and the Obama administration don’t reach an
agreement on reducing the U.S. deficit.  Northrop Grumman of  Falls Church , Virginia, fell 30 cents
to $59.73 at the close in New York trading and has declined 4.2
percent in the past year.  The Defense Department plans to spend $770 billion on
aviation assets from 2013 to 2022. This includes fighter jets,
attack helicopters, airlift and cargo aircraft, combat search
and rescue aircraft, air refueling planes, bombers, anti-ship
and submarine aircraft, drones, training platforms and other
aircraft used by Special Operations forces.  Annual funding levels will peak at $80 billion in 2022,
according to the Pentagon.  The  Air Force  “plans to continue aggressive funding” for
a new long-range bomber with nuclear capabilities, according to
the aviation report. The bomber would reach its initial
capability in the mid-2020s, according to the Pentagon. The
Defense Department plans to “hold down” the unit cost to
“ensure sufficient production” of 80 to 100 bombers, according
to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
