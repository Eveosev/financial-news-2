Algeria is seeking to buy 50,000
metric tons of milling wheat for shipment in June, according to
two people with direct knowledge of the tender.  The deadline for bids is today, the people said, declining
to be identified because the information isn’t public. Algeria
will import 6.4 million tons of wheat in the 2011-12 season that
ends in June, little changed from a year earlier, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture estimates.  Algeria’s state grain purchases are handled by the Office
Algerien Interprofessionnel de Cereales, also known as OAIC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
