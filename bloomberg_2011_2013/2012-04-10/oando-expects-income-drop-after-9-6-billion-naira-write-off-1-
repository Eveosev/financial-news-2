Oando Plc (OANDO) , a Nigerian energy
company, sees a drop in profit for 2011 after a 9.62 billion
naira ($61 million) write-off, Chief Executive Officer Wale Tinubu said.  The amount covers “impairment of assets,” costs of
acquisitions and other charges, Tinubu said on a conference call
today from Lagos, the commercial capital. Oando hasn’t reported
its full-year earnings for 2011.  Oando shares were little changed, rising 0.05 percent to
19.01 naira by the close of trading today in Lagos. The stock
has declined 13.6 percent this year, compared with a 0.3 percent
increase in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
