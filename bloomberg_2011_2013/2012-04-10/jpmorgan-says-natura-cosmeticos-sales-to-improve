  Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3) , Latin
America’s largest cosmetics maker, will see faster sales growth
as it improves distribution, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “Natura is going through an inflection point in sales,”
Andrea Teixeira, a senior analyst for the bank in  New York , said
in an interview. “Sales will likely recover because of the
distribution and logistics initiatives in the past 12 months.”  Natura’s  revenue  increased 8.9 percent to 5.59 billion
reais in 2011 ($3.05 billion), according to data compiled by
Bloomberg, the slowest growth since at least 2003.  The shares rose 3.8 percent to 41.50 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the biggest advance on the Bovespa, which
fell 1.9 percent today. Natura has gained 14 percent this year.  Teixeira has a neutral rating on the shares and a December
price target of 47 reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
