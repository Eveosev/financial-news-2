Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  declined for a
fourth day after saying Chief Executive Officer Boguslaw Kott
will step down.  The shares lost 2.1 percent to 4.11 zloty at 10:18 a.m. in
Warsaw. The lender, which offered Kott a position on the
supervisory board, plans to appoint a new CEO by June 2013, it
said in a statement today. Kott has headed the Polish unit of
Banco Comercial Portugues SA since it was established in 1989.  To contact the reporter on this story:
