Palm oil stockpiles in Malaysia,
the second-largest supplier after  Indonesia , slumped below 2
million tons in March for the first time in seven months as
production fell from a year earlier. Futures climbed.  Inventories (PASTTOTL)  tumbled 5 percent to 1.96 million tons from
2.06 million tons in February, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said
in a statement today. That was less than the 2.01 million tons
predicted in a Bloomberg survey last week.  Output (PALPCPO)  increased 2.1
percent to 1.21 million tons from 1.19 million tons in February,
and was 14 percent less than a year earlier.  Exports (PAEXCPO)  rose 10.8
percent to 1.34 million tons, it said.  Futures surged on concern that lower inventories may pare
global cooking-oil supplies as a drought cuts soybean production
in  South America . Soybeans can be crushed to make  soybean oil , a
substitute used in everything from candy to fuel.  The supply problem is “very disturbing,”  Ben Santoso , an
analyst with DBS Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte., said by
phone. “We will need to reassess the supply for the whole year
from Malaysia, and this will have an impact on the stock-to-
usage ratio going forward.”  The drop in March output from a year ago suggested some
form of tree stress, said Santoso. Production usually recovers
in March after the seasonally low output months of January and
February.  The June-delivery contract advanced as much as 1.2 percent
to 3,619 ringgit ($1,176) a ton on the  Malaysia  Derivatives
Exchange and was at 3,610 ringgit at 4:09 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures, up 14 percent this year, reached 3,623 ringgit
yesterday, the highest price since March 8, 2011.  Strength ‘Justified’  “The price strength is justified and it will probably stay
strong for quite some time,” said Santoso. “Prices are
supported by supply and demand. Apart from declining crude
prices, there is really not that much downside.”  Oil traded near the lowest price in almost a week in  New
York  on speculation U.S. crude stockpiles rose to the highest
level for this time of year since 1990. The May-delivery
contract was at $102.33 a barrel, down 13 cents, in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Palm oil  exports  from Malaysia increased 7.8 percent to
478,948 tons in the first 10 days of April from the same period
a month earlier, surveyor Intertek said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
