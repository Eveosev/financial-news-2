Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , the
maker of Subaru cars, said the company hasn’t made a decision on
its  China  production plans after  Kyodo News  reported the
automaker may shelve a proposal to build a plant in the country.  “Nothing has been decided,” said Kenta Matsumoto, a
spokesman at Tokyo-based Fuji Heavy. The company is still in
discussions on the matter, he said.  Fuji Heavy may cut its target to sell 180,000 vehicles in
China by March 2016 and instead focus on increasing sales in the
U.S., Kyodo reported today, citing unidentified company
officials. It’s too early for Fuji Heavy to discuss any
revisions to its midterm targets, Matsumoto said.  The carmaker, 16 percent owned by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , has
failed to receive government approval to make vehicles with
China’s  Chery Automobile Co. (CACTZ)  in the country since they submitted
an application last year. The government isn’t approving Fuji
Heavy’s proposal because it considers the company to be part of
Toyota, which already has the maximum of two Chinese partners,
three people familiar with the matter said last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
