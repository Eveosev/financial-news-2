German Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen repeated her call for a mandatory quota for women on
the management and supervisory boards of the country’s biggest
companies,  Bild-Zeitung  reported.  While medium-sized German companies have increased the
share of women in leading positions to 30 percent, exchange-
listed companies have failed more than 10 years to promote an
“adequate” number of women to top positions, the minister told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
