Overseas  investors  sold a net  2.53
billion rupees  ($49.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
paring their investment in the equities this year to 455 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 10.8 billion rupees of shares and sold
13.3 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. Foreign funds purchased a net 11.1
billion rupees of bonds, taking total inflow into debt this year
to 197.1 billion rupees, the data  show . They put 421 billion
rupees in bonds in 2011.  The  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  has risen 12 percent this
year as foreign funds have poured record amounts of money into
Indian shares even as corporate-profit growth slows,  interest
rates  remain at a three-year high, oil prices jump and the
government struggles to tackle a widening fiscal gap.  Foreigners have invested 4.9 trillion rupees in stocks and
1.404 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into the
country in 1993. Financial markets in India were closed on April
5 and 6 for holidays.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
