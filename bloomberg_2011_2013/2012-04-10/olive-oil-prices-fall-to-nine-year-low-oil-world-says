Olive- oil prices  fell to a nine-
year low on record production in Spain and rising stocks,
combined with lower domestic consumption, Oil World reported.  Spanish olive-oil production in 2011-12 is forecast to rise
to 1.56 million metric tons from 1.38 million tons a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based oilseed researcher wrote in a report.  “Producers are now claiming that in many cases prices have
fallen below production costs,” Oil World wrote. “Domestic
consumption of olive oil apparently declined so far this season
as a result of the economic crisis and increased availability of
attractively priced sunflower oil.”  Spain’s olive crop is expected to fall in 2012-13 to a
four-year low on drought and after last year’s “very high”
yields, with output of pressed olive oil falling to between 1.2
million and 1.25 million tons.  Olive oil  prices  in  Spain  for extra-virgin quality dropped
to $2,303 a metric ton on April 4 from $2,348 the previous week,
and down from $2,857 in April 2011, Oil World reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
