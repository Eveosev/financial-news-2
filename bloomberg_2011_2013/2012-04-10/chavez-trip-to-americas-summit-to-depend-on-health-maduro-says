Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
attendance at the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia
this week will depend on his health as he undergoes treatment
for an undisclosed form of cancer, Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said.  “Right now the president is dedicated to his treatment and
recovery with a lot of energy and dedication,” Maduro told
reporters today in Quito. “His health is progressing positively
and everything will depend on what he decides” regarding his
presence at the summit.  Chavez is currently in Cuba receiving radiation therapy
after undergoing a third operation since June to remove a
malignant lesion from his pelvic area. The  Summit of the
Americas  will be held on April 14 and 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
