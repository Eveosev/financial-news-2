Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the
world’s largest petrochemical maker, plans to begin producing
urea in the third quarter of 2014 at a plant being built by its
fertilizer unit.  The facility, called Safco-5, will cost 2 billion riyals
($533 million) and produce 1.1 million metric tons a year, the
parent company, known as Sabic, said in its 2011 annual report.
The plant will be operated by Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co., also
called Safco, Sabic said in the report released yesterday.  Sabic’s steel-manufacturing capacity will increase to 6
million tons a year in 2012, upon completion of a new factory in
the eastern city of Jubail that is to start operation in the
second half, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
