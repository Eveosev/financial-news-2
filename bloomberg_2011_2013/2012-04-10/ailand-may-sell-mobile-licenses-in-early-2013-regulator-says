Thailand ’s telecommunications
regulator said it may sell mobile-phone licenses for services on
the 1800-megahertz frequency early next year.  The auction must take place six months before existing
concessions awarded to True Move Ltd. and Digital Phone Ltd.
expire in September 2013, Settapong Malisuwan, a member of the
National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, said at
a media briefing in Bangkok today. Details of the auction
haven’t been completed, he said.  The regulator appointed a committee today to determine what
will happen to customers of True Move and Digital Phone after
the concessions expire. True Move has 17 million subscribers and
Digital Phone, controlled by  Advanced Info Service Pcl (ADVANC) , has
98,000, Settapong said.  The regulator also plans to auction licenses to provide
high-speed mobile-phone services on the 2.1 gigahertz frequency
by October. The commission plans to divide the spectrum into
nine five-megahertz slots to give smaller companies an
opportunity to bid, he said. Details of the auction will be
completed this month, Settapong said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
