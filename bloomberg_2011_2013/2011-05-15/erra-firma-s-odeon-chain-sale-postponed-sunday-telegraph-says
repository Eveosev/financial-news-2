The sale of Odeon and UCI Finco Plc,
a cinema chain owned by Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., has
been postponed, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.  A delay of the sale follows the 475 million-pound ($769
million) refinancing of Terra Firma’s Odeon debt, which will
provide funds for expansion and to refinance existing loans, the
newspaper said, citing no sources.  Andrew Dowler , an external
spokesman for Terra Firma declined to comment on the report.  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
