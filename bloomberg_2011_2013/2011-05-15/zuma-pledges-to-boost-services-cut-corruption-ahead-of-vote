South Africa ’s President  Jacob Zuma 
pledged that the  African National Congress  will improve
municipalities and cut corruption as the ruling party prepares
for local government elections on May 18.  “We will work to ensure that municipalities have the
resources, skills and capacity to meet the needs of our
people,” Zuma said at a rally in Johannesburg today. “We will
ensure improved and strengthened monitoring and evaluation of
municipalities so that we can detect problems much quicker.”  South Africa has held three local elections since the ANC
won power in 1994 and ended apartheid. As many as 52 percent of
South Africans will support the ANC when they vote on May 18,
 City Press  said today, citing a poll by research company
Markinor.  “Nine cities dominate the national economy, and the ANC
intends to win all of them on Wednesday,” Zuma said. “The
ruling party must govern every metro and every major
municipality to bring about meaningful change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
