The Australian dollar rose from the
lowest level in almost four weeks as stocks and prices of raw
materials erased losses, increasing appetite for currencies of
commodity-exporting countries.  The Aussie earlier declined after a government report
showed home-loan approvals unexpectedly dropped to a 10-year low
in March as higher  interest rates  deterred homebuyers. The
currency fell last week as much as 1.6 percent and gained as
much as 1.1 percent. New Zealand’s dollar weakened for a second
day versus the greenback amid concern European finance ministers
meeting Brussels will struggle to revolve the  Greece ’s debt.  “The Aussie had a volatile range last week and that very
choppy trading could continue this week,” said Derek Mumford, a
Sydney-based director at Rochford Capital, a foreign exchange
and interest-rate risk management firm.  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to $1.0606 at 12:17
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0573 on May 13. It earlier dropped as
much as 0.6 percent to $1.0514, the weakest since April 19. The
currency gained 0.3 percent to 85.68 yen, from 85.42 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 78.40 U.S. cents,
and dropped 0.5 percent to 63.32 yen.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
was little changed after falling earlier as much as 0.4 percent.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed after
dropping 0.5 percent.  The number of loans granted to owner-occupiers to build or
buy houses and flats in Australia dropped 1.5 percent to 44,968
in March, the Bureau of Statistics said in Sydney. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a 2 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
