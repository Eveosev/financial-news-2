NATO should broaden its targets in
 Libya  to include infrastructure supporting  Muammar Qaddafi , the
Sunday Telegraph reported, citing General David Richards, head
of the U.K.â€™s Armed Forces.  Richards wants the NATO governments to increase the range
of targets that its jets are allowed to attack, the newspaper
said. NATO warplanes are currently only allowed to attack
targets considered a threat to the population, including tanks
and artillery, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
