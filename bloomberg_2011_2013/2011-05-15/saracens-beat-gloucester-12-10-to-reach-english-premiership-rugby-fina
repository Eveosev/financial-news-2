Saracens set up a repeat of last
season’s Premiership rugby union final against Leicester after a
12-10 victory today against Gloucester.  Teenage fly-half Owen Farrell kicked all the points for
Saracens with four penalties at Vicarage Road in Watford. Nicky
Robinson got Gloucester’s points, from a converted try and a
penalty.  Saracens finished the regular season with 10 straight wins
to take  second position in the standings  behind Leicester. The
top four then compete in the playoffs to decide the winner of
the title.  Yesterday, Leicester beat Northampton 11-3 to reach a
seventh straight Premiership final. The Tigers defeated Saracens
33-27 last year.  The final will be played May 28 at Twickenham Stadium in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
