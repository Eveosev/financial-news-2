Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA)  is considering
selling its unprofitable U.K. chain Comet and delisting its
shares from the London Stock Exchange, the Sunday Times said,
without saying where it got the information.  Kesaâ€™s board discussed a range of options with Knight Vinke
Asset Management LLC, which owns an 18 percent stake in the
retailer, according to the newspaper. Kesa would trade its
shares in Paris and focus on Darty, its profitable French chain,
the Sunday Times said.  Knight Vinke declined to comment, the Sunday Times said.  A spokesman for Kesa declined to comment when contacted by
telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
