CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s largest
power producer, is considering building a coal-fired plant in
 Germany  at a cost of more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion),
Chief Executive Officer Martin Roman said.  Building such a plant at the site of Mibrag, where the
utility owns a coal mine, is “one of the options,” Roman said
in a debate on state-owned Czech Television today. The decision
will depend also on whether the German government agrees to shut
down some nuclear stations and provide incentives for energy
companies to build alternative power sources, he said.  CEZ plans to invest about 300 billion koruna ($17.4
billion) over the next five years, most of which will be spent
on projects in the  Czech Republic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
