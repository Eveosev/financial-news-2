South Korea ’s Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co. started work today on a $219 million project to
expand a gas-fired power station near Baghdad, an Iraqi
Electricity Ministry spokesman said.  The Al-Quds station located in a suburb northeast of the
capital will increase production to 1,400 megawatts from 900
megawatts after 18 months, said Qais al-Waeli, spokesman for the
ministry’s gas projects.  Iraq still struggles with severe electricity shortages
eight years after the U.S.-led invasion that ousted President
 Saddam Hussein . The government has sought bids this year for the
construction of more than 60 power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
