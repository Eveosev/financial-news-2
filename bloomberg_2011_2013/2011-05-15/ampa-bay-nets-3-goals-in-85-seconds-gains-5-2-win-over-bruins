The Tampa Bay Lightning scored three
goals in 85 seconds en route to a 5-2 win over the  Boston  Bruins
in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals.  Dwayne Roloson made 31 of 33 saves for the Lightning in the
game at TD Garden in Boston as Tampa took the early advantage in
the best-of-seven series.  Tampa’s Sean Bergenheim opened the scoring at 11:15 of the
first period after a rebound, when Boston’s Dennis Seidenberg
lost his stick and tried to kick the puck away from the net,
only to put it right onto Bergenheim’s stick.  Brett Clark scored 19 seconds later, skating with the puck
from end to end before backhanding a shot past Bruins goaltender
Tim Thomas.  Lightning right wing Teddy Purcell made it 3-0 just over a
minute later, stealing the puck from Tomas Kaberle behind the
Bruins’ net and stuffing it past Thomas.  Tyler Seguin put Boston on the scoreboard with just over
four minutes left in the period, carrying the puck through
Tampa’s defensemen before shooting it past Roloson on the low
glove side.  After a scoreless second period, Lightning defenseman Marc- Andre Bergeron scored on a power-play slap shot in the third.
 Simon Gagne  scored an empty-net goal in the closing minutes, and
Boston’s Johnny Boychuk added a late goal in the loss.  Game 2 is May 17 in Boston. The Western Conference finals
open today as the Vancouver Canucks host the  San Jose Sharks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
