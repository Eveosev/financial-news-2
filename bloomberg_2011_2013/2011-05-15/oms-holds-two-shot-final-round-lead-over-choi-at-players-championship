David Toms leads K.J. Choi and  Nick
Watney  by two shots with six holes to play at golf’s Players
championship.   Toms, the 2001 PGA Championship winner, is 13-under par for
the tournament at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.  Graeme McDowell, who began the fourth round in a one-shot
lead at 12-under, has dropped back to 10-under alongside  Paul
Goydos  and Luke Donald.   McDowell, the U.S. Open champion, was among 40 players who
had to complete their third round this morning, following a 4
1/2-hour rain delay yesterday. McDowell shot a 4-under-par 68.  Golf’s richest tournament, with a purse of $9.5 million, is
being played without Tiger Woods, who withdrew nine holes into
the opening round with knee and ankle injuries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
