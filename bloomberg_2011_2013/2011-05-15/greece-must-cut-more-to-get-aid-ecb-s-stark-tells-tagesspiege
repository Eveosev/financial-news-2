European Central Bank Executive Board
member Juergen Stark said that further aid for  Greece  should be
conditional on the country “making more consolidation
efforts,”  Der Tagesspiegel  newspaper reported, citing an
interview to be published Monday.  Stark said that a restructuring of Greek debt would make
the situation worse and that the crisis hadn’t damaged the euro,
which was a “highly regarded” international currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
