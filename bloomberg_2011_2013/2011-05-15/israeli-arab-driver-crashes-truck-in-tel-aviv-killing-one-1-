An Israeli Arab truck driver crashed
into several vehicles in  Tel Aviv , killing one person and
injuring five, before he was arrested by police.  The driver, a resident of the Arab town Kafr Kassem, said
he lost control of the truck and the collision was an accident,
police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said in a telephone interview.  “Police are looking into whether the accident was
deliberate,” Rosenfeld said.  The incident occurred on the anniversary of what
Palestinians call the “Nakba,” or catastrophe, referring to
their displacement in 1948 as a result of the creation of the
state of Israel. Israelis celebrated their 63rd Independence Day
last week, corresponding with the date on the lunar Hebrew
calendar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
