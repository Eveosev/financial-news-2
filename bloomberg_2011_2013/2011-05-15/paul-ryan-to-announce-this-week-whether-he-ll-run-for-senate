U.S. House Budget Committee Chairman
 Paul Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican, said yesterday that he would
decide this week whether he will run next year for the U.S.
Senate seat being vacated by Wisconsin Democrat  Herb Kohl .  “I plan on making an announcement very quickly,” Ryan,
41, said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “Herb just announced
this Friday. It was a bit of a surprise to all of us” and “we
just started digesting this.”  Kohl, 76, said May 13 that he would not seek what would
have been his fifth term, making him the fifth Senate Democrat
to announce his retirement before the 2012 elections. Senator
Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who caucuses with
Democrats, also is not running for re-election. Republicans hold
47 of the Senate’s 100 seats and would need to pick up four
additional seats to control the chamber.  Ryan, his party’s unofficial spokesman on economic and
budget issues, is considered a  rising star  among Republicans. He
gave the party’s response earlier this year to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address. He also is perhaps most
responsible for pushing fellow Republicans to embrace plans to
overhaul the Medicare health-care program as part of the budget
measure for fiscal year 2012 approved last month by the House.  Other potential candidates for Kohl’s seat include former
Wisconsin Senator  Russ Feingold , a Democrat who last year lost
to Republican  Ron Johnson  in his bid for a fourth term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
