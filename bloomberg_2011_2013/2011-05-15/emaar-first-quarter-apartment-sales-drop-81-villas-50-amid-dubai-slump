Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the  United
Arab Emirates ’ biggest developer by market value, said revenue
from apartment sales declined 81 percent in the first quarter
and from villa sales 50 percent amid weak property demand.  Income from apartment sales dropped to 375 million dirhams
($102 million) and from villas to 60 million dirhams, according
to Emaar’s  earnings statement  posted on the  Dubai Financial
Market  today. Overall revenue fell 31 percent to 1.98 billion
dirhams in the first quarter, while profit slumped 45 percent.
Emaar reported first-quarter earnings on April 24 and provided a
breakdown of revenue today.  Emaar will need to "start relying more on international
projects" to compensate for a decline in apartment deliveries in
Dubai, said Majed Azzam, a Dubai-based analyst at AlembicHC
Securities. Prices and margins are lower in international
markets and Emaar’s earnings will be "hit this year, until the
company resumes sales in Dubai," he said today.  The company, the developer of the  world’s tallest tower  in
Dubai, was hurt by a more than 60 percent slump in property
prices in its home market as speculative demand waned and banks
tightened lending since mid-2008. Emaar’s sales in the U.A.E.
contributed 79 percent of revenue in the first quarter compared
with 96 percent a year earlier, according to today’s statement.  Emaar’s shares fell as much as 1.9 percent to 3.16 dirhams
and were trading 1.2 percent lower at 11:55 a.m. in Dubai today.
The stock has dropped 10.4 percent this year compared with a 2.6
drop in the Dubai Financial Market General Index.  Land sales  The company’s sales of commercial units and land plots rose
16-fold to 704 million dirhams, while revenue from the
hospitality business advanced 41 percent to 335.8 million
dirhams, according to the statement. Rental income from leased
properties like shopping malls gained 8.5 percent to 507.5
million dirhams.  Emaar said on April 24 its first-quarter profit of 421
million dirhams was driven by hotels and malls as well as the
handover of about 270 apartments in Burj Khalifa, the world’s
tallest tower, and Boulevard Plaza. That missed the average
estimate of six analysts for a profit of 567 million dirhams.  House prices  in the U.A.E. may drop an additional 25
percent to 30 percent as population growth stagnates and more
properties are put onto the market, according to a report by
Dubai-based Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd. in March. Emaar said on
May 7 it formed a team of senior managers and external
consultants to develop a five-year action plan for the company.  To contact the reporters on this story: Arif Sharif in Dubai at
