Corn and soybeans may rise this week
as wet weather from  Ohio  to North Dakota delays spring planting.  Sixteen of 23 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on May 13 said corn will rise, and 16 of 24 respondents
forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the Chicago Board of
Trade, corn futures for July delivery fell 0.6 percent to $6.82
a bushel. Soybeans for July delivery rose 0.3 percent to $13.295
a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s decline in corn was a surprise to the majority
of respondents surveyed on May 6, while analysts expected the
gain in soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 16    Bullish on soybeans: 16
Bearish on corn:  7    Bearish on soybeans:  8  To contact the reporter on this story:
