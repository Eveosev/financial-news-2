The U.K.’s HM Revenue & Customs high
net worth unit almost doubled its collections in the past year,
the Sunday Times reported, without citing anyone.  The unit, which investigates the financial affairs of the
country’s richest 5,000 people, got 162 million pounds ($262
million) in the year 2010-2011 compared with 82 million pounds a
year earlier, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
