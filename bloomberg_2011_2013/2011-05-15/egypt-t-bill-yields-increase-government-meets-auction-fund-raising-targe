Yields on  Egypt ’s three-month and
nine-month treasury-bills rose to their highest levels in more
than two-years as the government met its target of raising 5.5
billion Egyptian pounds ($927 million) at an auction today.  The  Ministry of Finance  sold 2 billion pounds in 91-day
bills at an average yield of 11.603 percent, compared with
11.564 percent at the previous sale similar maturity securities
on May 8. The average yield on 259-day notes rose 9 basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 12.856 percent from last
week’s auction.  “This is a trend I expect to go on for a while,” said
Moustafa Assal, head of the fixed-income unit at Cairo-based
Beltone Financial. “It’s maybe a year or two before yields
decline to pre-revolution levels because the economy is relying
on the state for funding, which is causing an excess supply of
treasury-bills.”  Egypt’s economic decline and widening  budget deficit 
following the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  in February have
pushed yields higher, making it more expensive to raise funds.
The government raised 5.3 billion pounds in a Treasury bill sale
on May 12, 700 million pounds less than its target.  The yield on Egypt’s 10-year dollar bond maturing in April
2020 fell 10 basis points to 6.26 percent at 3:54 p.m. in Cairo.
The Egyptian pound was little changed at 5.9350 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
