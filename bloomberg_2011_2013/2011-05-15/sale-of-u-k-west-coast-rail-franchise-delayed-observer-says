A planned auction of the rail
franchise that Virgin Trains operates between London and
Glasgow, Scotland, has been delayed by Transport Secretary
Philip Hammond, the Observer reported, without citing anyone.  The U.K. Department for Transport plans to revise the
country’s rail contracts and told bidders that a new agreement
for the so-called West Coast line would not start until January
2013, instead of April 2012 as originally planned, the newspaper
reported. The bidders shortlisted for the contract are
 FirstGroup Plc (FGP) , Dutch-owned operator Abellio, SNCF of  France  and
Virgin Trains, a joint venture between Richard Branson’s Virgin
Group and  Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC) , according to the Observer.
Virgin Trains has operated the line since 1997.  To contact the reporter on this story:
