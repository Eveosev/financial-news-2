Darren Clarke scored a final-round
69, 1-under par, to come from four strokes behind and win golf’s
Iberdrola Open in Mallorca today.  The Northern Irishman, who finished on 6-under-par 274,
finished three shots ahead of English duo Chris Wood and David Lynn. Clarke’s 13th European Tour title brought him a check for
166,660 euros ($235,000)  Wood, 23, seeking a first win on the Tour, began the day
with a four-shot lead but saw his chances dissolve with a 6-
over-par final round of 76, including five bogeys on the back
nine.  “It’s a bit of a monkey to get off my back after three
years not winning so it’s good,” Clarke was cited as saying on
the European Tour website. “At the same time I feel a lot for
Chris Wood. He’s a young guy, a great player and I’ve been in
his position before.”  Earlier today, Berry Henson of the U.S. won the Philippine
Open in  Manila  for his first victory on the Asian Tour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
