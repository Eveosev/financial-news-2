David Toms leads by K.J. Choi by two
shots with nine holes to play at golf’s  Players  championship.  Toms is 14-under par for the tournament at TPC Sawgrass in
 Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida, after playing the opening nine holes
of the final round in 2-under par.  Graeme McDowell, who began the fourth round in a one-shot
lead at 12-under, has dropped back to 10-under alongside  Paul Goydos  and Nick Watney.  McDowell, the U.S. Open champion, was among 40 players who
had to complete their third round this morning, following a 4
1/2-hour rain delay yesterday. McDowell shot a 4-under-par 68.  Golf’s richest tournament, with a purse of $9.5 million, is
being played without Tiger Woods, who withdrew nine holes into
the opening round with knee and ankle injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
