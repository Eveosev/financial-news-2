D. Medical Industries Ltd. climbed to
the highest level in a week after the developer of drug-delivery
devices said a unit received a license from Health Canada to
sell its Spring Universal Infusion sets in that country.  The shares increased 4 percent to 16.46 shekels, the
highest intraday level since May 8, as of 11:32 a.m. in  Tel
Aviv . That gives the Ramat Gan, Israel-based company a market
value of 128 million shekels ($36 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
