German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said extending the maturities of Greek bonds may be a
way to help ease the country’s debt crisis if private investors
participate.  While it’s too early to say whether more help is needed,
“extra measures” may be needed if Greece can’t return to
financial markets next year as planned under the European-led
aid program agreed last year, Schaeuble said in an interview
with ARD  television  in Berlin today.  “A central point” in any extension of maturities is to
avoid “the private sector steadily withdrawing from its
positions” and shifting the burden to taxpayers, he said.
“That’s why we need clear rules: If there is an extension, then
everyone has to be extended.”  As euro-area finance ministers prepare to discuss the
resurgence of the Greek debt crisis in Brussels tomorrow,
Schaeuble pressed the government to do its part and stay the
course on its pledge of finding 50 billion euros ($70.6 billion)
in privatization revenue.  “This privatization program hasn’t been done yet, but it
has to be worked on,” he said in remarks that the broadcaster
later edited out for length. The aid “program for  Greece  only
makes sense if we get to the point that Greece can return to the
markets, and that’s why it must be followed very closely.”  A “full-blown restructuring” by Greece or the country’s
exit from the euro area would create an “exceptionally
difficult” situation that would be “hard to control,”
Schaeuble said. “That is why we are concentrating” on
preserving the currency union, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
