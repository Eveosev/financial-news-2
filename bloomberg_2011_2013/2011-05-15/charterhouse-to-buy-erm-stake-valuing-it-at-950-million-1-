Environmental Resources Management
Group said London-based private equity firm Charterhouse Capital
Partners LLP agreed to acquire a majority 65 percent stake in
the company valuing it at $950 million.  It’s part of a management buy-out from Bridgepoint Capital
Ltd. and the remaining shares will be held by ERM partners whose
approval is required for the transaction, ERM said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “The company has grown to a size and leading market
position that makes this the ideal time for Charterhouse to make
an investment in the significant growth potential of this world-
class business,” Stuart Simpson, a founder and senior partner
at Charterhouse, said in the statement.  Bridgepoint Capital agreed to purchase its stake in ERM
from 3i Group Plc in a transaction valuing the company at $535
million to benefit from growing environmental protection
legislation in 2005.  ERM provides environmental, health, safety and social
consulting services with 3,600 employees in 40 countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
