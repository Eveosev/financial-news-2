South Korean President  Lee Myung Bak 
expects the Asian nation’s trade with  Germany  and France to
double in coming years as a free-trade agreement with the
European Union takes effect in July.  The pact will help increase trade with Germany to more than
$50 billion within five years from $25 billion in 2010, Lee said
today in a biweekly radio address after a weeklong trip to
Europe. Lee is also seeking to double trade with France in two
to three years, from $7.3 billion last year, he said. He held
talks with counterparts  Angela Merkel  and Nicholas Sarkozy
during the visit.  South Korean lawmakers in May passed a free-trade agreement
with the EU, enabling the world’s second-biggest trade deal to
come into effect on July 1. The EU-Korea pact will expand their
70 billion euro ($100 billion) trade relationship by making 99
percent of commerce duty-free within five years.  The vote comes as  South Korea  prepares to ratify a trade
accord with the U.S., which had been stalled by legislators
since it was signed in 2007 over U.S. demands for improved
access for its cars and beef. The two nations agreed in December
to change provisions in the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
