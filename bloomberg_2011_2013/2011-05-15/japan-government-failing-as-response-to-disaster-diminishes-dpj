The  Democratic Party of Japan  came to
power in 2009 pledging to restore vitality to a country burdened
by deflation, an aging population and the world’s largest debt.
Now, the party itself needs resuscitation.  Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s handling of the March earthquake
and nuclear crisis has exacerbated intra-party divisions and
caused some DPJ lawmakers to suggest he resign. Voter support is
plunging, and the party suffered election setbacks last month.  The Democrats evicted the  Liberal Democratic Party  from a
half-century of rule by  promising  to end political corruption,
reduce the power of the bureaucracy and boost financial aid to
families. Less than two years later, none of those goals has
been accomplished. The DPJ is mired in the same squabbling,
funding scandals and revolving-door cabinets that led voters to
oust the LDP, amid Japan’s worst crisis since World War II.  “The public had enormous expectations for the DPJ,”
senior party lawmaker Hajime Ishii said in an interview. “But
after a year and a half of our government management, they feel
those expectations were betrayed.”  Yukio Hatoyama  was sworn in as the DPJ’s first prime
minister on Sept. 16, 2009, as voters turned their backs on 55
year of one-party rule in what academics at the time called a
“bloodless revolution.”  Since then, the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average has fallen 6.3
percent while the MSCI AC Asia-Pacific Excluding Japan Index has
risen 27 percent.  Exports Threatened  The yen has gained 12.5 percent against the dollar in the
same period, threatening the competitiveness of such Japanese
exporters as Honda Motor Co. and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and forcing
the government to intervene twice to prevent further increases.  Kan’s approval rating was 26 percent in an Asahi newspaper
poll published today, up five percentage points from a month
ago, while his disapproval rating was 51 percent.  Almost two-thirds of respondents disapproved of Kan’s
response to the March temblor and tsunami that crippled the
Fukushima nuclear power plant, left almost 25,000 people dead or
missing and caused as much as 25 trillion yen ($310 billion) in
damage. The Asahi surveyed 1,996 people on May 14 and 15, and
didn’t provide a margin of error.  DPJ legislator  Yozaburo Ishihara  last month said Kan should
resign if the situation at the plant doesn’t improve, and other
party members expressed dissatisfaction with their leader.  Falling Apart?  “The DPJ is falling apart,” said  Gerald Curtis , professor
of Japanese politics at  Columbia University  in  New York . “It’s
kind of suicidal. A lot of people in the DPJ will lose in the
next election.”  Last month, the DPJ lost seats in head-to-head contests
with the LDP in local assembly, mayoral and gubernatorial
elections.  The DPJ hasn’t made any inroads in attacking Japan’s most
persistent troubles. Public borrowing is set to exceed twice the
size of the economy this year and rise to 210 percent next year,
according to the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. The population is the world’s
oldest, putting pressure on social security programs.  More than a decade of deflation has suppressed  interest
rates , with bond yields at the lowest among 32 global debt
markets tracked by Bloomberg. Ten-year yields hit 1.11 percent
on May 13, the lowest in four months.  In another sign of more continuity with the LDP than
catharsis, the DPJ has adopted a similar approach toward the
 Bank of Japan  -- occasionally pressing the central bank to add
stimulus, while avoiding any push to hold it accountable for
ending deflation.  Bank of Japan  Japan hasn’t seen core consumer prices, which exclude fresh
fruit, rise at the sustained 1 percent pace that BOJ board
members define as  price stability  since the early 1990s.  “The BOJ has repeatedly failed to deliver,” said Naoki Iizuka, a senior economist at Mizuho Securities Co in Tokyo.
“The government should participate in the defining of price
stability, and if the government’s understanding is different
from the BOJ’s, the BOJ should be held to the government’s view
because only politicians are held accountable to voters.”  Several opposition groups came together to form the DPJ in
1998. In 2007, the party won control of the Diet’s less-powerful
upper house in a challenge to the LDP, which had been in power
for all but 10 months since 1955. The primary drivers of the
party included Kan, Hatoyama and Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP
lawmaker.  Bridges to Nowhere  The DPJ appealed to urban voters disenchanted by the LDP’s
reliance on a rural support base it kept loyal by funding
projects including seldom-used tunnels, bridges and train
stations. The Democrats  pledged  to introduce subsidies for
families with children, cut public works spending and lower
corporate taxes. They won a landslide victory in the lower house
in August 2009.  While Hatoyama, 64, pushed through a monthly child
allowance of 13,000 yen, his election pledge to move a U.S.
military base from the island of Okinawa raised the ire of the
Obama administration. His subsequent decision to back down
outraged local residents, caused a coalition partner to leave
the government and prompted him to resign the premiership last
June after nine months.  Ozawa, then the party’s top campaign strategist, quit his
DPJ role after a political funding scandal that led to his
indictment in January. While Ozawa, 68, was suspended from the
DPJ for the duration of his trial, he heads the party’s largest
faction and has been critical of Kan.  “Hatoyama was a disaster,” said  Jeff Kingston , head of
the Asian Studies program at Temple University’s  Tokyo  campus.
“And Ozawa has continued to be a thorn, spreading division.”  No Bond Bill  Six weeks after Hatoyama and Ozawa departed, the DPJ lost
control of the upper house. As a result, Kan has failed to push
through legislation to sell bonds that would fund almost half of
this year’s record 92.4 trillion yen budget.  Kan also abandoned a plan to increase the child stipend to
help fund his initial 4 trillion yen quake rebuilding package.
Plans to lower the corporate tax have been postponed, and the
DPJ has squabbled over whether to raise the national  sales tax .  The premier didn’t help his cause in January when he told
reporters an hour after the announcement that he was
“unfamiliar” with the news that Standard and Poor’s had cut
 Japan ’s sovereign credit rating. Opposition politicians said the
remarks undermined market confidence.  A Bloomberg poll of investors last week showed Kan tied
with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  as the world leader with
the least promising policies. Among Asian investors, 63 percent
were optimistic about Chinese President Hu Jintao, compared with
14 percent saying the same about Kan.  No LDP Love  Displeasure with the DPJ hasn’t translated into support for
the LDP. Today’s Asahi newspaper poll showed the voter support
rate of both parties at 19 percent, with the DPJ gaining two
percentage points from last month and the LDP unchanged. The LDP
lost more assembly seats than it gained in April, mostly to
local parties and independent candidates.  “The LDP is not a danger to the Democrats,” said Steven R. Reed, a political science professor at Chuo University in
Tokyo. “People are still searching for inspiration, and the
Democrats currently aren’t serving that role.”  Kan has had a brush with scandal over a political
contribution from a non-Japanese resident, the same issue that
caused his foreign minister,  Seiji Maehara , to resign. The
cabinet has had three different finance and foreign ministers
during the DPJ’s tenure.  The DPJ’s push to send lawmakers into government ministries
to rein in Japan’s powerful bureaucracy has caused friction as
well. Kan has come under fire for not using the expertise of
public servants in dealing with the nuclear disaster.  Lost Morale?  “It’s impossible for only four or five people to handle a
ministry’s entire affairs,” said  Jiro Yamaguchi , a political
science professor at  Hokkaido University  who has been advising
the DPJ. “There’s no cooperation from bureaucrats, who’ve lost
morale.”  The government said this week it would temporarily increase
the number of cabinet officials by three to cope with the
earthquake and nuclear catastrophe. Kan said he would forgo his
prime minister’s salary until the crisis is contained, while
continuing to draw pay as a member of parliament.  Kan, 64, in the past week publicly called for the closing
of a nuclear power plant and the scrapping of Japan’s energy
policy without going through bureaucratic channels, moves that
drew criticism from the business community.  The head of Japan’s biggest business lobby,  Hiromasa Yonekura , criticized Kan’s “abrupt” request for Chubu Electric
Power Co. to halt all its nuclear reactors without consulting
business groups, communities and people involved.  ‘A Black Box’  “What I don’t understand in the DPJ government era is that
a conclusion is suddenly announced, and the thinking process is
left in a black box,” Yonekura said at a May 9 press briefing.  As a result, the “historic change” Hatoyama cited in the
DPJ’s victory has yet to materialize. Party legislator Ishii
said it’s too early to judge the results, saying “reform cannot
be completed in a year or two,” and asking voters to be
patient.  That patience seems to be running out.  “The party hasn’t shown leadership and the public isn’t
listening,” DPJ lawmaker Yoichi Kaneko said in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
