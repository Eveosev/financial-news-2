Ajax, the only publicly traded Dutch
soccer club, won a record-extending 30th Dutch league title today
after a 3-1 home win over  FC Twente .  Siem de Jong scored twice as Ajax finished on 73 points,
two more than Twente. It’s the first time the title has been
decided in one final match between the two contending clubs.
Ajax lost 3-2 to Twente in the Dutch Cup final on May 8 in
Rotterdam.  PSV Eindhoven  finished third after it was held to a 0-0
draw at FC Groningen, giving Twente the second spot and the
possibility of qualifying for the Champions League.  To contact the reporter on this story:
