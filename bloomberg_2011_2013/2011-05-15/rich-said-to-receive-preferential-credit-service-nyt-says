Celebrities, politicians, judges and
other “well-connected” people receive preferential treatment
from credit reporting companies, the New York Times reported,
citing consumer lawyers and legal documents.  “The rich, the well-connected, the well-known and the
powerful” will receive help from U.S.-based workers to fix
their credit reports at  Equifax Inc. (EFX) ,  Experian Plc (EXPN)  and
TransUnion Corp., and errors are usually taken care of
immediately, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified lawyer.  Experian said politicians in an election year may have
their files taken offline so creditors and others can’t access
the information without the bureau’s permission, the newspaper
said. The company said it didn’t have a preferential list, the
Times said.  David Szwak, a consumer lawyer in Shreveport,  Louisiana ,
told the newspaper he has sworn testimony from former Experian
workers that there is a preferential list at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
