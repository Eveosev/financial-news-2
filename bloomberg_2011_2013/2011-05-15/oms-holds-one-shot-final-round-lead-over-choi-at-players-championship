David Toms leads K.J. Choi by one
shot with three holes to play at golf’s Players championship.   Toms, the 2001 PGA champion, is 13-under par for the
tournament at TPC Sawgrass in  Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida.    Paul Goydos, who lost in a playoff to Sergio Garcia at the
Players three years ago, is 11-under, one ahead of Nick Watney
and Luke Donald.  Golf’s richest tournament, with a purse of $9.5 million, is
being played without  Tiger Woods , who withdrew nine holes into
the opening round with knee and ankle injuries.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
