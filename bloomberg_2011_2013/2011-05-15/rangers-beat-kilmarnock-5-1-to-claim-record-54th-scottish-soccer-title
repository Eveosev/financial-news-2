Rangers beat Kilmarnock 5-1 today in
the final round of matches in Scottish soccerâ€™s Premier League
to claim the national title for a record-extending 54th time.  Kyle Lafferty scored a hat-trick for the Gers, who take the
championship for a third straight season. Steven Naismith and
Nikica Jelavic also got goals at Rugby Park, with James Dayton
replying for the home team.  Celtic finished one point behind following a 4-0 home
victory against Motherwell today. Gary Hooper, Georgios Samaras,
Shaun Maloney and Pat McCourt got goals for the Hoops.  Rangers now have 12 more titles than archrival Celtic. The
two Glasgow clubs have claimed every league championship since
Aberdeen won in 1985.  Coach Walter Smith has led Rangers to 10 of those league
titles. The 63-year-old, in his second spell in charge, is
quitting and will be replaced by his assistant Ally McCoist for
next season.  Rangers also claimed the League Cup this campaign.  This month, Craig Whyte paid 52.5 million pounds ($85
million) for an 85 percent stake in the club previously held by
David Murray. Whyte has said he will pay off debt of about 18
million pounds to Lloyds Banking Group Plc and invest about 10
million pounds in the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
