An Ethiopian rebel group has denied
government allegations that it was responsible for the killing
of a  United Nations ’ World Food Programme worker.  Members of the Ogaden National Liberation Front attacked
WFP workers in the eastern Somali Region, Bereket Simon, the
African nation’s head of communications, said by phone today
from  Addis Ababa , the capital. A driver was killed, another
worker was injured and two are missing following a May 13
attack, the WFP said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  “It was terrorists,” Bereket said. “Remnants of the
ONLF.” The ONLF denied it was involved with the ambush and
accused the state of trying to use the killing to persuade the
U.K. government to act against it. The “cold-blooded and
cowardly” killing was carried out by Ethiopian security forces,
it said in an e-mailed statement today.  The ONLF has been fighting for self-determination for the
people of the Ogaden, a region that borders Somalia since 1984.
The government and the rebels regularly accused each other of
atrocities and claim military victories. Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi ’s administration signed a cease-fire with a faction of
the group in October and released 402 rebels from prison in
January.  All the workers attacked were Ethiopians, Judith Schuler,
WFP’s spokesman in the Horn of Africa nation said by phone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
