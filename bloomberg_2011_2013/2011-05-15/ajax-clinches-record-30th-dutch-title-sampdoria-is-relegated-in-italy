Ajax clinched a record-extending 30th
Dutch soccer league title, its first since 2004, with a 3-1 home
win over  FC Twente .  Siem de Jong scored twice yesterday as Ajax finished on 73
points, two more than Twente. It’s the first time the title has
been decided in a final-day matchup between the two contending
teams. Ajax lost 3-2 to Twente in the Dutch Cup final on May 8.  Ajax’s first title in seven years means the Amsterdam-based
club will play in the group stages of  Europe ’s elite Champions
League next season. The team will also be able to wear three
gold stars on its shirt as a 30-time national champion.  “Everyone in Amsterdam has been longing for that third
star, and now we finally have it,” Ajax coach Frank de Boer
said in comments on  UEFA ’s website. “A few weeks ago, no one
considered us still in the title race, but we’ve won it, which
makes me proud.”  PSV Eindhoven finished third after it was held to a 0-0
draw at FC Groningen, giving Twente the second spot and the
possibility of qualifying for the Champions League.  Sampdoria was relegated from Italy’s Serie A, along with
Brescia and Bari, after a 2-1 home loss to Palermo. AC Milan has
already clinched its first league title since 2004. There’s one
round of games left.  In  France , Lille stayed on course for a possible league and
cup double after beating defending champion Paris Saint-Germain
in the French Cup final two days ago. Ludovic Obraniak got the
only goal with a late free kick.  Defending league champion Marseille last night missed the
chance to narrow the gap on Lille at the top of the standings to
one point by drawing 2-2 at Lorient.  Ronaldo Ties Record  In  Spain ,  Cristiano Ronaldo  tied the record of 38 goals in
a La Liga season by scoring twice in Real  Madrid ’s 3-1 win at
Villarreal last night. The Portuguese forward’s tally matches
the mark shared by  Athletic Bilbao ’s Telmo Zarra and Real’s Hugo Sanchez. Ronaldo has one game remaining to set a record.  Barcelona, already assured of a third straight league
title, rested players including FIFA World Player of the Year
Lionel Messi in a 0-0 draw against Deportivo La Coruna last
night.  In  Germany ’s last round of league games, Wolfsburg won 3-1
at Hoffenheim two days ago to keep its top-division status, two
years after winning the title. Eintracht Frankfurt and St. Pauli
are demoted and Borussia Moenchengladbach enters a relegation
playoff.  Borussia Dortmund  had already clinched the championship,
with Bayer Leverkusen second and Bayern Munich third.  Rangers beat Kilmarnock 5-1 yesterday in the final round of
matches in the Scottish Premier League to claim the national
title for a record-extending 54th time. Kyle Lafferty scored a
hat-trick.  WEEKEND RESULTS
