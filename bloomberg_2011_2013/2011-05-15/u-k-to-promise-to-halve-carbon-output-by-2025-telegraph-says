The U.K. is set to promise to cut
 carbon emissions  in half by 2025 in what the Sunday Telegraph
said was the most ambitious carbon-cutting program in the world,
the newspaper  reported , without saying where it got the
information.  Britain, already committed to cutting emissions by 34
percent before 2020, will now be tied to a new, legally binding,
“carbon budget” for 2022 to 2027 after Prime Minister  David Cameron  was persuaded to accept the accelerated protocol, the
Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
