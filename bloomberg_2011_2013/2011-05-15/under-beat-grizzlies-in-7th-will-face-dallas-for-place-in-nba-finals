The  Oklahoma  City Thunder advanced to
the Western Conference finals with a 105-90 victory over the
 Memphis Grizzlies  in Game 7 of their National Basketball
Association playoff series.  Kevin Durant  scored 39 points as Oklahoma City pulled away
in the second half to win the best-of-seven second-round matchup
four games to three. It was the first series of the 2011 NBA
postseason to go a full seven games.  “I just wanted to be aggressive,” Durant said in a
televised interview. “My teammates kept pushing, kept giving me
the ball and I was able to get some good shots.”  Oklahoma, which relocated from Seattle in 2008, plays the
 Dallas Mavericks  for a spot in the NBA Finals. It’s the
franchise’s first trip to the conference finals since 1996.  The Thunder took a 42-34 halftime lead at  Oklahoma City 
Arena, with Durant tallying 18 points to lead all scorers. He
rebounded from an 11-point effort in Game 6, when Memphis won
95-83.  Durant also sparked Oklahoma City’s 14-2 scoring run late
in the third quarter, contributing nine points as the fourth-
seeded Thunder extended a three-point advantage to 66-51. The
NBA’s leading scorer, Durant made 13 of 25 shots, while Russell Westbrook had 14 points, 14 assists and 10 rebounds.  Mike Conley scored 18 points and Zach Randolph had 17
points and 10 rebounds for Memphis, which was seeking to become
the first No. 8 seed to reach the Western Conference finals. The
Grizzlies’ seven playoff wins set a record for an eighth-seeded
team in the West, bettering the six victories of the 1993-94
 Denver Nuggets .  The Western Conference finals start May 17 in Dallas. The
third-seeded Mavericks have been off since May 8, when they
completed a four-game sweep of the two-time defending champion
Los Angeles Lakers.  The Chicago Bulls host the Miami Heat tonight in Game 1 of
the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
