Manchester United  Chief Executive
Officer David Gill said he wouldn’t be surprised if veteran
midfielder  Paul Scholes  quits at the end of this season.  Scholes, 36, came on as a substitute yesterday as United
clinched a record 19th English league title with a 1-1 draw at
Blackburn. It was a 10th championship for Scholes, whose
contract expires at the end of next month.  “It wouldn’t surprise us if Paul Scholes retired,” Gill
told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek program. “On the other hand,
we are enjoying the success we are having, so at the end of the
season, he will have a conversation with Sir Alex (Ferguson)
about that. I am sure he will let us know his decision and we
will respect it.”  United coach Ferguson, whose team plays Barcelona in the
Champions League final at Wembley on May 28, has already seen
Gary Neville, 36, retire this season although  Ryan Giggs , 37, is
staying on a further year.  Former England midfielder Scholes has made 674 appearances
for United, scoring 150 goals.  His haul of league title “shows what he has achieved for
us and what an absolutely fantastic player he has been,” Gill
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
