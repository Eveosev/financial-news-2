Burkina Faso soldiers at a training
center for presidential guards near the border with  Ghana  fired
shots in the air yesterday after complaining they had not been
paid, a resident said.  “They began shooting at about 7 p.m.,” Rodrique Nacoulma,
a resident in Po, about 140 kilometers south of the capital,
Ouagadougou, said by phone today. The shooting continued for
about 8 hours, he said. The soldiers said they didn’t receive
their monthly pay, according to Nacoulma.  Soldiers in the West African nation,  Africa ’s biggest
copper producer, mutinied last month, forcing President Blaise Compaore, who has ruled the country since seizing power in a
coup in 1987, to dissolve the government and fire the head of
his presidential guard, and the chiefs of the army, air force
and police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
