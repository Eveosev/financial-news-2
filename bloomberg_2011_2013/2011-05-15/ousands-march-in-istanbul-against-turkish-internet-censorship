Thousands of Turkish demonstrators
poured into central Istanbul today to protest against the
government’s Internet censorship.  Haberturk  newspaper said 50,000 joined a protest centered
on the city’s Taksim Square, while  CNN-Turk  reported “hundreds
of thousands” taking to the streets in demonstrations across
the country.  New regulations from  Turkey ’s Internet Technologies and
Communications Authority set to come into effect on Aug. 22 will
require  Internet service providers  to offer a choice of four
filtering options: family, child, domestic or standard. Many
websites are expected to be blocked as a result of the filtering
measures,  Zaman  newspaper reported.  More than 600,000 people joined a Facebook page named
“ Internetime Dokunma !” or “Don’t Touch My Internet!” The
group’s organizers say Turkish authorities have already blocked
60,000 websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
