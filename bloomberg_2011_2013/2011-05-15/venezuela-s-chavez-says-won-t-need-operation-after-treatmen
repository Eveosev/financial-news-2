Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
he won’t need a knee operation after receiving treatment for it.  “Hopefully, it won’t be necessary to operate,” Chavez
said in comments carried by state television. Chavez said he is
using some of his free time to try playing a guitar that pop
singer Shakira sent him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
