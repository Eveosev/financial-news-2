Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ) ’s refinery near
Krotz Springs, Louisiana, has been granted an extension of an
order to evacuate by 5 p.m. local time.  Company staff will be able to remain at the refinery under
the extension provided by St. Landry Parish President Don
Menard, Alon spokesman Blake Lewis said in a telephone
interview. Lewis couldn’t say how long the exemption will last.
The refinery is operating normally, he said.  The 83,000-barrel-a-day refinery is within a zone that was
ordered evacuated by Menard today. Employees at the refinery are
assisting with the construction of a temporary levee to protect
the facility and other homes.  “The evacuation order is intended for low-lying
residents,” Lewis said. “We are focused on protecting our
assets.”  Louisiana  Governor Bobby Jindal said May 11 the 83,000-
barrel-a-day Krotz Springs refinery would be shut if the
Morganza spillway was opened to relieve flood pressure on the
Mississippi River.  The spillway was opened yesterday, slowly flooding the
Atchafalaya River basin today with torrents of murky Mississippi
River water, a move designed to spare inundating  Baton Rouge  and
 New Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
