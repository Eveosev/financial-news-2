Dallas  voters sent its mayoral race
into a runoff today as none of the candidates won the 50 percent
majority needed for outright victory to set the direction of
the ninth-largest U.S. city.  Mike Rawlings, 56, a former Pizza Hut president, led with
41 percent of the vote with 532 of 555 precincts reporting,
according to Dallas County records. David Kunkle, 60, ex chief
of police, won 32 percent of the vote, enough to win a June 18
runoff with Rawlings.  Ron Natinsky, 65, a City Council member, won 25 percent of
the votes to come third.  “I will start fund-raising tomorrow morning,” Kunkle said
in comments on WFAA television Channel 8 in Dallas.  The winner of the runoff will set the city’s course as
fiscal strains have led to spending cuts and tax increases in
each of the past two years. Another deficit looms for the coming
budget cycle, according to  Dallas Morning News  reports.  The winner will replace Dwaine Caraway, who got the job in
February when Tom Leppert resigned to run for the  U.S. Senate .
Caraway, still a City Council member, didn’t seek a full term as
mayor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
