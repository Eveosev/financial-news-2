Guy Hands’s Terra Firma Capital
Partners Ltd. has acquired 13 solar operating plans in  Italy ,
adding to his investments in the sector.  The purchase, confirmed by spokesman  Andrew Dowler , has
been made through Rete Rinnovabile, an Italian solar business
bought by Terra Firma in March. Terra Firma acquired the
operating plants from Italy’s Sorgenia Holdings SpA, including
12 in southern Italy and one in Lazio.  The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported the expansion plans
earlier today and said Terra Firm spent about 100 million euros
($142 million).  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
