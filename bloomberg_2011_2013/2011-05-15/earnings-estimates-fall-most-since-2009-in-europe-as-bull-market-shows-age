Analysts are cutting European
earnings forecasts by the most in almost two years just as
equities in the region trail U.S. shares by the widest margin
since the bull market began.  Estimates for Stoxx  Europe  600 Index profit growth dropped
by as much as 4 percentage points this year, including the
biggest three-month reduction since September 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Should analysts’ lowest projections
for 2011 prove correct, companies would earn about 24 billion
euros ($34 billion) less than expected at the start of the year,
the data show. Projections for earnings in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index have risen 4 points in 2011.  Lower forecasts are adding to investor concerns that also
include the biggest plunge in commodity prices since 2008 and
speculation that Greece will default on its loans. At 797 days,
the 75 percent advance in the Stoxx 600 has lasted 93 percent as
long as the average bull market since 1986, data from Birinyi
Associates Inc. show.  “The one bright spot could be starting to dim,” said
Wasif Latif, vice president of equity investments at USAA
Investment Management Co. in  San Antonio , which oversees $50
billion. European companies “have a black cloud above them,
which is this sovereign debt issue,” he said. “The micro
story, which was earnings and exports, was continuing to help,
but it may be starting to come a little bit under pressure.”  Electrolux, Lafarge  Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  in  Stockholm  lost 14 percent this year as the
average estimate for its 2011 earnings fell by the same amount,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. For Paris-based  Lafarge SA (LG) ,
analysts predict profit of 3.41 euros a share for 2011, down 14
percent from 3.98 euros on Jan. 1. The stock lost as much as 6.4
percent in the two weeks ending May 9 before rallying 4.4
percent last week.  At this point last year, analysts had boosted projections
for annual Stoxx 600 profit growth to 69 percent from 55
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Forecasts for
the earnings increase for the S&P 500 in 2011 rose to 17 percent
last week from 12 percent at the start of the year, data show.  Now, profit estimates are falling, the  European Central
Bank  is raising  interest rates  and bond investors are
speculating leaders will fail to prevent sovereign defaults.
Yields on two-year Greek  government bonds  reached a record high
of 26.77 percent on May 12.  Earnings Estimates  Stoxx 600 companies are expected to earn 25.07 euros a
share in 2011. While that’s up 19 percent from 2010, the
estimate has declined from 25.13 euros at the start of the year,
more than 12,000 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show. The
projection slipped to 24.63 this month from as high as 25.49 in
January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The falling estimates are a temporary adjustment and stocks
in the region are attractive, said Tristan Hanson, head of  asset
allocation  at Jersey, Channel Islands-based Ashburton Ltd.  “As long as this isn’t a major change in the earnings
trend, and I don’t see any reasons why it should be, you’ll get
a pretty good outcome,” said Hanson, who helps oversee $1.7
billion. “Plus, the market’s valuation is not expensive.”  At 11.2 times estimated earnings, the Stoxx 600 is trading
below its five-year average of 12.3 times profit, according to
Bloomberg data. While the benchmark index lost 4.2 percent in
the first half of 2010 as  Greece  got a 110 billion-euro rescue
package from the European Union and the  International Monetary
Fund , it rallied 13 percent in the last six months of the year.  Falling Estimates  Predictions for combined per-share profit on April 8 were
3.1 percent below the level of three months earlier, the biggest
contraction for any comparable period since September 2009, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Income estimates decreased every
month this year for European companies, the data show.  Speculation sovereign defaults will spur bank losses and
the rising euro will cut exports has held the rally in the Stoxx
600 over the last 26 months to 20 percentage points below the
gain in the  S&P 500 . While the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities
rose to a three-year high of 1,363.61 on April 29, the Stoxx 600
has failed to climb above its peak of 291.16 on Feb. 17.  Seven bull markets in the European gauge since 1986 have
averaged 853 days, according to Birinyi, the Westport,
Connecticut-based money manager and research firm. A bull market
is defined as gains of 20 percent from a low, while 20 percent
declines signal the start of a  bear market .  No-Man’s Land  European stocks “are in unknown territory,” said Cleve Rueckert, a strategist at Birinyi. “The bull market won’t
officially continue until it locks in a new high. We’re in no-
man’s land or in a holding pattern.”  The Stoxx 600 fell 0.3 percent last week to 280.5. Greece
had its  credit rating  cut on May 9 two levels to B from BB- by
S&P, which cited the risk of default and said Greek bondholders
risk losing half their investment. The gauge slipped 0.1 percent
at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London  today.  The euro-zone currency has gained 15 percent against the
dollar since June, making exports more expensive overseas. The
ECB raised borrowing costs last month for the first time in
almost three years from a record low, while the  Federal Reserve 
has left its key rate at a record near-zero since December 2008.  “You have a strong euro, an aggressive central bank, slow
growth and of course the government bond crisis,” said Joost van Leenders, who helps oversee $787 billion as strategist at
BNP Paribas Investment Partners in Amsterdam. “We are negative
on Europe.”  Higher Costs  Higher costs for steel, resins and base metals prompted
HSBC Holdings Plc analyst Colin Gibson in London to lower his
2011 per-share earnings forecast for Electrolux, the world’s
second-largest appliance maker, by 10 percent on May 4.  Analysts estimate the maker of dishwashers and cookers will
boost profit by about 1 percent this year, down from 18 percent
at the start of 2011, Bloomberg data show.  UBS AG cut its prediction for earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization at Lafarge for the next
five years by an average of 5 percent on May 9, citing the
euro’s gains. The world’s biggest cement maker reported a drop
in operating earnings on May 5 as rising energy costs and
violence in  Egypt  offset growth in demand elsewhere.  Andrew Gardiner and Youssef Essaegh, analysts at Barclays
Plc in London, reduced their 2011 estimates on May 3 for Geneva-
based  STMicroelectronics NV (STM)  by more than 5 percent, saying
Europe’s largest chipmaker will be hurt by a weakening dollar
and a decline at its wireless-chip joint venture.  STMicroelectronics has pared this year’s advance to 1.8
percent from as much as 23 percent in March.  For Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas
Fortis Global Markets, low valuations are not sufficient reason
to buy European equities.  “The corporate sector has been the stronghold,” said
Brussels-based Gijsels. “If earnings become less aggressive
just as liquidity conditions deteriorate, then that would be a
nasty environment for equity markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
