A group representing German
automobile makers will ask the government for as much as 4
billion euros ($5.6 billion) through 2014 to develop electric
cars,  WirtschaftsWoche  said, citing a report to be presented on
May 17.  Without subsidies Chancellor  Angela Merkel â€™s goal of having
one million electric cars on the roads by 2020 would not
succeed, WiWo quoted the National Platform for Electro-Mobility
report as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
