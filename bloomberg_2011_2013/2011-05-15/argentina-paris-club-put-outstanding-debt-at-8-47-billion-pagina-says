Argentina  and the  Paris Club  of
creditor nations agreed that the South American country’s
outstanding defaulted debt with the group is $8.47 billion,
 Pagina 12  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The amount was decided on after Argentina said it won’t pay
about $1 billion debt taken by the military dictatorship that
governed the country from 1976 to 1983, the Buenos Aires-based
newspaper said.  The timeline for the payment is still being discussed, with
Argentina seeking an arrangement for it to pay about $1.5
billion a year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
