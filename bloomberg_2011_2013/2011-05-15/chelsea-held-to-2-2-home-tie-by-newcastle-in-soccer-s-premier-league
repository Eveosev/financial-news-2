Chelsea was held to a 2-2 home draw
by Newcastle today in English soccer’s Premier League, a day
after it lost its title to  Manchester United .  Branislav Ivanovic put the Blues ahead after only two
minutes at Stamford Bridge, with Jonas Gutierrez scoring for
Newcastle on 10 minutes. Alex restored Chelsea’s advantage in
the 84th minute, before Steven Taylor made it 2-2 in injury
time.  Chelsea, on 71 points, is six behind first-place United
with one game to play. Third-place Arsenal will move within one
point of Chelsea if it wins against  Aston Villa  today.  In other games, West Ham will be relegated if it fails to
win at Wigan, or Birmingham avoids defeat against Fulham.
