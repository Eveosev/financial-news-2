The U.K. Treasury is considering
plans to sell a 5 billion pound ($8.1 billion) stake in  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , the Sunday Telegraph reported.  A sale to professional investors and sovereign wealth funds
from the Middle East and East Asia could take place as early as
the first half of 2012, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
sources. The sale, which would represent about 13 percent of the
governmentâ€™s 83 percent stake in the bank, may be the first of
four RBS stake sales, according to the report.  A decision on the divestment will be clearer by the end of
this year after the Independent Commission on Banking releases
its report on the industry, the Sunday Telegraph said.  Linda Harper, a spokeswoman for RBS in London, declined to
comment on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
