Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)  will this week announce a partnership to
sell their services, the Sunday Times reported, without citing
anyone.  Vodafone and Verizon will also cooperate on procurements to
make savings, the newspaper said. The partnership comes as the
companies plan to resume dividend payments from their jointly
owned Verizon Wireless, according to the Sunday Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
