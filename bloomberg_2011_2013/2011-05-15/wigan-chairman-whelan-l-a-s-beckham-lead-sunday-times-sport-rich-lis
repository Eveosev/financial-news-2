Dave Whelan, chairman of Wigan
Athletic soccer club, and former England captain  David Beckham 
keep their places as the two wealthiest people in the annual
Sunday Times Sport  Rich List , published today.  Whelan, a professional player before founding JJB Sports
Plc, and his family are estimated to have a fortune of 190
million pounds ($307 million), unchanged on last year. He’s
followed by Los Angeles Galaxy’s Beckham, whose wealth is put at
135 million pounds, up 8 percent.  Eight of the richest 12 have been involved in motor sport.
They include 2008 Formula One champion  Lewis Hamilton  and 2009
winner  Jenson Button , now teammates at McLaren.  The wealthiest soccer manager is England coach  Fabio Capello , on 37 million pounds, the London-based Sunday Times
said.  Alex Ferguson , whose Manchester United team has just
clinched a record 19th English title, is second on 27 million
pounds.  Carlo Ancelotti , who led Chelsea to a league and Cup
“double” last year, is third on 25 million pounds.  The Sport Rich List includes current and retired sportsmen
or women in Britain and Ireland. People playing abroad and
foreigners competing in Britain are among those eligible.
