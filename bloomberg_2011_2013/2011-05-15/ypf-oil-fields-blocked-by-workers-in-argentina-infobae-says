YPF SA (YPFD)  oil and gas fields in the
southern Argentine province of Chubut were blocked yesterday by
construction workers amid a salary dispute, news website
Infobae.com.ar  reported , without saying how it obtained the
information.  The protest is being organized by workers who work at the
fields and are demanding a 5,000 peso ($1,224) bonus, Infobae
said. YPF’s output from Chubut is 5,000 cubic meters a day, or
2.5 percent of Argentina’s total crude output, the website said.
Fields in neighboring Santa Cruz province are also blocked,
Infobae said, without citing anyone.  To contact the report on this story:
