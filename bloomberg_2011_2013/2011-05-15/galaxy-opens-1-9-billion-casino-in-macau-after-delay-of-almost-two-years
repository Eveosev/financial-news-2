Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ,
part-owned by Permira Advisers LLP, opens its HK$14.9 billion
($1.9 billion) casino resort in  Macau  today after an almost two-
year delay because of the credit crisis.  The 450-table, 2,200-room  Galaxy Macau  may help  Hong Kong 
billionaire Lui Che-woo’s company reduce its reliance on high-
stakes gamblers, said Donald Cheng, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
Haitong Securities Ltd. Galaxy’s StarWorld casino made about 90
percent of first-quarter sales from gamblers betting as much as
$250,000 a hand.  “It will help Galaxy diversify its business,” Cheng, who
recommends buying the stock, said in an interview. “Being the
only new  casino  in the city this year, when revenue is
undergoing a strong and healthy period of growth, will also
bring more people there.”  Casino  gambling revenue  in Macau will probably grow 35
percent to about $32 billion this year, according to estimates
by CLSA Asia Pacific Markets. Galaxy has almost quadrupled in
market value over the past year,  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  has more than
doubled and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  climbed 87 percent as gambling has
surged in the world’s biggest casino hub.  The new venue will be “a strong catalyst for market
growth” and will help boost revenue in the so-called mass-
market gambling segment, which is more profitable, Aaron Fischer
and Huei Suen Ng, Hong Kong-based analysts for CLSA Asia-Pacific
Markets, said in a note to clients.  Cotai Strip  Galaxy Macau is on the isthmus of reclaimed land known as
the Cotai Strip, where billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ,  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s chairman and chief executive officer, has said he
planned to recreate the  Las Vegas Strip . Sands’ Venetian Macao,
the world’s biggest casino by floor area, is on the Cotai Strip,
with  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) ’s City of Dreams across the
road from it.  Gambling revenue in the former Portuguese colony soared 58
percent last year to 188.3 billion patacas ($23.5 billion),
about four times that of the Las Vegas Strip. Galaxy’s Hong
Kong-listed shares gained 174 percent in the period and more
than tripled in 2009.  Macau’s  casino gambling revenue  grew 43 percent to 58.5
billion patacas in the three months ended March as visitors from
mainland  China  placed more bets on baccarat and other card
games.  Revenue from high-stakes or VIP gamblers was 42.6 billion
patacas, accounting for 73 percent of total first-quarter casino
gambling revenue, up from 70 percent in the same period in 2010.  City of Dreams  Galaxy shares rose 3 percent HK$13.94 on May 13. The stock
has surged 58 percent this year, compared with the 25 percent
climb for Adelson’s Sands China. Wynn Macau has gained 50
percent while billionaire  Stanley Ho ’s  SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) ,
Macau’s biggest casino operator, has advanced 45 percent.  Galaxy Macau, the biggest casino to be completed in the
city since Melco Crown’s City of Dreams in June 2009, is aimed
at middle-class Chinese gamblers and may boost the company’s
revenue at least 20 percent this year, Francis Lui, son of Lui
Che-woo and the company’s deputy chairman, said in March.  “Given a strong execution of Galaxy Macau, we expect a
strong turnaround of the company’s financial over the next 12 to
18 months,” UBS analysts Grant Chum and Gary Ngan wrote in an
April 20 report. The analysts expect earnings per share to
double to HK$1.03 in 2012 from 2011.  Galaxy Macau was originally scheduled to open in the third
quarter of 2009. The casino operator announced in November 2008
that it would delay the project.  Earnings Forecast  Galaxy may post record earnings in the first half on
increased revenue from high-stake gamblers, Chief Financial
Officer Robert Drake said in an April 20 interview, after the
company reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization jumped 71 percent to a record HK$712 million in
the first quarter.  Galaxy reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of HK$990 million in the first six
months of 2010 on sales of HK$8.6 billion.  Sands China,  Asia ’s biggest casino company by market value,
said this month first-quarter profit more than doubled as
visitors to Macau increased.  Wynn, a unit of the casino operator founded by billionaire
Steven Wynn, last month said first-quarter profit surged 66
percent after opening its second casino in the Macau in April
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
