Eurocash SA (EUR) , Polandâ€™s largest
distributor of non-durable consumer goods, said first-quarter
net income fell 35 percent from a year earlier as costs
increased.  Net income declined to 8.78 million zloty ($3.15 million)
in the January to March period from 13.48 million zloty in the
same period of 2010, the company said in a regulatory filing
yesterday. That compares with the 11.6 million-zloty mean
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
