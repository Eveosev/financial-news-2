Brazil ’s central bank President
Alexandre Tombini has reacted “at a slower pace” to the
deterioration of inflation than his predecessor  Henrique Meirelles ,  O Estado de S. Paulo  reported, citing an interview
with former central bank director Sergio Werlang.  Now an executive director at Banco Itau Holding Financeira
SA, Werlang told Estado the change in attitude is “healthy” as
Tombini’s team is committed to fighting inflation and that’s
what matters to the market.  Brazil’s annual inflation rate rose to 6.51 percent in the
year through April, the first time the benchmark IPCA index
exceeded the 6.5 percent upper limit of the central bank’s
target range since 2005. The central bank targets inflation of
4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
