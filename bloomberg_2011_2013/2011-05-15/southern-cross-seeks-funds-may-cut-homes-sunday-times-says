Southern Cross  Healthcare Plc may
sell or close some of its care homes and give its landlords a
share in the business in return for rent cuts, the Sunday Times
reported, without citing anyone.  Southern Cross, which looks after 31,000 elderly people,
also hired Greenhill & Co., Inc. investment bank to help raise
as much as 100 million pounds ($162 million) from investors to
pay debt, the newspaper said. The company, which operates 750
care homes, may quit between 100 and 200 homes, most of which
would be taken over by another operator, according to the
newspaper. It may also “walk away from” as many as 50 others,
the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
