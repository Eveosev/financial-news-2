Saudi Arabia ’s economy will expand
5.3 percent this year, powered by higher oil prices and more
 government spending  in the Arab world’s largest economy,
 National Commercial Bank  said.  The economy will grow 4.2 percent in 2012, the  Jeddah ,
Saudi Arabia-based bank said in an e-mailed report today. The
kingdom will “benefit from the recent positive oil price
shock” as it raises output 6.2 percent to average 8.8 million
barrels a day this year, compared with last, the bank said.  The kingdom, which depends on oil for 86 percent of its
revenue, announced increases in government spending in March as
protests calling for more job opportunities and democracy
engulfed the Middle East. The package included $67 billion on
housing and funds for the military and religious groups that
backed the government’s ban on domestic protests, and followed a
$36 billion handout announced on Feb. 23.  “The series of royal decrees announced in the first
quarter 2011 will provide favorable stimulus to the non-oil
sector, estimated to grow at 5 percent,”  National Commercial
Bank  said. The construction and retail sectors will be “the key
beneficiaries” of the new spending, it said.  The Saudi central bank Governor Muhammad al-Jasser said on
March 24 that the kingdom’s economic growth will exceed 4
percent this year. That compares with growth of 3.8 percent in
2010.  Budget Surplus   With higher oil prices, Saudi Arabia will record a budget
surplus of 62.8 billion riyals ($16.8 billion), National
Commercial said. Oil revenue this year is expected at 828.2
billion riyals, it said.  Saudi Arabia predicted on Dec. 20 that its 2011 budget will
have a deficit of 40 billion riyals. At the time, total spending
was forecast at 580 billion riyals, according to the Riyadh-
based  Finance Ministry .  The break-even oil price required to balance the budget
this year will increase to $84 a barrels this year from $65 a
barrel last year, the bank said. Oil prices have increased 8.8
percent this year. Crude oil for June delivery gained 68 cents
to $99.65 a barrel on May 13 on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  To contact the reporters on this story:
