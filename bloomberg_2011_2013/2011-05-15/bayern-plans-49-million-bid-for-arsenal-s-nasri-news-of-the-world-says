Arsenal’s France midfielder Samir Nasri is a 30 million-pound ($48.6 million) target for  Bayern
Munich , the News of the World reported, without citing anyone.  Nasri, who joined Arsenal in July 2008, has only one year
remaining on his contract and is yet to hold talks on extending
his stay at the Premier League soccer club, the newspaper said.  Bayern wants the 23-year-old to replace countryman Franck Ribery as it rebuilds following a campaign in which it finished
third in the Bundesliga, 10 points behind champion Borussia
Dortmund, the News of the World said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
