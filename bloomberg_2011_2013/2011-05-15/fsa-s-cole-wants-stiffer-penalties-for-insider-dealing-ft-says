U.K. Financial Services Authority
Business Conduct Unit’s Interim Head,  Margaret Cole  asked the
government to increase the maximum sentence for dealing from 7
years to 10 years, the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview. “A longer sentence is important because a lot of
enforcement work is about sending messages that this is
serious,” Cole said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
