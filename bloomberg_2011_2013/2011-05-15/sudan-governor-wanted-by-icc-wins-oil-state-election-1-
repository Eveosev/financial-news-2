Ahmed Haroun, the incumbent governor
of northern  Sudan ’s only oil-producing state, wanted by the
 International Criminal Court  for  war crimes  in the western
region of Darfur, was declared the winner of Southern Kordofan
state’s delayed elections.  “Ahmed Haroun was the winner in the election,” Abdallah
Ahmed Abdallah, deputy head of Sudan’s  National Elections
Commission , told reporters today in the Sudanese capital
Khartoum.  Southern Kordofan, which includes the Nuba Mountains, was
the scene of heavy fighting during the two-decade civil war
between the northern and southern regions that ended with a
 peace agreement  in 2005. The state is located on the border
between the two regions.  A local branch of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement,
 Southern Sudan ’s ruling party which led the rebellion against
the Sudanese government in Khartoum, said yesterday it will not
recognize the results of the elections because of alleged vote
rigging.  The National Elections Commission added a polling center in
the state without alerting the SPLM, whose monitoring agents
were not present as a result, Yasser Arman, the secretary-
general of the SPLM’s northern sector told reporters yesterday
in Khartoum.  The  Carter Center , which monitored the three-day vote which
started on May 2, called on the political parties to remain calm
during the aggregation process in an e-mailed statement on May
9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
