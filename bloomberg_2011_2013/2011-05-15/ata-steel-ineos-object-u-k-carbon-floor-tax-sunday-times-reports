Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , Ineos Group Holdings
Plc and  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  said the U.K. government plans to impose a
“carbon floor” tax will make them uncompetitive, the Sunday
Times reported, citing unidentified person familiar with the
matter and a letter by Ineos owner Jim Ratcliffe.  The planned tax on emissions on top of levies imposed by
the European Union will make Ineos’s chlorine plant in Runcorn,
Chesire, uneconomically and force the company to shut it and
move production to Germany and Norway, the newspaper said,
citing the letter.  Tata Steel also made its case “at the highest levels of
government,” the Sunday Times reported, citing the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
