Alliance Trust Plc (ATST)  Chief Executive
Officer Katherine Garrett-Cox will set out a policy on share
buybacks at an annual meeting on May 20, the Observer reported,
without citing anyone.  Hedge fund Laxey Partners, which owns less than 2 percent
of Alliance Trust, is seeking a policy whereby the Scottish
company would buy back shares whenever its price falls to a 10
percent discount on net asset value, according to the newspaper.
Laxey founder Colin Kingsnorth is “unhappy” with Garrett-Cox’s
pay, which has totaled 2.45 million pounds ($3.97 million) since
2008, the Observer said, citing the investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
