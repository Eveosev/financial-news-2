A Brazilian investment fund worth $24
million has attracted wealthy investors as the value of auctions
of the country’s art grows by as much as 38 percent a year.  The fund is the latest from the emerging BRIC markets of
 Brazil ,  Russia ,  India  and  China  to appeal to collectors. Brazil
Golden Art: BGA Private Equity Investment Fund is part of the
Rio de Janeiro- and Sao Paulo-based firm Plural Capital, which
is putting money into  Latin America ’s largest economy.  “While most of the modern and contemporary art markets
around the world were hit hard by the 2008-2009 economic crisis,
the Brazilian auction market recorded a 38 percent increase from
2008 to 2009,” the London-based research company  ArtTactic  said
in its latest report about the country.  About 40 art funds were launched in the U.S. and  Europe 
during the boom of 2005 to 2007, according to  Skate’s Art Market
Research . Since the financial crisis, the London-based  Fine Art
Fund , started in 2004, is the only one of these vehicles that
has remained conspicuously active in the West. It currently has
about $100 million under management after originally planning to
raise as much as $350 million.  “There’s a deep group of Brazilian collectors and there’s
been less speculation in that particular market,”  Philip Hoffman , chief executive of the Fine Art Fund, said in an
interview. “We do have investors interested in Brazil.”  The  BGA fund  is worth 40 million reais and will buy
contemporary works, mainly from Brazil. Initial external
investment for the new fund was 10 million reais short of the
target capitalization, Bruno Miguel, an analyst at Plural
Capital, said in an interview.  Investing Options  “The fund will spend three years investing, then two years
uninvesting,” Miguel said. “We may sell the whole collection
to a museum or gallery. We’ll see what the best option is at the
time.”  Phillips de Pury & Co. found buyers for eight out of the 10
Brazilian works offered in the evening session of its last two-
day BRIC auction in  London  last month.  The 1989  Beatriz Milhazes  wallpaper-like abstract, “I just
wanted to understand why he did that,” led the Latin American
contingent at 361,000 pounds ($585,000). The presale estimate
was 250,000 pounds to 350,000 pounds.  Investors hope for the sort of price rises seen for the
constructivist sculptress Lygia Clark in the last 12 months. In
April 2010, at Phillips’s inaugural BRIC sale, a 1960 aluminum
“Bicho” sculpture by Clark sold for a record 367,250 pounds,
more than five times the previous auction high for the artist.  Paris Fair  Two further 1960s “Bicho” pieces sold for about 700,000
euros ($987,000) each at the FIAC art fair in Paris in October.  Neither BGA nor Phillips, when contacted, would comment on
whether the fund had been bidding at the last London BRIC sale.  A 1970 white painted wood “Relief” by the constructivist
sculptor  Sergio Camargo  was another Brazilian success, selling
for 229,250 pounds against a high estimate of 120,000 pounds.  In February, Christie’s International achieved an artist
record 1.1 million pounds for the 2001 work, “Parede com
Incisoes a la Fontana II (Wall with Incisions a la Fontana
II),” by the Brazilian contemporary artist  Adriana Varejao 
(born 1964). Reminiscent of a  Lucio Fontana  slash painting, with
bleeding incisions, it had been estimated at 200,000 pounds to
300,000 pounds and was the first work by a Brazilian
contemporary artist to fetch a hammer price above 1 million
pounds at auction, ArtTactic said.  “Despite the overall strong performance in the Brazilian
contemporary art market, the sector remains narrow, with only
four or five artists driving the market and the prices,”
ArtTactic said. “We believe the recent auction performance by
Varejao and Milhazes will increase confidence among consignors
and buyers, and we are likely to see a broader range of
Brazilian artists coming to the auction market.”  The 7th edition of Brazil’s biggest contemporary art fair,
 SP-Arte , ended yesterday in an Oscar Niemeyer-designed building
in  Sao Paulo . The event featured a record 89 dealers, more than
70 of them based in Brazil.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
