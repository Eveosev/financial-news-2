Japan ’s bonds fell, reversing gains
and pushing 10-year yields up from a near six-month low, as a
technical indicator signaled the rally in debt was overdone and
government data showed an unexpected rise in machinery orders.  Bond futures dropped for the first time in five days after
their 14-day relative strength index climbed to 73 on May 13,
exceeding the 70 level that some traders see as a sign that an
asset’s price is poised to fall. Factory orders rose 2.9 percent
month-on-month in March, when Japan was struck by the country’s
biggest earthquake on record.  “People have been wary about the high level of bond
prices,” said  Akitsugu Bandou , a senior economist in  Tokyo  at
Okasan Securities Co., one of the 24 primary dealers obliged to
bid at government debt sales. “Consensus among investors is
that the economy will pick up once rebuilding boosts demand for
goods and services.”  The benchmark 10-year yield added two basis points to 1.135
percent as of 4:02 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s
largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.1 percent security due
March 2021 fell 0.177 yen to 99.690 yen. The yield earlier sank
to 1.105 percent, the lowest since Nov. 24.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery slid 0.12 to 140.70
at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  “Traders closed their positions on futures by selling
them,” said Okasan’s Bandou. “Profit taking prevailed.”  Economists had estimated a 10 percent drop in Japan’s
machinery orders, an indicator of  capital spending  in three to
six months.  40-Year Auction  The Ministry of Finance will sell 400 billion yen ($4.94
billion) in 40-year debt tomorrow. The prior sale of 40-year
bonds on Feb. 8 drew bids valued at 2.06 times the amount on
offer, compared with the average of 3.34 for the past 10
auctions.  Bonds gained earlier as Japanese shares fell before U.S.
data forecast to show the housing market and manufacturing in
the world’s biggest economy are struggling to recover.  “Looking around globally, we can see lots of negative
factors for the economy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps
oversee about $18 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “As a result, bonds get  bought.”  The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
sentiment index was 17 this month from 16 in April, according to
a Bloomberg News survey before the figures today. Numbers lower
than 50 signal more respondents view conditions as poor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
