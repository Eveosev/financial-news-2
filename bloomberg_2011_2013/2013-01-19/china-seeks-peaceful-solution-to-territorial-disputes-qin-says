Territorial disputes should be
settled peacefully through bilateral dialogue and discussion,
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said.  Qin’s comments, posted on the ministry’s website today,
were in response to a question from an unidentified journalist
about China’s view on comments made in Jakarta yesterday by
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe regarding Japan’s relations
with the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations.  “We hope that Japan will follow the historical trend, take
responsibility and make efforts toward stability and development
in Asia,” Qin said.  At a press conference in Jakarta with Indonesia’s President
 Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , Abe said “the seas are a common
resource protected by the rule of law, not power, and Japan
along with ASEAN countries, will protect this with all our
strength.”  China is involved in a territorial dispute with Japan over
islands in the  East China Sea  known as Diaoyu in Chinese and
Senkaku in Japanese. China also has disputes with Vietnam and
the Philippines, which are members of ASEAN.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
