Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) , the Saudi Arabian
company that operates a joint venture with  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , said
fourth-quarter profit rose 29 percent as revenue grew.  Net income increased to 369 million riyals ($98.4 million)
from 285.5 million riyals a year earlier, the company said in a
 statement  on the Saudi stock exchange website today. That was
more than the 331 million-riyal average estimate of nine
analysts compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Almarai recorded a strong performance in the bakery and
poultry, as well as the consolidation of International Dairy &
Juice Ltd.  “We believe Almarai has a solid long-term growth outlook,
with poultry and bakery expected to play an increasingly
important role,” NCB Capital said today. “We believe margins
have bottomed out, and thus continued evidence of this will act
as a key catalyst for the stock price.”  Almarai gained 1.9 percent to 66.3 riyals. The shares have
risen 4.3 percent this year.  Fourth-quarter operating profit increased 27 percent to
437.3 million riyals, the company said. It recommended a
dividend of 1.25 riyals per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
