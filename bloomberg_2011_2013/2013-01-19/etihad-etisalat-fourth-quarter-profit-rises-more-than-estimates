Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the Saudi
telecommunications operator known as Mobily, reported an 11
percent increase in fourth-quarter profit because of more
revenue from subscriber roaming charges and data services.  Net income rose to 1.9 billion riyals ($507 million) from
1.7 billion riyals in the same period a year earlier, the
company said in a  statement  on the Saudi stock exchange’s
website today. That was more than the 1.75 billion-riyal average
estimate from 13 analysts compiled by  Bloomberg News .  Mobily and other Saudi telecommunications companies
benefitted from economic growth of 6.8 percent last year in the
Gulf Cooperation Council’s most-populous country. They also
gained from religious pilgrims heading to the country and using
their mobile phones from outside  Saudi Arabia .  The fourth-quarter gain is “attributable to the rise in
data revenues,” the company said in the statement. “The number
of visitors roaming on the company’s network increased by 24
percent during the Hajj season.”  Mobily shares gained 1.4 percent to 72 riyals at 1:14 p.m.
in Riyadh. The shares have advanced 4.2 percent this year.  Saudi Arabia, with a population of  28 million people , had
53.1 million mobile-phone subscriptions and 4.74 million for
fixed lines at the end of the third quarter this year, according
to the Communications and Information Technology Commission.  Revenue increased 17 percent to 6.8 billion riyals from 5.8
billion riyals in the fourth quarter a year before, Mobily said.
That growth is due to a 41 percent rise in data revenue, while
sales from the fiber optic and 4G networks advanced more than 70
percent on the previous year, it said.  Mobily plans to spend more than 22 billion riyals during
the next five years on its mobile broadband sector and to expand
its fiber optic network to 500,000 residential units by the end
of 2013, Chairman Abdulaziz Al Sagheer said in the statement.  Fourth-quarter operating profit increased 8 percent to 1.9
billion riyals, the company said. It recommended a dividend of
1.15 riyals per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
