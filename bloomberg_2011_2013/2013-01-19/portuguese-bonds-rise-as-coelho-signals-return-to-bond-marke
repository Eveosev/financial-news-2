Portuguese 10-year bonds rose for a
third week after Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  signaled the
nation plans to return to the  debt market  as it does not want a
second rescue program.  German bunds advanced as European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said in Paris yesterday he doesn’t
expect repayments on ECB loans by banks to affect a key money
market rate. Spanish securities slid after a report showed euro-
area industrial production fell in November more than economists
forecast.  “The market is taking the news on  Portugal  planning to
return to the market positively,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“It’s not that Portugal has solved its problems overnight. It’s
just that there is a huge appetite for high-yielding assets and
there’s ample liquidity in the market, which the country may be
able to take advantage of.”  The yield on 10-year Portuguese bonds dropped nine basis
points, or 0.09 percentage point, from last week to 6.12 percent
at 5 p.m.  London  time. The 4.95 percent security maturing in
October 2023 rose 0.625, or 6.25 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,331)
face amount, to 90.925.  Also in Paris yesterday, Coelho said his government will
soon announce the measures that are “necessary to materialize”
the return to the market. Portugal’s net borrowing needs will be
about 11.5 billion euros in 2013, the debt management agency
said on Jan. 11. The country hasn’t auctioned bonds since
requesting a bailout in April 2011.  Repaying Loans  Banks are able to begin repaying loans taken from the ECB’s
Longer-Term Refinancing Operation from the end of this month.
The Frankfurt-based ECB lent financial institutions about 1
trillion euros for as much as three years via two LTROs in
December 2011 and February last year. Banks in so-called core
countries including  Germany  are likely to be the first to repay
the ECB loans, according to Soniya Sadeesh, a strategist at
Deutsche Bank AG in London, wrote in a Jan. 17 note.  Spanish and Italian bonds fell for the first week in three.
 Spain ’s 10-year rates rose 19 basis points to 5.08 percent and
those on similar-maturity Italian securities climbed four basis
points to 4.17 percent.  Output in the euro area dropped 0.3 percent from October,
when it declined a revised 1 percent, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said Jan. 14. Economists had
forecast an increase of 0.2 percent, according to the median of
37 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  Services, Manufacturing  Euribor futures dropped, indicating traders expect
interbank borrowing rates to increase. The implied yield on the
December 2013 contract climbed seven basis points this week to
0.435 percent, and rose to 0.54 percent yesterday, the highest
since July 10.  An index of euro-area services and manufacturing output
contracted for a 12th month in January, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed before the report by  Markit
Economics  on Jan. 24.  German bonds lost 1.5 percent this month through Jan. 17,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s gained 1.4
percent and  Italy ’s advanced 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
