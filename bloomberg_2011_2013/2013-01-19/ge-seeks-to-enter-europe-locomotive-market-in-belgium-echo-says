General Electric Co. seeks to enter
the European locomotive market via Belgium with a new product,
the Euroloco, L’Echo reported, citing GE Transportation Chief
Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli.  “Two things go together for us: to demonstrate this
product in Belgium and to enter the European market,” Simonelli
told the Belgian newspaper in an interview published today.
“That’s our new strategy.”  Belgium is ideally situated for “conquering European
freight,” Simonelli told L’Echo, adding that the company eyes
“double-digit growth in Europe.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
