The yen weakened beyond 90 to the
dollar for the first time in 31 months amid speculation the
currency will slide further as the  Bank of Japan (8301)  and the
government work aggressively to spur economic growth.  The euro gained versus the majority of its most-traded
peers as  Spain ’s borrowing costs fell at a 4.5 billion-euro ($6
billion) sale of bonds, underscoring increased confidence in
European debt markets. The Swiss franc dropped. The Japanese
currency continued its longest stretch of weekly losses since
1989 amid bets the BOJ will decide to conduct open-ended asset
buying to stoke inflation. The central bank meets Jan. 21-22.  “The open-ended thing is a little bit of a new twist to
the policy easing we’re expecting from Japan, and it’s started
to gain traction,”  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in
 Washington  at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency
brokerage, said in a telephone interview. “That’s what I’m
attributing the latest leg lower in the yen to. The market is
starting to fine-tune its expectations as to what we’ll see from
policy makers over there.”  The yen declined 0.2 percent to 90.10 per dollar this week
in New York and touched 90.21 yesterday, the weakest level since
June 23, 2010. It was the 10th consecutive weekly loss. The
Japanese currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 119.98 per euro and
reached 120.71, its weakest since May 4, 2011.  The euro slipped 0.2 percent to $1.3321. It climbed to
$1.3404 on Jan. 14, the highest since Feb. 29, 2012.  Franc Weakens  Switzerland ’s currency tumbled against all of its 16 major
peers as signs  Europe ’s debt crisis is easing sapped demand for
haven assets. The franc depreciated to 1.2569 per euro
yesterday, the weakest since the  Swiss National Bank  imposed an
exchange-rate cap in September 2011, and lost 2.1 percent on the
week to 1.2445.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said Jan. 10
there were “strong capital inflows” into the region. Yields on
Spanish and Italian sovereign debt have declined, with Spain’s
10-year yield falling to 5.08 percent, from as much in December
as 5.56, and  Italy ’s dropping to 4.17 percent, from 4.82.  “The crisis is being priced out more and more, which means
that the Swiss franc is less in demand,” Antje Praefcke, a
senior currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said
in a Jan. 17 interview. “It should remain under pressure, and I
think the SNB is probably pleased to see that.”  Currency Bets  Futures traders trimmed for a fifth straight week their
bets that the yen will decline against the  U.S. dollar , figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
show. The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 65,727 on Jan.
15, versus net shorts of 74,096 a week earlier.  Speculators  reversed  their euro bets for a third week,
wagering the shared currency will rise against the U.S. dollar.
Net longs totaled 7,315 on Jan. 15, versus net shorts of 8,035 a
week earlier and net longs of 5,126 the week before that.  The euro gained 1.9 percent over the past year versus nine
developed-nation peers tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The Norwegian krone was the best performer, climbing
5.2 percent, while the dollar fell 2 percent. The yen was the
biggest loser, tumbling 18 percent.  Japan ’s currency lost 6.5 percent against the dollar over
the past month after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s  Liberal
Democratic Party  swept to power. Abe, who’s campaigning to boost
the economy, has called for “bold monetary policy” to defeat
deflation and drive the yen lower. He’s pressing the BOJ to
double its 1 percent inflation target.  Asset-Buying  At its meeting last month, the central bank expanded its
asset-buying program for the third time in four months,
increasing its purchase fund to 76 trillion yen ($844 billion).  A gauge of currency  volatility  rose to a five-month high
this week, increasing chances that price swings will wipe out
profits. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G7  Volatility Index , based on
three-month options on Group of Seven nations’ currencies,
increased to 9.19 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 2.  Sterling was the third-biggest loser among major currencies
this week, dropping the most against the dollar since June. The
pound fell 1.6 percent to $1.5870. Norway’s krone also slid
versus the greenback, depreciating 1.3 percent to 5.6001.  The South African rand sank yesterday to its lowest level
since Dec. 3, dropping for a third straight week amid concern
labor protests in mining and agriculture will curb exports and
slow growth in  Africa ’s largest economy.  Anglo American Plc’s platinum unit, the world’s largest
miner of the metal, said Jan. 15 it may fire as many as 14,000
workers as it idles four shafts. Production cutbacks may curb
South Africa’s exports, preventing the rand from gaining even as
commodity prices rise, said Mohammed Nalla, head of strategic
research at Nedbank Group Ltd.  The currency fell 1.8 percent this week to 8.8805 per
dollar and touched 8.9181. It was the week’s worst performance
after that of the franc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
