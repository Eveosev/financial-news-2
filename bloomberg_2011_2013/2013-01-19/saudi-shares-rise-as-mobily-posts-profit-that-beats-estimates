Saudi Arabian shares rose for a
second trading day, led by  Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC)  after the
telecommunications company reported fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates.  The company, known as Mobily, gained 1.4 percent to 72
riyals. Alinma Bank increased 2.2 percent to 13.8 riyals and
 Almarai Co. (ALMARAI) , the biggest food producer in the Persian Gulf,
climbed 1.9 percent to 66.25 riyals. The Tadawul All Share Index
was up 0.2 percent to 7050.38 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.
The Arab world’s biggest stock exchange has gained 3.7 percent
this year.  “The outstanding results of Mobily’s fourth-quarter
earnings played a major role in driving the index to reverse the
trend from red to green,” said Mohammed Al-Omran, a financial
analyst and president of the Gulf Center for Financial
Consultancy in  Riyadh .  Etihad Etisalat today reported an 11 percent increase in
profit because of higher revenue from subscriber roaming charges
and data services.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian gulf
bourse operating Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
