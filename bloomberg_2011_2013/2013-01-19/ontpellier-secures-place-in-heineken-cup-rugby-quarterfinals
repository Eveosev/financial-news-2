Montpellier beat Toulon 23-3 to
qualify for the quarterfinals of rugby’s Heineken Cup, while 
defending champion Leinster stayed in the hunt for a spot 
in the next round.   Montpellier joins Harlequins, Ulster, Clermont Auvergne and
Toulon in reaching the final eight of  Europe ’s top club
competition. The six pool winners plus the two best second-place
teams advance, with the final three places determined by
tomorrow’s final round of games.  Montpellier’s win over Pool 6 winner Toulon guarantees it
finishes as a second-place qualifier. Leinster, second in Pool
5, beat Exeter 29-20, while first-place Clermont routed the
Scarlets 29-0. Glasgow beat Northampton 27-20 to eliminate the
Saints in Pool 4, and Ulster beat Castres 9-8 to finish first.  Tomorrow, Pool 1 leader Saracens host Edinburgh and second-
place Munster plays Racing Metro, while Toulouse and Leinster,
the top two teams in Pool 2, meet.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
