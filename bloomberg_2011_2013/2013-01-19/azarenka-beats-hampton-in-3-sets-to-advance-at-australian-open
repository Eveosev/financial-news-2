Defending champion  Victoria Azarenka 
was pushed to three sets by an injured opponent before reaching
the fourth round of the Australian Open along with  Serena Williams ,  Roger Federer  and  Andy Murray . No. 6 Juan Martin Del Potro became the highest seed to be eliminated.  With the third round complete, Del Potro is the only one of
the top eight men’s seeds who failed to make it to the last 16
at the season-opening Grand Slam tournament. Six of the eight
leading women advanced to the second week.  Top-seeded Azarenka of Belarus, who won her first major
title at Melbourne Park 12 months ago, came back from a break
down in the third set to beat 63rd-ranked Jamie Hampton of the
U.S. 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 yesterday at Rod Laver Arena.  “These kind of matches sometimes bring better things for
you in the future,” Azarenka, who was outhit by  41 winners to
17 , told reporters. “Because winning ugly always means that you
overcome something, that you weren’t feeling great, you weren’t
feeling all your shots. From here, I can only go up.”  Hampton, who took a medical timeout before holding her
serve to win the second set and appeared to wince from pain when
striking the ball for the rest of the match, broke for a 2-1
lead in the deciding set before Azarenka won the next five
games. Hampton said afterward that she has two herniated disks
that require her back to be taped up before each match.  Azarenka, 23, will play Elena Vesnina tomorrow for a
place in the quarterfinals after the world No. 47 from Russia
outlasted No. 16 seed Roberta Vinci of Italy 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4
in a two hour, 53-minute contest.  Djokovic, Sharapova  Today, men’s No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  continues
his bid for a third straight Australian Open title against
Switzerland’s  Stanislas Wawrinka , the 15th seed. Women’s No. 2
 Maria Sharapova  of Russia faces Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium.  Williams, the No. 3 seed from the U.S., fell behind 0-3 in
the second set yesterday before completing a 6-1, 6-3 victory
over Ayumi Morita of Japan to extend her winning run to 19
matches. She said the ankle she rolled during her opening match
was improving every day and she’s able to practice hard.  “I feel today was actually a really good match for me,”
said Williams, who fired a 207 kilometer-per-hour (129 mile-per-
hour) ace to match her mark for the fastest serve of the women’s
draw. “I was involved in a lot of longer points, something I
definitely wanted.”  The 31-year-old Williams, who lifted her tally of major
titles to 15 by winning Wimbledon and the  U.S. Open  last year,
will next face  Maria Kirilenko  after the 14th-seeded Russian
beat Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium 7-6 (7-4), 6-3.  Federer Fires  Record 17-time Grand Slam singles champion Federer ended
Australian  Bernard Tomic ’s unbeaten start to 2013 with a 6-4, 7-
6 (7-5), 6-1 victory at Rod Laver Arena, where he’s won four
titles. The Swiss, who fought back from 1-4 down in the
tiebreaker, next faces 13th-seeded Milos Raonic, who beat No. 17
seed Philipp Kohlschreiber of  Germany  in straight sets to tie
his best Grand Slam result by reaching the last 16.  “He’s got a monster of a serve,” Federer said of Canada’s
Raonic, who’s sent down a tournament-leading 71 aces including
one at 228 kilometers-per-hour that tied for fastest on the
men’s side. “I’m looking forward to a tough one.”  Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion from Argentina, was
beaten 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 3-6, 6-3 by the unseeded Jeremy Chardy of France. The 36th-ranked Chardy will next face 21st-
seeded Andreas Seppi, who outlasted No. 12 Marin Cilic of
 Croatia  in five sets.  Practice Partners  Third-seeded Murray of Britain defeated Lithuanian
qualifier Ricardas Berankis 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 to extend his winning
run at Grand Slams to 10 matches following his breakthrough
title at the U.S. Open in September.  Murray will next play No. 14 seed  Gilles Simon , who
defeated fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils in a five-set match that
lasted four hours, 43 minutes and finished at 12:31 a.m. local
time. The final set alone took 94 minutes.  “I was ready for this kind of fight,” Simon said after
winning 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 1-6, 8-6. “I really need to recover from
this one before I think about Andy.”  No. 7 seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, the 2008 runner-up in
Melbourne, beat Blaz Kavcic of Slovenia to set up an all-French
matchup with ninth-seeded  Richard Gasquet .  In other women’s results, two-time major winner  Svetlana Kuznetsova  of Russia advanced with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 win over
Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro and will next play former world
No. 1  Caroline Wozniacki  of  Denmark . Sloane Stephens of the U.S.
beat Britain’s Laura Robson 7-5, 6-3 in a matchup between the
only teenagers left in the women’s draw.  The run of 42-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm ended with a 6-2,
7-6 (7-3) defeat to Bojana Jovanovski, a player half her age.
Japan’s Date-Krumm was the oldest woman to reach the third round
of a Grand Slam since 1979.  To contact the reporter on this story:
