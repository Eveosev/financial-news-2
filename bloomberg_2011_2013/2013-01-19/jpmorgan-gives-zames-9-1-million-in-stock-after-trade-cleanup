JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  awarded co-
Chief Operating Officer  Matt Zames  $9.1 million in restricted
stock, more than anyone else on the firm’s operating committee,
after he helped the bank unwind botched trades.  Zames, the 42-year-old former co-head of fixed-income
trading, was promoted twice in 2012 as he helped Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon regain control of a U.K. unit’s wrong-way
bets on credit derivatives that cost more than $6.2 billion in
the first nine months of the year.  Zames received 196,437 restricted stock units valued at
$9.1 million based on yesterday’s closing stock price, according
to a regulatory filing today. Half vest in January 2015 and the
rest vest a year later. He also got 104,603 options with a 10-
year term and a strike price of $46.58 that become exercisable
in five installments starting next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
