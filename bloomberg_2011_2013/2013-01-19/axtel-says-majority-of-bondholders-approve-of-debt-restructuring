Axtel SAB,  Mexico ’s second-largest
landline telephone carrier, said a majority of creditors
accepted its debt-restructuring offer after the company improved
the terms of the exchange.  The bondholders accepted a combination of senior secured
debt, peso-denominated convertible bonds and cash, which would
replace dollar senior unsecured debt due in 2017 and 2019, Axtel
said in a statement late yesterday.  Axtel, based in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, unveiled a
new swap on Jan. 14 that improved the terms of its $765 million
debt restructuring after 40 percent of creditors rejected the
initial offer.  The company “obtained a satisfactory level of
participation that included the managers of accounts owning the
two largest holdings,” Chief Financial Officer Felipe Canales
said, according to the statement.  Axtel is in the process of selling tower assets to  American
Tower Corp. (AMT)  for $250 million in a transaction dependent upon the
success of the debt exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
