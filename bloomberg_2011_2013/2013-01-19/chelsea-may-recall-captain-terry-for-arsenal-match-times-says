Chelsea captain John Terry may be
recalled for tomorrow’s home game against Arsenal because
manager Rafael Benitez thinks the club lacks leadership, the
Times said.  Terry has not started since damaging knee ligaments against
Liverpool on Nov. 11. Benitez said the defender’s leadership
have been missed as there are few others who can replace him,
the Times said.  “John is one of the strong characters we have,” the Times
quoted Benitez as saying. “To have bodies, to have people with
this mentality can help. Hopefully, he will be fine.”  Chelsea has won just two of seven home matches since
Benitez was named interim manager in November. The Blues blew a
two-goal lead in drawing 2-2 with Southampton three days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
