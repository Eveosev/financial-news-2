Azeri police clashed with hundreds
of shopkeepers protesting rent increases south of the capital
Baku, the Prosecutor’s Office and the Ministry of Interior said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Demonstrators in Bina,  Azerbaijan ’s largest shopping
center, injured 10 police officers and damaged their cars, the
government said. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse the shopkeepers, who blocked a nearby highway.  Demonstrations are mostly prohibited in the energy-rich
former Soviet republic, which plans to hold presidential
elections in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
