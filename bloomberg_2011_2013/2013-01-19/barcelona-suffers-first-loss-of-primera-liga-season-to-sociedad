Barcelona suffered its first defeat
of the season in Spanish soccer’s Primera Liga as Real Sociedad
rallied for a 3-2 home win.  Lionel Messi  and  Pedro Rodriguez  had goals for Barcelona in
the opening 25 minutes and Gonzalo Castro scored for Sociedad
just before halftime.  Barcelona’s Gerard Pique was sent off in the 56th minute
for a second yellow card and Castro tied the score seven minutes
later. Imanol Agirretxe then scored the winning goal in the
first minute of injury time.  Barcelona entered the game having set a new league record
with 18 wins and one draw, against rival Real Madrid, to start
the season. It still leads Atletico Madrid, which plays Levante
tomorrow, by 11 points and is 18 points ahead of third-place
Real Madrid.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
