An Egyptian court dismissed cases
against 379 protesters accused of involvement in clashes with
police during protests near the  Interior Ministry  in November
2011 that left 42 people killed, state-run Middle East News
Agency reported.  The decision was based on President Mohamed Mursiâ€™s decree
pardoning everyone detained or sentenced from the start of the
revolution that toppled former President  Hosni Mubarak  on Jan.
25, 2011 until the day Mursi came into office in June 2012, MENA
said, citing the head of the Cairo Criminal Court, Judge Gamal
Eddin Safwat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
