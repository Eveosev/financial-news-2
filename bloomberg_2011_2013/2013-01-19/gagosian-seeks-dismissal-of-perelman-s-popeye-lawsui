Gallery owner  Larry Gagosian  asked a
 New York  judge to dismiss billionaire Ron Perelman’s lawsuit
accusing Gagosian of using his position in the art world to
negotiate secret deals and manipulate art prices.  The lawsuit, filed in September in New York State Supreme
Court in Manhattan, is based on transactions including one in
which Perelman claims Gagosian forced him to buy “Popeye,” a
granite sculpture of the cartoon character by  Jeff Koons  for
$4 million.  Gagosian said in a court filing yesterday that the case
should be dismissed as “meritless,” and that Perelman should
be sanctioned by the court because the suit’s true aim is to
harass Gagosian and harm his business.  In a $12.6 million art transaction, “Perelman proved to be
a deadbeat -- and then a bully -- when it came time to pay,”
according to yesterday’s filing.  Perelman accused Gagosian in his lawsuit of withholding
important information about the sales to enrich himself.  “These allegations were false when he first made them,
false when he withdrew the unsupported lawsuit, and are still
false today,” said  Christine Taylor , a spokeswoman for
Perelman, in an e-mail. “His call for sanctions is itself
sanctionable because it is frivolous and merely a smoke screen
to deflect from the real issues in our lawsuit.”  The case is MAFG Art Fund LLC v. Gagosian, 653189/2012, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
