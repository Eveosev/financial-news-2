U.S. President  Barack Obama 
condemned the terrorist attack at a natural-gas plant in
Algeria, saying “the thoughts and prayers of the American
people are with the families of allthose who were killed and
injured.”  “The blame for this tragedy rests with the terrorists who
carried it out, and the United States condemns their actions in
the strongest possible terms,” Obama said in an e-mailed
statement. “This attack is another reminder of the threat posed
by al Qaeda and other violent extremist groups in North
Africa.”  “We will remain in close touch with the government of
Algeria to gain a fuller understanding of what took place so
that we can work together to prevent tragedies like this in the
future,” Obama said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
