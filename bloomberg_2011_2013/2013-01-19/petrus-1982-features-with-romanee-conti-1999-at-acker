Bordeaux wines including 1982
 Chateau Petrus  and Burgundies featuring Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti vintages from the 1990s are being auctioned this month in
 Hong Kong  by New York-based  Acker Merrall & Condit .  A case of Pomerol producer Chateau Petrus 1982 is estimated
to fetch as much as HK$480,000 ($61,900) at the auction on Jan.
25 and Jan. 26, while three bottles of the rarer 1961 vintage by
the same producer are estimated at as much as HK$240,000.  The sale is taking place just before Chinese New Year in
February, when demand is traditionally high. It also comes after
wine sales by the biggest auction houses fell 19 percent last
year as economic and political uncertainty in  China  cooled
demand for top Bordeaux, at the same time as Chinese collectors
were focusing more on Burgundy. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of
leading Bordeaux wines fell 9.7 percent in 2012.  Among Burgundies in the sale, a six-magnum Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti assortment from 1990 may fetch as much as
HK$520,000, according to Acker, while a 12-bottle assortment of
DRC 1999 may sell for HK$400,000.  Other wines in the sale include individual magnums of
Chateau Cheval Blanc from the 1949, 1952 and 1961 vintages.  Sothebyâ€™s (BID)  also has a London sale at the end of January
after its U.K. auction last month, which featured wines from
Burgundy producer Henri Jayer.  Following is a list of global wine sales scheduled this
year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to auction
house sale catalogs and websites.
