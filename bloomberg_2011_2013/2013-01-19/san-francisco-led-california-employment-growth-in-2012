The  San Francisco  Bay Area, a region
that encompasses booming Silicon Valley, led  California  in job
growth last year as the technology industry workforce rose.  The area, home to Internet giants including  Facebook Inc. (FB) 
and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , gained 91,400 jobs in 2012, up 2.9 percent from
a year earlier, or more than twice the nationwide increase of
1.4 percent, said  Stephen Levy , director of the  Center for
Continuing Study of the California Economy  in  Palo Alto .  “Silicon Valley companies are once again leading the
nation,”  San Jose  Mayor Chuck Reed said in a statement. He said
the region was leading the state in its recovery from the
longest recession since the 1930s, which ended in 2009.  Unemployment in San Francisco fell to 6.5 percent in
December from 7.7 percent in the previous year, while Santa
Clara County, home to San Jose, dropped to 7.5 percent from 8.6
percent, according to data released yesterday by the California
Employment Development Department.  U.S. unemployment  was 7.8 percent last month or slightly
below its 8.1 percent average for 2012.  The jobless rate in California, the largest state by
population, decreased to 9.8 percent in December from 11.2
percent in the same month the year before.  “The  Bay Area  is expected to lead the state in job growth
in 2013, led by technology gains,” Levy said in a statement.
“California is now in a solid recovery mode with some upside
potential if housing construction takes off soon.”  The state, the world’s ninth-largest economy, gained
225,900 jobs in December compared with the same month the year
before, the data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
