The pound had its steepest weekly
drop against the dollar since June on concern the U.K. economy
is struggling to expand and as growing investor confidence in
the euro-area damps demand for the currency as a haven.  Sterling tumbled for a second week versus the euro as
excerpts from a planned speech by Prime Minister  David Cameron 
raised speculation Britain may move closer to exiting the 27-
nation European Union. Data this week showed retail sales
declined and inflation held at the highest rate since May last
month, adding to concern the U.K. will lose its top  credit
rating . Gross domestic product contracted in the fourth quarter,
according to economist estimates before the data next week.  “There’s been a general raft of bad data, combined with
nervousness ahead of the GDP and threats to the AAA rating,”
said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and
institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “We
are seeing huge volumes on the trading side so far this year.
Sterling is looking sick into next week’s data.”  The pound fell 1.7 percent to $1.5861 in the week to 5:46
p.m. London time yesterday, after sliding to $1.5854, the lowest
level since Nov. 16. The U.K. currency lost 1.5 percent to 83.83
pence per euro after depreciating to 83.95 pence, the weakest
since March 28.  The  10-year gilt  yield slid seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.01 percent, the biggest weekly decrease
this year. The price of the 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 rose 0.61 or 6.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 97.72.  The U.K. currency dropped as much as 0.9 percent against
the dollar yesterday, its biggest intraday tumble in two weeks.
The U.K. is rated AAA with negative outlook by  Standard &
Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings.  Rating Cuts  Rating cuts don’t always signal that bond prices will fall.
About half the time, government bond yields move in the opposite
direction suggested by new ratings, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg in June on 314 upgrades, downgrades and outlook
changes going back to 1974.  Sterling slid against all but two of its 16 major peers
this week amid concern that the U.K. economy contracted at the
end of last year. GDP fell 0.1 percent from the third quarter,
according to the median of 36 estimates in a Bloomberg survey
before the Jan. 25 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
