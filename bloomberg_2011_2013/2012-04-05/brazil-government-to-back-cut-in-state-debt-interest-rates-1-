Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff
will back a proposal in Congress that reduces interest payments
on debt owed by states to the federal government, Institutional
Affairs Minister Ideli Salvatti said.  States would be charged interest equivalent to the central
bank’s  Selic (BZSTSETA)  rate, currently at 9.75 percent, instead of a
formula that leads to payments of as much as 16 percent,
Salvatti said, according to the  transcript  of an interview
posted on the Ministry’s website. Support for the move will be
given in exchange for Congressional approval of a bill that
eliminates tax breaks some states grant to importers, Salvatti
said.  Lower interest payments by states opens room for more
spending at the local level, helping fuel demand,  Roberto
Padovani , chief economist at Votorantim CTVM Ltda, said in a
telephone interview. Since August, Rousseff’s administration has
reduced the benchmark interest rate five times, cut taxes and
pledged to boost investments in infrastructure as part of a plan
to ensure economic growth of at least 4.5 percent this year.  “It’s one more sign that we are trying to push the
economy, and this creates a challenge for the central bank to
anchor expectations because at the end of the day what you can
have is higher inflation,” Padovani said.  While annual inflation slowed to a 17-month low of 5.24
percent in March, it has remained above the central bank’s 4.5
percent target since September 2010.  States renegotiated their debts with the federal government
in 1997 and currently pay an  interest rate  of 6 percent to 9
percent on top of the  IGP-DI (IBREGPDY)  price index, which averaged 7.36
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
