The U.K. economy barely grew in the
first quarter after stagnating in the three months through
February, according to the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research.  Gross domestic product  probably rose 0.1 percent in the
period, Niesr, whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the
U.K. Treasury, said in an e-mailed statement in  London 
yesterday. It revised its figure for the quarter through
February from 0.1 percent growth previously.  The estimate follows data showing  industrial production 
rose 0.4 percent in February, and Niesr said the economy
probably avoided a technical recession of two consecutive
quarters of contraction. Surveys this week showed that growth in
services, manufacturing and construction accelerated in March.  “With such weak rates of growth, the U.K.’s negative
output gap is likely to widen,” the institute said. “But we do
expect this economic weakness to be temporary, with the recovery
taking hold in 2013.”  The Bank of England held its target for  bond purchases 
yesterday at 325 billion pounds ($515 billion) and kept its
benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent.  The  Office for National Statistics  will release its initial
estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 25 in London.   To contact the reporter on this story:
