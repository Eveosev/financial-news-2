K-Sea Transportation Partners LP (KSP) , a
tanker and tugboat operator, won a Delaware Chancery Court
judge’s dismissal of a investor lawsuit challenging terms of
last year’s $300 million takeover by  Kirby Corp. (KEX)   Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in Wilmington said company unit-
holders challenging fairness of the deal hadn’t proven
allegations that directors violated their obligations in the
buyout, according to a ruling made public today.  “The defendants’ approval of the merger agreement cannot
constitute a breach of any contractual or fiduciary duty” and
their disclosures “are not materially misleading,” Parsons
wrote in his 27-page opinion.  K-Sea, based in East Brunswick,  New Jersey , announced in
March 2011 that it would be bought by Houston-based Kirby for
$8.15 a share in cash or a cash-and-Kirby-stock combination. The
transaction closed on July 1, Parsons said.  The plaintiffs “cannot succeed on their claims under any
reasonably conceivable set of circumstances,” Parsons said in
dismissing the lawsuit.  Richard P. Falcinelli, executive vice president at K-Sea,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on
dismissal of the lawsuit. Plaintiffs’ lawyer Carmella Keener
didn’t immediately return voice and e-mail messages seeking
comment.  Kirby fell 15 cents to $65.24 at 12:49 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.  The case is Caldwell v. K-Sea, CA6301, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
