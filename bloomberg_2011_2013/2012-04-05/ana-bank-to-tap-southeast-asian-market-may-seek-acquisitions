Hana Bank (0286) ,  South Korea ’s fourth-
largest lender by assets, will tap fast-growing overseas markets
such as Southeast Asia, Chief Executive Officer Kim Jong Jun
said.  “We’ll first expand our existing presence there and may
seek acquisitions later to penetrate local markets in economies
including China, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines,” said
Kim, who took office last month. Speaking at a news briefing in
Seoul, he didn’t elaborate on a timeframe or potential targets.  His remarks echo comments by Kim Jung Tai, chairman of
parent company  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , who said last month
that he wants to make Hana Financial one of the top 50 banks in
the world by assets by 2015. Hana is also open to acquisitions
of small U.S. banks as it seeks growth beyond its saturated home
market, the chairman said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
