Spanish and Italian bonds led losses
among  Europe ’s higher-yielding government securities on
speculation authorities will struggle to stop the region’s debt
crisis from spreading.  Spain’s  10-year bonds  dropped for a third day after demand
fell at a debt sale yesterday and an International Monetary Fund
spokesman said the nation is facing “severe” challenges.
Germany’s two- and five-year  note yields  dropped to records as
investors sought the safest assets. The slide in Spanish
securities pushed 10-year yields to the highest since the
 European Central Bank  started providing three-year loans in
December in its longer-term refinancing operations.  “Spain is still the focus for the markets,” said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in  London . “The LTRO bid has faded away, and
that was evident from the auction results yesterday. The market
is still positioning for event risk, and that has supported the
move back to the safest assets.”  The Spanish 10-year yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.75 percent at 4:33 p.m. London time after
rising to 5.84 percent, the most since Dec. 13. The 5.85 percent
securities due January 2022 dropped 0.44, or 4.40 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,306) face amount, to 100.70.  The additional yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-
year bonds instead of similar-maturity German bunds expanded 11
basis points to 402 basis points after reaching 410, the widest
since Nov. 30.  ‘Severe’ Challenges  The IMF said  Spain ’s new budget proposal will need to be
assessed as the country struggles to meet European Union targets
and demand for the nation’s debt slumps.  “The challenges that Spain is facing are severe,” IMF
spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters in  Washington . “Market
sentiment remains volatile. This calls for sustaining the
reform.”  Credit-default swaps insuring Spanish bonds have surged 24
percent since the start of the year to 471 basis points,
according to CMA, signaling a worsening perception of the
country’s credit quality.  Spain sold a total of 2.59 billion euros of bonds
yesterday, less than its maximum target of 3.5 billion euros.  “The key in the near-term will be if the selloff we’ve
seen in Spain is going to continue, said  Richard McGuire , a
senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “Some investors have been remaining at the sidelines
given the Easter holidays and have been unwilling to initiate
new long positions ahead of this mini-break.” A long position
is a bet a security will rise.  Italian Bonds  Italy’s  10-year yield  rose seven basis points to 5.44
percent, with the spread over bunds widening 12 basis points to
370 basis points.  The nation plans to sell bills on April 11 and will auction
notes and bonds the following day.  French 10-year bonds slid for a fourth day as borrowing
costs increased when the nation sold 8.44 billion euros of debt.  France  auctioned 4.32 billion euros of benchmark 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 2.98 percent, more than the 2.91
percent paid at the last auction on March 1. The borrowing costs
for five-year and 15-year debt also rose, while those for the
30-year bonds fell.  The 10-year yield rose four basis points to 2.99 percent.  Record Low  German  notes  gained for a third day as investors sought
safer assets and a government report showed  industrial output 
declined in February.  Production decreased 1.3 percent from January, when it rose
a revised 1.2 percent, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said
today. Economists forecast a drop of 0.5 percent.  The German five-year yield declined five basis points to
0.72 percent after falling to 0.711 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. The two-year rate
reached a record low 0.133 percent.  The benchmark 10-year bund yield dropped five basis points
to 1.73 percent. It earlier declined to 1.72 percent, the least
since Nov. 10.  Germany ’s 10-year yield is consolidating, testing above and
below its range since March 29, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield may find support at the March 12 low of
1.74 percent, with resistance at the 50-day moving average of
1.88 percent.  A resistance level is an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to sell a security to be grouped and a support
level is an area where they expect buy orders to be clustered.  Volatility on Austrian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by Spain, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  German bunds have returned 0.3 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish debt dropped 0.6 percent,
and Italian bonds gained 9.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
