The French government will delay the
second round of bidding for offshore wind farms from the planned
date in April,  Les Echos  reported, citing unidentified industry
officials.  The size of the projects on offer is also likely to be
smaller than originally planned, Les Echos said, citing a figure
of between 750 megawatts to a maximum of 1,500 megawatts.  The government will make a decision on the first round of
bids for offshore wind farms either today or tomorrow, according
to the daily newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
