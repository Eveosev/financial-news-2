The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
build on its best first-quarter rally since 1998 and rise
another 11 percent to 1,550, according to an analysis by S&P
Capital IQ using the Fibonacci system to forecast stock prices.  That would lift the benchmark measure close to its peaks in
2000 and 2007 and represent a rebound of about 1.618 times the
drop in the index between May 2 and Oct. 4 of last year, said
Mark Arbeter, chief technical strategist at New York-based S&P
Capital IQ. The 1.618 factor, or golden ratio, is among the
patterns used in Fibonacci analysis.  That level is also where a  trend line  drawn from the
gauge’s highs in 2010 and 2011 meets another that’s connected
from the  S&P 500 ’s lows during the last quarter of 2011. The two
lines are projected to cross in July or July, when an “ultra-
bullish” scenario would take the index to 1,550, Arbeter said.  “You don’t usually see so many technical indicators lining
up and hitting one point in time,” he said in a phone interview
yesterday. “It makes it more likely that it can be achieved.”  The S&P 500 rallied 29 percent from its 2011 low in October
through April 2, including a 12 percent increase in the first
quarter, as data on manufacturing, real estate and the labor
market bolstered optimism about the world’s largest economy. The
index slipped in the past two days to close at 1,398.96 as
Federal Reserve minutes showed central bankers saw no need for
more monetary stimulus unless economic growth slows.  The S&P 500 suffered the bull market’s biggest retreat last
year, falling as much as 22 percent intraday from May to
October, amid concern surging sovereign debt in  Europe  and the
U.S. would tip the global economy into another recession.  It reached an intraday high of 1,552.87 on March 24, 2000,
and closed at an all-time high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
