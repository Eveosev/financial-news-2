A suicide attacker rammed his
motorbike into a convoy of police officials in  Pakistan ’s
Karachi, killing one person and wounding others.  The strike targeted a senior superintendent of police, who
survived with minor injuries, police officer Tahir Navaid said
by phone. “We can confirm the death of one vendor who was
selling vegetables from his cart,” Navaid said.  GEO television said four people had died with 13 injured.
The Tehreek-e-Taliban said it had ordered the attack, the
channel reported, without saying where it got the information.  While Karachi witnesses regular bouts of violence,
including gang wars and targeted assassinations of political
workers, it has seen fewer attacks by the Taliban and other
insurgent groups than other major Pakistani cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
