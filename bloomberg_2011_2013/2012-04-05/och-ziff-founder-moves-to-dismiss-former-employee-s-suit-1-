Daniel Och, founder of  Och-Ziff
Capital Management Group LLC (OZG) , asked a court to dismiss the
lawsuit brought by a former employee who accused Och of forcing
him out to boost his own interest in the company.  The former employee, Arnaud Achache, filed the lawsuit in
New York state  Supreme Court  in  Manhattan  on March 9, seeking
more than $50 million in actual damages and more than $100
million in punitive damages.  The plaintiffs, Achache and a family trust under his
control established for estate planning purposes, voluntarily
executed a separation agreement and “general release” in May
2009 “that released and forever discharged all of the claims
asserted in this action,” lawyers for Och said in court
documents filed yesterday.  Achache and the trust, which were limited partners in
various Och-Ziff entities between 2006 and 2009, were allowed to
convert more than $15 million of their restricted stock into
“unrestricted and liquid public securities,” Och’s lawyers
said in the filings.  “All of plaintiffs’ causes of action concern plaintiffs’
objections to the ways in which their partnership interests were
restructured in 2007 -- the very subject of the general release
executed in 2009,” lawyers for Och said in the documents.
“Now, nearly three years later, plaintiffs ask this court to
disregard the general release and allow them to pursue related
claims.”  The case is Achache v. Och, 650737/2012, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
