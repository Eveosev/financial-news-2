French 10-year bonds declined for a
fourth day before the nation sells as much as 8.5 billion euros
($11.2 billion) of securities.  German bunds erased an earlier loss before a  report  that
economists said will show industrial production in the country
fell in February, boosting demand for safer assets. The U.S.
Labor Department will release its monthly job report tomorrow as
European bond markets close for the four-day Easter holiday.  France  is “under a bit of pressure in a thin market,”
said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in London. “It’s definitely the standout poor
performer, right in front of supply in this type of environment
and also right in front of payrolls. The auction itself will go
OK,” he said  France’s  10-year yield  increased five basis points, or 0.05
percentage points, to 3 percent at 9:45 a.m.  London  time. The 3
percent bond due April 2022 fell 0.43, or 4.30 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,316) face amount, to 99.97.  The 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.79 percent,
after dropping to 1.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since March
13. The yield is little changed this week.  The  additional yield  investors demand to hold French 10-
year securities instead of similar-maturity bunds widened five
basis points to 121 basis points.  French bonds dropped as the nation prepares to sell debt
maturing between 2017 and 2041, including the bond acting as the
nation’s 10-year benchmark.  German Output  German industrial output contracted 0.5 percent in
February, after climbing 1.6 percent the previous month,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
the region’s economic outlook remained subject to “downside
risks.” He was speaking in  Frankfurt  after the ECB kept its
main  refinancing rate  at a record low 1 percent.  German bunds have returned 0.3 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French debt gained 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
