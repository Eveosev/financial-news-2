The Canadian government said it will
review  Target Corp. (TGT) ’s C$1.83 billion ($1.84 billion) purchase of
store leases from Zellers Inc. under a “cultural heritage”
provision in the nation’s foreign-takeover law.  The government said in an order posted on the Privy Council
Office website that it will review the acquisition under a
section of the law that relates to Canada’s “cultural heritage
or national identity.”  “The government is committed to ensuring that foreign
investments benefit Canadians,” said James Maunder, a spokesman
for Heritage Minister  James Moore  who recommended the review.
“We will review Target’s proposal and make an announcement in
due course,” Maunder said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
