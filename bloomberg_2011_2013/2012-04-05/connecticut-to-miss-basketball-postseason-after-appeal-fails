The  University of Connecticut  men’s
basketball team will miss next year’s postseason after an appeal
against a ban for failing to meet minimum academic standards was
rejected by the college sports governing body.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  announced the
sanction last year after the  Huskies  defeated Butler 53-41 to
win their third national basketball championship.  The decision was based on the team’s  Academic Performance
Rate  -- a measurement of how well sports teams move their
athletes toward graduation -- from 2007-08 through 2010-11.
Teams that fail to stay on course to graduate about 50 percent
of their athletes are subject to penalties ranging from less
practice time to a loss of scholarships and a postseason ban.  “While we as a university and coaching staff clearly
should have done a better job academically with our men’s
basketball student-athletes in the past, the changes we have
implemented have already had a significant impact and have
helped us achieve the success we expect in the classroom,”
men’s basketball coach  Jim Calhoun  said in a statement. “We
will continue to strive to maintain that success.”  The  Big East Conference  recently voted to ban any school
that is ineligible for the NCAA postseason from its own league
championship at Madison Square Garden in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
