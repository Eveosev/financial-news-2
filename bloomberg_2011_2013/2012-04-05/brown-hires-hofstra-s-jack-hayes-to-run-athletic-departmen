Hofstra University’s  Jack Hayes  was
named athletic director at  Brown University , replacing Michael Goldberger, who will retire at the end of the academic year.  Hayes, wrapping up his eighth year as athletic director at
Hofstra, led the Pride to 21 Colonial Athletic Association
championship titles and 35 postseason appearances, including 26
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments.  A native of Brown’s hometown of Providence, Rhode Island,
Hayes will oversee the Ivy League school’s 37 varsity and 17
club teams. He is a former lacrosse player at Providence College
who worked at Fairfield, St. John’s and Fordham universities
before moving to the University of Connecticut in 2001 as
associate athletic director. He joined Hofstra, based in
Hempstead,  New York , three years later.  “Brown’s tradition of academic and athletic excellence was
the principal actor in my candidacy for the position,” Hayes
said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
