SAP AG (SAP) , the biggest maker of
enterprise-management software, said Robert Courteau, the
president of its North America operations, has left the company
at his own request after 15 months in the job.  Courteau, who joined SAP in 2004, was appointed to the
position in January last year. Robert Enslin, the company’s head
of global sales who previously held the post, will assume
Courteau’s responsibilities until a replacement is found,
spokesman Christoph Liedtke said in a telephone interview today.
He declined to discuss Courteau’s future plans.  The U.S. business accounted for 26 percent of SAP’s revenue
last year, according to Bloomberg data. Total revenue from the
country rose 14 percent from 2010, exceeding the 12 percent
growth reported for Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa.
Walldorf, Germany-based SAP fell as much as 93 cents, or 1.8
percent, to 50.32 euros and traded 1.3 percent lower as of 3:59
p.m. in Frankfurt.  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  added 0.7 percent to $29.37 in
New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
