Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) , a home decor
and housewares retailer, jumped the most in almost a year after
its fourth-quarter earnings topped analysts’ estimates
yesterday.  The company  rose  8.5 percent to $71.85 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since April 7 last year and the stock’s
highest value since the company sold shares in 1992. The stock
has gained 24 percent this year.  Net income  increased 24 percent to $351 million, or $1.48 a
share, in the three months ended Feb. 25, compared with $283
million, or $1.12, a year ago, the Union, New Jersey-based
company said in a statement yesterday. Analysts projected profit
of $1.32 a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Bed Bath & Beyond, along with other retailers, benefited
from favorable weather during the holiday season, which helped
boost sales during the fourth quarter. Comparable-store sales
rose 6.8 percent in the period.  The company  forecast  first-quarter earnings per share
excluding certain items will be about 79 cents to 83 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
