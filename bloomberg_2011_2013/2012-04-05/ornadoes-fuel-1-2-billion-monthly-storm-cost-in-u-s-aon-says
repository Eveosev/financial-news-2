Severe weather in the U.S., led by
tornadoes in the Midwest and Tennessee Valley, caused more than
$1.2 billion of insured losses in March, according to  Aon Corp. (AON) ,
the world’s biggest insurance broker.  Insurers reported more than 170,000 claims tied to storms
from March 2 and 3, London-based Aon said in a  report  today. The
insured losses exceeded $1.1 billion. Severe weather in the
Great Lakes region in the middle of the month cost the industry
more than $150 million, according to the report.  U.S. insurers incurred catastrophe losses totaling $35.9
billion in 2011 from disasters including  Hurricane Irene  in
August, according to the  Insurance Information Institute . That
exceeded the average of $23.8 billion from 2000 to 2010.
Insurers including  Travelers Cos. (TRV)  and  Allstate Corp. (ALL)  cover
property in the U.S.  “Following an active 2011 U.S. severe weather season, the
first quarter of 2012 has also proven itself to be markedly
busy,” Steve Jakubowski, president of Impact Forecasting, said
in the statement.  Natural disasters in March included flooding in  Hawaii  and
Louisiana and wildfire in Colorado, Aon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
