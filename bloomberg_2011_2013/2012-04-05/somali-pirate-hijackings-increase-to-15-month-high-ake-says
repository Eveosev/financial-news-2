Somali pirates hijacked 10 ships in
March, the most since December 2010, and may attack larger
merchant vessels this month, AKE Intelligence said.  Four of the seized craft were used to make more attacks,
rather than being held for ransom, Rory Lamrock, piracy analyst
at the Hereford, England-based security and risk-assessment
company, said in an e-mailed report today.  “Pirate syndicates will be emboldened by the latest
hijackings, spurring them on to conduct more attacks over the
coming weeks,” Lamrock said. “Weather conditions are also
forecast to be relatively calm in April, which will make it
easier for pirates to launch skiffs and gain access to the deck
of a targeted vessel.”  Somali pirate attacks rose to a record 237 in 2011, with
ransoms worth $160 million paid to release 31 hijacked vessels,
a One Earth Future Foundation report released Feb. 8 showed.
Pirates based in Somalia cost governments and the shipping
industry as much as $6.9 billion last year, One Earth estimates.  Pirates are holding 13 vessels with 197 hostages,  according 
to the London-based International Maritime Bureau’s Piracy
Reporting Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
