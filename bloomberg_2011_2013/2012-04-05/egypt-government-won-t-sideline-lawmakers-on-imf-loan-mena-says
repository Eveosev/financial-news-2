Egypt ’s finance minister said the
government is committed to working with the parliament on a
proposed $3.2 billion International Monetary Fund loan, the
official Middle East News Agency reported today.  Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed also denied comments
attributed to him by the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper yesterday
in which he reportedly said discussions between the government
and lawmakers had helped ease objections over the loan, MENA
reported.  Those remarks drew a quick rebuke from within the Muslim
Brotherhood, whose political arm controls almost half of the
parliament’s lower house. The Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice
Party has voiced opposition to the loan, and maintains the
government is moving ahead without consulting lawmakers.  El-Saieed said securing the loan would help attract new
donor funds and investment from abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
