Greek economic sentiment improved in
March as the country’s debt restructuring and rescue plan eased
concerns the country would exit the euro area.  An index measuring short-term economic trends rose to 75.7
in March, from 74.9 in February, the Athens-based  Foundation for
Economic & Industrial Research , known as IOBE, said in an e-
mailed report today.  Consumer confidence  improved 4.2 points to
minus 79.3, the foundation said.  Greece ’s government last month carried out the biggest
sovereign debt restructuring in history and secured a 130
billion-euro ($170 billion) loan package, the country’s second
international bailout, from the European Union and  International
Monetary Fund .  “The lifting of the  currency risk , the successful
implementation of the bond swap program and the expectation of
the banks’ recapitalization have helped stabilize the economic
climate,” IOBE said in the statement. “Uncertainties about the
course of the economy remain, as implementation requirements of
the new financing program are many and complex.”  Greece’s economy is set to shrink for a fifth year in 2012
after a 6.9 percent contraction last year. Unemployment jumped
to 21 percent in December, according to the Hellenic Statistical
Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
