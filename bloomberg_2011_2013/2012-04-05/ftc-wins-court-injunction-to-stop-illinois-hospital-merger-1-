The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
won a preliminary injunction from a federal judge to stop the
proposed merger of  OSF Healthcare System (79678MF)  and Rockford Health
System, both closely held companies based in  Illinois .  U.S. District Judge Frederick Kapala in Rockford, Illinois,
ordered the two hospitals not to complete their merger, which
was announced in January 2011, pending an administrative trial
by the FTC.  After an investigation, the agency found the proposed
merger would violate antitrust laws and started an
administrative proceeding to block it, according to the court
order.  Kapala said the FTC presented a “very compelling” case
that the proposed merger would hurt competition for hospital
services in the Rockford market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
