Egypt ’s constitution-drafting
committee decided to push ahead with its work amid a boycott by
many of its secular members who say Islamists are trying to
monopolize the political process.  “We won’t delay the work of the committee,” Parliament
Speaker Saad el-Katatni, the panel’s chief and a member of the
Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party, said during the
televised session last night on Nile News. El-Katatni said 11
members have confirmed their withdrawal and they have until
early next week to decide on a proposal to replace them with
members from a list of alternates. More than 20 people and
groups have released statements saying they were pulling out
from the 100-member committee.  The two Islamist parties with the most seats in parliament
dominate the constitution assembly, a group of secular party
leaders and prominent Egyptians said on April 3, while
constitutions should be drafted by consensus. The Muslim
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party alliance won about half
of the seats of parliament’s lower house followed by a more
conservative bloc of Salafis.  Those boycotting the panel, including representatives of Al-
Azhar, the Sunni Muslim world’s pre-eminent religious
institution, and the Coptic Church, have rejected the suggestion
that members be replaced. Secular parties have demanded that the
committee is scrapped and that the process begin anew.  To contact the reporter on this story:
