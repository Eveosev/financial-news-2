Consumer confidence  climbed last
week to the highest level in four years and unemployment claims
fell, pointing to a brighter job market that may invigorate the
 U.S. economy .  The Bloomberg Consumer  Comfort Index (COMFCOMF)  rose to minus 31.4 in
the period ended April 1, the best reading since March 2008,
from minus 34.7 the prior week. Filings for jobless benefits
dropped by 6,000 to 357,000 in the week ended March 31, the
fewest since April 2008, the Labor Department said.  Employers probably took on more than 700,000 workers in the
first three months of this year, the best quarter for job growth
since 2006, a report tomorrow may show, while equities rallied
the most since 1998. The improvements may support  consumer
spending  in the face of rising gasoline prices.  “There’s a gradual acceleration underway in the economy,”
said  Michael Englund , chief economist at Action Economics LLC in
Boulder,  Colorado , and the second-most accurate forecaster of
unemployment applications. “Today’s claims data and confidence
reading put a positive spin going into tomorrow’s payroll
report,” he said, projecting 210,000 jobs were created in
March.  The stronger labor market helped reduce consumer-loan
delinquencies in the fourth quarter to 2.49 percent from 2.59
percent in the previous three months, the  American Bankers
Association  said. The data showed that for the first time in
eight years, all 11 loan categories showed a decrease in
delinquencies.  CEO Confidence  Sentiment is picking up among chief executives as well. The
Conference Board in  New York  said today that its measure of CEO
confidence increased to 63 in the first quarter from 49 in the
October to December period. Readings greater than 50 show more
corporate heads are upbeat about the economy.  Canada is sharing in the labor market recovery. The world’s
10th largest economy added 82,300 jobs in March, the most since
2008, after losing 2,800 the prior month,  Statistics Canada  said
today in Ottawa. The jobless rate dropped to 7.2 percent, the
lowest since September.  American payrolls grew by 227,000 in February, capping the
best six-month streak of job growth since 2006, Labor Department
data showed last month. A report tomorrow will probably show
employment increased by 205,000 in March, according to the
median forecast in a survey of economists by Bloomberg News.  Stocks in the U.S. erased losses after the jobless claims
figures. The  S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent to 1,400.64 at 11:06 a.m.
in New York.  Democrats, Independents  The Bloomberg consumer sentiment figures showed some good
news for President Barack Obama’s re-election bid. Democrats’
confidence rose to minus 25.2, and that of political
independents increased to minus 29.1, both the best since 2007.  The  measure  of Americans’ views of the state of the economy
rose to minus 63.6, also the best reading since March 2008, from
minus 66.7 the prior week. The personal finances  gauge  broke
into positive territory, climbing to 3.4, the highest level
since July. The  index  of whether consumers consider it a good
time to buy rose to minus 33.9 from minus 37.  “Confidence is critical,” Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, chief
economist at  Ford Motor Co. (F) , said April 3 on a conference call
with analysts. Recent data show “consumers are pointing to the
job prospects. Confidence is sort of keying off the job numbers
in some sense.”  Cars and light trucks sold at a 14.3 million  annual rate  in
March, capping the strongest quarter in four years, according to
data from Ward’s Automotive Group.  Higher Share Prices  Rising stock values have also probably buoyed sentiment.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced  12 percent during the
first quarter, including a 3.1 percent increase in March. It
marked the strongest three-month start to a year since a 13.5
percent advance in the first quarter of 1998.  Among households earning more than $100,000 per year,
sentiment climbed to 10.2, the strongest since December 2010.  With a better labor market, more confidence and higher
stock values, household spending climbed in February by the most
in seven months. Purchases rose 0.8 percent, Commerce Department
data showed last week.  “The Bloomberg index’s positive run is all the more
impressive because it’s occurred in tandem with steadily rising
gasoline prices,”  Gary Langer , president of Langer Research
Associates LLC in New York, which compiles the index for
Bloomberg, said in a statement.  Pump Prices  The average  price  of regular gasoline at the pump climbed
to a 10-month high of $3.94 a gallon yesterday, according to
AAA, the nation’s largest motoring club. It has risen 66 cents,
or 20 percent, since the year began.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index is based on responses
to telephone interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers
aged 18 and over. Each week, 250 respondents are asked for their
views on the economy, personal finances and buying climate; the
percentage of negative responses is subtracted from the share of
positive views and divided by three. The most recent reading is
based on the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  Field work for the index is done by SSRS/Social Science
Research Solutions in Media,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
