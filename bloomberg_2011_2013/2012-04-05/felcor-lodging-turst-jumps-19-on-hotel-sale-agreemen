FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. (FCH) , a real
estate investment trust, that owns interests in hotels in the
U.S. and  Canada , rose the most in more than two years after
announcing the sale of six hotels.  FelCor, based in Irving,  Texas , rose 19 percent to $4.28
after agreeing to sell six “non-strategic” hotels for $103
million to an undisclosed buyer. It plans to repay $73 million
of secured debt and other costs when the sale closes and use the
remaining $30 million to pay part of its accrued preferred
dividends.  The transaction is expected to close late in the second
quarter.  Trading volume  was almost 6 million shares, more than
10 times the 20-day average volume of 588,135. The shares have
gained 40 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
