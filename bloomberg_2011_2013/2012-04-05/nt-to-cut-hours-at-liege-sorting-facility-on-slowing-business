TNT Express NV (TNTE) , the Dutch express-
delivery company that  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  agreed to buy
for $6.8 billion, plans to cut the hours of 1,130 workers at its
Liege,  Belgium , sorting facility after business slowed.  The reductions will come into effect on April 16 and last
until the end of June, Cyrille Gibot, a spokesman for Hoofddorp,
Netherlands-based TNT Express, said by telephone. There will be
a maximum cut of two working days per employee per week.  “There will be a rotation system so that at any one time
there will be reduced working hours for 650 people at night and
100 people working during the day,” Gibot said, adding that
there are no plans at this stage to reduce hours elsewhere in
the business.  United Parcel Service agreed to buy TNT for 9.5 euros a
share, valuing TNT at 13 times its last four quarters’ earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.  Europe ’s
second-largest express-delivery service posted an operating loss
of 105 million euros ($137 million) in 2011.  The reduced hours were reported earlier by Belgium’s L’Echo
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
