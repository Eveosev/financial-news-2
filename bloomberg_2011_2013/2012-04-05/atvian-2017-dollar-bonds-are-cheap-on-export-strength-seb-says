Latvia’s dollar-denominated bonds
due in 2017 are “particularly cheap” because the Baltic
country’s exports are less exposed to  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis than neighboring  Lithuania ’s,  SEB AB (SEBA)  said.  The Stockholm-based bank recommended investors buy Latvia’s
five-year dollar bonds over the Lithuanian equivalent as they
yield 20 basis points more while credit-default swaps signal
“approximately equal risks” for the two countries, strategists
Mats Lind and Jurgis Rosickas, wrote today in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
