Howard University (85015MF)  has suspended some
student-athletes while it investigates the possibility of
National Collegiate Athletic Association rules violations, a
school spokeswoman said.  “The university temporarily withheld a number of student-
athletes from competition as a self-imposed action,” Kerry-Ann
Hamilton said yesterday in an e-mail. “Most teams will compete
as scheduled.”  The Washington-based school declined to elaborate on the
target of its investigation.  “To protect the integrity of this review, we are unable to
share additional details at this time,” Hamilton said.  An unidentified softball player told the Washington Post
that Howard was looking at allegations that some athletes were
allegedly keeping the difference between the actual cost of
their textbooks and their textbook allowance.  Under NCAA rules, student-athletes who profit from their
textbook allowances are ineligible until the money is refunded,
the Post said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
