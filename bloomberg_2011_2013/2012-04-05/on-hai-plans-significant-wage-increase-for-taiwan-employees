Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.,
manufacturer of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhones and iPads, plans to give
Taiwan employees a “significant” wage increase from July to
keep workers at its headquarters happy and offset rising living
costs.  “We want to raise wages to increase the company’s
competiveness in attracting and retaining good quality staff,”
Simon Hsing, spokesman for the Taipei-based company said by
phone today without specifying the size of the increase. “We
also hope that rising living costs won’t impact employees, so we
are happy to set a trend for wage rises in the industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
