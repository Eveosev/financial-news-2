Uganda  boosted electricity supply by
50 megawatts after its 250-megawatt Bujagali hydropower plant
doubled supply to the national grid to 100 megawatts after
commissioning a second turbine, Daily Monitor reported.  The additional generation by the plant, which started
supplying 50 megawatts to the national grid in February, will
reduce daily power outages to around two hours from 12 hours,
the Kampala-based newspaper cited Minister of State for Energy
Simon Dâ€™Ujanga as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
