Alliance Oil Company Ltd., (AOIL)  an
explorer in Russia, declined to an almost three-year low in
Stockholm trading after cutting its production estimate.  Alliance dropped as much as 8.6 percent to the lowest since
April 14, 2009. It cut the 2012 average daily estimate for so-
called upstream production from  oil fields  to 55,000 to 60,000
barrels from 63,000 to 69,000 barrels, according to a statement.  The company held its guidance for average daily output from
oil refining at 68,000 to 73,000 barrels and said so-called
downstream production was strong in the first quarter. “Higher
international oil prices and domestic crude netbacks largely
compensated lower volumes in the upstream segment compared to
the preceding quarter,” Managing Director Arsen Idrisov said.  Alliance declined by 8.2 percent to 64.50 kronor by 10:54
a.m. in  Stockholm , the fourth-worst performer on the benchmark
Stockholm All Share index of local equities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
