First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) ,
Canada’s second-largest copper producer, gained the most in more
than four months after U.K. newspapers speculated that the
company may be a takeover target.  First Quantum rose 7.1 percent to C$19.69 at the close in
Toronto, the most since Nov. 30.  There is “talk that Rio Tinto, Glencore and possibly a
Chinese company may be looking” at First Quantum, The Guardian
said on its  website .  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  are the most probable
suitors for First Quantum, Ash Lazenby, a London-based analyst
at Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note today. The list of
potential buyers is relatively small, he said.  First Quantum president Clive Newall didn’t return a call
seeking comment. James Wyatt-Tilby, a spokesman for London-based
Anglo American, declined to comment. Simon Buerk, a spokesman
for Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, and Tony Shaffer, a
spokesman for London-based Rio, couldn’t be reached for comment.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B)  is the biggest Canadian base-metals
producer by revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
