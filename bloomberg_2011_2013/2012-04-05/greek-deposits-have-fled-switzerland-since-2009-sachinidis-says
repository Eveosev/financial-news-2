Greek citizens have been pulling
deposits out of  Switzerland  since 2009, according to information
that shows a decline in income from withholding taxes on Swiss
accounts, Finance Minister Filippos Sachinidis said.  Income from withholding tax on interest from Greek
taxpayers’ accounts in Switzerland dropped to 5.9 million euros
($7.7 million) in 2010 from 9.9 million euros in 2009,
Sachinidis said in a ministry statement today.  The drop shows there is a trend of “directing savings
deposits toward countries that are not subject to the
implementation of community law,” Sachinidis said.  Less than 10 percent of a total 16 billion euros of Greek
deposit outflows that went abroad since the end of 2009 have
gone to Switzerland, former Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos
said Feb. 3.  To contact the reporters on this story:
