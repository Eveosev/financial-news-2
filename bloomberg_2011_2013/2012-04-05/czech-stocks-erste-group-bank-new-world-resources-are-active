The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell for a fourth day, sliding 1.1 percent to 935.1 at the end
of trading in Prague.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   of  Austria  fell 2.9 percent
to 390.7 koruna, its lowest close since Jan. 20. Lenders were
among the worst performers in Europe today as rising borrowing
costs for Spain in France renewed concern that the region’s debt
crisis may not be contained.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, slumped 2.6 percent to 125.7 koruna, its lowest
close since December.  Emerging-market stocks fell as much as 0.8 percent as
Spanish bonds slid after weak demand at an auction renewed
concerns  Europe  won’t contain its debt crisis. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index last traded unchanged at 1,037.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
