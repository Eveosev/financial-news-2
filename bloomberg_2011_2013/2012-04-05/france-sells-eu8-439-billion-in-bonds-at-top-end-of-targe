France  sold 8.44 billion ($11.02
billion) in bonds, close to the maximum it sought, as demand for
the securities held up in the face of the country’s presidential
election and investor concern about neighboring  Spain .  The sale was at the top of the treasury’s planned range of
between 7 billion and 8.5 billion euros. The bid-to-cover ratio,
or the demand relative to the amount sold, was 2.65, up from 
2.47 at the last auction and higher than the 2011 average. While 
the borrowing cost on 10-year debt was higher than in the last
auction on March 1, the 30-year yield fell.  “The market is giving France the benefit of the doubt,”
said Nicola Marinelli, who oversees $153 million at Glendevon
King Asset Management in  London . “They want to see who gets
elected and what exactly they’re going to do. Even with a bad
auction from Spain, we’re not back in panic mode.”  The French auction comes a day after Spain sold 2.9 billion
euros in debt, near the minimum planned, with a jump in
borrowing costs, underlining investor concern that the euro
area’s sovereign debt crisis is far from over. With French
voters preparing to go to the polls in less than three weeks,
investors are also watching for signs that the nation’s economic
reforms will be maintained after the presidential vote.  France sold 4.32 billion euros of benchmark 10-year debt at
an average yield of 2.98 percent, more than the 2.91 percent
paid at the last auction. The borrowing costs for five-year and
15-year debt also rose.  Bond Trading  French 10-year bonds stayed lower after the sale. The 10-
year bond yield rose five basis points to 2.98 percent as of
12:01 p.m. Paris time. The  premium France pays  over  Germany  to
borrow has also gained this week, to 126 basis points today from
114 points a week ago.  The euro extended its decline against the Japanese yen to
its weakest since March 8.  The yield difference, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
bonds and similar-maturity German bunds rose to more than 400
basis points, or 4 percentage points, for the first time since
Dec. 12.  Yesterday’s Spanish sale was the first since Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro presented the government’s 2012
spending plan on March 30 and said public debt will rise to 79.8
percent of gross domestic product, the highest since at least
1980, even as the government makes the deepest budget cuts in
three decades.  To contact the reporter on this story:
