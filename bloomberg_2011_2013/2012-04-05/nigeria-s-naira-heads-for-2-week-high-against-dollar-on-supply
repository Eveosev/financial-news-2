Nigeria ’s naira strengthened against
the dollar and headed for the highest close in more than two
weeks on a tight supply of the currency and dollar inflows.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer gained 0.1
percent to 157.55 per dollar on the interbank market as of 11:10
a.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, heading for the highest
close since March 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The naira has gained 3 percent this year.  The Central Bank of Nigeria has kept interest rates at a
record high of 12 percent this year and  sold $250 million  at
foreign exchange auctions this week.  “Tight liquidity conditions, real  interest rates  and
improved market confidence have probably contributed to this
trend,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging markets strategist at Standard
Bank Group Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mailed reply to
questions today. “The naira is supported by consistent foreign
exchange oil flows and offshore inflows into Nigerian treasury
bills.”  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds
declined 3 basis points, or 0.03 percent, to 5.379 percent in
London. Borrowing costs on the West African nation’s naira bonds
due 2019 fell two basis points to 15.29 percent yesterday,
according to the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Nigeria’s foreign reserves have risen 8.8 percent this year
to $35.8 billion as of April 3,  central bank  data show. The
nation’s benchmark  bonny light crude  has gained 13.7 percent
this year.  Ghana’s cedi fell for a third day, weakening 0.2 percent to
1.7875 per dollar, as of 10:20 a.m. in Accra, the capital. The
cedi has declined 8.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
