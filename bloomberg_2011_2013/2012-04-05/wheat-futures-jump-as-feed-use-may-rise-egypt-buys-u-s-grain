Wheat gained the most this week on
speculation that U.S. cattle producers will use more of the
grain in feed rations amid rising corn prices and after  Egypt 
today said it filled a tender exclusively from U.S. inventories.  Before today, wheat futures in Chicago lost 2.1 percent
this year, and the price in Kansas City has declined 5.3
percent. Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed, rose 1.6
percent. Some cattle feeders have said they will add wheat to
rations by July, said  Tom Leffler , the owner of Leffler
Commodities LLC in August, Kansas. Egypt said it bought 115,000
metric tons of the grain from the U.S.  “There’s definitely a little more push toward feeding
wheat,” Jon Marcus, the president of Lakefront Futures and
Options LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “This
could be a proactive move on Egypt’s part. We’ll probably see
more and more buying on these price dips.”  Wheat futures for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$6.4125 a bushel at 9:54 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
U.S. is the world’s largest exporter and Egypt is the biggest
importer of the grain.  The price has declined this year on forecasts from the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  that global stockpiles will rise 5.1
percent to a record 209.6 million tons by the end of the season
on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
