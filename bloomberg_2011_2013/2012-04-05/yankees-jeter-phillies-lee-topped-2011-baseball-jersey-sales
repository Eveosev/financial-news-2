The jersey of New York Yankees’ All-
Star shortstop Derek Jeter was the biggest seller in Major
League Baseball last year as he surpassed the 3,000-hit plateau.  Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Cliff Lee’s jersey ranked
second and  Albert Pujols ’s was third, Major League Baseball and
its players’ association said in a joint statement. Pujols led
the  St. Louis Cardinals  to a World Series title before signing
with the Los Angeles Angels in December and both teams’ jerseys
were reflected in the year’s figures.  The Texas Rangers’ Josh Hamilton ranked fourth, followed by
the Phillies’ Roy Halladay, San Francisco Giants’ Tim Lincecum
and the Boston Red Sox’s Dustin Pedroia.  Ryan Braun  of the Milwaukee Brewers was eighth, followed by
Hunter Pence, who played for both the Houston Astros and
Phillies. The Giants’ Buster Posey completed the top 10.  Jeter, the Yankees’ captain, batted .297 with six home runs
and 61 runs batted in last season, his 17th as a major-leaguer.
After signing a contract extension the previous offseason, Jeter
had five hits on July 9 to become the 28th player in major-
league history to surpass 3,000 for his career.  To contact the reporter on this story:
