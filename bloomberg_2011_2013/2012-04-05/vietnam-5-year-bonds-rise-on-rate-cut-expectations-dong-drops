Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose the
most in almost two weeks on speculation slowing growth and
easing inflation will trigger interest-rate cuts. The dong fell.  Consumer prices  advanced 14.15 percent in March from a year
earlier, the least in a year, according to data released March
24 by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi. Slowing inflation
may allow the nation to cut borrowing costs by 100 basis points
in each of the three remaining quarters this year, central bank
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said last month.  “The expectations are for lower yields,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital
Securities. “Investors are looking to buy back bonds.”  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 11.47 percent according to
a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was
biggest drop since March 23.  Gross domestic product  increased 4 percent in the three
months through March from a year earlier, the least since 2009,
official data released March 29 showed.  The dong weakened 0.5 percent to 20,835 per dollar as of
3:35 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
