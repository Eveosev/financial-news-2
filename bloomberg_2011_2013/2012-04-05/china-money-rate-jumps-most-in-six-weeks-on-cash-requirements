China ’s money-market rate rose the
most in more than six weeks on speculation cash supply will wane
as banks set aside more funds to meet  reserve requirements .  Chinese lenders have to park money with the central bank on
the 5th, 15th and 25th of each month. The seven-day  repurchase
rate , which measures interbank funding availability, touched a
five-week high even as the People’s Bank of China added a net 25
billion yuan ($4 billion) to the banking system this week.  “The loan-to-deposit ratio requirement may have prompted
banks to boost deposits substantially at the end of last month,
which means they will have to pay a lot of cash today,” said
Guo Caomin, a Shanghai-based fixed-income analyst at Industrial
Bank Co. Markets reopened today after a three-day holiday.  The seven-day repo rate rose 54 basis points to 3.99
percent as of 4:56 p.m. in  Shanghai , the biggest increase since
Feb. 17, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank issued 5 billion yuan of 91-day  repurchase
agreements  today, the  least  since August 2011, according to a
statement on its website.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, climbed four basis
point, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.18 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.94 percent government bonds due January
2021 was little changed at 3.51 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
