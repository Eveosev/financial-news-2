index fell to its lowest in three months amid weaker employment
gains and a drop in inventories.  The  index  dropped to 63.5 in March on a seasonally adjusted
basis, following a February reading of 66.5, according to a
statement on the University of Western Ontario business school’s
 website . Economists forecast a 65.5 reading, based on the median
of 13 responses to a Bloomberg News survey. Readings of more

jobs in March and the  unemployment rate  fell to 7.2 percent from
7.4 percent. The Ivey employment index fell to 52.7 from 58.8,
indicating that employment growth slowed, while the inventory
