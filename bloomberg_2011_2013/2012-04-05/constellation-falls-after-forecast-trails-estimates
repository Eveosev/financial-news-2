Constellation Brands Inc., (STZ)  the
world’s largest wine company, sank the most in more than three
years after forecasting full-year profit that was less than
analysts estimated.  Constellation tumbled 12 percent to $21.63 at 10 a.m. in
 New York  and earlier fell as much as 13 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since Jan. 7, 2009. Before today, the shares
had climbed 19 percent this year.  Comparable earnings per share may be $1.93 to $2.03, the
Victor, New York-based maker of Simply Naked and Black Box wines
said today in a statement. Analysts projected profit of $2.23,
the average of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Chief Executive Officer Rob Sands is investing in
Constellation’s sales operations and promoting its brands. Sands
said today in the statement that those initiatives that may
temper profit growth while U.S. sales of wine and spirits will
grow in line with the market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
