China’s (IFB1)  stocks rose, driving the
benchmark index to the biggest advance in almost two months,
after the government said it will more than double the amount
foreigners can invest in equities, bonds and  bank deposits .  Citic Securities Co. jumped more than 5 percent, leading a
rally for brokerages, after the China Securities Regulatory
Commission increased quotas for qualified foreign institutional
investors to $80 billion from $30 billion. Suning Appliance Co.
and Kweichow Moutai Co. paced gains for consumer companies after
 Credit Agricole  CIB said borrowing costs will be cut this month.
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. added 3.7 percent after the 21st
Century Business Herald said the parent company plans to boost
investment in rare earth production in Guangxi province.  “Investors think the increase in QFII quotas will boost
blue-chip stocks in China, so shares are rising today,” said
Chen Liqiu, a strategist at Jianghai Securities Co. in Shanghai.
“In the mid-to-long term, such a policy will definitely spur
gains for Chinese equities.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 39.45 points, or 1.7
percent, to 2,302.24 at the close, the most since Feb. 8. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  climbed 2.4 percent to 2,512.83. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, dropped 1.7 percent to 101.89 yesterday in
 New York .  China accelerated the opening of its  capital markets  by
more than doubling the amount foreigners can invest in stocks,
bonds and bank deposits as the government shifts its growth
model to domestic consumption from exports. Offshore investors
will also be allowed to pump an extra 50 billion yuan ($7.9
billion) of local currency into the country, up from 20 billion
yuan, according to a  statement  on its website April 3.  Rate Outlook  Citic Securities, the biggest-listed brokerage, gained 5.8
percent to 12.26 yuan. Haitong Securities Co. rallied 7.8
percent to 9.71 yuan.  The regulator had granted a total of $24.6 billion in
quotas to 129 overseas companies since the program first started
in 2003 through the end of March. About 75 percent of assets
were invested in Chinese stocks, with the rest in bonds and
deposits, according to the statement.  The  Shanghai  index has dropped 6.4 percent from this year’s
high on March 2 on concern the world’s second-biggest economy is
stalling as the government’s property curbs and tight monetary
policies reduce profits. It’s still up 4.7 percent since Dec.
31. About 6.2 billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai
Composite on March 30, or 24 percent lower than the daily
average this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Thirty-day  volatility  on the gauge was at 17.5.  Consumer Stocks  China is “almost guaranteed” to either cut  interest rates 
or reserve requirement ratios in April, Dariusz Kowalczyk, a
Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole, said in a
Bloomberg television interview yesterday. The strategist cited
comments made by Premier  Wen Jiabao  on April 3 that he plans to
release fine-tuning measures “soon.”  The People’s Bank of  China  cut the amount lenders must keep
in reserve on Feb. 24 for the second time since December. China
hasn’t reduced interest rates since 2008. Investors speculated
the central bank may ease policies to boost the economy. China
trimmed the nation’s growth target to 7.5 percent from an 8
percent goal in place since 2005, a signal that leaders are
seeking to shift toward expansion driven more by domestic
consumption as against exports and  capital spending .  Gauges of consumer staples and discretionary companies rose
3.5 percent and 2.8 percent respectively in the CSI 300.
Kweichow Moutai, the biggest maker of baijiu liquor, surged 4.6
percent to 206 yuan, while Suning Appliance, China’s biggest
electronics retailer by market value, jumped 5.6 percent to
10.30 yuan.  Slowing Economy  Wen highlighted challenges facing his nation during a
provincial tour over April 1-3, saying some economic indicators
are slowing, according to a statement from the state-run Xinhua
News Agency on April 3.  Zhang Xiaoqiang , vice chairman of the National Development
and Reform Commission, said  China’s economy  may have expanded
about 8.4 percent in the first quarter, the least since the
first half of 2009. He spoke on April 3 during a panel
discussion at the Boao Forum for  Asia  and was citing “relevant
China research institutes’ initial figures” for the estimate.  The purchasing managers’ index for the services industry
was 53.3 last month, compared with 53.9 in February, according
to a statement issued by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
today. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  Chalco gained 3.7 percent to 6.81 yuan after 21st Century
Business Herald reported on April 2, without citing anyone, that
its parent plans to invest an additional 5.2 billion yuan in
rare earth production in the southern Guangxi province.  Bank ‘Monopoly’  China needs to break a banking “monopoly” of a few big
lenders that make easy profits because it’s hard to borrow money
elsewhere, Wen said. Earnings at China’s biggest banks are
growing even as a cooling economy triggers loan defaults.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the biggest
lender, slid 0.7 percent to 4.30 yuan, while largest rival  China
Construction Bank Corp. (939)  declined 0.8 percent to 4.79 yuan.  The  IShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., sank 1.5 percent to $36.63
yesterday, the steepest one-day drop in two weeks.  Stocks on the Shanghai Composite Index  trade  for 9.7 times
estimated earnings, compared with an average valuation of 23.8
times for equities in the  Bloomberg measure  for U.S.-traded
Chinese companies.  -- Editors: Allen Wan,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
