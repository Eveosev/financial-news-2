Kurdish President  Massoud Barzani 
said Iraq risks a return to dictatorship unless its ethnic and
political factions resolve their stalemate.  “I have called on all the Iraqi parties and groups to get
together and find a solution for this situation” so as not to
allow a dictatorship to develop, Barzani said today through an
interpreter at a policy group’s luncheon in Washington.  Barzani, who is heading home after meetings with President
 Barack Obama  and Vice President  Joe Biden , pledged to work
toward a solution within the terms of Iraq’s constitution.
Tension between the central government in Baghdad and the semi-
autonomous Kurdish region have increased as the U.S. seeks to
encourage a unified  Iraq  after withdrawing troops at the end of
December.  Should efforts to reach agreement fail, Barzani said he
would present the “realities” to the Kurdish people for their
decision. He didn’t specify whether the options would include
declaring full independence, a goal long sought by many Kurds.  Relations between the Kurds and the central government were
further strained on April 1 when the Kurdistan Regional
Government, which exports crude using a pipeline controlled by
Iraq, stopped deliveries. The Kurdish Ministry of Natural
Resources said Iraq failed to pay about $1.5 billion owed to oil
producers since May 2011.  Kurdistan will resume exports once Iraq pays “the
expenses” for those producers, Barzani said in his speech today
at the  Washington  Institute for Near East Policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
