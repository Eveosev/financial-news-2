Credit Agricole SA (ACA) ,  France ’s third-
largest lender, said its corporate- and investment-banking unit
aims to reach “medium-term” annual revenue of 5.4 billion
euros ($7 billion) as the firm trims its balance sheet.  Credit Agricole Group cut its funding needs by 31 billion
euros in the nine months through the end of March out of a
target of 50 billion euros for the end of 2012, according to a
presentation by Deputy Chief Executive Officer Jean-Yves Hocher
on the bank’s website. Most of the funding reductions were at
the corporate and investment bank.  The division, whose annual sales declined to 4.73 billion
euros in 2011 from 5.35 billion euros a year earlier, had
“first contacts” with investors including insurance firms to
share and sell new corporate loans, according to the
presentation. As part of its asset-cutting plan, Credit
Agricole’s corporate and investment bank in December announced
1,750 job cuts. The unit is also closing operations in 21
countries and is winding down its equity-derivatives business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
