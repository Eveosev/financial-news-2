The U.K. began a 20 million-pound
($32 million) funding program to support demonstration projects
for groups of wave and tidal power turbines.  Companies can bid for funding to test arrays of devices
that have already been demonstrated individually until June 1,
the Department for Energy and Climate Change said today in an e-
mailed  statement . The winners will be announced by year-end.  The U.K. estimates as much as 20 percent of current
electricity demand could be met from wave and tide power.
Companies including EON AG,  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and Vattenfall AB are
testing or plan to test wave-power devices, while  Siemens AG (SIE) 
owns tidal turbine developer Marine Current Turbines Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
