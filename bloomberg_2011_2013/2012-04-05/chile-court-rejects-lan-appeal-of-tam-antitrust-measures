Lan Airlines SA (LAN) , poised to become
the world’s biggest air carrier by market value after buying
Brazil’s  Tam SA (TAMM4) , had its appeal of antitrust conditions on the
transaction rejected by Chile’s top court.  In a ruling disclosed today, the Supreme Court backed
mitigation measures imposed by the country’s antitrust tribunal
in September, according to documents e-mailed by the judiciary.  “Without the imposed measures there is a real risk of
harming free competition,” the court said today in the ruling.  Lan, which said last month it expects to complete the $3.9
billion transaction in May, estimated that the mitigation
measures would imply a reduction of about $10 million in
expected annual savings. Lan had asked the Supreme Court to
overturn measures including code-sharing and stopover
restrictions.  Lan reiterated its intention to proceed with the
transaction in an e-mailed response to today’s ruling. Lan fell
1 percent to $28.74 in New York trading at 3:22 p.m. local time.
Tam slid 0.7 percent to 44.9 reais in Sao Paulo.  A Lan-Tam combination would have a market value of about
$14 billion, overtaking  Air China Ltd. (753)  and  Singapore Airlines
Ltd. (SIA)  as the world’s biggest airline, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
