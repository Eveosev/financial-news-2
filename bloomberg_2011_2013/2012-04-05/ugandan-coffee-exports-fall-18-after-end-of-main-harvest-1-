Coffee exports from  Uganda , Africa’s
second-biggest producer, fell 18 percent in March after the main
harvest ended in the country’s center and east.  Shipments from the continent’s biggest exporter of the
beans declined to 187,592 bags from 228,579 bags a year earlier,
preliminary estimates e-mailed today by the Uganda Coffee
Development Authority showed. Exports slid 23 percent from
February and were 6.2 percent below its 200,000-bag forecast,
the authority said, valuing the deliveries at about $30 million.  Uganda experienced a drought last year that affected crop
output and yields, according to the agriculture ministry.
National coffee exports in the year through September may rise
to 3.3 million bags from 3.15 million bags in 2010-11 as the
crop recovers, the authority said Oct. 10, without forecasting
production. Exports in 2010-11 were worth $449 million, it said.  Shipments from October through March, the sixth month of
the season, climbed 0.8 percent to 1.34 million bags from 1.33
million bags a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg tally of
the authority figures.  Uganda was  Africa ’s biggest coffee exporter and the world’s
ninth-largest in the 12 months through last September, according
to the London-based International Coffee Organization. Robusta
beans, used in espressos and instant drinks, account for about
85 percent of Ugandan production, according to the authority. A
bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
