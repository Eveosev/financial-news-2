The  Federal Reserve  approved a final
rule that would simplify so-called Regulation D, which focuses
on reserve requirements for banks.  The proposals are intended “to simplify the administration
of reserve requirements and reduce administrative and
operational costs for both  depository institutions  and  Federal
Reserve Banks (FDTR) ,” the Fed said today in a statement in
Washington.  The measure was approved by a 5-0 vote of the Fed’s Board
of Governors.  The rules would create a common two-week maintenance period
for all depository institutions, set up a “penalty-free band”
around reserve balance requirements and eliminate the
contractual clearing balance program, the central bank said in
its statement.  The Fed will also change the reference rate for computing
charges for overnight overdrafts from the effective federal
funds rate to the primary credit rate, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
