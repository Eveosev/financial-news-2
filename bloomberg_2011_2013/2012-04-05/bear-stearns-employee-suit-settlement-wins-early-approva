Former  Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC)  employees
won a judge’s preliminary approval of a $10 million settlement
of a group lawsuit over losses in their retirement accounts
related to the bank’s stock.  The settlement appears to be “fair, adequate and
reasonable,” U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet in  Manhattan  said
today in an order. He will hear any objections on Sept. 19
before deciding whether to give final approval, he said.  The settlement was reached on behalf of an estimated 8,400
former employees. It will resolve class-action lawsuits filed
beginning in 2008 against Bear Stearns and others. The
employees, participants and beneficiaries of Bear Stearns’s
employee stock ownership plan who held shares of the bank’s
common stock, claimed risky investments in subprime mortgages
caused them to lose money.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  bought Bear Stearns in March 2008 when
the firm was on the brink of failing.  The parties engaged in mediation in October 2009 and
pursued negotiations in telephone conferences through last year,
the investors said in court papers seeking approval for the
agreement. They said the settlement may equal 10 percent to
28 percent of the losses.  The case is In re Bear Stearns Cos. Securities, Derivative
and ERISA Litigation, 08-MDL-1963, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
