Former Swiss central bank president
Philipp Hildebrand took a 5.4 percent pay rise last year, the
central bank’s  annual report  showed.  Hildebrand, who left the  Swiss National Bank  in January
over a controversial currency purchase by his wife, earned 1.05
million Swiss francs ($1.15 million), including social security
contributions, up from 994,800 francs in 2010, the Zurich-based
 SNB (SNBN)  said in the report on its website today.  Vice President Thomas Jordan was also paid 1.05 million
francs, up from 993,700 francs. Board member Jean-Pierre Danthine’s salary fell to 1.11 million francs in 2011 from 1.37
million francs. His 2010 compensation included a one-time
pension plan buy-in as he joined the SNB that year.  Jordan is currently serving as interim chairman. Swiss
president Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf last week said Jordan “is
clearly a leading candidate” when the government names a new
central bank chief, probably this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
