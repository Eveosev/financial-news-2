The lira erased its gains after the
central bank offered lenders funding at the lowest end of
 Turkey â€™s rates corridor.  The lira traded less than 0.1 percent stronger at 1.7934
per dollar at 10:28 a.m. in Istanbul, compared with gains of as
much as 0.4 percent earlier today.  Yields (BENCH)  on two-year benchmark
bonds were unchanged at 9.38 percent.  The central bank offered 5 billion liras ($2.8 billion) at
5.75 percent in a one-week repo auction, providing less
expensive funding to lenders for a fifth day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
