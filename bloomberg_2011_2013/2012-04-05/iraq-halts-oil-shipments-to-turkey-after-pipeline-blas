Iraqi oil exports to  Turkey  were
halted after an explosion on the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline that
an official said was triggered by sabotage.  The cause of the blast, which occurred 59 kilometers (37
miles) inside Turkey in the southeastern province of Sirnak at
1:16 a.m., is being investigated, said a spokesman at the
country’s state-run pipeline company Botas. The pipeline was
sabotaged, said a deputy director of Iraq’s North Oil Co.  Turkish authorities extinguished the fire, the Botas
spokesman said today by telephone. Iraq and Turkey are
discussing using a smaller secondary pipeline to resume the oil
flow, according to Botas.  To contact the reporters on this story:
