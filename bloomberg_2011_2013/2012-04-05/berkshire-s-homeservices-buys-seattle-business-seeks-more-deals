Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s real
estate brokerage unit, HomeServices of America Inc., bought
Prudential Northwest Realty Associates as part of a strategy to
expand through acquisitions.  The deal for the Seattle-based business adds more than 350
sales associates in six offices, according to a  statement  today
from HomeServices, which didn’t disclose terms. The business
being acquired had more than $740 million in sales last year,
according to the statement.  HomeServices has been expanding as Berkshire Chief
Executive Officer Warren Buffett bets on a rebound in the U.S.
housing market. The Minneapolis-based unit said in February it
was adding Prudential Northwest Properties to expand in  Oregon .  “We are delighted to be in  Seattle ,” HomeServices CEO Ron Peltier said in the statement. “We continue to look for
additional opportunities, both here and throughout other major
markets in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
