Former  Dallas  Cowboys assistant
coach Joe Avezzano died today after a heart attack in Italy,
where he was coaching a team. He was 68.  The Cowboys’ special teams coach for three Super Bowl
titles, Avezzano was in his first year as head coach of the
 Italian Football League ’s  Seamen Milano , which announced his
death on its website.  “No one enjoyed life more than Joe, and no one that I know
had a greater appreciation for the people that he loved and the
lives that he touched,” Cowboys owner  Jerry Jones  said in a
statement. “He was an original. There was no one else like
him.”  Avezzano was an assistant in Dallas from 1990 to 2002, a
tenure that included eight playoff appearances and Super Bowl
titles following the 1992, 1993 and 1995 seasons.  In 2002, Avezzano was the inaugural head coach of the
Cowboys-owned Dallas Desperados of the Arena Football League,
according to the team’s website. He later coached with the
 Oakland Raiders  before moving to Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
