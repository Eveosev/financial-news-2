OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, rose for the first day in five as the company proposed a
dividend and European stocks rebounded from a one-month low.  The shares advanced 0.9 percent to 3,765 forint by 10:33
a.m. in Budapest. OTP proposed a dividend at 100 percent of the
face value of shares for the 2011 fiscal year, with the exact
payment to be calculated after taking into account the
proportion of treasury shares, the bank said in a statement to
the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  The dividend is higher than the 92 forint that had been
 expected  by investors, Peter Deaki and Gergely Palffy, Budapest-
based analysts with Buda-Cash Brokerhaz Zrt., wrote in a
research report today.  “We see a slight rebound in the shares,”  Akos Kuti , an
analyst at Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., another Budapest-based
broker, wrote in a report on the dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
