Canada’s  Gabriel Resources Ltd. (GBU)  said
the permit-application process for its Rosia Montana gold mine
in Romania shouldn’t be delayed after a court ruling that
annulled a zoning plan.  Rosia Montana Gold Corp., majority-owned by Gabriel
Resources, needs an environmental permit to start work at the
mine. There is no connection between the Alba Iulia court ruling
and the permit process, Andreea Nastase, a spokeswoman, said in
a phone interview today.  “We understand that the ruling refers to a zoning plan
adopted in 2009,” Nastase said. An earlier zoning plan dating
back to 2002 is “valid and in force.”  The Alba Iulia Court of Appeal yesterday ruled in favor of
non-profit organizations that said some local-council members
who voted for the mine’s zoning plans in 2009 had a conflict of
interest because some of their family members were employed by
the mining company, said Marius Liviu Harosa, a lawyer who
represented the organizations.  Gabriel  plunged  17 percent to C$3.84 at 3:13 p.m. in
Toronto. The Whitehorse, Yukon-based company earlier fell as
much as 21 percent, the most intraday since July 2009.  Romania ’s government said it hasn’t received any documents
related to the Rosia Montana project from the court, Dan Suciu,
the cabinet’s spokesman, said by phone.  Alburnus Maior and Rosia Montana Cultural Foundation, non-
profit organizations challenging the zoning plans, oppose the
mining project, because of environmental issues caused by the
use of cyanide in extracting the gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
