The Spanish trio of  Atletico Madrid ,
 Athletic Bilbao  and Valencia advanced to the Europa League
soccer semifinals, where they’ll be joined by Portugal’s
Sporting Lisbon.  Radamel Falcao scored in the 87th minute as Atletico Madrid
won at Hannover 2-1 last night for a 4-2 victory in the two-
match quarterfinal. Adrian Lopez also scored for Atletico, which
won Europe’s second-tier club competition in 2010, and Mame
Diouf had the Hannover goal.  Valencia routed AZ Alkmaar 4-0 to overturn a 2-1 deficit
from the first game in the Netherlands. Adil Rami scored twice
in the opening 17 minutes, with Jordi Alba and Pablo Hernandez
adding goals in the second half.  Athletic Bilbao advanced by a 6-4 aggregate following its
2-2 home draw with Schalke. Ibai Gomez and Markel Susaeta had
the Bilbao goals, while Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his
competition-best 10th goal for Schalke and  Raul Gonzalez  netted
his record-extending 77th goal in European competition.  Rui Patricio saved Cleiton Xavier’s second-half penalty
kick as Sporting Lisbon tied Metalist Kharkiv 1-1 in Ukraine to
advance by a 3-2 aggregate. Ricky van Wolfswinkel scored for
Sporting and Jonathan Cristaldo had the Metalist goal.  Atletico will meet Valencia and Bilbao will play Sporting
in the two-match semifinals on April 19 and 26, with the winners
moving into the May 9 final in Bucharest.  Three teams from the same country are in the final four for
the second straight time after Portugal’s Porto, Braga and
Benfica reached the semifinals last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
