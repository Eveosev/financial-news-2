Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) ,  Africa ’s biggest
producer of the building material, said it will raise output to
46.3 million metric tons by 2015.  The company’s output in Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s
second-largest economy, will advance to 32 million tons by 2015
from 20 million tons this year, Lagos-based Dangote said in an
e-mailed presentation today.  Dangote Cement will produce 1.5 million tons from its plant
in Senegal this year, bringing total output in 2012 to 21.5
million tons, it said. The company has also signed a memorandum
of understanding for the construction of a cement plant in
Calabar, Nigeria’s southeastern seaport, with a capacity of 3
million tons by 2015, it added.  Dangote Cement is the biggest company traded on the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  with a market value of 1.81 trillion
naira ($11.5 billion). The company’s parent, Dangote Industries
Ltd., has a 64 percent stake in  Sephaku Holdings Ltd. (SEP) , a South
African mineral exploration and development company that also
produces cement. The company said last April that its total
annual production capacity should reach 50 million tons in five
years.  Dangote Cement shares gained a second day, rising by 60
kobo, or 0.5 percent, to 116.60 naira and traded at 116.50 naira
by 2:21 p.m. in Lagos, heading for the highest close since Jan.
