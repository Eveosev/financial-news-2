U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its biggest weekly drop of the
year, as renewed concern about Europe’s debt crisis overshadowed
a drop in jobless claims to a four-year low.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  and  General Electric Co. (GE)  fell more than 1.3
percent for the biggest drops in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average .  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ)   lost 12 percent, the most in
the  S&P 500 , after the company forecast earnings that missed
projections.  Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  rose 2.2 percent as the price
of oil climbed for the first time in three days.  Bed Bath &
Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  added 8.5 percent, leading consumer discretionary
stocks higher, as the retailer’s profit beat estimates.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.1 percent to 1,398.08 at 4 p.m. New
York time. The Dow fell 14.61 points, or 0.1 percent, to
13,060.14. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. stock
exchanges today, 15 percent below the three-month average.  “You have, certainly, improvement in the labor market in
the U.S. but every once in a while we got reminded there still
remain problems in Europe,” Greg Woodard, a portfolio
strategist at Manning & Napier in Fairport,  New York , which
manages about $40 billion, said in a telephone interview. “The
volatility is going to continue. It’s going to be choppy. The
trend seems to be improvement in the U.S. and continued
difficulties outside the U.S.”  The S&P 500  retreated  0.7 percent this week after reaching
an almost four-year high on April 2, as demand fell at a Spanish
bond auction and minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s latest
policy meeting damped expectations for more monetary stimulus.
The gauge has still  rallied 11 percent  this year as U.S.
economic reports surpassed estimates and investors speculated
the euro-area’s sovereign debt crisis will be contained.  Jobs Data  Equities trimmed early losses after Labor Department data
showed  unemployment claims  in the U.S. fell 6,000 to 357,000 in
the week ended March 31, the fewest since April 2008. The median
forecast of 43 economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated a
decrease to 355,000. The number of people on unemployment
benefit rolls also dropped, while those getting extended
payments increased.  A report tomorrow may show the economy added more than
200,000 jobs in March for a fourth consecutive month, the
longest streak of similar increases since late 1999 to early
2000. While U.S. stock exchanges are closed tomorrow for Good
Friday, index futures will trade for 45 minutes following the
Labor Department’s monthly jobs report.  Stocks fell earlier as Spanish bonds declined for a third
day today, pushing the spread between yields on 10-year Spanish
and German debt to more than 400 basis points for the first time
since Dec. 12.  ‘Take Risk Off’  The S&P 500 may fall as much as 7 percent because of
economic weakness in  Europe , according to hedge fund manager
 Barton Biggs .  “I may want to take a little risk off,” Biggs, founder of
Traxis Partners LP, said on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop” with Betty Liu. “I am cutting back a little, and I’m
tempted to cut back some more,” he said. Equities are “going
higher over the course of the next few months, but in the short
run here we’ll have a little pause.”  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index lost 0.4 percent. Alcoa
declined 1.8 percent to $9.63, while General Electric erased 1.3
percent to $19.49.  Constellation Brands plunged 12 percent to $21.61. The
world’s largest wine company said earnings per share for the
full year may be $1.93 to $2.03. Analysts projected profit of
$2.23, the average of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Polycom Inc. (PLCM) , a maker of videoconferencing equipment,
slumped 20 percent to $14.56 after saying preliminary first-
quarter earnings and revenue fell short of analysts’
expectations.  Cabot Oil & Gas rose 2.2 percent to $31.94 as the price of
crude oil rose 1.6 percent.  Consumer discretionary stocks had the biggest gain in the
S&P 500, led by Bed Bath & Beyond. The retail-chain operator
rose 8.5 percent to $71.85 as the company posted a fourth-
quarter profit of $1.48 a share, beating the average analyst
estimate of $1.32.  To contact the reporters on this story:
