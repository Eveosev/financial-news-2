Cooking-oil imports by India, the
world’s biggest  palm oil  buyer, probably more than doubled in
March as high domestic prices and speculation that taxes will be
increased in the annual budget spurred buying.  Purchases climbed to 900,000 metric tons from 435,735 tons
a year earlier, according to the median estimate of five
processors and brokers surveyed by Bloomberg News. Imports of
crude and refined palm oil surged to 650,000 tons from 253,727
tons, the survey showed.  The Solvent Extractors’ Association of
India  is scheduled to release the data on April 13.  The increase in Indian imports for a second month may help
palm oil in  Kuala Lumpur  extend a rally from the highest price
in more than a year, boosting profits for producers including
 Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  Futures rallied 12 percent this year on concern
that global cooking-oil supplies may decline as drought curbs
soybean output in Brazil and  Argentina .  “The main reason for the increase in imports is that our
local crops have not been very good,” said Sandeep Bajoria,
chief executive officer of Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based
commodities trader. “The rapeseed crop is lower and local
prices are higher than the global prices.”  India’s oilseeds production may drop to 30.5 million tons
in the year ending June 30 from 32.48 million tons a year
earlier, according to India’s farm ministry. That may boost
vegetable-oil imports as much as 9.5 million tons in the year
ending Oct. 31, he said. The country bought 8.7 million tons
last year, according to the extractors’ association.  Malaysia, Indonesia  Purchases may average 850,000 tons to 950,000 tons a month
until October, Bajoria said. Imports increased 59 percent in
February to 875,649 tons, the extractors’ association said on
March 14. Imports of palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia make
up almost 80 percent of  India ’s cooking-oil purchases.  Palm oil for June delivery ended the morning session little
changed at 3,560 ringgit ($1,162) per ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange. Futures rose 5 percent in March, touching
3,574 ringgit yesterday, the highest price since March 2011.  “Imports of edible oil are rising as crushing has been low
in India because the price on commodity exchanges is much higher
than the spot prices,” said Atul Chaturvedi, chief executive
officer of Adani Wilmar Ltd.  India barred commodity exchanges from offering new
contracts in soybeans to curb speculation after futures had the
biggest monthly gain in more than three years in March. Futures
jumped 24 percent on the National Commodity & Derivatives
Exchange Ltd. in Mumbai this year, more than the 18 percent gain
in  Chicago .  Tax Concerns  Imports were also fueled by concerns that the government
may raise taxes, Ashok Sethia,  executive director  at Sethia Oils
Ltd., said by phone from Kolkata. Finance Minister  Pranab
Mukherjee  left the import duty on refined oils unchanged at 7.5
percent in his annual budget speech on March 16.  Refined cooking oils bought overseas were about $30 a ton
cheaper than domestic supplies, Sunvin’s Bajoria said.  Soybean oil imports rose to 150,000 tons in March from
81,131 tons a year earlier, while sunflower oil purchases
climbed to 100,000 tons from 76,230 tons, the survey showed.
Stockpiles at Indian ports fell to about 650,000 tons as of
April 1 from about 840,000 tons in March, Bajoria said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
