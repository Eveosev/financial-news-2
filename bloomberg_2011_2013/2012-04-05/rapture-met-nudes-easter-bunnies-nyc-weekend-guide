Get your dance pants on Friday night
when the Rapture rolls into  Bowery Ballroom  with their latest
album, “In The Grace Of Your Love.”  Part of the early 2000s dance-punk new garde, the Rapture

Traviata” returns to the  Metropolitan Opera  on Friday.  With its huge clock reflecting the ebbing life of the

ill at the dress rehearsal. Another draw: classy Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Germont pere.  Runs through May 2 at Lincoln Center. Information: +1-212-

skin -- nude women caught by the camera lens.  Beginning with the erotic early days in  France , the show at

history of the unclothed human body.  Among the images:  Robert Mapplethorpe ’s shot of his friend

cherry trees. It’s the perfect time for a pilgrimage to the
Cloisters, the Met’s uptown branch devoted to all things
medieval.  Today at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. early music group Pomerium sings
Renaissance Easter music.  Don’t miss the exhibition of ivory chessmen from the Isle
of Lewis, each piece carved into a distinct character -- a
magnificently bearded king, knights riding shaggy ponies and
eager “berserkers” or soldiers of Odin.  At 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park. Information:

with two Soprano-style bosses -- is a bit hit in  London .  Directed by  Nicholas Hytner  for National Theatre, the play
has now hit Broadway with James Corden as the confused hero who
