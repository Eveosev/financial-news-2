Soybeans advanced, rising for the
second week, on speculation that smaller South American harvests
will spur demand for U.S. inventories. Corn gained.  Brazil ’s soybean  crop  may fall to 66 million metric tons,
below the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s official forecast of
68.5 million and 75.5 million harvested last year, the USDA’s
Foreign Agricultural Service said in a  report  yesterday. In the
week ending March 29, U.S. exporters sold 1.11 million tons of
soybeans, up 88 percent from a week earlier, USDA data show.  “The market is still adjusting to shrinking crops in
Brazil,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in
Fowler,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “Export sales
show a global shift to buying more U.S. soybeans.”  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 1 percent to close at
$14.34 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
oilseed advanced 2.2 percent this week. Earlier, the price
matched the April 3 peak at $14.3425, the highest for a most-
active contract since Sept. 7. The commodity has gained 19
percent this year after hot, dry weather cut yields in Brazil
and Argentina, the world’s biggest growers after the U.S.  Corn futures for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$6.5825 a bushel in Chicago. The prices increased 2.2 percent
this week, snapping a two-week decline. The CBOT will be closed
tomorrow for a public holiday.  The U.S. was the biggest exporter of both crops in the year
that ended Aug. 31. Corn is the largest, valued at $76.5 billion
in 2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government
figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
