Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer  James Gorman ’s compensation for 2011 totaled $10.5
million, a 25 percent cut from 2010 as the firm’s shares fell by
almost half.  Gorman, 53, got $5.04 million in restricted shares, and
$1.94 million in shares tied to company performance, according
to a proxy filing today from the New York-based investment bank.
He also received a deferred cash bonus of $2.72 million that can
be clawed back, in addition to his $800,000 salary. He didn’t
receive an immediate cash bonus.  The package trailed the $23 million that  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  awarded CEO  Jamie Dimon , 56, and the $15 million that
Citigroup Inc. granted CEO  Vikram Pandit , 55. Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world’s largest brokerage,  fell  44 percent last
year in New York trading as the firm posted a 4 percent return
on equity, below Gorman’s goal of “mid-teens.”  Morgan Stanley (MS)  cut 2011 pay for senior investment bankers
and traders by an average of 20 percent to 30 percent and capped
immediate cash bonuses at $125,000, according to people briefed
on the plans. Total compensation for each member of the firm’s
operating committee fell at least 20 percent, and all members
won’t receive an immediate cash bonus, one of the people said.  Profit  fell  13 percent last year to $4.11 billion. While
Morgan Stanley posted the only trading revenue increase among
the major U.S. banks, excluding accounting gains, the firm had
per-share losses in two of the past three quarters as it took
charges to eliminate swap contracts purchased from  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and
to convert Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.’s preferred stake
to common shares.  Shares have risen 24 percent so far this year as analysts
estimated trading revenue will rebound from the second half of
last year and equity markets climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
