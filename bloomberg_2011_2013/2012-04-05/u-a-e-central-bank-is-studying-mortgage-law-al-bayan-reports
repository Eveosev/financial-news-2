The United Arab Emirates central
bank is considering a mortgage law that would stipulate real-
estate records, guarantees and a dispute resolution mechanism,
 Al Bayan  reported, citing Central Bank governor Sultan Bin Nasser Al-Suwaidi.  The aim of the law is to encourage banks to accept homes as
preferred collateral for debt, the newspaper cited the  governor
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
