Belarus may redeploy its ambassador
to  Poland  and representative to the European Union, Belta
 reported , citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrey Savinykh.  Belarus recalled the two diplomats in February after the EU
widened sanctions against the former Soviet republic and all
members of the 27-nation bloc summoned their ambassadors from
Belarus for consultations.  The EU widened its list of Belarussian individuals banned
to enter the trading bloc to more than 240 people and froze
assets of 32 Belarus-based companies in January. The European
Parliament has called to rid Belarus of hosting the 2014 World
Hockey Championship, citing a deteriorating political situation
and human rights abuses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
