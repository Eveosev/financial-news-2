Gasoline headed for its first weekly
drop in two months as stockpiles of the motor fuel in northwest
 Europe  reached a two-month high, increasing the supply available
for export.  Futures sank 0.5 percent as gasoline stockpiles in
independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp, Europe’s
oil-trading hub, rose to the highest level since Feb. 2,
according to PJK International BV. Inventories along the U.S.
East Coast rose 165,000 barrels last week as imports jumped 53
percent, the Energy Department reported yesterday. Demand over
the past four weeks was 3.8 percent below a year earlier.  “We’re seeing rises in supply coincident with continued
declines in gasoline demand,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery declined 1.72 cents to $3.3164 a
gallon at 12:53 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have risen 23 percent this year, the best-performing contract in
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.  Europe’s ARA inventories climbed 24 percent to 804,000
metric tons in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher
in the Netherlands. U.S. stockpiles on the East Coast are at the
highest level for this  time of year  since 2008, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. demand for the motor fuel fell 3.5 percent from a year
earlier, according to MasterCard’s April 3 SpendingPulse report.  May-delivery heating oil gained 0.21 cent to $3.163 a
gallon on the Nymex. Prices have advanced 7.8 percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.8
cent yesterday to $3.936, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest
motoring club. Prices have gained 20 percent this year, and are
6.8 percent above a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
