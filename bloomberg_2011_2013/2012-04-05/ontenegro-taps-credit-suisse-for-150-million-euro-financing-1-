Montenegro will borrow 150 million
euros ($196 million) from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  through a
direct placement of euro bonds, the Balkan nation’s  Finance
Ministry  said.  The bonds will have a maturity of five years, including a
two-year grace period, with the cost of borrowing was set at 6.5
percent above the 12-month EURIBOR, the ministry in Podgorica
said today in a statement.  Montenegro needs to borrow 230 million euros this year to
finance its  budget deficit , repay debts and “create fiscal
reserves,” the ministry said. The direct borrowing was chosen
after the government “faced extremely aggravated and
unfavorable borrowing conditions in international financial
markets,” it added.  The smallest of six ex-Yugoslav republics will use the
funds to repay 52 million euros in old debt to Credit Suisse,
leaving it with an increase in public debt to 48.1 percent of
economic output, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
