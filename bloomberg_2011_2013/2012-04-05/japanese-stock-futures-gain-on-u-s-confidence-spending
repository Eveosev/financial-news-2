Japanese  stocks  declined a third day
after falling demand for Spanish bonds refocused attention on
 Europe ’s debt crisis. Shares pared losses after a nominee to the
Bank of Japan was rejected as lawmakers press for a candidate
more supportive of aggressive easing.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets almost a fifth of
its revenue from Europe, lost 1 percent after paring losses of
as much as 3.2 percent.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s top energy explorer
by market value, sank 1.3 percent after crude prices declined.
Gulliver International Co. dropped 2.5 percent after the used-
car seller said profit will fall.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  fell 0.5 percent to 9,767.61
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, extending losses after yesterday
plunging by the most since Nov. 10. The gauge pared earlier
losses of as much as 1.3 percent. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost
0.3 percent to 832.57, with twice as many shares declining as
advancing.  “The fact that investors were so unenthusiastic about
Spain’s auction reminded people that Europe has made very little
real progress in solving its debt problems,” said Hisakazu
Amano, who helps oversee　the equivalent of $24 billion at T&D
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.3
percent today. The gauge sank 1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
this year’s second-biggest decline, as a measure of U.S. service
industries dropped.  Spain struggled to borrow in financial markets, selling 2.6
billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds at an auction. The amount
was near the bottom of a range set for the sale, raising concern
that Europe is still struggling to contain its debt crisis.  “Spain is facing an economic situation of extreme
difficulty, I repeat, of extreme difficulty, and anyone who
doesn’t understand that is fooling themselves,” Spanish Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said as he seeks to push through the
deepest budget cuts in three decades.  Exporters Fall  Nissan,  Japan ’s second-largest carmaker by revenue, lost 1
percent to 869 yen. Ricoh Co., an office-equipment and camera
maker that gets more than a fifth of its sales in Europe,
slipped 1.4 percent to 792 yen.  The euro depreciated to as low as 107.91 against the yen
last night in Tokyo, compared with 109.04 yen at the close of
 stock trading  yesterday. The dollar also weakened to 82.10 yen
from 82.62 yen, cutting the value of some overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Stocks pared after BNP Paribas SA economist  Ryutaro Kono ,
Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda’s nominee to the Bank of Japan
board, was blocked by a vote in the upper house of parliament.  ‘Negative on Easing’  “People in the market think it would be best to have a
monetarist in that position,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a　 fund
manager  who helps oversee $2 billion at Tokyo-based Bayview
Asset Management Co. Kono “was negative on BOJ’s monetary
easing stance.”  The  Topix (TPX)  has risen about 5.8 percent since Feb. 14, when
the  Bank of Japan  increased its government-bond purchases,
weakening the yen. The gain has boosted the  value  of stocks
listed on the gauge to 1.02 times book value, up from 0.88 in
December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A number
below one means companies can be bought for less than value of
their assets.  Commodity prices declined, with crude for May delivery
sinking 2.4 percent to $101.47 a barrel in New York yesterday,
the lowest since Feb. 14. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial commodities including copper and
aluminum dropped 2.7 percent to the lowest level since Jan. 16.  Energy Stocks Decline  Inpex slid 1.3 percent to 543,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer by
market value, lost 1.2 percent to 3,705 yen. Sumitomo Metal
Mining Co., a producer of copper and other non-ferrous metals,
fell 1.2 percent to 1,115 yen.  Gulliver (7599)  sank 2.5 percent to 3,145 yen after the used-car
retailer said it expects a 26 percent drop in net income to 2.8
billion yen ($34 million) in the year through February 2013,
citing uncertainty about vehicle auction markets.  Among stocks that rose, Showa Denko K.K. gained the most in
the Nikkei 225, rising 3.8 percent to 190 yen. The company will
supply hard disks to Seagate Technology Plc, according to the
Nikkei newspaper.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. climbed 1.9 percent to 210 yen
after the Nikkei reported the government will buy a majority
stake in the owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
power plant.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in  Tokyo . Editors: Jim Powell, Jason Clenfield  To contact the reporter on this story:
