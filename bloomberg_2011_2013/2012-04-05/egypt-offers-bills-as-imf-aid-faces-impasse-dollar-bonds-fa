Egypt plans to sell 5.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($911 million) of bills today as an impasse
between the government and parliament risks derailing loan talks
with the  International Monetary Fund . The dollar bonds declined.  The North African country will seek bids for six- and 12-
month notes valued at 2 billion pounds and 3.5 billion pounds,
respectively, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
government paid average yields of 14.829 percent on the  six-
month bills  and 15.709 percent on the  one-year securities  at an
auction last week.  The Freedom and Justice Party may reject a proposed $3.2
billion loan from the IMF when it is presented before parliament
because the government hasnâ€™t answered questions about the
financing, Ashraf Badreldin, a legislator with the biggest
parliamentary bloc, said yesterday. The comments come after
state-owned  Al Ahram  reported Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed
as saying  Egypt  may sign a letter of intent with the IMF this
month for the loan.  Domestic debt yields have leveled-off after soaring to
record highs. Average yields on  one-year notes  jumped 512 basis
points since the popular uprising in January 2011 to 15.709
percent at the March 29 sale. The yield reached 15.975 percent
on Feb. 14, the highest level since Bloomberg started tracking
the data in 2006. Foreign reserves fell for a 15th month in
March to $15.1 billion, the lowest level in more than seven
years.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020
gained one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.65
percent, the highest in almost a month, at 11:28 a.m. in Cairo,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound
was little changed at 6.0360 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
