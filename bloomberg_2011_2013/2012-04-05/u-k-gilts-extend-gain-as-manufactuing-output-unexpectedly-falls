U.K. government bonds extended their
gains after a report showed manufacturing output unexpectedly
declined in February for a second month.  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.19 percent at 9:41 a.m.  London  time.
Two-year yields were little changed at 0.43 percent.  Factory output fell 1 percent from January, the most since
April, the  Office for National Statistics  said today in London.
The median forecast of 24 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
was for an increase of 0.1 percent. Manufacturing, which
accounts for 10 percent of the economy, was revised to a 0.3
percent decline in January from a 0.1 percent increase.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.5870 and was little
changed at 82.73 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
