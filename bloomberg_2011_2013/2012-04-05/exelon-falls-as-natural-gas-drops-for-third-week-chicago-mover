Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S.
nuclear plant owner, fell to the lowest in 21 months as natural-
gas prices dropped for a third straight week.  Exelon decreased 1.3 percent to $38.37 at the close in New
York, its lowest since July 6, 2010.  Natural-gas (UNG)  futures
declined 5.2 cents to $2.089 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement price
since Jan. 30, 2002.  Power producers such as Chicago-based Exelon have seen
margins squeezed because of lower demand for electricity and a
glut of gas, said  Paul Patterson , a New York-based electric
power analyst with Glenrock Associates.  “Without a rebound in the economy, that sector is going to
face a lower bottom line,” Patterson said in a phone interview.  Exelon has fallen 5.8 percent since the start of 2011,
while the S&P 500 Utilities Index, which includes regulated
utilities, gained 11.8 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Exelon is “is well-positioned for the future” following
its merger with  Constellation Energy Group Inc. (CEG) , which closed
March 9, Judith Rader, an Exelon spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
