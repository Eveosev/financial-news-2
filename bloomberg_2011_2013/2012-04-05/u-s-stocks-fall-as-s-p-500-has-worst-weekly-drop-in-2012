U.S. stocks  slid this week, giving
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index its biggest decline of the year,
after the  Federal Reserve  signaled it will refrain from further
monetary stimulus and concern about  Europe  intensified.  Nine out of 10 S&P 500 industries retreated during the
holiday-shortened week. Energy companies fell the most as  Alpha
Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  slumped 6.6 percent, leading the group to
a 1.8 percent drop.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  and  Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ) 
tumbled at least 8.4 percent after providing disappointing
forecasts. Apple Inc. jumped 5.7 percent, helping drive
technology companies in the benchmark index to the longest
string of weekly gains since at least 1989.  The S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent for the week to 1,398.08,
after reaching the highest level since May 2008 on April 2. The
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost 151.90 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 13,060.14. While U.S. stocks markets are closed today for
Good Friday, futures on the two indexes will trade for 45
minutes after the Labor Department’s monthly jobs report comes
out at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  “The Fed is taking QE3 a little bit off the table,”
 Jeffrey Kleintop , chief market strategist at LPL Financial Corp.
in Boston, which oversees $350 billion, said in a telephone
interview, referring to a third round of stimulus measures known
as quantitative easing. “The market knows how the movie ends.
It has seen it twice before and is worried we’re on the cusp of
a 15 to 20 percent pullback.”  First Quarter  Equities failed to build on the  S&P 500 (SPX) ’s best first-
quarter rally since 1998. Minutes from the March 13 meeting of
the Federal Open Market Committee showed that the central bank
will refrain from increasing monetary accommodation unless
economic expansion falters or prices rise at a rate slower than
its 2 percent target. Concern about Europe’s debt crisis
intensified as  Spain  sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of
bonds at an auction, less than the maximum target of 3.5 billion
euros.  The S&P 500 surged 12 percent from January through March as
data on manufacturing, real estate and the labor market boosted
optimism about the world’s largest economy. Reports this week
showed manufacturing in the U.S. expanded at a faster pace than
forecast while jobless claims dropped to the lowest level in
four years. The Labor Department report today is projected by
economists to show the nation added more than 200,000 jobs for a
fourth straight month.  Energy shares  in the  S&P 500  declined 1.8 percent for the
third consecutive weekly retreat, the longest streak since
August.  Alpha Natural , a coal producer, fell 6.6 percent to
$14.20. Nabors Industries Ltd., the world’s largest land-rig
contractor, decreased 5.1 percent to $16.60.  SanDisk Tumbles  SanDisk tumbled 11 percent to $44.09. The biggest maker of
flash-memory cards predicted revenue in the quarter that ended
April 1 of about $1.2 billion. That compared with an earlier
forecast for sales of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion. SanDisk
cited weaker-than-expected pricing and demand for components
that store data in mobile phones.  The S&P 500 Information Technology Index added 0.1 percent,
gaining for a 14th straight week, the longest streak since at
least September 1989. Apple, the world’s biggest company by
market value, advanced 5.7 percent to a record $633.68 after its
new iPad was named the best tablet computer in a ranking by
Consumer Reports.  Analysts (AAPL)  from Piper Jaffray Cos. and Topeka
Capital Markets said the stock could surge to $1,000.  Constellation Brands slipped 8.4 percent to $21.61. The
world’s largest wine company said full-year earnings per share
may be $1.93 to $2.03. Analysts projected profit of $2.23, on
average, in a Bloomberg survey.  ‘Heightened Risk’  General Electric Co. (GE) , the maker of jet engines, power
generation equipment, health-care imaging equipment and
locomotives, fell 2.9 percent to $19.49. Moody’s Investors
Service cut GE’s credit rating by one level and reduced GE
Capital Corp. by two steps, citing “heightened risk” from the
finance unit.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  fell the most in the S&P 500, sinking 16
percent to $20.98. The biggest maker of thin-film solar panels
had its share-price estimate lowered to $20 from $35 by JPMorgan
Chase & Co., which said the company’s profit margin will
continue to decline.  Avon Products Inc. (AVP)  surged 21 percent, the most since 1998,
to $23.42. Coty Inc., the seller of perfumes by Heidi Klum and
Beyonce Knowles, offered to buy the cosmetics company for about
$10 billion. Avon rejected the bid, saying a deal wouldn’t be in
the best interests of shareholders.  Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY)  rose 9.2 percent to $71.85. The
retail-chain operator posted a fourth-quarter profit of $1.48 a
share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.32.  Near Zero  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has kept  interest rates  near
zero since December 2008 and expanded the central bank’s balance
sheet with two rounds of asset purchases totaling $2.3 trillion.
First-quarter rallies in the S&P 500 stalled in April in both of
the past two years, sinking as much as 16 percent in 2010 and 19
percent in 2011, amid concern the Fed would stop stimulating the
economy.  “One of the very stated reasons why the Fed has unleashed
all this easing through QE1 and QE2 is to attempt to juice the
stock market to boost the wealth effect,” Liz Ann Sonders,
chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., told Ken
Prewitt and  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Radio’s “Bloomberg
Surveillance.” “Now that it looks like we are not going to get
QE3, we are now going through the digestion phase of figuring
out how much of the support under the economy or the market was
a function of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
