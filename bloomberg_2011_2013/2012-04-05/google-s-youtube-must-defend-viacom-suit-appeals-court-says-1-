Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube video-sharing
website must defend itself against claims that it violated
 Viacom Inc. (VIAB) ’s copyrights by letting users post clips from shows
including “The Colbert Report” without authorization, an
appeals court ruled.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in  Manhattan  today reversed a
lower court’s decision to throw out the case before trial. The
lower-court judge had said YouTube was protected from liability
because it removed infringing videos when notified.  “A reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual
knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its
website,” a two-judge panel said in a 39-page decision.  Viacom sued in 2007, seeking $1 billion in damages and
claiming that  YouTube  users were illegally uploading thousands
of videos of Viacom television programs, such as “ South Park ”
and “The  Daily Show  With  Jon Stewart ,” and movies from its
Paramount Pictures studio.  “The court delivered a definitive, common sense message --
intentionally ignoring theft is not protected by the law,”
Jeremy Zweig, a Viacom spokesman, said in an e-mail.  U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton ruled in 2010 that
YouTube was protected from liability by the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act because it removed the offending videos when told
they had been posted. New York-based Viacom appealed, saying
YouTube was aware of the copyright violation when it displayed
the videos without authorization.  Google, based in  Mountain View ,  California , fell $3.39 to
$631.76 at 2:20 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. Viacom Class B shares rose 2 percent, to $47.34.  ‘Knowledge or Awareness’  The appeals panel agreed with Stanton that the DMCA
requires online service providers to have “knowledge or
awareness of specific infringing activity” before being held
liable for copyright infringement.  Stanton erred by granting summary judgment to YouTube on
the alleged facts of the case and in interpreting a provision of
the law, the appeals court said. While returning the case to the
lower court for more “fact-finding,” the appeals judges also
said that three of YouTube’s software functions were protected
under the law. A fourth function, involving the syndication of
videos to third parties, will be subject to more fact-finding,
the justices said.  ‘Tiny Percentage’  “All that is left of the Viacom lawsuit that began as a
wholesale attack on YouTube is a dispute over a tiny percentage
of videos long ago removed from YouTube,” Google said in an e-
mailed statement. “Nothing in this decision impacts the way
YouTube is operating.”  In court, Viacom argued that YouTube used unauthorized
copyrighted material to draw visitors and make the website more
attractive to potential buyers. The site benefited financially
from infringement by reaping  revenue  from advertisements placed
next to the videos, Viacom said.  Paul Smith , a lawyer for Viacom, said in a telephone
interview that the video clips at issue were “the stuff
everybody was going to watch. It was a clear draw to the site
when they were trying to build their business.” He said the
case could eventually be tried by a jury.  Garth Brooks  The case has attracted wide attention. More than 125 so-
called friend-of-the-court briefs supporting either Google or
Viacom were filed by parties including the  Associated Press , the
Songwriters Guild of America, musicians Garth Brooks and Sting,
Microsoft Corp., the  Consumer Electronics Association , EBay
Inc., Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.  Google, operator of the world’s biggest Internet search
engine,  bought  YouTube in 2006 for $1.65 billion. Google said in
a filing that Viacom had also been interested in buying the
site.  After Google made its successful offer, Viacom sent the
“takedown” notices required by law when a content provider
wants infringing material removed from a site, Google said.
Viacom said YouTube offered it a partnership agreement valued at
$590 million before talks ended.  Google also said Viacom uploaded its own videos to YouTube
to promote its programs. The website operator said Viacom
couldn’t tell which videos were unauthorized and which weren’t.  YouTube was founded in 2005 by Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and
Jawed Karim, who all had worked at the Internet payment provider
PayPal, now part of EBay. When it started, YouTube displayed
mostly homemade videos uploaded for free and viewed by other
visitors. YouTube is now an aggregator of audio and video from
major entertainment, media and sports companies.  The Football Association Premier League Ltd., a U.K. soccer
organization, and some music publishers also sued YouTube and
appealed the lower-court ruling.  The case is Viacom International v. YouTube, 10-03270,  U.S.
Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-
court case is Viacom v. YouTube, 07-2103, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
