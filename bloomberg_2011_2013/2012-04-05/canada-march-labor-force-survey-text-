Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was up 1.1% or
197,000. Almost all of this growth was in full-time employment,
up 181,000 (+1.3%), while part-time employment edged up. The
total number of hours worked rose 1.6% over the same period.  Employment gains in March were spread across several
industries, including health care and social assistance;
information, culture and recreation; and public administration.
There was a decline in educational services.  Employment increased in Ontario,  Quebec  and Manitoba, while
it declined in  New Brunswick  and  Nova Scotia .  In March, employment rose among people aged 55 and over and
among youths, while it was little changed for those aged 25 to
54.  Employment in March increased notably among private sector
employees, and edged up for public sector employees and the
self-employed. Over the past 12 months, the number of private
sector employees grew 1.7%, while public sector and self-
employment were little changed.  Employment increases in services  Following three months of small declines, employment in
health care and social assistance increased by 32,000 in March.
With these gains, employment in this industry was up 2.0%
(+42,000) compared with March 2011.  There were gains of 28,000 in information, culture and
recreation in March. Employment over the past 12 months
increased 6.7% (+52,000) in this industry, with all of the
growth occurring in the past four months.  Employment rose by 15,000 in public administration in March,
following a decline of similar magnitude the previous month.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in this industry was
little changed.  Natural resources employment edged up in March. Total
growth over the previous 12 months reached 11.0% (+37,000), the
fastest growth rate of all industries.  Following increases in the previous two months, employment
declined by 25,000 in educational services. Employment in the
industry remains little changed compared with March 2011.  Manufacturing employment edged up in March, the fourth
consecutive month of modest increases. However, compared with 12
months earlier, the number of factory workers was down slightly.  Gains in Central Canada  Following four months of little change, Ontario posted
employment gains of 46,000, all in full-time work. The
 unemployment rate  in the province declined 0.2 percentage points
to 7.4%, its lowest level in three years. With this month’s gain,
employment in Ontario was up 1.3% (+89,000) since March 2011.  Employment in Quebec increased by 36,000 in March, pushing
the unemployment rate down 0.5 percentage points to 7.9%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province was
unchanged.  Employment rose by 6,100 in Manitoba, bringing the
unemployment rate down 0.3 percentage points to 5.3%. With this
increase, employment in the province was up slightly compared
with 12 months earlier.  In March, employment fell by 5,700 in New Brunswick,
bringing employment down by 6,600 (-1.9%) from 12 months earlier.
While Nova Scotia showed declines in March (-2,900), the
employment level in the province was slightly up from 12 months
earlier (+0.7%).  While employment in  Alberta  was little changed in March,
employment growth continued to be the highest among the
provinces for the 12-month period, at 3.1% (+65,000). With more
people participating in the labour market in March, the
unemployment rate increased 0.3 percentage points to 5.3%.  Increases among people aged 55 and over and youths  Employment among those aged 55 and over continued on an
upward trend in March, up 47,000. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment among men and women of this age group
increased 5.8% or 176,000, partly because of population aging.  Employment rose by 39,000 among youths aged 15 to 24 in
March, pushing their unemployment rate down 0.8 percentage
points to 13.9%. Despite the increase in March, the number of
youths employed has changed little since July 2009--the lowest
point of the last labour market downturn.  Employment was unchanged among people aged 25 to 54 in
March. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for this age
group was up slightly, with gains among both men and women.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following estimates are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  Employment levels in all three territories were little
changed from the first quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of
2012.  Over the same period, the unemployment rate increased from
5.1% to 9.0% in Yukon and rose from 6.3% to 8.7% in the
 Northwest Territories , as more people were looking for work.
During the same period, the unemployment rate in Nunavut
declined from 17.3% to 15.3%, as fewer people participated in
the labour market.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey estimates are based on a sample,
and are therefore subject to sampling variability. Estimates for
smaller geographic areas or industries will have more
variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates, and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For general information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends. ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010 -
