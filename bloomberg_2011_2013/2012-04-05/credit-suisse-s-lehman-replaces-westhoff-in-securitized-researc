Credit Suisse Group AG (CS)  promoted
Roger Lehman to be its head of securitized products research,
replacing Dale Westhoff, who will focus more on the company’s
Locus analytics system for clients.  Lehman will also remain the company’s lead strategist for
commercial-mortgage securities, according to an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. Steve Vames, a spokesman for the
Zurich-based bank in New York, confirmed the contents.  Westhoff, the former Bear Stearns Cos. analyst who was top-
ranked for mortgage prepayments for 15 years in a row in polls
by Institutional Investor magazine, joined Credit Suisse last
year amid a push by the bank to expand in securitized product
research and analytics, or computer programs used to assess the
value of debt. The company hired Lehman from Bank of America
Corp. later in 2011.  Credit Suisse has also expanded the responsibilities of
Mahesh Swaminathan to include all of the company’s residential
mortgage-bond strategy, according to the memo. He had been the
bank’s senior strategist for government-backed home-loan
securities, after joining the company almost a decade ago.  The company also plans to change the name of Locus
to Credit Suisse PLUS Analytics (powered by LOCUS)
this month as the bank brings all of its fixed-income
electronic proprietary systems under one brand, according to
an e-mail today to clients.  To contact the reporters on this story:
