People.cn Co. , which operates the
website of the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper,
aims to raise at least 527 million yuan ($84 million) from an
initial public offering in Shanghai to improve its portal and
add users.  The web portal will use proceeds from the stock sale to
improve its service for mobile-phone users, upgrade networks and
boost hiring of editorial staff, it said in an IPO prospectus
filed to the Shanghai stock exchange today. People.cn, a unit of
the People’s Daily, will set the price for its IPO on April 20,
and start marketing the stock to investors tomorrow, it said.  People.cn said it is upgrading services to attract users
and compete with online portals run by companies including U.S.-
listed  Sina Corp. (SINA)  and  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  Parent People’s Daily,
founded in 1948, is the official newspaper of the ruling
Communist Party.  “In terms of website visitors, we are significantly
lagging commercial websites such as Sina and Sohu,” People.cn
said in the prospectus. Competitors enjoy advantages in
accessing  capital markets  and content, it said.  People.cn will use IPO proceeds to fund a 527 million yuan,
3-year spending program to upgrade services, it said. If the
company raises more money from the IPO than is needed for the
spending program, the surplus will be used for working capital,
it said.  People.cn will offer 69 million shares, representing 25
percent of its enlarged share capital, in the proposed IPO. At
present, People’s Daily owns almost 80 percent of the website’s
stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
