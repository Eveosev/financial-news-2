The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.4 percent to 686.28 at 4:54 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials climbed
0.2 percent to 1,596.589.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rebounded from a seven-week low in New York before data
that may signal an improving economic outlook in the U.S., the
world’s biggest consumer of crude.  Oil for May delivery gained as much as 87 cents to $102.34
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $102.26 at 2:35 p.m. Singapore time. The

Prices are down 0.7 percent since March 30, putting crude on
track for its fourth weekly decline.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures dropped for the first time in three
days in  New York  amid speculation that a government report will
show a larger-than-average increase in stockpiles of the heating
and power-plant fuel.  Gas declined 2.1 percent as the median of 17 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an inventory increase of
34 billion cubic feet in the week ended March 30. The five-year
average change is a gain of 8 billion. The Energy Department is
scheduled to release its storage report tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.  OIL PRODUCTS  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $120.09 a metric ton at 3:37 p.m. Singapore time
from $135.29 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the

period ended March 9.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude fell 20 cents
to $15.57 a barrel at 3:52 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference, also known as the
crack spread, has widened 0.5 percent this week.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is poised for its first weekly decline since mid-March
as concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and speculation there
won’t be more U.S. stimulus strengthened the dollar. Platinum
fell to the lowest level in two months.  While spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,625.18 an ounce at
3:09 p.m. in Singapore, the price has dropped 2.6 percent this
week. Bullion tumbled to $1,612.20 yesterday, the lowest level
since Jan. 10. Platinum, the year’s best-performing precious
metal, lost as much as 0.8 percent to $1,587.75 an ounce, the
lowest since Feb. 1, before climbing 0.2 percent to $1,603.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed for the first time in three days on
speculation that the central bank in  China , the world’s biggest
consumer, will ease monetary policy, boosting demand. Aluminum,
zinc and nickel advanced.  Three-month copper rose as much as 0.6 percent to $8,400.50
a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and traded at $8,390
by 4:13 p.m. Tokyo time. The metal tumbled 3.1 percent
yesterday, the most since Jan. 4. May-delivery metal was up 0.5
percent at $3.8090 a pound on the Comex.  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  April 5 (Bloomberg) -- Soybeans headed for a second weekly
gain on speculation global supply may be smaller than estimated
as crop losses from drought in South America deepen, pushing
importers to buy more from the U.S., the largest grower.  The May-delivery contract rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$14.28 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. It traded at
$14.2725 a bushel at 3:01 p.m. Singapore time, set for a 1.7
percent gain this week. In China, soybeans for September
delivery climbed as much as 2.4 percent to 4,618 yuan ($732) a
metric ton, the highest price for the most-active contract on
the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  since Sept. 16.  Corn for May delivery gained 0.3 percent to $6.585 a bushel
in Chicago, making this week’s gain 2.3 percent. There’s no
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade tomorrow in observance of
the Good Friday holiday. Wheat for May delivery gained 0.2
percent to $6.4075 a bushel, trimming the weekly loss to 3
percent.  Rubber dropped to the lowest level in more than a month as
weaker demand at a Spanish bond auction reignited concern that
Europe will struggle to overcome its debt crisis, curbing demand
for the raw material used to make tires.  September-delivery rubber fell as much as 1.7 percent to
321.8 yen a kilogram ($3,911 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since March 7, before settling at 326.5 yen. Futures
have surged 24 percent this year.  Palm-oil reserves in  Malaysia , the second-biggest supplier
after  Indonesia , probably declined to the lowest level in seven
months in March as exports outpaced growth in production,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Stockpiles fell 2.4 percent to 2.01 million metric tons,
from 2.06 million tons in February, according to the median of
estimates in the survey of four analysts and two plantation
companies. Inventories are expected to be 25 percent higher than
a year earlier, the survey showed. Official estimates from the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board are scheduled for release on April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
