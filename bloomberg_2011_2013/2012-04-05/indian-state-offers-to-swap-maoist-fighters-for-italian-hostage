Indian authorities have offered to
free 27 jailed Maoist guerrillas and supporters to secure the
release of a regional lawmaker and an Italian tourist being held
captive by the left-wing extremists.  The Maoists are yet to respond to the offer from the
government of the eastern state of  Odisha . Chief Minister Naveen
Patnaik announced details of the possible swap in the regional
assembly yesterday in Bhubaneswar, saying eight of those he’s
willing to free from prisons are Maoist fighters.  The state government’s response follows talks between
Maoist negotiators and the authorities. Rebels on March 24
kidnapped the ruling party legislator, 10 days after they had
taken two Italian nationals hostage. One of the Europeans was
freed March 25.  Odisha is one of the more than nine of the county’s 28
states where left-wing guerrillas, locally known as Naxalites,
are active. These provinces are rich in  iron ore , coal, bauxite,
manganese and other minerals, and have the potential to attract
billions of dollars in investment.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  has called the Naxalites the
greatest threat to India’s internal security. Maoists killed 606
civilians and security forces last year, according to the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
