Russian electricity and power
providers are giving up first-quarter gains on speculation the
cancellation of an  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  share sale signals that the
government is tightening its grip on the sector.  RusHydro dropped to a two-month low in  New York  yesterday,
after surging a record 21 percent in the first three months of
2012, as the Kommersant newspaper reported that Deputy Prime
Minister  Igor Sechin  had urged  Russia ’s biggest hydropower
generator to scrap a plan to sell treasury shares to state-run
Vnesheconombank. Futures expiring in June on Moscow’s  RTS  Index
rose 0.9 percent to 159,200 in U.S. trading, while the  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies listed in New York
fell to a two-month low.  Russia’s President-elect  Vladimir Putin  delayed power-price
increases due in January by six months when campaigning ahead of
the March 4 election, according to Troika Dialog and  Alfa Bank .
 OAO Inter RAO UES (IRAO) , Russia’s state-controlled electricity
producer, is the worst performer on Moscow’s Micex Index this
year, while utilities  OAO OGK-1 (OGKA)  and IDGC Holding have had their
poorest start to a quarter since the period ended Sept. 30,
2011, after climbing in the first three months.  “This news exacerbates investors’ attitudes toward the
whole sector,” Alexander Kornilov, a senior analyst at Alfa
Bank in Moscow, Russia’s biggest private lender, said by phone
yesterday. “It doesn’t help the valuations of other utility
companies because the government’s strategy for the sector is
unclear.”  Russia ETF Drops  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, fell for the first time in five days,
losing 2.4 percent to $30.48 yesterday. The  RTS Volatility
Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the index futures,
dropped 5.1 percent to 31.72 yesterday.  RusHydro’s American depositary receipts trade at 8.3 times
analysts’ estimated earnings, compared with an average valuation
of 11.9 times for power and  utilities companies  on the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index. OGK-1, a Moscow-based electricity and
heating provider, trades for 6.7 times estimated earnings, while
 Federal Grid Co. (FEES) , Russia’s monopoly for high-voltage power
transmission, has a ratio of 9.6 times.  ADRs of RusHydro declined 3.3 percent to $3.56 in New York
yesterday, the lowest level since Jan. 24. The company’s Micex-
traded stock fell 3.5 percent to 1.049 rubles, or 3.6 cents, in
Moscow. Each ADR represents 100 ordinary shares.  The hydroelectricity company was scheduled to approve the
sale of 63 billion rubles ($2.1 billion) of treasury shares to
the state development bank to help fund new power stations amid
rising tariffs, Kommersant reported yesterday.  ‘Creates Uncertainty’  “This share sale was intended to show the government’s
support for the company,” Sergey Beiden, an analyst at Otkritie
Financial Corp. in Moscow, said by phone. “Now the company
won’t have additional cash from the expected share sale and this
raises the likelihood that the company will have to revise its
investment plans. This creates uncertainty.”  RusHydro may instead use loans from state-controlled OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, and has cut two power
stations from its investment program, Kommersant said, citing
RusHydro.  Utility companies may have to wait as long as a year before
the government increases tariffs,  Chris Weafer , chief strategist
at Troika Dialog, Sberbank’s investment banking arm, said on
March 12 in a phone interview from Moscow.  ‘No Sense’  Putin, who won what will be his third term as president in
the vote, pledged in a Jan. 30 article in the Vedomosti
newspaper to divest the government’s stakes in major non-
commodity companies and lower its holdings in some commodity
producers by 2016, excluding utilities and defense enterprises.  “The RusHydro news shows that the government talks about
improving the investment climate in Russia, but then does things
that make no sense,” Otkritie’s Beiden said. “Investors won’t
be buying the power sector until the rules of the game become
clear.”  Calls and e-mails made yesterday to RusHydro’s offices in
Moscow outside of business hours weren’t answered or immediately
returned.  Micex-traded shares of  Inter Rao (IRAO)  slid 3.2 percent to 3
kopeks yesterday, extending an 11 percent slump in the first
quarter. OGK-1 dropped 3 percent to 67 kopeks, after gaining 4.9
percent in the first three months of the year.  IDGC Holding fell for the first time in four days, losing
3.9 percent yesterday in Moscow to 3.21 rubles, or 11 U.S.
cents. The stock surged 43 percent in the first quarter, the
most since 2010.  Federal Grid (FEES)  slipped 2.8 percent yesterday to
31 kopeks.  Crude Slumps  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,

yesterday, the biggest one-day drop since March 6. The dollar-
denominated RTS dropped 2.9 percent to 1,632.21.  Crude fell for a second day as U.S. inventories rose by

in the U.S., the lowest level since March 12. The oil producer’s
preferred stock listed on the Micex lost 3.9 percent to 20.22
rubles, or 69 U.S. cents.  Outflows Intensify  Russian net private capital outflows were $35.1 billion in
the first quarter from a revised $35 billion in the last three
months of 2011, the central bank said in a statement on its
website yesterday, citing a preliminary estimate. Total outflows
for 2011 were $80.5 billion, Bank Rossii said.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ’s ADRs slid 3.5 percent to $9.06 in New York,
the biggest one-day drop since March 22. Russia’s biggest coal
producer for steelmakers lost 4.7 percent to 266.30 rubles in
Moscow, or the equivalent of $9.04. One Mechel ADR represents
one ordinary share.  Prices for all metals declined in  London , with copper
falling by the most since December, after the minutes from a
March 13 meeting of the  Federal Reserve ’s Open Market Committee
showed decreased urgency for further monetary stimulus.  “This is the market’s negative first reaction to the
report that the Fed may not continue with the monetary easing,”
Oleg Petropavlovskiy, a metals and mining analyst at Moscow’s
Broker Credit Service, said by phone today. “All commodities
fell today on this fear.”  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , Russia’s biggest mining company,
slipped 3.1 percent to $18.07 in New York yesterday, the lowest
level since Jan. 23. The  ADRs (MTL)  traded at a 0.2 discount to the
company’s Moscow shares, narrowed from a two-week high of 1
percent on April 3. Norilsk declined 2.9 percent to 5,339
