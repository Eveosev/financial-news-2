Germany  will pay less for
electricity from renewable sources than from coal and natural
gas in 2030 if it reaches energy targets, the environment
ministry said.  Renewable power will cost 7.6 euro cents per kilowatt-hour
in 2030, with hard coal and natural gas rising to more than 9
euro cents per kilowatt-hour, the ministry said today in an e-
mailed statement, citing a new  study  it commissioned.  The 331-page document monitors a plan to exit nuclear
energy by 2022 and raise the share of renewable sources to at
least 35 percent of the power mix by the end of this decade. It
forecasts Germany beating that target to reach a share of about
40 percent renewables by 2020, up from 20 percent now.  The study’s projections show “that the plan to transform
our energy mix is doable,” Environment Minister Norbert
Roettgen said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
