Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s  China  unit will
invest about $600 million to increase the capacity of one of its
passenger-car factories by almost 60 percent as it looks to
expand its operations in the world’s largest auto market.  The automaker, along with joint venture partner  Changan
Automobile Group Co. (CFORDZ) , will raise capacity at its factory in the
southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing by 350,000 units to
950,000 vehicles annually by 2014, Ford said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Construction is expected to begin
immediately, it said.  Expansion in the world’s largest vehicle market is part of
Chief Executive Officer  Alan Mulally ’s push to increase annual
global sales by 50 percent to 8 million vehicles by 2015 and
have one third of its deliveries in  Asia  by 2020.  “The Chinese  auto industry  remains the biggest growth
market in the world,” David Schoch, chairman of Ford China,
said in the statement. “Expanding our production capacity in
Chongqing is a key part of our aggressive growth plans in China
and Asia.” Ford will introduce 15 new vehicles and 20 new
engines and transmissions in China by 2015, the automaker said.  China’s vehicle sales this year will probably miss their 8
percent growth forecast as the slowing economy and rising fuel
costs curb buying, Gu Xianghua, deputy secretary general of the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, said last month,
citing his personal opinion.  Vehicle sales growth in China slowed last year from 32
percent in 2010 after the government withdrew a two-year package
of tax breaks and rebates that helped the country overtake the
U.S. Total auto sales, including those of commercial vehicles,
grew 2.5 percent in 2011, according to the industry group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
