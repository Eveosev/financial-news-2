Republican National Committee
Chairman Reince Priebus said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ” airing this
weekend that Democrats and the media have created a phony
conflict with the role of gender in U.S. elections.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin to show with Republican National
Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for
joining us. The primary was held in your state of  Wisconsin  last
week. It’s obvious to almost everyone, Mitt Romney is going to
be the nominee, but I noticed in Wisconsin, your home state,
he’s trailing Barack Obama by 11 or 17 points in two polls. He’s
got a real uphill challenge, doesn’t he?  REINCE PRIEBUS: I think it’s pretty early out. So first of
all, you’ve got a couple things there. No. 1, the primary in
Wisconsin was a big night. I agree with you for  Governor Romney .
Now obviously I have to be neutral but I don’t have to avoid the
facts. It was a good night for  Mitt Romney . There’s just no
question.  HUNT: Why is he behind by 11 in one poll and 17 in the
other?  PRIEBUS: Well, let me get to that point right now. I think
some of that polling was prior to the election on Tuesday. I
would imagine now that if you did a poll this week and over the
weekend you’re going to see those numbers close. My only point
is, is that head-to-head is very early to be comparing in these
kinds of states, and I think especially in Wisconsin; I think
people are focused in on Governor Walker and that situation.  I’m confident that it will be a very, very close election
in Wisconsin and I think if the Democrats overplayed their hand
as they’ve done in this recall election I actually think the
Republican nominee can win Wisconsin in November.  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, a huge issue in November is going to be
the  Supreme Court ’s decision on health care. After hearing the
arguments, are you persuaded the court’s going to rule one way
or another and what will the political ramifications be?  PRIEBUS: I certainly agree with most people in that the
mandate seems to be in real big trouble. I think it’s a matter
of our Constitution, separation of power, the 10th Amendment,
 James Madison ; everything foundational to America. I think it
will get struck down and I think it will be good for a country
that get struck down but I also think then -  HUNT: Was it appropriate for President Obama to comment on
why the courts would be engaged in judicial activism it if it
overturned the law?  PRIEBUS: I don’t get that at all as a 13-, 14-year lawyer.
If anything, what we have is a court that is looking at the
separation of powers and the 10th Amendment. It’s the most
fundamental issue in our country as far as federalism -  HUNT: Do think it was inappropriate for the president say
that?  PRIEBUS: I don’t know if it’s appropriate, I just think
it’s foolish. It sort of disingenuous and foolish as a lawyer
and a former law professor. So for fundamentally unsound. I
think it makes him look foolish as a lawyer, to tell you the
truth.  HUNT: Tell me, size up the role that money is going to play
in this year’s election and which side has the advantage.  PRIEBUS: I don’t know if we are going to be able to raise
as much as  Barack Obama  since he’s in love with raising money,
but we are not going to have any money problems on the
Republican side of the aisle. In fact, right now we have more
money than the Democratic National Committee right now and I
think that once we get our nominee where we will be off to the
races, and I don’t believe that at the end of the day the
president is going to have much of an advantage over us.  So this isn’t going to come down to a lack of money; you’re
going to have $1 billion on one side and you’re going to have
somewhere near that on the other side.  HUNT: Your side might have an advantage with the outside
groups, at least the Harold Simmons the Koch brothers and the
like huge funding, and a lot of it going through  Karl Rove . When
was the last time you talked to Karl Rove?  PRIEBUS: Maybe a few weeks ago.  HUNT: Do you talk to him regularly?  PRIEBUS: I don’t know what that means, regularly, but every
once in a while I see Karl and I think he’s doing great work and
I think he’s done great work in our country and for our party so
I think is a good resource.  HUNT: Those outside groups can make a big difference, don’t
you think?  PRIEBUS: Well, I think both sides have those outside
groups, but I think fundamentally what’s most important now, and
I think this is true. This thing is not going to be done on
television and radio. I believe that door-to-door campaigning,
voter-to-voter contacts is the only way to truly win these races
and it’s going to happen in the battleground states in this
country and we are going to be ready to fight.  HUNT: Let me ask you this. The Democrats of course say you
are waging, the GOP is waging a war on women. I know you don’t
agree with that, but looking at the polls, you have a gender gap
problem. Recent polls show a huge, huge margin for Democrats
among women voters. How big a problem is it? How do you close
it?  PRIEBUS: Well, for one thing, if the Democrats said we had
a war on caterpillars, and mainstream media outlet talked about
the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we
have problems with caterpillars. The fact of the matter is it’s
a fiction and this started a war against the Vatican that this
president pursued. He still hasn’t answered Archbishop Dolan’s
issues with Obama world and Obamacare, so I think that’s the
first issue.  How to we combat it? We make the case to women and everyone
in this country, no matter what your background, that No. 1,
this president hasn’t fulfilled his promises. No. 2, we can do
better in this country in regard to jobs and the economy. People
need to be having better jobs. They need to make more money.
They need to be more prosperous and it’s the  Republican Party 
that wants to help everybody, no matter where you are, whatever
income bracket, we believe that jobs should be better, people
should be doing better and choices should be more. That’s what
our case is going to be and hope women in this country are going
to accept that.  HUNT: How about the Latino vote? Recent polls have showed
that Obama is beating Romney 5 to 1 among Latinos. That’s a huge
problem. How big of a Latino vote do you think you can get in
November?  PRIEBUS: I think we can get up to 40 percent or better. I
think if you look at where we are at as far as top-line
messaging when it comes to jobs and the economy we do much,
much, much better in the Latino communities in 2012 and then we
did in 2008. I think that’s easily acceptable, but secondly
we’ve got better messengers like  Marco Rubio , Susana Martinez,
Brian Sandoval, and Luis Fortuno in  Puerto Rico  was the governor
there that will be very helpful to us in  Florida . So I think
we’re doing much better with messengers, but ultimately where we
need to go out, what my job is and what our job at the RNC is,
is to take our message into Hispanic and Latino communities.  That I think is where we need to go, and obviously that’s
the direction we’re heading. You’re seeing some of the hiring
that were doing around the country and fulfilling that mission.  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, party chairmen are always optimistic
and I’m sure you are now, but give me your forecast for a big
surprise when upset we may see this fall.  PRIEBUS: For one thing, and it’s not going to be much of a
surprise, but Barack Obama is going to lose. I do think we are
going to win the Senate and I think we are going to do it not
just in places like  Virginia  and Florida and  Ohio  but I think we
are going to win in Wisconsin and I think you look at Linda
Lingle out in  Hawaii ; although she’s not getting a lot of press
out in the mainstream media, I think she’s a senator that wins
out in Hawaii. So I think we have so many opportunities in the
Senate, Al, that I think that a lot of them are going to come in
and we will win the majority of the Senate.  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, thank you very much and a happy weekend
to you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
