Snam SpA (SRG)  hired banks for a 12
billion-euro ($16 billion) bridge loan to repay debt owed to  Eni
SpA (ENI) , which is selling its 50 percent stake in the Italian gas
network, according to two people familiar with the matter.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., BNP Paribas SA, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA
and UniCredit SpA will coordinate the facility, which will be
underwritten by a wider syndicate of lenders, said the people,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Eni,  Italy ’s biggest energy producer, is preparing to sell
its 5.9 billion-euro stake in Snam after the Italian government
ordered the spinoff in January to boost competition and reduce
energy prices for consumers. The government must decree on the
separation by the end of May before the manner of the disposal
and the structure of the loan is decided, the people said.  The bridge loan will be used to refinance Eni loans to Snam
if the gas network is spun off rather than sold to another
buyer, the people said. The bridge would then be refinanced by
bonds issued by Snam once it obtains a  credit rating .  Snam’s stock  fell  1.1 percent today to trade at 3.5 euros a
share at 3:26 p.m. in Milan, paring its gains this year to 2.4
percent.  Eni spokesman Filippo Cotalini in  Rome  and a Snam spokesman
in San Donato Milanese declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
