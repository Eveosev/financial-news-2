Sulzer AG (SUN)  is negotiating a new
revolving  credit line  of about 500 million Swiss francs ($543
million) to refinance borrowings after acquiring a rival
pumpmaker last year.  The facility will partly replace a 700 million-franc
revolver maturing this year and next, Sulzer’s Chief Financial
Officer Juergen Brandt said today in an interview after the
company’s annual general meeting in Winterthur.  “We are taking advantage of the good market conditions for
bank debt and Sulzer’s recent good results,” Brandt said.  Sulzer will announce the transaction when it closes in the
next weeks, Brandt said. For the 2007 credit line, 19 banks were
part of the banking syndicate, and Sulzer now wants to cut that
number by half as it no longer requires the add-on services
offered the first time, the executive said. Sulzer will focus on
its key lenders Zuercher Kantonal Bank, UBS AG, Credit Suisse AG
and Bank of America Corp.  The Swiss engineering company acquired Cardo Flow Solutions
of  Sweden  for 858 million francs in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
