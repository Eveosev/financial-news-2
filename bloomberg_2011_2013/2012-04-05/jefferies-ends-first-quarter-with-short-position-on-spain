Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , rebounding
this year after reassuring investors it can weather turmoil in
Europe, took a net short position on Spanish debt as it doubled
a negative stance on five of the region’s riskiest nations.  Jefferies’s net exposure to Spain was negative $58.8
million when the fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 29, the firm
said today in a regulatory filing. The figure reflects ties to
sovereign issuers, corporations, financial institutions and
mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The company previously
said it had a net long position of $84.5 million on Nov. 30.  Spain’s prime minister,  Mariano Rajoy , signaled yesterday
his nation’s economic situation is one of “extreme
difficulty,” raising the threat of an international bailout.
Jefferies’s shift on  Spain  expanded the firm’s total net short
position on five European nations -- also including Portugal,
Ireland, Italy and Greece -- to $192.8 million at the end of the
first quarter. The New York-based investment bank had reported a
$96.1 million net short position the previous period.  Jefferies fell 1.2 percent to $18.31 today in  New York . The
shares have climbed 33 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
