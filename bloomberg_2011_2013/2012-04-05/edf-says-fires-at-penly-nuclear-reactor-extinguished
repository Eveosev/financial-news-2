Electricite de  France  SA, the
biggest operator of nuclear reactors, said two fires were put
out in their early stages at its Penly plant in Normandy.  It didn’t say what caused the blazes and where they
started. No casualties or damage to the environment were
reported. Unit 2 shut down automatically after smoke was
detected in the reactor building, the Paris-based company said
today on its website.  Earlier, data on the website of Reseau de Transport
d’Electricite, the French grid operator, showed that EDF halted
the 1,330-megawatt reactor at 12:20 p.m. local time.  There are two reactors at the site in northern France.
Penly-1 was generating normally this morning, according to the
latest data available.  The fire comes as the future of nuclear energy in France
has sparked debate between President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and his
Socialist Party rival  Francois Hollande  ahead of presidential
elections this month and next. Sarkozy backs atomic power while
Hollande is seeking to reduce France’s dependence on atomic
energy and close the country’s oldest plants.  An explosion and fire at an EDF nuclear-waste processing
plant in the town of Codolet in southern France in September
killed one person and injured four, heightening concern of
safety risks from atomic energy following last year’s Fukushima
disaster in  Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
