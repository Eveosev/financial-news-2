Golf in the U.S. is growing for the 
first time in five years as an economic recovery strengthens 
enough to be measured in the clubs, cleats and plaid shorts 
that fuel the sport’s $25 billion consumer market.  The number of rounds played on American golf courses has 
climbed for four straight months through February. Club maker 
Callaway Golf Co., mower-maker Toro Co. and Nike Inc., which
makes golf gear and clothes, are registering revenue growth and 
stock gains outpacing the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.
