New York gasoline strengthened after
 PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  reported a compressor failure at its plant in
Delaware.  The company flared gases at its Delaware City refinery
resulting from the equipment failure yesterday, according to a
filing with state regulators.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in  New York Harbor (MOSN87PM)  narrowed 1.5 cents to 10.75 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:02 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories of blending components on the East Coast fell
594,000 barrels to 49.1 million barrels last week, the lowest
level since January, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
