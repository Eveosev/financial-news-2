Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba has started walking again, less than three weeks after
suffering cardiac arrest in a game, manager Owen Coyle said.  Muamba has been in  London  Chest Hospital since collapsing
on the field during an F.A. Cup quarterfinal at Tottenham on
March 17. It took two hours for doctors to get the soccer
player’s heart working.  “Fabrice has been taking small steps, is talking and has
got that big smile on his face, which we love to see,” manager
Coyle said on Bolton’s  website . “We’ve got to stress that he
has got a long way to go but the improvement has been remarkable
and long may that continue.”  Muamba celebrates his 24th birthday tomorrow. The former
England under-21 national team member, who was born in the
 Democratic Republic  of Congo, is in his fourth season with
Bolton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
