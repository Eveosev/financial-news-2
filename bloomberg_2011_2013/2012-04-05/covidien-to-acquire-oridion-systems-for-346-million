Covidien Plc (COV) , a maker of health-care
products for clinical and home settings, agreed to buy  Oridion
Systems Ltd. (ORIDN) , an Israeli medical-device maker, for $346 million.  Covidien will pay about 21.04 Swiss francs ($23) a Oridion
share, 75 percent higher than yesterday’s closing stock price.
The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter,
according to a statement.  The acquisition of Jerusalem-based Oridion, a maker of
devices for patient breathing safety, is intended to add to
Covidien’s portfolio of devices to monitor “respiratory
function for patients around the world,” Robert J. White,
president of Respiratory & Monitoring Systems at Covidien, said
in the statement. Oridion had $64.5 million of revenue in 2011.  Covidien doesn’t expect the transaction to have a material
effect on its fiscal 2012 sales, operating margin or earnings
per share, the Dublin-based company said in the statement. The
boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is is
subject to Oridion shareholders’ approval, Covidien and Oridion
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
