PPG Industries Inc. (PPG) , the world’s
second-biggest paint maker, reported first-quarter profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates after seeing increased demand from
the aerospace and automotive markets.  Profit was 2 cents to 7 cents a share, Pittsburgh-based PPG
said today in a preliminary earnings statement. Excluding costs
related to job cuts in  Europe  and the clean-up of a contaminated
New Jersey site, earnings were $1.75 to $1.80 a share, up from
$1.40 a year earlier, PPG said. The average estimate of 14
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $1.44.  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Charles Bunch said
“strong” demand in  North America  and “solid” conditions in
Asia for new-car paint and products used in eye glasses and
airplanes more than made up for “muted” European demand. The
company plans to eliminate 2,000 employees, mostly at its
European coatings business.  PPG rose 2.5 percent to $96.29 at the close in  New York .  U.S. house-paint sales benefited from mild winter weather,
PPG said. Low domestic natural-gas costs also boosted its
results, the company said.  The job cuts and other restructuring activities will cost
about $208 million before tax and will save about $140 million a
year, including $40 million to $50 million this year, PPG said.  The company added $160 million to reserves for state-
mandated remediation in New Jersey and expects to spend $100
million a year on the project for several years.  PPG had $129 million reserved as of Dec. 31 to clean up
soil at its former chromium factory in  Jersey City , according to
a Feb. 16 regulatory filing.  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  of the Netherlands is the world’s largest
paint maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
