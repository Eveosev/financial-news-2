Former Russian Finance Minister
 Alexei Kudrin  doesn’t plan to return to government “in the
nearest future,” instead creating a group to support civic
initiatives.  The Civic Initiative Committee will “oppose the actions of
the authorities” and propose “alternative ways of solving
political, economic and social problems,” according to a
statement.  The committee will promote its initiatives through mayors
of Russian cities, who have “enough power” to implement the
its proposals, Kudrin told reporters today in Moscow. A
foundation that would seek donations from Russian businessmen,
rather than from abroad, may be set up to finance the
committee’s activities, he added.  Kudrin left his post as finance minister last year after a
public spat with President Dmitry Medvedev over plans to
increase military spending. He has since discussed forming a
political party with billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , who ran
against Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  for president in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
