New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking-coal, dropped for a second day to its
lowest level this year as renewed concern about  Europe â€™s debt
crisis drove investors from riskier assets.  NWR retreated as much as 5.1 percent to its lowest intraday
level since Dec. 20 and traded down 3.2 percent to 125 koruna by
12:37 p.m. in Prague. The stock has lost 5.7 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
