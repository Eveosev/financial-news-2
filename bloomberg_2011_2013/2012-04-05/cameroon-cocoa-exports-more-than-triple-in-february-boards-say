Exports of cocoa from Cameroon,
 Africa â€™s fourth-largest producer of the crop, more than tripled
in February, the seventh month of the season, according to a
report from the Cocoa and Coffee Board and the Cocoa and Coffee
Interprofessional Board.  Shipments rose to 9,702 metric tons from 2,639 tons during
the same period a year earlier, the institutions said in a
report e-mailed from the port city of Douala today.  The country has exported 159,494 tons of cocoa since the
season started, compared with 176,642 tons the previous year,
according to the report. Olam Cam, a unit of Singapore-based
 Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , was the biggest exporter with 2,057
tons, the data showed.  The cocoa season in the Central African nation runs from
Aug. 1 to July 31 of the following year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
