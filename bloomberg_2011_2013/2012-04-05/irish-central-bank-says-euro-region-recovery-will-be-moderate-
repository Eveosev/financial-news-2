Ireland’s central bank said the 17-
member euro-region  economy  may show a “slow and moderate”
recovery this year, with growth resuming in the second half.  “Although there have been tentative signs of stabilization
in economic activity, the risks to the euro-area outlook remain
on the downside and relate to a further intensification of the
tensions in euro-area financial markets and their potential
spillover to the real economy,” the Dublin-based central bank
said in its quarterly report published today. “Additional risks
include a further slowdown in the global economy” as well as
“further increases in energy prices.”  The European Central Bank yesterday kept its  benchmark
interest rate  at 1 percent, matching a record low, after
injecting more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) into the
banking system to help contain the region’s fiscal crisis. While
President  Mario Draghi  forecast a “moderate recovery” in 2012,
he called talk of the central bank starting to withdraw its
emergency measures “premature.”  The Frankfurt-based central bank, whose liquidity injection
helped ease tensions on financial markets and lower borrowing
costs of some debt-burdened nations, forecasts the euro-region
economy will shrink about 0.1 percent this year.  “There was a marked improvement in financial-market
sentiment during the first quarter,” said the Irish central
bank, which is led by  Patrick Honohan , who also sits on the ECB
Governing Board. “Nevertheless, uncertainty is still at a high
level and financial-market conditions remain fragile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
