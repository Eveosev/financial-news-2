Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , the third-
largest provider of U.S. money market mutual funds, agreed to
acquire about $5 billion in money fund assets from  Fifth Third
Bancorp (FITB) , signaling its confidence in a business threatened by
potential new regulations.  Federated will transfer client assets from four Fifth Third
money funds into four similar funds it manages, the Pittsburgh-
based company said today in a statement. The companies didn’t
disclose terms of the deal, which they expect to complete in the
third quarter.  The U.S. money market fund industry has seen profits fall
because of record low interest rates, causing many providers to
waive some fees to keep client returns above zero. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is also preparing proposals
that fund executives have said would destroy the funds’
attractiveness by removing their stable $1 share price or
requiring them to set aside capital and restrict redemptions.  Federated is more dependent on money funds than any other
top fund company. It managed $256 billion in  money market funds 
as of Dec. 31, according to the company, representing about 69
percent of total assets.  Christopher Donahue, Federated’s chief executive officer,
has threated to sue the SEC if it proceeds with either of the
two plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
