Geothermal capacity in  Japan  could
grow almost fourfold to 2 gigawatts by the 2020s following the
government’s decision to allow projects in newly opened areas of
national parks, according to a research agency.  Japan’s geothermal sector may also benefit from a feed-in
tariff program starting in July to pay above-market rates for
renewable energy as well as 9 billion yen ($109 million) in
subsidies for feasibility studies and test drilling for the year
ending March 2013, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said.  “The expanded access rules, the resource study subsidy,
and the feed-in tariff should revive geothermal developments in
Japan,” the London-based agency said in a report.  Last month, the Ministry of Environment announced an
expansion of areas where developers may do surveys and build
geothermal  power plants  in national parks, where more than 80
percent of the nation’s resources are.  In addition to the current capacity of 537 megawatts, Japan
could develop some 1,000 megawatts, or 10 percent of resources,
in the newly opened national park areas, according to BNEF. The
country could also add about 500 megawatts of capacity outside
national parks, according to the estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
