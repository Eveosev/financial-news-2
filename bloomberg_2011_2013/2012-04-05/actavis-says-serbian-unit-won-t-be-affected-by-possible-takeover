Actavis Group hf , Switzerland-based
maker of generic drugs, said its production unit in  Serbia  is
doing well and won’t be affected by a possible acquisition.  Responding to local reports that an unconfirmed takeover of
Actavis by  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  may lead to job cuts at
the Serbian unit, Frank Staud, a spokesman for the Zug,
Switzerland-based Actavis said “nothing is done, nothing is
announced” about the reported talks.  “If there would be something going on between Watson and
Actavis, I would not be worried at all about Serbia,” Staud
said. “On the opposite, I think this would be good news for
Serbia because Watson is not here at all.”  The Serbian unit, acquired in 2002 for 3.5 million euros
($4.6 million), is the third-biggest drugmaker in the Balkan
country, after Actavis invested more than 35 million euros,
including 4 million euros last year to start production of a new
drug for  Parkinson’s disease . “We are doing very well in
Serbia. It’s one of our most important plants,” Staud said.  Watson Pharmaceuticals is nearing an agreement to purchase
Swiss drugmaker Actavis Group hf, to create one of the world’s
largest producers of generic drugs, people familiar with the
process said on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
