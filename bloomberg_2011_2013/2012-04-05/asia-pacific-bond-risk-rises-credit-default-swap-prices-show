The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment rose in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 5 basis points to
149.5 basis points as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to
prices from  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  The measure is set for its
highest close since March 29, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  advanced 4 basis points to 159.5 as of
8:09 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge is poised for a second daily increase, according
to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 2 basis points to 158 as
of 9:03 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The index
is headed for its highest close since March 26, according to
CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
