Dubai’s land department expects to
auction about 80 properties this year as more banks go through
the process of repossessing homes from defaulting buyers,
 Arabian Business  reported, citing Humaid Omran Al Shamsi, head
of the auction department.  About 35 properties may be put up for auction this month,
up from 35 auctioned in all of 2011, the Dubai-based magazine
reported, citing the government official.  Dubai’s law stipulates that repossessed properties must be
auctioned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
