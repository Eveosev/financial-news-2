DTEK, Ukraine’s largest non-state
coal and power producer, is considering buying anthracite coal
mines in the southern Russian Rostov region from billionaire
 Mikhail Gutseriev ,  Vedomosti  said.  DTEK is interested in a processing plant and two mines in
the region, the Moscow-based newspaper reported, citing two
unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Alexander Tolkach, a spokesman for DTEK in Kiev, declined
to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News. No talks are being
held on the matter, said a press official for Gutseriev’s
Russian Coal Co., who declined to be identified citing the
