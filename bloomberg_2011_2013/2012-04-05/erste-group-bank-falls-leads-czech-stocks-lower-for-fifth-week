Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  fell, leading
Czech shares toward a fifth weekly drop as rising borrowing
costs for France and Spain showed  Europe ’s debt crisis may not
be contained, driving investors from riskier assets.  Austria’s Erste slid 2.7 percent to 391.6 koruna by 11:37
a.m. in Prague, extending this week’s loss to 8.6 percent. The
14-member  PX (PX)  gauge, where Erste has a 18 percent weighting,
slumped 0.9 percent, headed for the biggest weekly retreat since
the five days ended Nov. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
