England  reached 239-2 at lunch on
day three of the final cricket Test against Sri Lanka to trail
the home team by 36 runs as it bids to tie the two-match series.  Alastair Cook, on 94, was the only batsman to get out in
the morning session in Colombo after England resumed at 154-1 in
reply to Sri Lankaâ€™s first-innings 275.  Jonathan Trott  was 62
not out at the interval with Kevin Pietersen on 18.  Opener Cook edged a turning delivery from Tillakaratne
Dilshan to Mahela Jayawardene at slip when six runs short of his
20th Test century.  England must win at the P. Sara Oval to retain the No. 1
Test ranking after losing the first Test by 75 runs. South
Africa will take the top spot should England fail to beat  Sri
Lanka , which is seeking its first Test series victory since
August 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
