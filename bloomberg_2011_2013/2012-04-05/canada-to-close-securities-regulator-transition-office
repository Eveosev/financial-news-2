The Canadian government said it will
keep open for another year an office set up to establish a
national securities regulator.  The finance department said in an order  posted  in the
Canada Gazette that the office will be dissolved July 12, 2013.
The new order will extend the office’s mandate by a year,
department spokesman Jack Aubry said by telephone.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in his budget last week
that the government is still consulting with the country’s
provinces on creating a national regulator.  Canada’s  Supreme Court  ruled in December that Flaherty’s
original plan for a single regulator was unconstitutional
because it infringed on provincial powers.  Canada is the only member of the Group of Seven nations
without a national securities watchdog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
