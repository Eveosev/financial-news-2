An Ethiopian company majority-owned
by Saudi billionaire Mohammed al-Amoudi plans to invest $600
million over two years to produce edible oil, its general
manager said.  Horizon Plantations  Ethiopia  leased a 20,000-hectare
(49,400-acre) plot in the northwestern Benishangul-Gumuz region
last month to grow groundnuts, as part of a government drive to
boost commercial agriculture, Jemal Ahmed said in an interview
on April 3 in the capital,  Addis Ababa .  Ethiopian-born al-Amoudi, who is ranked by Forbes magazine
as the world’s 63rd-richest person and was worth $12.3 billion
in March, owns 80 percent of the company, according to Ahmed.  The Horn of Africa nation imports up to 250,000 tons of
 palm oil  a year from  Malaysia , at a cost of more than $300
million, said Jemal, whose company Ahfa Pvt. Ltd. used to be one
of the top five importers of the product. “We want to
substitute that with this project.”  At full capacity, Horizon’s farm, which may be ready for
planting next year, should produce 150,000 tons of oil a year
from a processing plant in Bahir Dar city in Amhara region,
according to Jemal.  Ethiopia’s  Agriculture Ministry  has transferred 100,000
hectares in Benishangul to commercial farmers as part of the
agriculture project, and is offering a further 981,000 hectares,
about one-fifth of the state’s land. Nationwide, the government
says it plans to increase a  land bank  that sets aside 3.6
million hectares of Ethiopia’s total 110.4 million hectares for
commercial farming.  ‘Barren Land’  The four-year-old program has forcibly relocated more than
1 million Ethiopians in the south and east of the country,
according to the California-based advocacy group  Oakland
Institute . The government rejects the allegation.  Horizon’s river-irrigated plot, which it says the
government will increase to 35,000 hectares when 10,000 hectares
of the initial area is cleared, is “barren land,” according to
Jemal. “There are no human beings living in it,” he said.  Last month, the Addis Ababa-based company bought Gojeb
Agricultural Development Enterprise in the southern region from
the government for 35.1 million birr ($2 million), Jemal said.
It plans to grow bananas and pineapple for export on 1,500
hectares. Horizon jointly runs the nation’s largest coffee
estate, Bebeka, with the government in southwest Ethiopia, he
said.  Al-Amoudi’s companies also won bids for four other state-
owned enterprises, including the nation’s largest orange-grower,
Upper Awash Agro-Industry Enterprise, Privatization Agency
spokesman Wondefrash Assefa said on March 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
