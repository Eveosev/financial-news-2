The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars strengthened against most of their 16 major counterparts
before U.S. data tomorrow that may point to an improvement in
the labor market.  Demand for the South Pacific currencies was also bolstered
as Asian stocks pared declines. The Aussie was close to a six-
month low versus the New Zealand dollar as swaps traders
increased bets the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will cut  interest
rates  next month. Financial markets in both countries will close
tomorrow for holidays and reopen on April 10.  “We are seeing some profit taking ahead of tomorrow’s
nonfarm-payroll release,” Jesper Bargmann, regional head of
spot trading for major currencies in  Singapore  at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, said referring to the greenback and U.S.
employment report. “It is only natural that we see some degree
of profit taking before a thin Friday with an important
release.”  The Aussie rose 0.3 percent to $1.0298 as of 1:55 p.m. in
 New York . New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.2
percent to 81.61 U.S. cents. The Australian dollar rose 0.1
percent to NZ$1.2617. It touched NZ$1.2576 yesterday, the
weakest since Oct. 6.  The MSCI World Index of shares was down 0.3 percent after
earlier falling as much as 0.5 percent.  Employment in the U.S. probably rose by 205,000 in March,
according to the median estimate of economists before tomorrow’s
government report. That would be the fourth straight month with
jobs growth above 200,000.  Traders see a 90 percent chance that the RBA will lower its
benchmark interest rate to 4 percent from 4.25 percent at its
next meeting on May 1, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG
 index  based on overnight index swap rates. Yields on  Australia ’s
 three-year notes  declined as much as six basis points to 3.38
percent, the lowest since Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
