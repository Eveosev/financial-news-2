Gustavo Ferraro,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s head
for Latin America debt capital markets, has left the bank,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Efforts to contact Ferraro, who joined Barclays in 2003
from Citigroup Inc., for comment were unsuccessful.  Mark Lane , a
spokesman with Barclays in New York, declined to comment on the
move.  LatinFinance earlier reported Ferraro’s departure.  Barclays also appointed Monica Hanson as head of global
finance Latin America, a position in which she will oversee debt
capital markets, equity capital markets and leveraged finance
for the region, according to Lane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
