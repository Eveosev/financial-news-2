NV Nordisk Vindkraft AB, a Sweden-
based unit of Renewable Energy Systems Ltd., bought a group of
Norwegian wind projects that could generate as much as 500
megawatts of power. No terms were disclosed.  NV Nordisk Vindkraft acquired the five facilities in
southwestern  Norway  from HybridTech Holding AS, a Norwegian
wind-energy developer, the Gothenburg-based company said in a
website  statement .  Norway and  Sweden  established a common green certificate
market in January to boost renewables. Electricity suppliers
must get a certain portion of power from low-carbon sources or
through buying green certificates that have a tradable value.
Allowing renewable certificates to trade freely between the
nations helps them meet clean power targets at a lower cost.  “With the recent creation of the joint Swedish-Norwegian
green certificate market and the attractive wind regime, Norway
is a natural market” for NV Nordisk’s experience in developing,
financing and building wind parks, according to the statement.  HybridTech will keep a minority interest in the projects in
the Agder and Rogaland counties and help NV Nordisk develop
them, the company said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
