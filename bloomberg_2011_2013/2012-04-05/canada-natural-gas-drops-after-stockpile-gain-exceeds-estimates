Canadian natural gas fell after U.S.
inventories last week rose more than analysts anticipated.  Alberta  gas declined 4.4 percent. Stockpiles gained 42
billion cubic feet to 2.471 trillion in the week ended March 31,
61 percent above the five-year average, the  Energy Department (DOENUSCH) 
said. Inventories had been expected to increase 34 billion cubic
feet, the median of 27 estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  “The overall news for gas is bearish,” said Carl Neill, a
consultant with Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta. “Storage is
the overriding concern right now.”  Alberta gas for May delivery dropped 7.5 cents to C$1.63 a
gigajoule ($1.56 per million British thermal units) as of 2:45
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 4 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 5.2 cents, or 2.4 percent, to settle at $2.089 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
declined 5.91 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.1116 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas slid 7.03 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $1.9819 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices dropped 6.27 cents, or 3 percent, to
$2.0559.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 63 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.07 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line, at 1:30 p.m. New York time.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.88 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 703 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.94 billion cubic feet today, or 74 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
