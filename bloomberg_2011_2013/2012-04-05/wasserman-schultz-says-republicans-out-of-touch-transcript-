Democratic National Committee
Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ” airing
this weekend that Republicans have been “shockingly out of
touch” on women’s issues, and she is confident the U.S. Supreme
Court will uphold President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Debbie Wasserman Schultz joins us now from Florida. Thank you,
Madame Chairwoman. You have said that Mitt Romney is the weakest
- will be the weakest nominee in many a year, and yet actually
he’s doing better against Obama than  Bill Clinton  was doing in
’92 or then others were doing in previous elections. It’s going
to be a close election, isn’t it?  DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ : Oh, there’s no question that this
is going to be a competitive and close election. And what I
actually said was that he’s coming out of this primary as the
most unpopular potential nominee, or likely nominee, in recent
history and possibly in the history of polling.  And that’s because voters understand that throughout this
primary he has demonstrated that he’s willing to say or do
anything to get elected; he’s someone without a core, without
any convictions.  HUNT: Let me ask you about the Supreme Court decision on
the health-care law. After hearing the arguments, do you think
it’s more likely the court will overturn or uphold the law?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I’m confident that, like President Obama
said the other day, that the  Supreme Court  will ultimately
uphold the law as constitutional. Congress has the ability to
regulate commerce; that’s part of the United States
Constitution. It’s clearly impactful when somebody makes a
decision not to carry health insurance, and that decision
affects everyone all over America and increases all of our
health-care costs. That is directly commerce-related and I
believe it will be upheld.  HUNT: Some Republicans say the president stepped over the
bounds or he was foolish to say that the court, if it overturned
the law, would be engaged in judicial activism. The courts have
been overturning laws going back to Chief Justice Marshall. Was
he foolish?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: What the president was saying - and
remember, the president was a constitutional law professor
before he was president of the  United States , so he certainly
understands what the role of the Supreme Court is. But it’s not
the role of the Supreme Court, as the president said, to
overreach and to look beyond the Constitution. He believes, as I
do, that the Constitution is clear on its face and the
Affordable Care Act should be upheld.  HUNT: Tell me, size up the role that money is going to play
in this national election and which side will have the
advantage?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, Mitt Romney has been the
benefactor - the beneficiary of already tens of millions and
will ultimately be the beneficiary of hundreds of millions of
dollars in special interest money, super-PACs that are going to
dump, just like they did - he’s been doing throughout this
primary, hundreds of millions of dollars in negative attack ads.
He’s been relentless about that.  President Obama’s campaign and the  Democratic Party  is
fueled by people. We reached a million online donors six months
sooner this time, grass roots donors, than we did in the 2008
election -  HUNT: But isn’t there - there’s an Obama super-PAC -  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: He has a -  HUNT: - that will do the same thing.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Yes. There is a Priorities USA super-PAC
that I would bet probably won’t raise the hundreds of millions
of dollars that the myriad of super-PACs that exist that will
ultimately support the Republican nominee will be dumping into
this race. And that’s actually had consequences for  Mitt Romney ,
besides the fact that he will clearly be beholden to special
interests.  HUNT: You have charged that the Republicans are waging a
war on women. They say that’s nonsense; the gender gap issue
will disappear as we get closer, at least it will erode as we
get closer to the election. And then the Democrats, in fact,
have a Catholic problem.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, it’s clear in this country that
the jury of women across America have ruled, that the
Republicans have been unbelievably extreme and out of touch and
hyper-focused on cultural issues. While we are supposed to be
focusing, and should be, as President Obama has been, focused on
getting the economy turned around and continuing to move us
forward and create jobs, their side is obsessed with cultural
issues.  Mitt Romney, all he could muster as a response to  Rush
Limbaugh  calling a young woman a slut for standing up for her
belief that we should have affordable access to  birth control  in
this country was that those weren’t he words he would have
chosen.  You’ve got laws across the country, supported by Mitt
Romney, that would impose personhood amendments in state
constitutions, that would limit access to fertility treatments
for women.  You have the governor of  Pennsylvania , who said in response
to legislation that may come to his desk that would require an
ultrasound before a woman has the right to terminate her
pregnancy, that she has to look at the ultrasound and the screen
has to face her.  And Governor Corbett in Pennsylvania, all he could say was,
“Well, the woman can close her eyes. It’s not intrusive.”
That’s shockingly out of touch -  HUNT: And do you have a -  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: - and that’s why there is now an 18-
point --Hold on, Al. That’s why there’s an 18-point gender gap,
that President Obama is supported by women in this country over
Mitt Romney or any of the field by 18 points.  HUNT: Conversely, do you have a Catholic problem?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, I think on the contrary. If you look
at the support for President Obama among Catholics, among most
Americans, he’s even - as you look at the Battleground Poll that
came out a few days ago, President Obama is beating Mitt Romney
head-to-head in my state, head-to-head in battleground states
across this country.  HUNT: Madame Chairwoman, let me ask you this, because
you’re delivering conflicting messages. Is Mitt Romney a flip-
flopper who will change his positions according to what’s
popular or is he a hard-right conservative? He can’t be both.
Which is he?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, you see, that’s the problem with
Mitt Romney, is that he is willing to be anything he needs to be
at any given time. Throughout this entire primary, he has
embraced extremism. The positions that he has taken, which he
doesn’t take for very long because he changes them at a moment’s
notice, but they’ve been extreme. He’s embraced the Tea Party
ideology, supports the Ryan budget that ends Medicare as we know
it.  But then, really, you can see that Mitt Romney’s standing
in quicksand, Al. None of his positions have any conviction
because he’s willing to change them at the drop of a hat. And if
there’s anything that we need in America, it’s that we need to
have confidence that we know where our president stands, whether
we agree with them or not, especially in difficult economic
times and especially when times get tough in terms of foreign
policy.  HUNT: OK. Final, a non-presidential question. Republicans
say they are poised to take over the Senate; they’re going to
win  Virginia ,  Ohio ,  Florida ,  Wisconsin ,  Hawaii . Things are
looking very good for them to control the Senate. What’s your
take on that?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: My take is that they are living in a
fairy tale. The American people have been making it clear and
the polling recently has demonstrated that the progress that
we’ve made economically, although we have a long way to go, is
encouraging. People are feeling confident again and they want us
to work together.  And most of all, they want to support President Obama and
Democrats in Congress’s policies of helping the middle class be
successful and not just focus on people who are already doing
quite well and make sure they can do even better, which is what
Romney and the Republicans feel and my Republican colleagues in
Congress have done.  HUNT: You keep the Senate, then?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Yes. I think we hold the Senate and I
think we have the - I think we take the House back as well.  HUNT: OK. Madame Chairwoman, thank you very much and have a
happy holiday.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
