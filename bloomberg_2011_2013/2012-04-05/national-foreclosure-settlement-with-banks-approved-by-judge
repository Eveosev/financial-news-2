The $25 billion national settlement
with five banks over foreclosure practices was approved by a
federal judge, the Iowa attorney generalâ€™s office said in an
e-mail.  U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington signed
consent judgments with the banks, according to court papers. The
five banks --  Bank of America Corp. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY)  -- agreed to
standards for servicing loans and will provide mortgage relief
to homeowners.  The settlement was reached with the federal government and
49 states.  The case is U.S. v.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , 12-00361, U.S.
District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
