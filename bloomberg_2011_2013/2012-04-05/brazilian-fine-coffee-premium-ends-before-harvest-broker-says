The premium paid for “fine cup”
coffee from  Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the
commodity, ended this week with the harvest starting next month,
according to Flavour Coffee.  The beans for May and June shipments are the same as prices
on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , data from the Rio de Janeiro-
based broker show. The premium was 1 cent a pound last week.  “Good cup” coffee for May and June shipments is 10 cents
a pound below the ICE price, according to Flavour Coffee. That
compares with a discount of 11 cents a pound last week,
according to the company.  Fine and good cup coffee are the most expensive beans and
are usually exported.  Harvesting of Brazil’s 2012-13 crop is set to start next
month, according to Somar Meteorologia, a private weather
forecaster in  Sao Paulo . The crop will be a record 49 million to
52.3 million bags, exceeding the high of 48.5 million bags in
2002, according to a Jan. 10 report from Conab, the government’s
crop forecasting agency.  Arabica coffee for May delivery fell 0.7 percent to
$1.8355 a pound by 10:30 a.m. London time on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
