Youku Inc. (YOKU)  gained for the first time
in three days after the owner of  China ’s most popular online
video site received a license to offer government-authorized
content on computers, tablets and smartphones.  American depositary receipts of Youku, which plans to
acquire smaller competitor  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO)  in a stock deal
 valued  at about $893 million, rose 1.9 percent to $22.47 at
12:40 p.m. in New York after rising as much as 4.4 percent in
earlier trading. Tudou advanced 2 percent to $30.74.  China’s General Administration of Press and Publication
granted Youku the license on March 28, the Beijing-based company
said in a statement distributed by PRNewswire today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
