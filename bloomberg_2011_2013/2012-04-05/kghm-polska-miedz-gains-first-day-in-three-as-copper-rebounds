KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , Poland’s sole
copper miner, gained for the first day in three as a report
showed the job market in the U.S., the world’s second-biggest
consumer of the copper, improved.  The shares rose as much as 1.1 percent to 142.5 zloty, and
traded 0.6 percent stronger at 3:28 p.m. in Warsaw. Claims for
U.S. unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level
in four years, adding to recent reports showing signs of health
in the economy. The three-month contract for copper rose 0.4
percent to $8,379 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
