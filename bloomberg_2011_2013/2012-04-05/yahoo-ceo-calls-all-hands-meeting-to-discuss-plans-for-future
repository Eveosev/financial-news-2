Yahoo (YHOO) ! Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Scott Thompson , who announced about 2,000 job cuts yesterday,
called an all-hands meeting for next week to discuss the
company’s plans, including ways to speed innovation.  The meeting will include Thompson and other company
executives, Thompson wrote in a staff memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. Thompson, whose cuts will affect about 14 percent of
 Yahoo (YHOO) ’s staff, said he deliberately delayed the meeting out of
respect for those employees who will lose their jobs.  “There’s a lot to do and that’s why I can’t stress enough
that we all need to focus on getting stuff done,” he said.
“Getting stuff done is short hand for eliminating bureaucracy
and barriers so we can all innovate as fast as our customers and
the industry require. That’s pretty fast.”  Thompson, who took over as CEO in January, is trying to
drive a turnaround at a company that’s lagged competitors such
as  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG)  Yahoo will focus on core
businesses such as media and communications, he said yesterday
in a separate letter to employees that was obtained by Bloomberg
News.  The companywide meeting comes after investor Third Point
LLC, which is planning a proxy fight, faulted Yahoo for
embarking on the job cuts without having articulated a more
complete strategy.  Yahoo (YHOO) , based in Sunnyvale, California, fell 1.3 percent
today to $15.07 at 4 p.m. New York time. The shares have
declined 6.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
