Taiwan’s dollar fell the most in
almost four weeks and  government bonds  rose after the stock
exchange signaled plans to impose a capital-gains tax on share
transactions.  The currency weakened 0.2 percent to NT$29.53 per dollar at
9:16 a.m. Taipei time as the TWSE index slumped 2.3 percent. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond fell one basis
point to 1.27 percent.  “The  Taiwan dollar  is falling because the stock market is
lower,” said Tarsico Tong, a currency trader at  Union Bank of
Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. “The government is talking about imposing
the capital-gains tax.”  Losses in the Taiwan dollar may halt at NT$29.60 as
exporters will probably sell U.S. dollars at this
level, Tong said. At NT$29.45, importers would buy the
greenback, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
