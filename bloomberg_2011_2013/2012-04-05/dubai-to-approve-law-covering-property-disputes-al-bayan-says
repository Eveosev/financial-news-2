Dubai will soon approve a law
creating a legal committee to speed up resolution of disputes
among homeowners’ associations, property owners and developers,
 Al Bayan  reported, citing Sultan Butti bin Mejrin, the director-
general of the Land Department.  Disputes are frequently lodged with Dubai’s land department
and since most of them involve money, settlement normally
involves resorting to legal process, the newspaper cited bin
Mejrin as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
