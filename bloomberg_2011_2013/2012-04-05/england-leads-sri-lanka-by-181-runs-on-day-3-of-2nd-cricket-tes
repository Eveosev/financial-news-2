Kevin Pietersen ’s 151 pushed England
to a 181-run lead over Sri Lanka as the visitors try to tie the
two-match series in Colombo.  England was all out for 460 this afternoon, with Pietersen
and Ian Bell combining for 94 runs for the fourth wicket.
Rangara Herath took 6-133, including trapping Pietersen leg-
before-wicket, to lead the Sri Lankan attack.  Sri Lanka was 4-0 at the end of the day.  Alastair Cook, on 94, was the only batsman to get out in
the morning session after England resumed at 154-1 in reply to
Sri Lanka’s first-innings of 275.  Jonathan Trott  was caught off
Herath on 64.  Opener Cook edged a turning delivery from  Tillakaratne
Dilshan  to Mahela Jayawardene at slip when six runs short of his
20th Test century.  England must win at the P. Sara Oval to retain the No. 1
Test ranking after losing the first Test by 75 runs. South
Africa will take the top spot should England fail to beat Sri
Lanka, which is seeking its first Test series victory since
August 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
