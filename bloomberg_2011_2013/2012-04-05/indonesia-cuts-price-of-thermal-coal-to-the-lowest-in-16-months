Indonesia, the world’s largest
exporter of power-station coal, cut the  benchmark  price for
April sales to the lowest in 16 months, according to data
released by the energy ministry.  Coal (CLSPAUNE)  with a gross heating value of 6,322 kilo-calories per
kilogram cost $105.61 a ton on a free-on-board basis, down about
6.4 percent from $112.87 a ton in March, the Directorate General
of Coal and Minerals at the ministry said today in a statement
on its  website . It was the lowest price since December 2010,
according to the ministry’s data.  Below is a list of price references and markers used to
calculate prices for coal of similar quality from eight grades
in Indonesia as compiled by the energy ministry. Grades are in
kilo-calories a kilogram, and prices are in U.S. dollars a ton.  Note: Percentage changes are calculated by Bloomberg News. The
price reference is an average of the  Indonesia  Coal Index,
Platts-1, Newcastle Export Index and the globalCOAL NEWC Index
from the previous month. The average of the price reference for
the last three months is used to set prices for a one-year
contract for the following year. For sales in barges, the
reference price excludes the cost of barging and transshipment
into the vessel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
