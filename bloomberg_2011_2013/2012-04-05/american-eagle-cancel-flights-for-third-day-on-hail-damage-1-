American Airlines  and regional
partner American Eagle will scrap almost 300 more flights
tomorrow as plane inspections and repairs drag into a fourth day
after a hailstorm at  Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport .  The 296 planned cancellations will push the total to more
than 1,900 since a weather system spun off several  tornadoes 
that raked the Dallas area about noon on April 3. Some flights
are being added in other markets to move stranded passengers,
 Andrea Huguely , a spokeswoman, said today by e-mail.  “It will be several more days” before flight schedules to
and from D/FW return to normal, Huguely said earlier in an
interview. “It really depends on what the damage is to the
aircraft, how much repair has to be done.”  Tomorrow’s cancellations underscored the scope of the
disruptions from hail at D/FW airport, which is American’s
largest hub. Huguely said 55 planes remain out of  service , down
from 101 earlier in the week, after some sustained “fairly
significant damage” from hail.  Cancellations today totaled 323, Huguely said. American,
the third-biggest U.S. airline, and Eagle are units of Fort
Worth-based  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)   To contact the reporter on this story:
