HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, said commercial banking chief Sandy Flockhart will step
down after 37 years at the company.  Flockhart, 60, will stay on as a non-executive director and
chairman of the bank’s U.K. and European unit, the London-based
lender said in a statement today.  He joined the bank in 1974 and went on to serve as chief
executive officer of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., HSBC’s
Hong Kong operation. He became director of commercial banking,
which generates about a third of HSBC’s pretax profit, in
February 2010.  “He retires at a point in time when commercial banking,
the business with which he has been most associated, is the
largest profit contributor to the group,” Chairman  Douglas Flint  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
