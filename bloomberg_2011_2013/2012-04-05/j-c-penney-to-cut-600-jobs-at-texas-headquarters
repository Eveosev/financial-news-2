J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , the fourth-largest
U.S. department-store company, is cutting about 600 jobs at its
headquarters as Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson  remakes the
retailer.  The job cuts represent about 15 percent of the staff at the
office in Plano,  Texas , Darcie Brossart, a spokeswoman, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The changes are part of a plan
announced in January to cut annual costs by about $900 million
by the end of 2013, including $200 million in savings from
headquarters, the company said today in a statement.  Johnson, who took over in November after leading Apple
Inc.’s retail business, is seeking to revive sales by
simplifying pricing into three tiers and reconfiguring stores
into a collection of branded shops surrounding a “Town
Square.” The changes at the headquarters are intended to make
J.C. Penney run more like a start-up company, he said today.  “Simplicity is one of the guiding principals of our
transformation,” Johnson said today in the statement.  J.C. Penney fell 1.9 percent to $34.97 at the close in  New
York . The  shares  have dropped 0.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
