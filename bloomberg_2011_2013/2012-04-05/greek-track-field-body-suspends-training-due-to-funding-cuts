Greece ’s track and field federation
suspended training due to “unfair and selective” cuts in state
funding in 2011 and 2012, according to a statement posted on the
Segas association’s website.  Segas, which was founded in 1897 and has 30,000 athletes,
called on Culture and Tourism Minister Pavlos Yeroulanos to
intervene. The board will meet again in the following days to
decide on its next steps, the Athens-based body said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
