(Corrects subscriber losses in last paragraph.)  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  Chief
Executive Officer James Dolan’s 2011 compensation fell to $11.4
million as the company’s shares tumbled 40 percent.  Dolan’s compensation is 15 percent lower than 2010 and 33
percent lower than 2009, the company today said in a filing.
Cablevision’s shares dropped after it spun off  AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX) 
in June and aggressively discounted against Verizon
Communications Inc.’s FiOS, hurting profit.  Dolan took over operational responsibilities for the fifth-
largest cable operator in 2012 after Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge left to take the CEO role at  Charter Communications
Inc. (CHTR)  in December. Rutledge made $23.2 million in 2011 and $28.2
million in 2010.  Bethpage, New York-based Cablevision’s earnings excluding
one-time items missed analysts’ estimates in the second and
third quarters. The company lost 64,000 video customers in 2011,
according to year-end reports.  Dolan is also chairman of  Madison Square Garden Co. (MSG)   To contact the reporter on this story:
