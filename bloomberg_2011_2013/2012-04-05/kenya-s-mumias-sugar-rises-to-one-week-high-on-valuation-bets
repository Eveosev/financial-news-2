Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, closed unchanged, after reaching a
one-week high as investors speculated the share’s performance
lagged behind the stock market and made it attractive.  The stock climbed as much as 3.2 percent to 4.80 shillings
and closed trading unchanged at 4.65 shillings as of 3 p.m. in
the capital, Nairobi. The volume of shares traded was 336
percent of the three-month moving average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “What you are seeing is value investors looking to pick up
the stock because the long term story remains positive and it is
an underperformer in a market compared to the index,” Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Nairobi-based investment
company  Rich Management , said in a phone interview today.  Year to date the benchmark  NSE 20-share index  has gained
6.4 percent, while Mumias has fallen 12 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
