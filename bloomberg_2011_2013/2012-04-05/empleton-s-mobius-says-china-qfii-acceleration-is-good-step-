Mark Mobius , who oversees more than
$40 billion as Singapore-based executive chairman of  Franklin
Templeton ’s Emerging Markets Group, comments on China’s efforts
to accelerate the opening of its  capital markets . He spoke to
the media in Bangkok after a conference.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission increased the
quotas for qualified foreign institutional investors to $80
billion from $30 billion, according to a statement on its
website on April 3.  On China’s additional foreign investment:  “The amount is still too small. There is also a
restriction that you have to invest for at least a year. Our
fund is an open-ended fund. Anytime people want the money back,
we have to give that to them. We can’t do that with  China 
because money has to be locked up for one year. However, it’s a
good step for Chinese development.  ‘‘The Chinese government wants to put more money in the
hands of its population. The largest investors in the Chinese
stock market are individuals, not institutions. This is one way
for the Chinese government to put money into the hands of the
individuals by pushing up the stock market.”  On Templeton applying for additional quota:  “We do have some quota. I’m not sure yet if we will apply
for more. We already have exposure to Chinese equities through
the Hong Kong market, the H shares and B shares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
