OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, plans to develop two blocks with  Vietnam 
Oil & Gas Group off the coast of the Asian nation.  Gazprom will take 49 percent of the project with
PetroVietnam, as the state-owned company is known, to develop
the 05.2 and 05.3 blocks, the Russian gas producer said today in
an e-mailed statement. The partners will work under a
production-sharing agreement, Gazprom said.  PetroVietnam and Gazprom are already  working together 
exploring for oil and gas offshore Vietnam, the country that has
been  Russia ’s ally since the Soviet era.  The two blocks in the  South China Sea  cover two discovered
gas and condensate fields, Moc Tinh and Hai Thach, with total
reserves of 55.6 billion cubic meters of gas and 25.1 million
tons of condensate, Gazprom said. There is also an oil field at
one of the blocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
