The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings climbed 4.25 basis points to 133.75 at
3:30 p.m. in  London , JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices show. The gauge
is up from 125 basis points March 30 and heading for the biggest
weekly increase since Dec. 16.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings jumped 13 basis
points to 650, and is set for a third weekly rise. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 8.5 basis points to 235 and the
subordinated index was 11 higher at 383.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
