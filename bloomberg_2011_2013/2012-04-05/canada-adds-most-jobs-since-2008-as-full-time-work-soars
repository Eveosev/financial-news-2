Canada added the most  jobs  since
September 2008 last month, a gain dominated by full-time
positions that revived what had been a stalling labor market in
the world’s 10th largest economy.  Employment rose by 82,300 following a decline of 2,800 in
February,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa, lowering the
 jobless rate  to 7.2 percent from 7.4 percent. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 10,500 gain in jobs and
7.4 percent unemployment, according to the median forecasts.  Employment growth should add to household spending that the
 Bank of Canada  said last month has been rising faster than
expected. Governor  Mark Carney  said in an April 2 speech that
high household debt loads and sluggish exports remain major
risks to the expansion, and he has kept his  key lending rate  at
1 percent since September 2010 to boost demand.  “This was a blockbuster report,” said Mazen Issa, Canada
macro strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. “There could be a
slight tinge of hawkishness” in the central bank’s next
interest-rate announcement on April 17, he said.  Canada’s dollar strengthened 0.3 percent to 99.36 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 4:28 p.m in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0066. Canada’s benchmark  2-year bond  fell, with the yield
rising 4 basis points to 1.26 percent.  There were also signs of labor-market strength in the U.S.
today, which buys three-quarters of Canada’s exports. Claims for
U.S. unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level
in four years, the Labor Department said today in  Washington ,
while the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index reached a four-year
high.  Full-Time Gains  Full-time employment in Canada jumped by 70,000 in March
while part-time positions grew by 12,400, Statistics Canada
said. About 42,600 jobs were created by private companies and
20,900 in the public sector.  Health care and social assistance employment rose by 31,500
in March, followed by a gain of 28,300 for information, culture
and recreation firms. Manufacturing rose by 11,800, the fourth
consecutive increase.  Toyota Motor Corp. said March 28 it would add about 400 new
jobs at a Woodstock, Ontario, factory to increase its production
capacity of RAV4 model vehicles.  “The momentum in the economy is stronger than previously
thought and we are better able to weather these external
shocks,” said  Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist at Royal
Bank of Canada in Toronto. “We had been seeing no growth in
jobs so far this year, which raised concerns,” and today’s
report may lead the central bank to raise rates sooner, he said.  Wage Gains  Average hourly  earnings  of permanent employees rose 2.5
percent in March from a year earlier, faster than the prior
reading of 2.1 percent. The Bank of Canada says that figure is a
key indicator of inflation.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose
by 63,600 while the self-employed rose by 18,800 in March.  Public administration work rose by 15,000 positions in
March, Statistics Canada said.  The largest job loss by industry in March was a 24,600
decline for educational services.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty ’s budget last week showed
plans for 19,200 federal government job cuts, or 4.8 percent of
the total, to help eliminate the  budget deficit . About 7,200 of
those reductions will come through expected attrition.  Risks to Recovery  Policy makers will recognize that today’s report won’t be
repeated and “it still remains a fragile recovery” in part
because of lingering risks in  Europe , Issa at TD Securities
said.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said April 4 that his
country is in “extreme difficulty” and signaled that budget
cuts would be less painful than a bailout. The country’s  jobless
rate  of 23.6 percent is the  highest  in the European Union and
Rajoy’s budget seeks spending reductions to cut 3.2 percentage
points from a budget shortfall that was 8.5 percent of output
last year.  Today was the first time Statistics  Canada  released its
jobs report at 8:30 a.m., rather than 7 a.m., a move that
standardizes publication times.  In a separate report, the agency said  building permits  rose
7.5 percent in February to C$6.51 billion ($6.52 billion),
faster than the 2 percent gain economists forecast. Non-
residential permits jumped 36.2 percent to C$2.54 billion while
residential permits fell 5.3 percent to C$3.97 billion.  The U.S. may report tomorrow that payrolls increased by
205,000 in March with unemployment unchanged at 8.3 percent,
according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
