Russia’s former Deputy Finance
Minister Andrei Vavilov may become the country’s first
businessman to create an exchange-traded fund backed by physical
gold supplies,  RBC Daily  said.  Vavilov plans to deposit gold bullion in Zurich or London
banks and trade the derivatives on them on the Irish stock
exchange and Moscow’s Micex-RTS exchange, the newspaper said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
