Brazil  may be the world's soccer capital, but as the country gears up to host the World Cup in 2014, a war of words between the government and FIFA, soccer's ruling body, just keeps intensifying. The hostilities have followed a predictable pattern: FIFA criticizes Brazil for being behind with preparations; Brazil gets in a huff; FIFA apologizes. Then it starts all over again. In the latest round, FIFA Secretary General  Jerome Valcke   caused a storm  when he said that Brazil needed a "kick up the backside." Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said the secretary general should be removed from his post. Marco Aurelio Garcia, a foreign-policy adviser to Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff , exclaimed:"This guy is a vagabond!" Valcke described the Brazilian reaction as "puerile." Then he apologized, blaming a mistranslation. The Senate has since  refused to meet  with him for a scheduled hearing. FIFA President  Sepp Blatter   visited Rousseff  and seemed to make peace. Then Blatter fired a salvo of his own as he welcomed the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies' belated passing of its World Cup Bill, which defines the legal framework for the event. "We want actions, not just more words,"  Blatter said . He was referring to increasingly worrisome delays in Brazil's public-works plans for the tournament. Eight of the 12 stadiums being built are less than halfway done, according to the Sports Ministry. Infrastructure is in a worse state,  noted the Carta Capital magazine : Seventeen of Brazil’s biggest airports operated above capacity last year, the magazine said, and 10 of the 13 terminals needed for the  World Cup  won't be ready by 2014 -- or, if they are, will be opened with lower capacity than expected. The business daily Valor  recently published a study  showing that from September to January, 19 World Cup-related projects were behind schedule or had already been abandoned. The federal agency that finances most projects  has approved  just $106 million of the $2.89 billion requested by states and municipalities for improvements. The Brazilian blogosphere is concluding that Blatter had a point. "Blatter is right to demand!!!" exclaimed the headline on the  Blog do Neto , written by Jose Ferreira Neto, a former soccer star and one of the country's leading commentators. Jose Roberto Bernasconi, the president of Sinaenco-SP, a Sao Paulo architecture and engineering trade group, said in an interview with Agencia Brasil that the country was  missing a great opportunity  -- especially given the demand for new transportation systems and hotels to accommodate the 600,000 foreign tourists and 1.1 million Brazilians  expected to travel  during the World Cup. Senator Pedro Taques from the Democratic Labor Party was  quick to play the nationalist card . "This is not a  banana republic ," Taques declared, according to Agencia Brasil. "The administration made commitments, but that does not mean compromising our sovereignty. I will not make a deal with the devil to do the work of God." Journalist Mary Zaidan  argued against such displays  of bruised national pride on the O Globo newspaper's Blog do Noblat: The sale of alcohol at World Cup games has been a  major sticking point . It's illegal in Brazil to sell booze at soccer stadiums, but FIFA has demanded an exemption for the Cup to satisfy its beer sponsors. Former President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  allegedly agreed to allow it during negotiations with FIFA in 2007. (The  World Cup Bill  passed by the Chamber of Deputies didn't fully resolve the issue; the bill now goes to the Senate.) The larger point was that the debate over preparedness has been diverted because Brazil's fragile national pride has been wounded. The stigma of what Brazilians call the "complexo de vira-lata," or the "mongrel complex," still runs strong, and the phrase, often attributed to  Charles de Gaulle , that "Brazil is not a serious country" still stings. But less noticed in the media storm that surrounded Blatter's comment, the FIFA chief had  sounded a more positive, if resigned, note . "I am optimistic. There are always problems with hotels; the situation is not perfect," he said. "It was the same in  South Africa  in certain cities. But this is not going to prevent supporters from going to Brazil."
