Ethanol advanced in  Chicago  on
concern that tight supplies of corn will lead to higher
production costs.  Futures followed corn prices, which have risen 2.2 percent
since a March 30 Agriculture Department report showed stockpiles
of the grain at an eight-year low.  “That correlation is still intact,” said Mike Blackford,
a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “If you want
to hedge that ethanol you have to keep those two in tandem.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery climbed 0.9 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $2.284 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.33 a gallon, while on the West Coast the additive declined
3 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.39, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents to $2.245 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell 0.5 cent to $2.31.  Corn futures for May delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
$6.5825 a bushel in Chicago, snapping a two-week decline. The
CBOT will be closed tomorrow for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
