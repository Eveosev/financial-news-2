German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  is seeking the backing of states for a tax agreement
with  Switzerland  by offering them a larger share of the
proceeds,  WirtschaftsWoche  magazine reported.  Following the signing of a revised agreement today that
would fight  tax evasion  by German nationals, Schaeuble will face
difficult negotiations with the states, whose support he needs,
the magazine said, citing Finance Ministry officials it didn’t
identify.  Schaeuble plans to keep 30.8 percent from a retroactive
recovery of taxes evaded by German nationals and give 60.8
percent to the 16 states and 8.4 percent to municipalities, the
magazine said, citing unpublished ministry calculations.  From future proceeds, 44 percent each would go to the
federal government and the states while municipalities would
receive 12 percent, the magazine said. Schaeuble is ready to
increase the states’ share to let the agreement go into force as
planned on Jan. 1, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
