Palm-oil  reserves in  Malaysia , the
second-biggest supplier after  Indonesia , probably declined to
the lowest level in seven months in March as exports outpaced
growth in production, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Stockpiles (PASTTOTL)  fell 2.4 percent to 2.01 million metric tons,
from 2.06 million tons in February, according to the median of
estimates in the survey of four analysts and two plantation
companies. Inventories are expected to be 25 percent higher than
a year earlier, the survey showed. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board
is scheduled to release the estimate on April 10.  Prices gained 12 percent this year on concerns global
cooking-oil supplies will drop after drought reduced soybean
harvests in  Brazil  and  Argentina  and as U.S. farmers plant fewer
acres of the oilseed crushed to make soybean oil, a substitute
of palm oil in food and fuels. Lower stockpiles may help palm-
 oil prices  rally even higher, potentially raising profits for
Malaysian companies including  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  and IOI Corp.  “Production is slightly lower than export growth,” Hoe Lee Leng, an analyst at RHB Capital Bhd., said by phone in Kuala
Lumpur yesterday. Rising imports from Indonesia were a “skewing
factor” in keeping stockpiles in Malaysia above the 2-million
ton level, she said.  A cut in export taxes for refined palm oil and olein in
Indonesia last year made it cheaper for Malaysian producers of
oleochemicals, or specialty fats, to buy from the country, the
biggest supplier, said Hoe. Total imports rose to 246,419 tons
in February from 209,408 tons in January, board data showed.  Output Climbs  Malaysia’s  output  advanced 4.2 percent to 1.24 million tons
in March, the first gain in five months, from 1.19 million tons
in February, the survey showed.  Shipments (ITSPALM)  rose 4.8 percent to
1.23 million tons after a 10.5 percent drop in February,
surveyor  Intertek (ITSPALM)  said on March 31. Exports climbed 4.1 percent
to 1.26 million tons, according to the median of the survey.  Exports recovered as “soybean supplies look tight, while
post-winter demand kicks in,”  Ben Santoso , an analyst with DBS
Vickers Securities (Singapore) Pte., said in an e-mail.  World output of soybeans may drop to 242.9 million tons in
2012, including a cut of 16 million tons in South American
production, Thomas Mielke, executive director of Oil World, said
March 26. Palm oil clouds in cooler weather, leading to a
seasonal drop in exports during the winter months.  The June-delivery contract was little changed at 3,553
ringgit ($1,158) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at
5:45 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. Futures reached 3,574 ringgit a ton
yesterday, the highest price for the most-active contract since
March 9, 2011.  The price may jump to 4,000 ringgit by the end of June on
declining global vegetable-oil stockpiles,  Dorab Mistry ,
director of Godrej International Ltd., said March 27,
reiterating an earlier forecast. Global production of palm oil
will increase by 2 million tons this marketing year compared
with a 5.5-million ton gain in 2010-2011, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
