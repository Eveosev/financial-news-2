Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped the most
in two weeks, erasing earlier gains, on speculation importers
took advantage of a more favorable exchange rate to buy dollars.  The rupiah earlier appreciated as much as 0.6 percent to
reach 9,090 per dollar, the highest level in five weeks. A
stronger local currency lowers the cost of overseas purchases.
Overseas investors sold $51 million more of local stocks than
they bought yesterday, exchange data show.  “The rupiah can’t strengthen too sharply, considering we
see much demand for dollars from importing companies that need
to make payments,” said Gusti Kahari, a foreign-exchange dealer
at PT Bank Artha Graha Internasional in Jakarta.  The rupiah declined 0.3 percent to 9,171 per dollar as of
4:59 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest loss since March 22.
The currency fell 0.1 percent for the week. Local financial
markets are closed tomorrow for a public holiday.  One-month implied volatility, which measures  exchange-rate 
swings used to price options, held at 6.75 percent. The measure
reached 6.50 percent on April 3, the lowest level since Sept. 9.  The central bank will continue to monitor and intervene in
the foreign-exchange and bond markets to stabilize the rupiah,
according to a  note  posted on its website on March 8.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.91
percent, according to final prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
