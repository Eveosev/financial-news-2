Greece  will exchange 20.3 billion
euros ($26.7 billion) of foreign-law bonds on April 11 as it
moves a step closer to wrapping up the biggest sovereign
restructuring in history.  The deadline for investors still holding out in the 206
billion-euro debt exchange was extended a second time, with the
offer being kept open until April 20, according to a statement
on the Greek Finance Ministry’s  website . Those foreign-law bonds
with the extended deadline will be exchanged on April 25, the
ministry said in the statement.  The government on March 9 used collective-action clauses on
Greek-law bonds to bring the participation rate to 95.7 percent
of eligible securities. Investors holding the remaining bonds
were given until March 23 to decide whether to participate,
before that deadline was extended to 10 p.m. Athens time
yesterday.  “There will be no better offer” for holders of bonds
issued under international law, government spokesman Pantelis
Kapsis told reporters yesterday. Investors participating in the
exchange will take a 53.5 percent reduction in the face value of
their securities.  In 20 out of 36 general meetings for foreign-law
bondholders, the creditors rejected the government’s proposal,
adjourned the talks or failed to achieve a quorum, according to
a  press release  from the Greek Public Debt Management Agency on
April 2.  Holders of a 450 million-euro floating-rate note that falls
due on May 15, the closest maturity among the international
bonds, rejected the restructuring deal, according to the April 2
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
