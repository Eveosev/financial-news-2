TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , the Nordic region’s
second-largest phone company, exited  Cambodia  and agreed to
raise its stake in a unit in Nepal, part of a plan to focus on
emerging markets where it’s one of the market leaders.  TeliaSonera sold its 18.6 percent stake in Cambodia’s Smart
Mobile to Latelz Co. Ltd., spokeswoman  Cecilia Edstroem  said by
phone. The company will acquire an additional 12.4 percent stake
in its Nepalese Ncell unit if a law is changed to permit higher
foreign ownership, she also said.  “Cambodia is a highly competitive market and as our
strategy is to become number one or two in each market, we
decided in 2010 we would reduce our ownership,” Edstroem said.  TeliaSonera bought stakes in wireless companies in Cambodia
and Nepal from Kazakhstan-based Visor Group for $484 million in
2008. The Swedish company sought wireless growth in  emerging
markets  to counter slowing growth at home. It paid $160 million
for an additional stake in 2010, at the same time selling part
of the Cambodian holding to Latelz and acquiring the right to
increase its holding in Nepal to 72.9 percent.  TeliaSonera currently owns 60.4 percent of Ncell in Nepal,
it said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
