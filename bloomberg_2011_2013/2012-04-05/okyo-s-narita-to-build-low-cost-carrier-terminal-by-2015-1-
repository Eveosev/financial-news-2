Tokyo ’s  Narita airport  will build a
terminal targeting low-cost airlines by 2015 as Jetstar Japan
Co. and AirAsia Japan Co. are set to start flights this year
from the nation’s busiest international hub.  The airport will build the facility north of Terminal 2 and
will accept international low-cost carrier flights at Terminal 2
in the meantime, state-owned  Narita International Airport Corp. 
said in a statement in Tokyo today. Domestic flights will be
accepted at a temporary facility near Terminal 2, it said.  The hub, which opened Tokyo’s first dedicated business-jet
terminal last week, is adding capacity to lure airlines as it
competes with airports in Seoul, Beijing and  Hong Kong , where
landing fees are about half the price or less. The airport,
about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from downtown Tokyo, is also
competing with Haneda airport, located near the heart of the
city, which is also adding capacity after opening a new runway
in 2010.  Jetstar Japan, backed by Japan Airlines Co. and  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN) ’s Jetstar, will begin flights from Narita in July
and is targeting 100 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in annual sales
within a few years. The carrier, also partly owned by  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058) , is considering expanding its fleet to 100 planes by the
end of the decade.  AirAsia Japan, a venture between  All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  and
 AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , is due to start flights from Tokyo’s Narita
airport in August. The carrier has predicted 10 million
passengers annually in five years.  Narita charges $5,632 in landing fees and other costs for
handling an Airbus SAS A320 with a three-hour turnaround,
according to International Air Transport Association data.
Seoul’s Incheon costs $2,983, Beijing charges $2,149 and Hong
Kong is $1,807, according to the IATA.  Narita last month boosted total annual capacity to 250,000
takeoffs and landings a year from 235,000. That will rise to
270,000 by the end of March 2013, Kosaburo Morinaka, Narita
Airport’s president, said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
