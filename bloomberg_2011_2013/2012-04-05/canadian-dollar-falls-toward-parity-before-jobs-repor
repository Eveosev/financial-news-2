Canada ’s dollar weakened for a third
day as concern European’s debt crisis will weigh on global
growth drove investors to the safety of its U.S. counterpart
before a report forecast to show the nation added jobs.  Canada’s dollar advanced against the 17-nation common
currency, which dropped against most of its 16 major peers as
borrowing costs in France and Spain rose. Employers added 10,500
jobs to payrolls last month, according to the median of 24
forecasts compiled by Bloomberg News.  “Our core view is still for modest  U.S. dollar 
appreciation,” said  Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS
AG, by phone from London. He said the result of higher risk-
aversion and the decline in stocks is selling of commodity
currencies such as the Canadian dollar against the greenback.
“The focus is still on Spain,” he said.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, dropped 0.2
percent to 99.87 cents per U.S. dollar at 7:43 a.m. in Toronto.
It lost as much as 0.4 percent to 99.98 cents, the lowest level
this week. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0012.  Statistics Canada  will release the jobs report at 8:30 a.m.
in Ottawa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
