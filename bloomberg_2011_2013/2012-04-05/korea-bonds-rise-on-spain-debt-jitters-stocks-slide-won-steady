South Korea ’s bonds rose after weak
demand at a Spanish securities auction fanned concern  Europe ’s
debt crisis will worsen. The won gained, reversing an earlier
decline, as stocks rebounded from a three-week low.  Spain sold 2.59 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds
yesterday, less than its maximum target of 3.5 billion euros,
and Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the country is facing an
economic situation of “extreme difficulty.” Asian  equities 
pared losses after China said it will more than double the
amount foreigners can invest in the country’s stocks. The  Kospi
Index (KOSPI)  of shares advanced 0.5 percent.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.55
percent in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year
debt futures declined 0.02 percentage point to 103.75 and one-
year interest-rate swaps were little changed at 3.55 percent.  “With weak results at Spain’s debt auction reigniting
concern over Europe’s debt crisis, preference for safety assets
has strengthened in the market,” Ryan Oh, a Seoul-based fixed-
income analyst at Samsung Securities Co, said in an e-mailed
note to clients.  The won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,127.26 per dollar,
after falling as much as 0.2 percent earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility for the won,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell
eight basis points to 8.05 percent.  Overseas funds raised their holdings of South Korean bonds
by 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in March to a record 88.5
trillion won, according to data released yesterday by the
financial regulator. South Korea’s economy is facing downside
risks because of high  oil prices , Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
