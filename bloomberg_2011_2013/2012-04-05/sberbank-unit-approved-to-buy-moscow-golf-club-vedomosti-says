OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, got state approval for its unit to acquire as much as
100 percent of the shares in Moscow Golf Club,  Vedomosti 
reported, citing documents by the country’s antitrust watchdog.  The club was established in 1987 when Swedish ice-hockey
player Sven Tumba persuaded President  Mikhail Gorbachev  to help
promote golf in the USSR, the newspaper said. The current
owners, including the Moscow city government and Tumba’s family,
are seeking to sell the club, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
