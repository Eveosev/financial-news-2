Consumer prices in Ecuador, which
uses the  U.S. dollar  as its official currency, rose at their
fastest pace in three years in March, increasing pressure on the
government to use price controls to hold down costs.  Prices rose 0.9 percent from February, when they gained
0.78 percent, the National Statistics and Census Institute said
on its  website . Annual inflation accelerated to 6.1 percent from
5.5 percent, while producer prices increased 0.93 percent from
the month before and 3.7 percent from March 2011, the report
said.  Food prices rose 8.15 percent from a year ago as record
rainfall in coastal areas damaged crops and disrupted supplies,
according to the country’s meteorological institute. Costs
should decline after the country’s wet season ends, Economic
Policy Minister Jeannette Sanchez said last month. If not, the
government is prepared to broaden price controls, she said.  “If the hard season of rain that’s affecting the coast
moderates in the coming weeks, we could expect the inflation
rate to remain near its actual levels for the next six months,”
former Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga wrote in a March 20
report.  Prices rose the fastest in the highland city of Ambato,
jumping 1.46 percent in March from the previous month. In
Guayaquil, the nation’s largest city, prices climbed 1.19
percent.  Ecuador , the smallest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, subsidizes fuel costs and the
domestic use of natural gas.  The inflation rate is forecast to average 5.14 percent this
year, compared with 4.7 percent in 2011, while the economy may
expand 5.35 percent, according to the  Finance Ministry ’s 2012
budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
