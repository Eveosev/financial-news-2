Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the  Hang
Seng Index (HSI)  headed for its fifth decline in six days, as weaker
demand for Spanish bonds at an auction renewed concern  Europe 
will struggle to contain its debt crisis and Premier Wen Jiabao
vowed to break the monopoly of big banks.  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13) , an operator of ports in Spain and
Germany, decreased 2.1 percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by market value, slipped
1.6 percent. Zijin Mining Group Co.,  China ’s largest gold
producer, dropped 1.9 percent as bullion dropped to a 12-week
low yesterday.  “Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is still a concern,” said
Michiya Tomita, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ
Asset Management Co., which oversees $65 billion. “The pullback
is not surprising as the market has rallied a lot in the first
quarter.”  The  Hang Seng  Index declined 1 percent to 20,593 as of the
4 p.m. close in Hong Kong, with three shares declining for each
that rose in the 48-member gauge. Volume on the measure was
about 10 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark index gained 0.2 percent this holiday-
shortened week. The market will be shut tomorrow and on April 9
for the Easter weekend. The Hang Seng dropped the last two weeks
as earnings that missed estimates from companies including
Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. triggered concern growth in the
world’s second-largest economy is slowing.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland companies
decreased 1.1 percent to 10,744.91, snapping a three-day advance.
The Shanghai Composite Index recorded its biggest advance in
almost two months after the government said it will more than
double the amount foreigners can invest in equities, bonds and
 bank deposits .  Spain Debt Auction  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today after the gauge sank 1 percent in New York
yesterday after SanDisk Corp.’s lower forecast dragged down
technology shares and as Spain struggled to borrow in financial
markets.  Companies that do business in Europe declined after Spain
sold 2.6 billion euros ($3.4 billion) of bonds at an auction
yesterday, an amount that was near the bottom of a range set for
the sale. Spain’s situation is one of “extreme difficulty,”
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said yesterday.  Hutchison Whampoa slid 2.1 percent to HK$76.10.  Cosco
Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates a port in Greece, slipped 1.4
percent to HK$11.42.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest lender
by market value, fell 1.2 percent to HK$68.75.  China Banks Fall  Chinese lenders declined after Premier Wen said the nation
needs to break a banking monopoly of a few big lenders that make
easy profits because it’s hard to borrow money elsewhere. The
country can expand nationwide a pilot program in Zhejiang
province that allows private financing, including non-bank
lending, Wen said on April 3, as quoted by China National Radio.  ICBC, as the mainland’s largest bank is also known, slid
1.6 percent to HK$5.03.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
second-biggest lender, fell 2 percent to HK$6.  Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd. (1288)  dropped 2.6 percent to HK$3.33.  Gold producers declined as bullion traded near a 12-week
low after sliding 1.5 percent yesterday. Zijin Mining declined
1.9 percent to HK$3.05. Zhaojin Mining Industry Co. decreased
3.2 percent to HK$12.30.  The Hang Seng Index climbed 12 percent in the first quarter
as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering fueled confidence in
exporters. The rally boosted the value of stocks on the gauge to
10.5 times  estimated earnings  as of April 3. That compares with
13.4 times for the S&P 500 and 10.7 times for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index expiring this month fell 1.2
percent to 20,522. The HSI Volatility Index jumped 7.3 percent
to 19.89, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 5.7
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
