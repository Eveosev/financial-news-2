Brazil â€™s government may introduce
further measures to boost the economy by December if it finds
that those adopted so far are insufficient to guarantee its
targeted growth rate of 4.5 percent this year,  O Globo  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Further measures could include reducing taxes for a wider
range of industry sectors and extending credit lines for
exporters, according to the Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
