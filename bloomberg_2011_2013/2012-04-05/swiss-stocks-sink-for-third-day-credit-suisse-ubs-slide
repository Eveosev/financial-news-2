Swiss stocks  were little changed,
after the Swiss Market Index yesterday dropped the most in four
weeks, as  Swatch (UHR)  Group AG climbed, offsetting concern that the
euro area has yet to contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  Nestle SA (NESN)  and  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  dragged the most on the  SMI (SMI) ,
each slipping 0.6 percent. Swatch, the biggest maker of Swiss
watches, climbed after Helvea reinstated coverage of the shares.  The SMI, a measure of Switzerland’s largest and most
actively traded companies, lost 0.1 percent to 6,163.49 at the
close in Zurich, paring an earlier retreat of as much as 0.7
percent. The gauge yesterday posted its biggest decline since
March 6. The number of shares changing hands on the index today
was 4.2 percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The broader Swiss Performance Index was
also little changed.  “The phase of ‘all is well’ was at the start of the year;
now we’re returning to reality,” said Yves Maillot, the head of
investments at Robeco Gestions SA in Paris, who helps oversee
$6.8 billion. The declines in stocks “are normal when you see
the nervousness on the  bond market .”  The Swiss franc strengthened through 1.20 per euro today
for the first time since Sept. 6., when the  Swiss National Bank 
imposed a limit on the currency. Within minutes of the franc
breaching the ceiling, the central bank declared it would fight
any further attacks.  Spanish Bond Yields  The yield difference, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
bonds and similar-maturity German bunds rose to more than 400
basis points, or 4 percentage points, for the first time since
Dec. 12. The spread widened 13 basis points to 403 basis points.
Spain’s 10-year yield climbed seven basis points to 5.76
percent. The rate on German 10-year bunds dropped six basis
points to 1.73 percent.  France  sold 8.4 billion euros ($11 billion) of bonds, at
the top end of its target, with borrowing costs rising for much
of the debt sold. The nation auctioned 4.32 billion euros of
benchmark 10-year debt at an average yield of 2.98 percent, more
than the 2.91 percent paid at the last sale on March 1.  Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, lost 0.6 percent
to 55.95 Swiss francs. Roche, the world’s largest maker of
cancer drugs, declined 0.6 percent to 157.50 francs.  Tornos Holding AG (TOHN)  slid 2.9 percent to 9.66 francs. The
manufacturer of  machine tools  cut working hours, citing its
order levels.  Swatch added 1.4 percent to 421.40 francs. Helvea
reinstated the shares with an accumulate recommendation and set
the price target at 480 francs.  Oridion Systems Ltd. (ORIDN)  soared 70 percent to 20.45 francs, its
biggest rally since its initial public offering in 2000, after
Covidien Plc agreed to buy the Jerusalem-based medical-device
maker for $346 million.  Newron Pharmaceuticals SpA (NWRN)  jumped 18 percent to 4.28
francs. The biotechnology company entered a strategic pact with
Zambon SpA for Newron’s safinamide compound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
