Oil gained for the first time in
three days as  claims  for U.S. unemployment benefits dropped to a
four-year low and equities pared losses, raising hopes that
demand will grow in the world’s leading user of crude.  Futures rose 1.8 percent, completing the first weekly gain
since March 9, after the Labor Department said jobless claims
fell 6,000 to 357,000 in the week ended March 31 and the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rebounded from a 0.4 percent
decline. Trading is closed tomorrow for Good Friday.  “Crude is showing resilience and we have support from the
jobs report,” said  Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. in New York. “Traders are not willing to be
short over the long weekend.”  Crude for May delivery gained $1.84 to settle at $103.31 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices rose 29 cents
this week. The price ranged from $101.37 to $103.40.  Brent oil for May settlement rose $1.09, or 0.9 percent, to
$123.43 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange. Brent’s premium to WTI narrowed 75 cents to $20.12 a
barrel after widening for six days in a row.  “The jobless claims number was pretty supportive,” said
 Kyle Cooper , director of IAF Advisors, a Houston-based
consulting firm. “You had a big selloff yesterday and we are
seeing a little bit of a rebound today.”  The four-week moving average of jobless claims, a less
volatile measure than the weekly figures, decreased to 361,750
last week from 366,000, according to the Labor Department.  More Jobs  The government may report tomorrow that the  U.S. economy 
added more than 200,000 jobs for a third consecutive month in
March, according to a Bloomberg survey. ADP Employer Services
found that company payrolls grew by 209,000 in March, with
employment expanding in all major sectors of the economy.  “The good jobless number seems to suggest that perhaps the
U.S. economy is going to be left unscathed by concerns over
Europe,” said  Phil Flynn , an analyst at PFGBest in Chicago.  U.S. consumer confidence climbed last week to the highest
level in four years as brighter job prospects and an advancing
stock market bolstered Americans’ view of the economy. The
Bloomberg Consumer  Comfort Index (COMFCOMF)  rose to minus 31.4 in the
period ended April 1, the best reading since March 2008, from
minus 34.7 the prior week. All three of its components advanced.  Demand Growth  U.S.  gasoline demand  gained 0.8 percent in the week ended
March 30 to 8.78 million barrels a day, the highest level since
Dec. 23, the Energy Department reported yesterday.  Days of
supply  fell to a 12-week low of 25.9.  “Demand is going to get a pickup as we approach the
summer,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics,
an energy-research firm in  London , Arkansas. “The U.S. economy
is recovering.”  Prices extended gains as equities pared losses. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.1 percent at 3:41 p.m. after
falling as much as 0.4 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
also declined 0.1 percent, wiping out most of an earlier drop.  “The equity market pushed up and it helped oil,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  Oil fell in early trading after Spain Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  said the country, the fourth-largest economy in
the euro region, may require international aid and a report that
German  industrial output  decreased 1.3 percent in February from
January.  Futures tumbled 2.4 percent yesterday after the Energy
Department said  inventories  rose 9.01 million barrels to 362.4
million last week. U.S. production gained 2.9 percent to 6.05
million barrels a day, the highest level in 12 years.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 439,543
contracts as of 3:25 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 682,076
contracts yesterday, 4.9 percent above the three-month average.
