Employers in the U.S. announced
fewer  job cuts  in March than a year earlier, another sign of
healing in the labor market.  Planned firings fell by 8.8 percent from March 2011 to a
10-month low of 37,880, according to figures released today by
Chicago-based job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas
Inc. Job cuts at government and nonprofit agencies were down 86
percent last quarter compared with the same period in 2011, the
report showed.  Dismissals are waning as employers become more optimistic
about the economic outlook. At the same time, rising gasoline
prices pose a risk to  consumer spending , which accounts for
about 70 percent of the world’s largest economy.  “Both consumer products and transportation saw fewer job
cuts in March after experiencing heavy cuts in February,” John A. Challenger, chief executive officer of Challenger, Gray &
Christmas, said in a statement. “These are key indicators of
the economy’s health.”  Compared with February, announcements fell 27 percent.
Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal effects,
economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes rather than
monthly numbers.  Telecommunications firms led all industries with 4,089
announced job cuts in March, with almost half coming from T-
Mobile USA Inc., followed by 3,733 dismissals in education.  Cuts in California  California led all states with 3,904 announced job cuts.
 North Carolina  followed with 3,717 reductions, while Washington
state had 3,208 firings.  Employers announced plans to  take on  12,390 workers, up
from 10,720 the prior month, the report said.  The Labor Department tomorrow may report payrolls climbed
by 205,000 workers in March following a 227,000 increase in
February, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The  unemployment rate  probably held
at 8.3 percent.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose jobs are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies, and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
