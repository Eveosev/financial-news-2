U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened after
the discount for West Texas Intermediate compared with Brent
narrowed the first time in seven sessions.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on May futures prices,
narrowed 75 cents to $20.12 a barrel in  New York . When Brent
decreases versus WTI, it typically boosts the value of low-
sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium lost $1.20 to $21.25 a
barrel over the U.S. benchmark at 4:03 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) 
decreased $1.50 to $22.50 a barrel over.  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed 75 cents to $18 a barrel
over WTI, and  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  decreased $1.25 to a premium of $14.50.
Poseidon’s premium narrowed $1.55 to $13.25, while Southern
Green Canyon’s dropped $2.30 to $13.50.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 25 cents a barrel to
$8.90 below WTI.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $1 to $23 a
barrel, Bakken oil’s widened $1 to $11 and Syncrude’s discount
narrowed $1 to $3 under WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
