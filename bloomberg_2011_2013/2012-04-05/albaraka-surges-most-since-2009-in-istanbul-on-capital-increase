Albaraka Turk Katilim Bankasi AS (ALBRK) , a
Turkish Islamic bank, advanced after announcing a capital
increase.  The shares gained 1.5 percent to 2.01 liras by the close in
Istanbul after surging as much as 11 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since October 2009.  Albaraka sent a request to regulators to increase its
capital by 361 million liras ($201 million) to 900 million
liras, it said in a statement to the stock exchange after the
market close yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
