Claims (INJCJC)  for U.S. unemployment
benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in four years,
adding to recent reports showing signs of health in the economy.  Jobless claims fell 6,000 to 357,000 in the week ended
March 31, the fewest since April 2008, the Labor Department
reported today in  Washington . The  median forecast  of 43
economists in a Bloomberg News survey estimated a decrease to
355,000. The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls also
dropped, while those getting extended payments increased.  The improved labor market, rising stock prices and easier
credit are lifting U.S.  consumer confidence  and spending, which
accounts for 70 percent of the economy. A report tomorrow may
show the world’s largest economy added more than 200,000 jobs in
March for a third consecutive month, the longest streak of
similar increases since late 1999 to early 2000.  “The labor market is going to continue to gradually heal,
though we have a long ways to go,” said  Ryan Sweet , a senior
economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in  West Chester ,
 Pennsylvania . “The economy is pulling up pretty well given the
headwinds we’re seeing from  Europe .”  Stocks held earlier losses after the report. The contract
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in June dropped 0.3
percent to 1,389.3 at 8:45 a.m. in  New York  as a decline in
Spanish bonds boosted concern the euro area has yet to contain
its debt crisis.  Claims estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from
350,000 to 370,000. The four-week moving average, a less-
volatile measure than the weekly figures, decreased to 361,750
last week, from 366,000.  Growing Economy  Companies are retaining workers and hiring amid robust
sales and growing consumer confidence. Manufacturing expanded at
a faster pace in March from a month earlier, the  Institute for
Supply Management  reported this week, and a measure of
employment rose to the highest level since June. Cars and light
trucks sold at a 14.3 million annual rate in March, capping the
strongest quarter in four years.  The total number of people receiving jobless benefits fell
by 16,000 in the week ended March 24 to 3.34 million.  In addition to the jobless claims, the number of Americans
receiving extended benefits under federal programs increased by
about 17,000 to 3.26 million in the week ended March 17.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 2.6 percent,
today’s report showed.  Twenty-six states and territories reported a decline in
claims, while 27 reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Growing Confidence  The more robust job market is bolstering consumer sentiment
and spending, an improvement evident in new car sales, said  Don
Johnson , vice president of U.S. sales at  General Motors Co. (GM)   “The good news is that the industry and consumers have
been very resilient in the face of higher pump prices. The
steadily improving economy is playing a role and so is pent-up
demand and an improved credit market,” Johnson said in a call
with analysts this week.  A report from ADP Employer Services found that company
payrolls grew by 209,000 in March, with employment expanding in
all major sectors of the economy.  “A wide range of indicators suggests that the job market
has been improving, which is a welcome development indeed,”
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week.
“Still, conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for
example, by the high level of long-term unemployment and the
fact that jobs and hours worked remain well below pre-crisis
peaks.”  Tomorrow’s report from the Labor Department on total
payrolls, which includes government workers, is projected to
show a gain of 205,000 in March, according to a median forecast
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The jobless rate is
projected to hold at a three-year low of 8.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
