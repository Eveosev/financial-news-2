OAO EON Russia, the Moscow unit of
 Germany â€™s biggest utility, boosted earnings by 43 percent last
year after adding power production units.  Net income attributable to shareholders climbed to 14.6
billion rubles ($494 million) from 10.2 billion rubles in 2010,
the company said today on its website. That missed the average
estimate of 16 billion rubles in a Bloomberg survey of 17
analysts. Revenue rose 31 percent to 66.1 billion rubles.  EON Russia, formerly known as OGK-4, said new electricity
blocks and higher wholesale prices were behind the increase in
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
