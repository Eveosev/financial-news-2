South Korea  will set up a stock
market for small and midsized companies to help them build
capital via equity sales, the country’s finance regulator said.  The Korea New Exchange, tentatively called Konex, will open
by the end of this year following public hearings and revisions
to capital market rules, the  Financial Services Commission  said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Kim Seok Dong, the FSC’s chairman, pledged this year to
expand financial services to lower-income people and smaller
companies to buffer them from global market unrest. Individual
investors will participate in the new market through mutual
funds, as only professional firms will be able to trade there,
the regulator said.  “Our small and medium-sized companies now mostly rely on
bank loans rather than direct financing, raising their interest
burden,” Zhin Woong Seop, director general at the commisson’s
capital markets bureau, told reporters today. “We want to add
policy efforts that help such companies with growth potential.”  Korea Exchange Inc., the nation’s bourse operator, now runs
two stock markets. The mainboard  Kospi (KOSPI)  consists of 779 stocks,
including some of the country’s biggest companies such as
 Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  The 1,031-member
 Kosdaq (KOSDAQ)  consists mostly of smaller technology companies.  Korea Exchange will operate the Konex market, Zhin said.  South Korea is the world’s 13th largest stock market with a
market capitalization of $1.1 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
