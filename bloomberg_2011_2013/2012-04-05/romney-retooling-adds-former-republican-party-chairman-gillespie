Republican presidential front-runner
 Mitt Romney  announced today that his campaign has brought on  Ed Gillespie , a former chairman of the  Republican National
Committee  and a former aide to President George W. Bush, to help
craft his message and unite the party as he prepares to take on
President Barack Obama.  Romney’s move, reported earlier by Politico, is the latest
evidence that the former Massachusetts governor is retooling his
campaign to target the president even before the formal end of
the primary season.  A veteran strategist, Gillespie has deep relationships
within the Republican establishment and has specialized in
broadening the party’s outreach to key groups that can sway
elections. In 1994, as a top aide to then-Representative  Dick
Armey  of Texas, he was involved in drafting the “Contract with
America” that helped give Republicans control of the U.S. House
for the first time in 40 years.  In a statement today, Romney said Gillespie will “help in
bringing Republicans and all Americans together behind my
campaign.”  In recent months, Gillespie has worked to improve the
party’s standing with Hispanic voters -- an area in which Romney
recently acknowledged his weakness.  Gillespie, an Alexandria, Virginia-based political
consultant, will serve as a senior adviser to Romney’s Boston-
based campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
