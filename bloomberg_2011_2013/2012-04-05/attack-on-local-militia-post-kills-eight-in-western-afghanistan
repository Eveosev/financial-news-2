Eight members of an Afghan
government-sponsored militia were killed in an insurgent attack
on their security post in a western province.  Armed guerrillas struck the force, known as the Afghan
Local Police, in the Khak Safid district of Farah province late
yesterday, deputy provincial governor Mohammed Yunus Rasouli
said by phone.  “They first choked a guard at the gate of the outpost, and
then they entered and killed seven others,” Rasouli said. The
insurgents fled with weapons and equipment, he said. There was
no immediate claim of responsibility from the Taliban.  Afghan Local Police units are formed with the help of the
U.S. military, the  Associated Press  reported. Members are
recruited from local communities and are paid by the government
to guard checkpoints, the  news agency  said.  Earlier Wednesday, the Taliban said it carried out a
bombing that killed 13 people in northern Faryab province,
including six civilians, four Afghan police officers and three
members of NATO’s International Security Assistance Force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
