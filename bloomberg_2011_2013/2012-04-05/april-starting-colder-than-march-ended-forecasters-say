Colder weather may grip the eastern
U.S. next week as April starts chillier than March ended,
potentially boosting demand for heating homes and businesses,
forecasters said.  Temperatures may fall 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 Celsius)
below normal through the Ohio Valley and along the South
Carolina coast from April 11 to April 15, according to  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  The area from the northern Mississippi River to the East
Coast may be 6 degrees below normal, Salmon said in his 6- to
10-day outlook.  Commodities traders watch temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for hearing, according to the Energy Department. Across the
U.S. 7,700 daily high temperature records were set or matched in
March, according to the National Climate Data Center.  Gas has dropped 28 percent this year as a stockpile surplus
to the five-year average expanded to 59 percent in the week
ended March 23, the biggest gap since April 2006, Energy
Department data show. Inventories rose to 2.437 trillion cubic
feet, the highest level for the time of year since at least
1994.  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland, projects the gas-weighted heating-degree
days value for April 1 to April 15 will be 175.7, while the
value for March 16 to March 31 was 143.9.  “It’s like we are going in reverse a bit here,” Rogers
said.  Degree Days Values  Heating-degree days values are calculated by subtracting
the daily average temperature from a base of 65 degrees to show
energy demand. Higher values mean cooler weather and more energy
being used to heat homes and businesses.  A large part of the central U.S., as well as New England,
may have temperatures closer to seasonal norms from April 15 to
April 19, according to an 11- to 15-day forecast from  MDA
EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  The southeastern U.S. and Middle Atlantic regions, as well
as western Canada, may be 3 to 4 degrees warmer during that same
time period, according to MDA.  The normal average temperature for April 11 in  New York  is
about 51, according to MDA. It’s 47 in Boston, 46 in  Chicago , 56
in  St. Louis , 61 in Atlanta, 64 in Dallas, 68 in Houston, 50 in
 Seattle  and 61 in Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
