Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  shut
a 20-inch natural gas pipeline in South Texas after it was
punctured by a third-party contractor working near the line, a
company spokesman said.  “The impact of the supplies is going to be very minimal,”
 Rick Rainey , a spokesman for the company in Houston, said in a
telephone interview. “This line was flowing at a reduced rate”
because of planned maintenance taking place at a processing
facility it feeds, he said.  There was no fire and no injuries from the incident that
punctured the pipeline instead of rupturing it, he said.  Gas is being removed from the line to prepare for repairs,
Rainey said. The pipeline is part of the South Texas gathering
system and supplies can be transported on other lines, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
