Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures rose for the first time in three days after
U.S. unemployment claims declined to a four-year low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.3 percent at 3:10 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , compared with 24.7 yesterday.  Crude for May delivery gained $1.84 to settle at $103.31 a
barrel after the Labor Department said jobless claims fell 6,000
to 357,000 in the week ended March 31. The government may report
tomorrow that the economy added more than 200,000 jobs for a
third straight month in March, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $97 puts, which slid 29 cents to 25 cents a barrel at 3:18
p.m. with 1,495 contracts trading. June $150 calls were the
second-most active, with 1,213 lots changing hands. They were
unchanged at 5 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of the 136,789 trades
yesterday. May $110 calls were the most actively traded, with
6,311 lots changing hands as they fell 16 cents to 13 cents a
barrel. The next-most active options, May $100 puts, rose 67
cents to $1.29 on volume of 6,224.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 46,183
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 39,085 lots and
December $100 calls with 34,928.  To contact the reporter on this story:
