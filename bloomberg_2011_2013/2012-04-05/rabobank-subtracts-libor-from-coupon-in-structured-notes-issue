Rabobank Nederland (RABO) , the highest-
rated privately owned lender, sold $5 million of structured
notes where an interbank lending benchmark is subtracted from
interest payments instead of being added to them.  The 10-year securities, known as inverse floating-rate
notes, pay a fixed coupon of 3.15 percent in the first year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In year two, investors
receive 3.95 percent rising to 7.15 percent in the final year,
less the prevailing  London interbank offered rate  for six-month
dollar loans. The coupon is floored at zero percent.  Utrecht, Netherlands-based Rabobank has the option of
repaying the notes from April 2013, Bloomberg data show. Six-
month dollar Libor was fixed at 0.733 percent today.  Barclays Capital  placed the inverse FRNs with investors on
March 27 in only the fourth such transaction this year.
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Royal Bank of Canada
and BNP Paribas SA have done similar deals in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
