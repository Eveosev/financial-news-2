Oil in  New York  traded near its
lowest price in seven weeks, paring earlier gains amid renewed
concern that the euro area has yet to contain its debt crisis.  Futures were little changed, after advancing as much as 1
percent. European equities retreated and the euro weakened
against the dollar as Spanish bonds fell and borrowing costs
increased at a French auction. A report showed industrial output
in  Germany  declined more than forecast last month. New York
crude dropped 2.4 percent yesterday, leaving West Texas
Intermediate futures at the biggest discount to London-traded
 Brent crude  in more than five months.  “Oil is staying near yesterday’s low on concerns about the
European debt situation,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of
commodities research at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “It is in
line with all risky assets right now. Today we had France,
yesterday we had Spain’s auction. Equities and commodities are
being driven by a higher  risk aversion .”  Crude for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was at $101.88, up 41 cents, at 12:47 p.m. London time, after
gaining as much as 96 cents to $102.43 a barrel. The contract
fell yesterday to as low as $101.08, the least since Feb. 16.
Prices are down 1.3 percent since March 30, putting crude on
track for its fourth weekly decline.  Brent oil for May settlement advanced 29 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $123.63 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate widened to $21.75 from
yesterday’s close of $20.87, the highest since Oct. 21.  The dollar gained 0.5 percent against the euro, while the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell as much as 0.9 percent.  U.S. Inventories  Prices slipped yesterday after government figures showed
U.S. crude supplies climbed the most since 2008. They increased
by 9.01 million barrels last week to 362.4 million, according to
the Energy Department. They were forecast to increase 2.5
million barrels, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey.  Gasoline supplies fell 1.46 million barrels, Energy
Department data showed. They were projected to drop 1.4 million
barrels, according to the survey. Inventories of distillates, a
category that includes diesel and heating oil, rose by 19,000
barrels compared with an estimate for a 500,000 gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
