Light-distillate (SPIVLDIS)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s biggest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 6.7 percent to end a four-week decline, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate rose 681,000 barrels in the seven days to yesterday to
10.8 million,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-
mailed statement. Supplies fell 1.6 million barrels over the
previous four weeks.  Middle-distillate (SPIVMDIS)  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene increased 721,000 barrels, or 7.8 percent, to 9.96
million, the ministry’s data showed.  Supplies of  residual fuels , including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, were down 1.35
million barrels, or 5.8 percent, at 22.1 million, according to
the data. Stockpiles dropped for the first time in four weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
