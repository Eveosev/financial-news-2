Camargo Correa SA said it has no
agreement with Votorantim Cimentos SA about Cimpor-Cimentos de
Portugal SGPS SA, Jornal de Negocios reported, citing Jose Edison, president of Camargo’s Intercement unit.  The possibility of an agreement in the future is not ruled
out, the Portuguese newspaper said.  Camargo Correa, a Brazilian cement producer and the biggest
investor in  Cimpor (CPR) , on March 30 offered 2.48 billion euros ($3.3
billion) through its Intercement unit to buy the 67 percent of
the Portuguese company it doesn’t already own. Votorantim,
another Brazilian company, is also a shareholder in Cimpor.  Camargo’s offer will be financed by Brazilian banks  Banco
