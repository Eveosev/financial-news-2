Kemble Water Holdings Ltd.’s Thames
Water unit, the U.K.’s largest water company that serves 8.8
million homes and businesses in  London , joined six rivals in
imposing water restrictions after a 22-month drought.  Anglian Water, South East Water, Southern Water, Sutton and
East Surrey Water, Veolia Water Southeast and Veolia Water
Central also are suppliers with bans that begin today, the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  New “hose-pipe bans” restrict the use of garden hoses to
water yards, wash cars, fill pools, ponds and fountains, and
clean windows, walls and patios. Violations can result in a fine
of as much as 1,000 pounds ($1,600), Defra said.  “The whole of the southeast and East Anglia are already in
drought,” it said. The drought could spread as far north as
East Yorkshire and west to the Hampshire-Wiltshire border if the
dry weather continues this spring, Defra said on its  website ,
citing a March 12 report by the  Environment Agency .  Parts of central and eastern  England  have been in drought
since June while London and most of the southeast are now
enduring the same after a dry winter, according to the
Environment Agency. East Anglia, which includes Cambridge and
Norwich, has had the driest six months since records began in
1921. The agency reported  last week  that parts of Yorkshire from
Sheffield to Scarborough are now in the drought zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
