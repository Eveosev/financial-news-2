CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, said it expects to maintain its dividend policy
of paying out between 50 percent and 60 percent of net income
while it builds new reactors at the Temelin nuclear power
station, denying earlier media reports.  Slashing the dividend is a “purely theoretical” scenario
and would be used only in “extremely unlikely situations” not
necessarily related to Temelin, spokeswoman Eva Novakova said
today in an e-mailed message.  She reacted to a Dow Jones report saying CEZ may scale back
its dividend policy in the future to finance Temelin, citing
Pavel Cyrani, the company’s chief strategist. CEZ is 70 percent
owned by the state.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
