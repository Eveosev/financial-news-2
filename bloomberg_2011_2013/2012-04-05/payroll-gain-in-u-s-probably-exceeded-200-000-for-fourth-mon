Employers probably added more than
200,000 workers to payrolls in March for a fourth straight month
as U.S. companies gained confidence sales will keep improving,
economists said before a government report today.  Hiring increased by 205,000 after rising by 227,000 in
February, according to the median projection of 80 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The last time employment advanced at
a similar pace for as many months was late 1999 into 2000. The
 jobless rate  probably held at a three-year low of 8.3 percent.  The pickup in jobs has propelled consumer sentiment to a
four-year high, boosting the odds household spending, which
accounts for 70 percent of the economy, will keep growing. At
the same time, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last
week said growth needs to accelerate to maintain the pace of
hiring, one reason policy makers say  interest rates  will
probably remain low at least through late 2014.  “The labor market’s improvement will help  consumer
spending ,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “We expect labor-
market conditions to improve at a modest pace throughout the
balance of the year.”  The Labor Department’s report is scheduled to be released
at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Payroll estimates in the Bloomberg
survey ranged from increases of 175,000 to 250,000.  Projections (USURTOT) 
for the jobless rate ranged from 8.1 percent to 8.4 percent.  Stock Futures  U.S. equity futures rose before the jobs figures, with the
contract on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPA)  expiring in June
climbing 0.2 percent to 1,393.4 at 6:43 a.m. in  New York . The
yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.20
percent from 2.18 percent late yesterday.  Asian stocks fell for a third day as concern about Europe’s
debt crisis weighed on confidence. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) 
retreated 0.4 percent.  While a 0.8 percentage-point drop in unemployment since
August may underpin President  Barack Obama ’s standing leading up
to the vote in November, only one president since World War II,
 Ronald Reagan , has been re-elected with a jobless rate above 6
percent. Reagan won a second term in 1984 with 7.2 percent
unemployment in the month of the election, after the rate had
fallen almost three percentage points in the previous 18 months.  The U.S. again may be emerging as a main engine for global
growth as  Europe  slides into recession and  China ’s economy
decelerates.  China Economy  China’s Premier Wen Jiabao cut this year’s growth target to
7.5 percent last month from an 8 percent goal in place since
2005 as officials seek to shift the economy toward more
consumption. That’s down from last year’s 9.2 percent expansion.  Gross domestic product in the 17-nation euro area fell  0.3
percent (EUGNEMUQ)  in the fourth quarter, the first contraction since 2009.
Manufacturing shrank in March, and unemployment rose to 10.8
percent in February.  In the U.S., dismissals have subsided, suggesting companies
may be more confident about the economic outlook. Applications
for jobless claims averaged 361,800 over the past four weeks,
the lowest  level  in four years. Five months ago they averaged
399,800, Labor Department data show.  Companies are forecast to expand payrolls by 215,000, after
a 233,000 gain in February, according to the survey median.
Factory payrolls for March are projected to rise by 20,000 after
a 31,000 gain.  Adding Shifts  Strengthening demand is prompting companies like  Ford Motor
Co. (F) , the second-biggest U.S. automaker, to bring in more
workers. The Dearborn, Michigan-based manufacturer boosted its
2012 sales forecast to 14.5 million to 15 million vehicles from
a previous projection of 13.5 million to 14.5 million.  “We’ve already announced some shift increases, some adds
in terms of shifts this year,”  Erich Merkle , sales analyst at
Ford, said April 3 on a conference call with analysts. “So,
certainly we’ll be adding some people to fill those shifts.”  Recent data showing the expansion will be sustained have
also lifted share prices. The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced 12 percent during
the first quarter, including a 3.1 percent increase in March.
That marked the strongest three-month start to a year since a
13.5 percent advance in the first quarter of 1998.  The world’s largest economy expanded 1.7 percent in 2011,
Commerce Department figures show. The U.S. is projected to grow
2.2 percent this year, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 70 economists last month.  Gasoline Prices  Wage increases are needed to help Americans weather
gasoline prices that have increased by 66 cents this year
through April 4, to $3.94 a  gallon , according to data from AAA,
the nation’s largest auto club.  The improving labor market is helping ease the burden of
fuel costs, as evidenced by stronger household sentiment. The
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort  Index (COMFCOMF)  last week climbed to the
highest level since 2008.  Bernanke, in a speech to economists on March 26, said the
employment gains have been a “welcome development. Still,
conditions remain far from normal, as shown, for example, by the
high level of long-term unemployment and the fact that jobs and
hours worked remain well below pre-crisis peaks.”  “We cannot yet be sure that the recent pace of improvement
in the labor market will be sustained,” Bernanke said, adding
he was particularly concerned about the number people out of
work for six months or longer.  The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or more, as a
percentage of all jobless, was  42.6 percent  in February. That
compares with 17.4 percent in December 2007, when the 18-month
recession began.
