First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar panels, received funding from the U.S. Energy
Department that paves the way for  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  to complete its
acquisition of the Antilope Valley Solar Ranch One $1.36 billion
power project.  First Solar got the first advance under the loan guarantee
program, the Tempe, Arizona-based company said today in a
statement.  Exelon Corp. in September agreed to buy the 230-megawatt
plant from First Solar for $75 million, contingent upon
government funding. The Chicago-based power company said it will
invest as much as $713 million in the project.  Construction of the plant is being partly funded by a $646
million Energy Department loan guarantee that had been delayed
by a local permitting issue.  First Solar was down 2.7 percent to $21.15 as 2:07 p.m. in
 New York . The shares have declined 86 percent over the past
year. Exelon slipped 1.3 percent to $38.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
