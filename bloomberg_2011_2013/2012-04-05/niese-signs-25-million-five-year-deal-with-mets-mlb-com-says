Starting pitcher Jon Niese signed a
five-year, $25 million contract with the  New York Mets , MLB.com
reported, citing a person familiar with the deal.  The contract, dependent on the left-hander passing a
physical, includes two club options that could increase its
worth to $52 million, the website reported.  Niese, 25, who is starting his third full Major League
Baseball season with the Mets, would have become a free agent
after the 2015 season without the contract in place, MLB.com
said.  Last season, Niese was 11-11 with a 4.40 earned run average.
He tallied 138 strikeouts in 157 1/3 innings while giving up 178
hits, 77 earned runs and 14 home runs before his season was
ended by a muscle strain. During his career from 2008-11, he has
gone 22-23 with a 4.39 ERA in 65 games.  The team declined to confirm the deal, spokesman  Jay Horwitz  said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
