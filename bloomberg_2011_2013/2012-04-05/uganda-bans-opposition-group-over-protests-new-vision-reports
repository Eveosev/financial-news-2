Uganda  banned Activists for Change,
an opposition pressure group which has been agitating for
political reforms, New Vision reported, citing police chief Kale
Kayihura.  The decision was made by the cabinet and executed by the
attorney general, the Kampala-based newspaper reported.  Ugandaâ€™s main opposition parties, working within the group,
held three phases of protests in the last year, including the
so-called walk-to-work demonstrations over economic conditions
in the East African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
