Rangers Football Club’s
administrators said they will consider three of the four bids
submitted for the Glasgow soccer team.  Rangers, which has won a record 54 Scottish titles, went
into administration, a form of bankruptcy, in February as U.K.
tax authorities chased the team over unpaid bills.  “We can now see light at the end of the tunnel whereby the
club can exit from administration and focus upon success on the
pitch,” administrators Duff & Phelps said today in an e-mailed
statement. “While we cannot be precise on timescale, exit from
administration does look achievable by the end of the season. We
also hope to announce next week acceptance of one bid, which
would then be subject to a period of due diligence and
exclusivity.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
