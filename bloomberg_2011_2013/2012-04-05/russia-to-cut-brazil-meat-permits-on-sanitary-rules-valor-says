Russia  will likely reduce the number
of Brazilian plants certified to export meat to the eastern
European country as it raises sanitary standards, Valor
Economico reported.  Rosselkhoznadzor, a food safety watchdog in Russia, warned
Brazilian officials of the possible reduction in a meeting last
week, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Brazil  has 139 plants registered to export meat to Russia,
of which eight are fully certified, 40 are under certain
restrictions and the other 91 are banned, Valor said.  Brazil is the worldâ€™s largest beef and poultry exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
