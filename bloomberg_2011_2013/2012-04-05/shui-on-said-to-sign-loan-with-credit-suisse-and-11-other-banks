Shui On Development Holding Ltd. (272) , a
unit of property developer Shui On Land Ltd., signed a $339
million equivalent loan with 12 banks, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Credit Suisse Group AG arranged the facility, which was
funded at the end of March and matures in 2015, the person said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.
Eleven banks joined in syndication, the person said.  Ingrid Tang, a spokeswoman for Shui On Land, wasn’t
immediately available to comment on the loan today.  The debt is backed by property in the Xintiandi district of
shops and restaurants in downtown Shanghai, and the borrower was
able to obtain a relatively low cost of financing, paying a
margin of 310 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate, the person said.  Shui On Land’s $475 million of 9.75 percent bonds due 2015
yielded 9.74 percent as of 10 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to BNP
Paribas SA prices on Bloomberg.  Shui On Land, which redeveloped and renovated the Xintiandi
area, also set up its own hotel, restaurant and clubs there,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
