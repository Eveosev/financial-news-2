Francois Hollande ,  France ’s
Socialist presidential contender, gained support among voters as
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  stalled with less than three weeks
before the first round of elections, a poll showed.  About 29 percent of voters intend to back Hollande in the
first round, up three points in a week, according to a CSA poll
for BFM TV, 20 Minutes newspaper and RMC radio. Sarkozy’s
support was unchanged at 30 percent, it added.  Hollande’s second-round lead widened to 8 points from 6
points, CSA said. The Socialist candidate would win 54 percent
of the vote in the run-off, with 46 percent for Sarkozy.  French voters will choose between 10 candidates for the
first round of the election April 22 and the two front-runners
will face-off in a May 6 ballot. CSA interviewed 884 voters on
April 2 and 3. No margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
