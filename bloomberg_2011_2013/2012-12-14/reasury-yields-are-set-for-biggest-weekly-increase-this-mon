Treasuries rose for the first time
in four days as consumer prices fell, a sign inflation is in
check even as the  Federal Reserve  prepares to expand bond
buying, and no progress was reported on a U.S. budget standoff.  Thirty-year  bonds  led the rally even as U.S. industrial
production climbed. U.S. four-week bill rates turned  negative 
for the first time since January. The Fed bought $1.98 billion
in Treasuries due from 2036 to 2042. President  Barack Obama  and
House Speaker  John Boehner  met for a third time at the White
House yesterday to discuss averting the so-called fiscal cliff
of automatic spending cuts and tax boosts at year-end.  “You can’t look at anything and say we have an inflation
problem,” said  Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York 
at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “That gives them the
cover to continue to do what they are doing. The market is
totally dominated by Fed buying.”  The  30-year bond  yield dropped four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.86 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 2.93
percent yesterday, the highest level since Nov. 2. The price of
the 2.75 percent security due in November 2042 gained 26/32, or
$8.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 23/32.  The yield on the  10-year note  decreased three basis points
to 1.7 percent after rising earlier to 1.75 percent, the highest
level since Nov. 7.  Net Longs  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Dec. 11 from the highest since 2008, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 136,979 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions fell by 65,712 contracts, or
32 percent, from a week earlier, when they rose to 202,691, the
most since March 2008, according to the Washington-based
commission’s Commitments of Traders report.  Treasuries rose today as Labor Department data showed the
 consumer price index  fell 0.3 percent last month, more than
forecast, in the first drop since May. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey was for a 0.2 percent decline.  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, known as the 10-year  break-even 
rate, narrowed to 2.46 percentage points, from 2.51 on Dec. 12,
the most in five weeks. The gap signals traders’ outlook for
consumer prices over the life of the securities.  “I don’t think inflation will be a concern in the near-
term,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the Fed.  Weekly Losses  Treasuries pared weekly losses today. Thirty-year bond
yields increased five basis points since Dec. 7, and 10-year
yields rose eight basis points.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 30-year bonds
instead of two-year notes, the yield curve, shrank to 263 basis
points after touching 266 basis points yesterday, the most since
Oct. 25. The spread reached a 2012 high of 310 basis points on
March 19 and a low for the year of 224 basis points on July 25.  The government will sell $113 billion of notes next week:
$35 billion in two-year debt, an equal amount of five-year
securities, $29 billion in seven-year notes and $14 billion in
five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. The auctions
will be on four consecutive days beginning Dec. 17.  Operation Twist  The Fed bought Treasuries today as part of its Operation
Twist program to push down borrowing rates. It will  purchase  as
much as $9 billion next week of bonds due from 2036 to 2042 and
from 2023 to 2031. The four operations begin Dec. 18.  Policy makers said Dec. 12 the central bank will buy $45
billion of  U.S. government debt  each month from January in
addition to $40 million in monthly mortgage-bond purchases it’s
already making. The expansion will follow the expiration at
year-end of Operation Twist, a $667 billion program in which the
central bank has sold about $45 billion in short-term Treasuries
each month and bought an equal amount of longer-term debt.  The U.S. four-week  bill rate  dropped below zero today as
traders speculated temporary government insurance on some bank-
deposit accounts will end as scheduled on Dec. 31. That would
trigger a flow of several hundred billion dollars into Treasury
bills, repurchase agreements and money funds that purchase
 government securities , according to Fed primary dealers
including Bank of America Corp.  The rate touched negative 0.005 percent after rising to
0.1876 percent on Nov. 23, the highest level since 2009. It last
traded negative, meaning investors pay the government to hold
their cash safely, on Jan. 9.  Extension Fails  The Senate failed yesterday to move forward on a two-year
extension of the Transaction Account Guarantee program.
Introduced in the wake of the 2008 credit crisis, the program
guarantees $1.5 trillion in non-interest-bearing transaction
accounts that exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s
general limit of $250,000.  Boehner and Obama met for almost an hour yesterday, with no
public announcement of progress on a resolution of the stalemate
that the  Congressional Budget Office  has said may push the
world’s biggest economy into recession.  “It’s getting harder and harder to think we’ll get a deal
done,” Mitsubishi UFJ’s Roth said.  Treasuries gained today even after a report showed
industrial production in the U.S. rose in November by the most
in two years as manufacturers recovered from superstorm Sandy.  Output at factories, mines and utilities increased 1.1
percent after a revised 0.7 percent drop in October that was
more than initially estimated, the Fed reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
