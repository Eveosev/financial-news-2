China ’s power consumption increased
at the fastest pace in nine months in November as its economy
showed signs of a recovery.  Electricity use rose 7.6 percent last month from a year
earlier to 413.9 billion kilowatt-hours, the National Energy
Administration  said  on its website today. That’s the biggest
gain since February, the data show.  China’s power demand advanced in November as industrial
output and retail sales grew at the fastest pace since March,
government data show. The nation’s manufacturing may accelerate
in December, according to a preliminary purchasing managers’
index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  Secondary industries, which include typically energy-
intensive mining, manufacturing and construction companies,
consumed 7 percent more electricity last month than a year ago,
today’s report showed. Power demand by primary industries, which
include agriculture, fell 0.7 percent, while electricity use by
the tertiary sector, including services and logistics, increased
12.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
