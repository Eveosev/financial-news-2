Natural gas may advance next week as
forecasts show colder weather that would boost heating fuel
consumption, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Four of nine analysts, or 44 percent, said that futures
will rise on the New York Mercantile Exchange through Dec. 21.
Three, or 33 percent, said gas will  drop  and two predicted
prices will stay the same. Last week, 55 percent of participants
said gas would fall this week.  WSI Corp. in Andover,  Massachusetts , predicted normal or
below-normal temperatures in the eastern half of the U.S. from
Dec. 23 through Dec. 27. The low in New York on Dec. 27 may be
27 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 3 Celsius), 2 lower than usual,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  Gas slipped to $3.293 per million
British thermal units in intraday trading yesterday, the lowest
level since Sept. 28.  “I’m expecting colder weather to happen, especially as we
get into January,” said John Woods, president of JJ Woods
Associates and a Nymex floor trader. “The market is probably
going to try to bounce back after dipping below the $3.30
mark.”  Natural gas has tumbled 20.4 cents, or 5.7 percent, to
$3.347 per million Btu so far this week in New York. Prices last
week fell 0.3 percent and are up 12 percent this year.  A government report yesterday showed that U.S. stockpiles
climbed unexpectedly amid mild weather, rising 2 billion cubic
feet in the week ended Dec. 7 to 3.806 trillion. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg predicted a withdrawal of 3
billion cubic feet. The five-year average decline for the period
was 113 billion.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 49 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  4       3     2  To contact the reporter on this story:
