Zoomlion H.K. SPV Co., a unit of
 Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co. , said it has
received bondholder permission to issue more debt, a day after
pricing $600 million of new bonds.  The majority of bondholders agreed to amend the terms of
its 6.875 percent bonds due April 2017 to allow it to borrow
more, according to a statement to the Singapore stock exchange
today. The company priced $600 million of 10-year notes at a
yield premium of 456.2 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bondholders that consented to the changes before the
deadline will receive $2 for every $1,000 of principal held,
according to the Dec. 3 exchange  statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
