Philippine President Benigno Aquino
said he certified as urgent a bill that will make contraceptives
free to the poor to pave the way for its passage
before the end of the year.  “We hope this divisive issue is finished before next
year,” Aquino told reporters in  Manila  late yesterday.  The certification will waive the three-day waiting period
between votings on a bill. The House of Representatives is
scheduled to vote on the bill on its third and final reading on
Monday, while the Senate will tackle the measure on second
reading also on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
