MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, bought the Constitution Center office building in
 Washington  in a partnership with an institutional investor.  The 10-story 1.4 million square-foot (130,000-square-meter)
property, located two blocks from the National Mall, is fully
leased, New York-based MetLife said in a  statement  on its
website. Financial terms weren’t disclosed and MetLife’s U.S.-
based partner in the joint venture wasn’t named. The seller was
David Nassif Associates.  “We are pleased to acquire an asset of this quality, which
is positioned to provide attractive returns over a long-term
investment horizon,” Robert Merck, global head of MetLife Real
Estate Investors, said in the statement. MetLife “will target
opportunities to leverage our existing organizational expertise
and scale to create long-term value for our investors.”  MetLife, which invests in office, apartment, hotel, retail
and industrial real estate in major markets around the world,
yesterday announced a joint venture with  Loews Corp. (L)  for
ownership of the 632-room Loews Hollywood Hotel in  California .  A $250 million renovation of the Constitution Center was
completed this year, according to the statement.  Clarion Partners LLC advised MetLife’s joint venture
partner and Eastdil Secured LLC represented the seller.  To contact the reporter on this story:
