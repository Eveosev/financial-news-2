Near-zero  interest rates  in  Europe 
are causing investors to seek higher-yielding assets and could
lead to improper sales of structured products to individual
investors, according to a market regulator.  “The search for higher returns by investors in a
historical period of low interest rates leads retail consumers
to increase their demand for innovative forms of investments,
such as complex structured products,” said Steven Maijoor,
chairman of the Paris-based European Securities and Markets
Authority. “This heightens the risk of mis-selling.”  ESMA will need to remind European supervisors and banks
about proper selling practices for complex investments such as
structured products, Maijoor said in a Dec. 12 speech. His
comments echo remarks from  Richard Ketchum , chief executive
officer of the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, who
said Sept. 27 regulators may need to increase oversight if banks
don’t clamp down on improper sales practices.  Supervisors are paying particular attention to the quantity
and quality of information provided to investors by product
creators and distributors to enhance transparency in Europe’s
820 billion-euro ($1.1 trillion) market for individual
investors.   European Union-wide regulations for structured products,
which will require banks to provide so-called key information
documents for the products they sell to describe the main
characteristics and risks, could be in place by the end of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
