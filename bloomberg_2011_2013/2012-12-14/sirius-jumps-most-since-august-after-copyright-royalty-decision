Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI) , the U.S.
satellite-radio broadcaster, rose the most in four months after
a favorable ruling by the  Copyright Royalty Board  on how much
the company has to pay in music royalties through 2017.  The judges that make up the board determined that the rates
for Sirius to pay SoundExchange, an organization that collects
royalties for musicians, will increase to 9 percent of gross
revenue in 2013 from 8 percent this year. The fees will then
increase by half a percentage point every year until 2017.  The costs of the fees are passed on as charges to Sirius
customers, said Bryan Kraft, an analyst at  Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR)  in New York. The “manageable” royalty increase means the
New York-based company won’t see a defection of customers
because of higher rates, he said.  “If the rate increase were larger, you’d have to wonder if
Sirius can pass that through,” Kraft said. “Because the step-
ups are small, they can be passed through quite easily. It
removes an uncertainty.”  Sirius shares  gained 7 percent to $2.91 at the close in  New
York , the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 8. The stock has
advanced 60 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
