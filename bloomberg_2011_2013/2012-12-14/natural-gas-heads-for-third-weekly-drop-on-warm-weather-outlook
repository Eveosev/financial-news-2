Natural gas futures dropped to an
11-week low in  New York , capping a third weekly decline, as
forecasts showed warmer-than-normal weather in late December
that would reduce heating demand.  Gas slipped 1 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted mostly higher-than-average
temperatures in the Northeast and Great Lakes region from Dec.
24 through Dec. 28. The low in New York on Dec. 27 may be 39
degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), 10 more than the usual reading,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.   “Unless the weather starts to turn, the market is going to
continue to break down,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior
partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York. “Prices
are just going to keep drifting lower. We need winter weather.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 3.3 cents to settle
at $3.314 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , down 6.7 percent this week. The closing
price was the lowest since Sept. 27. The futures are up 11
percent this year.  January $3.50 calls were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 1.7 cents lower at 2.6 cents on
volume of 998 contracts as of 2:55 p.m. Calls accounted for 45
percent of options volume.  The low in  Boston  on Dec. 27 may be 31 degrees Fahrenheit,
6 above normal, according to AccuWeather. About 50 percent of
U.S. households use gas for heating.  This year will probably overtake 1998 to become the warmest
year on record in the U.S., the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration  said in a monthly climate report.  Warmest Year  The first 11 months were the warmest start to any year in
the contiguous states since the nation began keeping records in
1895, NOAA’s  Climatic Data Center  said Dec. 6.  The mild start to the winter “adds clear downside risk to
our 2013 Nymex natural gas price forecast of $4.25/mmBtu,”
Johan Spetz, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York,
said in a note to clients today.  A warm winter means more coal-to-gas switching at  power
plants  will be needed to keep inventories from exceeding a
“comfortable” 3.85 trillion cubic feet next fall, Spetz said.  The number of rigs drilling for gas in the U.S. slipped by
one to 416 this week, according to data from Baker Hughes Inc.
in Houston. The rig count is down 49 percent this year.  Gas inventories rose 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Dec. 7 to 3.806 trillion cubic feet, an Energy Department report
showed yesterday. It was the latest seasonal stockpile gain
since the week ended Dec. 30, 2005, according to department data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Stockpile Surplus  Supplies were 8 percent above the five-year average,
compared with 4.6 percent the previous week. The gas inventory
 surplus  to the average has declined from a six-year high of 61
percent in March, department data show.  “Prices look poised to fall, as the weather is simply not
generating heating demand in sufficient amounts to impact
inventories,”  Mike Fitzpatrick , editor of the Energy OverView
newsletter in New York, wrote today.  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11.  Marketed gas production will average 69.22 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, department estimates show.  Hub Price  Gas prices  at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
339,751 as of 2:46 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 362,000. Volume was 548,515 yesterday. Open interest was 1.16
million contracts. The three-month average is also 1.16 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
