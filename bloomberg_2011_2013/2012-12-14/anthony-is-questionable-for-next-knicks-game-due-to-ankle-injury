Carmelo Anthony’s availability for
the New York Knicks’ game tonight against the  Cleveland
Cavaliers  is uncertain because of an injured ankle.  Anthony sprained his left ankle midway through the third
quarter of a 116-107 win two nights ago against the Los Angeles
Lakers and remains questionable for tonight’s game at Madison
Square Garden in New York,  Jonathan Supranowitz , a spokesman for
the Knicks, said yesterday in an e-mail.  Anthony, who had 22 of his 30 points in the first quarter
against the Lakers, was injured while being fouled by Los
Angeles center  Dwight Howard  on a drive to the basket.  “I’m real sore right now -- ankle, knee, hip,” Anthony
told reporters after the game. “It was an awkward fall.”  Anthony, 28, is averaging 27.9 points per game this season,
second in the National Basketball Association to the Lakers’
Kobe Bryant (29.3).  The Knicks are 9-0 at home this season and 17-5 in all, the
best record in the NBA’s Eastern Conference. The game against
 Cleveland  (5-18) is the second of a six-game homestand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
