Denise Bode , chief executive officer
of the  American Wind Energy Association , will quit Jan. 1, the
day that tax credits for the industry are set to expire.  Rob Gramlich, currently senior vice president for public
policy, will take over her duties as interim CEO after she steps
down, according to a  statement  today from the Washington-based
trade group.  Bode was hired in January 2009 to help lock in federal and
state incentives for the wind industry. Congress has yet to act
on a one-year extension of the 2.2-cent-per-kilowatt-hour tax
credit. The expiration of the tax credit will cause the loss of
about 37,000 jobs, the industry group has said.  “Rob Gramlich will provide the steady hand needed to
represent the industry during this critical period,” Bode said
in the statement.  The tax credits for wind-energy producers have faced
repeated expirations during the past two decades, creating
uncertainty for turbine manufacturers including General Electric
Co. and Vestas Wind Energy Systems A/S.  Bode, a former lobbyist for the oil and natural gas
industry, plans to return to private practice as a tax lawyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
