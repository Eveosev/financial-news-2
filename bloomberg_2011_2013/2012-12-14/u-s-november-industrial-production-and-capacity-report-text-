Following is the text of the U.S.
 industrial production  and capacity utilization report.  Industrial production increased 1.1 percent in November
after having fallen 0.7 percent in October. The gain in November
is estimated to have largely resulted from a recovery in
production for industries that had been negatively affected by
Hurricane Sandy, which hit the Northeast region in late October.
In November, manufacturing output increased 1.1 percent after
having decreased 1.0 percent in October; in addition to the
storm-related rebound, a sizable rise in the production of motor
vehicles and parts boosted factory output in November. The
output of utilities advanced 1.0 percent, and production at
mines rose 0.8 percent. At 97.5 percent of its 2007 average,
total industrial production in November was 2.5 percent above
its year-earlier level.  Capacity utilization for total industry
increased 0.7 percentage point to 78.4 percent, a rate 1.9
percentage points below its long-run (1972-2011) average.  Market Groups  The production of  consumer goods  rose 1.2 percent in
November, reversing a decline of the same magnitude in October.
The output of durable consumer goods increased 2.8 percent in
November.  Among  durable consumer goods categories, the index
for automotive products rose 3.4 percent, its first increase  in
five months; the indexes for home electronics; for appliances,
furniture, and carpeting; and for  miscellaneous goods all
posted smaller increases.  The production of nondurable consumer
goods advanced 0.7 percent.  The index for consumer energy
products rose 0.9 percent after having fallen 0.7 percent in
October, and the index for non-energy nondurables increased 0.7
percent in November following a decline of 1.9 percent in
October.  Among non-energy nondurables, the output of foods and
tobacco, of clothing, and of paper products all registered
sizable gains in November, while the output of chemical products
edged down.  The output of business equipment moved up 1.2 percent in
November and was 7.4 percent above its year-earlier level.  The
production of transit equipment increased 2.5 percent, and the
production of industrial and other equipment rose 1.3 percent;
output in both categories stepped down noticeably in October.
The index for information processing equipment fell 0.4 percent
in November, but it remained 4.0 percent above its year-earlier
level.  The output of defense and space equipment was unchanged in
November after decreasing 1.9 percent in October; however, the
index stood 0.8 percent above its year-earlier level.  Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction
supplies increased 1.4 percent in November, its largest monthly
gain since February. The production of business supplies rose
0.7 percent in November following three consecutive months of
declines.  The output of materials to be processed further in the
industrial sector advanced 1.0 percent in November after having
edged down 0.1 percent in October.  The indexes for energy
materials and for durable materials posted sizable gains in
November, while the index for nondurable materials rose
moderately.  The output of durable materials increased 1.6
percent after three months of decreases.  The index for consumer
parts rose substantially, boosted in particular by motor
vehicle-related production, and stood 17.8 percent above its
year-earlier level; the output of equipment parts increased 0.3
percent in November after having moved down 0.5 percent in
October.  In November, the index for nondurable materials gained
0.4 percent; the indexes for textiles and for paper moved up,
while the production of chemicals was unchanged.  The output of
energy materials rose 0.9 percent.  Industry Groups  Manufacturing output rose 1.1 percent in November following
a decrease of 1.0 percent in October.  Nearly all the decline in
factory output in October is estimated to have been related to
 Hurricane Sandy , and the increase in November reflects a post-
hurricane rebound in production as well as the solid advance in
the output of motor vehicles and parts.  Within manufacturing,
increases were widespread in November across both durable and
nondurable goods industries.  The factory operating rate rose to
76.6 percent, a rate 2.2 percentage points below its long-run
average.  The production of durable goods rose 1.6 percent in
November. Output increased in all major categories of durables
other than computer and electronic products, and aerospace and
miscellaneous transportation equipment, which both decreased.
Gains of more than 2 percent were recorded in the indexes for
wood products; for primary metals; for electrical equipment,
appliances, and components; for motor vehicles and parts; and
for miscellaneous manufacturing.  Capacity utilization for
durable goods manufacturing was 76.7 percent, a rate 0.4
percentage point below its long-run average.  The output of nondurables rose 0.5 percent in November, and
it was 0.6 percent above its year-earlier level. For November,
most major categories of nondurables moved up, although the
indexes for petroleum and coal products and for chemicals edged
down.  Capacity utilization for nondurable manufacturing was
77.9 percent, a rate 3.0 percentage points below its long-run
average.  Production in the non-NAICS manufacturing industries
(logging and publishing) rose 1.3 percent in November after
having fallen 4.0 percent in October when the hurricane held
down the output of publishers.  In November, mining output advanced 0.8 percent. Capacity
utilization at mines moved up 0.5 percentage point to 91.1
percent, a rate 3.8 percentage points above its long-run
average.  The output of utilities rose 1.0 percent in November,
and gains were posted for both the electric and the natural gas
categories. The operating rate for utilities increased 0.6
percentage point to 75.3 percent, a rate 11.0 percentage points
below its long-run average.  Capacity utilization rates in November for industries
grouped by stage of process were as follows: At the  crude
stage, utilization increased 0.5 percentage point to 88.5
percent, a rate 2.2 percentage points above  its long-run
average; at the primary and semifinished stages, utilization
rose 0.9 percentage point to 75.8  percent, a rate 5.3
percentage points below its long-run average; and at the
finished stage, utilization  moved up 0.5 percentage point to
76.8 percent, a rate 0.4 percentage point lower than its long-
run average.  Notice
Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization  The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual
revision to the index of industrial production (IP) and the
related measures of capacity utilization at the end of March
2013. The revised IP indexes will incorporate detailed data from
the 2011 Annual Survey of Manufactures, conducted by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Annual data from the  U.S. Geological Survey 
regarding metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels) for
2011 will also be incorporated. The update will include
revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input
data) and to seasonal factors for each industry.  In addition,
the estimation methods for some series may be changed. Any
modifications to the methods for estimating the output of an
industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present.  Capacity and capacity utilization will be revised to
incorporate data through the fourth quarter of 2012 from the
Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity, which covers
manufacturing, along with new data on capacity from the U.S.
Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other
organizations.  Once the revision is published, it will be available on the
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. The 2013
release schedule, however, is available now on the website.  References and Release Dates
