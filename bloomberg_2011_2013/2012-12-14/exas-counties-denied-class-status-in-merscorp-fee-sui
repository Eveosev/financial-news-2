A federal judge denied a request by
 Texas  counties to proceed as a class in a lawsuit accusing
mortgage registry Merscorp Inc. of shortchanging them on filing
fees.  Merscorp contended “that Texas law does not permit a class
consisting of all Texas counties” and such a class “is
prohibited” under certain circumstances by federal rules of
civil procedure, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Dallas
said in an order filed yesterday.  O’Connor also canceled an evidentiary hearing set for Dec.
19, saying it wasn’t necessary because he threw out the class-
status request “on legal grounds.”  Dallas County filed the initial complaint in 2011, alleging
that Merscorp’s MERS registry was established by banks including
Charlotte, North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  to avoid
paying filing fees as well as to ease transfers of mortgages.  The lawsuit is  Dallas  County v. Merscorp Inc., 11-cv-02733,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
