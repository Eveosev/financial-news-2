JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  named Joyce Chang as its global head of fixed-income research, according to
an internal company memo seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by
London-based spokesman Patrick Burton.  Chang replaced Terry Belton, who was appointed the head of
global portfolio strategy in the bank’s chief investment office
last week, Burton said. Chang, who is based in New York, was
previously the company’s global head of emerging-market
research. In her new role, she will assume global responsibility
for foreign-exchange, rates, securitized-products and public-
finance research, the memo said.  John Normand’s role as the global head of foreign-exchange
strategy in London will be expanded to include interest-rate
strategy for Europe, Japan and Australia, according to the same
document. He will report to Chang, the memo showed.  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  has overhauled
management during a year marred by more than $6.2 billion in
losses at JPMorgan’s chief investment office. In July, he
combined treasury services with the corporate and investment
banks to create a new unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
