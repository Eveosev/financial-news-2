A bomb planted at the Bonn train
station that failed to explode may have been the work of an
Islamist terror group,  Germany ’s Federal Prosecutor’s Office
said.  The prosecutor’s office today took over the case from local
police and authorized the Federal Criminal Police Office to lead
the investigation, according to an e-mailed statement.  “There are sufficient leads suggesting that the incident
was an attempted bombing attack of a terrorist group of radical-
Islamists,” the Federal Prosecutor said.  Bonn’s main train station was temporarily shut on Dec. 10
after a man left an explosive device that police defused with a
water jet. The device was made of a 40-centimeter (16-inch)
metal pipe filled with ammonium nitrate, with four pressurized
gas cartridges, an alarm clock and batteries intended to set it
off, the prosecutor’s office said. It wasn’t clear why the
device didn’t explode, according to the statement.  “We are taking this issue very seriously,” Interior
Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  said in a statement today. “It
underlines our assessment that Germany is the target of jihadist
terrorism.”  A manhunt is underway for two people suspected of planting
the bomb, one fair-skinned and one dark-skinned, Cologne Police
Chief Wolfgang Albers said Dec. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
