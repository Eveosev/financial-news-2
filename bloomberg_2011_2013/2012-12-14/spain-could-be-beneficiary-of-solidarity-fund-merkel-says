German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
cited  Spain  as a potential beneficiary of a proposed European
fund to channel cash to countries that pledge to spur
competitiveness.  European governments that sign up to policy measures to
curb debt while improving vocational training and boosting
research and development spending would be eligible recipients
under the proposal discussed by European Union leaders at a two-
day meeting in Brussels that ended today.  “All this has to be clarified in detail and worked on over
the next six months,” Merkel said. The chancellor told
reporters earlier today she envisages a pool of “around 10 ($13
billion) or 15 or 20 billion euros,” or around 0.2 percent of
the euro region’s gross domestic product.  The so-called solidarity fund could be fed by national
contributions such as proceeds from a financial transaction tax
or some of the European Union’s so-called structural funds,
Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
