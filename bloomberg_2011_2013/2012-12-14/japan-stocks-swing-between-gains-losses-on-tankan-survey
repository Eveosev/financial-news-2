Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  index rose for a third
day, climbing above 800 for the first time since April, after
the yen weakened to a nine-month low and a gauge of Chinese
manufacturing beat estimates.  Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction equipment that has
benefited from China’s building boom, added 1 percent. Sharp
Corp. jumped 7.6 percent after a loan provider said it may set
limits on margin trades for the television maker’s shares.
 Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , a maker of industrial machinery, dropped 2.1
percent after a central bank survey showed Japan’s biggest
manufacturers were the most pessimistic in almost three years.  The Topix, a broad gauge of Japanese shares, gained 0.2
percent to close at 801.04 in  Tokyo , its highest level since
April 27. The measure has advanced 11 percent since Nov. 14,
when the ruling party said it would call elections for this
weekend, with bets an opposition party calling for more monetary
easing will win.  “We can expect inflation, a weaker yen and a gain in
stocks from the Japanese election,” said Michiya Tomita, a Hong
Kong-based fund manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co.,
which oversees $70 billion. “China’s economy is showing signs
of a recovery.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 0.1 percent to
9,737.56 today after a technical indicator signaled shares may
be overbought. The gauge’s 14-day  relative strength index , an
indicator of trading momentum, rose to 75.7, its highest since
March 19. Some traders view a reading above 70 as a signal
shares may fall.  Annual Performance  Japan’s benchmark is headed for a 15 percent gain this
year, its best annual performance since 2009, when the measure
increased 19 percent. The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index
rose 2 percent to 19.49 today, indicating traders expect a swing
of about 5.6 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30
days.  Shares linked to  China  reversed earlier declines after a
report showed manufacturing may expand in the country at a
faster pace this month.  Komatsu, which gets about 14 percent of its sales from
China, advanced 1 percent to 1,935 yen. Fanuc Corp., a maker of
robots used in mainland factories, climbed 0.3 percent to 15,040
yen, reversing earlier declines of 1 percent.  A purchasing managers’ index released today in China by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed December’s
preliminary reading was 50.9, compared with the 50.8 estimate
from economists in a Bloomberg survey. November’s final reading
was 50.5, the first time in 13 months it was above the
expansion-contraction threshold of 50.  Yen Weakens  The yen fell to the weakest level since March against the
dollar on bets that Shinzo Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party will
win elections on Dec. 16. The LDP and a coalition partner are
poised to win more than 300 of parliament’s 480 lower house
seats, a Kyodo News poll showed yesterday. Abe has called on the
Bank of Japan to provide “unlimited easing” and set an
inflation target of at least 2 percent.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which receives more than 80 percent of its
sales from outside Japan, increased 0.2 percent to 2,829 yen.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 0.6 percent
to 3,160 yen. Sony Corp., which receives 19 percent of its
revenue from the U.S., advanced 2.3 percent to 906 yen.  Among other stocks that rose, Sharp jumped 7.6 percent to
269 yen. Japan Securities Finance Co., which provides loans for
margin transactions, said it may set a limit for margin trades
in Sharp.  The Tankan  Stocks dropped earlier after the Bank of Japan’s quarterly
Tankan index for large manufacturers fell to minus 12 in
December from minus 3 in September. The reading, the lowest
since March 2010, compared with economists’ estimates for minus
10 in Bloomberg News survey. A negative number means pessimists
outnumber optimists.  Hitachi fell 2.1 percent to 472 yen, the second-biggest
decline on the Nikkei 225.  Olympus Corp. (7733) ,  a maker of
endoscopes, lost 2.4 percent to 1,373 yen. Dainippon Screen
Manufacturing Co., which manufacturers equipment used in
producing semiconductors, sank 1.6 percent to 492 yen.  The Topix trades at 0.95 times book value, compared with
2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can
be bought for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
