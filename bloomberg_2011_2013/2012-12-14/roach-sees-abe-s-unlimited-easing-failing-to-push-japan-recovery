Japanese opposition leader Shinzo Abe is focusing on the wrong tool for boosting the economy by 
urging unlimited monetary easing, according to Stephen Roach, 
former non-executive chairman for Morgan Stanley Asia.  “Quantitative easing, which they should have learned long
ahead of everybody, doesn’t help drive a cyclical recovery,”
Roach, 67, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview in
Hong Kong. “What he wants he may get, but that doesn’t mean
it’s going to work.”  Abe is pressing for more action to end deflation and boost
an economy in its third recession in five years, including
urging a 2 percent inflation target, up from the central bank’s
existing 1 percent goal. JPMorgan Chase & Co. forecasts a 10
trillion yen ($119 billion) expansion of the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
asset-purchase program at a meeting that ends on Dec. 20, four
days after the election.  “Weak, recovering economies are vulnerable to relapses --
that’s the bottom line,” said Roach, who lectures at Yale
University in New Haven,  Connecticut , including teaching a
course on economic policy lessons from Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
