Born into a rich English family,
William Duer settled in  New York  in 1769. By 1780 he was worth
almost $2 million and was socially well-connected:  George Washington  gave his bride away.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In 1792, though, Duer voluntarily entered the New Gaol, a
debtor’s prison in downtown New York, to escape his creditors.
He had borrowed money to corner the market on U.S. bonds and
couldn’t cover his losses.  In addition to his prominent associates, Duer had hit up
shopkeepers, widows, orphans, butchers and even the famous bawd
Mrs. Macarty. All were ruined.  For days, an angry crowd gathered outside the prison,
cursing Duer, threatening vengeance, throwing stones and
rioting. With his fall, a financial panic ensued, the nation’s
first, with Duer the most reviled deadbeat.  I spoke with Scott Reynolds Nelson, author of “A Nation of
Deadbeats: An Uncommon History of America’s Financial
Disasters,” on the following topics:  1. Consumer Debt  2. Periodic Crashes  3. Unsteady Borrowers  4. Shady Operators  5. Birth of Democrats  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
former editor of Harper’s magazine. He hosts “The World in
Time” interview series for  Bloomberg News .)  To contact the writer on the story:
