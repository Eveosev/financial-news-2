Oil may fall toward $80 a barrel as
prices failed to close above the 50-day moving average for a
seventh day, according to technical analysis from EOXLive.  Oil futures in New York settled below the average on Dec. 5
and have since traded under it, indicating that oil is facing
pressure to breach the average, said Tom Pawlicki, director of
market research at the Chicago-based commodity-trading firm.
Prices may move toward the November low of $84.05, and a break
below that level will probably send the futures to $80, he said.  “We are going to continue to see pressure around the 50-
day moving average area,” he said. “Right now we have a target
at $84.05 but once that’s removed then $80 comes into play.”  When futures breached the average on Sept. 19, prices
dropped from a intraday high of $96.17 to $84.05 on Nov. 7.  Oil for January delivery slid 88 cents, or 1 percent, to
settle at $85.89 a barrel yesterday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Futures have dropped 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
