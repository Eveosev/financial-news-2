Eletropaulo Metropolitana SA, the
Brazilian distribution unit of  AES Corp. (AES) , fell to a record low
after a court ordered the electric utility to pay off a loan
worth almost half the company’s market value.  Shares slid 5.5 percent to 13.23 reais at close in Sao
Paulo and earlier dropped 9.3 percent to an intraday record. It
was the biggest decliner on the benchmark Bovespa index, which
rose 0.5 percent.  A court in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro ordered
Eletropaulo to pay off a loan from  Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  that was taken out in 1986, according to a
regulatory filing today. The amount may total 1.3 billion reais
($630 million), Eletropaulo said in the filing. The company said
it will appeal the decision and sees “good chances” of
succeeding.  “Although this decision is not final, we believe it
represents a setback for Eletropaulo,” Vladimir Pinto and
Marcelo Sa, analysts at the investment bank Bradesco BBI, wrote
in a report. They have a recommendation equivalent to hold on
the stock, with a 12-month price target of 24.27 reais.  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, a state-controlled utility
known as Eletrobras, rose 1.5 percent to 9.74 reais.  Eletropaulo has a market capitalization of 2.9 billion
reais after the stock tumbled 64 percent this year amid a push
by President Dilma Rousseff to cut power rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
