Euro-area inflation  slowed in
November as energy-price growth eased and the economy remained
mired in its second recession in four years.  The annual  inflation rate  in the 17-nation currency bloc
fell to 2.2 percent, in line with an initial estimate on Nov.
30, from 2.5 percent in October, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today. In the month, prices fell 0.2
percent.  The European Central Bank last week left its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent even as
President Mario Draghi said risks for the euro-area economy led
policy makers to debate a reduction. The ECB forecasts gross
domestic product will fall 0.5 percent this year and sees
inflation for the year at 2.5 percent.  The core inflation rate, excluding volatile costs such as
energy, alcohol and tobacco, dipped to 1.4 percent in November,
today’s report showed. Energy costs rose 5.7 percent after an 8
percent increase in October.  Two successive quarters of contraction through September in
the euro area are weighing on demand and stifling employment,
which declined 0.2 percent in the third quarter after stagnating
in the previous three months, a separate report showed today.  Europe ’s biggest airline,  Air France-KLM Group (AF) , said on
Dec. 10 that it will reduce employee expenses by 400 million
euros ($524 million) and capital spending by a further 500
million euros in the next two years to pare debt and expand
profit margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
