U.S. nuclear power generation  fell
for a fourth day as Constellation Energy Group Inc. shut the
smaller of two reactors at the Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station
in  New York .  Production dropped 0.2 percent to 89,100 megawatts, or 87
percent of capacity, according to Nuclear Regulatory Commission
data compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 5.5 percent lower than a
 year earlier , with 12 of 104 U.S. reactors offline.  Constellation halted the 621-megawatt Nine Mile Point 1,
located 6 miles (10 kilometers) northeast of Oswego, after
operators noticed signs of air leakage from the unit’s drywell,
part of its primary containment system.  The unit ran at full capacity yesterday but began to shut
down around 4:45 p.m. yesterday and was taken off the grid by
7:10 p.m. The plant is stable and poses no risk to the public or
employees, said Jill Lyon, a Constellation spokeswoman based in
Scriba, New York.  “This was an orderly shutdown of the unit and did not meet
any of the criteria for an emergency classification,” Lyon said
in an e-mail.  Browns Ferry  The  Tennessee Valley Authority ’s Browns Ferry 2, a 1,104-
megawatt reactor 84 miles north of Birmingham,  Alabama , boosted
output to 98 percent of capacity from 48 percent yesterday.  LaSalle 2,  Exelon Corp. (EXC) ’s 1,120-megawatt reactor 70 miles
southwest of  Chicago , declined to 80 percent of capacity from 98
percent.  Nebraska Public Power District’s Cooper 1 unit boosted
output to 100 percent of its 830-megawatt capacity and Pacific
Gas & Electric Co.’s 1,149-megawatt Diablo Canyon 2 lowered
output to 65 percent of capacity.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
