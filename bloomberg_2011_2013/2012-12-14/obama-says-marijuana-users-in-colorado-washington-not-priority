President  Barack Obama  said federal
law enforcement authorities have “bigger fish to fry” than
prosecution of marijuana users in the two states where voters
decriminalized recreational use in last month’s election.  “It would not make sense for us to see a top priority as
going after recreational users in states that have determined
that it’s legal,” the president said in a recorded  interview 
with ABC News scheduled for broadcast tonight.  Voters in Colorado and Washington approved ballot measures
legalizing the possession of up to one ounce (28 grams) of
marijuana. The drug remains illegal under federal law.  Medical use of marijuana is permitted in 17 states and the
 District of Columbia .  Obama told ABC he doesn’t support broader legalization of
marijuana “at this point.” He said public opinion has been
shifting and the federal government has limited resources to
pursue users.  “What we’re going to need to have is a conversation
about,” he said, is “how do you reconcile a federal law that
still says marijuana is a federal offense and state laws that
say that it’s legal?”  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday the
 Justice Department  will announce “relatively soon” its policy
on the state measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
