China’s stocks  jumped the most since
October 2009 on speculation state-backed institutions were
buying shares as a manufacturing survey added to optimism the
world’s second-largest economy will rebound.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 4.3 percent to
2,150.63 at the close, with trading volumes more the double the
30-day average. A gauge tracking financial companies surged 6.7
percent as brokerages jumped on signs the government will allow
more funds to buy equities.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  led a rally
by industrial companies after a preliminary reading for a
factory output index rose.  “It looks like institutional investors are re-entering the
market and they have to increase their stock positions now in
order not to miss the boat,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at
Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in  Shanghai , which
manages $190 million. “The economy has stabilized.”  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  surged 5.1 percent to 2,355.86, with all
10 industry groups adding more than 2.4 percent. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
rose 1.4 percent to a nine-month high. The  IShares FTSE A50
China Index ETF (2823) , which mimics the performance of the 50 biggest
A share companies, jumped 4.5 percent in Hong Kong.  The Shanghai Composite has advanced 4.3 percent this week,
the biggest gain in 13 months and extending last week’s 4.1
percent rally. Shares have rebounded 9.7 percent from an almost
four-year low reached on Dec. 3. The gauge is still down 2.2
percent this year, heading for a third straight annual loss.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
