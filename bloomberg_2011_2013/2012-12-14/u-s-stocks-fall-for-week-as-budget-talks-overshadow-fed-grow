U.S. stocks  had their first weekly
decline in a month as budget talks dragged on, overshadowing the
 Federal Reserve ’s plan to expand bond purchases and better-than-
estimated economic data.  Consumer companies fell the most among 10 groups in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index as analysts cut ratings for  Family
Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO)  and Priceline.com Inc.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  sank 4.4
percent after UBS AG and Jefferies & Co. lowered their share-
price estimates.  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and DuPont Co. each
climbed 2.1 percent amid optimism over share buybacks. An index
of steelmakers rallied 7 percent as economic data beat forecasts
in China, the world’s biggest buyer of industrial metals.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.3 percent to 1,413.58, snapping a three-
week gain. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  declined 20.12
points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,135.01 for the week.  “The market would love for a fiscal cliff deal to be
announced, then it would trend back to really the fundamentals,
which are actually looking better,” David Chalupnik, head of
equities at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a
phone interview. His firm manages $112 billion. “Time is
running out here pretty quickly for certainly a grand bargain
type of deal.”  President  Barack Obama  and Republican House Speaker  John
Boehner  remained deadlocked during their third White House
meeting on next year’s budget. More than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts are scheduled to start taking effect
in January unless Congress acts to avert them.  Economic Reports  Government reports showed retail sales and industrial
production rebounded in November while jobless claims declined
to a nine-week low. The Fed said it will buy $45 billion a month
of  Treasury securities  starting in January to help boost growth,
in addition to $40 billion a month of mortgage-debt purchases
under a previous plan. Asset buying will continue until the
labor market improve “substantially,” the central bank said.  Three rounds of bond purchases from the Fed have helped the
 S&P 500 (SPX)  more than double from a 12-year low in 2009. While the
benchmark gauge is up 12 percent this year, it’s fallen 1.9
percent this quarter, worse than any other developed market
among 24 tracked by Bloomberg.  “The fiscal cliff is creating value in equities as there
is too much negativity priced in,” said Scott Minerd, chief
investment officer of Guggenheim Partners LLC, who oversees more
than $125 billion from  Santa Monica , California. “I’m of the
mindset that the fiscal cliff is a non-event.”  Consumer Stocks  Consumer-discretionary shares in the S&P 500 fell 1.2
percent for the week, the most among 10 industry groups.  Family Dollar slumped 7.2 percent to $65.86 as JPMorgan
Chase & Co. reduced its rating for the discount retailer to
neutral, an equivalent of hold, from overweight, citing
increased competition.  Dollar General  Corp., the largest U.S.
dollar-store chain, said it will match rivals’ price cuts to
retain customers that analysts anticipate will spend more
cautiously next year. Dollar General lost 6.4 percent to $43.83.  Priceline.com declined 6.9 percent to $613.54. The online
travel agency was cut to hold from buy at Deutsche Bank AG on
concern competition in the industry may heat up next year.  Apple tumbled 4.4 percent to $509.79. Steven Milunovich, an
analyst at UBS, cut his price estimate to $700 from $780, citing
concern that growth may slow for the iPhone and iPad. Based on
checks with Apple’s suppliers, Milunovich said that the company
is starting to curb production of the iPhone.  Peter Misek  at
Jefferies trimmed his forecast to $800 from $900.  Berkshire Hathaway  Berkshire climbed 2.1 percent to $89.15. The company said
it will pay as much as 120 percent of book value, a measure of
assets minus liabilities, for stock buybacks, signaling Chief
Executive Officer  Warren Buffett  views the shares as
undervalued. The previous limit was 110 percent.  DuPont advanced 2.1 percent to $44.09. The biggest U.S.
chemical maker by market value said 2012 earnings will reach the
upper end of the company’s forecast and it will spend as much as
$1 billion to repurchase shares.  An S&P 500 index of  steelmakers  rallied 7 percent for the
biggest weekly gain since September as data from China showed
factory output and retail sales beat economists’ estimates while
manufacturing may expand at a faster pace.  U.S. Steel Corp., the country’s largest producer of the
metal by volume, jumped 9.6 percent to $23.85. Cliffs Natural
Resources Inc., the largest U.S. iron-ore producer, surged 15
percent to $33.96.  TripAdvisor Inc. advanced 8 percent to $41.67. Liberty
Interactive Corp. bought about $300 million in shares of the
online travel-review company, gaining voting control from
billionaire  Barry Diller , who stepped down as its chairman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
