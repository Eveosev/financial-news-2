Azerbaijan’s inflation rate fell to
1.2 percent in the first 11 months of 2012 from 8 percent a year
earlier, the State Statistics Committee, based in the capital,
Baku, said today on its  website .  Slowing consumer prices led the energy-rich Caspian Sea
nation’s central bank to cut its benchmark interest rate a
quarter-point to 5 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
