Azerbaijan pumped less crude oil in
the first 11 months of the year and increased production of
marketable natural gas, the State Statistics Committee said.  The Caspian Sea nation cut oil production 6.8 percent to
39.4 million metric tons in January through November, the Baku-
based committee said late yesterday on its  website . No reason
was given for the decline.  The BP Plc-led Caspian field of Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli,
which accounted for 78 percent of total output last year,
delivered 12 percent less oil in the first half, drawing
criticism of the U.K producer by Azeri President Ilham Aliyev in
October.  Azerbaijan also pumped 15.7 billion cubic meters of
marketable gas from January to November, an increase of 6.3
percent from the year-earlier period, the Statistics Committee
said.  The former Soviet republic exports gas to Russia, Georgia
and  Turkey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
