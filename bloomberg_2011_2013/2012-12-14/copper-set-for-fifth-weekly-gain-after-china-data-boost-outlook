Copper advanced, set for the best
weekly run in more than a year, after data showed  China ’s
manufacturing may expand at a faster pace, adding to signs that
demand in the world’s top metals buyer is recovering.  The contract for delivery in three months gained 0.3
percent to $8,095 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 4
p.m. in Seoul. The price is up 0.8 percent this week, poised for
a fifth such gain. That’s the longest winning streak since July
29, 2011. The March-delivery contract increased 0.8 percent to
$3.688 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  The preliminary December reading was 50.9 for a purchasing
managers’ index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. That compares with the 50.8 median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 12 economists and a final reading of
50.5 for November, the first time in 13 months it was above the
expansion-contraction division line of 50.  “The China data came out a good read,” Hwang Il Doo, head
of metals trading at  Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  Futures Co., said by
phone today from Seoul. “We expect  China’s economy  will recover
next year as Xi Jinping needs to keep growth momentum on track.
Prices are well supported at $8,000 and can take off.”  The metal gained 6.5 percent this year. Stockpiles
monitored by the LME yesterday rose for a sixth session to
269,875 tons, the highest since March 14. Copper yesterday fell
by the most in two weeks in intraday trading on concern U.S.
lawmakers will fail to reach a budget compromise, triggering
$600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  The contract for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
close at 57,840  yuan  ($9,273) a ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. On the LME, nickel, zinc and lead also gained, while
aluminum and tin were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
