Alexza Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ALXA)  gained
the most in four months after the European Union drug regulator
recommended the company’s schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
medicine for approval.  Alexza, based in  Mountain View ,  California ,  rose  11 percent
to $5.84 at the close in  New York , the biggest single-day gain
since August. The company fell 37 percent this year before
today.  The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use recommended Alexza’s Adasuve be marketed
in the EU for the rapid control of mild-to-moderate agitation in
adult patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, the
company said today in a statement. The European Commission is
expected to make a decision on marketing approval by the first
quarter of 2013, according to the statement.  “We believe that Adasuve may provide an important new
therapeutic option as the first rapid and non-invasive treatment
to address episodes of agitation,” James Cassella, executive
vice president and chief scientific officer of Alexza, said.  The committee also recommended the drug only be
administered in a hospital setting under the supervision of a
health-care professional.  The agency’s recommendations are the final stage before the
European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, approves or rejects
a drug for sale to patients in the 27-nation region. The
commission usually follows the EMA’s recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
