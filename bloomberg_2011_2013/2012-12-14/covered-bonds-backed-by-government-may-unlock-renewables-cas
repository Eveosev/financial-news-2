Covered bonds, a financing mechanism
used primarily for mortgages, are getting promoted to fund
clean-energy projects to raise the estimated $1 trillion a year
in new private capital needed to keep emissions at safe levels.  Issuing public sector-guaranteed bonds would enable the
securities industry to build experience in gauging financial
performance for renewable-energy assets without direct exposure
to underlying credit risks, according to a  report  published
today from the Climate Bond Initiative, a group advocating new
ways to finance clean energy projects.  “Covered bonds have proven to be a reliable source of
term-dated funds for banks,” Frank Damerow, an author of the
report, said in an e-mailed statement. “Banks would benefit
from issuing renewable-energy covered bonds as it would give
them access to a wider pool of term-dated funds with which they
could increase their lending activities.”  An additional $1 trillion a year of investment in low-
carbon transport and buildings as well as renewable energy is
needed to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions to a safe level, the
report showed, citing the International Energy Agency. About
$260 billion was invested in renewable energy last year, London-
based Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  Covered bonds, backed by borrowers’ assets and usually
carrying lower costs than unsecured bank debt, may provide a
platform in the development of a wider bond market for renewable
energy, according to the report. They enable banks access to
cheaper, longer-term funds to lend to renewable energy projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
