A  Georgia  envoy said a first
informal meeting with  Russia  was “satisfactory,” as the two
countries agreed to start a new dialogue following the change of
power in Georgia in October.  Zurab Abashidze, the Georgian prime minister’s special
representative for relations with Russia, met with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin today in Switzerland,
which acts as a mediator between the two nations, the Interpress
news agency reported.  Georgia and Russia broke diplomatic relations after their
August 2008 war.  Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, shortly after
his victory in parliamentary elections, named Abashidze special
envoy in November. Abashidze previously served as Georgia’s
ambassador in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
