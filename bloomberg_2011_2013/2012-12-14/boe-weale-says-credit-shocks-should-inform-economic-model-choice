Bank of England  policy maker  Martin Weale  said the role of credit shocks in the financial crisis
should inform economists’ choice of models for understanding the
turmoil.  “It seems to me unlikely that a model based on a
representative agent can deal satisfactorily with the effects of
credit constraints or fears about availability of credit,” he
said in a speech today in Wellington,  New Zealand .  Officials should instead prefer disaggregate models, which
represent the economy as a collection of individual households
in different circumstances, Weale said.  “Tightening of credit and fear of tight credit has
affected both firms and households and, in the U.K. at least,
this may be limiting the scope for recovery,” he said. “The
development of models of this type is going to help us
understand the nature of the shocks which have affected the
international economy over the last five years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
