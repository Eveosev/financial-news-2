(Corrects identity of suspect in first paragraph.)  Two law enforcement officials who
initially identified a suspect in the Connecticut elementary
school shooting now say they’re uncertain of the gunman’s name.  The two officials asked for anonymity because of a
continuing investigation. The suspect and his mother were dead
at the scene, Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
