New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg dismissed as nonsense City Comptroller John C. Liu’s
effort to stop a deal the city has made with  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  to
provide a new model of taxi cab.  The New York Times reported last night that Liu will
announce today that he won’t approve the contract, citing people
familiar with the matter who weren’t identified. Liu has been
critical of the deal since it was announced last year because
the so-called Taxi of Tomorrow isn’t wheelchair accessible.  “It isn’t worth spending a lot of time trying to decipher
why some of these things are done,” the mayor said today on his
weekly show on WOR radio. “I’m not here to assassinate anybody,
but it doesn’t make a lot of sense. In fact it doesn’t matter.
We can go ahead and do it anyways, which we will.”  The City Charter allows the mayor to override objections to
contracts by the comptroller, the Times said, citing legal
analysts.  Liu has scheduled a press conference for 11:15 a.m. on the
topic, though his office hasn’t provided more detail.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
