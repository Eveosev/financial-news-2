India ’s 10-year bond yields were
near a seven-week low on speculation the central bank will cut
lenders’ reserve  requirements  for a fifth time this year to pump
funds into markets, spurring demand for debt.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the proportion of
deposits banks must set aside as reserves by 25 basis points to
4 percent on Dec. 18, according to 13 of 17 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. One predicted a 50 basis point reduction,
while the rest expect no change. The RBI bought 116 billion
rupees ($2.1 billion) of notes at an open-market auction this
week. India will report today inflation accelerated to 7.6
percent last month from 7.45 percent in October, a separate
survey showed.  “Liquidity concerns are continuing,” said Harihar Krishnamoorthy, Mumbai-based treasurer at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s India
unit. “In addition to the open-market purchases, the RBI may
focus on injecting cash through a reserve-ratio cut.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was at
8.165 percent as of 9:16 a.m., according to the central bank’s
trading system. It was at 8.159 percent yesterday, the lowest
level since Oct. 29. The yield is little changed this week.  The monetary authority last cut the reserve ratio by 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, on Oct. 30, taking the
total reduction this year to 175 basis points. The RBI has
released more than 2.7 trillion rupees into the financial system
this year via steps including reserve reductions and securities
purchases to spur  Asia ’s third-largest economy, which expanded
last quarter at the slowest pace since 2009.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed today at 7.67 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
It rose two basis points this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
