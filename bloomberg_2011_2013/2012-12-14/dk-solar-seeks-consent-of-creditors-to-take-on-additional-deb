LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , a Chinese solar
manufacturer that owes more than $3.1 billion, is seeking
consent from investors to take on more debt.  The company will offer noteholders 10  yuan  ($1.60) for
every 10,000 yuan they hold in its notes due in 2014, Xinyu,
China-based LDK said today in a filing. The payment would come
with conditions, including allowing LDK to take on more debt.  The filing follows LDK’s announcement on Dec. 12 that it
hired Citigroup Inc. to assist in improving working capital and
getting flexibility from creditors, said Edwin Mok, an analyst
at Needham & Co. in San Francisco.  “They are doing whatever they can to keep up liquidity,”
Mok said. “It’s not like they’ve actually gotten the debt.”  LDK’s 10 percent yuan notes due February 2014 traded at
57.4 percent of face value in  Singapore , after reaching 26.2
percent on Sept. 17.  By accepting the payment, creditors will consent to various
conditions, including approval for LDK to issue as much as $200
million in convertible preferred shares, and to take on as much
as $350 million in additional debt to increase production and
fund the development of solar farms.  Consent from holders representing the majority of the
principal amount held must occur before Dec. 21 for the
amendments and payments to be made, LDK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
