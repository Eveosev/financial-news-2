USI Insurance Services LLC set the
final terms on a $1.03 billion covenant-lite term loan B backing
its buyout by Onex Corp., according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction.   The seven-year debt will pay interest at 4 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.25
percent floor, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private.   The  interest rate  will decline to 3.75 percentage points
more than Libor when leverage, or the ratio of debt to earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is at
6.25 times total, the person said.      The loan will be sold at 99.5 cents on the dollar, the
person said, reducing proceeds for the company and boosting the
yield to investors.      The interest on the loan will increase if USI sells
incremental debt at a higher yield, said the person. Under a so-
called most-favored-nation clause, the spread on the financing
may be increased by as much as 50 basis points. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Royal Bank of  Canada  and UBS AG are
arranging the financing and commitments are due today by 11 a.m.
in  New York , with allocations expected after that, person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
