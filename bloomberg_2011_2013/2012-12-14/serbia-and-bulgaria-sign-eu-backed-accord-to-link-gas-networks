Serbia and Bulgaria plan to build a
 gas pipeline  between their countries to improve energy security
under a European Union-backed agreement signed in Brussels
today.  The 180-kilometer (112 mile) link may cost 120 million
euros ($157 million) and open by 2017, providing the two
countries, which rely on Russian gas, with an alternative route
for gas imports, the Serb government said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
