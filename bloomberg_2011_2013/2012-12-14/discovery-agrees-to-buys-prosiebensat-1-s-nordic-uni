Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA)  agreed
to buy 12 television networks from German broadcaster
 ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM)  for $1.7 billion, its largest
acquisition, as the owner of the Animal Planet cable network
looks to expand its international unit.  Discovery, based in  Silver Spring , Maryland, beat out other
bidders for the ProSiebenSat.1’s SBS Nordic unit, which
comprises television networks in Norway, Sweden,  Denmark  and
 Finland . Discovery also announced it’s buying a 20 percent stake
in  Societe Television Francaise 1 (TFI) ’s Eurosport channel for $221.6
million in a partnership that would allow it to potentially take
full ownership after two years.  Discovery, which owns TLC and has a joint partnership with
 Oprah Winfrey ’s OWN cable network, is adding channels and
programming in new markets to counter slowing growth in the U.S.
The company gets about half its revenue from ads, with the rest
coming from rights fees from pay-TV operators. Its international
business, which accounts for a little more than a third of
annual sales, is growing faster than its U.S. business, said
Chief Executive Officer  David Zaslav .  “We were already the largest pay-TV programmer in the
world outside the U.S., and this transaction makes us even
bigger,” Zaslav said in an interview today after the deal was
announced.  Largest Acquisition  Discovery  rose  0.9 percent to $60.82 at the close in  New
York . ProSiebenSat.1 advanced 1.8 percent to 23.66 euros in
Frankfurt trading.  In 2010, Discovery bought the 50 percent it didn’t own in
Animal Planet from BBC Worldwide for about $150 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Three years earlier, it
spent $250 million to acquire the website HowStuffWorks.com,
according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations at the
time.  Discovery has been looking overseas and into new
technologies for growth. Earlier this year, it acquired online-
video startup Revision3 for an undisclosed amount as part of a
strategy to own and distribute reality programming. The company
also bought a 20 percent stake in Televista, a French pay-TV
company specializing in the female lifestyle market.  ‘Good Deal’  ProSiebenSat.1, controlled by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and Permira
Advisers LLP, already sold its Dutch and Belgian broadcasting
units in April 2011 to slash debt.  “It’s obviously a good deal” for ProSiebenSat.1, said
Omar Sheikh, an analyst at Credit Suisse in  London . “People
were looking for $1.2 billion. The fact that they’re paying out
so much helps too.”  ProSiebenSat.1 plans to propose to pay a total 1.2 billion
euros ($1.6 billion) in dividends, or 5.60 euros a share, at its
July 2013 shareholder meeting, it said in a statement. That
compares with a payout of about 245 million euros for the
current year, it said. The decision was coordinated with Lavena,
the holding company set up by KKR and Permira.  Germany’s largest private broadcaster, which is based near
Munich, also plans to propose a conversion of non-voting shares
to common stock, which will require a 75 percent majority at the
shareholder meeting. Such a move would facilitate an eventual
exit for KKR and Permira. The company also said it plans to use
500 million euros from the sale to repay debt.  ProSiebenSat.1 had said in August that it was evaluating
interest in its Nordic assets after adviser  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
was approached by bidders. The Nordic region generated about 476
million euros in revenue in 2011, or 17 percent of
ProSiebenSat.1’s sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The transaction is subject to regulatory review and is
expected to close in early 2013, the companies said.  Discovery also announced it would add $1 billion to the
remaining $500 million on its share repurchase program.  Last month, Discovery’s third-quarter earnings missed
analysts’ estimates and the company also narrowed its annual
operating income forecast, excluding certain items, to as much
as $2.15 billion, compared with up to $2.2 billion before.  To contact the reporters on this story:
