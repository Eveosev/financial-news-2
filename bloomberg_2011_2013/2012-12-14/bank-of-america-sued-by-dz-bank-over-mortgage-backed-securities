Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, was sued by a clearinghouse for
cooperative banks in  Germany  over $546 million in residential
mortgage-backed securities.  DZ Bank , based in Frankfurt, filed the suit today in  New
York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It has taken similar
actions this year in the same court against other banks,
including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings
Plc, UBS AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  DZ Bank is one of two clearing organizations for Germany’s
cooperative banks, allowing it to provide structured products
directly to more than 900 local lenders. It accused Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America of making “material
misrepresentations and omissions” regarding the underwriting
standards used to issue the loans, according to a court filing.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, declined
to comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail.  The case is Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank AG v.  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) , 654378/2012, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
