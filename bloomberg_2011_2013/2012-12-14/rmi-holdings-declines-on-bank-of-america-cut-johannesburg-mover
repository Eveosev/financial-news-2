RMI Holdings Ltd. (RMI) , a South African
investor in insurance companies, fell after Bank of America cut
its recommendation to underperform from neutral.  The stock  declined  as much as 4.3 percent, the most in a
month on an intra-day basis, to 21.85 rand and traded at 22.05
rand at 12:25 p.m. in Johannesburg. About 1.1 million shares, or
61 percent of the daily average over the last three months,
changed hands.  “The stock has been doing very good this year,” Ryan Wibberley, a trader at Investec Asset Management, said by phone
from  Cape Town . “The cut has given investors cause to lock in
some profits.”  RMI, which has stakes in short-term insurer OUTsurance
Holdings Ltd. and medical insurer,  Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY) ,
gained 69 percent since the start of the year, making it the
third-best performer in the 50-member FTSE/JSE Africa Financials
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
