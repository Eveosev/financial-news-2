Bank of New York Mellon Corp ., the
world’s largest custody bank, named Karen B. Peetz president, a
title previously held by Chief Executive Officer Gerald L.
Hassell.  The New York-based bank also named Timothy F. Keaney chief
executive officer of investment services and Brian T. Shea
president of investment services. All three executives have been
with the bank for more than a decade and will continue to report
to Hassell, BNY Mellon said in a statement today.  “Together they will join me and our entire management team
as we focus on enhancing revenue growth across all economic
cycles,” Hassell said in the statement.  Peetz, currently vice chairman and chief executive officer
of financial markets and treasury services, joined the bank in
1998. Before that she spent 16 years with New York-based
JPMorgan Chase & Co. in a variety of roles.  BNY Mellon has $28 trillion of assets under custody and
manages $1.4 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
