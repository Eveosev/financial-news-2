Tribune Co., the bankrupt owner of
the  Chicago Tribune , Los Angeles Times and six other daily
newspapers, has abandoned plans to develop a tablet for
subscribers after struggling to make the necessary software,
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Developers have failed to create software that runs
smoothly on the MediaPad tablets from Huawei Technologies Co.,
 China ’s largest maker of phone equipment, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the plans are private.  Tribune had been conducting trials using Huawei hardware
loaded with custom applications highlighting content from the
media company’s largest newspapers. The tests were due to be
completed by the end of May this year, James Jiang, executive
vice president of product solutions at Huawei’s device business
in the U.S., said at the time.  The Los Angeles Times sent a companywide e-mail this week
offering to give away 100 tablets that were being used in
testing as an incentive for completing performance reviews,
according to a copy of the message obtained by Bloomberg.  Tribune Chief Executive Officer Eddy Hartenstein had sought
to use tablets to add a new business and stem losses from
declining newspaper circulation and increased printing costs.  Tribune, seeking to emerge from bankruptcy, is interviewing
bankers about selling its papers, two people with knowledge of
the matter said on Dec. 11.  Gary Weitman , a spokesman for Tribune, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
