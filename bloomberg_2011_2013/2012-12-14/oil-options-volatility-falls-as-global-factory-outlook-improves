Crude options volatility fell as
futures climbed after reports showing manufacturing gains in the
U.S. and  China  boosted optimism that fuel demand will rise.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 26.04 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:50 p.m., down from 26.82 percent
yesterday.  February-delivery crude oil advanced 81 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $86.25 a barrel on the Nymex.  Futures gained as U.S. industrial output rose in November
by the most in two years, according to Federal Reserve data.
China’s manufacturing is expanding at a faster pace in December,
according to a preliminary purchasing managers’ index released
today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $87 calls, which slipped 11 cents to 4 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,844 lots at 2:52 p.m. January $86 puts were the
second-most active, with 2,360 lots exchanged as they declined
59 cents to 1 cent. January options expired at the close of
floor trading today.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 56
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 52
percent of the 114,064 contracts traded.  February $105 calls were the most active options yesterday
with 6,877 contracts changing hands. They declined 1 cent to 9
cents a barrel. January $86 puts increased 13 cents to 60 cents
on 5,193 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
45,794 contracts. Next were January $60 puts at 34,922 lots, and
January $110 calls with 31,399.  To contact the reporter on this story:
