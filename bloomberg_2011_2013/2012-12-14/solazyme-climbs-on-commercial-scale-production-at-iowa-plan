Solazyme Inc. (SZYM) , which makes oils from
sugar-consuming algae, rose to its highest in more than a month
after it reached commercial-scale production at an  Archer-
Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)  plant in  Iowa .  The company climbed 5.5 percent to $8.60 at the close in
New York, the highest since Oct. 25. The shares have declined 27
percent this year.  Solazyme, based in South San Francisco, California,
produced the renewable oil in 500,000-liter (132,000-gallon)
vessels, according to a statement released after the market
closed yesterday. The oil is processed into fuel and specialty
chemicals.  “Solazyme’s fermentations have reached a scale that, to
our knowledge, is the highest level of any algae-based company
in the world,”  Pavel Molchanov , an analyst at Raymond James &
Associates Inc. in Houston, wrote in a note to investors today.
“This news is bullish not just for Solazyme but for the algae
arena as a whole,” he said.  Solazyme may begin producing 20,000 metric tons of oil
annually at the Clinton, Iowa, facility in early 2014, according
to the statement. Solazyme and ADM partnered in November to
produce specialty oils at the fermentation plant in Iowa.  ADM is the world’s largest corn processor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
