     Dec. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Ford Motor Co. is talking to the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about how it tests fuel
economy performance on new vehicles following reports that the
automaker’s hybrids are falling short of mileage promises.  “We will continue to talk on behalf of the industry with
the EPA to determine if changes are necessary,” Joe Hinrichs,
chief of Ford’s operations in North and South America, told
reporters in Detroit. The EPA “has made changes over the last
couple of decades as technology has changed.”  Ford’s two newest hybrid models fell 17 percent to 21
percent short of the company’s promise of 47 miles (76
kilometers) per gallon in tests by Consumer Reports. The Ford
Fusion hybrid achieved 39 mpg while the C-Max hybrid averaged 37
mpg in tests of city and highway driving, the Yonkers,  New York- 
based magazine said in a statement this month.  Ford isn’t asking the EPA to make any specific
modifications to its mileage testing procedures, Hinrichs said.  Sales of Ford’s hybrids haven’t been hurt by the
controversy surrounding the real world mileage reviewers are
getting in those models, Hinrichs said.  “We’re seeing great sales,” Hinrichs said. “We follow
the EPA test guidelines and we’re proud of the fuel economy and
technology in our vehicles.”  Ford sold 4,848 C-Max hybrids last month, a 52 percent gain
compared with October, its first full month of sales. The
company sold 1,834 Fusion hybrids in November, up from 993 a
year earlier, according to researcher Autodata Corp.  Ford fell 1.5 percent to $11.10 at the close in New York.  Ford’s Strategy  The C-Max and Fusion hybrids are among six new hybrids and
electric cars Ford is fielding this year and next in an effort
to advance in a market dominated by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  Chief
Executive Officer Alan Mulally has made fuel economy a
cornerstone of his turnaround plan.  Hybrids are highly sensitive to driving styles, which can
lower performance by as much as 17 miles per gallon, Raj Nair,
Ford’s product development chief, said at a presentation at Ford
Field, home of the National Football League’s Detroit Lions.  “We’ve designed our hybrids to drive exactly the same as
our other vehicles” by giving them more horsepower than
Toyota’s Prius line of hybrid vehicles, Nair said. “It makes
them more sensitive to spirited driving.”  Nair said his performance fell by 12 mpg when he drove
Ford’s C-Max hybrid the same as he drives his Mustang Shelby
Cobra sports car.  “We absolutely agree with the EPA that hybrids are far
more variable in test cycles” than traditional cars, Nair said.  NHTSA Investigation  Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said it has upgraded an investigation covering
some 2008-2010 Ford Fusions, Lincoln MKZs and Mercury Milans.
Unsecured mats may interfere with the accelerator pedal
returning to idle, the agency said.  “Drivers allege continued high engine power after
releasing the accelerator pedal and difficulty braking,” NHTSA
said in a statement on its website.  The investigation covers about 480,000 cars, NHTSA said in
a different statement today its website. No crashes or injuries
have been reported, though some drivers said they had to shift
into neutral or turn off the engine to slow down, according to
the agency. NHTSA began examining complaints in May 2010.  “We were disappointed by NHTSA’s upgrade of this
investigation, particularly since the condition under
investigation relates to improperly installed, unsecured or
double stacked floor mats, but we will continue to cooperate
fully with the agency through this process,” Susan Krusel, a
Ford spokeswoman, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
