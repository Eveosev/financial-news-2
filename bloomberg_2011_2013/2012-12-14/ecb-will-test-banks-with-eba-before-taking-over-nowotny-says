The  European Central Bank  and the
European Banking Authority will hold a joint financial  stress
test  next year before the central bank takes over supervision,
Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said.  “It is planned that there will be a coordinated stress
test before the European supervision starts,” Nowotny told
reporters in Vienna today. “It will be coordinated between the
ECB and the EBA, probably in the second half of next year.”  Bolstering confidence in the region’s financial industry is
a key component of government efforts to defeat the debt crisis
that has roiled markets since late 2009. Next year’s joint round
of stress tests will gauge banks’ progress toward meeting new
capital rules set by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
before the ECB is set to take over supervision in March 2014.  The decision to hold a joint assessment was made to avoid
subjecting lenders to separate tests, Nowotny said after a
presentation of the Austrian central bank’s semi-annual
financial-stability report. Details of the stress tests are
still being determined, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
