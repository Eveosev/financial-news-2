Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-
Claude Juncker said a decision on who will succeed him as
chairman of euro-area finance ministers meetings will have to be
taken by the end of January.  “I don’t expect a decision on this before the end of the
year, because it was agreed I would still chair the eurogroup
meeting in January, which will be mainly about Cyprus,” Juncker
told reporters in Brussels today after attending a meeting of EU
leaders. “A decision has to be taken by the end of January.”  Juncker, who was re-appointed to a new 30-month term as
eurogroup chairman in July, has since said he will step down  by
early 2013. Juncker has chaired euro-area finance meetings since
2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
