Fresenius SE said it’s in talks with
several parties to sell its unprofitable biotechnology unit as
the health-care company focuses on dialysis, infusions, and
hospital and facility management as its main businesses.  The unit’s top-selling drug, the immunosuppressant ATG-
Fresenius S, may be retained in the event of a disposal, the Bad
Homburg, Germany-based company said in a  statement  today.
Fresenius said it will decide in the first quarter how many of
its biotechnology assets to sell.  The biotechnology division, which also makes the Removab
antibody agent, posted a 15 percent increase in nine-month
revenue to 26 million euros ($34 million). The sale of the unit,
which is expected to post a 25 million-euro loss this year, will
boost earnings in 2013, Fresenius said.  “The key message first is that they’re going to stop those
losses from recurring,” Sebastian Frericks, an analyst at
Frankfurt-based Bankhaus Metzler, said by telephone.  ATG is the more profitable part of the Fresenius
biotechnology business, Metzler said. In use since 1981, the
drug is used by organ- and stem-cell transplant patients.  Fresenius  rose  as much as 2.3 percent to 90 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since Nov. 27, and was trading up 1.2
percent at 2:33 p.m. in  Frankfurt .  The medical-services company said in its 2011 annual report
that it was trying to boost sales of Removab. The treatment was
approved in 2009 to counter malignant ascites, the buildup of
cancer-cell-containing fluid in the abdomen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
