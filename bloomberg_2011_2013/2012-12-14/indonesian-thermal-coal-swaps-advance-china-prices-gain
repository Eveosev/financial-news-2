Swaps prices declined for thermal
coal from  Indonesia , the world’s largest exporter of the power-
station fuel, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for Indonesian sub-bituminous coal with a
calorific value of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram in the first
quarter of 2013 gained 45 cents to $62.75 a metric ton on a net-
as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
January contract advanced 50 cents to $62.50 a ton.  A swap for 5,000 tons a month of Indonesian coal sold
yesterday at $62.75 a ton for the first quarter, Ginga said.  Contracts for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipment to South  China  in the first
quarter climbed 30 cents to $83.90 a ton on a net-as-received
basis, the energy broker said. The swap for January held at
$83.50.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with better-quality stock.
Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100 per kilogram,
according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
