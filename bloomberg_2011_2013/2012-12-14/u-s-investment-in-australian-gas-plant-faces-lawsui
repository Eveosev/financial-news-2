The U.S. Export-Import Bank’s $3
billion in financing for a liquefied natural gas facility in
 Australia  faces a legal challenge from conservation groups
alleging the project threatens the Great Barrier Reef and marine
life.  The bank violated the U.S. Endangered Species Act and a
historic preservation law by financing the project without first
consulting with wildlife agencies or reviewing the project’s
impact on the environment, according to a complaint filed by the
Center for Biological Diversity and two other groups in federal
court in  San Francisco .  The Australia Pacific LNG Project is located in Queensland,
Australia, and will drill as much as 10,000 gas wells using
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, install 300 miles of pipeline
to transport the gas to the coast and construct a facility to
turn gas to liquid and ship it through the Great Barrier Reef,
according to the complaint.  The facility will be located in designated habitat for the
dugong, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles listed by the U.S.
as endangered, according to the complaint. The lawsuit seeks a
court order requiring the agency to suspend commitment of
resources until it consults with U.S. agencies.  Linda Formella, an Export-Import Bank spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday seeking comment about
the lawsuit.  The case is  Center for Biological Diversity  v. Export-
Import Bank, 12-6325, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
 California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
