PSI AG, a maker of software for
large-network management, rose the most in more than six months
after Chief Executive Officer Harald Schrimpf predicted a “very
strong” first quarter.  The shares advanced as much as 6.5 percent, the steepest
intraday increase since May 29 and were up 4.6 percent as of
2:50 p.m. in  Frankfurt , the biggest gainer on the  TECDAX index. 
The stock has added 7.7 percent this year, valuing the company
at 247.7 million euros ($324 million). Trading volume was more
than three times the three-month daily average.  PSI will post “good, but not dazzling” order intake in
the fourth quarter, Schrimpf said in an interview, adding that
sales in the period will exceed new orders. “We will take some
new orders into January,” he said. “We will certainly see
again a very strong first quarter.”  PSI is creating a joint software platform that improves the
company’s efficiency and reduces costs. This will help the
Berlin-based software provider meet its mid-term goal of
boosting annual sales by 8 percent on average and allow it to
raise its margin on earnings before interest and taxes as a
share of sales by 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage points
each year to 2015, Schrimpf said.  Order intake will rise to about 200 million euros in 2013,
compared with a target of 190 million euros this year, the CEO
said. He views analysts’ 2012 estimates with “great calm,”
Schrimpf said.  “2012 targets are confirmed which shows that the numbers
might come in a bit better in the end,” Klaus Schlote, a
Solventis analyst who rates the stock buy, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
