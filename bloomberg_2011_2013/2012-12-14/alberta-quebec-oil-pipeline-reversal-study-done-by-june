Alberta and Quebec’s study on the
effects of  Enbridge (ENB)  Inc.’s plan to boost the flow of oil from
Western to Eastern Canada should conclude by about June, Quebec
Premier Pauline Marois said.  A working group of provincial officials studying the
environmental and economic implications of the proposed pipeline
flow reversal should be done by “the end of spring,” Marois
said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York
yesterday.  “We want to see the advantages and the drawbacks, and
after that we will take the decision,” she said. “Some people
say the pipeline can’t receive oil from the  tar sands  because
it’s too heavy.”  Enbridge, based in Calgary, has proposed reversing Line 9B
and using it to help ship crude from Alberta’s oil sands to
Montreal.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , owner of
the only two refineries in Quebec, may benefit from the reversal
and more access to cheaper Canadian crude instead of using oil
shipped from overseas.  The population of Quebec may be more inclined to support
the proposal if Enbridge and other companies are willing to make
investments in renewable energy in the province, she said.  Enbridge has invested more than C$350 million ($355
million) in green energy in Quebec with its 50 percent interest
in the Lac Alfred wind farm, spokesman  Graham White  said in an
email.  To contact the reporters on this story:
