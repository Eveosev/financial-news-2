Valerie Jarrett , a senior adviser to
President  Barack Obama , pressed the case to leading
manufacturing executives for a budget deal including increases
on tax rates paid by high earners.  Jarrett met today in Washington with the executive
committee of the National Association of Manufacturers as part
of a White House effort to seek support from business leaders in
talks with Republican congressional leaders to avert automatic
cuts in government spending and tax increases for the middle
class that are scheduled to begin in January.  Jarrett said it was “a great opportunity for me to speak
directly to an important segment of our economy” and “answer
their specific questions on the fiscal cliff.”  Mary Andringa, president and chief executive officer of
Vermeer Corp., the association’s chairwoman, and  Doug Oberhelman , chairman and CEO of Caterpillar Inc. and the
association’s vice chairman, were among the executives at the
meeting at the group’s office.  Obama and his senior advisers have had a series of meetings
with major corporate CEOS and other business leaders as they
call for allowing  tax  cuts for top earners to expire at the end
of the year. Republicans want to continue the lower tax rates
for couples with more than $250,000 in annual income.  Obama and House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican,
met for 50 minutes today at the White House as negotiations
continued on the budget stalemate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
