The ruble dropped for a second day
as investors speculated gains were overdone.  The ruble slid 0.2 percent against the dollar to 30.7250 by
the close in Moscow, paring its weekly advance to 0.5 percent.
It lost 0.2 percent versus the central bank’s target euro-dollar
basket to 34.9978 and declined 0.3 percent versus the euro to
40.22.  The ruble has climbed 3.4 percent since reaching a two-
month low on Nov. 13. Russian markets are closed for New Year
and Christmas holidays in the first week of January.  Investors “cut their speculative long ruble positions,”
Anton Nikitin, an analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow said by e-
mail. “People prefer to be light before the holidays.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.1755 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose one basis point to 178,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
