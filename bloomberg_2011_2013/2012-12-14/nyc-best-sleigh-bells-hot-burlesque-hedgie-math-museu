What’s the probability of making a
free throw in basketball? Answering such questions is the
nation’s first museum devoted to mathematics, which opens its

cool math is, especially those ill-served by stupefying
textbooks.  There are more than 40 exhibits within the new 20,000-
square-foot space: Feedback Fractals use video cameras to create
intricate repeating patterns, while Wall of Fire invites
visitors to play with laser light.  Museum of Mathematics is at 11 E. 26th St. Information: +1-
