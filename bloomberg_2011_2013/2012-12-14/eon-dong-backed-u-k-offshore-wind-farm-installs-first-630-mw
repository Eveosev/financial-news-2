London Array, the largest offshore
wind farm approved, completed its first installment phase as
backers EON SE,  Dong Energy  A/S and Masdar Abu Dhabi Future
Energy Co. seek to curb technology costs by building at scale.  The 175th and final turbine of the first 630-megawatt phase
was installed yesterday, putting the project on track to be
fully operational next spring, the companies said in a
 statement . The developers plan to add 240 megawatts in a second
phase at the site off the Kent and Essex coasts.  “London Array will soon be the largest operational
offshore wind farm in the world,” said Benj Sykes, head of Dong
Energy’s U.K. wind business. “Building offshore wind farms of
this size and larger in the future allows us to harvest the
advantages of scale and is an important element of our strategy
to drive down the cost of energy.”  Britain targets a 10-fold expansion in offshore wind by the
end of this decade to limit fossil fuel use and create jobs. The
country has tripled the portion of energy coming from renewables
since 2009 and targets a 15 percent supply by 2020.  To contact the reporters on this story:
