Cattle futures rallied in Chicago,
touching a record in electronic trading, on speculation that
U.S. supplies will shrink. Hog prices slid.  Domestic beef  output  in the first three months of 2013 will
be 6.105 million pounds (2.77 million metric tons), down 6.5
percent from the fourth quarter and 2.8 percent lower than a
year earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  has projected.
Cattle futures are up 9.2 percent this year as the U.S. herd
shrank.  The supply of cattle tends to “tighten up going into the
winter,”  Ryan Turner , a risk-management consultant at FCStone
Group Inc., said in a telephone interview from  Kansas City ,
 Missouri . “We’re going to see tighter supplies going into
January, February and March.”  Cattle futures for February delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
settle at $1.326 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. After the close, prices reached $1.3295 in electronic
trading, the highest for the most-active contract. Cattle last
reached a record on Nov. 23.  Prices, up 10 percent since the end of June, also are
getting “really good technical support” after the February
contract topped $1.30, Turner said.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement slid less than
0.1 percent to $1.53075 a pound on the CME, halting a seven-
session rally.  Hog futures for February settlement slumped 0.6 percent to
close at 85.4 cents a pound in  Chicago . That was the first
decline in five sessions, narrowing this week’s advance to 2.3
percent. Futures still are up 1.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
