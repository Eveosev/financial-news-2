Russian equities rose as oil
rallied, boosting appetite for stocks in the world’s biggest
energy exporter. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , the nation’s biggest coking coal
producer, gained the most in three months after a report
signaled manufacturing may expand faster this month in China.  The Micex Index increased 0.2 percent to 1,466.15 by the
close in Moscow, with 18 stocks rising and 12 falling. The gauge
advanced 1.7 percent in the week. OAO Rosneft, the country’s
biggest oil company, added 2 percent, while United Co. Rusal,
the world’s largest aluminum producer, jumped 1.1 percent. The
benchmark measure rose four days out of five this week.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, increased 0.5 percent to
$86.29 a barrel in New York. Mechel surged as much as 4.3
percent after a preliminary purchasing managers’ index for  China 
showed a reading of 50.9, higher than a median estimate of 50.8
in a Bloomberg News survey. U.S. industrial production climbed
1.1 percent in November, the Federal Reserve reported today.  “We’ve seen positive manufacturing data out of China and
oil is trading at a comfortable level for Russian investors,”
Sergey Fundobny, head of research at Arbat Capital in Moscow,
said by phone. “Good global PMI data has boosted appetite for
riskier assets.”  Trading Volumes  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 18 percent
below the 30-day average, according to Bloomberg data.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of commodities rose 0.4
percent to 634.11. The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  climbed less than 0.1 percent
to 1,500.89.  “The main focus will be on flash PMI numbers across the
globe, with strong numbers from China,” Slava Smolyaninov, an
equity analyst at UralSib Financial Corp, wrote in an e-mailed
report today.  EON  Russia , a unit of  Germany ’s largest utility, gained 2.1
percent to 2.5527 rubles, the highest since Nov. 12. The stock
rose for the biggest weekly advance on the index at 7.4 percent.

Interfax reported on Dec. 12, citing Ulf Backmeyer, deputy
general director of finance, economics in Russia. Alfa Bank
cited the company as its top sector pick on “healthy” dividend
expectations, according to yesterday’s note.  Shares of AFK Sistema fell 0.6 percent to 24.779 rubles,
posting a 1 percent drop in the week, the biggest on the index.

which cited EPFR Global data.  Mechel jumped 4.1 percent to 204.50 rubles, the biggest

the largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 0.9
percent to $29.09, retreating for the first time in 12 days
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the stock futures, rose 4.3 percent to 23.61 points.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings 
after adding 4.6 percent this year. That compares with a
multiple of 10.6 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
which has gained 13.7 percent.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
