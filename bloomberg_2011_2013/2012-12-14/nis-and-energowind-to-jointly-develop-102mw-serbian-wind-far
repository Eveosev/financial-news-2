Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company controlled by  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) ,
bought a 50 percent stake in a Serbian wind farm project from
 Energowind , a renewable energy developer.  Construction of the 160 million-euro ($209 million), 102-
megawatt wind farm in Plandiste, 70 kilometers (44 miles)
northeast of Belgrade is to begin in the summer of 2013 and take
three quarters to complete, said Kirill Kravchenko, chief
executive officer of the Novi Sad-based company, at the signing
of the agreement with Energowind in Belgrade today.  NIS is paying 9 million euros for the stake and may invest
another 14.5 million euros of its own cash in the project. The
remaining financing will be agreed on with banks by the end of
March, Kravchenko said. Output from the 34 planned turbines is
seen at 212 gigawatt hours a year, starting in early 2014.  Investing in renewables is part of NIS’s strategy to branch
out into electricity production and it may also cut cost for
expected buying of carbon credits for the company’s main
operations, oil fields and refineries, Kravchenko said.  Akuo Energy SAS, a French energy developer focused on
renewable sources, may join the project next year, Kravchenko
said. The equipment supplier and contractor for the  Plandiste
wind farm  will be chosen in early 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
