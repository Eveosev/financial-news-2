Spot gasoline on the  Gulf Coast 
weakened to the lowest discount in at least six years amid
abundant supplies in the region.  Gasoline stocks on the Gulf Coast, known as PADD 3,
increased by 1.1 million barrels last week, the Energy
Department reported Dec. 12, bringing inventories in the region
to the highest level since February 2011.  Reformulated gasoline  on the Gulf Coast declined 1.25 cents
to a discount of 30 cents a gallon to futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:41 p.m., the lowest level since at
least May 2006.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  declined 2.5 cents to a discount of
6.25 cents to Nymex heating oil futures, the lowest level since
Nov. 12.  Conventional gasoline  dropped 1.25 cents to a discount of
33 cents to Nymex futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
