Steel reinforcement-bar futures
advanced to the highest level in almost five months after data
showed  China ’s manufacturing may expand at a faster pace and on
speculation the government will announce investment plans.  Rebar for May delivery rose 2.8 percent to 3,786 yuan
($607) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, the
highest price at close since July 19. Futures climbed 3.6
percent this week, paring losses to 10 percent this year.  The December preliminary reading was 50.9 for a purchasing
managers’ index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics. That compares with the 50.8 median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 12 economists. China’s central economic work
conference this weekend may highlight urbanization, China
Business News reported Dec. 12.  “Investors are betting the conference will set out plans
for urbanization investment, an important driver of steel
demand,” said Yu Yang, a Shanghai-based analyst with Shenyin
Wanguo Futures Co. “Once such plans are announced, it may
trigger a round of steel stockpiling, pushing prices higher.”  The  average spot price  of rebar in China was little changed
at 3,582  yuan  a ton today, according to the Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Spot iron ore  added 1.1 percent to
$126.4 a dry ton yesterday at Tianjin port, according to a gauge
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
