The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for October released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales declined 1.4% in October to $48.8
billion, reflecting drops in the aerospace product and parts,
the motor vehicle assembly, and the primary metal industries.
These declines were partly offset by higher sales in the
petroleum and coal product as well as the wood product
industries.  Sales declined in 12 of 21 industries, representing
approximately 71% of the manufacturing sector. Sales of durable
goods decreased 2.9% to $24.7 billion while sales of non-durable
goods rose 0.3% to $24.2 billion.  Constant dollar manufacturing sales fell 2.4% in October,
indicating a decline in the volume of manufactured goods sold.  Production drops in the aerospace product and parts industry  Production in the aerospace product and parts industry
dropped 25.4% to $1.3 billion, following a 37.1% increase in
September. The  aerospace industry  is one of the more volatile
industries in the manufacturing sector.  Sales in the motor vehicle assembly industry declined 3.7%
to $4.4 billion, following a 3.6% decrease in September. Sales
in the industry had reached a recent peak of $4.7 billion in
August, the highest level since November 2007.  In the primary metal industry, sales were down 2.8% to $3.7
billion. The decrease largely reflected a lower volume of
products sold.  Advances in the petroleum and coal product industry as well
as the wood product industry offset a portion of the declines.
In the petroleum and coal product industry, sales rose 2.0% to
$7.4 billion. The gain stemmed entirely from higher sales
volumes. In the wood product industry, sales increased 6.5% to
$1.8 billion. Most manufacturers in the industry reported higher
sales.  Sales down in six provinces  Sales were down in six provinces, though the decrease was
concentrated in Ontario.  In Ontario, sales dropped 3.4% to $22.0 billion, reflecting
lower sales in 17 of 21 industries. Just under half of the
provincial decline stemmed from lower sales of transportation
equipment. In the aerospace product and parts industry,
production fell 45.9% to $212 million. Sales in the motor
vehicle industry were down 3.5% to $4.3 billion. Lower sales in
the primary metal (-8.7%) and petroleum and coal product (-6.3%)
industries also contributed to the provincial decrease.  Manufacturing sales in  Alberta  declined 1.4% in October to
$6.3 billion. A 7.2% drop in the  food industry  and a 3.7%
decrease in petroleum and coal product sales were largely
responsible for the provincial decline. A 5.7% rise in the
machinery industry partly offset the decreases.  Sales rose 27.4% in Newfoundland and Labrador and 1.8% in
British Columbia. A 30.1% rise in non-durable goods sales was
responsible for the gain in Newfoundland and Labrador. In
British Columbia, the sales increase reflected a 7.7% advance in
the wood product industry.  Inventories advance  Inventories advanced 1.3% in October to $66.2 billion, the
highest level since January 2009. Increases in the inventories
of petroleum and coal products as well as aerospace product and
parts were behind the gains.  In the petroleum and coal products industry, inventories
rose 13.2% to $5.4 billion. The increase reflected a 12.8% gain
in finished product inventories and a 26.4% rise in raw
materials held by manufacturers.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, inventories
were up 5.1% to $4.8 billion in October. The increase mostly
stemmed from a gain in goods-in-process inventories.  The inventory-to-sales ratio advanced to 1.36 in October
from 1.32 in September. The level in October was the highest
since June 2011. The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of
the time, in months, that would be required to exhaust
inventories if sales were to remain at their current level.  Total unfilled orders are flat  In October, total unfilled orders were unchanged at $61.9
billion from September. Gains in the aerospace product and parts
industry and the electrical equipment, appliance and component
industry were largely offset by declines in the fabricated metal
product and machinery industries.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, unfilled
orders increased 1.2% in October to $31.8 billion. Unfilled
orders also advanced in the electrical equipment, appliance and
component industry (+7.1%). This advance stemmed from higher
unfilled orders reported by most manufacturers.  In the fabricated metal product industry, unfilled orders
declined 2.8% to $6.3 billion. Unfilled orders decreased 1.9% in
the machinery industry to $7.6 billion. In both industries, the
decrease in unfilled orders was widespread.  New orders in October declined 0.6% to $48.8 billion,
reflecting decreases in the fabricated metal product, computer
and electronic product, and primary metal industries. Gains in
the aerospace product and parts as well as the wood product
industries offset a portion of the declines.  Note to readers  Preliminary data are provided for the current reference
month. Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for
the three previous months.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted and are
expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified. For

tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
