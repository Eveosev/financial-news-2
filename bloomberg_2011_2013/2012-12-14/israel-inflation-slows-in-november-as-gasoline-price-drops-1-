Israel ’s  inflation  rate declined for
a second month in November as growth eased and the price of
gasoline declined.  Inflation slowed to 1.4 percent, the lowest since July, the
Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics reported today. The
median estimate of 12 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was 1.8
percent, with none lower than 1.7 percent. In the month,
consumer prices fell 0.5 percent.  “We are seeing a weakening in consumer sentiment,”
Aholiav Levy, an analyst at Ramat Gan, Israel-based Excellence
Nessuah Investment House Ltd., said prior to the announcement.
“In every retail sector in which there is real competition, we
see prices moderating.”  The Bank of Israel monetary policy committee, led by
Governor Stanley Fischer, has gradually reduced the borrowing
rate from 3.25 percent in 2011 in an effort to shore up the
economy amid the  European debt crisis . The committee left the
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent at the end of
November.  Gasoline and car oil prices dropped 4.3 percent in
November, the bureau said. Fresh vegetable prices declined 12.8
percent, while telephone and Internet service costs fell 1.7
percent.  Israeli  growth  is expected to slow to 3.3 percent this year
from 4.6 percent in 2011, according to central bank estimates.
About 40 percent of Israel’s gross domestic product is made up
of exports, with Europe one of the largest markets.  Economists’ 12-month  inflation expectations  fell to 1.9
percent on average from 2.2 percent the previous month, the
central bank said on Nov. 19.The government’s target is 1
percent to 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
