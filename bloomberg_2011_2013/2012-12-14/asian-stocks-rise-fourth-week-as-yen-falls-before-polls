Asian  stocks  rose for a 12th day,
leading the regional benchmark gauge to a fourth weekly gain, as
Japan’s exporters advanced on a weaker yen before elections
tomorrow expected to hand power to an opposition party pushing
for more central bank easing.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 1.8 percent. Guoco Group Ltd.
jumped 31 percent in  Hong Kong  after the developer received a
HK$8.25 billion ($1 billion) buyout offer. CLP Holdings Ltd.,

selling shares at a discount.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 1 percent to 127.44
this week, with the gauge capping its longest streak of daily
gains since January 2004. Japanese shares lifted the benchmark
on bets Shinzo Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party  will win this
weekend.  “Investors have a high expectation that if Abe wins the
elections, they’ll do more aggressive monetary easing and people
expect the yen to weaken,” said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based
global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd.,
which oversees about $1.3 trillion. “The overall environment is
quite supportive for Asian equities.”  Asia’s benchmark equities index rose almost 17 percent from
this year’s low on June 4 as central banks from the U.S.,  Europe ,
Japan and China took action to spur economic growth. The gauge

Dec. 3. China’s  industrial  production climbed 10.1 percent in
November while retail sales growth accelerated to 14.9 percent,
the statistics bureau said Dec. 9.  Japanese exporters advanced as the yen fell to a nine-month
low on speculation the opposition will return to power.Abe,
leader of the LDP and front-runner to be the nation’s next prime
minister, has called for unlimited easing and a doubling of the
central bank’s inflation goal.  Exporters Gain  Toyota advanced 1.8 percent to 3,600 yen in Tokyo.  Sony

yen.  Companies that do business in the U.S. advanced after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will expand its asset purchase program
by buying $45 billion a month of Treasury bonds to further spur
the economy. The central bank for the first time linked the
outlook for its key rate to unemployment and inflation,
signaling near-zero rates until 2015. Meanwhile, policymakers
continued to spar over the U.S. budget. An agreement would help
avert the so-called fiscal cliff, which could result in more
than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts next year.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which depends on the Americas for
about 20 percent of its revenue, rose 2.4 percent to 1.515

from a group led by Malaysian billionaire Quek Leng Chan, its
biggest shareholder.  Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. (7012) , which gets 20 percent of
its sales from aerospace and defense, gained 6.3 percent to 204
