Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , the world’s eighth-
largest publicly-traded oil company this year, announced a 2013
production target of 798,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
lower than its original target for 2012.  The company plans to invest $9.5 billion next year to reach
its target of 1 million barrels of oil per day by 2015,
according to a regulatory filing today. Ecopetrol will invest
$6.59 billion, while its subsidiaries will invest $2.96 billion,
the company said.  “They’re being more conservative, the output target is a
small increase from this year’s, which I don’t think they’ll be
able to meet,” said Mauricio Restrepo, an analyst at Bolsa y
Renta in Medellin. “This year they’ve had delays in
exploration, and the company’s growth hasn’t been as high.”  Ecopetrol, which is 88.5 percent-owned by the Colombian
government, in October reported a 22 percent drop in profit in
the third quarter from a year earlier, as sales volume fell and
the cost of protecting its pipelines and fields rose. The
company cut its forecast in July to 780,000 barrels a day from
800,000 barrels a day for the year after guerrillas increased
attacks on oil infrastructure.  Output losses from attacks by guerrillas have since fallen
to fewer than 6,000 barrels a day, from 10,000 barrels a day
earlier this year, CEO Javier Gutierrez said Dec. 10. In  Havana 
last month, the government re-started peace talks with
guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia , or
FARC, to seek to end the 5-decade civil conflict.  Attacks on oil pipelines almost tripled to 142 in the first
ten months of the year, from 52 in the same period in 2011,
according to Defense Ministry statistics.  Ninety-five percent of next year’s investment will be in
Colombia, according to the statement.  Average production climbed 4.7 percent in the first nine
months of this year from the same period a year earlier to
750,100 barrels a day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
