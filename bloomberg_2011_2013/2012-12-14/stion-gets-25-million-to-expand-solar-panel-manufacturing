Stion Corp., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar panels, received about $25
million to expand production.  Khosla Ventures led the financing, which included “most
but not all” of the company’s existing investors, Frank Yang,
Stion’s senior director of business development, said today in a
phone interview.  “We may end up at the end of this round having all of them
participate,” Yang said.  Stion disclosed the investment in a filing Dec. 12 that
listed $55 million for the “total offering amount.” Its other
investors include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.,
LightSpeed Venture Partners, Braemar Energy Ventures and General
Catalyst Partners.  Stion will use the funding to expand production capacity to
about 140 megawatts a year from 100 megawatts a year at its
factory in Hattiesburg,  Mississippi , Yang said. The company,
based in  San Jose ,  California , said last year that a six-year
expansion project at the site may require as much as $500
million.  Avaco Co., the South Korean provider of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment, led a $130 million investment in Stion
last year and is helping the company improve its technology and
develop new processes for Asian and European markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
