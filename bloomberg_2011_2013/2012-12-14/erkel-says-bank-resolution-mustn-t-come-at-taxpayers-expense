German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
taxpayers won’t be forced to bear the costs of winding down
failed banks in  Europe .  European Union leaders agreed that resolution “may not be
at the cost of the taxpayers, but has to be structured so that
those responsible for the failures of the banks carry the
burden,” Merkel told reporters after the first session of a EU
summit in Brussels today.  The European Commission plans to propose the bank
resolution mechanism in 2013, EU leaders said in a statement
after the meeting.  The resolution mechanism “will be based on contributions
by the financial sector”  and will contain backstops that will
“be fiscally neutral over the medium term, by ensuring that
public assistance is recouped by means of ex-post levies on the
financial industry,”  the leaders said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
