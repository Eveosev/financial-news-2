Serbia’s fiscal gap reached 161.29
billion dinars ($1.85 billion) at the end of November,
equivalent to about 80 percent of the full-year deficit target.  The shortfall, calculated according to International
Monetary Fund standards, rose 13.4 billion dinars in November,
when both spending and revenue collection returned to
“normality” after some distortions in October, the month of
quarterly payment of sales tax and excise duties, the Belgrade-
based  Finance Ministry  said on its website today. The government
targets a full-year gap of 203.6 billion dinars.  Total November monthly spending dropped 18.8 percent to
77.9 billion dinars as the government lowered payments for
subsidies and commodity purchases, while revenue collection
declined by a third to 64.5 billion dinars.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet, in office since July,
plans to cut the deficit to 3.6 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013 from 6.7 percent this year and balance the
budget in 2016.  The government has yet to convince the IMF that it’s able
to adhere to the budgeted fiscal targets and is scheduled to
meet the lender next spring for a second round of talks on a new
loan program.  To contact the reporters on this story:
