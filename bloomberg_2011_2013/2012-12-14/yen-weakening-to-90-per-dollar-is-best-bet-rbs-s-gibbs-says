The yen may extend its slide to 90
per dollar by the first quarter of next year or sooner,
according to Greg Gibbs, a senior currency strategist at the
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  Gibbs, based in  Singapore , spoke today with  Susan Li  on
Bloomberg Television’s “First Up.”  On the Yen’s outlook:  “This is the biggest story in foreign exchange at the
moment. The yen’s in the process of a major sentiment turn
here.”  “How high can it go? Well I think we can really get to 90
before we really need to ask that question because the economic
conditions as they are now aren’t really a restraint on dollar-
yen going higher.”  “By Q1 next year is easily achievable, if not sooner.”  On currency strategy:  “The best bet is to sell yen. I like dollar-yen higher,
I’m not as bearish to the dollar as many are. I think the dollar
is basically getting close to the point to where it’s had its
biggest negative move on quantitative measures from the Fed.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
