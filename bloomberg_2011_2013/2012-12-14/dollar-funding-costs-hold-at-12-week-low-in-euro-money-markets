The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars held near the lowest in 12 weeks, according to
a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars was little
changed at 22 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate
at 8:25 a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure is the lowest since Sept. 21.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 25 basis
points below Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  A measure of European banks’ reluctance to make unsecured
loans to one another fell to a four-day low. The difference
between Euribor and overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-
OIS spread, was 12.6 basis points from 12.8 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.071
percent yesterday from a record-low 0.066 percent the day
before. The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight
borrowing costs over the next three months, was little changed
at 5.7 basis points.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to 204 billion euros ($267 billion) from
a year-low 195 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
