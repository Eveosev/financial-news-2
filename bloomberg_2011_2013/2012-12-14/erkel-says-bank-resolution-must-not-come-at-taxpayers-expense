German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
a potential European resolution mechanism to wind down failed
banks must not come at the expense of  Europe ’s taxpayers. A
“solidarity fund” to support cash-strapped governments will
serve primarily to boost competitiveness, Merkel also said after
a meeting of European Union leaders today in Brussels.  On bank supervision and resolution:  “We need two things besides the supervision mechanism:
once supervision is in place, which will be in March 2014, we
need on the one hand rules for the direct recapitalization of
banks that are supervised by the European supervisor.”  “Secondly, and that’s something  Mario Draghi  as president
of the  European Central Bank  made clear today, we also need a
legal framework to wind down banks that are under European
supervision, if needed. It says very clearly in the documents
that these resolution mechanisms mustn’t come at the expense of
taxpayers but must be designed in a way that those who are
responsible for adverse developments at banks carry the
burden.”  On a “solidarity fund”:  “We’ve decided to sort out by June the details of how we
can, on the one hand, sign contracts between the commission and
member states to improve competitiveness and, on the other hand,
possibly make financial resources available to support countries
that are completely busy consolidating their budgets. The
question of external shocks and such is not contained in the
documents.”  “We’ve restricted ourselves to support related to the
improvement of competitiveness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
