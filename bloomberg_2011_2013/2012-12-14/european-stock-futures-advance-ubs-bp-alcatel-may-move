European stocks  were little changed
as U.S. lawmakers continued talks for a new budget agreement.  Alcatel-Lucent SA surged 8.1 percent after saying it
reached a $2.1 billion financing deal with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG.  Fiat SpA (F) , which owns 58.5
percent in Chrysler Group LLC, fell 2.3 percent to 3.50 euros as
it plans a capital increase.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slipped 0.1 percent to 279.36 at
2:25 p.m. in  London . The measure has still rallied 19 percent
since this yearâ€™s low on June 4 as the  European Central Bank  and
the  Federal Reserve  expanded asset purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
