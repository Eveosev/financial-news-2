Vietnam ’s three-year bonds had the
worst week in two months on speculation banks will scale back
investments as they hoard cash to meet year-end requirements.
The dong was stable.  The State Treasury sold fewer securities and paid higher
yields at an auction yesterday than at a sale last week,
according to the Hanoi Stock Exchange website. It issued 1.45
trillion dong ($70 million) of two-year notes at 9.1 percent and
1.75 trillion dong of three-year debt at 9.3 percent. Investors
picked up 2 trillion dong each of similar-maturity bonds at 9
percent and 9.25 percent, respectively, on Dec. 6.  “Banks must hold cash to meet payment and withdrawal
demand near the end of the year, so they are less interested in
buying bonds,” said Nguyen Thi Thu Trang, senior analyst at
Hanoi-based BIDV Securities Joint-Stock Co.  The yield on the three-year notes rose 10 basis points, or
0.1 percentage point this week, to 9.41 percent in the biggest
increase since the five days ended Oct. 19, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The yield climbed six
basis points today.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 3:25 p.m. in
Hanoi today, compared with 20,843 at the end of last week and
20,850 yesterday, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam fixed its daily reference
 rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
