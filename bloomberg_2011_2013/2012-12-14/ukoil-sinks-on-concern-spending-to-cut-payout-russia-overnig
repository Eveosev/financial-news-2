OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  retreated from a 16-month
high in New York on concern new investments outside Russia will
limit increases in dividend payments from the nation’s second-
biggest crude producer.  American depositary receipts of Lukoil fell 2.2 percent to
$64.37 in New York yesterday, driving the first slump in eight
days for the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian stocks in the U.S. Futures expiring Dec. 17 on Moscow’s
RTS Index lost 0.3 percent to 149,270 as oil dropped on concern
over the U.S. budget.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , Russia’s
largest miner of the metal, slid the most in a month.  Lukoil, which trails state-backed oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) 
on market value, is considering buying Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 60
percent stake in the West Qurna-1 project in Iraq, First Vice
President Ravil Maganov said last week, according to the RIA
Novosti newswire. The company is also planning new wells in
 Africa , Andrei Kuzyaev, head of its overseas unit, said Dec. 5.
Dividends will be boosted by at least 15 percent a year, Deputy
Vice President Andrei Gaidamaka said Nov. 27.  “There is big deal of doubt over how much Lukoil will pay
in dividends after increasing spending,” Elena Savchik, an
analyst at Moscow-based Aton Capital LLC, who has a sell rating
on the stock, said by phone from Helsinki yesterday. “I’m
particularly concerned about their excessive spending on
expansion outside of  Russia .”  Interim Dividend  ADRs of Moscow-based Lukoil slipped the most since Nov. 7
in New York yesterday, to trade at a 0.9 percent discount to the
company’s shares listed on Russia’s Micex Index. The Moscow-
listed  stock  fell 1 percent to 1,995.50 rubles.  The producer’s board recommended an interim dividend of 40
rubles per share on Nov. 7 and said shareholders will vote on
the payment Dec. 18. Lukoil will pay a dividend of 42 rubles in
May, according to analysts’ estimates collected by Bloomberg,
after paying out 75 rubles in May of this year.  Lukoil will make a decision on possible participation in
the West Qurna-1 field by the end of the year, Chairman  Vagit Alekperov  said Nov. 28. The company already holds 75 percent of
the separate phase 2 project at the field. Lukoil plans to spend
$600 million on west African exploration next year, compared
with an earlier plan of $300 million, Kuzyaev said on Dec. 5.
The company failed to find commercial reserves after drilling
several wells off  Ghana  and the  Ivory Coast .  The  Bloomberg Russia-US gauge  declined 0.6 percent to 97.07
in New York yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the
largest dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, fell 0.9 percent
to $29.09, retreating for the first time in 12 days. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the  stock
futures , rose 4.3 percent to 23.61 points.  ‘Environment of Uncertainty’  “Russia is an oil and commodity driven market,” Matt Krueger, a portfolio analyst at Global Finance Private Capital
in Sarasota, Florida, who helps manage $500 million in emerging-
market assets, said by phone yesterday. “We are in a global
environment of uncertainty over U.S. budget talks and the
 European debt crisis .”  Crude for January delivery retreated 1 percent to $85.89 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Prices are
down 13 percent this year. Brent for January settlement on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange dropped 1.5 percent to
$107.91 a barrel.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export oil blend,
declined 0.9 percent to $106.24.  Ruble futures showed the currency weakening 0.2 percent to
30.752 per dollar yesterday.  London-based Polyus Gold lost 2.1 percent to $3.28 in New
York, the biggest daily drop since Nov. 14. In  London , the
shares slipped 1.1 percent to 208.75 pence, or $3.36. Gold
prices sank 0.9 percent yesterday.  RusHydro, MTS  Yandex NV (YNDX) , owner of Russia’s most-used search engine, rose
2.8 percent to $21.95 in New York, the biggest gainer on the
Russia-US measure in trading 36 percent above the daily average
over the past three months. The Moscow-based company is among
Credit Suisse Group AG’s top stock choices for 2013, the bank
said in an e-mailed report yesterday.  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  retreated 1.7 percent to $2.36 in New York,
after the  stock  declined 0.8 percent to 75.22 kopecks, or 2.44
U.S. cents, in Moscow. Russia’s biggest renewable energy
producer will start issuing an additional 110 billion shares at
1 ruble each on Dec. 19 and expects to complete the offering
within 30 days, Moscow-based RusHydro said in a regulatory
filing yesterday.  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , the nation’s chief mobile operator,
advanced 1.2 percent to $18.44 in U.S. trading, closing at the
highest level since Sept. 17. The company’s Moscow-listed  stock 
added 0.3 percent to 239.47 rubles.  The company known as MTS “has the strongest business
profile,” among its competitors, Moody’s Investors Service
wrote in a report issued yesterday. The ratings company
“expects MTS to retain its lead in terms of subscribers and
revenues for now,” it said.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
sank 0.4 percent to HK$4.79 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:40
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained less than
