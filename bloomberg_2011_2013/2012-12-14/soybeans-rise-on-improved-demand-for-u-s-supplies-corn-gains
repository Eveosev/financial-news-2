Soybeans rose the most in a week on
signs of increasing demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer. Corn gained on speculation that the
lowest prices in almost four weeks will spur demand.  U.S. processors  used  157.3 million bushels of soybeans in
November to make feed and cooking oil, up 11 percent from a year
ago, the National Oilseed Processors Association said today in a
report. Exports of soy-based animal feed jumped 54 percent in
November, the highest ever for the month. U.S. soybean  exports 
in the week ended Dec. 6 rose 15 percent from a week earlier and
were the most since November 2010, the government said
yesterday.  “Demand for soybeans is far surpassing anyone’s
expectations,” Rich Nelson, the chief strategist for Allendale
Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois , said in a telephone interview. “The
November crush was fantastic and overseas demand continues very
strong.”  Soybean futures for March delivery increased 1.3 percent to
close at $14.915 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest advance since Dec. 5. The most-active
contract gained for a fourth straight week and is up 23 percent
this year.  Corn futures for March delivery climbed 1.5 percent to
$7.3075 a bushel in Chicago, snapping a six-session decline.
Yesterday, the price touched $7.15, the lowest since Nov. 16.
The grain fell 0.9 percent this week and is down 14 percent
since reaching a record $8.49 in August.  Prices rose on speculation that overseas demand will
improve for U.S. supplies, Nelson said. Export sales for
delivery in the marketing year that ends August 31 fell 46
percent to 12.488 million metric tons on Dec. 6 from a year
earlier, USDA  data  show.  Domestic Reserves  Domestic reserves before the 2013 harvest will fall 35
percent to 16.424 million tons, the lowest since 1996, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said Dec. 11. Global corn  stockpiles 
will fall to 13.6 percent of what will be used for food, ethanol
and livestock feed, the lowest ratio since 1974, the USDA said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
