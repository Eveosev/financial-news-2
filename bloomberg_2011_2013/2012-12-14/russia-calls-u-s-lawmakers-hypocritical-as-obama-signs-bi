Russia  criticized U.S. trade
legislation targeting human-rights violations as President
 Barack Obama  signed the bill into law.  “Senators and congressmen, having followed the orders of
their business circles, shamelessly covered up their lawmaking
with a hypocritical ‘concern’ for human rights,” Russia’s
Foreign Ministry said in a  statement .  The legislation, approved by the Senate on Dec. 6, repeals
Cold War-era trade restrictions with Russia, while allowing the
U.S. to impose financial and travel restrictions on officials
implicated in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow
jail and others guilty of rights violations including torture
and murder. The law was passed by the  U.S. Senate  on Dec. 6.  Russia has imposed a restriction on imports of U.S. pork
and beef, requiring the meat be tested and certified as free of
ractopamine, a feed additive used to add lean muscle in
livestock, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.  “We continue to call on Russia to investigate, prosecute
and punish those responsible for the crimes committed against
Mr. Magnitsky,” Patrick Ventrell, a U.S. State Department
spokesman said today at a press briefing in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
