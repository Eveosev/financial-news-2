Manchester United captain Nemanja
Vidic will return to the squad for tomorrow’s Premier League
match against Sunderland, manager  Alex Ferguson  said.  Vidic has been out since September following knee surgery.
Ferguson said he wasn’t sure if the defender will start the game
at Old Trafford.  “It’s a big, big win to have him back in the squad,” the
manager said in comments on United’s website. “We’ll give him a
chance and we hape he sails through it.”  Defender Jonny Evans will miss the match with a hamstring
injury, Ferguson said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
