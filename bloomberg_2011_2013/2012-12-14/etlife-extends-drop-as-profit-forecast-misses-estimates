MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, fell for a second straight day in  New York  trading
after forecasting that 2013 operating profit may fall short of
analysts’ estimates.  MetLife  slid  3 percent to $31.84 at 4:10 p.m., the biggest
retreat among the 22 companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Insurance Index. The New York-based firm has gained 2.1 percent
this year.  The insurer said yesterday that profit excluding some
investment results may be $4.95 to $5.35 a share next year as
low interest rates weigh on returns in its bond portfolio. The
average  estimate  among 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
$5.48 a share before the announcement. The forecast doesn’t
include buybacks because MetLife can’t be sure that regulators
will allow them.  “Our outlook for MetLife reflects our outlook for no share
buybacks in 2013, as well as continued pressure from low
interest rates, and a significant presence in variable annuities
with tail-risk,”  Jay Gelb , an analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in
a research note yesterday. He rates the shares neutral.  Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian  said yesterday
that the insurer can reach 12 percent return on equity by 2016,
even if bond yields remain at current levels, near record lows.
He’s turning to growth outside the U.S. and expense cuts to
boost profit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
