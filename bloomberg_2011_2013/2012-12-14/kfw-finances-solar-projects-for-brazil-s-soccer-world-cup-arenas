KfW Group, Germany’s state-owned
development bank, provided financing for two solar-power
projects to be built on the roofs of soccer stadiums hosting the
World Cup in  Brazil .  KfW signed a contract with Brazilian utility  Cia Energetica
de Minas Gerais (CMIG4)  for a 10 million-euro ($13 million) loan, the
bank said today in a  statement . The solar projects, with a total
capacity of 2.6 megawatts, will be installed on the Mineirao and
Mineirinho stadiums in Belo Horizonte, it said. CEMIG provided
