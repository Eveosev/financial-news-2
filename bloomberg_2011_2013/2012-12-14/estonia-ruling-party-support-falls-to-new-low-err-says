Support for  Estonia ’s ruling Reform
Party fell in December while the Social Democrats had the most
support,  public broadcaster ERR  reported, citing a poll it
commissioned.  Prime Minister Andrus Ansip’s party had 22 percent backing,
down from 26 percent the previous month, which was the lowest
since 2009, according to the Nov. 21-Dec. 12 survey of 877
respondents by TNS Emor. It wasn’t immediately clear when the
Reform Party last had lower support.  The Social Democrats were backed by 28 percent, the Center
Party had 24 percent and junior coalition partner Isamaa ja Res
Publica Liit was favored by 18 percent of those polled, the most
this year. No margin of error was given.  Justice Minister Kristen Michal of Reform resigned last
week after a party-financing scandal. An investigation by state
prosecutors into party financing, which targeted suspects
including Michal, was closed Oct. 15 due to lack of evidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
