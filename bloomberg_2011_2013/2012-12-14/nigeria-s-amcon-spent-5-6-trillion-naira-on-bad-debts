The Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria , set up by the West African nation to buy bad debts from
banks, said it spent 5.6 trillion naira ($35.5 billion) in last
year to acquire non-performing loans.  Amcon, as the company is known, bought loans worth 4
trillion naira “with the acquisition costs at more than twice
the initial estimates” accounting for the remaining
expenditure, Chief Executive OfficerMustafa Chike-Obi told
reporters today in Lagos, the commercial capital. It made a net
loss of 2.43 trillion naira, while total assets amounted to 3.34
trillion naira, he said.  Africa ’s top oil producer established Amcon in 2010 as part
of measures to save its banking industry from collapse as
lenders reeled from bad loans to stocks speculators and fuel
importers following the global financial crisis in 2008. The
 Central Bank  of Nigeria fired the chief executive officers of
eight lenders and bailed them out with 620 billion naira.  Amcon sold bonds to fund the purchase of bad debt and took
over three of the rescued banks after regulators deemed them
unlikely to meet a recapitalization deadline. Lenders are
required to contribute part of their earnings to a fund toward
paying for the bonds.  “The key priorities to Amcon now are the liquidation of
holding in the nationalized banks and the recovery and
restructuring of acquired banks’ assets,” Chike-Obi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
