Romania plans to sell a majority
stake in state-owned postal monopoly  Posta Romana SA  and boost
its capital,  Mediafax  reported today, citing a draft law by the
Communications Ministry.  The government seeks to change its previous plan of selling
a minority stake in the Bucharest-based company, according to
the newswire. The buyer will probably buy new shares and become
a strategic investor, Mediafax said.  Fondul Proprietatea SA (FP) , a minority shareholder in the
company, has an option to buy new shares to keep its stake
unchanged, according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
