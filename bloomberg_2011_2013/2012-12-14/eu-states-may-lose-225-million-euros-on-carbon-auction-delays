European Union member states may
lose a total of 225 million euros ($295 million) in revenue for
national budgets should the bloc adopt a proposal to delay sales
of carbon permits, according to a Polish government study.  The draft measure to postpone auctions of 900 million
allowances, known as backloading, will cut income from sales in
Cyprus,  Poland , Estonia,  Czech Republic ,  Bulgaria  and  Romania  by
about 1.9 billion euros in 2013 to 2020, according to the study
e-mailed today by the Polish Environment Ministry.
Revenue for the other EU 19 countries will increase by about 1.7
billion euros. Revenue for Hungary and Lithuania will be little
changed.  The six central and eastern European countries will be the
worst off due to the proposal because they are seeking
exemption, also referred to as a derogation, from a requirement
that power plants purchase all allowances from 2013, according
to the report, which will be presented at a Dec. 17 ministerial
meeting in Brussels.  “The quota of allowances to be auctioned in the beginning
of the third period at the anticipated high prices will be
reduced twice: because of the backloading mechanism and because
of derogation,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
