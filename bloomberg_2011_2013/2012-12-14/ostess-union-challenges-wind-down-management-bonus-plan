A Hostess Brands Inc. union and a
pension fund said they are appealing the court order that gave
the bankrupt Twinkie maker permission to wind down.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain, at a Nov. 29 hearing in
White Plains, New York, approved Hostess’s requests to shut down
and to pay as much as $1.83 million in incentives to 19 senior
managers, while overruling objections to the bonuses.  The creditors are appealing the wind-down order entered in
the case on Nov. 30, according to court papers filed today by
the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers
International Union and the Bakery and Confectionery Union and
Industry International Pension Fund.  Hostess, based in Irving,  Texas , won final approval from
Drain to sell its assets and eliminate about 18,000 jobs. The
liquidation has drawn about two dozen bidders, including Wal-
Mart Stores Inc. and  Kroger Co. (KR) , according to a person familiar
with the matter.  Tom Becker, a Hostess spokesman, declined to comment on the
on the appeal notice.  Hostess, the 82-year-old maker of Ding Dongs, Ho Hos and
Drake’s Devil Dogs, said it was pushed into liquidation when the
bakers’ union went on strike Nov. 9 after Drain imposed contract
concessions opposed by 92 percent of the union’s members.  The company sought court protection in January, its second
time in bankruptcy, listing assets of $982 million and debt of
$1.43 billion.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
