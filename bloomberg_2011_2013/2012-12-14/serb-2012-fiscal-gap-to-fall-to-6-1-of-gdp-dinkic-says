Serbia’s full-year fiscal gap will
be narrower than the official target as the government holds
back on spending this month, Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic .  Serbia’s 2012 fiscal deficit will amount to 6.1 percent of
gross domestic product, compared with a targeted 6.7 percent of
GDP, or 203.6 billion dinars ($2.35 billion), Dinkic told
reporters today in Belgrade. The December shortfall may be below
40 billion dinars after a 161.3 billion-dinar gap in November.  “This shows that our forecasts for 2013 revenue and
spending are realistic,” he said.  Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s Cabinet is trying to persuade
the  International Monetary Fund  that the 2013 budget is feasible
and the government is able to adhere to the budgeted fiscal
targets before meeting the lender next spring for a second round
of talks on a new loan program.  The government plans to spend about $12.5 billion and
collect revenue worth $11 billion next year, cut state aid to
unprofitable public companies.  It also promising to forgive default interest on debts owed
by corporate tax payers and enforce a new property reporting
plan aimed at collecting a 20 percent tax from anyone whose
holdings exceed their reported income, Dinkic said.  To avoid financing state enterprises,  Serbia  will invite
bidders next month to buy drugmaker Galenika AD, after the
company accumulated 170 million euros in losses and will need 50
million euros above sales revenue next year to survive.  The government also hopes to sell sole steelworks, Zelezara
Smederevo, to NPO Uralvagonzavod OAO as “talks are going in the
right direction” and “we believe a contract could be signed in
the first quarter” of 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
