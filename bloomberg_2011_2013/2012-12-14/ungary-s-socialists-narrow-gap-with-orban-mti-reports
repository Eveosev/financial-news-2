Hungary’s Socialists, the biggest
opposition party, narrowed the gap with Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s ruling party this year as the radical Jobbik lost
support, state news service MTI said, citing an  Ipsos  poll.  Orban’s Fidesz had 19 percent backing among eligible
voters, compared with 16 percent for the Socialists, MTI said,
citing a Dec. 4-11 survey of 1,500 adults. In January, Fidesz
led the Socialists 16 percent to 11 percent, MTI said.  Former Premier  Gordon Bajnai ’s opposition alliance, Egyutt
2014, formed two months ago, was tied for third place with
Jobbik with 6 percent backing, Ipsos said, according to MTI,
which gave no margin of error.  Support for Jobbik fell to the lowest since January 2011
after one of its lawmakers called for the compilation of a list
of Jewish government members and lawmakers to assess whether
they pose a national security threat. The move last month was
condemned by all other political parties.  The poll was conducted before student protests erupted this
week across  Hungary  against government plans to introduce
tuition fees and cut state-subsidized places at universities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
