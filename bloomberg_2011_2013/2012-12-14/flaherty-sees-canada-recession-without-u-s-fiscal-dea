Canadian Finance Minister  Jim
Flaherty  said  Canada  would enter a recession if U.S. policy
makers are unable to reach an agreement to avoid fiscal
tightening scheduled for January.  Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Flaherty said he spoke
today to Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  about the issue,
adding he is concerned about the impact on Canada at a time when
the country is already experiencing “modest” growth. He did
not give details about their conversation.  “There is good reason for concern in the next quarter or
so if that issue is not resolved satisfactorily,” Flaherty told
reporters today in Ottawa.  Flaherty, who said he’s seen signs of softening in the
country’s  economic growth , told reporters there could be some
“bumpy” times ahead for the economy as the U.S. negotiations
continue. Flaherty is meeting on Dec. 16 and Dec. 17 with
provincial finance ministers to discuss the Canadian economy and
other issues.  One of the issues on the agenda is an expansion of the
country’s pension plan, said Flaherty, adding he opposes any
efforts now to raise premiums for workers because of the weak
economy.  Asked about rating downgrades of Canadian lenders yesterday
by  Standard & Poor’s , Flaherty said the decision reflected
concerns about the country’s housing market and which is why the
government has moved to tighten up lending growth.  “As you know, we’ve seen some softening in the market,”
Flaherty said. “I think that’s desirable. We want to avoid a
hard landing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
