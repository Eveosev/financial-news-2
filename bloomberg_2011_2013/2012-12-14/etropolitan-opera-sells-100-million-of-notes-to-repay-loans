New York  City’s Metropolitan Opera
Association, which faces growing operating losses, sold $100
million of debt this week in its first such offer since it was
founded more than a century ago.  The bonds were rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, its
seventh-highest grade. The 12-part sale included 30-year
securities that were priced at par and pay a 4.52 percent
coupon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s higher than the
4.16 percent yield investors receive from debt with a similar
credit grade and maturity, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  Founded in 1883, the group will use proceeds to pay down
two Bank of America Corp. loans totaling about $63.2 million and
end an interest-rate swap agreement with the bank, according to
bond documents. Terminating the swap cost $2.6 million as of
July 31, according to the offering statement.  The Met is one of the largest opera houses in the world,
with more than 200 performances a season. With a 2013 operating
budget of $329 million, it has 1,600 full-time and seasonal
employees, plus 1,800 part-time workers, according to the bond
documents.  Falling Costs  The association sold as company interest rates are close to
record lows.  Corporate debt rated A and maturing in 15 years or longer
yields an average 4.21 percent, according to Bank of America
data. Borrowing costs have dropped from 5 percent a year ago and
reached an unprecedented low of 4 percent in July.  The Met’s losses from operations rose 7 percent last season
to $135 million, according to bond documents.  Peter Clark , a spokesman for the Met, didn’t have an
immediate comment when contacted via e-mail.  Proceeds from the sale will also pay operating expenses,
according to bond documents. The notes are taxable securities in
the corporate market because of that use, Eric Wild, a managing
director in the public finance group at Morgan Stanley, said
before they were priced.  The Moody’s report cited both strengths and challenges: The
organization has “uncommonly high amount of donor support,” with
average gift revenue of $145 million for the past three years.  Yet it also has “high reliance on gift revenue,” the report
said.  Box office sales for the first four months of 2012-13 have
trailed the Met’s projections and that of last season. The group
blamed  Hurricane Sandy  and the 2011 death of patron Agnes Varis,
who underwrote rush seats for which people pay $20 on weekdays
and $25 on weekends.  To contact the reporters on this story:
