Lara Gut won the first World Cup
downhill race of her career in Val d’Isere, as Olympic champion
 Lindsey Vonn  crashed.   Switzerland ’s Gut, 21, finished in a time of 1 minute,
19.75 seconds. Gut had been the second skier down the 2,143-
meter long French course, where the start gate had been lowered
by 100 meters because of high winds. Leanne Smith of the U.S.
was second at 0.16 second back, while Switzerland’s Nadja Kamer
clinched third spot at half a second behind.  Vonn, the Olympic champion from the U.S. who had won the
first four speed races of the season, caught an edge and crashed
at the top of the course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
