CTC Media (CTCM) , OAO Gazprom and channels
owned by billionaires  Alisher Usmanov  and  Yuri Kovalchuk  won
Russian digital television licenses as the country starts to
switch to the new technology.  CTC Media won licenses for its Domashny and CTC channel,
while Gazprom got them for its channels TNT and Sport NTV+,
Alexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor, the country’s
telecommunication and mass-media regulator, told reporters in
Moscow today. Billionaire Yuri Kovalchuk’s  Ren TV  and
billionaire Alisher Usmanov’s Muz TV also obtained licenses.  Independent channel  Rain TV  wasn’t chosen by the tender
commission due to its political format and potential uncertainty
of funding, Zharov said. Billionaire  Vladimir Potanin ’s
entertainment channel 2x2 also lost the race.  Russia plans to fully complete its switch to digital in
2015, giving the population of the world’s largest country by
territory access to a larger number of television channels.
Major state-run channels and others chosen by the government got
digital licenses for free.  The 10 winners announced today will have to pay about $31
million a year each to fund the state’s infrastructure for
digital transmission, according to Zharov. The winners, which
also include state-owned TVC, army channel Zvezda, VGTRK Sport
and Mir, are also paying a $1.2 million down payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
