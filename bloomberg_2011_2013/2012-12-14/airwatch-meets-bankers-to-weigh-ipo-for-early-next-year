AirWatch LLC , a maker of security
and data-management software for mobile devices, is talking to
bankers as it considers an initial public offering for early
next year.  The Atlanta-based company may seek to raise at least $150
million and is meeting with financial advisers including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., co-founder Alan Dabbiere said. AirWatch has no outside investors and may still
opt to remain private, he said.  Founded in 2003, AirWatch has  grown  as more corporations
rely on its software to manage and protect sensitive business
information on workers’s smartphones and tablets. With tools to
fend off hackers, wipe information from lost devices and upgrade
applications, AirWatch competes with vendors such as MobileIron
Inc. and Good Technology Inc. in a market that researcher
Radicati Group Inc. expects to reach  more than $1.12 billion  by
the end of 2016.  “We’ve looked at going public very soon,” Dabbiere said
in an interview. After an IPO, “We’d have a war chest for
acquisitions. It’s just good to have a strong cash balance.”  As revenue has surged, AirWatch has grown to 1,000
employees, up from 150 two years ago, Dabbiere said. While
declining to provide sales figures, he said revenue is growing
about 40 percent each quarter.  The previous company Dabbiere founded,  Manhattan Associates
Inc. (MANH) , sold shares at $15 apiece in an IPO in 1998. Shares in the
company, which sells computerized systems to help move goods
through distribution centers, have more than tripled since then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
