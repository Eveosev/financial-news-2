Mexico’s peso headed for its second
weekly advance as speculation grew that President Enrique Pena
Nieto will persuade the nation’s lawmakers to rally behind his
plans to boost growth and fiscal stability.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 12.7423 per  U.S. dollar  at 4
p.m. in Mexico City and has appreciated 0.8 percent since Dec.
7, the most among major Latin American currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. It has strengthened 9.4 percent this year.  The peso is reflecting “the confidence of foreign
investors in the local market,”  Mario Copca , a strategist at
Metanalisis SA in Mexico City, said in a phone interview.
“There have been political agreements, which had been hard to
come by in previous years.”  Pena Nieto, who took office Dec. 1, pushed this week for a
balanced 2013 budget, and the Senate followed the lower house
yesterday in approving the revenue portion. The progress adds to
speculation that Pena Nieto will win approval for economic
overhauls that boost private investment in the  energy industry 
and increase tax revenue.  State-run  Petroleos Mexicanos  has had a monopoly on
production, exploration and refining since President  Lazaro
Cardenas  nationalized the oil industry in 1938.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the peso compared with
those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- rose to a record
149,271 on Dec. 11, compared with net longs of 118,962 a week
earlier, according to data from the Washington-based Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.46 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.20 centavo to 139.87
centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
