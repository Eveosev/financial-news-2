Skip Holtz was chosen as Louisiana
Tech Universityâ€™s football coach, two weeks after being fired by
the University of South Florida.  Holtz, the 48-year-old son of former Notre Dame football
coach Lou Holtz, replaces Sonny Dykes, who left Louisiana Tech
last week to take the coaching job at the University of
 California .  Louisiana Tech, which went 9-3 this season, announced the
hiring of Holtz on its website. It is joining Conference USA
next season from the Western Athletic Conference.  Holtz was fired by South Florida after the Bulls posted a
3-9 record this season and a 16-21 record over three years. In
13 seasons at  Connecticut , East Carolina and South Florida,
Holtz has an 88-71 coaching record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
