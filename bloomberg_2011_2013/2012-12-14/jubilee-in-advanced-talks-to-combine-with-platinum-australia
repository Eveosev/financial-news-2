Jubilee Platinum Plc (JLP)  said it’s in
advanced talks to combine with  Platinum Australia Ltd. (PLA)  and link
operations in South Africa.  The merger would be implemented through a so-called scheme
of arrangement, it said in a statement. Jubilee expects to
reopen Platinum Australia’s Smokey Hills mine in the second half
of 2013 at a rate of 70,000 ounces of platinum group metals a
year.  The shares of Jubilee jumped 22 percent to 9.125 pence in
London, the highest in two months. It was their biggest gain in
11 months.  Jubilee has a market value of 29 million pounds ($47
million). Perth-based Platinum Australia appointed administrator
Pitcher Partners in June, stating it had been experiencing
operational problems at the Smokey Hills for some time. In
October, the administrators said the company had received
multiple offers to acquire some or all of its assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
