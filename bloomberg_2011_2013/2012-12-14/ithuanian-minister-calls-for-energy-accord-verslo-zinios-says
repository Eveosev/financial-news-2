Lithuaniaâ€™s new energy minister said
leaders must finally agree on an energy strategy just as they
did to achieve membership in the European Union and NATO, Verslo
Zinios reported.  Jaroslav Neverovic, 38, who was chief executive of the
company building a power link between Lithuania and  Poland 
before taking office yesterday, said he thought the main
objective should be fostering competition in energy markets,
according to an interview in the newspaper today.  Lithuania must complete power links with Poland and  Sweden 
by the end of 2015, finish a new liquefied natural-gas terminal
as fast as possible, start work on a gas pipeline link with
Poland, seek EU aid and get Latvian and Estonian participation
in the project, the paper quoted him as saying.  Regarding plans to build a nuclear plant, which voters
rejected in an October referendum, Neverovic said extensive
analysis and public discussion were now needed, Verslo Zinios
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
