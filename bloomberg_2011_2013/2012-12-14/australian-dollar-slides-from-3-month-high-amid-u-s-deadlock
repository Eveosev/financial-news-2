The Australian and New Zealand
dollars rose, erasing earlier losses, after a private report
showed Chinese manufacturing may expand at a faster pace,
boosting trade prospects.  The so-called Aussie climbed to a nine-month high against
the yen, while the kiwi reached the strongest level since
October 2008 versus  Japan ’s currency on speculation the
country’s elections this weekend will lead to a government that
will increase pressure on the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to expand monetary
stimulus. Demand for the South Pacific nations’ dollars was
limited as a standoff in U.S. budget negotiations sapped
investor appetite for risk.  The Chinese manufacturing data in December “is a slight
improvement from the previous month and it’s continuing to
suggest that Chinese growth is stabilizing,” said Janu Chan, an
economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The reaction has
been quite muted on the Aussie. What is perhaps offsetting its
gain is that financial markets in general are still concerned
about the outcome of negotiations in the U.S. in regards to the
fiscal cliff.”  The Aussie added 0.1 percent to $1.0544 as of 4:32 p.m. in
Sydney from yesterday, after earlier sliding as much as 0.2
percent. It’s set for a 0.5 percent weekly gain, having touched
$1.0586 on Dec. 12, the strongest since Sept. 14. It climbed 0.4
percent to 88.45  yen , after touching 88.47, the highest since
March 20.  New Zealand ’s currency, known as the kiwi, rose 0.2 percent
to 84.46 U.S. cents from yesterday when it reached as high as
84.61, the most since Feb. 29. It gained 0.5 percent to 70.85
yen, after reaching 70.86, the strongest since October 2008.  The yield on  Australia ’s 10-year government debt rose as
much as nine basis points, or 0.00 percentage point to 3.39
percent, the most since Sept. 18.  Chinese Manufacturing  A report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
indicated Chinese manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in
December. The preliminary reading for the purchasing managers’
index rose to 50.9 from 50.5 the previous month, above the 50
level that indicates expansion.  That compared with the median estimate of 50.8 in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  China  is Australia’s
biggest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-largest export
market.  Unlimited Stimulus  Japan’s Shinzo Abe, whose opposition  Liberal Democratic
Party  leads in opinion polls before the Dec. 16 ballot, has
called for a doubling of the central bank’s inflation goal to 2
percent and unlimited easing to revive growth.  The BOJ said today its  Tankan index  for sentiment among
large companies fell to minus 12 in December from minus 3 in
September, a fifth-straight negative reading and the lowest
since March 2010.  The Australian dollar has risen 0.7 percent so far in 2012
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The kiwi
dollar’s 6.5 percent advance over the same period is the best
performance among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
the gauges. The yen has lost 12 percent, the biggest loser.  In the U.S., Republicans and Democrats remain deadlocked
over how to avoid more than $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts that will take effect from January unless Congress
averts them, a scenario that threatens to throw the world’s
biggest economy back into recession.  The U.S. budget standoff has “probably contributed to the
Aussie coming off a little,” said Greg Gibbs, a Singapore-based
senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.
“I’m not overly convinced that both currencies are going to
continue moving up against the  U.S. dollar .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
