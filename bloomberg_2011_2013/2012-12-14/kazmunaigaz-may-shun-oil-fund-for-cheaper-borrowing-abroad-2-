KazMunaiGaz National Co.,
 Kazakhstan ’s state energy producer, may cancel plans to raise
$2.5 billion by selling bonds to the National Oil Fund next year
as borrowing abroad could be cheaper.  KazMunaiGaz, which has received initial approval from the
government to tap the oil fund, may borrow abroad “if it’s less
expensive,” Nurlan Rakhmetov, a managing director of the
Samruk-Kazyna sovereign wealth fund that owns the energy
producer, said in an interview yesterday from the capital of
Astana.  Near-zero  interest rates  in the U.S. and  Europe  are
spurring record borrowing worldwide, with emerging market
issuers selling $1.15 trillion of bonds so far this year, a 43
percent jump from the same period in 2011, data collected by
Bloomberg show. Russia’s state-owned oil company OAO Rosneft
sold $3 billion of bonds to international investors Nov. 29, the
biggest offering of foreign debt by a Russian corporation on
record.  Samruk-Energy JSC yesterday sold five-year bonds with a
yield of 3.75 percent.  Development Bank  of Kazakhstan JSC, a
state-owned lender, last month sold $1 billion of 10-year bonds
at a yield of 4.326 percent.  The yield on KazMunaiGaz’s dollar-denominated notes due in
2020 fell seven basis points to 3.222 percent today, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Selling Bonds  KazMunaiGaz, which accounts for about a quarter of the
nation’s oil output, planned to raise $2.5 billion selling bonds
to the National Oil Fund in 2013, and $1.5 billion from the oil
fund in 2015, it said in March. The company said at the time it
was in talks with the government about the interest rate.  KazMunaiGaz will borrow from the oil fund mainly to
refinance debt it issued to invest in the development of the
Kashagan project, Rakhmetov said. The company has about $3.1
billion of  debt  due by the end of next year, out of a total of
$13.7 billion outstanding, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  KazMunaiGaz’s net income is estimated at about 358 billion
tenge ($2.38 billion) this year, Rakhmetov said. The company
wants to sell non-core assets with a paper value of 95 billion
tenge, and has already raised 12.7 billion tenge from sales to
date, he said.  -- With assistance from Denis Maternovsky in Moscow. Editors:
