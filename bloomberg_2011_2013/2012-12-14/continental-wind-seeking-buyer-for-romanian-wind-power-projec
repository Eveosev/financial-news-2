Continental Wind Partners LLC, the
U.S. renewable-energy company that developed  Europe ’s largest
wind farm, is seeking a buyer for a wind project in Romania that
will generate enough power for 400,000 homes.  Construction at the Independenta project in Galati county
will start once a sale is complete, which is expected in the
first half of next year, Marta Pruszynska, the project director,
said in an e-mail Dec. 12. It has permits for 113 turbines and
will have capacity of 232 megawatts.  Romania is attracting investors including  GDF Suez (GSZ)  and  Enel
SpA (ENEL)  because of its renewables incentive program, which grants
green certificates for energy produced from renewable source
that power distributors must buy.  Continental Wind, based in Wilmington, Delaware, developed
Europe’s largest onshore wind farm, the 600-megawatt Fantanele
Cogealac plant, in eastern  Romania  and sold it to the Czech
utility CEZ AS in 2008. CEZ said yesterday it has connected the
last of the project’s 240 turbines to the power grid.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
