Heavy Canadian crude fell on the
spot market to a new low against the U.S. benchmark after  BP Plc (BP/) 
was said to delay for at least three months a project to run
more heavy oil at its Whiting refinery in Indiana.  West Canada Select tumbled $5.50 to a discount of $42.50 a
barrel versus West Texas Intermediate oil at 11:40 a.m. New York
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the largest
discount since Bloomberg began tracking WCS prices in May 2008.  The new timeline to finish converting a 225,000-barrel-a-
day crude unit to process heavy crude is between June 1 and Aug.
15, from the original estimate of March, said a person familiar
with operations, who asked not to be identified because the
information isn’t public.  BP said on its website that project is scheduled to come on
stream in the second half of 2013.  The project will increase the amount of heavy Canadian
crude the 420,000-barrel-a-day  refinery  can process to about 85
percent of total capacity, from 20 percent, according to BP’s
website. That would be more than one-fifth of the oil that the
Midwest imported from Canada in September.  Syncrude, a synthetic light, sweet oil upgraded from tar-
like bitumen from Canada, fell $1.35 to a 50-cent discount to
WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
