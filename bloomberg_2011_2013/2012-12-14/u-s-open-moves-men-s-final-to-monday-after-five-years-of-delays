The men’s final at the U.S. Open
will be scheduled for Monday next year after the Grand Slam
tennis tournament faced player complaints about too many matches
in too few days.  The U.S. Tennis Association, which runs the event in New
York, said the men’s championship will be set for 5 p.m. on
Sept. 9, with the women’s final at 4:30 p.m. the previous day.  The last five tournaments at the National Tennis Center
have been plagued by rain that forced the men’s final to be
played on Monday. Players last year complained that the schedule
of semifinals and finals on consecutive days gave them no time
to recuperate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
