The  Cincinnati Bengals  defeated the
Philadelphia Eagles 34-13 to move ahead of the Pittsburgh
Steelers in the standings for the final playoff spot in the
American Football Conference.  BenJarvus Green-Ellis, quarterback  Andy Dalton , Wallace Gilberry and A.J. Green had touchdowns for the Bengals, who
scored 24 unanswered second-half points at Lincoln Financial
Field in Philadelphia last night.  Cincinnati is 8-6, while Pittsburgh is 7-6 ahead of its
Dec. 16 visit to the  Dallas Cowboys . The Steelers -- who hold
the tiebreaker by virtue of their 24-17 win at Cincinnati on
Oct. 21 -- host the Bengals on Dec. 23 in the next-to-last week
of the National Football League regular season. Cincinnati then
hosts the  Baltimore Ravens , who lead the Bengals and Steelers in
the AFC North with a 9-4 record.  The  New York  Jets (6-7) are 1 1/2 games behind Cincinnati
in the battle for the final wild-card playoff spot. New York
next plays Dec. 17 at  Tennessee .  The Bengals lost in the first round of the playoffs last
season to the Houston Texans and last reached the postseason in
consecutive years in 1981-82. They haven’t won a playoff game
since Jan. 6, 1991, against the  Houston Oilers .  Philadelphia, which snapped an eight-game losing streak
Dec. 9 against  Tampa Bay , dropped to 4-10 with its fifth defeat
at home this year.  Green-Ellis capped Cincinnati’s opening drive with a 1-yard
touchdown run and Josh Brown added a 24-yard field goal on the
visitors’ next possession.  Dalton’s Fumbles  Philadelphia cut the deficit when quarterback Nick Foles
found Riley Cooper for an 11-yard score three minutes, 14
seconds into the second quarter.  Alex Henery tied it at 10-10 four minutes later with a 22-
yard field goal after Dalton fumbled on a sack. Another fumble
by Dalton on a sack handed Philadelphia possession at
Cincinnati’s 12-yard line with 1:52 to play in the half. The
Eagles had to settle for a 20-yard field goal to lead 13-10 at
the break.  After running eight yards to earn a first down, Dalton
scored on an 11-yard sprint with 1:16 remaining in the third
quarter to give Cincinnati the lead for good. Two plays later,
Gilberry returned a fumble 25 yards for a touchdown to make it
24-13 for the Bengals.  Brown added a 32-yard field goal at the start of the fourth
quarter to extend Cincinnati’s lead before another fumble on the
kickoff gave the Bengals the ball again. Dalton then found Green
with a 5-yard touchdown pass to make it 34-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
