Romanian President Traian Basescu
said he will call Parliament to convene immediately after the
results of Dec. 9 general elections are published in the
official journal as they are “untainted.”  Basescu, who needs to start negotiations with the winners
of the election on designating a premier and forming a new
government, may open the assembly on Dec. 19 at 1 p.m. in
Bucharest, after current lawmakers’ terms expire to avoid
“overlapping” parliaments.  “I want a very close deadline so that the state
institutions will be back on their feet fast,” Basescu told
reporters in Brussels after a meeting of European Union heads.  Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s Social Liberal Union, or USL,
won 67 percent of the 588 parliamentary seats at the polls,
giving him a two-thirds majority in Parliament. Ponta plans to
boost his legislative power with the help of the ethnic
Hungarian party and the minorities party, hoping to persuade
Basescu, his arch rival, to approve him as premier.  Romania was engulfed in a power struggle between Ponta and
Basescu during the summer, which culminated with a 52-day
suspension for the president, followed by an invalidated
nationwide impeachment vote on July 29.  “In my opinion the elections were held normally and their
result was untainted by different incidents,” Basescu said.  He also said he has “no worries” that the ruling
coalition will have a two-thirds majority in the legislature.  To contact the reporter on this story:
