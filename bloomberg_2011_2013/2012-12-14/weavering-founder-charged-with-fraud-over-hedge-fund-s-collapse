Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd. founding
director Magnus Peterson was charged by British prosecutors with
fraud and fraudulent trading over the collapse of the hedge fund
in 2009.  Peterson, 49, was also charged with false accounting and
forgery in the six years leading up to Weavering’s demise, the
 Serious Fraud Office  said in an e-mailed statement today. The
fund had about $640 million under management in late 2008. It
collapsed in March 2009 and was put into administration.  Weavering was an English incorporated firm whose primary
function was to act as  investment adviser  to the Cayman Islands-
based Weavering Macro Fixed Income Fund Ltd., the SFO said.
Peterson, a Swedish citizen living in Kent,  England , is
scheduled to appear in Jan. 7.  The SFO reopened its probe into Peterson and the collapse
of the hedge fund in July after the agency’s previous director
closed the case last year.  Peterson’s lawyer, Monty Raphael, didn’t immediately
respond to a request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
