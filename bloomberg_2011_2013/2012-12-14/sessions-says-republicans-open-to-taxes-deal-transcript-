Republican Pete Sessions of  Texas ,
the incoming House Rules Committee chairman, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend, that lawmakers in his party would
be willing to accept an increase in tax rates for top earners if
Democrats make significant reductions in entitlement programs
such as Social Security and Medicare.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

the House Rules Committee, Pete Sessions of Texas. Mr. Chairman,
I can call you that now, thank you for being with us. Let me
just certify something, that you think that the fiscal cliff
crisis is being caused primarily by the White House. They think
it’s being caused primarily by you, so we’ll certify that. But
let me just ask you now, what are the probabilities that we’ll
have some kind of an accord before Jan. 1?  REPRESENTATIVE PETE SESSIONS: We’ve got to do it to avoid
the loss of some 700,000 jobs, and Republicans are ready today
to deal.  HUNT: Do you - do you have an offer on the table?  SESSIONS: We do have an offer on the table.  HUNT: On entitlements?  SESSIONS: We have an offer on the table, and what we’re
asking the president to do is to match his offer with our offer,
and let’s - let’s work a deal together.  HUNT: How big is your entitlement package?  SESSIONS: Well, the entitlement is very interesting. If we
look at what lies ahead for this country, the insolvency of
these programs is what’s at risk. We’ve got to make changes now.
Now’s the time.  HUNT: But are you proposing things like raising the
 retirement age , like changing the COLA, like means testing? Is
that specifically on the table as a proposal?  SESSIONS: If that is what it takes as the two parties
agreeing in  Washington , D.C., for the solvency of the problem
for the long, yes we are.  HUNT: OK. If they agree on that, would you then say, even
though I don’t like it - because they don’t like that - would
you agree and say, I’ll swallow my reservations about tax rates?
We’ll go to 39.6.  SESSIONS: Well, here’s - here’s what we’re after, and we’ve
had this history in dealing with the president. We had a big
issue with him on  Social Security  the last couple years and on
debt limit. We’ve got to do something about the solvency of this
country, and we have to worry about jobs. And that’s why
Republicans are saying no right now. Because the loss of 700,000
American jobs --  HUNT: But this is a trade-off. You’re not going to get
everything you want. There was an election. You know that. If
they do what you want largely on entitlements, will you go along
with them on the tax rates?  SESSIONS: If it’s a good deal, yes. If it does something
long term that betters the circumstances -  HUNT: So if they get - if they go entitlements, you think
it’s a good deal on that, you would not - you wouldn’t like it,
but you’d go along with tax rates?  SESSIONS: I think  John Boehner , who is as the speaker the
lead and the sole negotiator on behalf of us, is looking for a
way to avoid going off the cliff for this country and the
marketplace.  HUNT: So I’m not over-reading this by saying that if they -
they have to deliver, but if they do, you guys may swallow your
reservations.  SESSIONS: It takes both sides.  HUNT: OK.  SESSIONS: The president would have to do equally as we do.  HUNT: I am told that a lot of your members are petrified of
Grover Norquist, that if they voted a deal that Grover Norquist
would primary them, and most - and a lot of  House Republicans 
know they can win general elections but they’re petrified they’d
be primaried if they voted for any kind of a deal.  SESSIONS: Well, that would be like me saying I’m for a deal
now if we make a deal. Let’s see what it is. We are not
petrified.  Grover Norquist  stands on the side of what many of us
believe, and that is the free-enterprise system and job growth,
 job creation . And that’s where we ought to be. If this deal
happens, we get along with that same message. And that is saving
American jobs and doing something about long-term solvency.  HUNT: Well, let me ask you this. Can you get this done by
Jan. 1? Because boy, the clock is ticking.  SESSIONS: Good question. And that’s where Republicans also
have a reservation. The deal that is done, the American people
need to understand it. We’re not going to do something in the
dark, late at night where no one knows what the practical effect
and outcome is. If we do that, we do get primaried.  HUNT: So what it has to really be is kind of memorandums of
understanding with enforcement mechanisms and all that. Because
you can’t obviously overhaul entitlements and the  tax code  in a
matter of 12 days.  SESSIONS: We can come to a specific agreement. You’re
right. We ought to know what the outcome would be.  HUNT: Right. So what you’re saying is now you’re coming to
something that gets you past the fiscal cliff with some - some
enforcement mechanism to do it next year.  SESSIONS: That’s the way I see it.  HUNT: OK. How about the debt ceiling? The White House says
the debt ceiling’s got to be taken off the table.  SESSIONS: Well, the debt ceiling, it would be imprudent for
us to say that the president of the  United States  can - can
raise debt and do what he chooses to do. This is a
constitutional government. This is not a monarchy or a
dictatorship. I’m not suggesting that we should ever cave in,
but we need to come to an agreement ahead of time and get away
from these deadlines. The president needs to know that we’re
willing to negotiate on that item, as well as the CR that will
happen at the end of March.  HUNT: You’re suggesting that the - that the debt ceiling
won’t be part of that package.  SESSIONS: I’m suggesting I do not believe it will or
necessarily would be.  HUNT: OK. All right. Is that a flat no?  SESSIONS: What - what you’ve heard me say is it takes two
sides to accept offers. And I think we’re far enough apart where
we got to get close enough on some middle ground. And finding
mid ground does not necessarily get to a CR or the long-term
debt.  HUNT: There was an election. You did very well in Texas,
but the Democrats did well in most of the country. They won the
presidency by a - by a fairly decent margin. They did great in
the Senate. And that - the issue of tax cuts for the wealthy was
debated, and the  Republican Party , consultants and everyone,
says that one of your problems is you were viewed too much as
the party of privilege. You’re viewed too much as the party of
the rich and not enough the party of the middle class. So the
first fight is over protecting tax cuts for the rich. Isn’t that
a political miscalculation of epic proportions?  SESSIONS: One could say that, but if somebody doesn’t stand
up for knowing where we’re headed and saying we’re not going to
go that direction, the loss of 700,000 jobs, the president put
that on the table as the starting salvo for the Democrat Party.
On the floor two days ago, Speaker Pelosi and every Democrat
came down and said, we are for this. Well, there has to be a
deal that’s cut where we include jobs in our future. So
Republicans lost eight seats by less than 18,000 total votes of
those eight seats. No, I think the debate’s still alive and well
in America.  HUNT: Mr. Chairman, just so I’m not misinterpreting, my
sense of what you’re saying is that you think it is possible and
essential to come to some kind of a deal to avoid the fiscal
cliff by Jan. 1 that does some things but sets in motion with
some kind of mechanism a procedure where you really deal with
the big issues next year.  SESSIONS: Must do it. And --  HUNT: But is that a correct interpretation?  SESSIONS: It would be. I believe that two sides can come
together and negotiate in the best interest. But as the
president says, this is a mostly political deal now. It
certainly is for them. And what is - what we’re on the side of
is not losing 700,000 jobs. Absent that, we’re for the deals.  HUNT: Let me ask you one more question. You, like me, are
the - are the parent of a child with disabilities. Were - and
you’ve been supportive of disabilities rights. Were you shocked
when Republicans in the Senate last week after  Bob Dole , the
former leader, came in a wheelchair to - to request approval for
the United Nations resolution on people with disabilities, that
the Senate rejected that?  SESSIONS: Another issue was attached to that also. And that
was people who are not just disabled, but children. And when you
added in children, not just disabled, that’s where Senate
Republicans had a problem with the UN resolution.  HUNT: But that was - that was a canard, and you know -you
know -  SESSIONS: It can - it can be as shrill as you want to be.  HUNT: - wouldn’t you like - wouldn’t you like them to see
them pass that resolution?  SESSIONS: You know what I’d like? I’d like it if we came to
an understanding in this country that disabled people deserve a
right to have jobs and the help from people to be able to do
that. They’re the first to lose their jobs.  HUNT: And you’ve been very forceful in that, I know. All
I’m saying is that wouldn’t be better to have an international -
to sign an international treaty because we’re better than most
other countries on that issue?  SESSIONS: I’d like to say we are, and that’s why we have
laws that we do that protect children that are underage and
disabled people.  HUNT: Would you have voted for that treaty?  SESSIONS: I didn’t study it enough to vote for it. I am a
proud member of the United States House of Representatives and
will be pleased to take these same ideas forward and sell them
in the House.  HUNT: Chairman Sessions, thank you so much for being here.
It’s going to be a fascinating time ahead.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
