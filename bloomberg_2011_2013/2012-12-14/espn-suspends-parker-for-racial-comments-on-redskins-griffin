ESPN suspended commentator Rob
Parker for what the network called “inappropriate” race-
related comments about Washington Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III.  Parker was “suspended until further notice” by the  Walt
Disney (DIS)  Co.-owned network a day after questioning on the air
whether Griffin is “authentically” black. ESPN said it’s
conducting a full review.  “My question, which is just a straight, honest question,
is … is he a brother or is he a cornball brother?” Parker said
on the ESPN’s “First Take” program. “He’s not really. He’s
black, but he’s not really down with the cause. He’s not one of
us. He’s kind of black, but he’s not really like the guy you’d
want to hang out with.”  “We all know he has a white fiancee,” continued Parker,
who is black. “There was all this talk about how he’s a
Republican.  Tiger Woods  was like, ‘I’ve got black skin but don’t
call me black.’”  This isn’t the first time Parker has been the center of
controversy.  While at the  Detroit News , he asked then-Lions coach Rod Marinelli whether he wished his daughter had married a better
defensive coordinator. Joe Barry, the team’s defensive
coordinator at the time, was the coach’s son-in-law.  The newspaper’s managing editor called the question
inappropriate and unprofessional.  To contact the reporter on this story:
