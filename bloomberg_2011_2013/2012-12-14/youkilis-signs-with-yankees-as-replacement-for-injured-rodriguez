Kevin Youkilis  signed a one-year
contract with the  New York Yankees , giving the team an
established third baseman with  Alex Rodriguez  facing six months
of recovery from hip injury.  Ichiro Suzuki is close to returning to the Yankees,
completing the terms of a new contract that would keep the
outfielder in New York for the next two seasons,  ESPN said.   The Yankees didn’t disclose financial terms of Youkilis’s
free-agent contract in a statement. The deal is worth $12
million, MLB.com reported yesterday, without saying where it got
the information.  Youkilis, 33, helped the Boston Red Sox win World Series
titles in 2004 and 2007 before being traded to the Chicago White
Sox last June.  He’s a .283 hitter with 148 home runs, 610 runs batted in
and 531 walks during his nine-year Major League Baseball career.
Youkilis’s .385 on-base percentage ranks fourth in the American
League from 2008 to 2012, and the 4.3 pitches he’s seen per
plate appearance is second among active major-leaguers, behind
 Jayson Werth  of the Washington Nationals.  An experienced first and third baseman, Youkilis played 111
games at third last season and 112 in 2011. Rodriguez will
probably miss the first three months of the 2013 season because
of a hip injury that will require surgery in January.  Less Money  Suzuki, 39, will take less money than he was offered by
other teams and sign a two-year deal worth a total of between
$12 million and $13 million, ESPN said, citing an unidentified
person in baseball who was briefed on the negotiations.  An All-Star every year from 2001 to 2010 while playing for
the Seattle Mariners, Suzuki was traded to  New York  in July,
hitting .322 with five home runs, 27 RBI and 14 stolen bases in
67 games with the Yankees.  After accumulating 1,278 hits playing for the Orix Blue
Wave in Japan’s Pacific League, Suzuki has 2,606 major-league
hits since joining the Mariners in 2001, leaving him 394 from
joining Major League Baseball’s 3,000-hit club, of which there
are 28 members. He’s had 10 200-hit seasons, a record, the most
recent in 2010. He had 178 hits last season.  Suzuki is a career .322 batter in the major leagues with
104 homers, 660 RBI and 452 stolen bases.  The Yankees have been limiting new contracts this offseason
to one year as the club tries to get below a $189 million
payroll threshold for 2014, which would save it millions in
luxury tax payments. Pitchers Mariano Rivera,  Andy Pettitte  and
 Hiroki Kuroda  and outfielder  Brett Gardner  all agreed on one-
year deals, while catcher  Russell Martin  signed a two-year, $17
million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates, leaving New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
