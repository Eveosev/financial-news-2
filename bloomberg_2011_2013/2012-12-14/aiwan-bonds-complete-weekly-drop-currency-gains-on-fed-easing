Taiwan ’s government bonds fell this
week and the local currency approached a 15-month high after the
 Federal Reserve  said it will expand asset purchases to support
growth in the world’s largest economy.  The 10-year yield yesterday reached the highest level since
October after the Fed said on Dec. 12 it will start buying $45
billion a month of Treasuries, adding to $40 billion a month of
existing mortgage-debt purchases. Taiwan’s central bank will
review monetary policy on Dec. 19 and is expected to keep the
benchmark  interest rate  at 1.875 percent, according to all four
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Governor Perng Fai-nan said
Dec. 12 the economy, which shrank in the second quarter for the
first time since 2009, is rebounding steadily.  “Market sentiment has been risk-on this week as the Fed is
going to print more money,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income
trader in Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co. “The central bank
will probably keep borrowing costs unchanged as the situation
hasn’t changed much from the last meeting three months ago.”  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 climbed to 1.143 percent from 1.136 percent at
the end of last week, according to Gretai Securities Market. It
touched 1.146 percent yesterday, the highest level for a
benchmark 10-year rate since Oct. 26.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent this week and was
little changed today at NT$29.102 against its U.S. counterpart,
according to data from Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched
NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level since September 2011.
It has appreciated 4.1 percent this year, poised for a fourth
straight annual gain.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, dropped three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, this week to 2.92 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was 0.388 percent,
compared with 0.386 percent on Dec. 7, a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
