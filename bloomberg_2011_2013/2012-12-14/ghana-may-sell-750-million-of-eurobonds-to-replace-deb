Ghana , which sold the first
Eurobonds in sub-Saharan  Africa  outside of  South Africa  in 2007,
may issue a further $750 million of the debt to refinance the
earlier notes, which mature in October 2017.  “It is under consideration, among other options, to repay
the existing Eurobond,” Deputy Finance and Economic Planning
Minister Seth Terkper said by phone yesterday from the capital,
Accra. The sale may take place in 2013, he said, declining to
give details.  Ghana is considering selling a second Eurobond as it looks
for ways to finance development plans that will support its
growing economy, which is expanding at one of the fastest paces
in Africa. Most of the budget’s financing comes from tax
collection, loans and grants and bond sales on the domestic
market, where yields on the  benchmark  91-day notes climbed to
record of 23.1 percent on Oct. 12, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yield on Ghana’s 8.5 percent Eurobonds gained less than
1 basis point to 4.97 percent by 7:09 p.m. yesterday in Accra. A
basis point is equivalent to 0.01 percentage point.  In September, Finance and Economic Planning Minister
 Kwabena Duffuor  said the falling yield on the debut bonds made a
second sale attractive.  “It will be around the current market yield, and with that
we would be saving on government debt commitments,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
