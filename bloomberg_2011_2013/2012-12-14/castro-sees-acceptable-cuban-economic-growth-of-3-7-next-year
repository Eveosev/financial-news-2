Cuban President Raul Castro said
that economic growth will be at an “acceptable” 3.7 percent
next year as the communist government eases control over
businesses and employment.  The Caribbean nation’s economy expanded a less than
forecast 3.1 percent in 2012 even as tourist arrival jumped a
record 4.9 percent, Castro told the National Assembly yesterday.
The government had previously forecast growth of 3.4 percent for
this year, he said.  The growth forecast for next year “is acceptable in a
scenario of a continuing global economic crisis and persecution
of Cuban bank transactions” due to the U.S. embargo, Castro
said, according to a transcript of the  speech  posted on the
government-run website Granma.  Since his brother Fidel started handing over power in 2006,
Castro has taken measures to open the island’s economy,
including loosening of property laws and controls prohibiting
private enterprise such as taxi and mobile phone companies.
Cooperatives with as many as five employees began managing their
own operations this month, a policy meant to loosen restrictions
on basic services and increase productivity.  Almost 400,000 Cubans are now self-employed, a number that
should grow as the government allows more private enterprise,
Castro said.  He vowed support for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who
suffered complications while undergoing a six-hour cancer
surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11.  “At this crucial hour, we are as always, joining with
President Chavez,” Castro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
