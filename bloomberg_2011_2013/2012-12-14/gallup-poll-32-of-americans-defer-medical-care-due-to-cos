The following table ranks the percentage
of Americans that say they had to defer medical care for themselves
or their families in the past year due to the cost, according to a poll
conducted by Gallup.  People were asked: Within the last 12 months, have you or a
member of your family put off any sort of medical treatment because
of the cost you would have to pay?  The poll of 1,015 adults was conducted from Nov. 15-18.  The
sampling error is 4 percentage points.
