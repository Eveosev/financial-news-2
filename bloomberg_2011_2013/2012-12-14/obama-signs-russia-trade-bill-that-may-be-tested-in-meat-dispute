President  Barack Obama  signed into
law legislation that repeals Cold War-era trade restrictions
with Russia, amid a dispute over meat imports that may test the
new relationship.  The law, passed by the Senate on Dec. 6, enables the U.S.
to establish “permanent normal trade relations” with Russia, a
status required for all members of the World Trade Organization,
which Russia joined in August. Exporters including  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  and  Boeing Co. (BA)  have said the stronger ties will give them
improved access to the Russian market and better legal footing
at the WTO should trade disputes arise.  The first test of the law may soon emerge. U.S. Trade
Representative  Ron Kirk  and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack on
Dec. 8 called on Russia to suspend a new policy requiring that
U.S. pork and beef exports be tested to ensure they are free of
ractopamine, a feed additive. Russia’s policy is “inconsistent
with its obligations as a member of the  World Trade
Organization ,” the U.S. officials said in a statement.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Russia should
follow standards set by the UN Food & Agriculture Organization,
which are less stringent.  Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in
Washington, has said the policy isn’t retaliation for a
provision in the U.S. trade law that allows the U.S. to impose
financial and travel restrictions on human rights violators in
Russia. Russian officials have said that measure will harm
bilateral relations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
