  Peter Madoff , brother of imprisoned
Ponzi scheme operator  Bernard Madoff , should get a 10-year
prison term for his role in perpetuating the multibillion-dollar
fraud, U.S. prosecutors said.  Peter Madoff pleaded guilty in June in federal court in
Manhattan to enabling his brother to pull off the biggest Ponzi
scheme in U.S. history, though Peter denied knowing the business
was a sham until the firm collapsed.  ‘The government submits that a sentence of 10 years is
reasonable and appropriate in this case,’’ assistant U.S.
attorneys Lisa Baroni and Julian Moore said in a memo to the
judge who will sentence Madoff.  Peter Madoff, a lawyer who served as the chief compliance
officer of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, helped
his brother run the firm for four decades. Peter Madoff is
scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 20 by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain.  The case is U.S. v. Madoff, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
