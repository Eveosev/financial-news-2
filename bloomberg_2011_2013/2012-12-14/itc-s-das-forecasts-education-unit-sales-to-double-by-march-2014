Chand Das, chief executive of
education & stationery products business,  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , forecasts
revenue of his division will double to 10 billion rupees ($184
million) by March 31, 2014. He spoke in an interview.  On marketshare:  “The Indian government-run Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which is
free primary education for all, will fuel the growth in demand
for our products directly.  ‘‘Our notebooks have a 16 percent marketshare. We have a
strong distribution footprint that will help double our
marketshare in the next four to five years.  On imports from  China :  ‘‘In the last year or so, we are in the process of rapid
localization partly because of the rupee, which has depreciated
quite significantly. Import from China today is not viable.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
