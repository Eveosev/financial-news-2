Serbia expects investments in its
power and recycling plants may be worth 7 billion euros ($9.2
billion) to 12 billion euros over the next 10 years.  More than 6,000 megawatts may be added in new hydro and
coal-fired plants through 50 separate projects, according to the
“priority list” for power production and environmental
protection presented by Energy and Environment Minister Zorana
Mihajlovic in Belgrade today. Most projects envisage foreign
investors, such as  Germany ’s  RWE AG (RWE) , Italy’s Edison SpA and
 China ’s China Machinery Engineering Corp, according to the plan.  “Signing of construction contracts is expected to begin in
the first half of 2012” she said, without specifying.  The state will also adopt a set of by-laws by the end of
the year to help define conditions for investors, while also
reducing the number of permits for most projects to five from
27, Mihajlovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
