Italian and Spanish government bonds
advanced after a report showed euro-area services and
manufacturing output contracted at a slower pace in December,
underpinning demand for the region’s higher-yielding securities.  Portugal ’s 10-year yields dropped to the lowest since
February 2011 as European Union leaders meeting in Brussels
pledged to seek a joint strategy for handling failing banks.
Greek bonds rose for a sixth week after regional finance
ministers yesterday approved the next tranche of rescue funds
for the nation. German 10-year bunds completed a weekly decline.  “The data was a tad better than expectations,” said
Anders Moeller Lumholtz, a Copenhagen-based analyst at  Danske
Bank A/S. (DANSKE)  “This is another sign that the cycle in the euro-area
has bottomed. It is supportive for higher-yielding assets.”  Italy’s 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.60 percent at 5 p.m. London time, paring
this week’s increase to eight basis points. The 5.5 percent
security due November 2022 rose 0.31, or 3.10 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,313) face amount, to 107.465. The yield on similar-
maturity Spanish bonds fell one basis point to 5.39 percent.  A composite  index  based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries rose to 47.3 from 46.5 in November, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today. Economists forecast a reading
of 46.9, according to the median of 16 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey. A number below 50 indicates contraction.  The euro-area services index increased to 47.8 in December
from 46.7 in November, Markit said. The manufacturing gauge rose
to 46.3 from 46.2.  Confidence ‘Improved’  Portugal’s 10-year yield declined 15 basis points to 7.09
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 7, 2011.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of their German equivalents contracted 14 basis points
to 574 basis points, the narrowest since April 2011.  Today’s better-than-forecast data underline the view that
it will take a “renewed deterioration” in the economic outlook
for the  European Central Bank  to cut  interest rates , Bank of
America-Merrill Lynch London-based economists Nick Bate and
 Laurence Boone  wrote in a note to clients.  EU finance ministers meeting overnight in Brussels agreed
to put the ECB in charge of all euro-area lenders in a deal that
paves the way for the currency bloc’s firewall fund to provide
direct bailouts to banks.  ‘Key Points’  “We’ve agreed on the key points to create a European bank
supervision that’s supposed to start in 2014,” German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said after the meeting. The
agreement opens the way for negotiations to take place with the
European Parliament.  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield was little changed at 1.35
percent, having increased five basis points this week.  Volatility on German debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by those of Portugal and
 Netherlands , according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and
10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  The Greek 10-year yield dropped 144 basis points this week
to 13.02 percent, with the price rising to 44.38 percent of face
value. The securities were little changed today.  Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pledged to forge ahead
with policies to revive the recession-wracked country after
winning the release of emergency international aid to keep
 Greece  solvent.  “There is no time for rest,” Samaras told reporters in
Brussels after the EU summit. “One marathon has just ended, but
we are ready to start the next.”  German bonds returned 4.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italy’s
debt gained 20 percent and  Spain ’s rose 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
