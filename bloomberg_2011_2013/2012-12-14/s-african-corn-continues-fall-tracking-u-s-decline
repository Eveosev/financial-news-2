South African white corn futures
fell to the lowest in 11 weeks, tracking a decline in prices in
the U.S., the biggest producer of the grain.  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
fell 1.3 percent to 2,299.20 rand ($265) a metric ton, the
lowest since Sept. 28, by the close in Johannesburg. It’s
declined for six sessions. The yellow variety for July delivery
decreased 0.6 percent to 2,180 rand a ton, the lowest since Oct.
17. It’s dropped for seven sessions.  Corn for March delivery dropped as much as 0.3 percent to
$7.1775 a bushel, and yesterday fell to $7.15 a bushel, the
lowest intraday level since Nov. 16, on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Export  sales  of corn last week tumbled 49 percent from a
year earlier to 258,900 tons, government data  showed on Dec. 11.   “Our price is down because American prices are moving
downward, mainly due to their exports that are falling,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone today.  In South Africa, white corn is mainly used as one of the
country’s staple foods, while the yellow type is used as animal
feed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
