Latvia’s  economy  may grow more than
predicted next year as consumption in the Baltic nation helps
make up for slower exports to the debt-ridden euro area,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  Gross domestic product may advance 3.7 percent, compared
with a previous forecast of 3.5 percent growth, Shekhar Aiyar,
the lender’s mission chief to Latvia said yesterday in an
interview. That pace “is pretty healthy” and should accelerate
to 4 percent to 4.5 percent after 2013, he said.  “The recovery is now quite broad based, so it’s not just
an external demand story,” he said in a phone interview from
 Washington . “Domestic demand is returning.”  Latvia is paying off ahead of time the IMF’s contribution
to a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) bailout taken in 2008 after
its second-biggest bank needed a rescue, a real estate bubble
burst and global credit markets froze. The economy grew 5.2
percent from a year earlier in the third quarter, the ninth
consecutive period of expansion, after slumping more than a
fifth in 2008 and 2009.  The yield on  Latvia ’s dollar bond due 2020 was little
changed at 2.94 percent.  After borrowing costs plunged, the Baltic country is using
the proceeds of a $1.25 billion bond sale to repay its bailout
in full almost three years ahead of schedule.  In the wake of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.’s 2008 demise,
the government passed spending cuts and tax increases equal to
more than 16 percent of economic output to stabilize public
finances. After enduring devaluation pressure, the country’s
exchange-rate peg to the euro is now broadly in balance, Aiyar
said.  “It is a very laudable achievement, and it’s been a very
difficult adjustment and full credit to the authorities and also
to the people of Latvian for being able to do it,” he said.  The IMF supports Latvia’s goal of adopting the euro in 2014
because it would eliminate exchange-rate risk and may strengthen
the banking system, Aiyar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
