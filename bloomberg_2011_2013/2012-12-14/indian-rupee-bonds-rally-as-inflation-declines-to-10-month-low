India ’s bond yields fell to a seven-

November from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said in a
statement, compared with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey for a 7.6 percent gain. Prices climbed 7.45 percent in
October.  Asia ’s third-largest  economy  grew 5.3 percent in the
July-September quarter, according to the latest government data,
matching the slowest pace since 2009.  “With the easing of inflation, there is clearly scope for
the  Reserve Bank  of India to support growth,” said Vivek Rajpal, a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Mumbai. “It is
only a matter of time before they cut  interest rates .”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.14 percent as of
12:37 p.m., according to the central bank’s trading system.
That’s the lowest level since Oct. 29.  The rupee rose 0.3 percent to 54.31 per dollar as of 12:19
a.m. in Mumbai, erasing an earlier decline of as much as 0.4

basis points to 4 percent on Dec. 18, according to 13 of 17
economists in a Bloomberg survey. One predicted a 50 basis point
reduction, while the rest expect no change.  Interest Rates  The central bank, which last cut the repurchase  rate  by 50
basis points in April, will hold the rate at 8 percent the same

one predicting a 50 basis point cut. At the last policy review
on Oct. 30, Governor  Duvvuri Subbarao  signaled the monetary
