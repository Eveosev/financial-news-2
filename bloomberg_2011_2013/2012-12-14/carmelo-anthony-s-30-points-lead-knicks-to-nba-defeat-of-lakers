Carmelo Anthony scored 30 points
before leaving with a sprained ankle and the New York Knicks
opened a 26-point lead en route to a 116-107 home win against
the Los Angeles Lakers.  Anthony, who had 22 points in the opening quarter, left the
game midway through the third period and did not return. Knicks
coach  Mike Woodson  said it was a “slight sprain” of the left
ankle and that Anthony was day to day.  “Everything is good,” Anthony told reporters. “I’m real
sore right now -- ankle, knee, hip. It was an awkward fall.”  The Knicks (17-5), who have the best record in the National
Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference, improved  to 9-0
this season at Madison Square Garden. Last night’s win came on
the opening day of a six-game homestand. They next face the
Cleveland Cavaliers tomorrow night.  Anthony hit three 3-pointers in the opening 2 1/2 minutes
as the Knicks began the game with an 11-2 run. They led 41-27
after one period and 68-49 at halftime.  Kobe Bryant  had 31 points and 10 rebounds for the Lakers
(9-14), who have lost four straight and are 2-8 on the road this
season.  With Anthony sidelined after falling hard on a foul by
 Dwight Howard , the Lakers outscored the Knicks 46-38 in the
game’s final 19 minutes and pulled within six points in the
final period.  Raymond Felton  added 19 points for the Knicks, while  Tyson Chandler  and J.R. Smith had 18 each. Metta World Peace had 23
points and Howard had 20 for the Lakers.  Lakers coach  Mike D’Antoni , who took over in Los Angeles
three weeks ago, was booed by Knicks fans during pregame
introductions in his return to Madison Square Garden. He quit as
Knicks coach on March 14 while in the final season of a four-
year contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
