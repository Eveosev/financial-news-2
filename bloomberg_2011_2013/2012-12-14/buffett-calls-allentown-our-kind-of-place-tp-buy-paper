Warren Buffett , the billionaire
chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , told the Allentown Morning
Call that the Pennsylvania community is “our kind of place”
for investing in a newspaper.  Buffett, who has spent more than $340 million on 80
newspapers, was asked by the publication if he would consider
purchasing it. The Morning Call is owned by Tribune Co., which
may put dailies up for sale as the company emerges from
bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter said this week.  “We haven’t heard anything from the Tribune Co.,” Buffett
told the Morning Call after the newspaper e-mailed him an
inquiry. “But if the phone rings, I’ll answer.”  Buffett has said he  targets  newspapers in towns where there
is a sense of community. The newspaper industry is facing
shrinking demand for print advertising, declining circulation
and encroachment from Internet companies such as Google Inc. and
Facebook Inc.  Buffett didn’t return a message left by Bloomberg News with
an assistant seeking comment. Gary Weitman, a spokesman for
Chicago-based Tribune Co., declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
