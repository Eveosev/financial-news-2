The U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency today will announce standards for soot pollution that are
20 percent tighter than the current rule, according to a person
briefed on the matter.  The annual standards for particulate matter, or microscopic
particles released from automobile exhausts, power plants or
factories, will be set at 12 micrograms per cubic meter, down
from 15 micrograms now, the person said. The EPA faces a court-
set deadline to announce the standards today, and the person
declined to discuss the rule publicly before the agencyâ€™s public
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
