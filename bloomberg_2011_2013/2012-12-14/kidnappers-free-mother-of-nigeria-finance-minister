Kidnappers freed the 82-year-old
mother of Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala five
days after she was abducted from her home in the southern state
of Delta, a police spokesman said.  “She is in good health,” Frank Mba, a spokesman for the
federal police, said by phone today from Abuja, the capital.  The army arrested 63 people linked to the kidnapping of
Kaneme Okonjo in the town of Ogwasi-Ukwu where she was seized,
Rose Managbe, a Nigerian army spokeswoman, said by phone late
yesterday from the southern commercial hub of Onitsha. Two
police officers were also detained for alleged negligence in the
abduction.  Okonjo-Iweala, who became finance minister for the second
time in August 2011, has worked to reverse expansionary budgets
and backed President Goodluck Jonathan’s move to cut a subsidy
on gasoline in January. Under her tenure, the ministry also
rejected unverified subsidy claims by gasoline importers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
