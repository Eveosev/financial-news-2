Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund
may only sell shares in two state companies in so-called
People’s IPOs next year, rather than four as previously planned.  The fund, which owns the companies, is considering
proposing one initial public offering in the first half of 2013
and one in the second, Nurlan Rakhmetov, Samruk-Kazyna’s
managing director, said yesterday.  “This proposal is aimed at making it easier for
individuals” to invest by giving them more time to understand
the process and amass savings, he said in a phone interview from
the capital, Astana.  After raising 28 billion tenge ($186 million) from selling
about 10 percent of KazTransOil this month, the central Asian
nation had planned to sell shares in Kazakhstan Electricity Grid
Operating Co., KazMorTransFlot, Samruk Energy and KazTransGaz in
2013.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev , whose re-election last year
extended his rule into a third decade, ordered last February
that stock in state companies be offered to ordinary citizens to
help them increase their savings.  Kazakhstan Electricity is the “main candidate for an IPO
next year,” Rakhmetov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
