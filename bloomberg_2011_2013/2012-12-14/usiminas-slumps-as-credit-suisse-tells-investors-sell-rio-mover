Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA (USIM5) , the Brazilian steelmaker that rose 83 percent since mid-
year, headed to its lowest close in three weeks after Credit
Suisse Group AG recommended investors sell the stock after a
recent rally.  Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based company is
known,  fell  5.3 percent to 11.46 reais at the close in  Sao
Paulo . The third-worst performer in the Brazilian benchmark
Bovespa  index  today, closed at the lowest since Nov. 22.  Usiminas is the most expensive stock amid Latin America’s
metals and mining companies and shares may decline about 26
percent from current levels, Credit Suisse analysts led by Ivano Westin in Sao Paulo said, after cutting their recommendation to
the equivalent of sell from neutral. The stock may underperform
on weaker-than-expected earnings, slower growth in  Brazil  and
lower international steel prices, they said in a note to clients
dated yesterday.  “The recent outperformance of the stock is excessive,”
the analysts said in the note. “The market is overestimating
the benefits of the turnaround.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
