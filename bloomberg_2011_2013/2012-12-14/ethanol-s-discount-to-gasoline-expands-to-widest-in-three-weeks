Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded to the widest level in three weeks as the motor fuel
advanced on renewed economic optimism.  The fuels gained as Federal Reserve data showed U.S.
industrial production rose in November by the most in two years
and after a preliminary purchasing managers’ index said  China ’s
manufacturing is expanding at a faster pace this month. The
Energy Department said Dec. 12 that ethanol  stockpiles  were at
the highest level since June 29.  “We’re up a little bit,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “There certainly is a lot of supply. People aren’t
grabbing it up as fast as you would want.”  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline increased to 36.41 cents a
gallon from 31.21 cents yesterday, the widest spread since Nov.
21, based on futures settlement prices. The differential has
averaged 61.29 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery added 0.8 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $2.298 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
snapping the longest streak of declines since the period ended
July 26. The futures have climbed 4.3 percent this year.  Ethanol inventories last week rose 3.6 percent to 20
million barrels, while  production  declined 1.3 percent to
824,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department said. Imports of
the fuel in the week ended Dec. 7 sank to 12,000 barrels a day
from 92,000 barrels the previous week.  Brazilian Prices  Ethanol on the  Brazilian spot market  is fetching $2.06 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  declined 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.37 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
biofuel fell 1 cent to $2.35, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago slipped 0.5 cent to $2.285 a gallon and
on the West Coast the additive rose 4.5 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $2.46.  Gasoline for January delivery advanced 6 cents, or 2.3
percent, to settle at $2.6621 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery jumped 10.5 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $7.3075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 34 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 31
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
