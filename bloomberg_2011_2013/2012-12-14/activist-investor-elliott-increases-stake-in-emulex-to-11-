Elliott Management Corp., the
activist investor that pushed Novell Inc. to sell itself in
2010, has  amassed  more than an 11 percent stake in  Emulex Corp. (ELX) ,
a provider of converged networking solutions for data centers.  Elliott, the New York-based hedge-fund investor, said in a
 regulatory filing  yesterday it bought an additional 1.34 percent
stake in the company through derivative agreements. Elliott
reported a 9.96 percent stake in Emulex with a 13D filing Nov.
23, becoming the largest shareholder and gaining an opening to
agitate for change at the  Costa Mesa , California-based company.  Peter Truell , a spokesman for Elliott, and Katherine Lane,
a spokeswoman for Emulex, declined to comment.  Emulex has a market capitalization of about $597 million.
The stock gained 1.1 percent to $6.66 at 10:50 a.m. in New York.
Through yesterday, the stock had lost 3.9 percent this year.  Fund managers sometimes use their status as shareholders to
urge management to shift strategy or look for a buyout. Emulex
adopted a so-called poison pill in 2009 to fend off Broadcom
Corp.â€™s takeover approach.  Elliott made an unsolicited $2 billion offer for Novell
after building an 8.5 percent stake in the Linux software maker.
Novell was later bought by Attachmate Corp. for $2.2 billion.  More recently, Elliott pressed BMC Software Inc. for
several months to consider a sale, resulting in a $1 billion
share buyback announced Oct. 31. The activist investor amassed a
stake in Brocade Communications Systems Inc. as of August 2011,
and a year later Chief Executive Officer Michael Klayko said he
would step down after trying to sell the company for more than
two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
