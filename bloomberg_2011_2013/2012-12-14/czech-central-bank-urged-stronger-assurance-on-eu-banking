The  Czech Republic  should have
sought stronger assurances that the single European banking
supervisor won’t weaken its domestic regulatory powers, the
central bank said.  European Union leaders agreed to start work next year on a
single-resolution mechanism for euro-area banks to complement
the  European Central Bank ’s oversight role approved yesterday.
The Czech Republic, which isn’t a member of the 17-nation euro
area, had requested guarantees that the new supervisory
framework won’t weaken its domestic regulator, the central bank.  The Czech political representation didn’t fully incorporate
the central bank’s recommendations into its position, the
Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “In our opinion, the assurances given to the Czech
Republic could be stronger,” Miroslav Singer, the bank’s
governor, said in the statement. “In the final phases of the
negotiations, we at the CNB had a different view on the extent
to which the proposed compromise sufficiently allays the
concerns that we jointly identified at the outset together with
the other Czech authorities.”  The Czech Republic, which has no target date for joining
 Europe ’s single currency, is seeking to prevent an outflow of
deposits from local banks.  Deposits in Czech banks, mostly owned by foreign
institutions including Erste Group Bank AG,  KBC Groep NV (KBC)  and
Societe Generale SA, exceed loans by more than 30 percent,
according to central bank  statistics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
