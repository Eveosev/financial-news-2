Orange-juice futures that rallied to
a seven-month high yesterday may jump 16 percent further by mid-
February, according to  technical analysis  by Infinity Trading
Corp.  Prices will top $1.60 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , the highest since April 5, after completing the “cup-and-
handle” formation, said Fain Shaffer, the president of the
Medford, Oregon-based Infinity. The futures contract for
delivery in March closed yesterday at $1.375.  The so-called cup formation was created as March futures
slumped from a high of $1.3095 on Sept. 14, bottoming at $1.0675
on Oct. 31, before resuming gains in a U-shaped turn that peaked
Nov. 26 at $1.2865. When the price approaches its previous high,
investors who bought at or near that level tend to sell. That
occurred in the two weeks ended Dec. 10 that resulted in a so-
called handle.  “The cup-and-handle formation is a bullish indicator,”
Shaffer said yesterday in a Dec. 12 e-mail.  Orange juice  may
reach $1.6195 in the next 30 to 45 days, assuming a 50 percent
retracement from the low of 97.10 cents on May 18, Shaffer said.  Orange-juice futures through yesterday were down 18 percent
from a year earlier, after reaching $2.2695 on Jan. 23, the
highest on record for a most active contract.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
