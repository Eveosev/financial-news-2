Ukraine’s First Deputy Prime
Minister Valeriy Khoroshkovskiy quit, saying he disagreed with
the re-appointment of Mykola Azarov as premier.  Khoroshkovskiy submitted a resignation letter to President
 Viktor Yanukovych  because he thinks Azarov “incapable of
implementing economic reforms and protecting the country’s
course toward European integration,” his press service said
today in e-mailed statement from the capital, Kiev.  Khoroshkovskiy didn’t need to submit his notice as he was
removed de facto from his post by presidential decree on Dec. 12
after not being proposed as a member of the new government, the
Cabinet’s press service said in a statement on the government
 website .  Lawmakers yesterday approved the return of Azarov, who’d
served as prime minister since Yanukovych’s election in 2010
before resigning last week after his election to Parliament. His
candidacy was backed by the ruling Party of Regions and the
Communists.  The yield on the government’s bond due 2022 fell for a
fourth day to 7.653 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
The hryvnia declined to 8.1030 per dollar from yesterday’s close
of 8.1005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
