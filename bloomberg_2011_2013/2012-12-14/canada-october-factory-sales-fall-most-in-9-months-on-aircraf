Canadian  factory sales  fell faster
in October than economists forecast on declines in aircraft and
automobiles, while inventories reached the highest in almost
four years.  Sales fell 1.4 percent to C$48.8 billion ($49.5 billion),
the biggest decline since January, Statistics Canada said today
in Ottawa. Economists forecast a 0.1 percent decrease, the
median of 20 responses in a Bloomberg  survey .  Canada’s factory output has stagnated since reaching about
C$50 billion in December and remains threatened by  Europe ’s debt
crisis and U.S. negotiations to stave off about $600 billion of
tax increases and spending cuts due in January. Manufacturers
also are being held back by weak  productivity  gains and a high
dollar, which makes Canadian goods less competitive.  “The Canadian shipments report was plain awful,” said
 Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National Bank Financial
in  Montreal . The data adds to signs a Dec. 21 report will show
economic  growth  was limited to 0.1 percent in October, he said.  The Canadian dollar was little changed at 98.47 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 9:44 a.m. in Toronto. The currency has
strengthened by more than half against the greenback in the past
10 years. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0156.  Aerospace sales dropped 25.4 percent to C$1.25 billion in
October, following a 37.1 percent gain the previous month,
Statistics Canada said. Automobile sales fell 3.7 percent to
C$4.38 billion and primary metals declined 2.8 percent to C$3.72
billion.  Inventories Increase  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
2.4 percent in October.  Inventories rose 1.3 percent to C$66.2 billion, the highest
since January 2009. Stocks of petroleum and coal jumped 13.2
percent to C$5.43 billion and for aerospace they advanced 5.1
percent to C$4.84 billion. The ratio of factory stockpiles to
sales increased to 1.36 from 1.32, the highest since June 2011
according to the  Statistics Canada  figures.  Companies such as  Com Dev International Ltd. (CDV)  are feeling
the pinch. The maker of space-exploration equipment based in
Cambridge, Ontario, said Oct. 2 it was firing 31 employees on
reduced demand from the Canadian government.  Sales fell in 12 of 21  categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada, accounting for 71 percent of production. Excluding motor
vehicles and parts, sales decreased 1.2 percent to C$42.5
billion, Statistics Canada said.  Unfilled orders were little changed at C$61.9 billion in
October while new orders fell 0.6 percent to C$48.8 billion.  Today the September sales estimate was pared to show it was
little changed, from a 0.4 percent advance, and the August
increase was cut to 0.7 percent from 0.9 percent.  U.S. industrial production for November rose 1.1 percent on
a recovery after superstorm Sandy, the  Federal Reserve  said
today from  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
