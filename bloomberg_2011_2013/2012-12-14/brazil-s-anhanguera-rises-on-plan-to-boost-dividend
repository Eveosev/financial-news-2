Anhanguera Educacional Participacoes
SA (AEDU3) ,  Brazil ’s second-largest education company by market value,
rose the most in three months on a plan to increase dividend
payments in 2013 and cut debt by half.  Shares gained 3.5 percent to 33.95 reais at 5:35 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, the steepest one-day advance since Sept. 13. The
 BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV)  index rose 0.4 percent.  Anhanguera will increase dividends to 25 percent of net
income from 1 percent currently, according to a press officer.
The company also seeks to reduce debt in 2013 to less than once
its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, from two times this year.  “More dividends and less leverage, that sounds like music
to investors’ ears,” Sandro Fernandes, a trader at brokerage
Corval, said by phone from  Belo Horizonte , Brazil. “Education
companies in Brazil are growing a lot because more people have
access to universities and the government provides students with
cheap credit.”  Anhanguera’s adjusted net income climbed to 47.9 million
reais ($22.9 million) in the third quarter from 17.6 million
reais a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The dividend increase was reported today by the newspaper
Valor Economico, which cited Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Scavazza.  Anhanguera had gained 63 percent this year through
yesterday, almost three times the increase during the same
period in the small-cap index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
