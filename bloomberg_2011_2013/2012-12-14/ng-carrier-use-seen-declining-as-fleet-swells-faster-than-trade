Fleet usage for the 371 ships
carrying liquefied natural gas will slide in 2013 and 2014 from
a six-year high as demand growth slows and the supply of new
vessels expands,  DVB Bank SE (DVB)  said.  Ship yards will build LNG carriers with combined capacity
of 8.3 million cubic meters, or about 16 percent of the existing
fleet, during the next two years, the bank’s Rotterdam-based
research and strategic planning unit said in an e-mailed report
today. Liquefaction plants, which produce cargoes, will add
about 9.7 percent of additional capacity over the same period,
lowering vessel usage in both years, it said.  “Fleet growth remains a threat and is likely to impact
fleet utilization in a visible way post 2013,” DVB said in the
report. Vessel employment will remain “flat” and further
orders of new ships may also cut charter rates, it said. “We
notice a slight slowdown in demand growth.”  Rates rose to a record $150,000 in June as cargoes to Asia
from the Atlantic Ocean increased, according to data from
Fearnleys LNG, a unit of Oslo-based shipbroker Fearnleys A/S.
They subsequently slumped again before rebounding as the supply
of cargoes on the trade route fell and then increased. Costs for
the ships are at $115,000 daily for shipments to Asia, according
to Fearnleys.  Liquefaction capacity will expand to 329 million metric
tons by the end of 2014 from 300 million tons at the end of this
year, according to the report. The plants convert natural gas
into a liquid for transportation to terminals by chilling it to
minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 degrees Celsius).  Fleet utilization will drop to 89.5 percent next year and
to 87.7 percent in 2014 from 90.1 percent in 2012, DVB said.
Twenty ships will start trading next year and 32 in the
following 12 months, it said. Liquefaction capacity will rise to
as high as 470 million tons by 2018, the bank said.  Excess Capacity  “While the fleet is expected to grow further during the
next few years, it remains to be seen whether liquefaction
plants coming on stream are enough to absorb excess capacity as
we don’t expect a significant amount of vessels to be
scrapped,” DVB said. Prices for new ships may start increasing
once new liquefaction capacity is known as high-cost projects
are finalized, it said.  “Any increase in ordering activity from current levels
could easily derail the case for an increase in newbuilding
prices due to fleet overcapacity,” the bank said, adding
second-hand prices were expected to remain stable.  To contact the reporter on this story:
