The  Tour de France  will start in the
north England county of Yorkshire in 2014, organizers of
cycling’s top race said.  The race’s beginning, known as the “Grand Depart,” will
return to Britain for the first time in seven years when the
101st edition starts from Leeds. The 2007 Tour began in London.  “After an outstanding 2012 for British cycling, marked by
the historical victory of Bradley Wiggins on the Tour de  France ,
the United Kingdom will again hold pride of place in 2014,” a
statement from tour organizer Amaury Sports Organization today
read.  The race will move on to London before heading to France.
Full route details will be announced next month, ASO said.  Next year’s 100th edition of the Tour de France begins in
Corsica on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
