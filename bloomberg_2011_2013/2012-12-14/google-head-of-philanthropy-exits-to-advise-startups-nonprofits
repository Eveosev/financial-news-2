Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s head of philanthropy,
Shona Brown, is leaving after almost a decade at the company to
advise nonprofits and startups.  Brown will continue to serve as an informal adviser to
Google.org, the philanthropy arm of the operator of the most
popular search engine. Vice President Matthew Stepka will take
on the day-to-day leadership and Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will have a “more engaged role,” Brown  said in a blog
posting .  “While sad to leave, it has been a terrific ride,” Brown
wrote. “From our early days, Google has pledged to use
technology to tackle big problems, and we continue to deliver on
that promise today.”  Google is losing another high-level female executive after
 Marissa Mayer , who stepped down in July as vice president of
local, maps and location services to become chief executive
officer of rival  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  Brown arrived at Google in 2003 and
was senior vice president of business operations before taking
on the job at Google.org in 2011.  Mountain View , California-based Google fell less than 1
