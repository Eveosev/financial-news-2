Brazil sees the implementation of
Basel III regulations as a challenge, central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said.  Brazil will adopt an “adequate” schedule when putting
those regulations in place, he said at an  event  yesterday hosted
by banking federation Febraban in  Sao Paulo .  “We are certain that adoption in Brazil will be done
without disturbances,” Tombini said, adding that the central
bank created this week a unit aimed at overseeing financial
system conduct.  Some nations are struggling to meet a Jan. 1, 2013 deadline
for starting to apply the revised Basel III rules, which were
drawn up to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis that
followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Countries
have six years to phase in the changes.  Since August 2011, the administration of President  Dilma Rousseff  has reduced benchmark  interest rates  to record lows,
pressured banks to cut lending costs and increase borrowing and
lowered bank reserve requirements to jumpstart economic growth.
Brazil’s economy will grow 1.03 percent this year, the lowest
among major  emerging markets , according to the latest central
bank survey of about 100 economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
