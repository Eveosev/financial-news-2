An Azeri court imprisoned four
people for involvement in anti-government riots in the northern
district of Quba in March, the APA news service  said .  Quba residents Saxavat Fayizi, Xayyam Yunusov, Farhad
Abdurahmanov and Saxavat Alasgarov were given prison sentences
of four to six years, privately owned APA said today. Thirteen
others were handed suspended sentences.  Hundreds of people in Quba burnt and looted the local
governorâ€™s house and damaged his office on March 1 in a rare
outbreak of civil unrest in the energy-rich former Soviet
republic.  Quba, which has a population of about 160,000, is 164
kilometers (102 miles) north of the capital, Baku, near the
Azeri border with  Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
