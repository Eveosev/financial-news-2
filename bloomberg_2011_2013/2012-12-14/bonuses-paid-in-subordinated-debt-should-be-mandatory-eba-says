Senior bankers should be required to
receive some of their annual bonus in bonds that would suffer
losses during a financial crisis,  Europe ’s top banking regulator
said.  A “mandatory share” of bonuses for top management should
be paid in so-called bail-in bonds, which can be written down
when the lender’s capital dips below a safe level, the  European
Banking Authority  said in an opinion on proposals to separate
banks’ commercial and investment units.  “Such measures could be adopted in a swift manner and may
efficiently contribute to the overall efforts to reduce moral
hazard and restore confidence between the public and the banking
system,” the EBA said.  Michel Barnier , the European Union’s financial services
chief, has said that he’s weighing proposals made by an advisory
group led by European Central Bank Governing Council member
Erkki Liikanen. The measures, which would force lenders to set
up legally separate trading entities, are a “good basis” for
future EU policy making, Barnier has said.  The EBA said the commission should consider how splitting
up banks would affect their cost of funding, so as not to create
“unintended adverse consequences.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
