Iran ’s deputy chief nuclear
negotiator said his meeting with a European Union official that
aimed to establish common ground for another round of talks on
the country’s atomic program was “positive.”  Ali Baqheri said that during his July 24 meeting in
Istanbul with Helga Schmid, the EU foreign policy chief’s
deputy, “we managed to move forward with the talks within good
frameworks and reach agreements on continuation of the work and
future talks,” the official  Islamic Republic News Agency 
reported.  The talks will be followed by contact between EU foreign
policy chief  Catherine Ashton  and Saeed Jalili, Iran’s chief
negotiator, Ashton’s office said after the meeting, without
giving details.  Nuclear talks with Iran resumed in Istanbul in April after
an interval of more than a year. The last high-level discussions
involving members of the so-called P5+1 -- U.K., U.S., China,
Russia, France and Germany -- were held in Moscow in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
