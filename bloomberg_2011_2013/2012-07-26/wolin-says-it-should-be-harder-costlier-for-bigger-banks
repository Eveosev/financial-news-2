U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said it should be harder and costlier for banks to be
bigger.  “Dodd-Frank includes very very tough increases in capital
requirements, liquidity requirements, constraints on a whole set
of things that are about making sure we take care of and pay
attention to the size and scope,” Wolin said today on CNBC
television.  His comments come after Sanford “Sandy” Weill, whose
creation of Citigroup Inc. ushered in the era of U.S. banking
conglomerates, said it’s time to break up the largest banks to
avoid more bailouts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
