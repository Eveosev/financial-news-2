The loss of free-of-charge European
Union carbon permits next year will make an unspecified number
of  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s U.K. natural gas power stations unprofitable,
according to the utility.  “In power generation, conditions remain difficult for our
gas-fired power stations, and will worsen following the loss of
carbon allowances from 2013, which in the current market
conditions will render much of the U.K. gas-fired generation
fleet unprofitable,” Centrica said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire .  The EU will from 2013 stop granting carbon to most power
utilities, which have enjoyed mostly free-of-charge permits
since the program started in 2005. The bloc will instead sell
the allowances.  The average profit achievable by British gas-fired power
stations in the past year was 2.74 pounds ($4.25) a megawatt
hour, 48 percent less than the year-earlier period, according to
a so-called front-month spark-spread calculator that uses market
prices for gas, power and carbon.  “We have now taken the decision to close our Kings Lynn
power station, with the future of our Peterborough and Roosecote
plants under review,” Centrica said. Kings Lynn has a capacity
of 325 megawatts, Peterborough 360 megawatts and Roosecote 229
megawatts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Centrica is the biggest supplier of gas and electricity to
U.K. households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
