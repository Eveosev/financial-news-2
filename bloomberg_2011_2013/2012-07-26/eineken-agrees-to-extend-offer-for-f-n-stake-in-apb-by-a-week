Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-
biggest brewer, said it agreed to extend its offer for  Fraser
and Neave Ltd. (FNN) ’s stake in  Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)  by a week
from today.  Heineken, which offered S$50 a share for F&N’s holdings in
the Tiger beer maker, continues to believe the bid has
compelling value, it said in a statement today. F&N had
requested more time to consider the offer which will be extended
by one week from July 27, it said.  Heineken “is keen to agree a consensual deal with F&N,”
it said. “However, if HNV is denied the ability to extend its
offer to all APB shareholders it will review all options
available to protect its commercial interests.”  F&N said in a separate statement to the Singapore exchange
today that it has not received any other offers for its stake in
APB.  To contact the reporter on this story:
