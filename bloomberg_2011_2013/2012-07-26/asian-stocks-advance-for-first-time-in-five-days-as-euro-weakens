European stocks swung between gains
and losses as companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Unilever reported earnings. Commodities fell before U.S. durable
goods orders data, while Spanish bonds rose for a second day.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index was 0.2 percent lower at 10:08
a.m. in  London , and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slipped
0.4 percent. Oil slid 0.9 percent, copper dropped 0.9 percent
and the dollar strengthened against the euro. Spain’s two-year
note yield declined 20 basis points to 6.22 percent and the
Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-default swaps
on 15 governments fell 2.5 basis points to 278.  More than 40 members of the  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  reported results
today. Economists said reports will show U.S. orders for durable
goods rose 0.3 percent in June from 1.3 percent in May, and
sales of previously owned homes increased 0.3 percent in June
after climbing 5.9 percent in the previous month. Italy sold 2.5
billion euros ($3 billion) of zero-coupon debt due in May 2014.  “It is too early to re-visit any growth-centric trading
strategies,” said Kit Juckes, head of currency research at
Societe Generale SA in London. “I started the week hoping for
evidence that the global economy, having missed a beat in the
spring, was bottoming out. It was not to be.”  Company Earnings  Shell, Europe’s biggest oil company, dropped 3.8 percent in
London after reporting a bigger decline than projected in
second-quarter earnings. Siemens AG, the region’s largest
engineering company, slid 2.7 percent after saying its full-year
earnings goal has become harder to reach.  Unilever (UNA) , the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker,
rallied 5.2 percent in Amsterdam as sales growth beat analysts’
estimates. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, the world’s second-largest
maker of  aircraft engines , rose 4.9 percent as underlying pretax
profit topped forecasts.  The cost of insuring against default on corporate debt
declined for a second day, with the Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of credit-default swaps linked to 125 investment-grade companies
dropping 3.5 basis points to 175.75.  The retreat in the S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities was led
by a 1.2 percent decline in soybeans. Natural gas futures
extended yesterday’s drop, which was the biggest in two weeks.  Greek Exit  The euro slid 0.3 percent to $1.2125 after strengthening
0.8 percent yesterday. Citigroup Inc. estimated there is a 90
percent chance  Greece  will leave the euro within 18 months,
having previously given odds of 50 percent to 75 percent.  Italy’s two-year notes climbed, sending yields down 14
basis points to 4.81 percent, after today’s auction. Rates on
Germany’s 10-year bonds dropped three basis points to 1.23
percent, and yields on similar-maturity Treasuries were little
changed at 1.40 percent.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  added 0.2 percent, heading
for its first gain in five days. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index fell 0.5 percent as speculation the government will
maintain real-estate curbs overshadowed a State Council plan to
develop the nation’s central provinces.  Turkey’s  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  jumped 0.5 percent and the
lira weakened after the central bank said it may narrow its
rates corridor. Benchmark indexes fell 0.4 percent in  Russia  and
0.3 percent in  South Africa .  The  S&P 500  has declined for four straight days. More than
60 companies in the U.S. gauge are due to report results today,
