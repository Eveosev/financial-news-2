     July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Italy  sold 2.5 billion euros ($3
billion) of zero-coupon bonds, the maximum set for the
auction, and borrowing costs rose to the highest in eight months
amid concern  Spain  may need a full bailout as  Europe ’s debt
crisis worsens.  The Treasury sold the zero-coupon 2014 debt to yield 4.86
percent, the highest since November and up from 4.712 percent at
the previous auction on June 26. Investors bid for 1.78 times
the amount offered, compared with 1.65 times last month.  Italy’s 10-year  yield  was dropping two basis points to 6.43
percent at 11:13 a.m. Rome time, pushing the difference or
spread with similar-maturing German debt to 520.17 basis points.  Spain has agreed to a European bailout of its banks of as
much as 100 billion euros and the central government is now at
risk of being overburdened by the borrowing needs of cash-
strapped regional governments that are locked out of markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
