Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  jumped to
the highest level on record in New York after Globes newspaper
reported that  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  or  International Business Machines
Corp (IBM)  may buy the Israeli company for $6 billion.  Mellanox shares jumped 7.5 percent to $100.5 by 12:09 p.m.
in New York, the highest level since the company’s initial
public offering in 2007. The Tel Aviv shares of the Yokneam
Elit, Israel-based company closed 5.2 percent higher at 395.70
shekels, or the equivalent of $96.91.  Oracle or IBM may acquire the company for $150 per share,
Globes reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  “We see greater growth for the company remaining
independent,” Waldman wrote in an e-mailed message to Bloomberg
News.  Mellanox sees growth in the storage business and seeks to
use its technology to serve more markets and applications,
Waldman said in a Bloomberg Television interview. He said on
July 24 the company will use its cash reserves for more
acquisitions before rewarding shareholders with dividends and
stock buybacks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
