JSW Steel Ltd. (JSTL) ,  India ’s third-
biggest producer of the alloy, reported an unexpected 90 percent
drop in first-quarter profit following a currency loss. The
shares plunged.  Group net  income  slumped to 500 million rupees ($8.9
million) in the three months ended June 30 from 4.85 billion
rupees a year earlier, the Mumbai-based company said today in a
statement. The median profit estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 4.92 billion rupees. Sales climbed 45 percent to
107.8 billion rupees.  Indian steelmakers, including bigger rivals Tata Steel Ltd.
and Steel Authority of India Ltd., are expected to book currency
losses on overseas loans taken to purchase companies or coking
coal and factory equipment for expansion, said  Niraj Shah , an
analyst at Fortune Equity Brokers India Ltd. in Mumbai. The
rupee fell 8.6 percent in the three months ended June 30, the
worst performance among Asian currencies, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The group incurred a one-time foreign-exchange loss of 5.92
billion rupees, according to the statement. In June, JSW Steel
repaid $391.85 million of its zero-coupon foreign-currency bonds
issued in 2007. The company raised $225 million in overseas
loans and added $166.85 million from internal cash flows to make
the payment, it said in the statement.  Crude steel output at JSW’s biggest factory in the southern
state of Karnataka rose 27 percent to 2.1 million metric tons in
the last quarter from a year earlier.  Shares Fall  JSW Steel  shares  fell 3.9 percent to 643.75 rupees at the
close of trading in Mumbai. The stock has gained 27 percent this
year, compared with a 7.7 percent increase in the key Sensitive
Index.  The 10 million-ton-a-year factory in Karnataka operated at
about 80 percent of capacity, Chairman Sajjan Jindal told
reporters after the annual shareholders’ meet in Mumbai
yesterday. Iron ore mining is expected to restart in the state
by next month, following which the capacity use at the factory
may climb to 95 percent, he said.  The  Supreme Court  on April 20 asked 45 iron ore mines in
Karnataka to seek government approval to resume operations
before lifting a ban imposed in the state following
environmental violations. The court had halted mining in the
Bellary region in July last year and extended the ban to two
other districts the next month, cutting ore supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
