Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, said the estimated cost of
building a mine in the Andes may jump to about $8 billion
because the project is more complex than it had anticipated.  Pascua-Lama, located at an elevation of 3,800 to 5,200
meters (12,468 to 17,061 feet) on the border between Chile and
 Argentina , will cost about 50 percent to 60 percent more than
top end of a previously estimated range of $4.7 billion to $5
billion, Toronto-based Barrick said today in a statement.
Initial output is now expected in mid-2014 instead of mid-2013.  Barrick Chief Executive Officer Jamie Sokalsky is revising
costs and reviewing the company’s other development projects
after taking over last month from Aaron Regent, who was fired.
Barrick raised Pascua-Lama’s cost estimate by $1.4 billion a
year ago. The latest increase is “outrageous” and suggests “a
lack of controls,” said  George Topping , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Toronto.  “You have to question at what point did they know about
this and whether they actually should be proceeding with it at
this point,” Topping, who recommends buying the shares, said
today in a telephone interview.  Barrick  dropped  4.2 percent to C$33.04 at the close in
Toronto. The shares have declined 28 percent this year.  Projects Reviewed  “Based on information gathered to date, it is apparent
that the challenges of building a project of this scale and
complexity were greater than we anticipated,” Barrick said in
the statement.  Barrick said “various pipeline projects” aren’t viable
amid current economic conditions. It said the Cerro Casale
project in  Chile  and Donlin Gold in  Alaska  don’t currently meet
the company’s investment criteria.  “Rate of return should drive production, not the other way
around,” Sokalsky said in the statement.  The company is targeting more than 8 million ounces of
output in 2015, compared with a previous estimate of 9 million
ounces in 2016.  Second-quarter profit  trailed analysts’ estimates after
production fell and costs rose more than expected. Net income
fell 35 percent to $750 million, or 75 cents a share, from $1.16
billion, or $1.16, a year earlier.  Profit excluding one-time items was 78 cents a share,
missing the 93-cent average of 22  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales declined to $3.28 billion from $3.42 billion.  Copper Forecast  Gold production dropped to 1.74 million ounces from 1.98
million ounces a year earlier. Stephen Walker, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets  in Toronto, estimated output at 1.84 million
ounces while Stifel Nicolaus’s Topping predicted 1.78 million
ounces.  Barrick’s so-called total cash costs rose 38 percent to
$613 an ounce from $445 a year earlier. Topping estimated $564.  Gold futures averaged $1,613 on the Comex in  New York  in
the quarter, 7 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices have
posted 11 consecutive annual gains.  Barrick reaffirmed its gold production forecast for this
year of 7.3 million to 7.8 million ounces. Copper production
will be 460 million to 500 million pounds, compared with an
earlier forecast of 550 million to 600 million, because of lower
output at the Lumwana mine in  Zambia .  The company raised its forecast for 2012 gold cash costs to
$550 to $575 per ounce, from $520 to $560.  To contact the reporter on this story:
