Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which is fighting
Eastman Kodak Co. over ownership of patents, lost a bid to
transfer a Kodak lawsuit against the iPhone-maker out of
 bankruptcy court .  U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan today
denied Apple’s request to move the lawsuit to his court from the
bankruptcy court overseeing Kodak’s restructuring.  Daniels said Apple’s transfer request could be reconsidered
after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper rules on Kodak’s
request for an order blocking Apple’s ownership claims to 10
patents. Gropper heard arguments on the issue earlier this week.  Kodak and Apple are grappling over patents that are
included in a portfolio Kodak is set to auction next month as
part of its bankruptcy case. Kodak sued Apple in June in
bankruptcy court, seeking to block Apple’s ownership claims to
the assets.  Apple argued in court papers that the bankruptcy court
doesn’t have the authority or “necessary expertise” to decide
the dispute. Kodak opposed withdrawal of the case.  Jeremy Fielding, a Kodak spokesman, said the Rochester, New
York-based company was pleased by today’s decision. Paul Basta,
an attorney for Cupertino, California-based Apple, declined to
comment after the court hearing.  The Apple lawsuit is  Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  v. Apple Inc.,
12-01720,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
