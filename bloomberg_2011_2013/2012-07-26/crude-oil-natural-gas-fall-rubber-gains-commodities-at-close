$88.35 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile

gold yesterday, the least since January 9, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The so-called ratio was at 0.8748 today.  BASE METALS  Copper dropped for the first time in three days as concern
 Europe ’s debt crisis may worsen while growth in  China  slows,

additional steps to boost growth.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  declined on speculation that rain in the U.S.
