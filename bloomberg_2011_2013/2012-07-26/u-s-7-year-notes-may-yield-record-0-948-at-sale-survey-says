The Treasury Department’s $29
billion sale of seven-year notes may draw a record low  yield  of
0.948 percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 10 of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in July 2019, yielded 0.938
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. Last month’s seven-year note sale drew a record low yield
of 1.075 percent.  The size of today’s offering is the same as at the past 24
sales of the maturity after peaking at $32 billion from November
2009 through April 2010.  The June 28 offering’s  bid-to-cover ratio , which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.64, down from 2.8 in May. The average for the past 10 auctions
is 2.83.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks,  bought  42 percent of the notes at the
June sale after purchasing 42.7 percent in May. The average for
the past 10 offerings is 39.7 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 6.5 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 14.1
percent at the past 10.  Yearly Returns  Seven-year notes have returned 4.5 percent this year,
compared with a 3.2 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-
year securities returned 13.7 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall gained 9.8 percent.  Today’s offering is the third of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion of
two-year notes on July 24 at a record low yield of 0.22 percent
and the same amount of five-year notes yesterday at a record low
yield of 0.584 percent.  This week’s note offerings, combined with the July 19
auction of $15 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities, will raise $60.6 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $53.4 billion.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
