  Richard Greenfield , an analyst who
covers  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , downgraded the maker of social games and 
apologized for overestimating earnings after the company reported 
revenue and profit that missed projections.  In a note titled “We Are Sorry and Embarrassed by Our
Mistake,” the BTIG LLC analyst downgraded Zynga to neutral from
buy after the company showed it’s making less money from
individual users than he expected, Bloomberg.com’s Tech Blog
reported.  “We firmly believed that the small fraction of Zynga users
who pay was increasing and that monetization per user was
improving,” Greenfield said in a note yesterday. “Paying
players on Facebook are clearly paying less due to the mix of
games.”  He added, “Our confidence in Zynga management
diminished.”  Zynga, the biggest developer of games played on  Facebook
Inc. (FB) , fell short of analysts’ second-quarter revenue and profit
estimates as the company competes with a growing number of apps
on the social network and mobile devices. Sales were $332.5
million, less than analysts’ average estimate of $343.1 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit excluding some
items was 1 cent a share, less than the 6-cent estimate.  Zynga, based in San Francisco, makes money by selling
virtual goods within its games -- a gun in “Mafia Wars” or a
tractor in “FarmVille.” Greenfield revised his earnings
projection for the full year to 7 cents, down from 31 cents. The
new estimate would represent a 70 percent drop from last year.  A jump in monthly unique players was driven primarily by
“Draw Something,” a mobile game Zynga acquired earlier this
year for $200 million that doesn’t generate much revenue,
Greenfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
