Germany’s economy is increasingly
reliant on domestic consumption to grow as its debt-plagued
export partners in the euro-area roll back orders, the  DIW 
institute said in a review of the economic outlook.  Europe’s largest economy may grow 0.3 percent in the third
quarter following expansion of about 0.2 percent in the previous
three months, the Berlin-based unit said in an e-mail sent to
news organizations today. The economy “can’t avoid switching
down gears amid weak developments in the  euro zone ,” with
exports “clearly feeling” the crisis, it said.  Rising wages and unemployment at a two-decade low have
helped shield Germany’s economy from the euro-area fiscal
crisis. While German business confidence fell for a third month
in July, consumer confidence will climb to a five-month high in
August,  GfK SE (GFK)  said today. German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler has said that the economy would rely “entirely” on
domestic demand for growth in the second half.  Siemens AG (SIE) , Europe’s largest engineering company, said
today that reaching its full-year earnings goal has become
harder after reporting fiscal third-quarter profit and sales
that fell short of analysts’ estimates. “The deceleration of
the world economy has increased in the past few months,” Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  said.  The Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden will  publish 
second-quarter economic growth figures on Aug. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
