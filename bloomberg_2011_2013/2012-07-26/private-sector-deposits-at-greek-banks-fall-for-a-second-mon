Private-sector deposits at Greek
banks declined for a second month in June, European Central Bank
data show.  Deposits by non-financial companies and households fell
6.89 billion euros ($8.36 billion), or 4.2 percent, to 156.2
billion euros after dropping 8.39 billion euros in May,
according to  ECB data  released today.  Greece  has been struggling to stand by obligations tied to
its rescue, and European officials have voiced the once-taboo
possibility that the country may leave the 17-member currency
union. The government is clamoring for more help as Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras on July 22 compared his country’s
economy after five years of contraction to the Great Depression
of the 1930s.  Deposits from companies and households in Greek banks were
down 38.9 billion euros from June 2011, today’s data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
