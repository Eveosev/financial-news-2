Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.
is the “best possible” buyer of the London Metal Exchange,
according to Stefan Boel, a member of copper producer  Aurubis
AG (NDA) ’s board.  LME shareholders yesterday approved a $2.2 billion takeover
bid from the Asian bourse. Aurubis said in March it had no
interest in selling its 24,000 LME shares. Boel, who declined to
disclose how Hamburg-based Aurubis voted, spoke in a phone
interview yesterday.  “We were against the sale of the LME, but not particularly
against Hong Kong Exchanges. Hong Kong had the best cards in
their hands, and they were the best possible acquirer from the
industry point of view if the LME were to be sold.  “Hong Kong Exchanges was interested in the LME as it is.
It didn’t want to change the LME.  “Hong Kong Exchanges gave assurances that the new LME will
continue like the old LME did on many points until January 2015.
They’ve taken a note of our criticism and our worries.  “We look forward to good discussions with them. It’s
important for them to know companies like us and how we operate
and make use of the LME.  “We are a shareholder, but our shareholding is less
important than our use of the LME. That’s why we have been so
much emphasizing the need for the LME to maintain the elements
of the current business model.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
