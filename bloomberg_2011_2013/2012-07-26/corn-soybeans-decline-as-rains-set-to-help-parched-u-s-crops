Corn and soybeans dropped on
speculation rains in parts of the Midwest may help crops in the
largest U.S. producing region that’s been hit by the worst
drought in at least a generation.  Corn for December delivery lost as much as 1.1 percent to
$7.7975 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading
at $7.8075 at 11:14 a.m. Singapore time. Soybeans for November
delivery declined as much as 2.1 percent to $15.8175 a bushel,
before trading at $15.8325.  The  National Weather Service  said flood advisories were in
force in  North Dakota  and  Minnesota , which were hit by drought.
Rain may also fall across a much larger area including Iowa and
Illinois, said Joel Widenor, of Commodity Weather Group LLC.
Iowa and Illinois are the two largest corn and soybean growers.  The “improved weather forecast has been a contributing
factor to the weakness in grain prices over the past few days,”
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , said by phone from Sydney today. “We don’t believe
the rain is a game changer. We still expect significant cuts in
corn yield prospects compared to the USDA’s July estimate,” he
said, referring to the supply and demand report by the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  that’s set for Aug. 10.  Wheat for September delivery lost as much as 2.2 percent to
$8.8375 a bushel in Chicago, before trading at $8.8575. Futures
jumped 41 percent since June 15.  Jordan extended the deadline for bids in a tender to buy
100,000 metric tons of wheat to July 31 from July 25, according
to three traders with direct knowledge of the situation.  “The debate continues whether current prices are high
enough for demand rationing,” Mathews said in a report today.
“For Jordan at least, prices are too high.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
