Zambia’s inflation rate fell to 6.2
percent in July from 6.7 percent a month earlier, John Kalumbi,
director for the Lusaka-based Central Statistics Office, told
reporters in the city today.  The southern African nation recorded a 113.6 billion kwacha
($23 million)  trade surplus  in June, a 59 percent decline on the
previous month’s figure, he said.  July inflation was the slowest since it fell to 6 percent
February, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lower corn-
meal prices would probably help reduce inflation in July, the
Bank of Zambia said a month ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
