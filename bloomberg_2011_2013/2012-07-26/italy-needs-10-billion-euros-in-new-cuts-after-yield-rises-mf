Italy may need to pass new budget
cuts worth as much as 10 billion euros ($12.1 billion) this year
after debt-financing costs rose more than forecast,  MF  reported,
citing an estimate by the general accountant.  The projection was submitted earlier this month to Prime
Minister  Mario Monti , MF said. The premier decided to wait until
after a meeting of the  European Central Bank  next month before
considering additional austerity measures, the Milan-based
newspaper said.  Monti said July 20 that Italy is on track to meet its
budget goals and doesnâ€™t need further budget adjustments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
