  Janus Capital Group Inc. (JNS) , owner of
the Janus, Intech and Perkins funds, said second-quarter profit
fell 44 percent after clients withdrew money for the 12th
straight quarter and markets declined.  Net income decreased to $23.4 million, or 13 cents a share,
from $41.9 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, the Denver-
based company said today in a statement. Excluding certain
items, analysts had expected earnings of 14 cents a share,
according to the average of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “Janus is heavily skewed toward equity retail mutual funds
and retail investors continue to avoid those types of
products,”  Michael Kim , an analyst with Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP in  New York , said in an interview before results
were announced.  Chief Executive Officer Richard M. Weil, a former executive
at Pacific Investment Management Co., has struggled to hold onto
clients amid poor fund performance and falling equity markets.
Clients pulled $4 billion from the firm in the quarter, and
market losses dragged assets down by $7.6 billion as the MSCI
ACWI Index of global stocks declined 6.4 percent.  Janus fell 2.6 percent to close at $6.80 in New York
trading. The  shares  have gained 7.8 percent this year, compared
with the 4.7 percent gain by the Standard & Poor’s 20-company
index of asset managers and custody banks.  Janus’s withdrawals included $2 billion from Janus-branded
products, $2.5 billion from its quantitative investing unit
Intech and $500 million from its Perkins unit, which specializes
in stocks seen as undervalued.  Bond Funds  Janus’ fixed-income products, a line-up Weil has worked to
expand, attracted $1.1 billion in deposits. Bond-focused
products account for about 11 percent of Janus’s assets.  The amount of money Janus invests for clients declined 10
percent to $152.4 billion from a year earlier helping to lower
revenue by 22 percent to $206 million. Assets fell by 7.1
percent in the quarter.  Lower marketing expenses and falling compensation costs,
linked to poorer performance, helped expenses decline by 16
percent to $153.9 million.  The company has also suffered from a policy that adjusts
fees lower or higher based on fund performance over trailing
periods of 12 to 36 months. That reduced earnings by $21.9
million in the quarter.  Janus’s funds probably lost money in the quarter from
investments in  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) , the largest developer of games on
Facebook Inc.’s social network. Janus nearly doubled its
holdings in Zynga in the three months ended June 30 as the game
maker lost more than half its stock value.  Zynga fell as much as 40 percent today in early trading
after missing analysts’ second-quarter revenue and profit
estimates.  Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) , the Atlanta-based manager of the Invesco,  Van
Kampen  and PowerShares funds, said today second-quarter net
income fell 16 percent to $153.9 million, or 34 cents a share,
from $183 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier after investors
withdrew $8.3 billion in the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
