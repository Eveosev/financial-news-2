Hungary’s former Prime Minister
 Gordon Bajnai  is planning a return to politics in the autumn,
 Heti Valasz  said, without saying how it got the information.  Bajnai wants to unite the opposition against Prime Minister
Viktor Orban, excluding his predecessor, former Premier Ferenc Gyurcsany, according to the Budapest-based magazine. The
Socialist Party, the green party Lehet Mas a Politika and the
out-of-parliament Szolidaritas movement would be included in
Bajnai’s coalition, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
