Apple Inc. (AAPL)  won’t immediately have to
publish a notice on its U.K. website that Samsung Electronics
Co. didn’t copy its iPad tablet, a London court ruled today.  Apple was ordered earlier this month to put a note on its
U.K. site and buy advertisements in British newspapers to alert
customers to a court ruling that Samsung hadn’t copied the
iPad’s design. Cupertino, California-based Apple appealed saying
it didn’t want to advertise for its rival. The order is stayed
until its appeal against the ruling is heard in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
