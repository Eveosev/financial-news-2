New York  conventional gasoline
strengthened after production of the grade by refiners in the
region declined.  Conventional gasoline  production  by refiners and blenders
on the East Coast dropped 13,000 barrels on a four-week average
to 1.74 million barrels a day, the Energy Department reported
yesterday. It was the lowest level for the period since May.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor narrowed 1.62 cents to 14.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:53
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 4.84 cents to $2.6838 a gallon.  Production  of reformulated fuel by refiners and blenders on
the East Coast rose 5,000 barrels to 1.22 million barrels a day
on a four-week average basis, government data showed.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York narrowed 0.75 cent to 4.13 cents a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  rose 2 cents to a premium
to futures of 1.75 cents a gallon. It’s the highest level since
July 13.  Flint Hills Resources LLC’s Corpus Christi,  Texas , refinery
halted production on its alkylation unit, Katie Stavinoha, a
Houston-based spokeswoman for the company, said in an e-mail
yesterday. She declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
