German coalition lawmakers  Frank Schaeffler  and Klaus-Peter Willsch, who’ve voted against
measures to bail out cash-strapped euro-region nations,
criticized European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s
announcement that the bank will do whatever is needed to
preserve the euro, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported.  Schaeffler, a Free Democrat, said Draghi is pillaging
German savings as his policies will boost inflation, according
to the newspaper. Willsch, a budget-committee member from
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union, said
rising prices for houses, farmland, gold, coins and classic cars
in Germany reflect a flight to tangible assets as a precursor to
accelerating inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
