MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , a pay-
as-you-go wireless carrier, advanced the most since its initial
public offering more than five years ago after reporting
quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates amid a decrease
in promotional costs.  MetroPCS  surged  37 percent to $8.59 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest intraday gain since its IPO in April 2007.
The shares had declined 28 percent this year through yesterday.
 Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) , a rival pay-as-you-go
wireless-service provider, jumped 12 percent to $5.64.  Second-quarter net income rose 76 percent to $148.8
million, or 41 cents a share, from $84.3 million, or 23 cents, a
year earlier, the Richardson, Texas-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts projected 22 cents, the average of
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  MetroPCS, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Roger Linquist, is cutting sales-promotion costs amid a slowdown in
new customers. The company shed 186,000 users in the quarter,
its first quarterly customer lost, compared with a gain of
199,000 users a year ago.  Jennifer Fritzsche , an analyst at Well Fargo Securities,
projected a loss of 174,000 customers in the quarter.  Phil Cusick , an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., called for a loss of
250,000 users.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization was $477 million, better than the $363 million
estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 6 percent to $1.28
billion, beating the average of analysts’  estimates  of $1.25
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
