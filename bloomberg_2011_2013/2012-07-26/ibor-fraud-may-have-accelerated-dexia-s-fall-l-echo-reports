The rigging of Libor may have
accelerated the collapse of  Dexia SA (DEXB) , the Belgian lender that
sought a government rescue last year and is now being broken up,
 L’Echo reported , citing people familiar with the matter without
naming them.  The bank may have been forced to raise an extra 600 million
euros ($729 million) for collateral on swap transactions because
of the effect of the fraud in lowering official interbank
lending rates, according to the newspaper.  Dexia, which had taken out the swap contracts to protect
itself in case Libor increased, was hit by collateral calls from
counterparty banks when the rate instead fell, L’Echo said.
These counterparties included Barclays Plc, which has been fined
290 million pounds ($449 million) for its role in manipulating
Libor.  The swap contracts in general accounted for half of the 90
billion euros in aid that Dexia was forced to seek last year,  Le
Soir  reported, without indicating where it got the information.  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark  interest rate  for more
than $500 trillion of securities, has been shaken by Barclays
admission that it submitted false rates. The revelations have
provoked renewed calls for tougher oversight of the financial
system and pushed regulatory probes of interbank lending rates
to the top of the political agenda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
