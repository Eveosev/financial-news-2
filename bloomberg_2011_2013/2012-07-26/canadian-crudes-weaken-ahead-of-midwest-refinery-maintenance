Canadian oils weakened ahead of
planned refinery maintenance later this year that will curb
demand for the grades.  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting refinery in  Indiana  will shut a crude unit
and several compressors next month for six to eight weeks of
work, a person with knowledge of operations said July 10.
Marathon Petroleum Corp. will shut its Detroit refinery for
maintenance by Sept. 6, a person with direct knowledge of the
plans said March 1.  Syncrude weakened $6.50 to a discount of $3.50 versus West
Texas Intermediate at 12:08 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from
tar-like bitumen in  Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $1 to $20 below
WTI. Bakken oil’s discount to WTI weakened $1 to $4 a barrel.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, sweet oil premiums narrowed against
WTI. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark
slipped 75 cents to $15.75 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
premium to WTI lost $1 to $16.50.  Poseidon’s premium added 80 cents to $10.05 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon rose 50 cents to $9.50 over WTI. Mars
Blend increased 80 cents to $11.05 a barrel over the U.S.
benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
increased $1.45 a barrel to $12.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
