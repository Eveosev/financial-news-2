Nationwide Building Society , the
U.K.’s biggest customer-owned lender, said it will refund any
costs incurred by customers wrongly charged twice for purchases
made on credit cards this week.  “Human error” was to blame for the glitch, which caused
transactions made on July 24 to be duplicated the following day,
the Swindon, England-based firm said in a  statement  today.
Customers who incurred charges will be compensated, the company
said.  Nationwide, which has about five million checking accounts,
is the second major U.K. lender to experience technical problems
with customers’ accounts in the last two months after a computer
error at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc left some of its 15
million customers unable to access their money in June.  “We would like to apologize for the inconvenience this has
caused and we can assure customers that should they incur any
related charges these will be refunded in full,” Nationwide
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
