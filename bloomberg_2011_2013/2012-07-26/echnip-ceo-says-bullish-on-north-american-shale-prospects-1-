Technip SA (TEC) , Europe’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, is “bullish” about the prospects
for development in  North America  because of the shale-energy
boom, Chief Executive Officer Thierry Pilenko said.  The company sees future business in liquefied natural gas
export terminals, gas to liquids development and petrochemicals
and fertilizer plants, Pilenko said on a conference call today.  “Our perspective on the activities is pretty bullish,”
and the company has reinforced teams and technology in the
region, he said.  U.S. energy companies are developing vast reserves of
natural gas, helping the nation meet 81 percent of its energy
demand in 2011, the most since 1992, according to U.S. Energy
Department data. Natural-gas prices have slumped 29 percent in
the past 12 months because of shale development, lowering the
costs of feedstock for the petrochemicals industry and raising
the chances that the U.S. could approve LNG exports that would
require new terminal infrastructure, Pilenko said.  Technip, which is based in Paris, is spending 225 million
euros ($276 million) on  Shaw Group Inc. (SHAW) ’s Stone & Webster
process technologies and oil and gas businesses, gaining 1,200
engineers and researchers.  Earnings Report  Technip reported steady second-quarter profit and said it
hasn’t yet seen the effects of lower oil prices on demand. Net
income rose to 134.2 million euros from 132.5 million euros a
year earlier. Sales gained 23 percent to 2.05 billion euros.  The company, which maintained financial targets for 2012,
had a record order backlog of 12.7 billion euros at the end of
the second quarter, compared with 9.41 billion euros at the same
time last year, it said in a statement. Brent-crude futures, a
benchmark oil price used by much of the world, fell 7 percent
from a year earlier to average $108.76 a barrel.  Development of oil projects in West Africa could be
announced in the next 12 to 18 months including in  Angola ’s
Block 32 and in  Nigeria , Equitorial Guinea and  Ghana , Pilenko
said. Future projects in  Mozambique  could require a
“significant amount of subsea work,” he said.  Technip raised its forecast for spending to more than 400
million euros this year compared with 357 million euros in 2011.
That level may remain for a “little longer” and could include
increasing capacity at its Asiaflex Products pipe plant in
 Malaysia , Chief Financial Officer Julian Waldron said.  Technip confirmed full-year financial targets published
Feb. 16. It’s seeking revenue of 7.65 billion to 8 billion euros
in 2012, with a subsea operating margin of about 15 percent and
a margin for onshore-offshore of 6 percent to 7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
