Treasuries declined for a second day
after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the ECB
was ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro, damping
demand for the safety of U.S. assets.  U.S. government debt extended losses after reports showed
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments fell and
durable goods orders climbed more than forecast. Longer
maturities led losses on concern a slide in U.S. yields to
record lows this week will erode demand as investors prepared to
bid at a $29 billion sale of seven-year debt today.  “It’s a buy-the-dip opportunity on Treasuries,” said
Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of government and
agency debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a fixed-income
broker and dealer for institutional investors. “We’re waiting
to see some real concrete measures from the ECB -- we need firm
action. The fact that we’re off today can only help the seven-
year.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.43 percent at 11:29 a.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent note maturing in May 2022 fell 9/32, or $2.81 per $1,000
face amount, to 102 29/32. The yield dropped to a record 1.379
percent yesterday.  The 30-year  yield  climbed three basis points to 2.49
percent after declining to 2.4405 percent, the lowest level
since Bloomberg started tracking the securities in 1977.  Note Auctions  The U.S. seven-year notes being sold today yielded 0.95
percent in pre-auction trading, poised to draw a rate less than
1 percent for the first time. Investors  bid  for 2.64 times the
amount offered at the previous sale on June 28, the least since
October.  “There won’t be a problem digesting the supply,” said
Milstein.  Seven-year notes have returned 1.5 percent this month,
the same as that for the broader Treasury market, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s note offering was the third of three this week  The Treasury sold $35 billion in two-year debt July 24 at
an all-time auction low yield of 0.220 percent, drawing almost
record demand. It followed that yesterday with the sale of $35
billion in five-year notes, at a yield of 0.584 percent, also a
record. The Treasury will sell a total of $99 billion in debt
this week.  Ten-year yields will rise to 1.86 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies with the
most recent projections given the heaviest weightings.  ‘Our Mandate’  “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro,” Draghi said during a speech in
 London  today. “And believe me, it will be enough.”  His comments came as Spanish policy makers call on the ECB
to do more to fight a renewed bout of financial turmoil that
pushed the yields on the country’s bonds to the highest level in
the euro era this week.  “Draghi’s comments are contributing to the risk-on trade”
said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New York at
Jefferies Group Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that trades with
the  Federal Reserve  “It’s putting in support for perhaps
resuming buying peripheral debt.”  The euro jumped against the dollar by the most in almost a
month, climbing as much as 1.4 percent.  Treasuries extended losses after applications for  jobless
benefits  decreased by 35,000 in the week ended July 21 to
353,000, Labor Department figures showed today, extending the
period of volatility typically seen in July. Economists forecast
380,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  ‘Bounce Around’  “The claims trend is probably going to bounce around in
the 370-to-390 range for a considerable period,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies
Group Inc., a primary dealer.  Orders for U.S. durable goods climbed 1.6 percent for a
second month, another report showed. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 0.3 percent
gain.  Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields dropped to a record
yesterday as signs of a global economic slowdown boosted demand
for the relative safety of  U.S. government debt .  The term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed
that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and
inflation, dropped to negative 1.02 percent on July 24, the most
expensive level on record. It was minus 0.98 today. A negative
reading indicates investors are willing to accept yields below
what’s considered fair value.  Fed Buying  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold 30-year Treasuries
instead of 10-year notes shrank to 1.04 percentage points today
from this year’s high of 1.23 percentage points set in May. The
average over the past decade is 0.7 percentage point.  The U.S. central bank purchased $1.8 billion of Treasuries
due from February 2036 to May 2042 today as part of the central
bank’s plan, known as Operation Twist, to put downward pressure
on borrowing costs by swapping short-term Treasuries in its
holdings for longer maturities.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt
from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of so-called quantitative
easing, seeking to cap borrowing costs. Policy makers next meet
on July 31 and Aug. 1. They have kept  interest rates  in a range
between zero and 0.25 percent since December 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
