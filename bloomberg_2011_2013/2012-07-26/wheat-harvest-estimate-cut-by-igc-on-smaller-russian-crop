World corn production will fall 0.7
percent after crop conditions deteriorated in the U.S., the
International Grains Council forecast, reversing its outlook for
the harvest to climb to a record.  Farmers across the world will harvest 863.5 million metric
tons of corn in the 2012-13 crop year, 53.7 million tons less
than forecast on July 2, the London-based council wrote in an e-
mailed report today. The crop is expected to slip from 869.9
million tons in 2011-12.  Corn futures have jumped 55 percent on the Chicago Board of
Trade since mid-June as drought wilted crops in the U.S., the
world’s largest grower, and Ukraine. Surging grain costs will
lift food prices globally in July, according to the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization.  “ Severe drought  in the U.S. has lowered expectations for a
replenished supply this fall and driven commodity futures prices
to record levels,”  Alberto Weisser , the chief executive officer
of commodity trader  Bunge Ltd. (BG) , said in an earnings report
today. “Large crops next spring from farmers in  South America 
will help provide relief to a stressed market.”  U.S. farmers are expected to reap 300 million tons of corn,
50 million tons less than predicted at the start of the month
and below the 313.9 million tons harvested in 2011, the grains
council said.  “The 2012-13 outlook for maize production has generally
worsened, especially in the U.S., where high temperatures and
severe drought have reduced prospects,” the council wrote,
using another name for corn.  U.S. Corn  About 26 percent of the U.S. corn crop was in good or
excellent condition as of July 22, down from 31 percent a week
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported this week.  The outlook for Ukraine’s corn harvest was reduced to 21
million tons from 24 million tons previously, and compared with
last year’s production of 22.8 million tons, the report showed.  World wheat production is seen at 664.6 million tons,
500,000 tons less than an earlier estimate and compared with a
harvest of 695.9 million tons in 2011-12, the council said.  The outlook for Russia’s wheat harvest was cut to 45
million tons from 49 million tons at the start of the month and
down from 56.2 million tons in 2011-12. Kazakhstan will harvest
12 million tons this year compared with 22.7 million tons last
year, according to the council, which cut its July 2 forecast by
3 million tons.  China, India  Forecasts were raised for wheat production in  China  and
 India . The Chinese crop is estimated at 120 million tons, 3
million tons higher than previously expected, while the outlook
for India was lifted 3.9 million tons to 93.9 million, according
to the council.  World wheat stocks at the end of June 2013 may be 183
million tons, up from 182 million tons forecast previously, the
council said. Corn stocks may fall to 115 million tons from 129
million tons a year earlier. The council had previously forecast
stocks would climb to 137 million tons.  Global soybean production is forecast to climb 9 percent to
259 million tons, as output recovers in  Latin America , the
council wrote.  China’s grain imports may fall to 9.1 million tons from 9.9
million tons in 2011-12, compared with a previous outlook for
the country’s purchases to climb to 12.1 million tons.  The council cut its outlook for grain exports by the U.S.,
 Russia , Ukraine and Kazakhstan, while raising forecasts for
shipments from Brazil,  Canada ,  Australia  and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
