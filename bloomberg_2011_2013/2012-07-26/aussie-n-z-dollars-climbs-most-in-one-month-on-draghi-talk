The Australian and New Zealand
dollars gained the most this month against the greenback after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers
will preserve the euro, fueling risk appetite.  The Australian dollar and its New Zealand peer, nicknamed
the kiwi, rose as investors bet officials may intervene in bond
markets to contain rising borrowing costs in Europe. Stocks and
commodities rose.  “The kiwi is up considerably against the dollar today and
against most of its counterparts benefitting from the general
risk-on mood,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in Washington
at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of Western Union
Co., said in a telephone interview.  Australia’s dollar appreciated as much as 1.1 percent to
$1.0402 yesterday in New York before closing at $1.0397, up 0.9
percent. The Aussie rose 0.9 percent to 81.32 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, strengthened as
much as 1.8 percent, the biggest intraday jump since June 29, to
80.30 U.S. cents before closing at 80.19 cents, up 1.6 percent.
It climbed 1.7 percent to 62.72 yen.  Stocks across the world rallied. The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  rose as
much as 1.9 percent, the most in almost a month. The  MSCI Asia
Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 0.8 percent, snapping a four-day losing
streak.  Draghi spoke yesterday at the Global Investment Conference
in London, saying surging sovereign-bond yields may fall within
the ECB’s jurisdiction.  Spanish 10-year yields have reached a euro-era record of
7.75 percent, exceeding the 7 percent level that prompted
bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Yields on the Spanish
10-year bonds declined to 6.93 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
