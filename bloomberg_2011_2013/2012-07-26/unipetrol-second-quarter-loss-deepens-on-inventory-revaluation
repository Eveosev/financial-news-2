Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the  Czech Republic ’s
largest refiner, said losses deepened in the second-quarter on
inventory revaluations and a weak economy.  Net loss in the three months through June came to 598
million koruna ($28.5 million) compared with a 1 million koruna
loss a year earlier, Unipetrol said in an e-mailed statement. It
was wider that the 361 million koruna loss reported in the first
quarter 2012.  Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax came to a
loss of 437 million koruna, compared with a 224 million koruna
profit a year earlier, the company said. Revenue rose 4.5
percent to 27.1 billion koruna, according to the statement.  “The results were influenced mainly by significant
negative inventory revaluation losses and ongoing rather weak
external macroeconomic environment,” the Prague-based company
said in the statement. “We increased the company’s revenue
mainly due to higher sales volumes of fuels and other refinery
products.”  Unipetrol was forced to revalue its inventories because of
lower prices of crude oil. Earnings before interest and tax in
the refinery segment came to a 359 million koruna loss while
Ebit in the petrochemical segment reached a loss of 80 million
koruna in the second quarter, the company said.  “The results are below our expectations and we see them as
negative,”  Milan Vanicek , Prague-based head of research at J&T
Banka AS wrote in an e-mailed note today.  Unipetrol is controlled by Polish refiner PKN Orlen SA,
which posted an unexpected second-quarter net loss of 5.24
million zloty ($1.52 million) today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
