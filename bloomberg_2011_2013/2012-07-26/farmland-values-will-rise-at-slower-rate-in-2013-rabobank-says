U.S. farmland values will increase
at a slower rate in the first half of 2013 because of the
“dramatic” gains in 2012 and “looming macroeconomic
worries,” according to a Rabobank International report.  Land values jumped in late 2011 and early in 2012, gaining
more than projected by the bank, Sterling Liddell, a vice
president of Rabobank’s food and agribusiness research and
advisory, said today in an e-mailed  statement . High commodity
prices, low  interest rates , rising rental rates and strong
relative returns in agriculture signal that U.S. farmland will
continue to be “an attractive investment,” said Liddell, who
authored the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
