Queensland,  Australia ’s third-most
populous state, will seek to freeze bonuses paid to employees of
the government-owned rail network operator after service
reliability fell to a three-year low.  Queensland Rail  paid as many as 1,337 bonuses worth a total
of A$4.8 million ($5 million) in the 2011 financial year,
Transport and Main Roads Minister Scott Emerson said in a e-
mailed statement today. Extra payments will only be made when
they are required by contracts, he said.  Liberal National Party leader  Campbell Newman  won office in
March, ending Labor’s 14 years in power, with promises to cut
spending and restore the state’s AAA credit rating. Queensland’s
worsening financial performance is a concern that may hurt its
Aa1 rating and greater budgetary efforts are needed, Moody’s
Investors Service said in its annual report on the Australian
state in February.  “A$4.8 million is not an acceptable level, particularly
when there is declining patronage and reliability reached a
three-year low,” Emerson said. “I think most people would take
a dim view of bonuses at a time when we are making hard
decisions.”  The bonus decision followed the state government’s order
last month for Queensland Rail to refocus its business on the
delivery of “frontline” service, the minister said.  In the past two years, the rail operator has increased
staff levels in communication and marketing by 68 percent while
strategy and corporate services has expanded its workers by 66
percent, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
