Assurant Inc. (AIZ)  said earnings from
residential coverage that borrowers must buy when they miss
payments on their initial policies will slip as the firm
introduces a new insurance product amid regulatory reviews.  “The changes, and ultimately a more normal housing market,
will mean that our lender-placed revenues will decline, and so
too will our profits in this business,” Chief Executive Officer
Robert Pollock said today on a conference call with analysts.
“The returns, though lower than recent years, will continue to
be attractive.”  Assurant has submitted information about the new lender-
placed insurance offering to  New York  regulators, who had
questioned the pricing of its coverage. It has also filed fresh
rates with California regulators. The insurer has met with
 Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  and will present its views at an
August meeting of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, Pollock said.  New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent
 Benjamin Lawsky  is examining whether insurers profit excessively
from the policies.  “We are working with regulators to introduce a next-
generation lender-placed product, to address some of the
unanticipated issues that have developed during the housing
crisis,” Pollock said.  Premiums on the coverage may vary by location based on the
chance a natural disaster will destroy the property, and
deductibles can change based on considerations including the
amount of coverage, he said.  Editors: Dan Kraut, Peter Eichenbaum  To contact the reporter on this story:
