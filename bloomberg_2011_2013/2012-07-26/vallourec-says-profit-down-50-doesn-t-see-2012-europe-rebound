Vallourec SA (VK) , a French producer of
steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, reported a 50 percent
decline in second-quarter profit.  Net income dropped to 56.6 million euros ($70 million) from
112.1 million euros a year earlier, the  Boulogne Billancourt ,
France-based company said today in a statement. Sales increased
by 3 percent to 1.33 billion euros, Vallourec said.  While oil and gas industries have improved, other markets
have deteriorated, particularly industrial business in Europe
and  Brazil , and are unlikely to rebound this year, it said.  “For the rest of the year we expect the robust performance
in oil & gas markets to continue to have a favorable impact on
our mix,” Vallourec said in the statement. “Other markets will
continue to be affected by the weak economic environment.”  The company maintained its estimate for the margin on
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in
2012 of close to 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
