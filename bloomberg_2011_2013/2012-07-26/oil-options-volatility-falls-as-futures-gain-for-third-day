Oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures gained after the president of the  European
Central Bank  said policy makers will defend the European
currency and the euro rallied against the dollar.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 31.12 percent at 3:25 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 31.8 yesterday. It was
the third consecutive decline.  Crude oil for September delivery rose 42 cents to settle at
$89.39 a barrel on the Nymex, the third straight gain. The
dollar declined as much as 1.4 percent against the euro in  New
York , increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers will do
whatever is needed to preserve the euro, suggesting they may
intervene in bond markets as surging yields in Spain and  Italy 
threaten the existence of the 17-nation currency bloc.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $83 puts, which fell 15 cents to 65 cents a barrel at
3:44 p.m. with 1,871 lots trading. September $80 puts were the
second-most active options, with 1,790 lots changing hands as
they declined 8 cents to 30 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 54 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 52
percent of the 105,213 contracts traded.  September $100 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday, with 7,212 lots changing hands. They fell 3 cents to
26 cents a barrel. September $85 puts declined 28 cents to $1.26
on volume of 5,089.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,642
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,753 lots and
December $120 calls with 38,583.  To contact the reporter on this story:
