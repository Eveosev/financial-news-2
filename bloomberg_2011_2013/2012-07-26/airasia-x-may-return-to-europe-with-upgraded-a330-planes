AirAsia X Sdn., the long-haul arm of
 Asia’s biggest  discount carrier, said a planned order for Airbus
SAS’s revamped A330 may let it revive European routes that were
unsuccessful with older planes.  “ Europe  would be much more accessible” with the new
aircraft, Chief Executive Officer Azran Osman Rani said in an
interview in Sydney yesterday. He declined to say how many A330s
the Malaysian carrier will order or when European flights could
resume.  The new A330 may be profitable on European services because
of its better  fuel efficiency  and greater capacity, Azran said.
The budget carrier ended services to the continent earlier this
year because of fuel costs, slowing demand and the introduction
of a carbon-emissions levy.  Airbus announced plans to update the twin-engine A330
earlier this month to help compete with Boeing’s 787 and 777
aircraft. The new plane, due to enter service in 2015, will use
technologies from the A350 to increase its range and capacity.  AirAsia X, which is focusing services on  Asia  and
 Australia , also plans to sell a stake of about 25 percent to 30
percent in an initial public offering, Azran said. AirAsia Bhd.
and other existing shareholders’ stakes will be diluted in the
sale, he said.  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  has no plans to sell its entire 18.5
percent holding, he said.  The timing of the offering will depend on the appetite in
the Malaysian share market, where several large IPOs are
expected, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
