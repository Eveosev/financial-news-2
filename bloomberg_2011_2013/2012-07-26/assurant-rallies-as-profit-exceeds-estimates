Assurant Inc. (AIZ) , the insurer of
foreclosed homes, jumped the most since November in  New York 
trading after second-quarter earnings beat analysts’ estimates.  The insurer climbed 4.8 percent to $34.92 at 9:49 a.m. in
New York trading. It’s fallen 15 percent this year.  Operating profit at the New York-based firm was $1.81 per
share, exceeding the highest estimate among 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Earnings jumped as results improved at Assurant’s
specialty-property and health coverage businesses, the company
said in a statement late yesterday.  “Core results were well ahead of our estimates,”  John Nadel , an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., wrote in a
research note yesterday. “Capital management accelerated and
capital flexibility remains strong.”  Operating income at the specialty-property unit, which
insures homes when borrowers lapse on policy payments, more than
doubled to $92.3 million in the second quarter from $42.3
million a year earlier. The health division’s operating income
jumped to $28.9 million from $5.2 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
