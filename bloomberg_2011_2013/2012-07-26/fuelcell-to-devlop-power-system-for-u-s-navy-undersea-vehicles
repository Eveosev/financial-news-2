FuelCell Energy Inc. (FCEL)  said it won a
$3.8 million order from the U.S. Navy to develop and test a
hybrid solid-oxide fuel cell battery power system for use on
unmanned undersea vehicles.  The goal of the 18-month project is to engineer and build a
propulsion system that can run on stored liquid fuel for 70 days
with no emissions, Danbury,  Connecticut  based FuelCell said in a
statement today.  FuelCell may get as much as $20 million for later phases of
the Navy  project  after construction and testing is completed,
Kurt Goddard, a spokesman, said in an interview.  FuelCell rose 3.9 percent to $1.06 a share at the close in
New York. The stock has increased 22 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
