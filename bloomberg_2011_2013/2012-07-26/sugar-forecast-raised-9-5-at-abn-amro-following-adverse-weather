Raw sugar’s average price this year
will be 9.5 percent higher than previously forecast because of
adverse weather in producing nations,  ABN Amro  Bank NV said.  The sweetener will average 23 cents a pound, against its
prior forecast of 21 cents, the bank said today in a report. In
May it had predicted pressure on prices because of expected
production surpluses, particularly in India.  Sugar output in Brazil’s main producing area slid 31
percent in June’s second half as wet weather delayed harvesting,
industry group  Unica  said this month. The South American country
is the world’s largest producer and India ranks second.  “Prices could remain elevated, because the unseasonable
rains in Brazil, heavy rains in Australia and a delayed start of
the Indian monsoon all affect the 2012-13 harvest,” Hans van
Cleef, an analyst at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, wrote in the report.
 Australia  is the third-biggest global sugar exporter.  Higher production in  Russia , Europe,  Thailand  and China and
elevated existing supplies helped to compensate for lower output
elsewhere, the bank said.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 2 percent to 23.11
cents a pound by 6:58 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Prices have averaged 22.63 cents this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The sweetener is up 10 percent this month
and touched a 16-week high of 24 cents on July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
