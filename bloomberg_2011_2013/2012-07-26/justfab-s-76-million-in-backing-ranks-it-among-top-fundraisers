JustFab, a subscription-based
Internet retailer, raised $76 million in new financing, joining
the top ranks of retailing venture-capital fundraisers this year
behind Pinterest Inc. and Fab.com Inc.  Rho Ventures LLC led the funding and Mark Leschly, a
partner at the New York-based firm, will join the board, JustFab
said today in a statement. Matrix Partners, Technology Crossover
Ventures and Intelligent Beauty Inc., JustFab’s parent company,
also joined the round, bringing the total amount raised to date
to $139 million.  JustFab’s funding puts it in sixth place among retail and
e-commerce venture-capital deals this year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The company said it will use the funds to
broaden overseas business, including through acquisitions.  “The main purpose of this round of financing is to
continue our international expansion,” Adam Goldenberg, co-
chief executive officer of JustFab, said in an interview. “On
the acquisition front, this round is bigger than what we need,
so we’re going to have excess cash on the balance sheet.
Companies that could help us with that expansion are intriguing
targets.”  JustFab, which has Kimora Lee Simmons as its president and
creative director, designs and sells its own brand of shoes,
jewelry and handbags, and charges subscribers a flat $39.95 for
each item. The company, which already has an online store in
 Germany , plans to open in the U.K. in September and
“aggressively” invest in building a user base in the rest of
Western Europe, Goldenberg said.  Fashion Funding  The financing comes on the heels of a $105 million round
raised earlier this month by Fab.com, an online marketplace for
well-designed products, such as tableware and jewelry made from
skateboards.  JustFab’s $76 million in funding ranks it among the biggest
fundraisers this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The list
includes Fab.com, which raised $105 million, and Pinterest,
which raised $100 million.  JustFab’s customers take a style quiz and receive
personalized product recommendations tailored to their tastes.
The company’s 6 million subscribers have to visit the site at
least once a month to maintain membership and don’t have to
commit to making a purchase, Goldenberg said.  “It’s all about engagement,” he said. “We want to train
the customer to come back and shop with us every month. We
believe that ultimately, we’re going to show them what they
want, and that they’re going to spend a significant amount of
their wallet share for fashion with us.”  JustFab and Fab.com each plan to reach $100 million in
revenue this year, their respective CEOs have said.  Supply Chain  JustFab is adding about 500,000 subscribers a month and
expects to be profitable in the U.S. by 2013. Goldenberg said
he’s able to sell merchandise at a higher margin than stores
such as Forever 21 Inc. and  Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB)  -- or H&M --
whose styles JustFab seeks to emulate.  The company saves money by taking greater control of the
supply chain by hiring staff to design products made by Asian
manufacturing partners and shipping directly to consumers from
the company’s warehouse in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Intelligent Beauty Inc., JustFab’s parent, logged $400
million in revenue last year from its three properties --
JustFab, DermStore.com LLC, which sells beauty products, and
Sensa Products LLC, a weight-loss company. Goldenberg and Don Ressler are co-chief executive officers of both JustFab and
Intelligent Beauty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
