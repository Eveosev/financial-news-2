Mark Boucher, the South African
cricket player whose eye was injured in a game on July 9, will
undergo surgery in the next three to six months in a bid to
improve his vision, his doctor, Peter Sandell, said in a
statement e-mailed by Cricket South Africa today.  Boucher’s medical team are “cautiously optimistic that he
will have a reasonable recovery of the vision in his left eye,”
Samdell said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
