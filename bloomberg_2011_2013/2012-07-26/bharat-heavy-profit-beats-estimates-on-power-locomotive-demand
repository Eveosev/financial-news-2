Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) ,
India’s biggest maker of power-plant equipment, said first-
quarter profit rose a better-than-expected 13 percent as demand
gained for electricity and locomotives.  Net income climbed to 9.2 billion rupees ($165 million) in
the three months ended June 30 from 8.16 billion rupees a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The median
profit of 34 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey was 8.2
billion rupees. Sales gained 18 percent to 87.4 billion rupees.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  plans to spend as much as
$300 billion in the five years to March 2017 to boost generation
capacity and reduce blackouts to revive economic growth from the
slowest pace in three years.  Indian Railways , Asia’s oldest
network, plans to borrow 150 billion rupees ($3 billion) next
year as it adds more trains and replaces old coaches and wagons,
then Rail Minister Dinesh Trivedi said in May.  Orders reached 1.33 trillion rupees at the end of the
quarter, New Delhi-based Bharat Heavy said in the statement.
India’s cabinet last week revised the duty structure on imported
power equipment, levying a combined 21 percent duty on purchases
from overseas, according to CNBC TV18 news channel. The decision
is expected to help Bharat Heavy regain market share from
Chinese suppliers, including  Shanghai Electric Group Co. (601727)  and
Dongfang Electric Corp.  The  shares  rose as much as 1.5 percent to 219.45 rupees and
traded at 217.90 rupees as of 1:37 p.m. in Mumbai. The stock has
declined 8.8 percent this year, compared with an 8.8 percent
gain in the benchmark Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
