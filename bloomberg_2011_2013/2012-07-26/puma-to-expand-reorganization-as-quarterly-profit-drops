Puma SE (PUM) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
sporting-goods maker, said it will accelerate a reorganization
after second-quarter profit fell 29 percent.  Net income dropped to 26.7 million euros ($32.4 million)
from 37.6 million euros a year earlier, the Herzogenaurach,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. Sales rose 12
percent to 752.9 million euros.  The company reduced its forecast for net sales growth to a
“mid-single-digit” percentage from an earlier prediction of a
high single-digit gain. The extended reorganization program,
intended to “reduce complexity,” will result in as much as 100
million euros in one-time costs, Puma said.  The manufacturer will combine national units into seven
regional groupings in Europe to share back-office functions, it
said. The program will eventually be expanded  worldwide , Puma
said.  The company appointed Michael Laemmermann as chief
financial officer as of Jan. 1, 2013, as Chief Operating Officer
Klaus Bauer, whose duties included finance, is leaving, Puma
said. A new chief operating officer will be appointed later, it
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
