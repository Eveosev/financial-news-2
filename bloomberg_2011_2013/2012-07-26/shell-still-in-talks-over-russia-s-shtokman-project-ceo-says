Royal Dutch Shell Plc is still in
talks with OAO Gazprom about joining the Shtokman liquefied
natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, one of the world’s
biggest gas deposits.  “We now have interest in doing more LNG projects in
 Russia ,” Shell Chief Executive Officer  Peter Voser  told
Bloomberg Television today. “Discussions are ongoing. I can’t
comment on any more details.”  Shell and Gazprom are already partners in the 9.6 million
metric-ton-a-year Sakhalin-2 LNG plant on Sakhalin Island, off
Russia’s far eastern coast.  Russian media have said Shell may replace Norway’s Statoil
ASA in the Shtokman development. The field, about 400 miles
northeast of Murmansk in the  Barents Sea , may hold 3.8 trillion
cubic meters of the fuel, according to Gazprom.  Gazprom owns 51 percent of Shtokman Development AG, Statoil
24 percent and France’s Total SA has 25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
