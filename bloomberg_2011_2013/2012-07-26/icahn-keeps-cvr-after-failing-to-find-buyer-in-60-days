Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn , who
took over  CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  after saying the refiner would reap
better returns for shareholders by selling itself, failed to
find a buyer for the company after a 60-day process.  After contacting more than 30 potential bidders, “CVR
received one indication of interest, which CVR and Jefferies did
not believe to be credible,” according to a company statement
released today. Jefferies & Co. was hired by CVR to conduct the
sale process, which ended on July 23.  Icahn  gained control  of the  Sugar Land , Texas-based oil
refiner in May over the opposition of its management by offering
$30 a share and the right to an additional payment if he sells
the company by Aug. 18, 2013. He had criticized CVR for not
seeking a buyer and said it was “too small and not diversified
enough to compete,” according to a March 28 statement.  CVR owns refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma capable of
processing a combined 185,000 barrels a day. The company also
controls  CVR Partners LP (UAN) , a fertilizer maker.  Icahn won’t continue to seek a buyer because “continual
shopping of CVR could be disruptive to its operations,” the
company said in the statement.  “The gap between his expectations and market reality may
be unbridgeable,” Neil Earnest, a Dallas-based practice leader
for mergers and acquisitions at energy consultant Muse, Stancil
& Co., said in a phone interview before the announcement.  CVR  rose  0.4 percent to $27.77 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 25 percent since Icahn’s initial stake
was announced Jan. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
