Triple jumper Phillips Idowu’s
participation in the London games is in doubt after Britain’s
national Olympic committee said he’s yet to provide medical
records explaining why he pulled out of a training camp.  Idowu, who’s scheduled to take part in his fourth Olympics,
must provide the records as part of team protocol. The 33-year-
old last competed at a meet in Eugene,  Oregon , on June 2, where
he hurt his foot.  Idowu, the silver medalist at the 2008 Beijing games,
said he’d prefer to rehabilitate in the U.K. rather than travel
with the rest of Team GB to  Portugal .  “We’re still waiting to receive the medical records from
Phillips’s team but we expect to receive those shortly,” Andy Hunt, chief executive office of the British Olympic Association,
told reporters today. “We ultimately do have the right, as you
know, to make an assessment on fitness, indeed any grounds
around selection or de-selection.”  Idowu’s agent  Jonathan Marks  didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment. The athlete, who also was world
champion in 2009, said he was “surprised and disappointed”
that the  BOA  publicly requested his medical records, according
to a statement earlier this week.  There isn’t a deadline for Idowu to submit his medical
records, the BOA said. Team GB doesn’t have a replacement triple
jumper, Hunt said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
