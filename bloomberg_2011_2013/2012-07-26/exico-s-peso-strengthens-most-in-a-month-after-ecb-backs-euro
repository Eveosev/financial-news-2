Mexico ’s peso jumped the most in one
month after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
policy makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro,
spurring a surge in higher-yielding assets.  The peso climbed 1.4 percent to 13.4138 per dollar at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, bringing its rally this year to 3.9
percent, the biggest among the most-traded currencies against
the dollar tracked by Bloomberg. The peso posted its biggest
one-day advance since June 29.  Emerging-market currencies rallied as Draghi’s comments
fueled speculation that the ECB may be getting ready to
introduce new measures to tame the region’s debt crisis. Spanish
politicians have called on the central bank to do more after
yields on the country’s bonds soared to euro-era records this
week.  Draghi’s comments “caught markets pretty much in a classic
short squeeze,”  Win Thin , global head of emerging-market
strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., said in a telephone
interview from  New York . “Everyone was short risk this week.”  Speculation that the European crisis would hurt Mexican
exports helped make the peso  Latin America ’s worst-performing
major currency in 2011.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.29 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.49
centavo to 142.77 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
