Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc (IBTCCB) , a unit of
 Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , rose to a three-month high after
announcing higher profit and plans to cancel four-fifths of
shares as it restructures into a holding company.  The stock gained a third day, climbing as much as 3.6
percent to 7.44 naira and closed at 7.20 naira in Lagos, the
highest price since April 20.  Second-quarter net income climbed to 4.99 billion naira
($31 million) from 3.85 billion naira a year earlier, the Lagos-
based lender said in a statement published on the website of the
Nigerian Stock Exchange dated July 25. Stanbic shareholders will
receive 50 kobo for each cancelled share, it said in a statement
published in the Lagos-based BusinessDay newspaper today.  “The result and restructuring announcements are positive
and are helping the stock to rise,” Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based
analyst with Vetiva Capital Management, said by phone today. The
profit is in line with Vetiva’s expectations, he said.  Stanbic shares have retreated 13 percent this year,
compared with a 12 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange 
All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
