European stocks  climbed the most in
almost a month, halting a four-day selloff, after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers will do
whatever it takes to preserve the euro.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  surged 11 percent and UniCredit SpA
jumped 9.2 percent, leading a rally in bank stocks.  Unilever (UNA) 
rose 5.4 percent to the highest price in more than 20 years
after sales beat analyst estimates.  France Telecom (FTE)  SA added 6.4
percent after it also reported results that topped projections.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  jumped 2.5 percent to 256.58 at
the close of trading, for its biggest gain since June 29. The
gauge had dropped 4.4 percent the previous four sessions as a
surge in Spanish bond yields above 7 percent reignited concern
that Europe’s debt crisis is yet to be contained.  “Policy makers don’t want the euro to break up and
ultimately will take the necessary decisions to ensure that it
keeps together,” said Kevin Lilley, a  fund manager  at Old
Mutual Asset Managers U.K. in London, which oversees about 4
billion pounds ($6.2 billion). “ Spain  really needs bond yields
below 5 percent for the economy to be sustainable -- policy
action has to follow.”  Stocks surged after Draghi signaled central bank officials
are prepared to do whatever is needed to ensure the euro’s
survival and act on surging bond yields. His comments came as
Spanish policy makers called on the central bank to fight a
renewed bout of financial turmoil that pushed the country’s bond
yields to euro-area records this week.  “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro,” Draghi said during a speech in
London today. “And believe me, it will be enough.”  Bonds Advance  Spanish and Italian bonds advanced for a second day.
Spain’s  two-year yields  fell the most this month after Draghi
said addressing high yields on sovereign debt was within the
central bank’s mandate. German bunds declined as his comments
damped demand for the region’s safest assets.  National benchmark indexes rose in 16 of the 18 western-
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 1.4 percent,
 France ’s CAC 40 jumped 4.1 percent and Germany’s DAX climbed 2.8
percent. Spain’s IBEX 35 jumped 6.1 percent, while Italy’s FTSE
MIB surged 5.6 percent.  In the U.S., a report from the Commerce Department showed
orders for durable goods climbed 1.6 percent in June. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.3
percent gain.  Fewer Americans than forecast filed first-time claims for
 jobless benefits  last week, extending the period of volatility
typically seen in July. Applications fell by 35,000 in the week
ended July 21 to 353,000, the Labor Department said today.
Economists forecast 380,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Banks Gain  Santander, which today reported a 93 percent slump in
second-quarter profit, jumped 11 percent to 4.51 euros.  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria , Spain’s largest bank, climbed 11
percent to 4.91 euros.  UniCredit (UCG) , Italy’s biggest lender, surged
9.2 percent to 2.58 euros in Milan.  Unilever rose 5.4 percent to 2,256 pence, the highest level
since at least September 1988, after the world’s second-biggest
consumer-goods maker announced a 5.8 percent gain in underlying
revenue in the second quarter, boosted by the growth of
personal-care products in  Asia . The average analyst estimate
surveyed by the company was for a 4.8 percent increase.  France Telecom  France Telecom  climbed 6.4 percent to 10.93 euros after the
country’s largest phone company reported a 3.2 percent decline
in first-half revenue to 21.8 billion euros as price cuts helped
slow customer defections. That compares with the 21.7 billion-
euro average analyst estimate.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  gained 5.2 percent to 16.61 Swiss francs after the
maker of power-transmission equipment said it’s more confident
about its short-term outlook as orders increased in China in
recent months and it experienced “sustained order growth” in
the U.S. Net income for the second quarter still fell 27 percent
to $656 million, missing analyst estimates.  Telefonica SA (TEF)  rallied 3.4 percent to 8.95 euros. The shares
had tumbled as much as 8.7 percent after Europe’s biggest phone
company suspended its 1.50 euro-a-share dividend for 2012 and
reduced a revenue forecast.  Alcatel-Lucent (ALU)  sank 6.1 percent to 82.2 euro cents after
France’s largest network-equipment supplier said it will cut
5,000 jobs as part of a plan to save an additional 750 million
euros. The company’s net loss, its first in five quarters, was
254 million euros compared with net income of 43 million euros a
year earlier.  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  slid 2 percent to 5.96 euros. Europe’s
second-largest automaker was lowered to two levels below
investment grade by all three main rating services after the it
posted a widening loss at its automotive division yesterday.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  slid 2.3 percent to 2,138 pence as
Europe’s biggest oil company today reported a 13 percent drop in
second-quarter profit, excluding one-time items and inventory
changes, to $5.7 billion. That missed the average analyst
estimate of $6.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
