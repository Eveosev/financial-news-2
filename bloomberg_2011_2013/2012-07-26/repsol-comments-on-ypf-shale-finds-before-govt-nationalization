YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Argentina â€™s largest energy
company, discovered a shale oil reservoir in Santa Cruz province
and a shale gas discovery before the government nationalized the
company, according to former controller Repsol SA.  YPF found shale oil after drilling two wells in the D129
area in Santa Cruz province, Kristian Rix, a spokesman for
Repsol said today in a telephone interview from Madrid. The
company also discovered shale gas reserves in the Vaca Muerta
block, he said.  Before Argentina seized control of YPF by taking a 51
percent stake from Repsol in April, YPF planned to announce the
shale oil discoveries, Rix said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
