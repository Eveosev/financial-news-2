OAO Aeroflot,  Russia â€™s biggest
carrier, reported first-half profit that fell 66 percent, based
on preliminary figures.  Preliminary net income was 2.3 billion rubles ($71
million), according to Russian accounting standards, the Moscow-
based air carrier said today in a statement. The company posted
a profit of 6.7 billion rubles in the first half of 2011.  The carrier said cost-cutting enabled it to avoid the 1.4
billion-ruble loss it previously expected.  To contact the reporter on this story:
