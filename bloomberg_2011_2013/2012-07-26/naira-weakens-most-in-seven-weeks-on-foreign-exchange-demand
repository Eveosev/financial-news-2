The naira depreciated the most in
seven weeks on higher demand for dollars from foreign exchange
bureaus and importers.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer declined 0.8
percent to 160.95 per dollar as of 1:37 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its biggest decline on a closing basis since
June 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is accumulated demand by exchange bureaus, which
are channelled at interbank market, besides demand from other
importers, both factors are weakening the naira,” Abubakar
Muhammed, chief executive of Lagos-based Forward Marketing
Bureau de Change Ltd., said by phone today. Fuel imports have
been a source of pressure on the naira, according to the  Central
Bank of Nigeria .  The central bank said on July 9 it cut the amount of weekly
dollar sales to each bureau de change to $50,000 from $75,000
previously. The Abuja-based bank said July 24 it reduced the
amount of foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of
their shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and kept
its  interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent. The amount of cash as
a percentage of deposits that commercial banks must hold with
the central bank was increased to 12 percent from 8 percent,
Governor Lamido Sanusi said.  Inflation accelerated to 12.9 percent in June, from 12.7
percent in May, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics
said July 18. The country’s foreign-currency reserves have
fallen by $1.3 billion since the end of May to $36.4 billion,
according to July 24 data compiled by the central bank.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s seven-year domestic bonds due June
2019 rose 36 basis points to 16.49 percent, according to July 25
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021
declined by eight basis points to 5.397 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9575 per dollar
in Accra, the capital, the lowest since at least 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
