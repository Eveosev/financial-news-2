LG Display Co. (034220) , the world’s second-
largest maker of flat-screen panels, plans to spend 1.2 trillion
won ($1 billion) to boost production of screens for mobile
devices as demand shifts from televisions to smaller gadgets.  Investment will start this month and will be completed by
the end of 2013, the Seoul-based company said in a statement
today. LG Display will convert part of its liquid-crystal-
display production capacity to a line making advanced mid-to-
small sized displays, it said. Mass production is slated to
begin in the fourth quarter of 2013.  LCD makers are struggling to boost profit as global TV
sales slump. The supplier to Apple Inc. may today report a 32
billion won second-quarter loss, according to the average of 27
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Affiliate  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570)  said yesterday it had a 41.7 billion-won loss
from its 38 percent stake in LG Display.  Global TV shipments fell for the first time since 2004 last
year, according to DisplaySearch, part of the NPD Group.
Worldwide TV shipments fell about 8 percent in the first quarter
as sales of LCD models dropped on an annual basis for the first
time, the research company said on June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
