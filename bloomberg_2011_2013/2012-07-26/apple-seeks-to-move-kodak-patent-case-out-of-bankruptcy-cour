Apple Inc., which is fighting
 Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ)  over ownership of patents, argued a federal
judge should transfer a Kodak lawsuit against the iPhone-maker
out of  bankruptcy court .  Apple told U.S. District Judge George Daniels at a court
hearing today in Manhattan that Kodak’s complaint over patent
ownership should be considered in federal district court.  Kodak and Apple are grappling over 10 patents that are
included in a portfolio of patents Kodak is planning to sell as
part of its bankruptcy restructuring. Kodak sued Apple in June
in bankruptcy court, seeking an order that Apple doesn’t own the
assets.  Apple argued in court papers that the bankruptcy court
doesn’t have the authority or “necessary expertise” to decide
the dispute. Kodak opposes withdrawal of the case.  The hearing is continuing.  The Apple lawsuit is Eastman Kodak Co. v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , 12-
01720, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
