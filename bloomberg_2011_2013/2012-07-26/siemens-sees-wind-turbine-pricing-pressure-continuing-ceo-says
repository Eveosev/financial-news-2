The pricing pressure in the wind
turbine industry will continue because of overcapacities,
 Siemens AG (SIE)  Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher  said.  “We continue to see capacity adjustments, overcapacity”
and therefore continued pricing pressure in the renewables
business, Loescher said today during a call with analysts.  Siemens, which today said profit from its renewable
business declined 48 percent to 36 million euros ($44 million)
in the third quarter, sees “no deterioration but also no reason
to believe that we’re seeing a positive development” in that
industry, Loescher said.  Western turbine makers including Siemens, General Electric
Corp. and Denmark’s  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  are suffering from
increased competition from Asia. Siemens’ new renewable orders
declined 68 percent to 525 million euros.  Vestas is cutting a 10th of its workers as its market share
slips away to China’s  Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558)  and  Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (2208)   To contact the reporters on this story:
