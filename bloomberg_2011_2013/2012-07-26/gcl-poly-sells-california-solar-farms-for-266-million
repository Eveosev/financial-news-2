GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the
worldâ€™s biggest maker of  polysilicon , sold a solar-power
development unit to an unidentified U.S. buyer for $266 million.  GCL-Poly expects to record a $16 million (HK$124 million)
pretax gain on the sale, which closed yesterday, the Hong Kong-
based company said today in a statement.  The development unit is building two solar farms in
California that have total capacity of 92 megawatts and are
expected to be complete this year. The buyer is a New York-based
renewable-energy developer, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
