Vestas Wind System A/S won an order
to supply 24 megawatts of turbines to Ireland’s state-owned
utility, Bord Gais Eireann, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company
said today in a statement on its website.  Vestas will supply 12 V90 2-megawatt turbines to extend an
existing wind farm in Lisheen, Ireland that already has 18
turbines, the company said. The turbines will be delivered in
the first quarter of next year to the project, whose main
contractor is an Irish unit of  Balfour Beatty Plc. (BBY)   To contact the reporter on this story:
