PVI Holdings (PVI) ,  Vietnam ’s second-
largest insurer by market value, climbed the most in a week
after saying it completed the sale of a 6.8 percent stake to
Talanx AG.  The shares rose 1.2 percent to 16,600 dong as of the close
on the Hanoi Stock Exchange, the biggest advance since July 19.
The benchmark VN Index gained 0.5 percent.  Hanoi-based PVI sold the stake for 560 billion dong ($27
million), it said in an e-mailed statement today. Talanx,
 Germany ’s third-biggest insurer, now owns 31.8 percent of the
Vietnamese company.  The stake will be held by HDI-Gerling Industrie
Versicherung AG, a unit of Talanx, according to the statement.
PVI will use the funds to capitalize a new life-insurance
subsidiary and to strengthen the capital base of other units.  HDI-Gerling will be able to nominate three members of the
board of directors and two members of PVI’s supervisory board,
according to the statement.  Talanx bought an initial stake in PVI in August for 1.9
trillion dong to get a foothold in the Southeast Asian nation’s
growing non-life insurance market.  PVI shares have dropped 9.8 percent this year, compared
with the benchmark index’s 18 percent gain.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
