Iranian ministers held a meeting
with lawmakers yesterday to review the economy and discuss ways
to minimize the impact of sanctions,  Shargh  reported.  Parliament Speaker  Ali Larijani  said the three branches of
the government will form a committee to address economic issues,
the Tehran-based newspaper said. He also asked the government of
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  to halt new construction projects and direct
funds toward supporting domestic production.  Iranâ€™s economy, oil and agriculture ministers and the
central bank governor were among those attending the meeting,
Shargh said. Lawmakers are scheduled to meet with Ahmadinejad on
July 29 to discuss efforts to combat sanctions and inflation, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
