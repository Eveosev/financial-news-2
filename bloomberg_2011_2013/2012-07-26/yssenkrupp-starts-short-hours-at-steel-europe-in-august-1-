ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe AG said
today it will introduce shortened shifts from August due to
“ongoing weak orders.”  ThyssenKrupp and its workers council agreed on the measure,
which will affect production sites in Duisburg-Hamborn,
Duisburg-Huettenheim, Bochum, Dortmund and the Siegerland area,
the Essen, Germany-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Shortened shifts are expected to remain in place until the
end of the year, it said. About 12 percent of 17,500 workers
will be affected.  Stefan Ettwig, a company spokesman, declined to quantify
the amount of production that will be lost.  The shares rose 2.4 to 14.15 euros at the close in
 Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
