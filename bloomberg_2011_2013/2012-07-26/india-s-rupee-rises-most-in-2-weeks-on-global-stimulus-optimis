     July 26 (Bloomberg) -- India ’s rupee rose the most in almost
two weeks on speculation central banks in the world’s largest
economies will take more steps to support growth, bolstering
demand for higher-yielding assets.  The currency climbed to the highest level in almost a week
after  European Central Bank  President  Mario Draghi  signaled
officials are prepared to do whatever is needed to preserve the
euro. Foreign investors added $10.2 billion to  holdings  of
Indian shares this year, compared with outflows of $512 million
in 2011, exchange data show.  Asia ’s third-largest economy
expanded 5.3 percent in the first three months of the year,
faster than  Brazil ’s 0.75 percent and  Russia ’s 4.9 percent.  “Capital inflows will be better this year than last as
India is still one of the world’s relatively fast growing
economies,” said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi
Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, we are unlikely to
see an avalanche of funds as capital preservation is more
important for investors than generous returns, considering the
external environment is quite bad.”  The rupee advanced 1.2 percent to 55.5150 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest jump since July 13, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 55.5125 earlier, the strongest
level since July 20. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, decreased 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 11.70 percent.  Policy makers from the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European
Central Bank and the  Bank of England  all meet next week, before
the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis in August.
Citigroup Inc. estimated, before Draghi’s comments, that there
is a 90 percent chance  Greece  will exit the euro within 18
months, having previously given odds of 50 percent to 75
percent.  Rate Outlook  The rupee will be supported as the highest yields among
major Asian economies will attract global funds, according to
Anand Rathi. The government’s 10-year bonds  yield  669 basis
points more than comparable U.S. Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will keep its benchmark
 repurchase rate  unchanged at 8 percent at a review on July 31,
according to 27 of 28 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. One
predicts a 25 basis point cut. Central bank Governor Duvvuri
Subbarao said on July 16 that  inflation , which measured 7.25
percent last month, is “way above” the monetary authority’s
threshold of around 5 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.75 per
dollar, compared with 57.18 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.74 from 57.21. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
