Turkey ’s central bank reduced its
estimate for  inflation  this year to 6.2 percent from 6.5
percent, saying the rate may be lower than the forecast and is
expected to dip in the fourth quarter.  The central bank also cut its estimate for inflation in
2013 to 5.1 percent from 5.2 percent, governor Erdem Basci said
at a news conference in Ankara today to announce the bank’s
quarterly assessment of inflation.  The rate of price increases may accelerate in July, though
inflation isn’t expected to reach double figures, Basci said.
The rate will stabilize at 5 percent in the medium term, he
said.  Basci is tightening monetary policy by lending at rates
between his  benchmark  of 5.75 percent and an upper limit of 11.5
percent on a daily basis to help tame inflation and maintain
economic growth. Inflation was 8.9 percent in June compared with
8.3 percent in May and 11.1 percent in April, a three-year high.  The central bank’s measure of  core inflation  will continue
declining, Basci said.  The lira fell less than 0.1 percent to 1.8226 per dollar at
10:43 a.m. in Istanbul. Yields on two-year  government bonds 
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.88
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
