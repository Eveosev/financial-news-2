The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.2 percent to 635.43 at 4:15 p.m. New York
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.3
percent to 1,542.526.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cotton futures posted the biggest gain in almost two weeks
after government data showed increased demand for supplies from
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  Orange juice  declined.  Cotton for December delivery climbed 2.7 percent to settle
at 71.39 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since July 13.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery fell 0.2
percent to $1.0995 a pound. The price has slumped 35 percent
this year, partly because of easing demand.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures jumped to a two-week high as the surging cost
of livestock feed forced producers to spend less time fattening
animals, reducing pork supplies. Cattle prices rose.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.5 percent to
settle at 81.425 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. After the close of regular trading, the commodity

$89.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices have

percent, to $2.8685 a gallon on the Nymex. The September

percent this year.  The August contract expires tomorrow. The more actively
