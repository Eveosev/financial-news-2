Slovak lawmakers approved a tax
increase for banks and a surcharge for regulated companies in
the energy and telecommunications industries to boost  budget 
revenue.  The Parliament in the Slovak capital, Bratislava, supported
a 4.4 percent tax for all companies with an annual profit
exceeding 3 million euros ($3.75 million) and whose activities
are regulated by the state. Lawmakers also expanded the 0.4
percent tax on  bank deposits  to include retail funds and
introduced an one-time levy on lenders.  The government of the eastern euro-area nation is striving
to muster 1.5 billion euros in savings and additional revenue in
17 months to meet its pledge to narrow the  budget deficit  below
the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product.
Premier  Robert Fico  also plans to raise corporate income tax to
23 percent from 19 percent in 2013 as well as tax more highest-
earning individuals.  Fico, an advocate of more state influence in the economy,
has criticized banks and regulated companies for “excessive”
profits.  The  Finance Ministry  expects to collect an additional 175
million euros by next year by broadening the bank tax and
imposing a new levy. The tax surcharge on regulated companies,
due from October, should boost revenue by about 100 million
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
