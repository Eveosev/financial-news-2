For decades,  Thomas Mann  of the  Brookings Institution  and Norman Ornstein of the  American Enterprise Institute  have occupied the bull's eye at the center of the middle of Washington centrism. So it's pretty amazing that they can drop a book like " It's Even Worse Than It Looks " smack in the center (sorry) of an election year and cause so few political ripples. In a  review  in the  New York  Times last Sunday, Michael Crowley seemed  to be working to stifle a yawn. Granted, political scientists don't get to set the terms of election debate. But Mann and Ornstein's assessment of the Republican Party's role in American governance is unerringly stark: If that's too subtle, try this: "Much of the dysfunctionality Americans observe in their government is a direct consequence of the GOP's unabashed ambition to reverse decades of economic social policy by any means available." When do we get to the "on the one hand, on the other hand" part? The indictment continues in rat-a-tat style, fingering Republicans for: And the one quote from the book that does seem to have broken through the media: The  Republican Party , has become an insurgent outlier -- ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition. It's hard to imagine a more wholesale indictment from two eminent political scientists, each with a decades-long track record of nonpartisan analysis. It's equally hard to imagine the press quietly absorbing a similarly pedigreed indictment of the  Democratic Party ; the elite press, in particular, would likely talk of nothing else. Yet mainstream news outlets, while giving the authors fairly prominent play, seem to treat the their thesis as neither new nor news. What gives? Perhaps it's the soft bigotry of low expectations. The most anguish over the state of the Republican Party seems to flow from conservatives in varied states of excommunication, such as  David Frum ,  Bruce Bartlett  and a cadre of  smart ,  young   writers  who object to the empowered-state vision of Democrats but can't abide the  devolution of the Republicans. Many liberals, having perhaps never given sufficient credence to conservative thought in the first place, regard the book's premise with a knowing shrug.  Elected Republicans, naturally, dismiss the book as partisan hackery (though former Republican Senator Chuck Hagel gave it an enthusiastic blurb). Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell , with characteristic deference to facts, denounced the authors as "ultra, ultra liberal." But the authors -- and their centrist disposition -- are well known. Perhaps their thesis is, too. It's just that no one knows what can be done about it, or by whom. (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
