The forint had its biggest advance
in three months after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  said the central bank will do whatever is needed to
preserve the euro.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 1.6 percent to 284.27 per
euro by 4:22 p.m. in Budapest, the biggest jump on a closing
basis since April 25, the day when the European Commission gave
Hungary approval to start international aid negotiations. The
government’s benchmark 10-year bonds soared, cutting yields 19
basis points to 7.561 percent, after rising for four days.  European financial markets surged on speculation the ECB
will act to lower Spanish borrowing costs after yields on the
nation’s bonds rose to levels that prompted bailouts for Greece,
 Portugal  and Ireland.  Hungary may agree on a bailout with the  International
Monetary Fund  and the European Union by the end of autumn even
as views differ on a financial-transaction tax and the budget,
Mihaly Varga, the nation’s chief aid negotiator said on public
radio MR1-Kossuth today. The first round of aid talks finished
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
