LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, (MC) 
the world’s largest maker of  luxury goods , reported a 20
percent increase in first-half earnings and said it approaches
the second half of the year with confidence.  Profit from recurring operations climbed to 2.66 billion
euros ($3.27 billion), the Paris-based company said today in a
statement. The  median  of six estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
2.71 billion euros. Sales rose 26 percent to 12.97 billion
euros, or 12 percent excluding currency swings and acquisitions.  Hermes International SCA (RMS) , in which LVMH has a stake, last
week reported a 13 percent revenue increase, allaying concern
that Europe’s debt crisis and slowing growth in China are taking
a toll on demand for high-end goods. Global sales of luxury
goods may rise 7 percent in 2012, CA Cheuvreux analyst Thomas Mesmin estimates.  “We approach the second half of the year with confidence
and are relying upon the creativity and quality of our products
as well as the effectiveness of our teams to pursue further
market share gains in our historical markets as well as in high
potential emerging markets,”  LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Bernard Arnault  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
