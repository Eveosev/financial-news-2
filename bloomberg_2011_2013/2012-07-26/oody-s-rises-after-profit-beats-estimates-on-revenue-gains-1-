Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  and McGraw-Hill Cos.,
owners of the world’s largest ratings companies, reported profit
that beat analyst estimates as demand rose for their market data
and financial information.  Moody’s stock jumped 11 percent to $40.09, the biggest
increase in three years, after announcing second-quarter net
income of $172.5 million, or 76 cents a share, more than the 69
cents a share estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
McGraw-Hill rose 2.6 percent to $46.14.  Moody’s revenue rose 6 percent in the quarter even as
companies around the world sold fewer bonds with  Europe ’s debt
crisis stalling issuance plans. Sales for the New York-based
company’s unit that sells credit analysis, research and risk-
management services, rose 19 percent to $199.6 million, it said
today in a statement.  “We expect almost 10 percent revenue growth for ratings in
the second half,” Douglas Arthur, an analyst with Evercore
Partners Inc., said today in a report. U.S. bond issuance may
climb, increasing demand for ratings, he said.  Chief Executive Officer  Raymond McDaniel  said in the
statement he wouldn’t change annual earnings per share guidance
from a range of $2.62 to $2.72 despite the volatility in bond
sales.  Moody’s quarterly profit was down from $189 million, or 82
cents, a year earlier. Global corporate bond issuance fell 18
percent to $764 billion in the second quarter from $930.8
billion during the same period a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Revenue  Revenue for Moody’s increased to $640.8 million in the
quarter from $605.2 million a year earlier, the company said.
Sales for the unit that rates corporate bonds fell 4 percent to
$191.5 million, while the structured-finance business took in
$90.7 million, a 5 percent gain.  McGraw-Hill’s earnings excluding some items were 85 cents a
share, beating the 76-cent average of analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg, the company said today. Revenue at
 Standard & Poor’s  rose 1 percent to $483 million in the second
quarter. Operating profit for its commodities and commercial
division, which sells news and data, rose 45 percent to $71
million.  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is Moody’s biggest
 shareholder  with a 13 percent stake valued at about $1.1
billion, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
