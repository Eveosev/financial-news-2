Canada ’s dollar climbed to the
strongest since May versus its U.S. counterpart after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s comments about preserving
the 17-nation currency sparked a rally in higher-risk assets.  The Canadian currency was headed for an increase against
the greenback this week amid gains in stocks and crude oil, the
nation’s largest export. Draghi said policy makers will do
whatever is needed to preserve the euro.  “The big thing today was Draghi’s comments,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions,
a unit of Western Union Co, said in a telephone interview from
 Washington . “If the ECB, for whatever reason, fails to back up
what Mr. Draghi said today and his board members said yesterday,
you could see a general decrease in risk appetite, which could
weigh on the Canadian dollar.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, gained as much as
0.9 percent, the most this month, and advanced to C$1.0102 per
 U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, touching the strongest since
May 16. One Canadian dollar buys 99.01 cents.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.7 percent. Crude for
September delivery rose as much as 1.7 percent to $90.47 a
barrel in  New York . Canada’s currency is most closely correlated
with moves in stocks and commodity prices.  Year View  The Canadian dollar has risen 2 percent this year,
according to the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The
greenback has gained 0.8 percent and the euro has slipped 5.1
percent. Based on Canada’s domestic economy and core growth
rates, the loonie “should be, in the long term, a better
prospect for investors,” Bharadwaj said.  Government bonds  fell for a second day. The benchmark 10-
year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to
1.65 percent, as the price of the 2.75 percent security due in
June 2022 declined 54 cents to C$109.99.  The loonie strengthened beyond the 50-day, the 100-day, and
the 200-day moving averages and options-traders paid less for
protection against declines in the Canadian dollar versus its
U.S. counterpart.  The 100-day moving average at C$1.0087 is “proving a level
which has appeared more significant to the market of late” than
the 200-day,  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London , wrote in a note to
clients today.  Momentum Indicator  The average, a momentum indicator, is calculated by adding
closing prices for the past 100 days, then dividing by 100.
Crossing a moving average is often considered a turning point in
the direction of a security’s price.  So-called risk reversals show options traders are paying
less for protection against loonie weakness. The premium for the
right to buy the U.S. currency against the loonie in three
months, compared to the right to sell it, dropped to 1.43
percentage points today. It reached 0.99 percentage points on
July 20, the lowest this year.  “We’re still bullish on the Canadian dollar,”  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. Sutton predicts the
currency will reach 99 U.S. cents at the end of this year and 97
U.S. cents by the end of 2013.  That’s more bullish than median estimates in a Bloomberg
survey of 41 analysts and economists, which predict the loonie
will end 2012 at C$1.02 and 99 cents at the end of next year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
