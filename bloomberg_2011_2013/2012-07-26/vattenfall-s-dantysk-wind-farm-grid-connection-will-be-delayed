The link between Vattenfall AB’s
DanTysk wind farm in the  North Sea  and Germany’s power grid will
be delayed by as much as five months,  Siemens AG (SIE)  said.  “The connection with the grid is now planned for spring
2014,” Torsten Wolf, a spokesman for Siemens, said today by
phone from Erlangen, Germany. Siemens  previously said the link
would be ready by the start of 2014,  The delay to the 288-megawatt wind farm comes a day after
 RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest utility, postponed a decision
on whether to build the Innogy Nordsee 1 offshore wind farm
until 2013 while it seeks to clarify compensation for possible
delays to the grid connection there.  EON AG, Germany’s biggest utility, said in February that
its 288-megawatt farm Amrumbank West would be delayed for 15
months for the same reason.  “Offshore wind is still at a very initial stage in  Germany 
and we are losing speed before we even got started,” RWE’s new
chief executive officer, Peter Terium said in Berlin on June 27.  DanTysk is 51 percent owned by Vatenfall and 49 percent by
Stadwerke Muenchen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
