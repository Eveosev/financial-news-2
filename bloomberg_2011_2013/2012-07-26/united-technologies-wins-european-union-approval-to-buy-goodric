United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  won
European Union approval to buy  Goodrich Corp. (GR)  for $16.5 billion,
after it agreed to sell electrical power generation and small
engine control units.  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc must also be granted an option to
buy Goodrich’s project to develop a lean-burn fuel nozzle for
aircraft engines to eliminate regulators’ antitrust concerns
over the deal, the European Commission said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The remedies ensure that competition and incentives to
innovate remain strong in these high-technology markets, for the
ultimate benefit of the aerospace industry customers,” said EU
Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia .  The Goodrich deal is the largest aerospace acquisition on
record, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and adds the
world’s largest maker of aircraft landing gear to United
Technologies brands that include Pratt & Whitney jet engines and
Sikorsky helicopters. The purchase has an enterprise value of
$18.4 billion, including $1.9 billion in net debt, the companies
said in a statement when they announced the deal in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
