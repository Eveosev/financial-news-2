The  European Central Bank  will show
“some movement” in supporting the European Financial Stability
Facility and European Stability Mechanism, Dutch newspaper  Het
Financieele Dagblad  reported today, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the plans.  A banking license for the ESM would comply with the ECB’s
charter because the fund, which is yet to become operational,
will have the status of an international financial institution,
Het Financieele Dagblad cited the Brussels-based person as
saying. The  European Investment Bank  is able to directly borrow
from the ECB, which may serve as a precedent, the person said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
