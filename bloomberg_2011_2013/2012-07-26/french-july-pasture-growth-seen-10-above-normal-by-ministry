French grasslands grew more than
usual this month, with pasture production estimated to be 10
percent above normal levels as of July 20, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said.  Forage levels are getting close to normal except in the
countryâ€™s south, where pasture production is lower than usual
due to hot and dry weather, the ministry said in a  report  on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
