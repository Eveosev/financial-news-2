(Corrects interest rate forecast in headline, second and
fifth paragraphs.)  Hungary ’s central bank will cut its
benchmark interest rate to the lowest level since December 2011
by the end of this year as the economy is set to slide into
recession, according to a survey of economists.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will lower the two-week  deposit
rate  to 6.50 percent from 7 percent by end-2012, with policy
makers cutting the rate by half a percentage point in the fourth
quarter, according to the median estimate of 23 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy will  shrink  0.8 percent this
year, compared with a previous projection for a contraction of
0.2 percent, the poll showed.  Hungary has kept  interest rates  unchanged for seven months
as aid negotiations stalled and the  inflation  outlook worsened.
Talks with the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union restarted last week and the Cabinet hopes to seal an
agreement by the end of autumn,  Mihaly Varga , the country’s
chief bailout negotiator said today.  The forint, which gained 10.5 percent against the euro this
year as investors speculated that Hungary will obtain an IMF
bailout, rallied 1.2 percent to 285.06 per euro at 12:58 p.m. in
Budapest after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
policy makers will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro.
The yield on the government bond maturing in 2022 declined 12
basis points to 7.63 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will cut borrowing costs to 6
percent by the end of June 2013 and keep it at that level for
the rest of the year, according to the survey.  Hungary, which introduced special taxes on several
industries and nationalized private pension fund savings to
narrow its budget  deficit  to below an EU limit of 3 percent of
gross domestic product, faces a 75 percent risk of slipping into
recession over the next 12 months, the survey showed.  The budget shortfall is forecast to be 3 percent of GDP in
both 2012 and 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
