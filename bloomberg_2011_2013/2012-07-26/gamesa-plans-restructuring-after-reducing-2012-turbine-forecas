Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM)  reduced
its 2012 sales forecast and will announce a restructuring plan
in October after reporting its first half-year loss since the
Spanish turbine maker’s 2000 initial public offering.  Gamesa expects to sell a total of 2,000 megawatts of
turbines this year, compared with a February forecast of 2,800
megawatts to 3,200 megawatts, according to a  statement  on its
website yesterday. The Zamudio, Spain-based company had a net
loss of 33 million euros ($41 million) in the first six months
of 2012, down from a profit of 29 million euros in the same
period in 2011.  “There’s been a very, very significant slump in  Asia ,
especially China and  India ,” Chief Executive Officer Ignacio Martin said on a conference call yesterday. “This means the
factory activity we’ll have in the second half will be very
low.”  Turbine-makers from Gamesa to the world’s biggest,  Vestas
Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  of Aarhus,  Denmark , are struggling as
overcapacity and slowing demand force down turbine prices, which
fell to 910,000 euros a megawatt in the second half of 2011,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the lowest since at
least 2008 when the London research company began tracking the
data.  Gamesa  shares  rose almost 20 percent yesterday to 1.206
euros. The stock has lost 77 percent of its value in the past
year. The company released its earnings after the end of trading
in  Madrid .  Martin, who replaced Jorge Calvet as CEO on May 23, said
he’s working on a restructuring plan that Gamesa will announce
in October. The company has a manufacturing capacity of about
3,800 megawatts, and needs to lower that to adjust to lower
demand, Martin said.  ‘Too Big’  “We are too big,” Martin said. “We have to reduce our
size and adjust to lower demand.”  It’s the second time this year that Gamesa has cut its
sales forecast. Its February forecast was cut from an initial
prediction of 3,000 megawatts to 3,500 megawatts of sales.  Chinese sales dropped to 5 percent of Gamesa’s total in the
first half, from 20 percent in the same period of 2011. The
Indian proportion fell to 14 percent from 17 percent. The
proportion of sales in  Latin America  more than doubled to 40
percent, and in the U.S. it rose to 25 percent from 15 percent.  Sales of 1.6 billion euros were 27 percent higher than in
the first half of last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
