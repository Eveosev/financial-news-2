Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. (JOPT)  is
seeking to buy about 830,000 metric tons of oil products in
three separate tenders, the company said, without specifying
delivery dates.  The Amman-based operator of Jordan’s sole refinery plans to
purchase 500,000 tons of diesel, 210,000 tons of fuel oil and
120,000 tons of unleaded gasoline, according to announcements
posted on the company’s website. Suppliers have until July 31 to
bid, it said. Jordan Petroleum Refinery has a processing
capacity of 90,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Jordan, one of the smallest economies in the  Middle East ,
imports most of its energy. Its power plants have switched to
burning more expensive fuels after repeated halts in natural-
gas shipments from neighboring  Egypt , as a result of sabotage
attacks on an export pipeline in the Sinai Desert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
