Indian equities retreated to the
lowest level in seven weeks as concerns over slowing company
earnings countered speculation U.S. and European central banks
may take fresh stimulus steps.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , which has the biggest weighting on the BSE India
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , declined after first-quarter revenue trailed
estimates.  Infosys Ltd. (INFY) , the second-biggest software exporter,
fell to the lowest close in almost three years.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) 
led other lenders lower. The 30-stock Sensex fell 1.2 percent to
16,639.82, its lowest close since June 6.  As many as 40 percent of Sensex companies that have posted
June-quarter results trailed profit estimates as high interest
costs and policy paralysis in the government slowed economic
growth to a near-decade low even as Europe’s debt crisis curbed
exports. The European Union is India’s largest partner.  “Some earnings have been disappointing and the inaction on
policy reforms is keeping sentiments subdued,” said Rikesh Parikh, vice president of equities at Motilal Oswal Securities
Ltd. in Mumbai. “High interest costs and weak demand seem to
have reduced revenues.”  Six out of 15 companies in the Sensex have missed earnings
estimates, compared with 30 percent that trailed  forecasts  in
the quarter ended March, and 47 percent three months earlier,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh , who took control of the
 finance ministry  in June, has pledged to revive an economic
reforms agenda stymied by opposition from his own allies. The
government last year suspended a plan to allow  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and other foreign companies to open supermarkets, while an
anti-corruption bill and proposals to allow foreign investment
in aviation and pensions are also stalled.  ‘Rhetoric’  Investors also expect Singh to raise diesel prices for the
first time in a year, a move that would help state-run refiners
that sell fuels at below-market rates.  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) ,  Bharat
Petroleum Corp. (BPCL)  and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL)  lose 3.6 billion
rupees ($64 million) a day on fuel sales, government data show,
and rely on subsidies and discounted crude purchases from state
explorers to recover losses.  “Everything’s not perfect and we would like to see more by
way of government policy, more in terms of specifics as opposed
to rhetoric,”  Jeff Chowdhry , head of emerging-market equities
at U.K.-based  F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) , told Bloomberg UTV
today. “The market at the moment is narrow and based on
companies which are delivering independent of the government
policy rather than with the help of it.”  Growth Measures  Asian stocks had their first advance in five days after a
drop in U.S. new home sales fueled speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may take new steps to spur growth, boosting demand for
growth-sensitive shares. European Central Bank council member
Ewald Nowotny said there were arguments in favor of giving the
European Stability Mechanism a banking license, opening access
to ECB lending.  Infosys lost 2.1 percent to 2,123.80 rupees, the lowest
close since Aug. 25, 2009. ICICI Bank dropped 1.2 percent to
906.75 rupees.  State Bank of India , the largest lender, slid 2.6
percent to 2,017.4, a two-month low.  HDFC Bank (HDFCB)  retreated 1.8
percent to 565.80 rupees, a one-month low.  ITC, which has a 9.7 percent weighting in the Sensex, fell
2.1 percent to 249.45 rupees. First-quarter revenue of 66.5
billion rupees was lower than the 66.8 billion rupees estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. Net income rose 20 percent to 16
billion rupees in the three months ended June, beating the 15.8
billion-rupee median of 24 analysts’ estimates.  Land Rover  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, sank 3.7
percent to 205.1 rupees, the lowest price since Jan 11.  Bharat
Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL)  dropped 2 percent to 211.95 rupees. The
electric equipment manufacturer said first-quarter profit rose
to 9.21 billion rupees, higher than the 8.23 billion rupees
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Sterlite Industries Ltd. (STLT)  lost 2.9 percent to 97.45 rupees.
Net income fell to 12 billion rupees, still beating the 11.5
billion rupees estimate of 26 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.
Earnings were announced after markets closed.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, fell 2.3 percent to 16.37,
the lowest since Sept 2010. The Nifty index dropped 1.3 percent
to 5,043. Its August futures settled at 5,083.50. The BSE-200
Index decreased 1.3 percent.  Combined volume  on the nation’s top
two bourses was 768 million shares yesterday, 15 percent less
than the 12-month daily average of 899 million shares.  The Sensex has gained 8 percent this year, partly because
of record purchases by overseas  investors , who have bought a net
$10.2 billion in local equities since Jan. 1, the highest in
Asia and a record for the period. The stock gauge trades at 13.1
times estimated earnings, compared with the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index’s 10 times.  Overseas investors sold a net 2.11 billion rupees of local
stocks on July 24, the first sales in 18 days, data from the
market regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
