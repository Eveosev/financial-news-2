Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , the biggest copper
producer in  Kazakhstan , said first-half output of the finished
metal dropped by 11 percent as maintenance halted its Balkhash
smelter and the grades of metal it delivered declined.  Output in the first half slid to 136,100 metric tons from
153,000 tons a year earlier, the London-based company said today
in a statement. Second-quarter production rose 9 percent to
71,000 tons from the previous three months, when adverse weather
also hit output, according to the statement.  “The decrease reflects the lower volume of copper in
concentrate produced and the planned repairs to the Balkhash
smelter during March and April 2012,” the company said.  Copper output was 10 percent ahead of the estimate from
Nomura Holdings Inc. and 17 percent better than the forecast at
Liberum Capital Ltd., the two said today in separate notes.  Kazakhmys rose 1.8 percent to 675 pence by 11:26 a.m. in
 London  trading, paring its loss for the year to 27 percent.  Kazakhmys, seeking to boost output by about two-thirds to
500,000 tons a year by opening two mines, plans to start
production at its Bozshakol project in 2015 and Aktogay in 2016.
The company also began extracting ore from its Konyrat mine,
shut in 2008 because of lower metal grades, it said.  ‘Low Grade’  “As the low grade Konyrat mine is ramped up, there will be
pressure on cash costs,” Paul Cliff and Biraj Borkhataria,
analysts at ING Groep NV, wrote today in an e-mail. “We
forecast Kazakhmys’s cash generation ability to fall
dramatically with net cash cost plus maintenance capex rising by
60 percent per pound of production over 2011-2013.”  The company said it’s on track to meet the production
target of 285,000 tons to 295,000 tons of copper this year.  “Following the severe weather at the start of the year, we
are continuing to raise our output and we remain on track to
meet our production targets,” Chief Executive Officer Oleg Novachuk said in the statement.  The company will process the stockpiled ore and copper in
concentrate in the second half, “assisted by improved
availability of equipment,” according to the statement.  Output of copper in concentrate was 148,400 tons in the
first half compared with 153,300 tons. The average copper grade
in ore fell to 0.99 percent from 1.01 percent. Zinc contained in
concentrate in the first half fell to 71,600 tons, from 75,600.  Copper for three-month delivery in London plunged by about
15 percent to average $7,829 a ton in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
