Anyone buying  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s stock
after last quarter’s sales shortfall at the iPhone maker has
history on their side, according to  Gene Munster , a Piper
Jaffray Cos. analyst.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how Apple performed after four
earlier cases of disappointing quarterly revenue, as tracked by
Munster. They occurred in fiscal 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2011, with
iPhone sales trailing estimates in the latter case.  Six months later, the shares were 23 percent higher on
average.  “It’s going to be an in-vogue stock again shortly,”
Munster said yesterday in a Bloomberg Radio interview. He cited
the pending introduction of the next iPhone model, known as the
iPhone 5, which he expects in October.  “We’re going to see a significant rebound in the December
quarter, and that’s probably an understatement,” he said. The
Minneapolis-based analyst rates Apple outperform, meaning he
expects the stock to beat the median percentage change for
companies he covers.  Apple’s revenue was $35 billion during the fiscal third
quarter, which ended in June. Analysts expected $37.2 billion on
average from the company, based in Cupertino,  California ,
according to a Bloomberg survey. IPhone sales of 26 million
trailed an average projection of 28.4 million.  Apple, the world’s largest company by market value, fell
4.3 percent to $574.97 at the close in  New York  yesterday. The
shares have gained 42 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
