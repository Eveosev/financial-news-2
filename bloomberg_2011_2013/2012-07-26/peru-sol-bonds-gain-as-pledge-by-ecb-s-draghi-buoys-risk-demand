Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
lower for a second day, after European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  pledged to preserve the euro, spurring demand for
higher-yielding emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 4.66 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The price rose 0.14 centimo to 121 centimos per sol.  Global stocks advanced and emerging-market currencies
rallied on speculation the ECB will act to lower Spanish
borrowing costs after yields on the nation’s bonds rose to
levels that prompted bailouts for Greece, Portugal and Ireland.  “The positive news is driving risk appetite,” Augusto Saldarriaga, the head analyst of Banco Internacional del Peru,
said by phone from Lima. “In an environment of low  interest
rates  in Europe and the U.S., all this liquidity is looking for
better returns in countries like Peru.”  The sol gained 0.4 percent to 2.628 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.638 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The central bank said on its website that it didn’t buy
dollars in the  spot market  today. So far this month it has
purchased $745 million in a bid to slow the sol’s advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
