Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) , the
world’s second-largest cruise operator, fell the most in more
than three months as a stronger  U.S. dollar  and the need to
discount tours in Europe prompted the company to cut its annual
profit forecast.  Royal Caribbean  tumbled  6 percent to $22.85 at 10:26 a.m.
in New York, after earlier declining 7.6 percent for the biggest
intraday drop since April 20. The Miami-based company had fallen
1.9 percent this year through yesterday.  “It is hard to distinguish how much of the pressure in
Europe is connected to the Costa Concordia incident and how much
is due to the economic roller coaster,” Brian Rice, chief
financial officer, said in a statement, referring to an accident
in January off the coast of  Italy  involving a ship owned by
 Carnival Corp. (CCL)  “The timing of the incident left a big gap
during our peak booking period and filling that gap is
disrupting our normal booking patterns,” he said.  Full-year profit will be $1.70 to $1.80 a share, the
company said. That compares with a prior forecast of $1.80 to
$2.10 a share. The average analyst  estimate  was $2.01, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The strengthening of the U.S. dollar and decreases in fuel
pricing “have essentially offset one another,” the company
said. A stronger dollar reduced the full year outlook by about
13 cents a share, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
