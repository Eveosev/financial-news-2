U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal
Wolin said  Europe  needs to take actions to match its words that
it will do what it takes to preserve the euro.  “I think it’s important for the markets to hear that and
have confidence,” Wolin said on CNBC. ”Of course beyond the
words there needs to be actions.”  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled today
that officials are prepared to do whatever is needed to preserve
the euro and act on surging bond yields that are tearing at the
seams of the 17-nation currency bloc.  ”If they have the will and capacity they need to take
those steps to continue on the path,” Wolin said. ”This is in
the end something the Europeans are going to have to come around
but I think they’ll do it in the end.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
