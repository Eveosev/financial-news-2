South Korea ’s current-account
surplus widened to a record in June as concern over slowing
global growth capped consumer sentiment and demand for imports.  The  surplus  was $5.8 billion, compared with a revised
surplus of $3.6 billion in May, the Bank of Korea said in a
statement in Seoul today. The current account is the broadest
measure of trade, tracking goods, services and investment
income.  Asia ’s fourth-largest economy grew at the slowest pace in
almost three years last quarter, with BOK Governor Kim Choong Soo warning this week the nation risks failing to meet a 3
percent growth estimate for 2012. HSBC Holdings Plc and
Citigroup Inc. have said policy makers may follow a July 12 rate
cut with more easing this year.  “Imports declined across the board from capital goods to
 consumer goods , boding ill for the economy,” said  Park Sang
Hyun , chief economist at HI Investment & Securities Co. in
Seoul. “The quality of trade is deteriorating fast with both
exports and imports shrinking. We may see another rate cut as
early as next month.”  Imports of capital goods dropped to $11.3 billion in June
from $11.7 billion in May while imports of consumer goods fell
to $4.3 billion from $4.5 billion, according to today’s report.
Imports of raw materials slipped to $26.8 billion from $28.6
billion on falling prices.  Economy Slows  Gross domestic product  expanded 2.4 percent in the three
months through June from a year earlier, compared with the
median 2.5 percent estimate of 15 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News, according to a  Bank of Korea  report yesterday.
From the previous quarter, growth was 0.4 percent.  The won advanced 0.5 percent to 1,141.65 per dollar at 9:23
a.m. in Seoul after earlier touching 1,140.33, the highest level
since July 20. The Kospi index of stocks gained 1.6 percent.  The surplus on traded goods was $5 billion last month
compared with a revised $1.7 billion surplus in May, today’s
report showed.  Total exports on a customs-cleared basis rose to $47.3
billion in June from $47 billion in May, according to today’s
statement. Imports were at $42.3 billion, down from $44.7
billion May, partly due to falling oil prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
