Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s
largest carmaker, cut its global industrywide automobile demand
forecast for this year, citing a worse-than-expected economic
situation in  Europe  and China.  The Seoul-based automaker expects 77.1 million units to be
sold globally, down by about 500,000 units from what it forecast
in April, Chief Financial Officer Lee Won Hee said today.
Industrywide demand in Europe will fall to about 6.43 million
vehicles in the second half, after about 7.65 million units were
sold in the first six months this year, amid the worsening
economic situation, Lee said.  Hyundai’s revised forecast comes at a time when
industrywide deliveries in the region dropped 3.2 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales in  China  may also
be curbed by the registration limits imposed by major cities in
the world’s largest automobile market.  “The economic situation in Europe will worsen in the
second half of this year,” Hyundai’s Lee said in a conference
call in  Seoul  today. “Still, Hyundai will be able to meet the
global sales target we set earlier this year.”  Separately, Hyundai reported second-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as  net income  climbed 10 percent to
2.55 trillion won ($2.2 billion) from 2.31 trillion won a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
