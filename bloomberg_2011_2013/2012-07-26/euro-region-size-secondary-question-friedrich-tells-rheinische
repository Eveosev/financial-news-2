Improving the competitiveness of all
European economies is more important than the size of the euro
region, German Interior Minister  Hans-Peter Friedrich  told the
 Rheinische Post .  “Europe is more than just the euro,” the newspaper cited
Friedrich as saying in an interview. He added that countries
such as Poland are outside the euro region and are still
competitive, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
