Hungarian discus thrower Zoltan
Kovago was banned for two years by sport’s top court after his
national committee refused to suspend him.  An appeal panel found that Kovago refused to submit a
sample for testing in August 2011, the Court of Arbitration for
Sport said today in an e-mailed statement.  The International Assocations of Athletics Federations
asked the Hungarian Athletics Association and the country’s
anti-doping organization to take action against the athlete, but
he was found not guilty, CAS said. The IAAF appealed in July and
the decision was announced today.  “The CAS Panel in charge of this case found that Zoltan
Kovago was guilty of an anti-doping rule violation and
sanctioned him with a two-year period of ineligibility,” CAS
said in the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
