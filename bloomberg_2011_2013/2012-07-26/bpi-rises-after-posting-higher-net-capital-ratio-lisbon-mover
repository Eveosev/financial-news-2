Banco BPI SA (BPI) , Portugal’s fifth-
biggest bank, rose 4.2 percent in Lisbon trading after reporting
higher first-half profit and an improvement in its capital
ratio.  The stock  climbed  2 euro cents to 50.1 cents in the
Portuguese capital, the highest close this week. Banks across
 Europe  also rallied after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to defend the euro.  BPI said after the close of trading yesterday that first-
half net income rose 7.5 percent to 85.1 million euros. Its core
Tier 1 capital ratio as of June 30 was 14.5 percent, based on
Bank of Portugal rules, and 9.4 percent according to the
European Banking Authority’s criteria.  “The results reflect a set of very relevant improvements
in BPI’s capital and liquidity position,” Andre Rodrigues, an
analyst at Caixa-Banco de Investimento SA with a “buy”
recommendation on the stock, said today in a research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
