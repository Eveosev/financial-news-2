PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ’s credit
ratings, already below investment grade, were cut by Moody’s
Investors Service and face another reduction unless the company
takes further measures to reduce losses and cash burn.  The Paris-based automaker’s long-term rating was lowered to
Ba2 from Ba1, Moody’s said in a statement today. The reduction
brings it into line with Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,
which both cut their grades on Peugeot yesterday.  “Moody’s believes that PSA faces intensified operational
stress, with financial metrics that are anticipated to be
commensurate with the single-B rating category by year-end and
are unlikely to recover beyond the low to mid-Ba range over the
next two years,” the rating company said in a statement.  Peugeot yesterday reported a 662 million-euro ($804
million) first half loss at its automaking division, matching
the amount pledged by the French government to aid automakers.
The stock has dropped 76 percent over the past year, reducing
the company’s market value to 2.2 billion euros.  Credit ratings will be cut again unless Peugeot takes
“further actions to stabilize the operations,” the French
government supports low-emission vehicles, or a “more detailed
assessment of the company’s prospects causes Moody’s to believe
that the stabilization and turnaround will be accelerated,” the
ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
