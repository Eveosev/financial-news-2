Daimler AG (DAI) , the maker of Mercedes-
Benz cars and trucks, is the company whose debt is most
frequently linked by structured notes this year.  Banks led by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg and DZ Bank AG
sold $518 million of securities tied to the world’s third-
largest maker of luxury vehicles, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That compares with $442 million of issuance linked to
steel company  ArcelorMittal (MT) , while Spanish phone operator
 Telefonica SA (TEF)  was referenced by $130 million of securities.  Daimler’s earnings of 2.24 billion euros ($2.72 billion)
before interest and taxes in the second quarter and its
investment-grade rating are key factors in the company’s appeal,
said Nordine Farsi, head of structured credit trading at LBBW in
London. Daimler is ranked A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and an
equivalent A- by Standard & Poor’s.  The company faces the “challenge” of slowing global
economic growth, Daimler Chief Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche 
said yesterday, with auto demand in Europe poised to decline for
the fifth straight year.  Credit-linked notes are securities that use derivatives
tied to the performance of a company or country’s debt and offer
higher yields and maturities that may not be available in the
bond market. Investors suffer losses if there’s a default for
either the bank issuing the note or the reference entity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
