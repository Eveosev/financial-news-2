Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  Chief
Financial Officer Colleen Johnston says Canada’s second-largest
bank is assuming policy interest rates will remain unchanged
next year, both at home and in the U.S.  “We think the macro environment is tough and it’s probably
realistic to assume flat rates” throughout 2013, Johnston said
yesterday in an interview at Bloomberg’s  New York  headquarters.  Johnston’s Canadian prediction contrasts with that of Bank
of Canada Governor  Mark Carney , who said as recently as last
week by that it “may become appropriate” to raise the
country’s benchmark lending rate for the first time since Sept.
2010. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is
for an increase to come in the second quarter of 2013.  “Most economists -- our own included -- would be
predicting a couple of rate increases next year,” said
Johnston.  Johnston, 54, said that while Canada’s  housing market  may
be “overvalued,” the country isn’t in a housing bubble.  “I think you’ll see a gradual softening of the Canadian
market, and I don’t think you’ll see any dramatic correction in
the market,” Johnston said. “The economy is strong, employment
is good,  interest rates  are low and they’re going to remain low,
certainly for the foreseeable future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
