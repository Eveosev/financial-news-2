A  California  man pleaded guilty to
trying to export missile components illegally from the U.S. to
Iran.  Andro Telemi, 42, today admitted one charge of attempting
to export defense articles from the U.S. without a license or
approval from the State Department. He faces as much as 20 years
in prison when he’s sentenced Oct. 30 in federal court in
Chicago.  “Our national security is threatened when anyone attempts
to illegally export restricted military components that could
fall into the wrong hands,” agent Gary Hartwig of  Homeland
Security Investigations , a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, said in a statement.  Telemi, of  Sun Valley , California, is a naturalized U.S.
citizen from Iran. He was contacted by a co-defendant in 2009 to
provide assistance in purchasing and exporting to Iran through
Dubai,  United Arab Emirates , 10 connector adapters for anti-
armor missile systems, according to the statement.  Telemi negotiated the purchase from a company that was
controlled by law enforcement authorities, the government said.
The price of each adaptor was $9,450.  The co-defendant, Davoud Baniameri, 39, of Woodland Hills,
California, pleaded guilty in 2011 and was sentenced to four
years and three months in prison.  The case is U.S. v. Baniameri, 09-cr-736, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
