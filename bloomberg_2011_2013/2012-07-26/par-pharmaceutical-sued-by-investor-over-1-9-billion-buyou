Par Pharmaceutical Cos. (PAR) , the
generic-drug maker being bought by TPG Capital for
$1.9 billion, was sued by a shareholder who contends investors
will be shortchanged in the deal.  Directors of  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Par are duty-
bound to enhance share value in a takeover and have avoided
competitive bidding, Rena Nadoff contended in a July 24
complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington.  “The long-term prospects for Par are great” and the sale
price of $50 a share is too low, Nadoff said. Par “is in a
position to see increased revenues with the implementation of
the  healthcare reform  act,” as the law’s emphasis on cost
control spurs increased use of generic drugs, Nadoff said.  Nadoff asked a judge to stop the transaction and award
damages and legal fees. Par and TPG, a private-equity firm based
in  Fort Worth ,  Texas , said July 16 they agreed to the deal at a
37 percent premium, subject to a shareholder vote and regulatory
approval.  Allison Wey, a Par spokeswoman, didn’t immediately reply to
a voice-mail message seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Nadoff v. Par Pharmaceutical Cos, CA7715,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
