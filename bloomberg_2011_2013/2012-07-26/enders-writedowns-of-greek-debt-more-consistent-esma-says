The way  banks  value their holdings
of Greek sovereign debt improved since last year, according to a
survey by European Union regulators.  The European Securities and Markets Authority said that
lenders have a “good level of consistency” in their accounting
treatment of Greece’s sovereign debt. Still, there are concerns
that lenders aren’t providing enough data to investors on their
Greek holdings.  “A significant number of issues remain to be addressed by
issuers in relation to their transparency to investors,” ESMA
said in an e-mailed statement. The authority will continue to
monitor the “granularity of information” provided by lenders
on their sovereign holdings.  International accounting standard setters warned last year
that some European banks hadn’t sufficiently written down the
value of bonds issued by  Greece  and other nations with large
budget deficits.  Greece’s private creditors agreed last year to take a 50
percent loss on the face value of their Greek debt holdings as
part of the second bailout of the country since 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
