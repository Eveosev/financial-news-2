Consumer confidence  in the U.S. fell
last week to the lowest level in two months as Americans became
more concerned about sluggish growth in employment.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index fell to minus 38.5 in
the week ended July 22 from minus 37.9 in the previous period.  An index of the buying climate, one of the three components
of the index, fell to minus 44.7, its lowest reading since May.
A gauge of personal finances rose to 1.2 from 0.7, and a measure
of the state of the economy improved to minus 71.9 from minus
72.8.  The confidence of full-time workers dropped to minus 32,
the lowest level since February. Sentiment among households
earning more than $100,000 turned positive for the first time in
five weeks.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, produced by Langer
Research Associates, is based on responses to telephone
interviews with a random sample of 1,000 consumers 18 years old
and older.  Each week, 250 respondents are surveyed, and the percentage
of negative responses is subtracted from the share of positive
views and divided by three. The most recent reading is based on
the average of responses over the previous four weeks.  The comfort index can range from 100, indicating every
participant in the survey had a positive response to all three
components, to minus 100, signaling all views were negative. The
margin of error for the headline reading is 3 percentage points.  Editors: Christopher Wellisz  To contact the reporter on this story:
