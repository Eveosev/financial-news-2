Ethanol fell for a sixth day on
speculation that higher corn prices, boosted by drought in the
U.S. Midwest, and lower gasoline demand will reduce production
of the biofuel.  Futures slipped as the rising price of corn, used to make
ethanol in the U.S., has erased profit margins for producers.
Gasoline  demand  over the four weeks ended July 20 was 3.1
percent below a year earlier, according to Energy Department
data.  “Corn is way over ethanol and there’s no margin for
producers,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates in
 Chicago . “A lot of production is closed. Weak longs are exiting
the market and futures are getting beat up.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 3.3 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.54 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest settlement since July 12. Prices have dropped 6.1
percent this week, narrowing the 2012 gain to 15 percent.  Corn for December delivery declined 11.75 cents, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $7.7625 a bushel as rain was expected to
ease the drought in parts of the grain-rich Midwest. The price
has jumped 24 percent in a month. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. Producers would lose 37 cents a gallon on
ethanol based on December futures prices.  “Lower corn and more, creating prospects for a better crop
and an even lower corn price, would bring down the price of
ethanol,” said  Sander Cohan , a global transportation fuels
analyst and principal with Energy Security Analysis Inc. in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  In cash market trading, ethanol fell 6.5 cents to $2.63 a
gallon in  New York , 4 cents to $2.525 in Chicago, 3.5 cents to
$2.585 on the  Gulf Coast  and 6.5 cents to $2.735 on the West
Coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
