Asian currencies advanced on
speculation policy makers will unveil further stimulus measures
to bolster the global economy after reports showed growth slowed
in the region and in Europe.  Taiwan’s dollar rebounded from a six-month low and  China ’s
 yuan  rose from the weakest since September 2011 after new home
sales in the U.S. fell 8.4 percent in June from a two-year high.
South Korea’s economy grew at the slowest pace in almost three
years last quarter, the central bank said. The Philippine peso
climbed from this month’s low before a rate decision today,
while the  Reserve Bank  of  India  next meets on July 31.  “The market is reacting positively to expectations that
policy makers are lining up actions to stem growth risks,” said
Ashish Agrawal, an Asia ex-Japan rates strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG in Singapore. “Korea and China are expected to
continue easing and so will India. Low inflation will likely
allow the  Philippines  to act should the growth outlook
deteriorate.”  The won gained 0.4 percent to 1,146.78 per dollar as of
11:13 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.2 percent to NT$30.143, the peso
strengthened 0.2 percent to 42.085 and Malaysia’s ringgit rose
0.2 percent to 3.1687.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (MXAP) , which tracks the
region’s currencies, rose. Its 60-day historical volatility was
little changed at 3.77 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of
stocks gained 0.5 percent, snapping a four-day slide.  ‘Increasingly Shaky’  South Korea’s economy expanded 2.4 percent in the three
months ended June 30, the slowest pace since the third quarter
of 2009. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan cited the Europe crisis
as a reason, saying additional fiscal stimulus is being held in
reserve.  European Central Bank council member Ewald Nowotny said in
an interview published yesterday that there are merits in giving
the European Stability Mechanism a banking license to help
tackle the region’s crisis.  “The ESM talks in  Europe  yesterday eased risk-averse
sentiment,” said Byeon Ji Young, a currency analyst at Woori
Futures Co. in Seoul. “The GDP data may limit won gains.”  The peso advanced the most since July 17. The Philippine
central bank will hold its overnight overnight rate at 4 percent
at today’s meeting, according to 11 of 15 analysts in a survey.
Four predicted a cut. Governor Amando Tetangco said on July 24
“there is some scope to adjust monetary policy settings to
protect the inflation target on the downside.”  Yuan Fixing  The yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.3846 per dollar in  Shanghai 
as the People’s Bank of China strengthened its  reference rate 
for the first time in four days, by 0.08 percent to 6.3381. In
the U.S., the  Federal Open Market Committee  meets July 31 and
Aug. 1.  “Investors have revived hopes for quantitative easing in
the U.S., leading to a firmer yuan today,” said  Daniel Chan ,
executive vice-president at Glory Sky Global Markets Ltd.
“Chinese officials are still worried about exports as Europe’s
debt crisis continues.”  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht climbed 0.1 percent to 31.65 per
dollar, after hitting 32 on July 23, the weakest levels since
August 2010. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,494, and
Vietnam’s dong was little changed at 20,883.  To contact the reporters on this story:
