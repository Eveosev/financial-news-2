Ira Rubin, accused of helping
process billions of dollars in payments for illegal online
gambling businesses, was sentenced to three years in prison and
ordered to forfeit $5 million.  Rubin, who pleaded guilty in January, was accused by
federal prosecutors in New York of illegally processing payments
for PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and  Absolute Poker , the leading
online poker sites doing business with U.S. customers.  The government and Rubin’s defense attorney had recommended
a sentence between 18 and 24 months, as specified in federal
guidelines, which are advisory. U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan 
in  Manhattan  today said such a sentence wouldn’t serve to
discourage future crime.  “You are an unreformed conman and fraudster,” Kaplan told
Rubin, calling his actions a “brazen” defiance of U.S. law.
“A significant sentence is necessary to protect the
community.”  Kaplan explained that he assumed Rubin would receive credit
for the nine months he has already spent in jail, and could be
released after only 31 months if he maintains good behavior.  Once he is out of prison, one of the conditions of Rubin’s
release will be that he cannot participate in any business
occupation related to payment processing or financial services,
Kaplan said.  The case was U.S. v. Rubin, 10-CR-336, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
