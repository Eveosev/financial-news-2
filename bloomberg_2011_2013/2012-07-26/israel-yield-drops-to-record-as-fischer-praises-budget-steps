Israel ’s benchmark bonds rose,
pushing the yield to a record low, after central bank Governor
Stanley Fischer said the government’s recent budget steps
represent “important progress.”  The yield on the Mimshal Shiklit notes due January 2022
declined seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 3.97
percent at 3:58 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest since they were
announced in March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
