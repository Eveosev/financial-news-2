 The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will trim exports through to the middle of
next month as refiners cut their crude intake during seasonal
maintenance, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements.  OPEC, responsible for about 40 percent of global supplies,
will curb daily exports by 0.3 percent to 23.84 million in the
four weeks to Aug. 11, compared with 23.91 million a month
earlier, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. The
data exclude Angola and Ecuador.  “The tanker market’s dead because crude demand is
sluggish,”  Roy Mason , the company’s founder, said by telephone
from Halifax,  England . “We’re into the long period of seasonal
decline and this goes on until the beginning of October.”  Exports from the Middle East, including non-OPEC members
Oman and Yemen, will be little changed at 17.51 million barrels
a day in the four-week period, according to Oil Movements.  Crude on board tankers will average 496.24 million barrels,
down 0.5 percent from the month to July 14, the researcher said.
Oil Movements calculates shipments by tallying tanker-rental
agreements. Its figures exclude oil held on board vessels used
as floating storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela . It plans to meet next on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
