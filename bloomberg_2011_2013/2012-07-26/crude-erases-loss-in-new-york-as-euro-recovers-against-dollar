Oil erased losses in New York as the
euro rebounded against the dollar, making commodities priced in
the U.S. currency more attractive.  Crude for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose as much as 29 cents to $89.26 a barrel and was at
$89.25 at 11:37 a.m. London time. The contract earlier fell 1
percent to $88.07. The euro was up 0.5 percent to $1.2222 after
weakening 0.3 percent to $1.2118.  To contact the reporter on this story:
