Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd. (STLT) ,
the nation’s biggest copper producer, reported a 27 percent
decline in first-quarter profit as costs increased and prices of
base metals fell amid waning global demand.  Group  net income  fell to 12 billion rupees ($215 million),
or 3.57 rupees a share, in the three months ended June 30 from
16.4 billion rupees, or 4.73 rupees, a year earlier, the unit of
 Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  said today in a statement to the  stock
exchanges . The median profit of 26 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was 11.5 billion rupees. Sales rose 8 percent to 105.9
billion rupees.  The company that also produces aluminum had to cut prices
following declines on the London Metal Exchange. Aluminum, used
to make products from aircraft to beverage cans, averaged 23
percent lower, while copper fell 14 percent in the last quarter
on the LME. The rupee fell 8.6 percent in the three months ended
June 30, the worst performance among Asian currencies, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  shares  of Sterlite fell 2.9 percent to 97.45 rupees at
close of trading in Mumbai, the lowest level in more than a
month. The stock has risen 8.6 percent this year, compared with
a 7.7 percent increase in the key Sensitive Index. The results
were announced after market hours.  Sterlite’s total expenses gained 21 percent to 90.8 billion
rupees in the period. The cost of power and fuel surged 14.5
percent to 11.2 billion rupees.  On July 20,  Hindustan Zinc Ltd. (HZ) , the nation’s largest
producer of the metal and a unit of Sterlite, reported a 6
percent gain in profit in the three months ending June 30. The
earnings were highest in five quarters and beat analyst
estimates.  Billionaire  Anil Agarwal , who owns the Vedanta group, plans
to combine its publicly traded Indian units Sterlite and  Sesa
Goa Ltd. (SESA) , the nation’s top iron ore exporter, into a new company,
the London-based company said on Feb. 25. Shareholders at Sesa
Goa and Sterlite approved the plan last month, Vedanta Resources
said in a statement on June 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
