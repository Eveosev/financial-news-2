U.S.  stocks  snapped four days of
losses and commodities rallied after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  pledged to preserve the euro. The 17-
nation currency strengthened against the dollar by the most in
almost a month.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.7 percent at 4
p.m. in New York for the biggest gain in almost two weeks.  S&P
500  futures added 0.1 percent as of 5:38 p.m. The  Stoxx Europe
600 Index (SXXP)  jumped 2.5 percent. The euro appreciated 1 percent to
$1.2282 as the dollar weakened against 15 of its 16 major peers.
The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials rose 0.2 percent and oil
advanced for a third day. Spain’s 10-year bond yield tumbled 45
basis points to 6.93 percent after reaching the highest in the
euro era yesterday.  Draghi suggested policy makers may intervene in bond
markets as surging yields in Spain and Italy threaten the
existence of the currency bloc. 3M Co., Visa Inc. and Sprint
Nextel Corp. gained after posting better-than-estimated
quarterly results.  Draghi “dampened some of the fears that something was
going to come apart imminently,” said  James Paulsen , the chief
investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management. His firm oversees about $320 billion. “He’s
basically saying there’s still a lot of will of the ECB
leadership to do whatever it takes to keep this thing
together.”  Euro Climbs  The euro rose as much as 1.4 percent, the most since June
29, after touching $1.2043 on July 24, the lowest since June
2010. The dollar was little changed at 78.21 yen and higher-
yielding currencies including the  New Zealand dollar 
strengthened most against their major peers.  Italy’s two-year note yield fell 88 basis points to 4.06
percent. Rates on Germany’s 10-year bonds climbed six basis
points to 1.32 percent, and yields on similar-maturity
Treasuries increased three basis points to 1.43 percent.  3M, the maker of products ranging from dental braces to
commercial sealants, rose 2.1 percent. Second-quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates as gains in efficiency helped trump a
drag from foreign-exchange rates.  Visa (V)  advanced 3.7 percent. The
company has benefited from a consumer shift from cash to
electronic payments that shows no signs of abating.  Sprint Nextel rallied 20 percent. Sales at the wireless
carrier were bolstered by customers spending more on data plans.
Zynga Inc., the biggest developer of games played on  Facebook (FB) 
Inc., plunged 37 percent on disappointing profit.  Facebook slumped 8.5 percent ahead of its first quarterly
results since selling shares to the public. After the market
closed, it tumbled 9.5 percent at 5:38 p.m. in New York as the
company posted a narrower profit margin amid surging costs.  Earnings Season  More than 60 companies in the S&P 500 reported results
today. Of the 278 index members to have  reported results  this
quarter, 72 percent have topped analysts’ projections, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 35,000 in
the week ended July 21 to 353,000, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists forecast 380,000 claims, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Bookings for goods meant
to last at least three years rose 1.6 percent for a second
month, a report from the Commerce Department showed. The median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
0.3 percent gain.  A gauge of U.S. speculative-grade corporate debt risk fell
the most in almost a month. The Markit CDX North America High
Yield Index, a credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge
against losses on high-yield debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell 15.8 basis points, the biggest drop since
June 29, to a mid-price of 597.1 basis points, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Sugar, Copper  Oil added 0.5 percent to $89.39 in New York. Copper
advanced 0.5 percent and gold rose 0.4 percent. Raw sugar fell
the most in more than four weeks in New York as dry weather at
top producer  Brazil  helped accelerate harvesting and boost
output this month.  European stocks rose for the first time in five days.
 Unilever (UNA) , the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker,
rallied 5.6 percent in Amsterdam as sales growth beat analysts’
estimates. Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, the world’s second-largest
maker of  aircraft engines , rose 6.7 percent as underlying pretax
profit topped forecasts.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc,  Europe ’s biggest oil company,
dropped 2.3 percent in  London  after reporting a bigger decline
than projected in second-quarter earnings. Siemens AG, the
region’s largest engineering company, slid 1.2 percent after
saying its full-year earnings goal has become harder to reach.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index added 1.3 percent.  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent, the lowest level
since March 2009 as speculation the government will maintain
real-estate curbs overshadowed a State Council plan to develop
the nation’s central provinces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
