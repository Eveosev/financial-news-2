Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the worldâ€™s
largest pulp maker, jumped the most in a month after reporting a
second-quarter net loss that was smaller than expected.  Shares rose 6 percent to 15.18 reais at 12:41 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo , the most since June 29. The Bovespa stock index advanced
0.6 percent.  The net loss was 524.3 million reais ($257.9 million), or
95 centavos a share, compared with a profit of 214.8 million
reais, or 27 centavos, a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Fibria
said in a statement today. The company was expected to report a
loss of 1.43 reais excluding some items, the average of five
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization increased to 37 percent of sales, from 34 percent a
year earlier, after Fibria reduced inventories and cut costs, it
said. Net sales rose 2.2, percent to 1.49 billion reais. The
cash cost of producing pulp, the raw material used to make
paper, declined 2 percent to 505 reais a ton in the period. Pulp
inventories fell 5.5 percent.  Fibria was formed after Votorantim Celulose & Papel SA took
over Aracruz Celulose SA in 2009 following $3 billion of
derivative losses. The company raised 1.44 billion reais in a
share offering in April to cut debt and reinforce its cash
position.
