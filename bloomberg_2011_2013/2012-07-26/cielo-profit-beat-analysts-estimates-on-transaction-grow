Cielo SA (CIEL3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest card-
payment processor, said second-quarter profit rose 30 percent on
increasing volume of transactions as it boosted market share.  Net income advanced to 549 million reais ($270 million)
from 424 million reais a year earlier, the Barueri, Brazil-based
company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. The average
estimate for profit excluding some items was 537 million reais,
according to a Bloomberg  survey  of 11 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Romulo de Mello Dias increased
market share as  Redecard SA (RDCD3) , the smaller rival that  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  is seeking to buy out, is focused on cutting
costs and increasing prices. Cielo ended the second quarter with
a market share of 61 percent in credit- and debit-card volume,
up from 60 percent in the previous three months and up from 58
percent a year earlier, according to the statement.  “Higher market share and earnings surprise were the main
reasons for our bullish view on Cielo since reporting first-
quarter,” Fabio Zagatti, Henrique Caldeira and Roberto Savaris,
Sao Paulo-based analysts at Barclays Plc, wrote in a report July
20.  The company’s total credit- and debit-card volume climbed
23 percent to 91.7 billion reais from a year earlier, it said in
the statement. Operating expenses reached 224 million reais, up
94 percent from a year earlier, led by increased spending on
marketing.  In February, Itau offered 35 reais a share, or 11.8 billion
reais, to buy the 49 percent of Redecard it doesn’t already own.  Cielo rose 0.2 percent to 62.64 reais in  Sao Paulo  trading
yesterday. The shares have gained 56 percent this year, the best
performance in the Bovespa benchmark  index , which has fallen 7.3
percent. Redecard fell 0.2 percent yesterday and the shares have
gained 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
