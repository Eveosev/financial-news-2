The yield on  Ghana ’s $750 million
Eurobond fell for a second day on the likelihood that President
John Dramani Mahama will maintain policies and projects put in
place by John Atta Mills, according to Eurasia Group.  Former Vice President Mahama was sworn in on July 24 after
Mills’ sudden death earlier in the day in Accra, the capital.  The yield on the 8.5 percent debt, due 2017, fell 11.6
basis points, or 0.116 percentage point, to 5.622 percent as of
12:33 p.m, the lowest since July 18, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Mahama’s “pro-investment positions are now out in the
forefront and are being viewed as a market positive,” James Clinton Francis, a sub-Saharan Africa researcher with Eurasia in
 Washington , said in an e-mailed comment today. “Mahama had been
working in the shadows of the Mills’ administration’s campaign
to attract foreign investment.”  The bond price rose 0.5 percent to 112.76 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
