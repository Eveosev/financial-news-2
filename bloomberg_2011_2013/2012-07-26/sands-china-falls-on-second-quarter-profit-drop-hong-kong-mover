Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Hong Kong-
listed unit of billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s Las Vegas company,
fell to the lowest level in seven months after it reported a 40
percent drop in second-quarter profit.  The stock fell 5 percent to close at HK$21.15 in Hong Kong
trading. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.08 percent.  Net income dropped to $160.5 million from $267.4 million a
year earlier on an impairment charge, lower winnings and opening
costs, according to a  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) ’s filing prepared in
U.S. GAAP standard. Growth is slowing in Macau, the world’s
largest gaming hub, as high-stake gamblers cut back spending
amid a weaker Chinese economy. Wynn Macau Ltd. this month
reported a drop in revenue for the second quarter.  Sands  China  booked an exceptional loss of $100.8 million
for the capital it spent on two plots of land in Macau.
Officials in the territory, the only place where casinos are
legal in China, in 2010 rejected the casino operator’s
application to develop the plots and the company last month
withdrew its appeal of that decision.  Revenue increased to $1.48 billion from $1.21 billion a
year earlier, according to the filing. Sands China opened the
first phase of its Cotai Central resort in April.  Slower Growth  Gambling revenue in Macau rose 7.3 percent in May, the
weakest pace since July 2009. While it increased 12.2 percent in
June to 23.3 billion patacas ($2.9 billion), it still lagged the
15.3 percent median estimate of four analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Sands China last week was given a three-year extension to
build its fifth property in Macau after Sands Macau, The
Venetian Macau, The Four Seasons Hotel Macau and Sands Cotai
Central. The company will pay a penalty of 900,000 patacas for
the delay in developing a plot called Parcel 3, where it will
build the newest resort.  Sands China plans to begin construction on Parcel 3 by
November, and the new project will target the mass-market and
feature “family-oriented” facilities, according to a press
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
