The euro may fall to levels between
$1.15 and $1.20 in September, according to Kit Juckes, head of
foreign-exchange research at  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA.  The 17-nation currency rallied today after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers will do whatever
is needed to preserve the euro. Juckes said he expects the euro
to trade at current levels through August before resuming
declines.  “The central bank is doing everything it can, the
challenge is with the politicians,” Juckes said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and
Sara Eisen. “What we need to solve is the crisis of financing
the banking system and the governments.”  The euro rose the most in almost a month, gaining as much
as 1.3 percent to $1.23 at 9:13 a.m. in New York. The shared
currency has fallen 5.1 percent this year against nine major
counterparts, according to the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The greenback has gained 0.7 percent this year.  Juckes said the  European debt crisis  still could “drag
confidence down” and send the U.S. back into recession.  “Your economy is doing much better than our economy,”
London-based Juckes said. “There’s nothing in the U.S. economy
that says you need to have another recession. We’re the
threat.”  The Federal Reserve will probably take more action this
year to boost the U.S. economy, Juckes said, adding central bank
beginning a third round of quantitative easing, known as QE3, is
a “question of time.”  “The Fed only has so many bullets left, but it will use
them,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
