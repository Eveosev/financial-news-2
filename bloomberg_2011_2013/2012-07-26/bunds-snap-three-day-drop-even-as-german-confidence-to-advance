Spanish government notes gained for
a second day amid speculation central banks will take additional
steps to spur growth and stem  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Italian  two-year securities  also advanced as the nation
sold its maximum target of 2.5 billion euros ($3 billion) at an
auction of zero-coupon debt.  Germany ’s  10-year bunds  rose for
the first time in four days even after an industry report
predicted  consumer confidence  in the nation will increase to a
five-month high in August.  “The possibility that a central-bank funded government
bond-buying program could at least get discussed will make
anyone who’s short peripheral markets very, very wary” and
support Spanish and Italian bonds, said  Peter Chatwell , a fixed-
income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
in  London . “It is unlikely that yields will come down in any
significant fashion.” A short position is a bet that an asset
will decline.  Spain’s two-year yield fell 23 basis points, or 0.23
percentage point, to 6.19 percent at 10:42 a.m. London time. The
4.75 percent note due in July 2014 rose 0.42, or 4.20 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 97.375. The yield dropped 47 basis
points yesterday.  Italy’s two-year note yield declined 16 basis points to
4.79 percent.  Spanish and Italian bonds advanced yesterday amid
speculation the  European Central Bank  will augment the firepower
of the region’s bailout fund to help contain contagion from the
debt crisis.  Home Sales  Sales of new U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped in June, the
Commerce Department said yesterday, fuelling speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will increase stimulus. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week policy makers are studying options for
further easing that may be deployed if economic growth remains
too weak to bring down unemployment.  Italy’s Treasury sold zero-coupon due in 2014 debt at a
yield of 4.86 percent, the highest since November and up from
4.712 percent at the previous auction on June 26. Investors bid
for 1.78 times the amount offered, versus 1.65 times last month.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield fell two basis points to 1.24
percent after dropping to match an all-time low of 1.127 percent
on July 23. The two-year note yield was little changed at minus
0.064 percent, below zero for a 15th day.  A German consumer-sentiment index will increase for a
second month to 5.9 from 5.8 in July, according to  GfK SE. (GFK) 
Economists predicted an unchanged reading, according to a
Bloomberg News  survey .  German debt returned 4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
lost 8.3 percent, while Italy’s bonds earned 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
