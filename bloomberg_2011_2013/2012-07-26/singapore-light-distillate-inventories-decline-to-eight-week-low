Light-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
to the lowest level in eight weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate declined 312,000 barrels, or 3.2 percent, to 9.34
million in the seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest since
the week ended May 30.  Middle-distillate inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene decreased 892,000 barrels, or 9.5 percent, to 8.46
million, the ministry’s data showed. Supplies shrank by the
biggest percentage in eight weeks.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels , including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, rose 234,000 barrels,
or 1.3 percent, to 17.6 million, according to the data. That’s
the first gain in three weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
