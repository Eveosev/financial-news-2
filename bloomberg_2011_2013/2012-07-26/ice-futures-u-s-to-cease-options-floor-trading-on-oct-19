Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (ICE) ’s  New
York  futures exchange plans to cease all floor trading in its
options contracts at the close of business on Oct. 19 as it
switches to electronic buying and selling exclusively.  “The exchange will continue to support access to the
electronic platform for exchange-member brokers and proprietary
traders from the floor facility,” the Atlanta-based company
said today in an e-mailed statement.  ICE Futures U.S. went to electronic-only trading for its
futures contracts in March 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
