Malaysia’s Prime Minister Najib Razak saw his approval rating in June hold steady at 64 percent
amid speculation that he would call an early election, a survey
by the Merdeka Center for Opinion Research showed.  The rating, which declined from 65 percent in May, remains
higher than the 59 percent approval he received last August,
according to the survey conducted between June 22 and June 29.
Economic issues rose in importance among the 1,010 voters in
Peninsular Malaysia who participated in the poll. The margin of
error was estimated at 3.08 percentage points.  Najib announced this month he would repeal legislation that
curbs free speech in the latest effort to scrap colonial-era
legislation before elections due by early next year. His
National Front coalition is fighting to hold onto power after
five decades of unbroken rule, having won re-election in 2008 by
its narrowest margin since independence.  Those saying they were “happy” with the government
declined by six percentage points from May to 42 percent, the
Merdeka poll showed.  The drop “may have less to do with politics or how they
perceive the prime minister but with how voters perceive the
economy is performing and its effect on their livelihood,” it
said in a statement accompanying the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
