The consumer watchdog in southern
China’s Guangdong province said  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s after-sale clauses
are unfair and violate Chinese laws and mobile-phone repair
rules, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing an investigation.  Customers have to agree that Apple repairers can use used
or reconditioned parts to replace damaged iPhone or iPad parts,
Xinhua said today, citing the results of the probe by
Guangdong’s consumer council.  Consumers also have to let Apple keep the replaced parts,
which are probably then reused to repair other devices, Xinhua
said, citing the results.  The council requested that Apple notify consumers in
written form that all parts used should be new, and should
provide new products or refunds if it fails to repair devices
twice while they’re under warranty, Xinhua said.  Carolyn Wu, a spokeswoman for Apple in  China , didn’t answer
calls to her office or mobile phones after normal business
hours, and didn’t immediately respond to e-mails.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
