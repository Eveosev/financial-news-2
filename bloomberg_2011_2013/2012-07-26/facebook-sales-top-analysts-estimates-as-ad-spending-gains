Facebook Inc. (FB)  fell in late trading
after its first earnings report as a public company showed a
slower sales gain and narrower profit margins, failing to allay
the concerns over growth that have sliced shares 29 percent.  Operating margin, excluding certain costs, was 43 percent
in the second quarter, a decline from 53 percent a year earlier,
amid a fourfold surge in sales and marketing expenses. Revenue
rose 32 percent, the slowest pace on record, and payments-
related sales were $192 million, below the $199.3 million
average prediction from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Facebook executives led by Chief Executive Officer  Mark
Zuckerberg , addressing analysts for the first time since the
company’s May 17 initial public offering, issued no growth
forecasts and said little else to reassure investors who fret
that the company is overvalued. The largest social network is
adding users faster than it can generate ad sales, the company
said, reiterating remarks it made on the cusp of the IPO.  “It has become a show-me story,” said Nabil Elsheshai, a
senior equity research analyst at Thrivent Financial. “The
problem is deceleration, and there wasn’t anything from an
outlook perspective that would indicate that is going to stop.”  Facebook shares slumped 12 percent to as low as $23.75
after the results were released. It had dropped 8.5 percent to
$26.85 by the close in  New York , and it’s down from $38 at the
IPO.  Expenses Surge  Sales increased to $1.18 billion,  Menlo Park , California-
based Facebook said in a statement today. That compares with an
average  estimate  of $1.16 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Monthly active users rose to 955 million, exceeding
the 950.1 million prediction by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The revenue increase was dwarfed by an increase in spending
on marketing and sales, which surged to $392 million. The
company reported a net loss of $157 million, or 8 cents a share,
and profit excluding certain costs of 12 cents a share.  Today’s report and conference call -- the mostly highly
anticipated earnings release since Google Inc.’s inaugural
figures in 2004 -- gave management its first chance since May to
make a case that Facebook deserves a higher price relative to
earnings than 98 percent of the  Standard & Poor’s 500 .  “A little bit of earnings guidance, a little bit of
optimism about future performance would have been nice,” said
 Jordan Rohan , analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in New York, who
has a hold  rating  on Facebook. “Facebook trades at a premium to
many companies, including Google, and is only growing at a
slightly faster pace than companies like Google.”  Twitter, Google  Shareholders sought assurances that the company can keep
users engaged amid rising competition from Twitter Inc. and
Google and that it can overcome challenges making money from
advertising on mobile devices.  Facebook said in May that sales growth wasn’t keeping pace
with user expansion as more members accessed the service with
mobile phones. The number of ads delivered in the U.S. in the
second quarter decreased 2 percent even as the number of daily
users increased 10 percent, Chief Financial Officer  David Ebersman  said on the conference call.  “Ad impressions continued the recent trend of growing more
slowly than users as more of our usage is on mobile devices,”
Ebersman said. “This trend is particularly true in markets such
as the U.S., where smartphone use is expanding rapidly.”  Facebook has had little time to gain traction in mobile
advertising, having just announced its inaugural mobile-
advertising platform in February.  Mobile Challenges  Zuckerberg, who gave opening remarks on the call, said
mobile is a key area of focus for the company. Mobile users, who
make up more than half of the membership, are more active than
counterparts who use only the desktop version, he said.  “Mobile is a huge opportunity for Facebook,” Zuckerberg
said. “Our goal is to connect everyone in the world. And over
the next five years, we expect 4 or 5 billion people to have
smartphones. That’s more than twice as many people as have
computers today.”  Early results on mobile ads show some promise, according to
AdParlor, which provides services for marketers. Click-through
rates are 15 times higher on mobile than on desktops, while the
pricing is 30 percent less, according to  AdParlor .  Owing to the success of new services, Facebook should boost
both mobile and desktop advertising revenue in the future, Chief
Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg  said on the call. Still, the
company must educate companies about how they should advertise
on a social service, still a relatively new avenue for
marketers, she said.  Like TV  “It took a long time for the TV market and advertising to
be truly understood, it took a long time for search, and I think
we’re still in that learning curve with a lot of our clients,”
Sandberg said. “If our ads work, and we continue to make our
ads work and they work for advertisers and our users, we’ll be
able to educate the market over time.”  Facebook raised $16 billion in the May 17 IPO, the largest
ever for a technology company. Yet its debut was marred by
technical glitches, and the stock only managed to close above
$38 on the first day of trading. The company had first proposed
a price range of $28 to $35 before raising it to $34 to $38 just
days before the IPO.  Facebook derives most of its revenue from ads that reach
users as they post comments, embed videos or check photos
uploaded to the site by friends. The company also makes money
when users pay for digital items, including on games made by
 Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  Facebook shares were weighed down earlier today after
Zynga announced earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Progress Made  Facebook is making progress in some areas, including online
display advertising, which includes photos and other graphical
elements. Facebook will have 16.8 percent of the U.S. market
this year, after grabbing the top spot from Yahoo! Inc. last
year,  according  to EMarketer Inc. in New York. Google will have
16.5 percent, up from 13.8 percent last year and Yahoo’s share
will be 9.1 percent, down from 10.8 percent.  Users are also spending more time on the service. Average
time spent online increased 5.1 percent in June to 400.2
minutes, or more than six-and-a-half hours, after a gain of less
than 1 percent the previous month in the U.S., according to
researcher  ComScore Inc. (SCOR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
