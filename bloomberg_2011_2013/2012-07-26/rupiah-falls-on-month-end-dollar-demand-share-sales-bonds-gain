Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a fourth
day on speculation importers are buying dollars to settle month-
end bills and after global funds cut share holdings.  Government
bonds  gained.  Overseas investors sold $98 million more local stocks than
they purchased in the first three days of this week, exchange
data show. The Jakarta Composite Index reached 4,108.67 last
week, the highest level since May. The rupiah touched 9,526
against the dollar yesterday, the weakest level since June 25.  “The rupiah is pressured by month-end demand for
dollars,” said Bayu Kurniawan, a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange
trader at PT Bank Ekonomi Raharja, a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc.
“Indonesia’s stocks may be seen as expensive after reaching
beyond the 4,000 level and investors are likely to be cautious
on earnings.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,493 per dollar as of
3:51 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 8 percent.  Global funds bought a net 2.24 trillion rupiah ($236
million) of local  government bonds  in the first three days of
this week, finance ministry data show. Foreign holdings reached
235.9 trillion rupiah on July 24, the highest since Feb. 13.  The yield on the benchmark 7 percent notes due May 2022
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.81
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
