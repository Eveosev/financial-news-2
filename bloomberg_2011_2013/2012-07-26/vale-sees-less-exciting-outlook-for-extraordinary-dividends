     July 26 (Bloomberg) -- Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-ore
miner, headed towards the longest losing streak in 17 years
after profit fell more than forecast on slumping iron-ore
prices, dimming chances of an extraordinary dividend payment.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  dropped  1.3 percent to 34.68
reais at 2:22 p.m. in  Sao Paulo . A close at the level would be
the lowest since Sept. 14, 2009, and a 10-day losing streak the
longest since February 1995. The Brazilian benchmark Bovespa
Index  rose  1.5 percent.  Vale said yesterday that second-quarter net income slumped
59 percent to $2.66 billion, or 52 cents a share, missing a per-
share profit estimate of 73 cents excluding some items in a
Bloomberg survey. Vale sees a “less exciting” outlook for
extraordinary dividends this year, Chief Executive Officer
Murilo Ferreira told analysts today on a conference call.  “We had a pretty strong year last year, we would like to
establish the same this year but with the scenario we are
working with, that won’t be possible,” he said. “We continue
focusing on a very reasonable dividend policy and we should
announce the 2013 dividend in the last quarter.”  Vale last year paid a record $9 billion to shareholders,
more than double its initial target, and bought back $3 billion
worth of stock after investment fell short of initial plans. The
company said on Jan. 16 said it will pay at least $6 billion of
dividends this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
