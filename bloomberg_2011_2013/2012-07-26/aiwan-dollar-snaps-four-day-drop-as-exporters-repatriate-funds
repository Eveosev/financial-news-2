Taiwan’s dollar rose on speculation
exporters are taking advantage of a four-day loss to convert
overseas earnings at a more favorable  exchange rate  as the
month-end approaches.  Government bonds  were little changed.  The currency earlier touched NT$30.24 against its U.S.
counterpart, the weakest level in almost seven months, after
global funds sold $123 million more local stocks than they
bought, taking net sales this year to $3.1 billion, according to
exchange data. A report yesterday showed demand for new U.S.
homes unexpectedly dropped in June from a two-year high, fueling
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take more steps to spur
economic growth.  “Some exporters are selling the greenback,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“The Taiwan dollar will remain weak unless the Fed really
pushes out a new round of bond buying.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$30.15,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, climbed
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.25 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
little changed at 1.129 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market.  The  overnight money-market rate  was steady at 0.386
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
