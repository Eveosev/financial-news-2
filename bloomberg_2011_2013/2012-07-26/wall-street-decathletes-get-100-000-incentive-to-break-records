Jason Price, a former All-American
college sprinter, and his more than 100 rivals have a $100,000
incentive to run the fastest 400 meters in the four-year history
of the  Wall Street   Decathlon .  Scott Stuart, the co-founder of  Sageview Capital LP , will
donate that amount to New York’s  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center  if the record of 54.63 seconds for the event is broken on
July 29 at  Columbia University  in New York.  “It got me motivated to get back in that close-to-race
shape,” said Price, a 24-year-old prime brokerage sales analyst
for  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  who competed for the  University of
Southern California ’s track and field team from 2006 to 2010 and
was a captain as a junior and senior.  Finance executives have promised donations of more than
$25,000 each if traders, bankers and advisers competing for the
unofficial title of Wall Street’s best all-around athlete can
beat certain records or reach preset benchmarks in the 10-
discipline competition.  Price was a two-time All-American as part of USC’s 1,600-
meter relay team. His record for 400 meters is under 50 seconds
and he still runs regularly.  Price, who lives in the financial district in  Manhattan ,
said he trains in Central Park and on paths along the  West Side
Highway  in addition to doing occasional track workouts.  ‘Help People’  “I’m confident I can beat the record, but I don’t
necessarily want to put a time on it,” Price said in a
telephone interview. “I do stay in pretty good shape and one of
my passions is running and competing. This gives me a chance to
help people and to further my passion.”  Others aiming for the 400-meter record set by Adam Shada of
 Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc., a former cornerback for the University
of  Iowa ’s football team, include former Princeton University
400-meter runner  Jim Murphy  of Swap Financial Group LLC and two-
time University of Florida track All-American Steve Zieminski of
 RBC Capital Markets .  Stuart, whose Sageview associate  Kyle Peterson  won the
first Wall Street Decathlon in 2009, has the biggest of the so-
called charity bets at this year’s event. If the record in the
400 meters doesn’t fall, he’ll donate $50,000 to the cancer
center.  “I’m going to be happy to give $100,000,” Stuart said in
a phone interview from his office in Greenwich,  Connecticut .
“The odds are high that they’ll blow through the record, which
is great. That’s what it’s all about. It’s a great strategy and
a great cause.”  Charity Bets  Mark Standish, the co-chief executive officer of event
title sponsor RBC Capital Markets, has placed charity bets that
collectively top $25,000.  He’s wagering all of Wall Street that RBC wins the title in
the new team competition, in which three participants per
company split up the 10 events. Standish will make an additional
donation if the 800-meter record of 2 minutes, 14 seconds falls.  RBC and its employees who are taking part in the decathlon
have collected $316,225 in charitable pledges. Goldman Sachs is
second, with $76,468 in promised donations, followed by Knight
Capital Group Inc. at $25,973, according to the event website.
To date, pledges totaling $1.06 million have been received.  Peter Weinberg , the founding partner of Perella Weinberg
Partners, is also among donors who have made performance-based
pledges in excess of $25,000.  Online Donations  Anyone can place their own charity bet for any amount. At
the  decathlon’s website , donors can lay bets for charity on
whether Justin Nunez, who is at  PAMLI Capital Management LLC 
after leaving Goldman Sachs, will repeat as overall champion, or
if anyone can beat 4.5 seconds in the 40-yard dash.  Brian Kuritzky of Goldman Sachs, a former Cornell
University soccer player, received a $10,000 charity bet that
pays off if he can run the 800 meters in under 2:14.  Decathlon co-organizer Dave Maloney said 100 percent of all
donations go to the cancer center, with a goal of $1.5 million,
about three times the amount raised in 2011.  “You might not have a connection to an athlete, but you
may be interested in a certain event and the cause, and this is
another impetus for you to donate,” Maloney said by telephone.  The 40-yard dash and 400 and 800 meters are where
similarities to the decathlon at the London Olympics end.  Pull-ups, a football throw, an agility drill, rowing, a
vertical jump, bench press and dips -- a triceps exercise using
one’s own weight -- make up the remainder of the one-day contest.  Awards are presented to the top three finishers as well as
the top executive performer, the winners in three age groups
(under 30, 30-39 and over 40), the top fundraiser and the top
team.  “On Wall Street, you have a lot of very competitive men
and women,” Sageview’s Stuart said. “The idea that they can
compete in an event like this and also know that they’re raising
some significant money for pediatric cancer, that just seems
like a great idea all the way around.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
