Light SA (LIGT3) , a Brazilian power utility,
expects demand for its energy-efficiency services to double next
year as electricity prices rise and more supermalls and
factories seek to conserve power.  Light expects to complete as many as 40 energy-efficiency
projects for customers in 2013, up from 20 this year and 10 in
2010, Marco Antonio Donatelli, director of the company’s energy-
efficiency unit  Light Esco , said in a telephone interview
yesterday. These include installing rooftop solar panels and
modern air-conditioning units  Light Esco is able to cut shopping malls’ power usage as
much as 40 percent and factories’ consumption by 15 percent with
more efficient power systems, he said. The country was  ranked
 10th for  energy-efficiency  among the world’s 12 biggest
economies by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient
Economy, before  Canada  and Russia.  “There’s massive potential for energy efficiency
throughout the world, but particularly in  Brazil , where so few
possibilities have been exploited,” Donatelli said. “We now
have five companies approaching us a month for projects. Last
year it was about two or three.”  Light Esco, based in  Rio de Janeiro , is working on eight
projects now, including a 2,380 square meter (25,600 square
foot) solar system atop the city’s Maracana sports stadium and a
60 million-real ($30 million) natural gas-fired co-generation
plant at a soft-drink factory, he said.  The company invested 126.1 million reais in efficiency
projects from 2009 to 2011, according to last year’s
sustainability  report .  Distributors sold power to industry at an average price of
248.05 reais a megawatt hour last year, up from 131.59 reais in
2003, the Brasilia-based electricity regulator Agencia Nacional
de Energia Eletrica said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
