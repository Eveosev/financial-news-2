Egyptian Prime Minister-designate
Hisham Qandil said he expects his new government to be unveiled
by July 28 at the latest, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported.  The outgoing government will perform its duties until the
new cabinet is formed, MENA cited Qandil as saying.  The appointment of the little-known Qandil two days ago by
President Mohamed Mursi as prime minister prompted criticism
from some secular groups that Qandil fell short of the national-
unit figure the president had pledged to name to steer the
country forward. None of the names of potential cabinet members
circulating in the local press are well-known to the public.  There are no disputes between Mursi and the formerly ruling
Supreme Council for Armed Forces over the defense portfolio,
Mursi’s spokesman, Yasser Ali, said according to MENA. The
council met to “review and study the affairs involving the
armed forces,” the news agency reported.  The presidential team comprising Mursi’s vice presidents
and assistants will be announced “within hours,” Ali was cited
by MENA as saying. Mursi had vowed during his electoral campaign
to appoint a female and a Coptic as deputies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
