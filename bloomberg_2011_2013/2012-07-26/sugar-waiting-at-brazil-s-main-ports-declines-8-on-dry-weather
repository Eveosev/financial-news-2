The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at the main ports in  Brazil , the world’s largest
producer, fell 8 percent in the past week as dry weather helped
loading, data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda. show.  The amount was 2.8 million metric tons of sugar ready for
loading yesterday at Recife, Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos,
according to the shipping agency based in Recife, Brazil. That
was down from 3.04 million tons a week earlier. Brazil’s center
south, the main growing region, got mostly dry weather in the 10
days to July 24, Marco Antonio dos Santos, a weather forecaster
at Somar Meteorologia in  Sao Paulo , said in a report that day.  “Weather forecasts currently indicate average to below
average rainfall in Brazil’s centre south over the next 10
days,”  Paul Deane , an economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in a report e-mailed
today. It could help ease “near-term supply concerns.”  Above average rainfall in May and June delayed the
harvest and shipments from Brazil. Sugar output in the center
south was down 22 percent from the start of the harvest through
to July 15, industry group Unica said yesterday.  About 24 percent of all the sugar waiting at ports, or
675,750 tons, was scheduled to go to China, the second-biggest
global consumer of sugar after  India . China is forecast to
import 3.1 million tons of the sweetener in the 2011-12 season
begun in October, 1 million tons more than a year earlier, the
 International Sugar Organization  in  London  estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
