U.S. Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin
will be competing at the London Games to bring pride to her home
state of  Colorado  after 12 people were shot to death last week
in the town where she trains and attends high school.  The shootings at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, on
July 20 also left 58 people wounded. James Holmes, a 24-year-old
graduate student being held in the case, allegedly carried out
the attack with a semi-automatic rifle, a shotgun and a handgun.  “All I have to do is, do what I can here and swim my heart
out and hopefully make my state proud,” Franklin, a 17-year-old
student at Regis Jesuit High School, said at a news conference
today at Olympic Park. “Give a little bit of fun for this
really tough summer that Colorado has had.”  Franklin said she learned of the shootings on Twitter while
training in  France .  “It’s absolutely horrible, it was just so senseless and
you have to wonder why these things happen in the world,” said
Franklin, who lives in Centennial, Colorado. Centennial and
Aurora are suburbs of Denver.  Franklin will be competing in seven events at the Olympics,
the most a U.S. female swimmer has ever tried. She won five
medals, including three golds, at last year’s world
championships in  Shanghai  and set a national record in the 100-
meter backstroke of 58.85 seconds at last month’s U.S. swimming
trials.  The London Games’ opening ceremony is tomorrow. Franklin is
participating in seven events in what will be her first
Olympics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
