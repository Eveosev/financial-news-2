Thailand ’s baht gained for a second
day on speculation exporters will convert overseas profits
toward the end of the month.  Government bonds  rose after the
central bank signaled it has room to cut borrowing costs.  Asian currencies climbed as the  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia-Pacific Index of
shares snapped a four-day loss after a drop in U.S. new home
sales fueled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will take steps to
spur growth. The Bank of Thailand held its benchmark interest
 rate  unchanged at 3 percent yesterday and said it is ready to do
more to support the economy if risks escalate.  “Demand from exporters is supporting the baht,” said Kozo
Hasegawa, a Bangkok-based currency trader at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp. “With fragile external conditions and potential
rate cut or at least no prospect of rate increase, the
environment is supportive for the bonds.”  The baht added 0.1 percent to 31.66 per dollar as of 3:01
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its
one-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was unchanged at 5.02 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.13 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
