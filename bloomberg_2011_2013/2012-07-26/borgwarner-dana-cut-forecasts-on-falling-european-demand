BorgWarner Inc. (BWA) , which makes
turbochargers, and  Dana Holding Corp. (DAN) , a maker of axles for
cars, trucks and construction equipment, lowered their forecasts
for annual sales and profit because of the economic slowdown in
Europe and other markets.  The revised forecasts reflect the financial difficulties
their customers having in Europe, headed for its fifth-straight
year of declining sales. Automakers, including  General Motors
Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F) , are struggling to cut losses in the
region.  “Our gut instinct is that the auto names overall are
unlikely to gain traction until the European overhang eases at
least modestly,”  Peter Nesvold , an analyst with Jefferies &
Co., wrote in a research note today about BorgWarner.  Dana, based in Maumee,  Ohio , said profit this year will be
$1.94 to $2.01 a share, compared with a forecast of as much as
$2.05 that it reaffirmed on April 25. The average estimate of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of $1.89. Dana,
in a statement, cited “softening production demand in certain
end markets” for its lower forecast.  BorgWarner said profit this year would be $5.05 to $5.25 a
share, compared with a January forecast of as much as $5.65,
because of “weakening global economic conditions.” The average
estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit
of $5.35. Sales will rise 4 percent to 6 percent, compared with
an earlier forecast of as much as 12 percent, according to a
statement.  ‘Negatively Impacted’  “Our outlook for  Europe  and for commercial vehicle markets
around the world has been negatively impacted by the general
slowdown in the global economy,” Tim Manganello, BorgWarner’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  BorgWarner’s profit in the three months ended June 30 fell
26 percent to $120.6 million, or $1 a share, from $162 million
or $1.31 a share. Sales rose 2.1 percent to $1.86 billion,
compared with $1.96 billion, the average of 14 analysts’
estimates. Excluding some costs and charges, profit was $1.36 a
share. On that basis, 21 analysts in a Bloomberg survey
estimated $1.37 a share.  Dana reported a 26 percent increase in profit to $86
million from $68 million, while adjusted earnings per share rose
to 56 cents a share from 45 cents. The average of 14 estimates
was for a profit of 51 cents. Sales rose less than 0.1 percent
to $1.95 billion, compared with $2 billion, the average of 10
estimates.  Dana surged as much as 13 percent, the biggest intraday
gain in 11 months. Shares rose 12 percent to $12.70 at 10:14
a.m. in New York. BorgWarner, based in  Auburn Hills ,  Michigan ,
gained 2 percent to $63.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
