Jordan has stockpiles of wheat large
enough to last for 10 months, according to the Ministry of
Industry and Trade.  “Jordan’s current wheat reserve is sufficient for 10
months,” ministry spokesman Yanal Barmawi said in a telephone
interview in Amman today. “We are not in a hurry to buy. We
want to receive more offers and monitor the developments in the
grains markets globally.”  Wheat has surged 43 percent since June 15 in Chicago
trading as a drought in the U.S. Midwest hurt crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
