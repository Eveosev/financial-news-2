Swap contracts fell for lower-
quality thermal coal from Indonesia, the world’s biggest
exporter of the fuel, declining for a fourth day, according to
Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte. Contracts for shipments to  China 
also dropped.  The swap for sub-bituminous coal with a calorific value of
4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from Indonesia in the
fourth quarter fell 25 cents yesterday to $62.60 a metric ton on
a net-as-received basis, the energy broker said in an e-mail
today. The August contract was 10 cents higher at $60.50 on a
net-as-received basis.  The swap for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for delivery to South China in the
fourth quarter slid 40 cents to $84.10 a ton on a net-as-
received basis, Ginga said. The August contract fell 40 cents to
$82.20 on a net-as-received basis.  The price of thermal coal at Australian port of Newcastle
declined $4.10 to $81.15 a ton in week ended July 20, according
to IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield, U.K.-based provider of coal
data. That was the second week of declines and the lowest since
week ended Dec. 11, 2009  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of  Indonesia ’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
