Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) , the U.S. military’s
biggest supplier of blast-resistant trucks, rose the most in
almost three years after reporting third-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates and raising its full-year forecast.  Shares of Oshkosh, based in the Wisconsin city of the same
name, rose 15 percent to $22.63 in  New York  trading. It was the
biggest increase since Aug. 27, 2009.  Oshkosh today reported third-quarter profit from continuing
operations of 75 cents a share, compared with analysts’
 estimates  of 54 cents a share.  Sales of access, or construction, equipment helped boost
the company’s performance in the quarter.  “Margin improvement was particularly strong in the access
equipment and commercial segments due in part to our continuing
efforts to reduce our product, process and overhead costs,”
Chief Executive Officer Charles Szews said in a statement.  The company said it expects sales in the segment will be 40
percent higher in fiscal 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
