Enerjisa Enerji Uretim AS, a Turkish
electricity provider owned by Vienna-based  Verbund AG (VER)  and
 Turkey ’s  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , has signed an agreement
for a 750 million-euro ($909 million) loan.  The Istanbul-based Enerjisa will use the facility to help
finance the development of the 450 megawatt lignite-fired
Tufanbeyli  power plant  and the associated mine, near the
southern city of Adana, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today. Enerjisa will generate electricity in the plant
to sell in the free market, without a purchase guarantee, the
company said.  “We invest in local resources to meet the increasing
energy needs of Turkey,” Selahattin Hakman, President of
Sabanci’s energy group, said. “This investment also shows our
confidence in a free market based on competition.”  Korea Trade Insurance Corp has insured a large part of the
loan, Enerjisa said.  Societe Generale , HSBC Bank Plc, Raffeisen
Bank International AG and  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  are among the
creditors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
