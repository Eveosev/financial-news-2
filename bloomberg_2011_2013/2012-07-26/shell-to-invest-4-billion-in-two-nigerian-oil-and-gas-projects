Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , operator of
Nigeria’s largest oil fields, agreed to invest about $4 billion
with its partners in two oil and gas projects in the country.  The Shell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria, which Shell
operates as a venture with  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Total SA (FP)  and the government,
will develop the Forcados-Yokri project and the Southern Swamp
associated gas gathering project, the company said today in a
statement. The projects are expected to pump 100,000 barrels and
85,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day at peak, respectively.  Southern Swamp will “collect gas, reduce flaring, while
there is associated oil production and it will produce gas for
domestic use for power,” Chief Financial Officer Simon Henry
told reporters today in London. Both of the  projects  “are very
strategic” for  Nigeria . The Forcados-Yokri fields are located
in shallow waters in the west of the country.  Shell, based in The Hague, last month said it planned to
invest about $3.5 billion in a natural-gas project in Imo state
in the southeast. It is working on 17 gas projects in Nigeria,
set to cost a total of  $6 billion , according to the company.  Shell is still looking for buyers for its two oil and gas
exploration licenses in the African nation. The company has
already found investors for four permits in its effort to reduce
its geographical spread across Nigeria, Henry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
