Dassault Aviation SA (AM) , the maker of
Rafale fighter planes and Falcon business jets, posted a 91
percent jump in first-half profit on higher deliveries of
corporate aircraft.  Net income, excluding Dassault’s holding in  Thales SA (HO) , rose
to 179 million euros from 94 million euros in the year-earlier
period, the French company said in a statement. Including the
stake, net income rose 74 percent to 223 million euros. Sales
rose 46 percent to 1.93 billion euros from 1.3 billion euros.  Dassault, based in Saint Cloud, a suburb of Paris, has
relied increasingly on corporate jets for earnings in recent
years as military sales have slowed with amid failure to find
export customers for its Rafale. Dassault earlier this year was
chosen as exclusive bidder to supply  India  with 60 fighter jets
though it must successfully negotiate price and terms before it
can declare victory on the contract.  In the first half, the company sold 34 Falcon business
jets, up from 19 in the year-earlier period. The number of
Rafales sold fell to four from six.  Dassault said it expects to deliver 65 Falcons and 11
Rafales this year. It sold a record 95 business jets in 2010.  The company sees net sales this year matching those last
year. Dassault sees Europe’s economic crisis hurting the  defense
budget  in  France , its main customer for fighter jets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
