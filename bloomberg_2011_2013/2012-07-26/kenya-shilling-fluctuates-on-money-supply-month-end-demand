Kenya ’s shilling swung between gains
and losses as businesses sought more dollars to settle month-end
bills while the central bank removed money supply from the
market through repurchase agreements.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy traded less
than 0.1 percent stronger at 84.34 per dollar as of 5:52 p.m. in
Nairobi, after gaining as much as 1.3 percent and weakening as
much as 0.7 percent.  “The Kenyan shilling held steady against the  U.S. dollar 
as
the central bank mopped liquidity and the scheduled debt
auctions
provided further support,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in
a
note to clients today.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted 900 million shillings
($10.7 million) in seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a yield of
12.369 percent, according to a bank official, who asked not to
be identified in line with policy. The bank accepted 100 million
shillings of 14- and 28-day term-auction deposits at a weighted
average rate of 12.05 percent, he said.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened as much as 0.3 percent to
1,584 a dollar, while the Uganda shilling traded unchanged at
2,480 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
