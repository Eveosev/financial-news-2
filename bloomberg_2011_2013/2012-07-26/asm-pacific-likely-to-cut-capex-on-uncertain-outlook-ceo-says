ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. (522) , the
world’s biggest maker of chip-assembly and packaging equipment,
will likely cut its capital expenditure as Europe’s debt crisis
crimps demand.  “It’s very likely that our annual capital expenditure will
not meet our budget,” Lee Wai Kwong, chief executive officer of
the Hong Kong-based company, said at a press conference today.
“Because the euro debt crisis is so uncertain, we’ll also be
more cautious with our financial management.”  The manufacturer has forecast spending of $101.3 million
this year, down 2 percent from actual investment in 2011,
according to its annual report released in March. That would be
the lowest spending since $14.2 million in 2009, the document
shows.  Chip manufacturers are facing weakening demand amid a
global economic slowdown.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
semiconductor maker, scaled back its annual sales forecast this
month as demand for personal computers fails to rebound in
Europe and the U.S.  STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s largest
chipmaker, also announced a 25 percent cut in capital
expenditure for the year this week.  ASM Pacific’s second-quarter sales fell 26 percent to
HK$2.93 billion ($378 million) from the same period last year,
according to earnings published today. Net income dropped 60
percent to HK$310 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
