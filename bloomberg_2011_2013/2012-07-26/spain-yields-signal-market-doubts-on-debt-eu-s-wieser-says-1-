Surging Spanish bond yields suggest
that investors doubt the country’s debt sustainability, euro-
area official  Thomas Wieser  said.  “Under all possible scenarios of debt sustainability
analysis, Spain can be expected to easily, without any problem,
stay current on its obligations,” Wieser, head of the group
that prepares meetings of euro-area finance ministers, said
today in an interview with  Guy Johnson  on Bloomberg Television’s
“The Pulse.” “But that’s not what markets are telling us.”  Yields on Spain’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year government
securities climbed to euro-era records this week amid
speculation that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will have to seek
a bailout to backstop the country’s regions and its banks.  “There is additional concern out there,” Wieser said from
Brussels. “Part of this concern may be of a rational nature,
part of this concern may be overshooting.”  Spain requested 100 billion euros ($122 billion) of
international aid for its banks last month, becoming the fourth
nation in the euro-region to seek assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
