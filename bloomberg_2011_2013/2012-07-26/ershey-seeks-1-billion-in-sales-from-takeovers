Hershey Co. (HSY)  Chief Executive Officer
John P. Bilbrey said he may need to generate $1 billion in
annual revenue from acquisitions to reach his goal of $10
billion in sales within five years.  “Our current strategic plan actually gets us somewhere
above $9 billion,” Bilbrey said today in a telephone interview.
“In that model, you would need to add about $1 billion in M&A
growth.”  Bilbrey plans to reach $10 billion in revenue by the end of
2017. He looks to surpass Mars Inc. to become the largest
confectionery maker in  North America , while increasing
international sales an average of 20 percent a year. Hershey,
based in the Pennsylvania community of the same name, had sales
of $6.1 billion last year.  Hershey is looking to build distribution in emerging
economies such as China,  Brazil , India and Southeast Asia, where
it can sell chocolate, mints and candy to growing middle-class
populations. The company has said there is $30 billion of
potential acquisitions in the highly fragmented global
confection and snack market.  Hershey rose 1.2 percent to $71.18 at 11:25 a.m. in  New
York . The shares climbed 14 percent this year through yesterday.  The company reported second-quarter profit excluding some
items of 66 cents a share today, surpassing the 61-cent average
of 10 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
