Vietnam ’s two-year bonds climbed for
a seventh day, driving yields to the lowest level in more than
two weeks, on speculation slowing inflation will increase room
for interest-rate cuts. The dong was little changed.  The pace of consumer- price  gains dropped to a 32 month-low
of 5.35 percent in July, the General Statistics Office said on
July 24. The  overnight interbank deposit rate  fell 66 basis
points, or 0.66 percentage point, to 2.56 percent, the least
since June 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The low inflation rate means that interest rates will
probably go down further to boost the economy,” said Do Hoang Quynh Trang, a fixed-income trader at Hanoi-based  Ocean
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank . “Bond yields will follow the
downtrend in market  interest rates .”  The yield on two-year notes fell three basis points to 9.5
percent, the lowest level since July 9, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,883 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since
Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
