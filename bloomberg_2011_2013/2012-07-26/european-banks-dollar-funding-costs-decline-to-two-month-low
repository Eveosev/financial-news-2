The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars dropped to the lowest in more than two months,
according to a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 43 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 10:25 a.m. in
London from 44 yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
cost is the cheapest since May 7.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 51 basis
points, or 0.51 percentage point, below Euribor. Three-month
Euribor, the rate  banks  say they see each other lending in
euros, was set at a record low 0.422 percent today.  The euro overnight indexed average, Eonia, was set at 11.4
basis points yesterday from a record low 11.3 the day before. An
estimate of overnight borrowing costs over the next three
months, the Eonia OIS swap, was 9.8 basis points from 9.4
yesterday.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, placing 337 billion euros ($409 billion) from 324
billion euros on July 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
