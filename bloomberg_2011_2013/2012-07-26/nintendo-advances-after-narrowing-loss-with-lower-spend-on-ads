Nintendo Co., the world’s largest
maker of video-game machines, rose the most in a month in Osaka
trading after the company narrowed its first-quarter loss on
lower advertisement costs.  The shares  rose as much as 3.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since June 21, to 8,420 yen as of 9:29 a.m. That
cut the Kyoto-based company’s year-to-date loss to 21 percent.  Nintendo narrowed the net loss to 17.2 billion yen ($220
million) in the three months ended June 30 from 25.5 billion yen
a year earlier. The creator of the Mario character cut
advertisement and promotion costs by half to 10 billion yen in
the first quarter before introducing the 3DS XL handheld player
equipped with larger screens on July 28 in  Japan .  The earnings were “slightly positive,” Shunsuke Tsuchiya,
a Tokyo-based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a note
to clients. Nintendo may be able to report an operating profit
in the current period, he said.  First-quarter sales fell 9.7 percent to 84.8 billion yen,
while Nintendo’s operating loss narrowed to 10.3 billion yen
from 37.7 billion yen. The 3DS will be profitable starting this
month, said  Yasuhiro Minagawa , a spokesman.  Nintendo also retained its full-year sales target for the
3DS, which beams images in 3-D, at 18.5 million units and the
Wii and Wii U consoles at 10.5 million units. The company is
counting on the portable player and Wii U home console to
recover from its first annual loss last fiscal year since it
went public in 1962.  To contact the reporter on this story:
