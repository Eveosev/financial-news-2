Manchester City captain  Vincent Kompany  signed a new six-year contract that the Premier League
soccer champion said is the longest agreement in the club’s
recent history.  The central defender, who’s made 169 appearances for City
since joining from Hamburg in 2008, led the club to its first
English league championship in 44 years last season.  “For me, if you are good somewhere then there is no reason
to look elsewhere,” Kompany, 26, said on  City’s website . “Man
City as a project is not just a project of the owners or the
people employed by the club; it is also my project.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
