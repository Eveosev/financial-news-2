Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s third-biggest
mining company by market value, said it’s considering bringing
in a partner for a $6 billion potash project in Argentina.  “The profile we are looking for is a partner that would be
strategic, that would bring value to the project and that would
be willing to share risk with us,”  Roger Downey , head of Vale’s
fertilizers and coal business, said in a conference call today.  Vale Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira signed
agreements with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner on July 19 to proceed with Rio Colorado. The project
will make Argentina the world’s third-largest potash exporter,
Fernandez said at the signing ceremony.  At the time Fernandez said Vale and  YPF SA (YPFD) , the oil and gas
company she nationalized in April, are working together on shale
gas and electricity generation projects, according to a copy of
her speech published on the  presidential website .  A YPF spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment left
by telephone and e-mail. Fernandez’s spokesman Alfredo
Scocimarro wasn’t immediately available to speak, an assistant
said by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
