International Paper Co. (IP) , the world’s
largest maker of cardboard shipping containers, said it’s
confident a $50-a-ton increase in U.S. containerboard and box
prices will be accepted by buyers.  “Operating rates are high, inventories are low, export
demand is fairly solid, the supply side of the containerboard
market is fairly tight,” Chief Executive Officer John Faraci
said today in a telephone interview. “Prices have been stable
for two years.”  The  Memphis , Tennessee-based company plans to raise
containerboard prices effective Aug. 1 and boost cardboard-box
prices in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
