Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest
U.S. gold producer, reported second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as costs were higher and production declined
more than projected.  Net income  fell 28 percent to $279 million, or 56 cents a
share, from $387 million, or 77 cents, a year earlier,  Greenwood
Village , Colorado-based Newmont said yesterday in a statement.
Profit excluding one-time items was 59 cents a share, less than
the 93-cent average of 16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
declined 6.5 percent to $2.23 billion, trailing the $2.47
billion average of six estimates.  Newmont’s so-called cost attributable to gold sales was
$681 an ounce, compared with $583 a year earlier.  Greg Barnes , a
Toronto-based analyst at TD Securities Inc., estimated $632.  Newmont fell 3.4 percent to $44.53 at the close in New
York.  The company, which has mines in the Americas, the Asia-
Pacific region and Africa, is developing a new mine in Ghana and
is expanding its Tanami operations in Australia. Newmont halted
construction of its $4.8 billion Minas Conga project in Peru in
November after clashes between police and opponents of the mine.
President  Ollanta Humala  authorized Newmont to resume work on
Conga on June 23 after a six-month deadlock.  Newmont’s second-quarter gold production was 1.18 million
ounces, compared with 1.22 million ounces a year earlier.  Anita Soni , an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in Toronto, estimated
1.27 million ounces.  The company narrowed its forecast for full-year production
to 5 million to 5.1 million ounces, from 5 million to 5.2
million.  Gold futures averaged $1,613 on the Comex in New York in
the quarter, 7 percent higher than a year earlier. Gold prices
have posted 11 consecutive annual gains.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , based in Toronto, is the largest gold
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
