YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s largest oil
company, said first-quarter net income dropped 19 percent as
costs increased.  Profit in the first three months of the year slid to 1.29
billion pesos ($284 million), or 3.29 pesos a share, from 1.6
billion pesos, or 4.06 pesos, a year ago, according to a
statement posted today on the securities regulator’s website.  Sales costs jumped 24 percent in the quarter amid higher
production costs while investments climbed 17 percent to 2.13
billion pesos, YPF said. The company was given more time to
report first-quarter results to form a new board following the
51 percent nationalization of the company in April.  No conference call is scheduled to discuss first-quarter
results. Second-quarter earnings may be released late August.  Argentina  seized 51 percent of YPF from  Spain ’s Repsol SA
as President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government seeks
to halt declining oil output and stem fuel imports that doubled
to $9.4 billion last year. YPF’s American depositary receipts
gained 0.2 percent to $12.31 at the close in  New York . The ADRs
have plunged 65 percent this year.  YPF will invest $7 billion in 2013 as it plans to double
exploration in five years and boost refining, Chief Executive
Officer Miguel Galuccio said June 6. The company targets
investments of $1.2 billion in shale oil next year, he said.  YPF appointed on June 4 a new 17-member board, in which
Repsol’s representative Luis Garcia del Rio is the sole minority
stakeholder member. Repsol, which holds a 12 percent stake in
YPF, said the nationalization was illegal and has filed a
lawsuit in New York.  Daniel Gonzalez was appointed chief financial officer, YPF
said in an separate statement today. Gonzalez, 42, headed Bank
of America Merrill Lynch’s Southern Cone operations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
