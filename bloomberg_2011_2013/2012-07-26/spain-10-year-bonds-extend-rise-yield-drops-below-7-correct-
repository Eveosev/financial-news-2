(Corrects second paragraph to say July 19.)  Spainâ€™s 10-year government bonds
extended their advance, pushing the yield below 7 percent, after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers
will do whatever is needed to preserve the euro.  Ten-year yields fell 38 basis points to 6.99 percent at
1:04 p.m. London time, falling below 7 percent for the first
time since July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
