Quest Water Global Inc. (QWTR) , whose
systems create water from humidity, is negotiating with the
 African Development Bank  for loans to build plants in  Angola ,
where half the population lacks clean drinking water.  The company received a letter of intent from the Tunisia-
based bank to finance plants that will cost $5.5 million to $6
million each, Quest Water said today in a statement. Water is
considered a “priority area of intervention” for the lender,
which will consider the funding after Angola submits a formal
request for support.  Quest Water’s AQUAtap plants can make as much as 20,000
liters (5,300 gallons) of water a day. The Vancouver-based
company has a facility in Bom Jesus, Angola, and is in talks
with the industry and the energy and water ministries to build
more, according to the statement.  Angola initiated its $650 million “ Water for All ” program
in 2007 to try to provide all of its rural population and 80
percent of city dwellers with clean water by 2020. Only 51
percent of Angolans have access to clean drinking water,
according to a United Nations  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
