Electricite de France SA started its
910-megawatt Blayais-3 nuclear power plant today after an
unplanned halt on July 23, according to the nation’s grid
operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  RTE removed the start date for EDF’s Penly-2 reactor, which
was scheduled to resume operations on July 31.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
41 reactors online, representing 70 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 atomic plants generate about
78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out
of service, their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
