Yields for spring wheat in  North
Dakota  and parts of  South Dakota  will top last year on early
planting and ample rainfall, according to results from the Wheat
Quality Council’s annual tour of the states.  Spring-wheat fields seen by analysts, farmers and brokers
will yield 44.9 bushels an acre, said Ben Handcock, the
executive vice president of the council. North Dakota growers
last year collected 40 bushels an acre, U.S. government data
show. Durum-wheat yields will total 42.4 bushels an acre, up
from 31 bushels last year, Handcock said.  “They got it in early, and that makes a big difference,”
Handcock said by telephone from near Fargo, North Dakota. “It
was a great spring. I knew it was going to look good, but I
didn’t know it was going to look that good.”  Spring-wheat futures for September delivery on the
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange  lost 2.1 percent to $9.6775 a bushel
today.  Spring wheat is a high-quality variety that’s used to make
bread and bagels. Durum is high in protein and used to make
pasta. The tour had about 71 participants, a record, Handcock
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
