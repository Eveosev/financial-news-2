New York  City Public Advocate Bill De Blasio sued Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  for information on fines,
saying complaints by small-business owners show the city is
seeking to boost revenue by increasing enforcement of
regulations.  De Blasio said in a petition filed in New York State
Supreme Court in  Manhattan  today that since he took office two
years ago small-business owners throughout the city have
complained of “overzealous enforcement of regulations and
imposition of fines and violations for low-risk, first-time
offenses.”  “These complaints reflect a pattern of increased
enforcement of regulations by the Bloomberg administration in an
attempt to boost City revenues during difficult economic times,
without regard for the impact this policy is having on the
city’s small-business owners,” De Blasio said.  The city has failed to provide information requested by the
public advocate on fines, which doubled to about $800 million in
2011 from about $400 million in 2002, De Blasio said in the
petition.  Marc LaVorgna , a spokesman for the mayor, said “restaurants
are cleaner, construction sites are safer, fires have come down,
and our streets are cleaner and safer than ever as a result of
enforcing the regulations we have put in place and the laws the
Council has passed.”  The mayor is the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg
LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News. The city has received
the petition and is reviewing it, Elizabeth Thomas, a
spokeswoman for the city’s Law Department, said.  The case is De Blasio v. Bloomberg, 103374/2012, New York
State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
