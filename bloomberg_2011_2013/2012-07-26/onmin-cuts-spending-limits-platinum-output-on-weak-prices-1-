Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the platinum producer
that lost half its value in the past year, cut its estimates of
production growth and  capital spending  after metal prices fell.  “The current lackluster demand for platinum group metals
and the weak pricing environment may persist for longer than we
had previously anticipated,” the London-based company said in a
statement today. Lonmin, the world’s third-largest platinum
producer, said it’s reviewing financing options.  Prices are down 22 percent in a year, while labor and power
costs in South Africa, owner of the most reserves, rose faster
than inflation.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the largest
producer, cut spending after posting a loss this week and idled
its Marikana mine, jointly owned with  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  In
addition, Aquarius suspended its Blue Ridge and Everest mines.  Lonmin will spend about $250 million in both the 2013 and
2014 financial years and cap 2013 sales at the current level of
750,000 ounces of platinum, it said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Farmer planned a year ago to spend an average $400 million a
year to boost annual output to 950,000 platinum ounces by 2015.  That target may be achieved two years later, BMO Capital
Markets analyst Edward Sterck said in a note today.  “The deferral in Lonmin’s ramp-up removes about 100,000 to
200,000 ounces per annum of platinum from the market over the
next three years,” SBG Securities Ltd. analysts Justin Froneman
and Michael Starke said. Lonmin and Aquarius’s cutbacks should
“ultimately support a higher platinum price,” they said.  Within Limits  While net debt is “well within” limits, Lonmin said it
may enter international markets. Lonmin replaced an $875 million
 facility  with $700 million of syndicated debt and three 660
million rand facilities a year ago to fund production growth.  The stock climbed 3.9 percent to 694 pence at the close in
 London . Sales for the nine months through June slid 2.1 percent
to 468,777 ounces, the company said in a statement today.  Lonmin produces all its metal in  South Africa , which holds
about 88 percent of known global platinum group metal reserves.  The company’s cost of producing an ounce of metal should
rise 8.5 percent this year from last year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
