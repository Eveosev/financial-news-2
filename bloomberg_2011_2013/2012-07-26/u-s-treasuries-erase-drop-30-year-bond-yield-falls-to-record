U.S Treasuries erased a decline,
with the yield on the 30-year bond falling less than one basis
point to 2.4433 percent as of 9:59 a.m. London time. That’s the
lowest since Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1977.  The rate on the nation’s 10-year note was little changed at
1.39 percent, after earlier rising as much as two basis points
to 1.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
