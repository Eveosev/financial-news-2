The  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  capped its biggest advance in almost a month after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to defend the euro.  3M Co. (V) , the maker of  Post-It Notes , and Visa Inc., the world’s largest payments network, rose at least 2 percent amid better-than-estimated earnings.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the nation’s largest homebuilder by revenue, surged 18 percent on a jump in orders.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  and MetroPCS Communications Inc. rallied more than 20 percent after their results.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  fell 9.8 percent at 5:23 p.m.  New York  time after posting a narrower profit margin as sales and marketing costs surged.  Seven stocks  rose  for every three falling on U.S. exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.7 percent to 1,360.02. It fell 2.8 percent over the previous four days. The Dow gained 211.88 points, or 1.7 percent, to 12,887.93. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 7.7 billion shares, or 15 percent above the three-month average.  “It is a big deal,” said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York- based chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp., which has $1.8 trillion in client assets. “The markets have been looking for a more definitive acknowledgement by key people like Draghi that they are willing to do what they need to do. We feel that if they want to save the euro, it would involve true QE,” she said, referring to bond buying to stimulate the economy.  Global stocks rallied and the euro rose by the most in almost a month against the dollar after Draghi suggested policy makers may intervene in bond markets as surging yields in Spain and Italy threaten the existence of the 17-nation currency bloc. The ECB mothballed its bond-buying program in March as it pushed governments to do more to control their deficits.  Earnings Season  All  10 industries  in the  S&P 500  gained today as earnings at about 72 percent of the 271 companies in the measure which have reported second-quarter  results  exceeded analysts’ projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  bull market  in American equities is intact and the S&P 500 will probably reach  1,380 (SPX)  within the next few months and rally from there, according to Laszlo Birinyi, president of research and money-management firm Birinyi Associates Inc. in Westport,  Connecticut . He said concern about  second-quarter earnings  are overblown and too many investors are worried about a “worst-case” outcome for stocks.  “It will be, as it has been, a case of three steps forward, two backward and trends lasting one day or five hours,” wrote Birinyi in a note to clients. The former Salomon Brothers Inc. equity trader, who described his forecast as “1,380 later this summer, and then higher,” said in the note: “Despite the frustrations of July with its volatility and curious price activity, we remain optimistic.”  July’s Loss  Today’s rally  trimmed  this month’s drop in the S&P 500 to 0.2 percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500, slumped 9.4 percent to 17.53. Earlier this week, the  VIX (VIX)  ended at the highest since June 15 amid concern about a global slowdown and  Europe ’s debt crisis.  3M (MMM)  rallied 2.1 percent to $90.59. Second-quarter profit beat estimates as gains in efficiency helped trump a drag from foreign-exchange rates. 3M had to overcome a stronger dollar that eroded the value of local-currency sales outside the U.S.  Visa rose 3.7 percent to $126.77. It has benefited from a consumer shift from cash to electronic payments that shows no signs of abating, while parrying threats to its business model.  A measure of  homebuilders  in S&P indexes climbed 6.4 percent. PulteGroup soared 18 percent, the most since 2008, to $11.86 after the company reported profit that beat analysts’ projections amid a 32 percent jump in orders.

Sprint Nextel rallied 20 percent, the most since 2009, to $4.05. Sales at the wireless carrier were bolstered by customers spending more on data plans.

(NYT)  gained 11 percent to $7.80. The newspaper publishing company reported a narrower  loss  in the second quarter amid a gain in digital subscriptions.  CBS Corp. (CBS)  jumped 4.9 percent to $32.63. The owner of the most-watched U.S. television network will raise its quarterly dividend 20 percent to 12 cents and expand a stock buyback program to as much as $4.7 billion.  Economic Data  Stocks rose even as data showed that a slump in June orders for equipment signals business investment may cool in the second half of the year. Jobless claims fell more than forecast last week, which may have resulted from difficulty adjusting data for seasonal shutdowns of auto factories.  Facebook fell 8.5 percent today ahead of its results as  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  missed analysts’ second-quarter revenue and profit estimates. The biggest developer of games played on Facebook’s social network plunged 37 percent to $3.18 today.  After the close of regular trading, Facebook slumped 9.8 percent to $24.22. Marketing and sales expenses jumped more than fourfold. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg  is spending more to increase the user base, which swelled to 955 million last quarter, and seeks to attract advertisers.  “Ultimately, Facebook is just an advertising platform, and so advertisers go where people’s eyeballs are,” said  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. Based on the number of users Facebook has amassed, “they’ve built the third- largest country; it just happens to live on the Internet.”  Starbucks’ Results  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s largest coffee-shop chain, also reported results after the market closed. Third-quarter profit rose less than analysts estimated amid weak demand in Europe.

(CSH)  dropped 19 percent, the most since 2005, to $36.69. The world’s largest pawn shop operator posted  results  that missed estimates and said third- quarter earnings will be lower than last year.  Anyone buying  Apple (AAPL)  Inc.’s stock after last quarter’s sales shortfall at the iPhone maker has history on their side, according to  Gene Munster , a Piper Jaffray Cos. analyst.  Disappointing Revenue  A study shows how Apple performed after four earlier cases of disappointing quarterly revenue, as tracked by Munster. They occurred in fiscal 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2011, with iPhone sales trailing estimates in the latter case. Six months later, the shares were 23 percent higher on average.  “It’s going to be an in-vogue stock again shortly,” Munster said yesterday in a Bloomberg Radio interview. He cited the pending introduction of the next iPhone model, known as the iPhone 5, which he expects in October. “We’re going to see a significant rebound in the December quarter, and that’s probably an understatement,” he said.
