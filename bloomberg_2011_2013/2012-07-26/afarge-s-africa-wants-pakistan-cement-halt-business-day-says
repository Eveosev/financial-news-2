Lafarge SA (LG) ’s South African unit may
ask country’s the International Trade Administration Commission
to block imports of the building material from  Pakistan ,
Business Day reported, citing Lafarge  South Africa  Chief
Executive Officer Thierry Legrand.  The unit of Lafarge, the world’s largest cement maker, is
concerned that the cement, which it says is of low-quality is
being used for building projects in South Africa, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said.  Some importers are labeling cement as flour to avoid
quality tests, Business Day said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
