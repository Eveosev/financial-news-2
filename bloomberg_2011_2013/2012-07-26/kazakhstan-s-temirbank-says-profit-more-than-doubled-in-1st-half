AO Temirbank (TEBN) , the lender controlled
by Kazakhstan’s Samruk-Kazyna  wealth fund , more than doubled
profit in the first half from a year earlier.  Net income increased to 1.25 billion tenge ($8.3 million)
in the six months through June from 493 million tenge in the
same period a year earlier, the Almaty-based lender said in an
e-mailed statement today, citing calculations based on unaudited
results under international financial reporting standards.  Temirbank said its capital grew by 2.2 percent to 58.3
billion tenge in the first half compared with the beginning of
the year. Loan holdings advanced 7.6 percent in the year through
June 30 to 190.3 billion tenge, the bank said.  Temirbank  said  yesterday that it’s seeking to sell 7.78
billion tenge of bad unsecured loans and is accepting bids until
Aug. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
