The Portuguese  economy  will contract
for a third year in 2013 as domestic demand drops, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 3.2 percent this year
and 0.9 percent in 2013, the Paris-based OECD forecast in an
economic survey released today. The government estimates GDP
will grow 0.2 percent in 2013 after contracting 3 percent this
year.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is facing a recession
and rising unemployment as he cuts spending and raises taxes to
meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($95 billion) aid plan from
the European Union and the  International Monetary Fund . As the
country’s borrowing costs surged, Portugal last year followed
Greece and Ireland in seeking a bailout and now aims to return
to bond markets in 2013.  “The size of the consolidation in 2012 is very large and
the risk that fiscal targets are not met because growth
undershoots expectations in a credit constrained and weak
international environment is significant,” the OECD said.
“Therefore, the government faces additional challenges to
regain full  market access  within the program period.”  Portugal  targets a budget deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in
2012 and 3 percent in 2013. Portuguese economic growth has
averaged less than 1 percent a year for the past decade, placing
it among Europe’s weakest performers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
