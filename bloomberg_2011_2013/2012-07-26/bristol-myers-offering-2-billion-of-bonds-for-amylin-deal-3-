Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  obtained
record low coupons in its $2 billion debt sale, for five- and
30-year dollar-denominated corporate debt.  The biopharmaceutical producer sold its five-year notes
with a 0.875 percent coupon and its 30-year securities at 3.25
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from
the company’s first debt sale in more than four years will help
fund its $5.3 billion purchase of  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc (AMLN) ,
said a person familiar with the transaction.  The maker of the blood thinner Plavix sold $750 million of
five-year debentures at an issue price of 99.091 cents on the
dollar and a yield of 1.06 percent, Bloomberg data show. It also
issued $500 million of 30-year bonds at 96.335 cents on the
dollar and a 3.45 percent yield.  The coupons beat the previous five-year record of 1 percent
on 3M Co.’s June 2017 notes and the 30-year low of 3.375 percent
on Temasek Holdings Pte’s July 2042 bonds, the data show.  Bristol-Myers’s sale also included $750 million of 2
percent, 10-year debentures that sold at an issue price of
98.514 cents on the dollar and a yield of 2.17 percent, the data
show.  The company last offered debt in April 2008, selling $600
million of 5.45 percent, 10-year securities and $1 billion of
6.125 percent, 30-year debentures, both at a yield of 165 basis
points more than benchmarks, the data show.  The new bonds are rated A2, the sixth-highest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the data show.
The bonds can be redeemed at 101 cents on the dollar if the
acquisition isn’t completed by Dec. 31, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the terms are private.  Managers on the deal included Citigroup Inc., Bank of
America Corp., Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo & Co.
and JPMorgan Chase & Co., the data show.  Bristol-Myers announced its purchase of Amylin, a maker of
diabetes therapies, in June as it seeks to replace revenue from
its top-selling blood thinner that’s facing generic competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
