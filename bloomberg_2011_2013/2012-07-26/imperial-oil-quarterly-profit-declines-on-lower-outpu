Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO) , the Canadian
company that’s planning to more than double its output this
decade, said second-quarter profit declined 13 percent as crude
prices and production dropped.  Net income fell to C$635 million ($630 million), or 75
cents a share, from C$726 million, or 85 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. Sales
decreased 3.3 percent to C$7.52 billion.  Imperial, which is  70 percent owned  by  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
said production fell because of maintenance work at its Cold
Lake oil-sands project and at Syncrude Canada Ltd. Gross oil
output decreased 4.9 percent to 232,000 barrels a day from
244,000 a year earlier.  Prices for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark for
crude, averaged $93.35 a barrel in the second quarter, down 8.8
percent from $102.34 a year earlier. Western Canada Select, a
Canadian blend used to price crude from  oil sands , fell 13
percent to $73.53 a barrel from $84.72 in the same period a year
earlier.  Imperial expects its Kearl oil-sands project to begin
operating later this year, it said. The project will have
initial capacity to produce 110,000 barrels a day, rising to
345,000 barrels by the end of this decade, according to the
 company’s website .  Oil producers gained today after the fuel rose for a third
day in  New York . U.S. reports on durable goods and jobless
claims reduced concern that economic growth is slowing and the
head of the  European Central Bank  pledged that the euro will
survive.  Imperial climbed 0.9 percent to C$42.77 at the close in
Toronto. The stock, which has declined 5.8 percent this year,
has four buy, 10 hold and two sell  ratings  from analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
