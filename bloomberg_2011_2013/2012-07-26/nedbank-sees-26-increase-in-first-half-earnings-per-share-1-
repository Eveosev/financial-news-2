Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South
African bank controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said earnings per
share rose as much as 26 percent in the first half.  “The group continued to perform well in the second quarter
and has made good progress in delivering on its key strategic
focus areas,” the Johannesburg-based lender said in a statement
today. Nedbank had earnings a share of 5.98 rand in the year-
earlier period.  Absa Group Ltd., Nedbank’s competitor, will be the first of
South Africa’s four largest banks to report full results for the
period tomorrow. Absa said on June 26 earnings before one-time
items declined as much as 10 percent in the period on rising bad
loans. That prompted analysts including  David Shapiro , a
director at Johannesburg-based Sasfin Securities, to question
whether others will have to make similar provisions.  Nedbank pared its earlier losses and was up 1.2 percent at
179.78 rand as of 3:45 p.m. in Johannesburg trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
