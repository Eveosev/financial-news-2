GenOn Energy Inc. and  NRG Energy
Inc. (NRG) , the company acquiring it to create the largest U.S.
independent power producer, were sued by a shareholder claiming
the $1.7 billion all-stock deal undervalues the company.  Jared Fensin, a GenOn investor, sued the companies and
GenOn executives arguing that the proposed transaction
shortchanges shareholders and is structured in a way that
discourages other offers, according to a complaint filed today
in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. Fensin seeks to
represent all shareholders as a group.  Under the terms of the deal, GenOn shareholders will get
.1216 shares of Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG’s stock for each
of theirs, according to court filings. GenOn investors would get
about $2.19 based on NRG’s closing share price of $18.05 on July
20, the last trading day before the deal was announced.  The takeover is “unfair and grossly inadequate” because
“the intrinsic value of GenOn’s common stock is materially in
excess of the amount offered,” Fensin’s lawyers said in court
papers.  NRG stockholders would own about 71 percent of the combined
company and GenOn shareholders would own the remaining 29
percent, according to court documents.  Lori Neuman, a spokeswoman for NRG, didn’t immediately
return a call after regular business hours seeking comment on
the lawsuit. Laurie Fickman, a spokeswoman for GenOn, declined
to comment on it.  Competing Offers  The deal should also be blocked because it contains
provisions that “all but ensure the proposed transaction is
successful and no competing offers will emerge,” lawyers for
Fensin said in court filings.  GenOn, based in Houston, is barred from soliciting any
competing offers because of a so-called “no-shop” provision,
according to court documents. If an offer surfaces, NRG must be
notified within a day and then has 4 days to negotiate and
modify its offer.  NRG would get a $60 million fee, about 3.5 percent of the
deal value, if GenOn accepts another bid, according to court
filings.  The case is Fensin v.  GenOn Energy Inc. (GEN) , CA7721, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
