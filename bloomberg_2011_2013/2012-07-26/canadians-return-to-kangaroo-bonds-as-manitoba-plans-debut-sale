Province of Manitoba sold A$200
million ($207 million) of Kangaroo bonds, the first offering in
 Australia  from a Canadian borrower in a year.  The 4.25 percent 10-year notes were priced to yield 160.5
basis points more than similar-maturity government debt,
according to an e-mailed statement from TD Securities Inc.,
which managed the province’s debut Kangaroo sale with  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  Export Development Canada, the nation’s
export financing agency, is also planning to sell at least A$300
million of five-year debt, according to a statement from
Citigroup Inc., one of the banks helping to manage the offering.  Sales of Kangaroo bonds, or Australian dollar-denominated
notes sold by foreign issuers in the South Pacific nation,
almost doubled from June to a four-month high of A$3.35 billion
this month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on
bonds issued by government-backed borrowers in the Australian
currency fell to a record-low 3.49 percent on July 23, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data that goes back to
1999.  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce sold A$600 million of
5.25 percent January 2015 securities in July 2011, the last
Kangaroo bond sale by a borrower from the nation before
Manitoba’s offering, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Other Canadian provinces that have issued Kangaroo bonds
include Manitoba’s eastern neighbors Ontario and  Quebec , the
data show. The Province of Quebec sold a A$225 million 10-year
bond last year that is trading at 192 basis points over similar
maturity government notes, Bloomberg prices show.  Manitoba, whose economy consists primarily of
manufacturing, mining, agriculture, and forestry, is rated AA by
Standard & Poor’s and Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Quebec is ranked one
level lower by Moody’s, and two by S&P.  To contact the reporter on this story:
