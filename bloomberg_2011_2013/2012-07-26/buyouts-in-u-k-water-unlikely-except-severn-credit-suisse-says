Buyouts in Britain’s water sector
are unlikely though Severn Trent Plc, one of the U.K.’s three
publicly traded water companies, is considered the “most likely
candidate,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts said.  “Capital-rich sovereign wealth funds are likely to pursue
further acquisitions in the unlisted space, in our view, but we
do not expect appetite for large-scale hostile buyouts,” Credit
Suisse analysts including Guy MacKenzie said in a report today.  “If a buyout were to take place, we would view Severn
Trent as the most likely candidate owing to its small size
compared with” Warrington-based United Utilities Plc and low
downside risk from price control reviews being proposed for
2014, the report said. United Utilities “would be the least
likely candidate in our view.”  Recent U.K. water sector transactions have been relatively
small-scale and privately negotiated. “We do not view these as
precursors to large-scale takeovers,” the note said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
