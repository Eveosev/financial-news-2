Tunisia  plans to sell 25 percent of
Tunisiana, the country’s second-largest mobile-phone network
operator, in an auction, the government said today.  “Financial companies and investment funds only are
concerned with the offer, which opens on 27 July with a November
2 deadline,” Slim Besbes, a finance ministry director, said at
a press conference.  Sakhr El Matri, son-in-law of Tunisia’s former president
Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, owned the stake prior to the 2011
revolt that toppled the regime. The government subsequently
acquired ownership.  The share sale aims at “maintaining the economic system
and preserving jobs in the confiscated company,” Besbes said.  Tunisiana is majority-owned by National Mobile
Telecommunications Co., the Kuwait-based unit of  Qatar Telecom
QSC. (QTEL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
