John Paulson , who is seeking to
reverse record declines in his $21 billion firm, may have lost
$48.9 million on his hedge funds’ stake in  NovaGold Resources
Inc. (NG)  as the stock slumped the most in more than three years.  NovaGold, which is 13 percent-owned by Paulson & Co., sank
25 percent today, the largest decline  since  December 2008, after
 Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s biggest producer of the metal,
said its Donlin Gold joint venture with NovaGold doesn’t meet
the company’s investment criteria. Greg Lang, NovaGold’s chief
executive officer, said in an interview today that he plans to
go ahead and develop Donlin, the company’s main project.  Paulson, who has been buying mining companies as part of a
bet on rising gold prices, has been bruised as the stocks
contributed to declines in some of his funds this year.
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , Paulson’s third-largest U.S. stock
holding as of March 31, has slumped 21 percent this year after a
14 percent loss in 2011. Paulson’s Advantage Plus fund fell 16
percent in the first half, while his Gold Fund declined 23
percent.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for New York-based hedge fund,
declined to comment.  Baupost Stake  Paulson & Co. held 36 million shares of Vancouver-based
NovaGold as of April 30, according to a May 10 filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, making it the company’s
second-largest shareholder. The stock fell $1.36 today,
translating into a $48.9 million paper loss for Paulson,
assuming the hedge fund didn’t reduce or increase its stake
since the last filing.  Other firms that may have been hurt by today’s decline
include Seth Klarman’s Baupost Group LLC, which held 10 million
shares at the end of March; Jamie Dinan’s York Capital
Management in  New York  that owns 5.4 million shares; and  Blue
Ridge  Capital LLC, John Griffin’s hedge fund, which had 3.6
million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Elaine Mann, a spokeswoman for Boston-based Baupost, Mary
Beth Grover, a spokeswoman for York, and Shawn Pattison, a
spokesman for Blue Ridge, declined to comment.  NovaGold closed at $4.02 in New York, bringing losses since
the end of April to 38 percent and valuing Paulson’s stake at
$144.6 million. The stake was worth $232.7 million as of April
30.  Paulson owned 915,000 shares of Barrick as of the end of
March, according to an  SEC filing . Barrick fell 3.2 percent
today for a paper loss of $979,050 if the size of the stake
hasn’t changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
