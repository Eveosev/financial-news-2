Grain output in  Poland , the European
Union’s third-largest producer behind France and  Germany , may be
3 percent to 6 percent lower this year at 22.8 million metric
tons to 23.5 million tons on frost damage to higher-yielding
winter crops, the Warsaw-based  Central Statistical Office  said
today in an e-mailed statement.  In its first crop production estimate for this year, the
statistical office estimated rapeseed output at 1.56 million
tons to 1.64 million tons, 12 percent to 16 percent below 2011.  Winter wheat output may be 33 percent lower than last
year’s at about 5.55 million tons, the office said. Spring wheat
production is seen at 2.42 million tons to 2.62 million tons,
more than double the 2011 level, as producers replaced winter
losses with lower-yielding spring plantings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
