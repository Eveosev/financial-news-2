Spanish and Italian bonds rose for a
second day as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
officials will do whatever it takes to preserve the euro,
suggesting policy makers may step in to cap surging debt yields.  Spain’s  two-year yield  fell the most this month and 10-year
rates dropped below 7 percent after Draghi said addressing
rising borrowing costs was within the central bank’s mandate.
German bunds declined as his comments damped demand for the
region’s safest assets. Irish notes advanced, with  two-year
yields  falling below 4 percent, after the government said it
would sell new bonds for the first time in almost two years.  “Draghi’s comments are important, especially the phrases
that suggest the ECB is contemplating doing something actively
to bring down yields for  Spain  and Italy,” said Piet Lammens,
head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “It takes some of
the very sharp pressure off Spanish and Italian yields. Draghi
is clearly opening the door to doing something.”  Spain’s  two-year note yield  fell 76 basis points, or 0.76
percentage point, to 5.66 percent at 4:36 p.m. London time after
sliding as much as 79 basis points, the most since June 29. The
4.75 percent note due in July 2014 rose 1.375, or 13.75 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,229) face amount, to 98.33.  Italy’s  two-year yield  declined 88 basis points to 4.06
percent. It fell to 4.07 percent, the lowest since July 20.  Draghi Comments  Draghi’s comments came amid pressure from Spanish policy
makers after the nation’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields
all surged above 7 percent yesterday, the level that spurred
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts.  “To the extent that the size of these sovereign premia
hamper the functioning of the monetary policy transmission
channel, they come within our mandate,” Draghi said in a speech
today in London. “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do
whatever it takes to preserve the euro.”  The bonds of so-called peripheral nations rallied yesterday
after ECB council member Ewald Nowotny said there were arguments
in favor of giving the region’s bailout fund a banking license,
increasing its firepower.  Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said
today giving the license to the European Stability Mechanism
would stop speculation in debt markets, Efe newswire reported.
That would give the ESM resources to “extinguish the public
debt fire,” the newswire cited him as saying.  Spain’s  10-year yield  fell 44 basis points to 6.93 percent
after rising to 7.75 percent yesterday, the highest since
November 1996.  Italy ’s 10-year rate declined 39 basis points to
6.06 percent.  ‘Very Wary’  “The possibility that a central-bank funded government
bond-buying program could at least get discussed will make
anyone who’s short peripheral markets very, very wary,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. A short position is a bet
an asset will decline.  Ireland’s bonds advanced after the National Treasury
Management Agency offered to sell October 2017 notes at a yield
of 5.9 percent and October 2020 securities at a yield of 6.1
percent. It also plans to switch bonds due in 2013 and 2014 for
those maturing in 2017 and 2020, offering higher yields to
investors in return.  “This is good news and clearly illustrates that Ireland’s
recovery is on track,”  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske
Bank A/S in Copenhagen, wrote in an e-mailed note. “We
recommend our clients to participate in the operations by the
NTMA. Terms and conditions are in our view very favorable.”  Ireland’s  two-year note  yield dropped 20 basis points to
3.92 percent after falling to 3.79 percent, the lowest level
since October 2010.  Italy Auction  Italy sold its maximum target of 2.5 billion euros at an
auction of zero-coupon debt due in 2014 today. The sale
attracted an a yield of 4.86 percent, the highest since November
and investors bid for 1.78 times the amount allotted, versus
1.65 times last month.  Germany ’s  10-year bund yield  climbed seven basis points to
1.33 percent. It declined to an all-time low of 1.127 percent on
June 1 and July 23. The two-year yield rose one basis point to
minus 0.051 percent.  A German consumer-sentiment index will increase for a
second month to 5.9 in August, from 5.8 in July, GfK SE said in
a report today. Economists predicted an unchanged reading,
according to a Bloomberg News survey.  German debt returned 4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
lost 8.3 percent, while Italy’s bonds earned 4.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
