Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) ,  Asia ’s
second-largest carrier by market value, rose the most in eight
months on the city-state’s exchange after beating analysts’
estimates with its first profit increase in seven quarters.  The  stock  climbed as much as 2.7 percent in Singapore
trading, the biggest gain on intraday basis since November 28.
Singapore Air was up 2.3 percent at S$10.94 as of 10:49 a.m,
while the benchmark Straits Times Index gained 0.5 percent.  Net income  jumped 73 percent to S$78 million ($62 million)
in the three months ended June as lower jet fuel prices and
cheaper tickets boosted passenger numbers and limited the impact
of declining yields, a measure of average fares. The profit beat
the S$69 million average of four analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News.  “The result was significantly better than our expectation
for a marginal profit,”  Jim Wong  and Shirley Lam, analysts at
Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note to clients yesterday.
“Deterioration in passenger yields has at least been partially
offset by the more significant decline in jet fuel prices.”  The results should provide “positive read across” to
profit reports of other airlines, such as  Cathay Pacific Airways
Ltd (293) , they said.  Yields at Singapore Air’s main unit dropped 3.4 percent
from a year earlier, while fuel prices fell 6.7 percent. Jet
kerosene prices averaged $122.2 a barrel in Singapore trading in
the period, compared with $131 a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cathay Pacific gained 0.5 percent to HK$12.64 in Hong Kong
trading. It is due to report first half results on Aug. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
