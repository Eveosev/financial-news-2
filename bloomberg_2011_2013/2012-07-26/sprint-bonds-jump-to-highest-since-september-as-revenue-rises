Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  bonds jumped to
the highest price in 10 months after the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier posted higher second-quarter revenue than
analysts had predicted, bolstered by customers spending more on
data plans.  Sprintâ€™s $2.48 billion of 6.875 percent notes due November
2028 climbed 3.8 cents to 86.8 cents on the dollar as of 10:18
a.m. in New York, the highest price since Sept. 15, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The bonds have traded as low as 72.8 cents
on June 4.  Sales rose 6.4 percent to $8.84 billion,  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Sprint said today in a statement. Analysts had
estimated $8.73 billion on average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
