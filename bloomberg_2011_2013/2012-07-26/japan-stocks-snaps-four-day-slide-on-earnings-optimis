Japanese  stocks  rose for the first
time in five days, with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gaining the
most in a month, on earnings optimism as  Fanuc (6954)  Corp. reported
higher profit and as JFE Holdings Inc.’s forecast for net income
topped estimates.  Fanuc, the world’s largest maker of factory robotics,
advanced 5.3 percent after reporting an increase in first-
quarter net profit. JFE Holdings Inc. climbed 2.3 percent after
the steelmaker forecast net income of 80 billion yen.  Olympus
Corp. (7733)  led gains on the Nikkei 225 as Terumo Corp. moved to merge
with the optics maker.  The Nikkei 225 advanced 0.9 percent to 8,443.10, its
biggest gain since June 29, at the 3 p.m. close of trading in
Tokyo. The broader  Topix Index (TPX)  rose 1.2 percent to 714.91, with
more than five shares rising for each that declined.  “We’re probably going to see this first quarter for fiscal
2012 posting the first positive sequential rise in profitability
for corporate Japan,” Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  Tokyo , said in a Bloomberg TV
interview. “On the one hand you’re going to see a lot of
weakness from global cyclical export companies. On the other
hand you’re going to see surprisingly resilient results coming
from domestic demand-oriented companies.”  The Topix fell 18 percent from this year’s high on March 27
amid concern the U.S. and Chinese economies are slowing and that
 Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen. The decline has left shares on
the Topix valued at 0.8 times book value, compared with 2.1 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. A number below one means investors can buy companies for
less than the value of their assets.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The gauge
lost less than 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday, erasing gains
in the final hour of trading, after a report showed demand for
new U.S. homes unexpectedly dropped in June from a two-year high.  Fanuc Rises  Fanuc advanced 5.3 percent to 12,680 yen. Net income rose
1.5 percent to 35.2 billion yen ($450 million) in the three
months ended June 30 while sales rose 4.9 percent to 137.8
billion yen, the company reported yesterday.  Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. (6305)  climbed 6.2 percent to
1,341 yen as operating profit in the first quarter beat analyst
estimates. Machinery stocks also rose after U.S. bellwether
Caterpillar Inc. raised its earnings outlook.  JFE rose 2.3 percent to 991 yen as  Japan ’s second-largest
steelmaker forecast full-year net income of 80 billion yen,
beating the 69.5 billion yen forecast by 16 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Gains were limited after Il Houng Lee, the International
Monetary Fund’s senior representative in  China , yesterday said
the Chinese government will probably maintain the “status quo”
after already shifting monetary stance to a “more neutral or
accommodating one” and may forgo expanding this year’s budget.  Olympus Merger  Olympus soared 9.6 percent to 1,400 yen. Terumo,  Asia ’s
biggest maker of medical devices, said it proposed investing 50
billion yen in the endoscope manufacturer. Olympus is also in
discussions with Sony and Fujifilm Holdings Corp. about possible
tie-ups, Olympus Chairman Yasuyuki Kimoto said in a July 23
interview.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  advanced 5.7 percent to 259 yen. Koji
Nagai, president of the domestic brokerage unit, will be
promoted to chief executive officer to replace Kenichi Watanabe,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Watanabe and Chief Operating Officer Takumi Shibata will
step down to take responsibility for incidents in which
employees leaked information about clients’ share sales to
traders, two people said earlier today, asking to remain
anonymous before an announcement.  Nomura, Japan’s largest brokerage, today reported first-
quarter profit fell 89 percent to 1.9 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
