Estonia’s parliament may hold two
final readings on Aug. 30 to ratify the European Stability
Mechanism, the euro-region’s permanent rescue fund, the
government said.  The Cabinet sent the bill today to the parliament, based in
the capital, Tallinn, after the  Supreme Court  ruled last month
that the ESM’s founding treaty complies with the Baltic nation’s
constitution, according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
