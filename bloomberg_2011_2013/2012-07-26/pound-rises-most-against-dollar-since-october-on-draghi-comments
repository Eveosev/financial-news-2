The pound rose the most against the
dollar since December 2010 on optimism European policy makers
will step up efforts to contain the debt crisis, improving the
outlook for the U.K. economy.  Sterling advanced against all except three of its 16 major
counterparts after European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi 
said officials will do whatever is needed to preserve the single
currency, suggesting officials may intervene in bond markets to
contain rising borrowing costs. U.K. gilts dropped for the first
time in five days as demand for safer assets waned.  “Draghi’s comments have given a lift to risk in general
and so the pound has rallied significantly against the dollar,”
said Peter Kinsella, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London .  The pound rose 1.2 percent to $1.5690 at 4:21 p.m. London
time after climbing as much as 1.5 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since Dec. 31, 2010. The U.K. currency appreciated 0.1
percent to 78.38 per euro. It advanced to 77.55 pence on July
23, the strongest level since October 2008.  Draghi’s comments came amid pressure from Spanish policy
makers after the nation’s two-, five-, 10- and 30-year yields
all surged above 7 percent yesterday, the level that spurred
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts.  “Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it
takes to preserve the euro,” Draghi said in a speech at the
Global Investment Conference today in London. “Believe me, it
will be enough.”  Third Best  The pound has appreciated 4.6 percent in the past year, the
third best performer behind the yen and the dollar of the 10
developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The euro has fallen 7.7 percent.  The 10-year gilt yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.49 percent. The 4 percent bond maturing
in March 2022 fell 0.285, or 2.85 pounds per 1,000 pound face
amount, to 122.435.  Two-year yield dropped to a record before Draghi’s comments
as concern the regional debt crisis will worsen underpinned
demand for the safest securities.  The two-year yield fell to an all-time low of 0.046 percent
before rising three basis points 0.092 percent.  Bank of England  policy makers meet next week after boosting
asset purchases, or so-called quantitative easing, by 50 billion
pounds this month.  The U.K. economy shrank the most since 2009 in the second
quarter, a government report showed yesterday. Gross domestic
product contracted 0.7 percent from the first quarter, when it
dropped 0.3 percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said.  “From a quantitative-easing perspective, the bullish
scenario for gilts is still very much intact,” said  Sam Hill , a
gilt strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in London.  Hill said Royal Bank of Canada is predicting the central
bank will increase asset purchases by another 50 billion pounds
when it meets in November.  U.K. government bonds have returned 17 percent in the past
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Bunds
gained 12 percent, and Treasuries rose 9.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
