Galenica AG (GALN) , the world’s biggest
maker of iron replacement drugs, fell the most in almost a year
after the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  withheld approval of
its Injectafer treatment.  Galenica dropped as much as 6.7 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Aug. 9, and was down 6.3 percent at 539.5
Swiss francs as of 9:21 a.m., cutting the company’s market value
to 3.51 billion francs ($3.54 billion).  The regulator’s decision was related to a factory in
Shirley,  New York , owned by Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, where
Injectafer would be made for the U.S. market, Bern, Switzerland-
based Galenica said in a  statement  today. The FDA didn’t ask for
any additional information on the drug itself.  “During a recent inspection, deficiencies in the
manufacturing facility were noted by the FDA inspectors,”
Galenica said. “The FDA requires satisfactory resolution of
these deficiencies before the application for Injectafer can be
approved. Luitpold Pharmaceuticals is working closely with the
FDA to resolve these deficiencies.”  Luitpold, a unit of Tokyo-based Daiichi Sankyo Co., holds
U.S. marketing rights for Injectafer. The drug is sold outside
the U.S. as Ferinject.  To contact the reporter on this story:
