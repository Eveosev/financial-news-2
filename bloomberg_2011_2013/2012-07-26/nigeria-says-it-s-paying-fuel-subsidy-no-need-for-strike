Nigeria ’s government said it is
paying a subsidy on gasoline after verifying claims, and that
there is no justification for  strike action  by fuel retailers on
the grounds they are not receiving the payments.  “Payments based on verified claims resumed after the June
meeting of the Federation Accounts Allocations Committee,” when
payments of 17 billion naira ($106 million) were made, the
Abuja-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  The Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association
suspended fuel distribution in  Africa ’s top crude oil producer
from July 25 because members haven’t received outstanding
payments since the beginning of the year, said Dapo Abiodun,
chairman of the association.  The government is verifying claims to “prevent
overpayments,” the ministry said today. Some oil importers also
owe the government “significant sums of money and the
government expects that these will be paid,” it said, citing a
report by a Presidential committee.  Fuel importers including the state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. received 1.1 trillion naira in fraudulent
subsidies from the government between 2009 and 2011, according
to a parliamentary committee that reported on the issue in April.  President  Goodluck Jonathan  partially reinstated the
subsidy after unions staged a weeklong strike in January against
his attempt to scrap it. Nigeria imports most of its gasoline
needs because it lacks the refining capacity to meet domestic
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
