Home sales in the Hamptons, the Long
Island beach retreat for summering Manhattanites, jumped to a
five-year high as both the priciest mansions and entry-level
properties attracted buyers.  There were 539 transactions in the second quarter, up 9.6
percent from a year earlier and the most since the first three
months of 2007, when home values in the area were climbing
toward their peak, according to a report today by appraiser
 Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real
Estate . Purchases of properties priced at more than $5 million
totaled 38, matching the level at the end of 2010. That was the
highest since the firms began tracking the data five years ago.  “In the high end, there’s this sort of herd mentality of
one sale leads to another,”  Jonathan Miller , president of New
York-based Miller Samuel, said in an interview. “You see some
high-end sales and it gives people the impetus to list.”  Luxury properties are luring buyers as the New York City
job market improves and wealthy overseas investors seek havens
for cash, according to Miller. The city added 80,000 private-
sector  jobs  in the 12 months through June, the state Department
of Labor said last week. About 4,400 of those jobs were at
financial companies, whose employees are among the top buyers of
Hamptons homes.  Mortgage rates  at  record lows  drove deals for
the least expensive homes, Miller said.  Purchases of properties costing less than $1 million
accounted for 64 percent of all sales in the quarter, dropping
the median price 9.3 percent from a year earlier to $850,000,
according to  Miller Samuel  and Prudential.  Priciest Deal  The median for luxury properties in the Hamptons and North
Fork, defined as the top 10 percent of all sales by price,
jumped 16 percent to $5.13 million.  The quarter’s most expensive transaction was the purchase
of  43 Surfside Drive  in Bridgehampton for $27.3 million, Miller
said. The 7,142-square-foot (664-square-meter), nine-bedroom
home sits on almost 2 acres (0.8 hectares), according to a
listing on real estate website Zillow.com.  The inventory of homes available  to purchase  in the
Hamptons climbed 11 percent from a year earlier to 1,798,
according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. The absorption rate,
or the length of time it would take to sell those homes at the
current pace of transactions, is 10 months. The five-year
average is 14.4 months.  Active Market  In the luxury market, inventory swelled 55 percent to 321
properties.  “The demand is clearly there and the supply is there,”
said Gregory Heym, chief economist for brokerage  Brown Harris
Stevens , which also released a report on the Hamptons today.
“The fact that the market is very active is appealing to
people.”  For Charles Ruoff, the brisk pace of deals allowed him to
sell one house in  East Hampton  and buy another one in
Bridgehampton in less than six months.  In early 2012, Ruoff sold the two-bedroom home on Three
Mile Harbor Road for $850,000, 9.6 percent more than what he
paid for it in 2007. Then in May, he purchased a two-family
fixer-upper on  Halsey Lane  in Bridgehampton for $775,000 --18
percent less than what its sellers initially sought.  He financed the deal with a  30-year fixed  mortgage at about
4.5 percent, and is planning to invest about $150,000 more to
install central air conditioning and remodel three bathrooms and
two kitchens.  ‘Upward Appreciation’  “I saw a lot more upward appreciation and value, long-
term,” said Ruoff, 50, who works in  Brooklyn  as a real estate
 broker  with Brown Harris Stevens. “I’m hoping to hold onto this
for a long time.”  Sales increased in all six towns surveyed for the Brown
Harris report. In Bridgehampton, there were 50 deals in the
second quarter, compared with 36 a year earlier. The median
price climbed 34 percent to $2.74 million, the brokerage said.  Transactions in East Hampton jumped 39 percent, with 97
properties changing hands. The median price declined 17 percent
to $808,750, according to Brown Harris.  Montauk sales climbed 11 percent, according to a report
this month by brokerage  Town & Country Real Estate . The combined
dollar value of the 20 homes that sold during the quarter
increased 46 percent from a year earlier to $27.5 million, while
the median price was little changed at $840,000.  In Sag Harbor Village, purchases jumped 17 percent to 14
deals, and the median price fell 49 percent from a year earlier
to $710,000, Town & Country said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
