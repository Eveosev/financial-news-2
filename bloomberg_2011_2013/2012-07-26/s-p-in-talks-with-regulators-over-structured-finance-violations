Standard & Poor’s , the world’s
largest credit-rating company, said it’s in discussions with
U.S. regulators over potential violations related to structured-
finance ratings.  The  Department of Justice  and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission are investigating possible civil violations
related to S&P’s ratings of structured products, Harold “Terry” McGraw III, the chief executive officer of  New York- 
based McGraw-Hill Cos., S&P’s owner, said today on a conference
call to discuss earnings.  “Of course we have been in discussions with
representatives of both the DOJ and the SEC, and presenting our
position on those issues,” McGraw said.  S&P and other credit-rating companies were blamed for
helping inflate the housing bubble by both the Financial Crisis
Inquiry Commission and a Senate report last year. Investors lost
billions on top-rated bonds after the companies lowered their
standards in an effort to win more business from Wall Street
banks, according to the panels.  S&P received a so-called Wells notice last year from the
SEC indicating it could face claims over the top grade it gave
in 2007 to a $1.6 billion collateralized debt obligation called
Delphinus CDO 2007-1 that was downgraded six months later.
 Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  last week agreed to pay $128 million
to settle U.S. regulatory claims that it used “dummy assets”
to inflate the credit ratings of the Delphinus CDO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
