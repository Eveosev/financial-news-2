The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 3 basis points to 172 basis points
as of 8:24 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge is headed for its lowest close since July
20, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 1 basis point to
184 as of 10:03 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The benchmark is poised to close lower after rising
for four straight business days since July 19, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 187
basis points as of 9:27 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. Itâ€™s traded between 168.5 basis points and 188.75 basis
points this month, CMA prices show.  The indexes are benchmarks for insuring bonds against
default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A
drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an
increase suggests the opposite.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
