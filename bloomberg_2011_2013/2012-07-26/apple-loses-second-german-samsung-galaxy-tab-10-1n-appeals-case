Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost its second German
appeals court bid this week to ban sales of  Samsung Electronics (005930) 
Co.’s Galaxy 10.1N tablet computer.  The Munich Higher Regional Court rejected Apple’s appeal of
a February lower court ruling that rejected a request based on
patents to block sales of the tablet as well as the Galaxy Nexus
mobile phone. A Dusseldorf appeals panel on July 24 rejected a
similar motion relying on European design rights.  Apple has been fighting tablet competitors in courts across
the globe for about a year. The iPad maker scored a victory in
January when a sales ban on the older Galaxy 10.1 model was
upheld by Dusseldorf appeals judges.  A U.K. judge earlier this month ruled that the 10.1 tablet
didn’t infringe Apple’s design rights, while U.S. District Judge
Lucy Koh in June issued an order blocking U.S. sales of the
device.  Samsung said in an e-mailed statement that Apple was
“trying to limit consumer choice and discourage innovation
through their excessive and flawed legal arguments.”  Apple’s German press office declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
