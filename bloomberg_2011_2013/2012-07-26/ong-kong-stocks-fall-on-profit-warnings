 Hong Kong  stocks  swung between
gains and losses as companies warned of lower profit and the
International Monetary Fund’s China representative said the
country may have already done enough to put a recovery in place.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled mainland
developer, rose 2 percent after Daiwa Capital Markets H.K. Ltd.
said it doesn’t foresee any further curbs on the  property
market .  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the Asian unit of  Sheldon Adelson ’s
Las Vegas company, lost 6.3 percent after saying its second-
quarter net income fell 40 percent from last year. Xingye Copper
International Group, a Chinese producer of copper products, fell
3.7 percent after saying it expected a “significant” decline
in first half profit.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed 18,882.19 as of
11:24 a.m. Hong Kong time, with the measure swinging between a
gain of 0.3 percent and a loss of 0.5 percent. About eight
companies climbed for every seven that fell on the 49-member
gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies was little changed at 9,212.  “Investors generally want to be optimistic,” said Marco Li, Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset
Management, which oversees $208 billion globally. “The major
focus is earnings, if you can get some large weights saying the
outlook is improving, that will turn the market higher.”  The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 13 percent from this
year’s high in February through yesterday on signs Europe’s debt
crisis is worsening while growth slows in China and the U.S. The
drop cut the  value  of shares on the gauge to 9.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 10.6 for Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  were little changed at
18,857. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  lost 3 percent to 22.06,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.3 percent in the
benchmark index during the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
