The lira strengthened, heading for
its highest in six days, and erased earlier losses after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled officials
are prepared to do whatever is needed to preserve the euro. Bond
yields fell.  The lira gained 0.3 percent to 1.8171 per dollar at 3:41
p.m., erasing a 0.5 percent loss spurred by Governor Erdem Basci, who may narrow the central bank’s interest-rate corridor
as he shifts to a new monetary policy based on  reserve
requirements . Yields fell eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 7.81 percent in their second day of declines.  Draghi’s comments suggest the ECB may intervene in bond
markets as surging yields in Spain and  Italy  threaten the 17-
nation currency bloc’s existence. The corridor where Turkey’s
central bank lends between 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent daily
will probably lose its relevance within two months, Basci said
in Ankara today. Turkey sends about 40 percent of its exports to
the European Union.  “With markets fearing that Spain and Italy will soon need
a bailout, speculations about a break-down of the currency union
have gained traction lately,”Thu Lan Nguyen, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in e-mailed
comments. “Draghi is indicating that this will not happen.”  “A lot of people will bank on the  European Central Bank  to
pretty much ‘monetize’ the problem away. That this will have
severe long term consequences too is basically being ignored.
But right now, it is definitely spurring risk appetite which is
beneficial for the lira,” Nguyen said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
