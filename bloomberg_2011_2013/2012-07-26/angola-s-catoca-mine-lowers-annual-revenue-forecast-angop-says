OAO Alrosa’s Catoca diamond mine in
 Angola  lowered its annual revenue forecast to $400 million from
$500 million to $550 million,  Agencia Angola Press  reported,
citing the director of the company’s joint venture in the
country.  Jose Ganga Jr. said he revised the company’s revenue
forecast after diamond sales dropped about 5 percent in the
first half of the year, citing the financial crisis in  Europe 
and the U.S., according to the Luanda-based  news agency .  Catoca, a mine near the northeastern town of Saurimo,
currently produces an average of 500,000 carats a month, Ganga
Jr. said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
