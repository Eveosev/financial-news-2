For-profit college company shares
fell today after  ITT Educational Services Inc. (ESI)  and  Strayer
Education Inc. (STRA)  said student enrollment declined in the second
quarter.  ITT Educational sank 15 percent at the close in  New York  to
$42.78, the biggest loss since January 2008, and Strayer slid 12
percent to $79.44, the most in a year. The 13-member  Bloomberg
Education Index (USEDU)  fell 5.1 percent.  The for-profit colleges industry has suffered falling
enrollment amid student reluctance to take on more debt and
federal and state investigations of recruitment and marketing
practices.  ITTâ€™s new student enrollment dropped 9.5 percent, while
total student enrollment fell 16 percent, the Carmel, Indiana-
based company said today in a statement. Net income declined 42
percent as revenue fell 15 percent.  Total enrollment at Strayer fell 7 percent, the Herndon,
Virginia-based company said in a statement. Second-quarter
revenue decreased by 11 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
