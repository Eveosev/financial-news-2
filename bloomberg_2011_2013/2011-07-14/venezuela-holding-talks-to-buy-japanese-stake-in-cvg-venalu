Venezuela ’s government started talks
to acquire a 20 percent stake in state aluminum producer CVG
Venalum from six Japanese companies, the Ministry of Basic
Industries said today in a statement.  The government is seeking to buy the stake from  Showa Denko
KK (4004) ,  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) ,  Marubeni Corp. (8002) , Sumitomo Chemical Co.,
 Mitsubishi Materials Corp. (5711)  and Mitsubishi Aluminum Co., the
ministry said.  State mining company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana,
which is known as CVG, currently has an 80 percent stake in
Venalum, according to its website.  Venezuela’s government expects to have a formal negotiating
committee set up in August and aims to have an agreement in
place within four months, the ministry said. Kobe Steel on May
23 said it reached an agreement to transfer all of its shares in
Comsigua, a Venezuelan producer of hot briquetted iron that was
nationalized in 2009, to CVG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
