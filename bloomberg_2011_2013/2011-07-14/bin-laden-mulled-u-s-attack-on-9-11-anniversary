Captured al-Qaeda documents from the
May 2 commando raid that killed Osama  bin Laden  indicate he was
plotting a strike against the U.S. to mark the 10th anniversary
of the Sept. 11 attacks, according to a U.S. official.  The planning never got beyond the discussion stage between
Bin Laden and his operations chief Attiyah abd al-Rahman, said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he
isn’t authorized to speak about the matter.  The Wall Street Journal published a report on the
discussions earlier today.  Bin Laden repeatedly rejected individuals who al-Rahman
suggested should be part of the assault team, the U.S. official
said. Though there is no indication of an active plot in the
works, al-Rahman is still alive and is considered dangerous, the
official said, adding that bin Laden’s goal of conducting a 10th
anniversary attack was his hope and hadn’t reached the detail
stage.  The materials seized from bin Laden’s compound in
Abbottabad,  Pakistan , show he was still involved in planning and
directing al-Qaeda activities and who should be involved, the
official said.  The Central Intelligence Agency last month completed its
analysis of the documents and computer taken by Navy Seals
during their raid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
