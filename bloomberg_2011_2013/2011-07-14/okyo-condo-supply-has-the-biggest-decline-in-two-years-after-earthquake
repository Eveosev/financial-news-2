The number of condominiums offered
for sale in  Tokyo  and surrounding areas in June had the biggest
decline in more than two years following the country’s
magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami.  The number of new condominiums put on the market last month
unexpectedly fell 33 percent from a year earlier,  the Real
Estate Economic Research Institute  said in a report released in
Tokyo today. Last time when the monthly data had a bigger
decline was in March 2009 when it dropped 46 percent.  The institute lowered its annual forecast for apartments
put up for sale to 45,000 units from 50,000 as some developers
may delay sales of apartments due to a slump in the market.  The average price for apartments in the Tokyo region, which
includes the surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and
Kanagawa, fell 4.5 percent to 45.1 million yen ($567,000),
today’s report showed.  The Topix Real Estate Index, measuring 44 property-related
stocks, fell after the data was released and closed 0.7 percent
lower as of the 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
