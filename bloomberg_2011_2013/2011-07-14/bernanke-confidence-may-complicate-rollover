Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said that a loss of investor confidence could
complicate the rollover of the U.S. government’s debt.  “It is entirely possible that loss of confidence or
political risk could raise interest rates and make it more
difficult or expensive to roll over the debt,” Bernanke said in
comments today at a Senate Banking Committee hearing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
