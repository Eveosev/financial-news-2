Uganda’s shilling headed for the
biggest rally in two weeks against the dollar as exporters
brought the U.S. currency into the East African nation,
according to the local unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
appreciated for a third day, gaining 0.6 percent to 2,575 per
dollar by 1:22 p.m. in Kampala, the capital. That would be the
largest gain on a closing-price basis since July 1, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There has been a bit of subdued customer demand for the
dollar and we have seen small inflows from exports,” Benon
Okwenje, a currency trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd., said by
phone from Kampala.  To contact the reporter on this story:
