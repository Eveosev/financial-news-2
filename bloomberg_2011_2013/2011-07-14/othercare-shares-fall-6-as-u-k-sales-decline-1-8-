Mothercare Plc (MTC) , a children’s clothes
and homeware retailer which operates 1,289 stores worldwide,
dropped 1.4 percent in London trading after U.K. sales fell.  Shares earlier fell by as much as 6 percent, before closing
5.6 pence down at 405 pence, giving the company a market value
of 358.8 million pounds ($578 million).  The company said U.K. sales fell 1.8 percent for the 15
weeks to July 9 in a statement this morning. Sales in U.K.
stores open for at least a year fell 4.3 percent. Strong
overseas growth pushed global sales to 6.7 percent, the Watford,
England-based company said. International revenue rose 15.2
percent.  Chief Executive Officer Ben Gordon said in a telephone
interview he expected same-store U.K. sales to continue to
decline for the rest of the fiscal year, citing “weak  consumer
spending  and competitive market conditions.”  The company’s plan to close 110 of its 362 U.K. town-center
outlets is progressing well, with 80 stores to be closed this
year, Gordon said.  Mothercare’s overseas performance is “incredibly
exciting,” Gordon said, citing strong growth in  Asia , Australia
and the  Middle East .  To contact the reporter on this story:
