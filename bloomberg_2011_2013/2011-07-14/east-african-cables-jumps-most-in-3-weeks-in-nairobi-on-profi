East African Cables Ltd. (EACL) , the
region’s biggest cable manufacturer, jumped the most in five
months after announcing a profit in the half year through June
compared with a loss a year earlier.  The stock advanced 1.05 shillings, or 9.1 percent, to 12.55
shillings as of the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the largest gain
since Feb. 9. The shares are down 3.5 percent so far in 2011.  Net income was 172.3 million shillings ($1.92 million)
compared with a loss of 57 million shillings a year earlier, the
Nairobi-based company said today in a statement in the Daily
Nation newspaper. Revenue climbed to 2.35 billion shillings from
1.83 billion shillings a year earlier.  “The growth in operating results was driven by increased
sales in the regional market as well as recovery of our
Tanzanian subsidiary,” the statement said.  Directors declared an interim dividend of 0.30 shillings a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
