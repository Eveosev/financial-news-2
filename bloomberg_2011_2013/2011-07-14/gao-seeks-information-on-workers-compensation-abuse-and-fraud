Congressional investigators are
seeking tips on possible fraud by federal employees who are
collecting workers’ compensation benefits.  The Government Accountability Office, Congress’s
investigative arm, is collecting information about schemes such
as a beneficiary working a second job, overstating a
compensation claim, or collecting benefits owed to a deceased
person, according to a  statement  posted today on its website.  The agency is examining fraud and abuse in the  Federal
Employees Compensation Act  program, which in fiscal year 2009
paid benefits to 253,000 workers for injuries and illnesses. The
probe, part of the GAO’s ongoing FraudNet effort, is similar to
the agency’s reporting mechanism involving small-business
programs, said Chuck Young, a GAO spokesman.  In 2009, the U.S. Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs
paid over $4.1 billion in four programs, according to a Labor
Department report. Of the total, $2.73 billion was spent on
almost 253,000 federal workers or their survivors, according to
the report.  The federal office also oversees benefit programs for coal
miners with black lung, injured maritime and harbor workers and
employees of the Energy Department exposed to radiation.  The GAO will keep all information about those who contact
the government confidential, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
