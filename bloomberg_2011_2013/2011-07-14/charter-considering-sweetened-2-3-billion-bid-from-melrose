Charter International Plc (CHTR) , the
British maker of welding equipment, said it’s considering a
sweetened takeover approach from  Melrose Plc (MRO)  that values the
business at about 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).  Melrose, the U.K. investment firm run by a former team at
industrial company Wassall Plc, increased its cash-and-share bid
to 840 pence, Charter said in a statement today. That’s 37
percent higher than its pre-approach closing price, and compares
with an initial proposal of 780 pence made on June 29.  The approach comes as the welding and automation-equipment
maker is in a state of flux after the sudden departure of Chief
Executive Officer Michael Foster in June. The company, which is
searching for a new CEO, on June 20 signaled full-year profit
will be below earlier forecasts and announced a fresh wave of
cost cutting.  “They are not as hostile, they don’t seem to reject it
outright this time, so it obviously has a better chance of
succeeding,” said Jo Reedman, an analyst at Singer Capital
Markets Ltd., which is reviewing its Charter rating.  Charter urged shareholders to await further advice from the
board and added that the proposal is conditional on financing
and due diligence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
