Colombia ’s peso rose to almost a
three-year high on record foreign investment flows and as
companies continue to repatriate overseas revenue to pay local
taxes this month.  The peso gained 0.6 percent to 1,747.8 per dollar at 10:17
a.m. New York time, from 1,757.8 yesterday. The peso has jumped
9.7 percent since March 1, the best performance among 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Colombia’s foreign credit rating was upgraded to the lowest
level of investment grade by  Standard & Poor’s  in March, Moody’s
Investors Service in May and Fitch Ratings in June.  “First of all, this has to do with Colombia’s investment
grade ratings, which have generated a flow of portfolio
investment,” said Francisco Chavez, analyst at Corredores
Asociados SA. “Large foreign and local companies are bringing
dollars from abroad to pay their taxes.”  Tax payments were concentrated last month and some
continued making payments this month after President  Juan Manuel Santos  pushed back tax deadlines through the end of June for
large taxpayers affected by a year of heavy rains, Chavez said.  Foreign direct investment jumped to $5.75 billion in the
first five months of 2011 from a year earlier, with 86 percent
going into oil and mining, according to the central bank. That
compares with $3.68 billion in the first five months of 2010.
Foreign investment into stocks and bonds jumped eight-fold to
$841 million in the same period this year.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.79 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price fell 0.25
centavo to 117.682 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
