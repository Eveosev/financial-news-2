Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.,  China ’s
largest hypermarket operator, said its  Hong Kong  trading debut
will be delayed to July 27 instead of today because of an error
in its IPO prospectus.  The retailer, which raised HK$7.97 billion ($1 billion)
this month in an initial public offering, clarified historical
earnings per share and asked investors to confirm their
applications by July 20, in a filing today to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
