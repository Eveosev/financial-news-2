Gindalbie Metals Ltd. (GBG) , an Australian
iron ore developer, may raise as much as A$450 million ($484
million) in a share sale to finish building its A$2.6 billion
Karara project, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc analysts said.  The sale may range between A$150 million and A$250 million,
with a “worst case scenario” of A$450 million if no debt is
secured, RBS analysts led by Todd Scott said in a note yesterday.
A share sale “could be imminent,” they said.  “To cover its share of the estimated increased
construction cost, Gindalbie is considering equity
alternatives,” Michael Weir, a spokesman for Perth-based
Gindalbie said in an e-mail. “The company is expected to be in
a position to make a decision on the funding strategy for stage
one of the Karara project soon.”  Gindalbie, which is developing the mine with Anshan Iron &
Steel Group of  China , may get help from its partner in obtaining
loans from Chinese banks, Scott said. An estimated A$1.3 billion
already has been spent on the project, he said.  Gindalbie rose 0.7 percent to 75.5 cents at 2:52 p.m. in
Sydney trading, trimming its decline this year to 46 percent.  The company on June 29 announced a cost overrun of about
A$600 million for the project in  Western Australia ’s Mid-West
region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
