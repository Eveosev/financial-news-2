Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s second-
largest mining company, said iron ore and coking coal production
rose in the second quarter, recovering from Australian floods
that disrupted operations in the previous three months.  Iron-ore production climbed 12 percent from a year earlier
to 48.9 million metric tons, Rio said today in a  statement . That
compares with estimates of 49.4 million tons from Credit Suisse
Group AG and 45.8 million tons from UBS AG.  Heavy rain in  Western Australia  slowed mining in the first
quarter and curbed shipments from the country, the biggest
exporter of iron ore and coal. Rio Tinto plans to expand its
Australian iron ore operations 50 percent by 2015 at a cost of
about $14.8 billion as increasing Chinese demand drives up
prices for the steelmaking ingredient.  “After a poor quarter in the first quarter, largely
attributed to one-off weather-related disruptions, Rio Tinto has
delivered a stronger production performance,”  Paul Galloway , a
London-based analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd., wrote in a
report today. “Iron ore and thermal coal now appear to be back
on track, but coking coal production was still low.”  Rio fell 1.2 percent to 4,387.5 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close of  London  trading. The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  declined 1
percent. The company’s Sydney-traded stock was unchanged at
A$80.95 by the close of the Australian stock exchange.  ‘Largely Recovered’  “Operations largely recovered from the severe weather
impacts earlier this year, although some port and rail
constraints remained,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese
said in the statement. “This quarter was also characterized by
continued strong prices for most of our metals and minerals, but
with worsening adverse exchange rates and some input cost
pressures.”  Weather disruptions in  Australia  will cut underlying
earnings at Rio Tinto’s Alcan unit by about $130 million in the
first half, the company said in the statement.  This is “due to lost alumina tonnage and higher costs in
mining, refining and power generation, with a smaller impact
continuing into the second half of 2011,” Rio said.  The company’s iron ore unit will provide about two-thirds
of Rio’s earnings for the next two to three years, Credit Suisse
said yesterday in a note to clients. The unit posted earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $16.6
billion last year.  ‘Elevated Levels’  Rio began output from its 22 million-ton-a-year Brockman 4
mine in July 2010 and approved a $1.2 billion expansion of the
site in December to boost annual capacity to 40 million tons.  The company cut its forecast for  iron ore  production this
year by 1.6 percent to 240 million tons, from an April 13
estimate of 244 million tons. The figure refers to 100 percent
of output from projects, rather than Rio’s share.  “Iron ore production will continue to surge ahead for the
next four years as Rio continues to execute flawless delivery in
its ramp up to 333 million tons a year by the first half of
2015,” Liberum Capital Ltd. said in a note. “This growth alone
is justification enough to own Rio Tinto here above all other
diversifieds.”  The price of iron ore is likely to remain at “elevated
levels” near $160 to $170 a ton for three to five years, MF
Global said in a report last week. The benchmark price of ore
for immediate delivery to  China  advanced 0.6 percent to $174.10
a ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index.  Copper Concern  “In our view, the biggest cause for concern at Rio is
copper,” Bernstein’s Galloway said. “This decline appears to
be structural, as lower grades at major operations were the
cause of reduced output and there is little prospect of
improvement in the short-term.”  Rio’s mined copper production fell 24 percent from a year
earlier to 127,200 tons, with output from the Escondida mine
dropping 31 percent to 56,100 tons on lower grades of the
mineral, it said. Output from the Kennecott Utah operation fell
17 percent to 45,600 tons.  The company’s estimate of full-year copper output was
unchanged at 539,000 tons. Total refined copper production for
the quarter fell 1 percent to 89,900 tons, it said.  Alumina output was unchanged at 2.2 million tons, while
aluminum rose 1 percent to 958,000 tons. Coking coal production
dropped 26 percent to 1.8 million tons and semi-soft coal output
fell 31 percent. Thermal coal production rose 5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
