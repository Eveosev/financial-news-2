Ghana, Africa’s newest oil exporter,
raised its budget deficit target to 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product for 2011 as higher crude earnings allow the
government to boost spending.  The shortfall compares with a previous target of 4.1
percent, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  told lawmakers in the
capital, Accra, today. The fiscal gap will narrow from 6.5
percent of GDP in 2010 as oil earnings help to boost revenue.  Ghana’s economy is forecast to expand 14 percent this year,
the fastest in Africa, after oil production began in December,
according to the  International Monetary Fund . Duffuor’s
supplementary budget today boosts  government spending  by 1.5
billion cedis ($989 million) to help build roads, schools and
modernize farm production.  “In spite of the need for more fiscal space resulting in
the increase in the fiscal deficit target for 2011, government
is mindful of the importance of fiscal and debt
sustainability,” Duffuor said.  The revenue target was raised by 1.37 billion cedis to 12
billion cedis for this year because of higher-than-projected oil
earnings, the minister said. The supplementary budget assumes an
oil price of $100 a barrel, up from $70 previously, resulting in
estimated crude revenue of 1.3 billion cedis, he said. Oil
production is expected to reach 84,737 barrels a day.  Jubilee Field  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , operator of the Jubilee offshore oil field,
expects daily production to 120,000 barrels per day by next
month or September from 80,000 barrels per day at the start of
July. The  Finance Ministry  last year projected oil revenue of
584 million cedis for 2011. About half of that will be channeled
to the state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  The government has to “balance higher spending as a result
of the higher revenue with their broader medium-term fiscal
consolidation plans,”  Razia Khan , head of Africa economic
research at Standard Chartered Plc in  London , said in an e-mail.
“Getting that balance right, especially with elections in 2012,
is going to be key.”  The cedi fell as much as 0.4 percent to 1.5225 against the
dollar today, paring its gain since Feb. 1 to 2.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
