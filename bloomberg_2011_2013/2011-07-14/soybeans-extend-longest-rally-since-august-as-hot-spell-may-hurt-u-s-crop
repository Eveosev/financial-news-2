Soybeans rose, extending the longest
rally since August, on speculation that unusually hot weather
during the next month will curb crop yields in the U.S., the
world’s biggest grower and exporter.  Temperatures  will be as much as 12 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal for five days starting July 16 in the Midwest, the main
growing region, before cooler weather and rain return, the
 National Weather Service  said. July may rank as the sixth
warmest since 1960, T-Storm Weather LLC said in a report.
Soybean prices are up 7 percent this month.  “The markets are focused on the heat next week,” Jim Riley, a broker for the Linn Group, said by telephone from
Chicago. “There’s some reluctance to add to long positions
after the recent rally and the potential for the forecasts to
change.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 4.25 cents, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $13.84 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the ninth straight gain and the longest
rally since August. Earlier, the oilseed reached $13.895, the
highest since June 10. The commodity has gained 44 percent in
the past year.  Prices also rose on increased demand for U.S. supplies for
delivery after the harvest this year, Riley said.  U.S.  exporters  sold 651,904 metric tons in the week ended
July 7 for delivery after Aug. 31, five times higher than a week
earlier, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  reported.  “Export demand improved last week,” Riley said. “We may
see a pause after the recent rally.”  China ’s imports may rise to as much as 56.6 million tons in
the marketing year beginning Oct. 1 from 51.6 million tons a
year earlier, Zhang Jinjun, a vice-general manager of oilseed at
COFCO Ltd., said at a conference in Xi’an today.  Soybeans are the second-largest U.S. crop, after corn,
valued at $38.9 billion in 2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
