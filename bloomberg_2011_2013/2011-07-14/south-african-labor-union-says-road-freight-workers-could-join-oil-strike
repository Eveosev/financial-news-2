The South African Transport and
Allied Workers Union said 65,000 members of its road freight
division may join a pay strike by workers of the country’s
petroleum industry.  Road freight workers will “mobilize solidarity support if
called upon, including marches and pickets, with the striking
members” should their wage demands go unmet, Satawu, as the
union is known, said in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
