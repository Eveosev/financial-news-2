Iraq  will raise its oil-production
as planned to 12 million barrels a day in the next few years,
even if actual production is only half that amount, depending on
market demand, an Oil Ministry spokesman said.  “The planned production capacity is 12 million barrels a
day, but we may only produce 6 million barrels a day,” Asim Jihad told state-sponsored Iraqiya television. “Iraq will
produce in accordance with global crude market needs.”  Iraq, home to the world’s fifth-biggest oil reserves, is
struggling to boost energy exports, the main source of revenue
to help rebuild an economy shattered by years of conflict,
economic sanctions and sabotage. The country has signed 15 gas
and oil licenses since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that
ousted the regime of President  Saddam Hussein .  Production will rise to 3.3 million barrels a day next year
and reach 4.5 million barrels a day by 2014, Jihad said. Export
capacity will be raised to 7 million barrels a day. The country
plans to build four or five offshore export terminals in the
south and more than 16 storage tanks to ease shipments, he said.
Iraq has also reached agreements with Turkey and  Syria  on
projects including two oil pipelines to Syria.  Iraq is now producing 2.75 million barrels a day of oil for
the first time since 2003 and is exporting 2.2 million barrels a
day, Thamir Ghadhban, chairman of the advisory commission to the
prime minister, said yesterday at a conference in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
