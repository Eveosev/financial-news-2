Stocks in Switzerland declined for a
fourth day in five after Moody’s Investors Service said the U.S.
may lose its Aaa credit rating as lawmakers debate increasing
the government’s debt limit.  Swatch Group AG, the world’s largest watch maker, slipped
1.7 percent.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s second-
biggest bank, dropped 1.1 percent.  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) , the world’s
largest offshore driller, fell 2.2 percent.  The SMI, a measure of the largest and most actively traded
companies, retreated 0.7 percent to 5,980.97 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Zurich, its lowest level in more than a week. The gauge
has tumbled 11 percent since its February high as U.S.
manufacturing and job reports missed forecasts and concern grew
that the European debt crisis is spreading. The broader Swiss
Performance Index decreased 0.8 percent today.  “The U.S. has taken the place in the front row for
markets,” said Dieter Buchholz, head of equities at Falcon Bank
Ltd. in Zurich. “The employment situation has only improved a
little and housing prices are suffering from foreclosures. A
downgrade of the U.S. would be a short-term shock. Everybody
knows the U.S. is not Aaa anymore, but the credibility of the
government would vanish.”  Moody’s began its first U.S. review since 1996 as talks to
raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit stalled, adding to concerns
that political gridlock will lead to a default. Even a temporary
default would likely have “large systemic effects” on the
economy and Treasury finances by disrupting money funds, the
repurchase-agreement market and foreign investor willingness to
buy the government’s debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Bernanke, Unemployment  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday said the
central bank is prepared to provide more stimulus if needed.  A report showed that the number of Americans filing initial
unemployment claims dropped to the lowest level since April, a
sign weakness in the labor market may be starting to abate.
Applications for jobless benefits decreased 22,000 in the week
ended July 9 to 405,000, Labor Department figures showed.
Economists had forecast 415,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Swatch declined 1.7 percent to 424.70 Swiss francs after
Credit Suisse analysts including Vincenzo Pescuma reduced their
price estimate for the stock. Cie. Financiere Richemont SA
retreated 1.4 percent to 54.65 francs.  Credit Suisse, UBS  Credit Suisse lost 1.1 percent to 30.59 francs after Dow
Jones reported that  Switzerland ’s second-largest lender plans to
cut 1,500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce.  UBS fell 0.9 percent to 13.91 francs. UBS plans to cut
costs by 1 billion francs ($1.2 billion) a year, threatening
some 5,000 jobs, Tages-Anzeiger reported today, citing
unidentified “insiders.” The bank declined to comment on the
report published today, calling it “speculation,” according to
spokesman Andreas Kern in Zurich.  Transocean slid 2.2 percent to 49.21 francs as Barclays Plc
advised selling the shares of Petrofac Ltd., a U.K.-based
oilfield services and engineering provider.  Weatherford
International Ltd. (WFT) , a Geneva-based oil rig owner, slid 3.5
percent to 15.06 francs, its largest drop in a month.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN) , Switzerland’s biggest life insurer,
retreated 1.2 percent to 127.40 francs as CA Cheuvreux cut its
2011 earnings estimate for European insurers by 15 percent.
 Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  lost 1.6 percent to 81.40 francs.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the world’s second-biggest cement maker,
dropped 2 percent to 57.75 francs as a gauge of European
construction and materials companies was among the worst
performers of the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx  Europe  600
Index, sliding 1.6 percent.  Sika AG (SIK) , Europe’s biggest maker of chemicals used in
construction, slumped 3.9 percent to 1,835 francs, the company’s
biggest retreat in more than 10 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
