Oil in New York fell, reaching a
record discount to  Brent crude , after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the Fed isn’t planning more bond-buying to
stimulate economic growth.  Futures dropped 2.4 percent after Bernanke told Congress
that the central bank would be cautious about initiating a third
round of quantitative easing because of higher inflation this
year. Oil climbed as much as 0.8 percent earlier when the Labor
Department said applications for  unemployment benefits  decreased
22,000 to 405,000 last week.  “The Bernanke comments took away some of the speculation
that the Fed was about to commence with a third round of
quantitative easing,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of
research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “The comment had an immediate
impact on both oil and the dollar.”  Crude oil for August delivery declined $2.36 to settle at
$95.69 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract dropped as much as $3.52. Oil has risen 23 percent in
the past year.  Crude’s discount to Brent widened to $22.63 a barrel,
exceeding the previous record of $22.29 set June 15. Brent for
August settlement fell 46 cents, or 0.4 percent, to expire at
$118.32 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The more actively traded September futures declined
$1.59, or 1.3 percent, to settle at $116.26.  “We’re not prepared at this point to take further
action,” Bernanke said today, in response to a question from
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a Democrat from
 South Dakota .  Mixed Signals  Bernanke signaled yesterday that the Fed has more tools for
monetary easing. He said the central bank could keep  interest
rates  at a record low and hold its balance sheet at $2.87
trillion for a longer period. It may also buy more bonds,
increase the average maturity of its securities holdings or cut
the interest rate it pays banks on their reserves, he said.  “People are reassessing what is going to happen with
quantitative easing,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron
Hanover Inc., a trading advisory company in  New Canaan ,
 Connecticut . “It seems Bernanke has put conditions on any
additional easing, which make it unlikely in the short term.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent to
1,308.87 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.4 percent
to 12,437.12 at 4:04 p.m. in  New York .  Moody’s Review  Moody’s put the U.S. on review for the first time since
1996 as concern grew that political gridlock will lead to
default. The American government has held an Aaa rating with
Moody’s since 1917.  President  Barack Obama  may summon congressional leaders to
a Camp David summit this weekend after the latest round of White
House negotiations on the deficit deal ended on a tense note.
Obama “got very agitated” and left the room after House
Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  suggested a vote on a smaller deal,
Cantor said in an interview.  “The market is hanging onto every word Bernanke says,”
said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence
Investment Management in  St. Louis . “The budget impasse is
looking more and more like a train wreck. It looks like this
will go right down to the wire.”  Economists forecast the Labor Department would report
415,000 claims for jobless claims today, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. U.S. wholesale costs
dropped more than forecast in June, the department said in a
separate report.  Weaker Demand  “There was strength earlier on the jobs number but the
Bernanke comments changed that,” Beutel said. “We may be
seeing a delayed reaction to yesterday’s demand number.”  Total U.S. fuel demand dropped 0.4 percent to an average
18.9 million barrels a day over the past four weeks, 1.4 percent
lower than the same period last year, an Energy Department
report showed yesterday. Gasoline consumption slipped 1 percent
to an average 9.23 million barrels a day over the past four
weeks, 0.9 percent lower than a year earlier.  Gasoline for August delivery declined 2.68 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.1248 a gallon in New York.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
increase crude loadings this month, according to tanker-tracker
Oil Movements. The group will ship 22.99 million barrels a day
in the four weeks to July 30, up 0.7 percent from last month,
the Halifax, England-based consultant said today. They calculate
shipments by keeping a tally of tanker-rental agreements.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 742,866
contracts as of 3:42 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 718,474
contracts yesterday, 5.8 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts, the most
since June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
