BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , the world’s
largest poultry exporter, jumped to the highest in two months
after analysts boosted stock ratings following Brazilian
regulatory approval for its $3.8 billion Sadia SA acquisition.  Brasil Foods rose 1.15 reais, or 4 percent, to 29.70 reais
at the close of  Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time,
the highest since May 16. The stock surged 9.8 yesterday on the
conditional regulatory approval.  The conditions to approve the deal were “much milder than
expected,” Banco BTG Pactual SA analysts Fabio Monteiro and
Thiago Duarte, who increased the stock’s rating to “buy” from
“neutral,” said in a note to clients today.  Brazil ’s regulator, known as Cade, ordered the Sao Paulo-
based company yesterday to sell some assets and stop using
Perdigao, one of its top brands, and the Batavo brand on meat
products for as long as five years.  As part of the accord,  Brasil Foods  will also have to sell
10 food-processing plants, 12 other brands, eight distribution
centers and four pork and chicken slaughterhouses. The
suspension and divestitures will affect 13 percent of the
company’s operating revenue and 12 percent of its sales volumes,
Brasil Foods said yesterday in a regulatory filing.  The world’s largest poultry exporter was raised to
“outperform” from “neutral” by Credit Suisse Group AG
analyst Marcel de Moraes today. Raymond James equity analyst
 Daniela Bretthauer  raised the rating to “market perform” from
“underperform” yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
