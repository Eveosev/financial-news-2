Thailand ’s Chamber of Commerce said
the incoming government’s plan to raise the daily  minimum wage 
to 300 baht ($9.96) may erode the nation’s export
competitiveness and curb foreign investment.  The wage increase may force some small- and medium-sized
businesses to fire workers or shut down, and the government
should prepare measures to help companies, Pongsak Assakul, vice
chairman of the group, said at a briefing in Bangkok today.  The increase in the minimum wage may cost businesses about
190 billion baht per year, said Thanavath Phonvichai, an
economist at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.  The Pheu Thai party, which won a majority in the July 3
general election, plans to raise wages by as much as 99 percent
in some parts of the country next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
