The European Union will import
64,364 metric tons of sugar at a reduced duty rate under the
first of five planned tenders to alleviate tight supplies,
according to the European Commission, the EU’s regulatory arm.  The bloc backed a proposal in May to import the sweetener
at a reduced rate and authorized duty-free imports of 200,000
tons of sugar to ease supplies in the region. The EU allowed
300,000 tons of imports at zero duty earlier this year, bringing
the total to 500,000 tons.  Raw sugar imports under the first tender will total 56,644
tons, while white sugar will account for 7,700 tons, and an
additional 20 tons will be composed of “other sugars,” the
commission said in an e-mailed statement.  The lowest duty to be paid will be 131.11 euros ($185.77) a
ton, on 55,000 tons of raw-sugar for refining, while the highest
will be 217 euros a ton on the 7,700 tons of white sugar, it
said.  The decision will be published in the Official Journal
tomorrow. The next tender will be decided on July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
