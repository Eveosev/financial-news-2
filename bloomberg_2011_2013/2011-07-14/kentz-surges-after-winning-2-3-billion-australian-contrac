Kentz Corp., an Irish oil and gas
engineering company whose customers include  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) 
and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , rose to a record in London trading
after winning a $2.3 billion contract in  Australia .  Kentz advanced 6.6 percent to 494.5 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close, the highest price since the shares were first sold in
February 2008. The stock is up 54 percent this year.  The Clonmel, Ireland-based company said in a statement it
won a contract for a joint venture with Chicago Bridge & Iron
Company NV, or  CB&I , at the  Chevron Corp (CVX) .-led Gorgon liquefied
natural gas project on Western Australia’s Barrow Island.  Kentz, which had an order backlog of about $1.6 billion at
the end of April, said last month it was bidding on further
contracts at the Gorgon LNG and Pluto LNG projects in Australia.
Energy companies including Chevron and Shell are investing in
Australian LNG ventures to meet a projected increase in Asian
demand for cleaner-burning alternatives to coal.  “This is an excellent project win for Kentz, lifting the
backlog by almost 50 percent and providing good earnings
visibility through 2013-2014,”  Keith Morris , a London-based
analyst at Evolution Securities Ltd., wrote in a report.  Kentz holds a 35 percent interest in the CB&I-Kentz joint
venture, and the contract includes support for the construction
of three LNG trains, or processing units, with a total capacity
of 15 million tons a year.  CB&I rose 3.7 percent to $40.05 in New York trading at
11:29 a.m. local time.  “The contract commences immediately and is due to run
until 2015 with peak activity in 2013 and 2014 and therefore the
biggest impact on joint-venture profit contribution,” Morris
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
