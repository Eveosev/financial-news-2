OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , a Russian coal
producer, said its output of the raw material fell 5 percent to
1.68 million metric tons in the second quarter as an accident
suspended operations at one of its mines in the period.  The company sold 904,000 tons of coking coal concentrate in
the quarter, down from 935,000 tons in the prior three months,
it said in an e-mailed statement today. The average sales price
rose to $174 a ton from $147 and the company agreed to maintain
that price in the current quarter, according to the statement.  Raspadskaya, jointly owned by the company’s management and
billionaire Roman Abramovich’s steelmaker  Evraz Group SA (EVR) , is
also struggling to restore output after explosions in May 2010
that tore through its main Raspadskaya mine in Siberia, halting
output for half a year. The owners have hired Deutsche Bank AG
and Morgan Stanley to find a buyer for their 80 percent, two
people with knowledge of the plans said March 10.  VEB, Russia’s state development bank, said yesterday it had
been approached by potential buyers seeking funds for the deal.  Raspadskaya aims to restart part of its main mine in August
after missing plans to resume operations last quarter because of
a delay in regulatory approval, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
