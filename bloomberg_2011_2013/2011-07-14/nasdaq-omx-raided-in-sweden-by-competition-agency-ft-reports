Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  was raided in
Sweden last month by government inspectors probing whether the
company is impeding competition among Nordic exchanges, the
Financial Times reported, citing the Swedish regulator. The
information was made public this week, the newspaper said.  U.S. telecommunication company  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
is also part of the investigation, after complaints last year by
Burgundy, a trading platform backed by Nordic banks and brokers,
that it colluded with Nasdaq OMX to bar other exchange operators
from a  data center , the FT said.  “We can confirm that we are cooperating with the
competition authorities,” Frank De Maria, a spokesman for New
York-based Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., wrote in an e-mail.  “Verizon is cooperating with the competition authority,
but we do not comment on ongoing investigations, or customer
activities,” said Peter Lucht, Verizon’s executive director for
global public relations, in an e-mailed statement.  The Swedish Competition Authority said in a  statement  on
its website that it visited financial-sector companies to gather
information as part of the inquiry.  “These visits comprise a step in the search for evidence
that may support suspicions of possible anti-competitive
cooperation or abuse of dominant position,” the Swedish agency
said in its statement. “The gathered material is analyzed and
investigation will reveal whether there has been any
contravention of the law.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
