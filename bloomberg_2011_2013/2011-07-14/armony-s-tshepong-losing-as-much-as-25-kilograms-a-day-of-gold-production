Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s
third-largest gold producer, may lose between 20 kilograms and
25 kilograms of gold a day because of the closure of its
Tshepong mine in  South Africa  following an accident on July 11
in which a worker died.  “Operations at Tshepong are halted until such time as the
investigation into the cause of the accident has been
finalized,” Johannesburg-based Harmony said in an e-mailed
response to questions today.  “The loss of a life is of greater  concern to us than the loss of production.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
