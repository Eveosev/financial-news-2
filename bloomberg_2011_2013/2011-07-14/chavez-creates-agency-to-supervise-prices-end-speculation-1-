Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
signed a price regulation law today that he said will create a
new government agency to supervise the price at which goods are
sold and “end speculation.”  Chavez said he was creating a “fair price and costs” law
to stop speculators from “pillaging” Venezuelans and running
off with the majority of the profits.  “This is another law to fight against the injustice of
capitalism, to protect the people, the whole nation -- except
the exploiters and speculators, of course, who monopolize
production, hoard, hide and inflate prices and costs,” Chavez
said in comments carried on state television.  Chavez blames price gouging for fueling inflation in
Venezuela, which at 23.6 percent is the highest among 78
economies tracked by Bloomberg. The government already controls
the price of more than 100 basic food goods.  Nicmer Evans, a political analyst at the Central University
of  Venezuela  who headed up a commission last December to assess
the law, said the idea is to tackle inflation at its roots.  “There’s a culture among Venezuelan businesses of wanting
to earn no less than 50 percent and with expectations of between
100 and 150 percent over the original price,” he said in phone
interview May 3, when the plan for the law was first announced.
“The idea is not to tackle inflation’s consequences but rather
the causes.”  The price regulation agency will set maximum profit
margins, Evans said. Each product will be assessed on merit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
