Europe ’s oldest surviving bound book
has become the focus of a U.K. fundraising campaign, with the
 British Library  seeking 2.75 million pounds ($4.4 million) to
complete its acquisition of the 9-million-pound Gospel of Saint
John.  The 7th-century book, smaller than a paperback and with its
original red leather binding, was buried with St. Cuthbert, an
English Christian leader, in the year 698. It stayed in his tomb
for four centuries before it was found there in 1104. It was
shown to reporters in a boardroom of the library.  “This is the oldest book as we know it” in Europe, said
Scot McKendrick, the British Library’s head of history and
classical studies. “It’s small, it’s portable and it’s hand
sized.”  Half of the money for the book has been given by the
government-funded  National Heritage Memorial Fund . Other donors,
including the  Art Fund  and the Garfield Weston Foundation, have
given another 1.75 million pounds.  The book has been on long-term loan to the library since
1979. The library was given the first chance at acquiring it
when it was approached last year by Christie’s, on behalf of the
Society of Jesus (British Province). The Society is seeking
funds to repair church buildings.  While the work was on loan, the library could not invest
taxpayers’ money in its conservation, nor digitize it or make it
accessible on the Web, British Library Chief Executive Lynne Brindley said in an interview.  To contact the writer on the story:
