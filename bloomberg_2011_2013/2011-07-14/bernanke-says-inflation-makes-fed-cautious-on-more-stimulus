Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said inflation now is “higher” and “closer” to the
central bank’s informal target than was the case in August.  Bernanke in comments today at a Senate Banking Committee
hearing said the increase in inflation this year is one reason
why the Fed won’t immediately embark on a third round of bond-
buying.  “We’re not prepared at this point to take further
action,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
