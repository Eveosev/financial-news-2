The London Metropolitan Police
agreed that its hiring of former News of the World editor Neil
Wallis should be reviewed after Mayor of London  Boris Johnson 
had a “very frank discussion” with Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson, a spokesperson for Johnson’s office said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Stephenson agreed with Johnson that Lord Justice Brian Leveson, who’s been appointed to lead the independent review of
the phone-hacking scandal, should probe the hiring arrangements
of Wallis as the public needs to be reassured that “this was
not inappropriate,” the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
