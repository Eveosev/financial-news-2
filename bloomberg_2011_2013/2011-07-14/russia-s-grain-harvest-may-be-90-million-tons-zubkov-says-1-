Russia ’s grain harvest may be 90
million metric tons in 2011 with exports this month at 1.5
million tons, First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said.  Wheat prices in  Chicago , a global benchmark, have dropped
13 percent since Russia announced on May 28 the end of the
export ban. As of yesterday, Russia harvested 7.5 million tons
of grains and exported 770,000 tons, Zubkov said in Moscow.  “This year will be more favorable for us in the grain
sector,” Zubkov said in Moscow.  Last month, Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  forecast the
grain crop at 85 million tons. Zubkov estimated in May that
grain exports would be 15 million tons. That equals about 1.25
million tons a month over 12 months.  Last year, Russia harvested 60.9 million tons of grain and
exported 4 million tons before the ban was imposed because of
the worst drought in 50 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
