Australian homeowners are more
pessimistic about the housing market as falling prices and
slowing rental growth reel in growth expectations, a  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  poll showed.  Home prices  fell 2 percent in the second quarter and rental
growth slowed to 1.3 percent,  Australia ’s fourth-largest lender
said in an e-mailed report. Home prices are expected to decline
1.4 percent over the next year, compared with growth of 0.5
percent predicted in the bank’s March quarter survey.  “House buyers continue to cite tight credit conditions as
a major constraint in buying property,” National Australia said
in the report. Higher interest rates are also concerning buyers,
the bank said.  Australian consumer confidence in July fell by the most
since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in 2008 as concern
intensified about the European debt crisis and the domestic
growth outlook weakened. Australia has the developed world’s
highest  interest rates  after seven increases from October 2009
and November 2010.  Prices are expected to rise 0.5 percent by June 2013, while
rents climb by 4.4 percent over the next two years.  The bank’s residential property index, which measures home
price expectations among owners and the real estate industry,
fell to minus 5 points in the three months to June 30, from 16
points the previous quarter. NAB surveyed real estate agents and
managers, property owners and investors, developers, fund and
asset managers and valuers across Australia for the quarterly
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
