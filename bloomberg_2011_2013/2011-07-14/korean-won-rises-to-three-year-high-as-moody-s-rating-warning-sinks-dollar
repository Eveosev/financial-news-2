South  Korea ’s won climbed to its
strongest level in almost three years after Moody’s Investors
Service put the U.S. debt rating on review for possible
downgrade, curbing demand for dollars.  The Asian currency strengthened for a second day and
 government bonds  advanced after the Bank of Korea today kept the
seven-day repurchase rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, citing the
need to monitor the threat posed by  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis. The dollar declined against all 16 of the most-used
currencies after Moody’s put the nation’s Aaa rating on review
for the first time since 1995.  “The global weakness of the dollar is becoming more
pronounced, powering the won higher,” said Kim Sung Soon,
Seoul-based senior currency trader with state-run Industrial
 Bank of Korea . “The market isn’t likely to react to a rate
decision unless there’s a surprise increase again.”  The won strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,058.45 per dollar as
of the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,054.10, the strongest level since August
2008.  The Bank of Korea has already raised  interest rates  three
times this year to quell inflation. Central bank data showed
yesterday lending to households increased by 3.4 trillion won
($3.2 billion) last month to a record 443.2 trillion won.  The yield on South Korea’s 4 percent bond due March 2016
was unchanged at 3.93 percent, according to prices from Korea
Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
