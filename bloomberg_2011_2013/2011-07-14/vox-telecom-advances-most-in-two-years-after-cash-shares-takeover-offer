(Corrects share price in second paragraph.)  Vox Telecom Ltd. (VOX)  gained the
most in more than two years after receiving a takeover
offer from a group of investors that includes Lereko Metier
Investment Holdings Ltd. and Investec Ltd.  The stock jumped 5 cents, or 13.5 percent, the biggest
one-day gain since April 2, 2009, to 42 cents, where it was
trading as of 4:14 p.m. in Johannesburg. Vox shareholders
were offered 45 cents a share or 1 share in the new company
formed after the takeover for every 10 Vox securities held
or a combination of the two.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
