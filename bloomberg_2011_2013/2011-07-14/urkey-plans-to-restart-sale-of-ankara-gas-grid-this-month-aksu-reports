Turkey ’s state asset sales agency
aims to offer the natural gas grid in Ankara for sale this month
and conclude the auction process by the end of the year, the
agency’s head said.  The agency is also waiting until July 25 to see if winning
bidders for electricity distribution grids will deposit the
collateral Turkey’s demanding, Ahmet Aksu, acting head of the
agency, said in an interview in Ankara late yesterday.
Authorities will offer grids to the second-placed bidders if the
winners fail to deposit the required collateral, he said.  The process is a legal obligation and it’s to be expected
that it causes a few months delay in the conclusion of the
sales, Aksu said.  Turkey canceled an earlier sale of the Ankara gas grid
after the winning bidders failed to make the payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
