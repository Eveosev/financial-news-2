The June drop in Slovak consumer
prices is a “one-off” phenomenon and price growth is set to
accelerate in the coming months, the central bank said.  Consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent from May, pushing the
annual inflation rate down to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent in
the previous month under European Union methodology, the
nation’s statistics office said today. The decline was driven by
a deeper-than-usual seasonal drop in food prices, the
Bratislava, Slovakia-based Narodna Banka Slovenska said on its
 website  today.  Inflation in the country, a eurozone member since 2009,
will accelerate through the end of the year because of rising
prices for natural gas and public transportation, the central
bank said, adding that the increases will affect its inflation
forecast.  In its latest quarterly forecast from June 14, the central
bank projected average inflation rate under EU methodology at
4.1 percent this year compared with 0.7 percent in 2010, driven
by  job creation  and rising commodity prices. The average rate is
set to fall to 3.3 percent next year, the bank projected last
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
