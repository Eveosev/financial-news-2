Banregio Grupo Financiero SAB, the
12th biggest Mexican bank by loans, priced its initial public
offering at 32 pesos a share, near the bottom of its marketed
range, according to two people familiar with the matter.  The company raised 1.8 billion pesos ($153.6 million)
before an overallotment option known as the greenshoe, said the
people, who couldn’t be identified because the details of the
transaction aren’t yet public. The underwriters may exercise an
option to buy additional shares within 30 days, which would
bring the offering to 2.1 billion pesos.  The sale was 2.4 times oversubscribed, the people said.  The IPO marked the first initial share sale from a
financial services firm in  Mexico  since Corp. Actinver SAB went
public in May 2010.  Banregio, based in the Monterrey suburb of San Pedro Garza
Garcia, Mexico, had planned to sell the shares within a forecast
range of 31.50 pesos to 40 pesos, according to a prospectus
filed with the stock exchange before the sale.  Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit and Grupo Financiero BBVA
Bancomer SA managed the sale.  Airline Grupo Aeromexico SAB, the last Mexican company to
hold an IPO, has lost 15 percent since it sold shares in April.
Mexican initial share listings have lost an average of 1.8
percent in their first 20 days of trading, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg since April 2010, when the country snapped
a 22-month period without a new listing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
