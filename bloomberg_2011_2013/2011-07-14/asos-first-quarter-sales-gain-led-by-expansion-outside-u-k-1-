Asos Plc (ASC) , Britain’s second-largest
online clothing retailer, reported a 63 percent increase in
first-quarter sales on growth in its international business and
said it remains “positive” for 2012.  Revenue in the three months ended June 30 climbed to 107.3
million pounds ($173 million) from 65.8 million pounds in the
same period a year earlier, the London-based company said in a
statement today. International retail sales more than doubled,
compared with a 15 percent increase in the U.K.  Asos, which targets 16- to 34-year-olds with more than
50,000 own-label and branded products, added websites in the
U.S.,  France  and  Germany  last year. International sales
accounted for 57 percent of retail sales in the quarter, up from
51 percent in the previous three months.  “The new financial year has started well,” said Chief
Executive Officer Nick Robertson. Asos is “comfortable” with
analyst estimates for full-year pretax profit of about 40
million pounds, he said in a phone interview today.  The shares rose as much as 110 pence, or 4.7 percent, to
2,460 pence and traded at 2,388 pence as of 8:27 a.m. in  London ,
giving the company a market value of 1.8 billion pounds. The
shares have risen 50 percent this year.  “Asos has got structural advantages and its long-term
international potential is untouched,” said Bank of America
Merrill Lynch analysts led by Aurelie Caspar in a note today.
The London-based team has a “buy” rating on the stock.  Asos confirmed plans for adding websites in Spain and
 Italy , said Robertson, adding that  Japan  is on the company’s
“radar.” He reiterated the company’s target for 1 billion
pounds in annual sales by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
