Taiwan’s Cabinet said it approved
rules allowing local governments to set up prostitution zones.  Detention of prostitutes will be scrapped, while fines for
illegally soliciting in a public place will be levied on both
parties to the transaction instead of just the provider, the
Cabinet said in an e-mailed statement today.  Taiwan began moves toward decriminalizing sex work in 2009
after the Constitutional Court ruled that the existing law
violated equal rights by punishing the prostitute and not the
client. The court in November 2009 ordered the Social Order
Maintenance Act to be scrapped within two years, saying that
legal sanctions for the sex trade were unnecessary because “its
harm to the interests of society was not great.”  Under the Cabinet’s new plan, prostitution would be allowed
in urban commercial zones, or non-urban districts zoned for
leisure use that are not near youth or children’s recreation
areas, according to the statement. Objections to that zoning
proposal will be attached to the draft law before being
submitted to the legislature for approval, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
