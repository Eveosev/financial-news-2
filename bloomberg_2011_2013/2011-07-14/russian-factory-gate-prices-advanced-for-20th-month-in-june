Russian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation, rose in June for a 20th straight month,
led by the mining sector and manufacturers.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 18.6
percent after a 19.2 percent advance a month earlier, the
 Federal Statistics Service  in Moscow said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median forecast of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase of 22.3 percent.  Factory-gate prices fell 2.2 percent in June from the
previous month after a 1.2 percent monthly rise in May, the
service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
