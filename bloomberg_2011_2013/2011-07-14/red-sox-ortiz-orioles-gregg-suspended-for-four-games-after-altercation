David Ortiz  of the  Boston Red Sox 
and Kevin Gregg of the  Baltimore Orioles  each received four-game
suspensions from Major League Baseball for inciting two bench-
clearing incidents in a July 8 game.  Ortiz and Gregg were also fined an undisclosed amount,
while Orioles reliever Mike Gonzalez received a three-game
suspension and manager Buck Showalter got a one-game ban.  Ortiz and Gregg swung at each other and missed after two
inside pitches by Gregg during the eighth inning of Boston’s 10-
3 win last week.  Ortiz, who hit a three-run home run in Boston’s eight-run
first inning, took several steps toward the mound after the
first inside pitch from Gregg, resulting in players from both
teams coming onto the field. Ortiz popped up the next pitch and
then went after Gregg, who later said he was shouting at
Boston’s designated hitter to run to first base. The benches
again emptied, and Ortiz and Gregg were ejected along with
Orioles reliever Jim Johnson and Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia.  Johnson and Saltalamacchia received undisclosed fines for
their “aggressive actions,” baseball said in a statement. Red
Sox pitcher John Lackey was also fined for throwing at
Baltimore’s Derrek Lee in their July 9 game.  Unless there’s an appeal, Gregg is scheduled to begin his
suspension tonight as the Orioles host the  Cleveland Indians .
Ortiz’s discipline would begin with tomorrow’s game against the
Tampa Bay Rays in St. Petersburg,  Florida .  To contact the reporter on this story:
