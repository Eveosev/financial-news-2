The ruble dropped the most in almost
three weeks against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket
after Moody’s Investors Service put the U.S. under review for a
credit-rating downgrade, damping demand for riskier emerging-
market currencies.  Russia’s currency was 0.2 percent weaker against the basket
at 33.3786 at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest
depreciation since June 27 based on closing prices. The ruble
was 0.2 percent weaker at 39.8181 per euro and 0.2 percent
weaker at 28.11 per dollar.  The U.S., rated Aaa by Moody’s since 1917, was put on
review for the first time since 1996 on concern the country’s
debt threshold will not be raised in time to prevent a missed
payment of interest or principal on outstanding bonds even
though the risk is low, Moody’s said in a statement yesterday.  “The ruble might be vulnerable if the risk-off environment
continues,”  Gyula Toth , the Vienna-based chief of strategy for
Central and Eastern Europe at UniCredit SpA, wrote in an e-
mailed note today.  Russian  government bonds  rose for a second day, pushing the
yield on the ruble Eurobond due in 2018 down five basis points
to 6.869 percent. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a
guide to expectations of currency movements and allow companies
to hedge against them, show the ruble at 28.3597 per dollar in
three months, compared with 28.4635 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
