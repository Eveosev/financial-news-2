Germany  aims to balance its budget a
year earlier, pegging 2014 for reaching a cumulative zero in
spending and income, the  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported, citing
a government planning group.  Tax-revenue growth is helping the three levels of
government to speed up cutting their budget deficits, the
newspaper said, citing the group comprising federal and state
Finance Ministry officials. Germany in 2009 anchored a “debt
brake” in the constitution that compels the country to balance
its cumulative annual accounts by 2016. The goal was brought
forward a year in 2010 as the European debt crisis broke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
