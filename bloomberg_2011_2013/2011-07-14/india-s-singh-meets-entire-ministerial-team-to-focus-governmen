Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh 
will meet his entire team of ministers today for the first time
in two years, and is expected to urge unity and lay out his
agenda up to the 2014 general election.  The gathering will be followed by a regular cabinet meeting,
Harish Khare, the media adviser to Singh, said. The Hindustan
Times reported that the prime minister will lay out priorities
for the government’s welfare agenda for the country’s poor.
Khare said he wouldn’t “speculate” on Singh’s message.  Singh carried out his second cabinet reshuffle in six
months July 12 in a bid to refocus a government damaged by a
series of corruption allegations, rising prices and slowing
growth. His most senior ministers of finance, home affairs,
defense and foreign relations kept their jobs.  The most serious corruption charge against his government
revolves around irregularities in the 2008 sale of licenses to
run mobile-phone services. Two ministers have been forced to
resign over the scandal, one of whom is in jail along with a
federal lawmaker and company executives as their trial continues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
