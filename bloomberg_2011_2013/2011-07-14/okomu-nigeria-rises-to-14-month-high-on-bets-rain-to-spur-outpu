Okomu Oil Palm Plc (OKOMUOIL) , a Nigerian
processor of the kernels, rose to a 14-month high on
expectations that improved rainfall in the West African nation
will boost output.  The stock gained 40 kobo, or 2.5 percent, to 16.50 naira by
the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the strongest since May 2010.  “Palm fruits get bigger during the rainy season and
investors hope Okomu is taking advantage of this weather to
extract as much oil as possible from the fruits,” Bunmi Njugo,
a Lagos-based analyst with Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, said by phone.  Nigeria  will experience increased rainfall this year, the
meteorologic department has warned. Rainfall on July 10 led to
flooding in Lagos, Nigeria’s coastal commercial capital.  Okomu, which has been producing  palm oil  for 35 years in
Okomu-Udo in Edo state, midwestern  Nigeria , has been adding an
average of 5,000 hectares of the trees a year, and still has
room for expansion, chairman Gbenga Oyebode said on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
