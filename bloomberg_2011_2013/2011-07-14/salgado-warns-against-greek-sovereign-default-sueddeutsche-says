Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said a Greek sovereign debt default must be avoided and
the country needs more help from its euro-area partners,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  A default by the Greek government on its bonds would be bad
news, particularly for Greeks, and everything must be done to
prevent it, the Munich-based  newspaper  cited Salgado as saying
in todayâ€™s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
