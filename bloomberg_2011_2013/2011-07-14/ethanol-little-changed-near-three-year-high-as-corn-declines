Ethanol futures were little changed
near a three-year high in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline declined
on speculation the economy may slow and reduce demand.  The biofuel followed corn and gasoline lower after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank isn’t
prepared to take more action to stimulate the economy. Ethanol,
made from corn in the U.S., is blended with gasoline to stretch
supply and meet federal mandates.  “A little lower here,’ said Matt Janney, a trader at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.  “We had crude oil
under a lot of pressure today. Seemed like once Bernanke was
speaking and with everybody talking about the debt limit, things
fell. Ethanol held in a little bit, though.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 0.7 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $2.837 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices yesterday reached $2.844, the highest price since
July 3, 2008. Futures have gained 78 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slumped
4.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $2.85 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive lost 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.91, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  increased 4 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
$3.04 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive jumped 1.5
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.06.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $6.785 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for August delivery dropped 2.68 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.1248 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
20 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 26 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
