Empresa Nacional del Petroleo,
 Chile ’s state-owned oil refiner, appointed Ricardo Cruzat, an
executive at electricity generator and distributor Cia. General
de Electricidad, as chief executive officer.  Cruzat replaces Rodrigo Azocar, who was named to the post
by former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet in January 2009
after the state-owned company lost more than $958 million on
oil-futures trading the previous year. Cruzat, 49, who ran CGE’s
transmission business from 2008 until now, will take over on
July 31, Enap said in a statement today.  Billionaire President Sebastian Pinera has appointed other
private-sector executives to run Chile’s state-owned companies.
He named former BHP Billiton Ltd. executive  Diego Hernandez  to
run Codelco, the world’s largest copper producer, last year.
 Laurence Golborne , Chile’s mining and energy minister, is a
former CEO of Cencosud SA, Chile’s biggest retailer by sales.  The government is working on a plan to diversify Enap’s
business, Golborne told reporters last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
