OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil company controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , is
posting the biggest rally in the Brazilian  bond market  a month
after it was forced to pay more than it sought in a debut sale.  The yield on the company’s $2.56 billion of notes due in
2019 tumbled 61 basis points since the securities were issued on
May 26, the most among Brazilian company dollar debt excluding
bank bonds, to 7.89 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The average yield on bonds sold by global energy
companies including  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, over the same period to
4.02 percent, according to Bank of America Corp.  OGX is preparing to install production equipment at the
Campos Basin, where it’s had a 100 percent success rate drilling
for oil. The move is easing concern it may fail to deliver on
its plans to start producing oil after two delays. Batista
created OGX in 2007 and took it public one year later, making it
the first of three Brazilian start-ups to raise financing in
initial public offerings for exploration in a country that has
nearly doubled oil production over the past decade.  “The more uncertainties you take away, the better the bond
should trade, and they’re kind of working their way through
that,” George Strickland, who helps oversee $10 billion of
fixed-income assets as a managing director at Thornburg
Investment Management, said in a telephone interview from  Santa
Fe ,  New Mexico .  Production Plans  The company, which boosted the yield by as much as 100
basis points to 8.5 percent on its bond sale to drum up demand
in May, is accelerating drilling in the country’s  Santos Basin 
and said it will likely declare its Waikiki field commercial
sooner than expected after a test well confirmed potential
output of 40,000 barrels a day of crude. It plans to pump oil
for the first time in October from a region that supplied 84
percent of Brazil’s output in May.  OGX’s notes yield 435 basis points more than Brazilian
 government bonds  due in 2019, down from 485 on June 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on similar-
maturity bonds sold by Conoco, the third-largest U.S.  oil
company , fell 18 basis points since May 26 to 3.4 percent.
Dollar notes issued by Cnooc,  China ’s biggest offshore oil
producer by market value, yield 4.25 percent, down 20 basis
points during the same period.  OGX, based in Rio de Janeiro, plans to produce 730,000
barrels a day in 2015 and 1.38 million barrels a day in 2019,
according to the company’s website.  ‘Landmark Event’  “We see the beginning of production as a landmark event
for the company, which will continue to demonstrate our ability
to deliver the business plan and consequently positively impact
market perception,” OGX said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “The investment case has been well received by bond
holders, which coupled with the strong demand at the offer led
to a positive performance.”  OGX on May 9 delayed a plan to start producing oil at a
test well to October from August. The company, which reported a
lower-than-forecast increase in oil and gas resources in April,
has a total of 10.8 billion barrels of potential reserves,
according to a study released in April. It will invest $5.1
billion in the next three years to develop crude and natural-gas
discoveries.  “The information they are getting confirms or is even
better than what was originally anticipated,” Ana Paula Ares,
an analyst at  Fitch Ratings , said in a telephone interview from
 Buenos Aires . “What they have announced suggest their ramp-up
in production could be faster than we originally anticipated.”  OGX Rating  Ares said she doesn’t expect any delays to OGX’s plan to
begin producing oil at its OGX-26 well in October.  Fitch rates OGX B+, four levels below investment grade and
five steps below  Brazil .  OGX, which has about 90 percent of its exploration areas in
shallow waters, can have the same productivity in these wells as
in the deep waters of the so called pre-salt areas, Batista said
during an interview at Bloomberg News headquarters in New York
on March 14.  “It’s a bonanza, these are bonanza assets,” Batista said.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Brazilian dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries widened three basis points
yesterday to 176, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The cost of protecting Brazilian bonds against default for
five years was unchanged at 116 basis points, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
government or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  ‘No Track Record’  The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.5755 per  U.S. dollar .  The yield on interest-rate futures contracts due in January
2012 was unchanged at 12.48 percent.  OGX’s bonds are outperforming because the securities were
priced “too cheaply” at issue, not because investors are
growing more confident the company will begin to produce oil,
said Bevan Rosenbloom, a credit strategist at Citigroup Inc. in
 New York .  “It’s hard to do a bond deal for a junior exploration and
production company that has no track record or income statement
to speak of,” Rosenbloom said in a telephone interview.  Batista, the world’s eighth-wealthiest man according to
Forbes magazine, turned to debt markets after selling about $7.3
billion of shares in the past five years to finance investment
in energy, mining and transportation. He has sold shares in
offerings for five units since 2006.  Shares Slump  OGX has tumbled 29 percent this year in Sao Paulo trading
while MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the iron-ore miner
controlled by Batista, has lost 23 percent. Brazil’s Bovespa
index fell 12 percent during the same period.  OGX’s bonds will keep rallying if the company’s production
schedule remains on track, Thornburg’s Strickland said.  “Both the equity and bond investors are watching how this
plays out and how it unfolds,” Strickland said. “I haven’t
seen anything game-changing, but there’s been incremental news
that’s led to outperformance of the bonds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
