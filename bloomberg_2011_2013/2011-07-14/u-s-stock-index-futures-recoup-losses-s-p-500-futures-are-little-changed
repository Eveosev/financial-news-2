U.S. stock-index futures recoup
losses. Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in September slid less than 0.1 percent to 1,311.80 as
of 7:28 a.m. in  London .  Equity-index futures earlier fell after Moody’s Investors
Service said the American government may lose the Aaa credit
rating it’s held since 1917.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
