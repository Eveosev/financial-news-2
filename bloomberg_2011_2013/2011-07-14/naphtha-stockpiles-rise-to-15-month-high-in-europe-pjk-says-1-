Naphtha stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, advanced to the most in more than a year, according to PJK
International BV.  Naphtha, used in gasoline and petrochemicals, increased 22
percent to 112,000 metric tons in the week to today, following
imports from  Russia , according to PJK, a researcher based in the
Netherlands. That matches inventories held in mid-April 2010.  “Demand from the petrochemical industry is not very
exciting,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said by phone from
Oosterhout. Demand is “slightly less than usual” for this time
of year, he said.  Gasoline supplies gained 6.4 percent to 744,000 tons amid
imports from  France , Russia and the U.K., PJK data show. Cargoes
were shipped to  Mexico , the  United Arab Emirates , the U.S. and
 Africa .  Gasoil inventories declined 0.8 percent to 2.62 million
tons as cargoes were sent to West Africa,  Morocco  and the Suez
region, PJK data shows. Shipments of the fuel, which includes
heating oil and diesel, arrived from Russia and the U.S.  Jet fuel decreased 11 percent to 415,000 tons even as
supplies were delivered from the  Middle East , the data shows.  Fuel oil  advanced 1.4 percent to 742,000 tons as cargoes
arrived from Brazil, Finland, France, Russia and the U.K.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha, fuel oil and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
