Blockbuster LLC, bought out of
bankruptcy by  Dish Network Corp. (DISH) , is trying to poach customers
unhappy with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) ’s decision to separate its pricing
plans into more expensive tiers.  Netflix customers who switch to Blockbuster by Sept. 15
will receive a 30-day free trial, and pay $9.99 a month after
that for one DVD at a time, or $14.99 for two,  Michael Kelly ,
president of Blockbuster, said in an e-mailed statement.  Steve Swasey , a Netflix spokesman, said consumers would pay
more for the same service under Blockbuster’s offer.  “Why would someone do that when Netflix provides a free
30-day trial to new customers, and one DVD out at a time for
$7.99 a month?” Swasey said. “Competition is to be expected,
but there’s still no greater convenience, selection and value
than Netflix.”  Netflix, citing the costs to acquire and deliver films and
TV shows, said July 12 that it was shedding it $9.99-a-month
package of DVD-by-mail and unlimited streaming for U.S.
customers. Starting Sept. 1, the services would be split into
two, costing $7.99 each or $15.98 for both.  Blockbuster, which doesn’t offer a streaming service, said
its package adds more value because customers don’t have to wait
28 days to see some new releases as they do with Netflix under
its deals with several Hollywood studios.  Blockbuster also offers unlimited in-store exchanges,
videogame rentals and no additional charges for Blu-ray rentals,
the company said.  Netflix fell $12.11, or 4.1 percent, to $286.62 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
climbed 63 percent this year.  Dish, based in Englewood,  Colorado , fell 66 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $30.95. The shares have risen 57 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
