TMX Group Inc. (X) , the Toronto Stock
Exchange owner mulling a takeover bid by a group of Canadian
banks and pension funds, had 64.8 percent of the Canadian market
for stock trading in June, up from 64.5 percent in May.  Alpha Group, whose owners include Canada’s six largest
banks, had 19.4 percent of the market by number of shares, down
from 21.5 percent in May, according to monthly  statistics  from
the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada.  TMX’s market share has fallen from June 2010, when the
Toronto Stock Exchange and  TSX Venture Exchange  had 72.2 percent
of the market. Alpha had 18.6 percent of the market in the same
period. TMX, which had 99 percent of stock trading at the start
of 2007, has seen its share decline with the emergence of
alternative trading systems including Alpha, Pure Trading and
Instinet’s Chi-X platforms in Canada.  Maple Group Acquisition Corp., whose 13 members include
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  and Caisse de
Depot et Placement du Quebec, seeks to buy TMX Group in a C$3.73
billion ($3.89 billion) cash-and-stock offer worth C$50 a share.  Maple Group aims to integrate Alpha and Canadian clearing
house CDS Inc. into TMX after completing its takeover of the
exchange owner. TMX and  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  last
month ended a friendly combination after failing to get enough
shareholder support, leaving Maple Group as the lone suitor.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
