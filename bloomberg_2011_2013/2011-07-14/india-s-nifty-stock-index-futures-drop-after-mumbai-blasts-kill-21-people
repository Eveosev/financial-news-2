Most Indian stocks climbed after the
growth in monthly consumer prices lagged behind forecast.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s biggest lender, paced
gains among its peers. Inflation quickened to 9.44 percent in
June from 9.06 percent in May, the government said. The rate is
less than the 9.68 percent median estimate of 28 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest
motorcycle maker, retreated 1.5 percent after its first-quarter
profit increased less than estimates.  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software services exporter, declined ahead of
its quarterly earnings report later today.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
22.18, or 0.1 percent, to 18,618.20 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. Three shares climbed for every two that dropped on the
gauge. The gauge earlier rose as much as 1.1 percent. The S&P
CNX Nifty Index gained 0.3 percent to 5,599.80 and its July
futures settled at 5,585.10.  “People were expecting inflation to climb but it came
slightly below estimates,” said Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based
 fund manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which holds $1.1 billion
in stocks and bonds. “It was a consolation.”  The Sensex is the second-worst performer this year among
major indexes in the world’s 10 biggest markets as the  Reserve
Bank  of  India  raised borrowing rates to cool inflation. Stocks
on the measure are valued at 15.1 times estimated earnings,
compared with 10.9 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  The central bank has raised its repurchase rate 10 times
since the start of last year and the next policy review is on
July 26. Inflation has been above 8 percent since January 2010.  Fuel Costs  Inflation accelerated in June because of an increase in
diesel costs and higher prices of minerals and manufactured
products, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a statement
today. The government is working with the central bank to take
“appropriate” steps to cool prices.  Interest rates  are “peaking out” and the central bank has
been “fairly” successful in moderating growth, Morgan
Stanley’s India Managing Director Ridham Desai said in an
interview to Bloomberg UTV today. The brokerage is “more
positive” on emerging markets for the second-half of 2011.  State Bank  increased 1.5 percent to 2,467.1 rupees, its
steepest gain since July 7.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  rose 1.4 percent to
1,069.051 rupees.  Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest
mortgage lender, rose 1.4 percent to 703.6 rupees.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, surged 3 percent to 233.9
rupees, paring this year’s loss to 20 percent.  Unitech Ltd. (UT) , the
second-biggest, jumped 4.6 percent to 33.95 rupees.  Autos Rally  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the top truckmaker, added 2.1 percent to
1,068.1 rupees, the highest since June 1.  Mahindra & Mahindra
Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of sport-utility vehicles and tractors,
advanced 1.2 percent to 715.25 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the
largest engineering company, added 1 percent to 1,818.45 rupees
and its July futures settled at 1,812 rupees.  Bajaj Auto decreased 1.5 percent to 1,430.7 rupees. Net
income in the quarter ended June 30 increased to 7.11 billion
rupees ($160 million) from 5.9 billion rupees a year earlier.
That compares with the 7.4 billion rupee median of 18 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “Higher raw material costs impacted profitability,” said
Umesh Karne, a Mumbai-based analyst with Brics Securities Ltd.
who has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. “Bajaj Auto’s sales will
continue as demand remains strong, both in the export markets as
well as the domestic market.”  Infosys Ltd., the second-largest software maker, slid 1.3
percent to 2,740.35 rupees, extending its five-day loss to 8.5
percent. The company July 12 projected sales in the year ending
March to range from $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, less than the
$7.5 billion average of 56 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  TCS Earnings  Tata Consultancy plunged 2.2 percent to 1,123.7 rupees and
its July futures settled at 1,123.40 rupees. Profit may climb
23 percent to 22.6 billion rupees, according to the median
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Overseas funds sold a net 9.17 billion rupees ($205.3
million) of Indian stocks on June 12, paring their investment in
equities this year to 86.6 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .
