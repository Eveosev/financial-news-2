Joy Global Inc. (JOYG) , the maker of P&H
and Joy mining equipment, agreed to acquire China’s
 International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. (1683)  to add devices used
in underground coal extraction.  Joy will pay about HK$4.54 billion ($583.6 million) for 
private-equity firm Jordan Co.'s 41 percent of International 
Mining, Milwaukee-based Joy said today in a statement. The 
HK$8.50 a share Joy is paying is 30 percent more than 
International Mining’s July 11 closing price in Hong Kong. The 
shares have been suspended since then.  Following Chinese antitrust approval of the sale, Joy will
be required under the Hong Kong Takeovers Code to make an offer
for the rest of the company.  International Mining makes shearers, which cut coal from
the coal face, and underground excavating and tunneling
machines.  China  is the largest coal producer. Thermal coal at
the Australian port of Newcastle, the benchmark price for Asia,
has climbed 26 percent to $121.45 a metric ton in the past year,
according to McCloskey data.  The acquisition may be Joy’s biggest, topping its $1.1
billion purchase of LeTourneau Technologies Inc. from Rowan Cos.
in June, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The takeover of
LeTourneau added drilling rigs with retractable legs to a
portfolio that includes excavators, shovels and mining equipment
such as conveyors and roof supports.  Joy rose $3.49, or 3.7 percent, to $98.36 as of 9:58 a.m.
New York in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. International Mining,
which closed at HK$6.55 on July 11 in  Hong Kong , has advanced 87
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
