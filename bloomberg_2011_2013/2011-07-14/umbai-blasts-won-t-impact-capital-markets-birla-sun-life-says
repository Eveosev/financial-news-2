A. Balasubramanian, chief executive
officer of Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co.,  India ’s fifth
biggest money manager with $15.2 billion in assets, comments on
the outlook for Indian stocks. He spoke by phone today.  Three bomb blasts hit Mumbai, India’s financial capital,
last night, killing at least 17 people. The Bombay Stock
Exchange Sensitive Index lost 0.2 percent to 18,567.53 as of
11:42 a.m. local time. The benchmark gauge has retreated 9.6
percent this year.  The blasts “should not have an impact from the capital
markets point of view.”  “While it is an unfortunate event, investors would
ultimately start looking at certainty and how it’s being tackled
and to what extent it could have an impact on overall economic
growth momentum.”  “Investors will start looking at how the government is
going to take forward the reform process and some of the policy
initiatives that have been discussed in the past.”  “Global cues could definitely be one of the drivers” for
the stock markets.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
