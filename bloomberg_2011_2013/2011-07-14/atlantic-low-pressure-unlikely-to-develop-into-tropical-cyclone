Low pressure in the Atlantic and
Caribbean basins has a “near zero” chance of becoming a
tropical cyclone, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.  The system, along the coast of  Mexico  near Tuxpan, is
“moving northwestward and is expected to move into eastern
Mexico without significant development,” the Miami-based center
said today in an  advisory  posted on its website at 2 a.m. New
York time.  Cloudiness and showers will continue to affect parts of
eastern Mexico as the low pressure continues to move inland, the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
