U.S. stocks erased gains after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank
is not prepared “at this point” to take action to stimulate
the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,317.94 at 11 a.m. in  New York  after rising as much as 0.7
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 19.68
points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,511.29 after surging 90 points
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
