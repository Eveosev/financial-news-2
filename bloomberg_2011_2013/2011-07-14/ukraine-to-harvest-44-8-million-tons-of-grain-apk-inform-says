Ukraine is to harvest 44.8 million
metric tons of grain this year, according to estimates by
agriculture researcher APK-Inform.  The corn harvest may be up to 15 million tons with average
yields increasing to 4.7 tons a hectare (2.5 acres), said
Anastasia Ivasenko, a grain analyst with the Dnipropetrovsk-
based researcher, at a forum in the capital Kiev today. August’s
weather will be critical for the crop, she said.  Wheat production will probably be 19.3 million tons,
Ivasenko said. APK decreased its barley forecast to 8.4 million
tons from 8.6 million tons, she said.  Grain exports for the marketing year which started July 1
may reach 18.4 million tons, according to Ivasenko.  Milling wheat will probably make up 30 percent of the all
wheat output, as rain reduced the crop’s quality, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
