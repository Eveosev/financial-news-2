Metorex Ltd. (MTX) , the African copper
producer subject to a $1.36 billion takeover bid, said it’s
recommended the offer from  China ’s Jinchuan Group Co. and agreed
not to seek further approaches.  The board of Metorex will recommend shareholders vote in
favor of the Jinchuan offer of 8.90 rand ($1.30) a share, the
Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement.  Vale SA (VALE3) 
this week abandoned an earlier agreed bid of 7.35 rand a share.  Metorex will pay a break-fee to Vale of 75.2 million rand
($11 million), it said. Jinchuan agreed to pay a break-fee of as
much 182 million rand should its bid fail for a number of
reasons, including not winning Chinese government approvals.  The battle for Metorex’s copper and cobalt mines in  Zambia 
and the Democratic Republic of Congo pitted Brazil’s Vale
against China’s biggest nickel producer as companies from the
largest natural-resource consumers scour Africa for mines.  The purchase of Metorex would give Jinchuan control of the
Ruashi open-pit mine in Congo and the Chibuluma copper project
in Zambia.  Metorex declined 0.4 percent to 8.42 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
