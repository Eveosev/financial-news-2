Nexen Inc. (NXY) , a Canadian oil and gas
producer, said it will conduct maintenance next month on its oil
sands upgrader at Long Lake,  Alberta .  “The third HLS unit and second cogeneration unit are
scheduled to undergo maintenance in August,” the Calgary-based
company said in a statement accompanying its second-quarter
earnings today.  An HLS unit is a hot lime softener used in turning the
tarry bitumen sands into crude oil.  Turnarounds are planned at several of the company’s
operations in the third quarter, including Long Lake, Kevin Reinhart, Nexen’s chief financial officer, said on a conference
call.  Calls to three company spokesmen weren’t immediately
returned.  Nexen expects bitumen output from Long Lake to increase to
the mid-30,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, from about
30,000 barrels a day at the end of June, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
