(Corrects date of last Moody’s review in fourth
paragraph.)  U.K. stocks declined after Moody’s
Investors Service said the U.S. may lose the top Aaa credit
rating it’s held since 1917 and Italian  government bonds  fell as
borrowing costs rose at a debt auction.  Intercontinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  decreased 2.1 percent
after U.S. rival Marriott International Inc. forecast earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  dropped 2.9
percent after Barclays Plc downgraded the shares.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) ,
the world’s largest primary silver producer, gained 2.2 percent
after reporting record second-quarter volumes.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  decreased 0.6 percent to 5,871.97 at
1:53 p.m. in  London , the fourth decline in five days. The
benchmark measure has dropped 3.6 percent from this year’s high
on Feb. 8 amid concern the European fiscal crisis is spreading.
The FTSE All-Share Index also lost 0.6 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 0.4 percent.  Moody’s put the U.S. debt rating on review for the first
time since 1996 as talks to raise the country’s $14.3 trillion
debt limit stalled, adding to concern that political gridlock
will lead to default. Even a temporary default will probably
have “large systemic effects” on the economy and Treasury
finances by disrupting money funds, the repurchase-agreement
market and foreign investors’ willingness to buy the
government’s debt, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  ‘Add Uncertainty’  “We believe U.S. politicians will arrive at a solution,
but the longer they wait, the more they add uncertainty to
financial markets,” said Michael Borre, chief equity adviser at
Nordea Private Banking in Copenhagen. “That’s just the thing
nobody needs now before the European bank stress tests being
published tomorrow and the Italian vote on budget cuts.”  Italy sold just under 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion) of
four different bonds with maturities ranging from five to 15
years today. The Treasury priced 1.25 billion euros of five-year
bonds to yield 4.93 percent, the highest since June 2008. That’s
up from 3.9 percent at the previous auction on June 14.  The Italian Senate is voting today on budget cuts to tame
the second-largest debt burden in  Europe , which prompted
investors to drive borrowing costs to a 14-year high of 6.02
percent on July 12. European regulators are seeking to assuage
investor concern that banks in the region are inadequately
capitalized with a second round of stress tests to be published
tomorrow.  ‘Shock and Awe’  “It’s reasonable to expect the market mood to improve once
we’ve passed the Italian vote on austerity measures, but as
we’ve seen over the past two weeks it almost doesn’t matter what
happens to politics,” said Graham Bishop, European equity
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “Markets are
almost at that point where they need convincing a shock-and-awe
response is being seriously considered.”  Greece ’s credit rating was cut three levels to Fitch
Ratings’ lowest grade for any country in the world as the
company followed rivals and said that a default is a “real
possibility.”  Intercontinental Hotels retreated 2.1 percent to 1,255
pence after Marriott forecast third-quarter earnings of 25 to 29
cents per share. That fell short of analysts’ estimates for
earnings per share of 30 cents.  Petrofac dropped 2.9 percent to 1,459 pence after Barclays
downgraded the oil and gas engineer to “underweight” from
“equal weight.”  Fresnillo Gains  Fresnillo rose 2.2 percent to 1,554 pence after saying
silver output rose 7.2 percent to a record after it started
production at its Saucito mine in  Mexico . The precious metal has
surged more than 10 percent over the past three days.  Goldminer Rangold Resources Ltd. rose 1.4 percent to 5,515
pence, while  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining
company, slipped 1.2 percent to 2,411 pence.  Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO)  slumped 4.8 percent to 418.3
pence, the lowest since January 2010. The publisher of the  Daily
Mail  said advertising sales declined 7 percent in the 13 weeks
through July 3.  Mothercare Plc decreased 1.8 percent to 403.3 pence, a
sixth day of losses, as the retailer said U.K. sales fell 1.8
percent for the 15 weeks to July 9.  Associated British Foods Plc (ABF)  jumped 2.9 percent to 1,088
pence after reporting increased revenue. Sales at its Primark
clothing stores advanced 15 percent in the 16 weeks ended June
25, faster than the 11 percent growth in the preceding six
months.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  gained 2.8 percent to 45.64 pence
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its rating on the U.K.’s
largest mortgage lender to “buy” from “neutral,” saying  it
expects the company to deliver high returns and payout ratios.  To contact the reporter on this story:
