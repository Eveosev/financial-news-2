Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank is monitoring fiscal difficulties
of U.S. states, including California and Illinois, as a
potential risk to the economy.  “We watch those very carefully,” Bernanke said to the
Senate Banking Committee today in  Washington . “We don’t see any
immediate risk there. We don’t think it is analogous to the
European situation.”  California and Illinois have had “more difficulty” than
some other states, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
