CapitaLand Ltd. (CAPL)  and Mitsubishi
Estate Co. said they will tie up in a S$1.4 billion ($1.15
billion) venture to redevelop a downtown  Singapore  parking lot
structure into a 40-story office building.  CapitaLand,  Southeast Asia ’s biggest developer, its
property trust CapitaCommercial Trust, and Mitsubishi Estate,
 Japan ’s second-largest developer, will turn the Market Street
Car Park into an 887,000-square-foot office tower, they said.
CapitaLand will hold a 50 percent stake, the trust will own 40
percent and Mitsubishi Estate will have 10 percent, they said.  The 245-meter (804-foot) building will match the height of
new office towers including One Raffles Quay and Marina Bay
Financial Centre, according to the  website  of Council on Tall
Buildings and Urban Habitat. The new property is expected to
generate a 6 percent annual return when it’s completed by the
end of 2014, they said in a statement to the Singapore exchange.  “Investing in the Market Street office development is
aligned with our strategy to strengthen our pipeline of
commercial properties in Singapore and to lend support to our
sponsored commercial REIT,  CapitaCommercial Trust (CCT) ,” said Chong Lit Cheong, chief executive officer of CapitaLand’s commercial
property unit.  Exceeding Limits  The parking lot is now owned by CapitaCommercial and will
be sold to the joint venture for S$56 million, 15 percent higher
than its valuation in December, according to the statement.
CapitaCommercial needed the partners because the project
exceeded 10 percent of its total asset size, a limit set by
Singapore for new developments by real estate investment trusts.  The building would be among five properties in Singapore
with that height, according to Council on Tall Buildings. The
three tallest in the city stand at 280 meters, CapitaLand’s
headquarters Capital Tower is 254 meters in height, followed by
the Altez apartment block at 250 meters.  CapitaLand dropped 0.3 percent to S$2.94 at 9:25 a.m. in
Singapore, and CapitaCommercial lost 0.3 percent at S$1.46.
Mitsubishi Estate fell 0.2 percent to 1,454 yen in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
