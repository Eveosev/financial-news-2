Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell as crude oil dropped after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said he’s not prepared to take immediate action
to stimulate the world’s biggest economy.  American depositary receipts of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s
largest commodities trader, dropped 0.4 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Nissan Motor Co., a Japanese
automaker that gets one third of its revenue in  North America ,
gained 0.6 percent after the yen’s appreciation eased. ADRs of
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company and
Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, retreated 1.3 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,920 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
9,930 in Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 9,940
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slid 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
gained 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “There will be a tug of war between a decline in crude
prices dragging natural resource-related companies lower and the
yen supporting exporters,” said Juichi Wako, a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “It’s difficult
for investors to be aggressive ahead of stress tests of European
banks.”  The European Banking Authority will release, after the
close of European equity markets today, the results of the
stress tests for 91 banks as part of an effort to reassure
investors the region’s lenders have sufficient capital.  Bernanke Testifies  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index slipped 0.7 percent to
1,308.87 yesterday, the lowest level this month, as a stalemate
continued in  Washington  on negotiations over the U.S. debt
ceiling.  Bernanke, testifying for a second day before the Senate
Banking Committee, told lawmakers yesterday: “We’re not
prepared at this point to take further action.” A day earlier,
he had said he was prepared to provide more stimulus if needed.  Bernanke said yesterday that inflation now is “higher”
and “closer” to the central bank’s informal target than was
the case in August and that’s one reason the Fed won’t
immediately embark on a third round of bond-buying.  U.S. equities had gained earlier in the day as government
reports showed retail sales unexpectedly increased and jobless
claims fell more than economists estimated.  Oil Falls  The 0.1 percent increase in retail sales reported by the
Commerce Department compared with the median forecast of a 0.1
percent drop in the Bloomberg News survey of 80 economists.
Excluding auto sales, purchases were little changed, the weakest
performance since July 2010. Separate data showed initial
jobless claims fell by 22,000 to 405,000 last week.  Crude oil for August delivery dropped 2.4 percent to settle
at $95.69 a barrel in New York yesterday. Oil has risen 23
percent in the past year.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum fell 1.8 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.5 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 4.1 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen depreciated to 79.27 against the dollar, compared
with 78.98 at the close of  stock trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday. A
weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
