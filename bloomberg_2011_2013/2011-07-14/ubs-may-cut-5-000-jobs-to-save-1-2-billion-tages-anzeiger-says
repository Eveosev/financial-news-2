UBS AG (UBSN)  may cut 5,000 jobs to help
save 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion) a year,  Tages-
Anzeiger  reported today, citing unidentified “insiders.”  Staff account for about two-thirds of operating costs at
UBS, the newspaper reported, even after the company removed
10,000 positions since the financial crisis. Employees earn 30
percent more than two years ago and the headcount in  Asia  rose
to 7,600 by the end of March, a gain of 10 percent from a year
earlier, the report said.  The slump in stock markets,  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
concerns and high costs from the strong Swiss currency have hurt
profitability, Tages-Anzeiger reported. New tax treaties with
the U.K., Germany and the U.S. will also affect margins, the
newspaper said.  Andreas Kern, a spokesman for UBS, declined to comment on
the report today, calling it “speculation.” UBS will publish
information on costs and efficiency measures on July 26,
according to Tages-Anzeiger.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is planning to slash costs by 5
percent, and cut almost 1,000 jobs,  Handelszeitung  reported,
citing an unidentified person familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
