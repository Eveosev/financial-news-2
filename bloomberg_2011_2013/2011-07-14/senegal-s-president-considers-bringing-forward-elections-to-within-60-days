Senegal president Abdoulaye Wade
said he could organise elections within 60 days, in his first
speech since riots erupted in the capital Dakar over prolonged
electricity cuts. Presidential elections are currently planned
for February 2012.  “If the opposition is in a hurry, and if they agree, I can
organise an early election in 40 to 60 days,” President Wade
said at a meeting of elected government officials on Thursday.  “If the Senegalese people decide to give the power to
another leader, I will congratulate the winner,” Wade added.  Violent protests broke out across the capital on June 23
over proposed plans to change the constitution to allow the
President to nominate a Vice President before elections and to
reduce the winning threshold in elections to 25 percent. On June
28 protestors set fire to government buildings and offices of
the national electricity company Senelec after powercuts that
lasted up to 20 hours at a time.  Wade plans to stand for a third term which the opposition
says is illegal because the constitution allows only one re-
election.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
