Georgia Tech  forfeited the 2009
Atlantic Coast Conference football championship, was fined
$100,000 and placed on probation by the  National Collegiate
Athletic Association  for failing to cooperate with an
investigation of eligibility violations.  The probe involved Georgia Tech’s football and basketball
programs.  The football infractions involve a former Yellow Jackets
player receiving $312 worth of clothing as a gift from an
employee of a sports agency in 2009, a violation of
preferential-treatment rules, the NCAA said in a statement
disclosing its  ruling .  The university then failed to cooperate with the
investigation, the NCAA said in a 26-page report. During the
probe, the university’s former compliance officer twice acted in
a “demonstratively untruthful” manner, creating a “disservice
to the institution,” the NCAA wrote in its report.  The Yellow Jackets forfeited their 39-34 win over Clemson
in the ACC championship game on Dec. 5, 2009, which occurred
after the school was told of the preferential treatment
violations by the former team member.  The basketball violations involve non-scholastic
tournaments conducted on the school’s Atlanta campus in May 2009
and May 2010, which involved university staff. The tournaments
violated NCAA rules involving impermissible tryouts.  As a result, the university forfeited two of its basketball
recruiting days during the 2011 summer evaluation period, a
penalty previously self-imposed by the school. The NCAA today
reduced to 10 the number official visits for basketball recruits
during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 academic years.  Probation Span  The probation period runs through July 13, 2015, the NCAA
said. None of the athletes involved were identified.  Georgia Tech came off of a two-year probation in November
2007. Under NCAA guidelines, the school was subject to added
penalties as a repeat violator if it committed another major
infraction over the following two years.  Six years ago, NCAA officials said the Atlanta school
allowed athletes in four sports, including 11 football players,
to participate even though many of the classes they were taking
didn’t count toward degrees.  The NCAA’s Committee on Infractions accepted sanctions the
school proposed in 2005, including the loss of six football
scholarships for both the 2005 and 2006 recruiting classes.  Members of the men’s and women’s track and field teams and
the women’s swimming team also were involved in the 2005
violations and lost scholarships.  To contact the reporter on this story:
