Gulf Coast  ultra-low-sulfur diesel
strengthened after Total SA shut a sulfur incinerator at its
Port Arthur refinery in Texas.  The 240,000-barrel-a-day plant shut the sulfur recovery
unit No. 5 incinerator yesterday “to repair environmental
monitoring thermowells,” according to a report to the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel in the Gulf
Coast rose 0.33 cent to 3.98 cents a gallon versus heating oil
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 11:21
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
gained 0.39 cent to $3.1401 a gallon.  Pat Avery, a spokeswoman for the Total plant, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking additional comment.  Exxon Mobil Corp. had a leak on a benzene recovery line at
the Chalmette refinery in  Louisiana , according to a filing to
the National Response Center. The incident happened at 7:15 a.m.
local time yesterday, the report said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast held steady at 13 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
