Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV) ’s earnings are likely to miss expectations next year and in
2013 because of rising programming costs and a “sluggish”
recovery of advertising sales, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  CME, as the company is known, was rated “underperform” in
new coverage by the Swiss bank, which set a 12-month price
estimate for its shares at $16.5, analysts Krzysztof Kaczmarczyk
in Warsaw and Zoltan Palfi in  London  wrote in a report today.  “We expect a sluggish advertising market recovery in 2011
and 2012 in CME’s territories” as advertisers wait for a pickup
in “consumption growth to unfreeze ad budgets,” the analysts
said. “We expect earnings to surprise on the downside in 2012
and 2013 due to increasing programming costs.”  The operator of channels in the  Czech Republic , Romania,
 Croatia , Slovakia, Slovenia and Bulgaria has been battling a
slower-than-expected pickup in advertising as the countries
recover from recession. The company’s net loss shrank to $21.1
million in the first quarter from $42.3 million a year earlier
as revenue rose 20 percent to $172.8 million, Bermuda-registered
CME said in April.  “Real gross-domestic-product growth would need to reach
about 4 percent to 5 percent in 2012 and 2013 in CME’s
territories -- versus our forecast of 2 percent to 4.4 percent -
- to see strong ad growth and margins improvement,” Kaczmarczyk
and Palfi wrote in the Credit Suisse report. Ad revenue and
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
are “unlikely to rebound to pre-crisis levels,” they said.  CME fell 1.9 percent to 323.20 koruna by 11:05 a.m. in
Prague. On the  Nasdaq  in  New York  its home market, the shares
rose 1 percent to $18.67 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
