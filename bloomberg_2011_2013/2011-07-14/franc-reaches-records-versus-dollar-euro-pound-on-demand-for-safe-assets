The Swiss franc touched records
against the dollar, euro and pound as investors sought the
safest assets as Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade
the U.S. credit rating.  Switzerland’s currency appreciated for the fifth straight
day against both the dollar and euro, and was also bolstered as
 Fitch Ratings  lowered Greece’s rating three notches to CCC.  “The fear of the U.S. downgrade has led to a swift move to
the safe haven currency,” said  Sebastien Galy , a foreign-
exchange analyst at Societe Generale in London. “ What is
moving the franc now is the dollar.”  The Swiss currency appreciated as much as 1.2 percent to a
record 80.83 centimes per dollar before trading 0.1 percent
stronger at 81.66 centimes as of 5:16 p.m. in London. It
strengthened as much as 0.8 percent to 1.14945 per euro and was
recently 0.2 percent stronger at 1.15619.  The franc has gained more than 16 percent in the last 12
months against nine developed-market peers measured by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
