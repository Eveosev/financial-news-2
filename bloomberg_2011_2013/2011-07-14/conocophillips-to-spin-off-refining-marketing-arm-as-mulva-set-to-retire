ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it would spin
off its refining and marketing arm into a new business, two
weeks after  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  split itself up to increase
returns for investors.  ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, will divide into two
stand-alone, publicly traded operations. The division is
expected to be completed in the first half of 2012, the company 
said in a statement today.  Marathon Petroleum Corp., Marathon’s former refining
business, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange this month.
Marathon rose as much as 11 percent on the day the split was
announced.  “I love it!”  said  Fadel Gheit , a New York-based analyst
for Oppenheimer & Co., who rates the shares “outperform” and
owns none. “It worked for Marathon and it will work even better
for ConocoPhillips. ConocoPhillips is a much better company.”  ConocoPhillips made the announcement before regular trading
opened on U.S. markets. ConocoPhillips rose $4.61, or 6.2
percent, to $79.01 in  New York  at 7:16 a.m. Before today, the
shares had risen 9.25 percent this year. The shares have 11
buys, 10 holds and three sell ratings from analysts.  ConocoPhillips is the second-largest U.S. oil refiner with
capacity of 2 million barrels per day, according to its website.
It owns 12 U.S. refineries, and has a two-refinery joint venture
with Alberta-based oil producer Cenovus Corp. The plants account
for about 10 percent of U.S. refining capacity, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Largest Independent Refiner  Following the split, ConocoPhillips’ refining arm will be
the largest U.S. independent refiner, with more capacity than
Valero Energy Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ConocoPhillips also owns five refineries outside the U.S.  “Their refining assets are certainly more geographically
diversified than Marathon’s,” said Ann Kohler, an analyst at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Marathon
benefits from its high integration in the Mid-Continent.”  The announcement comes as the crack spread, a measure of
the difference between the cost of crude oil and the price of
products derived from it, exceeded $35 a barrel, the widest in
at least 25 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  After the split is completed Chief Executive Officer  Jim Mulva  will retire, according to the statement.  ConocoPhillips was formed in 2002 from the $25 billion
merger of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc., which created
the third-largest U.S. oil company. Phillips’s Mulva became the
new company’s chief executive officer and continued to expand
ConocoPhillips with the 2006 purchase of Burlington Resources
Inc.  Prior to the ConocoPhillips merger, Phillips acquired
independent refiner Tosco Corp. in 2001, adding eight refineries
to its portfolio.  To contact the reporters on this story:
