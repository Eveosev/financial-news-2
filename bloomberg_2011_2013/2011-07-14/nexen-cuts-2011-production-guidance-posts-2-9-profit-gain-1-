Nexen Inc. (NXY) , a Canadian oil and gas
producer, lowered its production guidance for the year after
maintenance cut output from the U.K. North Sea Buzzard field.  Full-year volumes will average 210,000 to 230,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, down from a May forecast of at least
230,000 barrels, Calgary-based Nexen said today in a statement.
The company also said second-quarter profit climbed 2.9 percent
after  oil prices  rose.  Nexen expects maintenance at Buzzard to be completed in
August. The field is the biggest stream in the Forties blend,
one of the four North Sea crudes used to price more than half
the world’s oil. Nexen also plans work at the Scott and Ettrick
platforms in the  North Sea  in the third quarter, it said.  Quarterly production dropped to 204,000 barrels a day
from 248,000 barrels a day a year earlier, following 
disruptions at Buzzard and the Syncrude project as well as
“natural declines” at its Yemen operations, Nexen said.  “While we are disappointed with the downtime at Buzzard,
we are making steady progress in all areas of our business,”
Chief Executive Officer Marvin Romanow said in the statement.  Net income advanced to C$252 million ($263 million) in the
second quarter from C$245 million a year earlier, buoyed by
“strong” oil prices, Nexen said. Crude futures averaged
$102.34 a barrel in the period, compared with $78.05 a year
earlier.  In May, the company cut its full-year production target to
the “low end” of a range of 230,000 barrels to 270,000 barrels
a day.  Nexen fell 18 cents to C$21.17 in Toronto trading
yesterday. The stock, which has 7 “buy,” 5 “sell” and 11
“hold” ratings from analysts, is down 7.2 percent this year.
The earnings announcement was made before the start of regular
trading on North American markets.  -- With assistance from Sherry Su in  London . Editor: Stephen Cunningham  To contact the reporter on this story:
