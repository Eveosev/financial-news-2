Following are comments from Eugene Leng, chief executive officer of  Ukrzernoprom Agro LLC , on
prospects for Ukraine’s grain harvest.  Leng spoke at a forum in Kiev today. Ukrzernoprom Agro is a
unit of Vienna-based MCB Agricole Holding AG.  “The quality of wheat and barley will decline essentially
after rains. It will not be possible to harvest a lot of milling
wheat. There will be 10 percent to 17 percent wheat loss after
rains. Winter grain loss will partially be compensated with
spring grain and total grain harvest may be between 43 to 44
million tons.  “I am concerned with the possibility of dry weather in
August and in September during planting of winter grains.
Another problem is a possibility of snowless cold winter.  “Corn yields may gain as much as 20 percent in some areas.  “The present decline of commodity prices is a short-term
trend. The trend of commodities-price increases will not change
until 2020.  “Prices for milling wheat in Ukraine will exceed world
prices after weather damaged its quality. I recommend traders
not to rush export wheat, and I recommend producers not to rush
selling wheat.  “Barley prices in Ukraine will fundamentally increase,
albeit some possible declines during short periods of time.  “Good-quality rapeseed will be in short supply in Ukraine,
as it has suffered from rains. Its prices will grow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
