Denmark’s  Thomas Bjorn  holds a one-
stroke lead in the first round of the British Open as tournament
favorite  Rory McIlroy  struggled early.  Bjorn is 3-under par through 12 holes at Royal St.
George’s. The Dane, who tied for second the last time the Open
was played at the Sandwich, England, course got into the field
after Vijay Singh withdrew earlier this week.  U.S. Open champion McIlroy is 2-over par through six holes.
The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland made bogeys at the first
and third holes.  American Mark Calcavecchia, the 1989 champion, and Spain’s
Miguel Angel Jimenez are tied for second at 2-under, with Luke
Donald and 2009 winner Stewart Cink among seven golfers at 1-
under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
