Software AG,  Germany ’s second-
largest maker of  business software , fell the most in two years
in Frankfurt trading after reporting second-quarter sales that
missed analysts’ estimates.  Revenue will be 256 million euros ($364 million) to 258
million euros, hurt by currency moves and the unexpected failure
to close software-license deals, the Darmstadt-based company
said late yesterday. Demand for implementation of products from
 SAP AG (SAP) , the world’s largest maker of business-management
software, fell from last year, it said. Sales had been seen at
280 million euros, the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
eight analysts.  The stock fell as much as 6.74 euros, or 16 percent, to
35.32 euros, the biggest intraday drop since April 2009, and
traded 12 percent lower at 36.84 euros as of 10:32 a.m.  On July 12, Indian software exporter Infosys Ltd. forecast
sales that missed analysts’ estimates as customers held off
signing new contracts because of uncertainties in the global
economy.  Software AG, which makes software for business transactions
and offers consulting services, said it still forecasts growth
in full-year sales of as much as 7 percent at constant
currencies and net income to increase as much as 15 percent
based on a “strong” sales pipeline.  Software AG (SOW)  will report complete second quarter results on
July 28 and SAP will report earnings on July 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
