Lithuania  picked  Hitachi Ltd. (6501) 
together with Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd. over Westinghouse
Electric Corp. to build a new nuclear power plant in the country
as it seeks to cut its dependence on power imports.  The government aims to sign an agreement with Hitachi by
the end of the year and to complete construction by the end of
2020, Deputy Energy Minister Romas Svedas told a news conference
in Vilnius today. He declined to disclose the preliminary costs
of the investment.  Lithuania seeks to diversify its energy resources after it
closed its only and Soviet-era Ignalina nuclear facility at the
end of 2009 to comply with European Union rules, pushing up
energy costs and increasing dependence on Russian sources of
power.  “We picked the most economically attractive proposal,”
Svedas said.  Hitachi offered its ABWR reactor technology with a proposed
capacity of 1,300 megawatts in output at the projected plant in
Visaginas, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) northeast of the
capital.  The government has said in the past that the strategic
investor could be offered as much as a 51 percent stake in the
new plant. Any agreement would require parliament’s approval.
Lithuania, which is building the facility along with neighbors
Latvia, Estonia and  Poland , is continuing talks on the size of
each stake with all parties in the project, Svedas said.  The tender for a strategic investor to build a nuclear
plant failed last year after  Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP)  withdrew
its bid. Lithuania continued to look for an investor through
direct negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
