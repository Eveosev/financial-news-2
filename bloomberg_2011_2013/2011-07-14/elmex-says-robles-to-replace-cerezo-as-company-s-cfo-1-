Telefonos de Mexico SAB,   Mexico ’s
largest fixed-line phone and internet provider, said Carlos Robles Miaja will serve as the company’s chief financial officer
starting Aug. 15.  Robles Miaja, 39, currently works as deputy director of
budget and financial evaluation. He will replace Adolfo Cerezo Perez, 58, Telmex, as the Mexico City-based company is known,
said in a statement to the Mexican stock exchange today.  Cerezo Perez is retiring after working for Telmex for 33
years, according to the statement.  Telmex, controlled by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim , has
lost customers to rivals including  Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO)  and
Megacable Holdings Inc., which are offering bundled services of
telephone, internet and cable television.  Telmex, which controls 80 percent of Mexico’s fixed lines,
is not allowed to offer a video product by Mexico’s government,
which says the company must first comply with rules governing
phone-network connections.  Telmex shares rose 0.1 percent to 9.47 pesos in Mexico City
trading today. They’ve declined 5.4 percent this year, less than
the 6 percent decline for the benchmark IPC index of 37 Mexican
stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
