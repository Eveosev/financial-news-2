Spotify Ltd., the European online
music service, will begin accepting U.S. users tomorrow, after
more than a year of negotiations with  record companies .  The streaming service will be available by invitation and
through subscription, London-based Spotify said today in a
statement distributed by Marketwire.  Spotify’s service offers free, advertising-supported music
on computers, and will vie with Oakland, California-based
Pandora Media Inc. for listeners. Spotify subscribers receive
commercial-free content and can play songs on mobile devices.
Closely held Spotify said in March it has 1 million paying
customers, or 15 percent of its total. In the U.K., a monthly
Spotify subscription costs 9.99 pounds ($16.16).  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music Group, the largest record
company by market share, reached a deal with Spotify last month,
according to people with knowledge of the talks.  Sony Corp. (6758)  and
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s EMI Group Ltd. were already on board, leaving
Warner Music Group as the only one of the four major record
labels that hasn’t reached an agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
