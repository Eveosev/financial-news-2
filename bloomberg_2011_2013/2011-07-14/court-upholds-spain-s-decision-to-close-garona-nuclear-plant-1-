Spain’s National Court upheld the
government’s decision to close the Garona nuclear plant in 2013,
rejecting appeals calling either for its immediate closure or an
extension to its working life.  The ruling today responded to 11 appeals that included
calls from the plant’s owners,  Endesa SA (ELE)  and  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , to
allow the facility to operate until 2019. Environment groups
Greenpeace and Ecologistas en Accion had appealed for its
immediate closure, the court said in an e-mailed statement.  Nuclenor SA, the company that runs Garona, said in a
separate statement it is waiting for its lawyers to assess what
legal measures it can take to allow the plant to continue
operating.  Spain extended in 2009 the life of the country’s oldest
nuclear plant beyond 40 years, agreeing to shut it in 2013 in a
U-turn for the ruling Socialist party, which had made election
promises to phase out nuclear power. The government pledged a
safety review of its six nuclear plants in March following
 Japan ’s atomic disaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
