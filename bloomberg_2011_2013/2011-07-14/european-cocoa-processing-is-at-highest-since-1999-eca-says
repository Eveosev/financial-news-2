European cocoa usage rose to the
highest level since at least 1999, when the European Cocoa
Association began compiling figures for the so-called grind, a
demand indicator.  Bean processing climbed 8.3 percent to 355,593 metric tons
in the second quarter from 328,426 tons a year earlier, the
Brussels-based industry group said today in a report. The
increase was the largest since the year-earlier 13 percent
advance, according to the figures.  Cocoa climbed 6.7 percent in New York trading in the second
quarter and 3.6 percent in  London .  The association gathered its figures from 24 companies
including Nestle SA, which this month started selling its KitKat
chocolate bars in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
