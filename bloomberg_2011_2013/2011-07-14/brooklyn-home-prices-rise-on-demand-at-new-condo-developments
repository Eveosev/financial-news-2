Home prices  in Brooklyn, New York’s
most populous borough, climbed in the second quarter, led by
demand for condominiums in new developments as affluent buyers
entered the market.  The median price of newly built condos that sold in the
period was $535,000, a 9.9 percent jump from a year earlier, New
York appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas
Elliman Real Estate  said today in a joint report. The median
price of all Brooklyn condos, co-ops and one- to three-family
houses increased 3.7 percent to $480,000.  “We’ve recaptured almost half of the values from the
credit crunch, but it doesn’t mean the market is rising,”
 Jonathan Miller , president and chief executive officer of Miller
Samuel, said in a telephone interview. “I’m not characterizing
this as a recovery, but stability.”  Almost three years after the real estate crash tightened
credit and sent property values tumbling, deals at new
developments in  Brooklyn  are increasing. New condos, which
generally attract wealthier buyers, made up almost a quarter of
all Brooklyn home sales in the three months through June, up
from 14 percent last year and the largest share since Miller’s
company began tracking the data in 2008, he said.  “There’s been a more affluent shift in the market,”
Miller said. “We’re going on three years since the credit
crunch, so maybe it’s a sign, at least in the upper end, of more
confidence.”  New-condo sales totaled 478 for the second quarter, a 76
percent increase from a year earlier, according to Miller Samuel
and Prudential.  Tax Credit  Rising demand for new condos helped keep Brooklyn
transactions stable for the second quarter, Miller said. Sales
of all properties totaled 1,942, little changed from a year
earlier, when buyers under contract rushed to complete deals
before an initial June 30 expiration of a federal tax credit of
as much as $8,000. Sales declined 18 percent from the previous
three months,  Miller Samuel  and Prudential said.  The median price for all condos was $525,000, up 8.2
percent from a year earlier. The price of previously owned
condos rose 2.9 percent to $499,000.  Buyers of co-ops in the second quarter paid a median
$260,000, 3.7 percent less than a year earlier and a 12 percent
decrease from the previous three months. The number of co-op
sales rose 8.7 percent from a year earlier to 351.  Purchases of one- to three-family houses in the borough
fell 9.9 percent from a year earlier, and the median price
increased 2 percent to $510,000.  Luxury Properties  Sales of luxury properties, defined by Miller Samuel and
Prudential as the top 10 percent of all transactions by price,
were little changed from a year earlier. The median price was
$1.3 million, a 14 percent gain from the second quarter of 2010.  “The markets that seem to be faring the best are at the
higher ends,” Miller said.  New York  City’s unemployment rate was 8.6 percent in May,
its lowest point in more than two years and below the national
average of 9.1 percent that month, according to the state’s
labor department. The city’s financial industry added 10,400
jobs in the 12 months through May.  Brooklyn homes stayed on the market an average 142 days in
the second quarter, a 38 percent rise from a year earlier,
reflecting an increase in inventory, Miller Samuel and
Prudential said. A total of 7,002 residences were listed for
sale, up 12 percent from a year earlier. At the current pace, it
would take almost 11 months to sell them all, according to the
report.  Gaining Strength  “It’s not like 2007, 2008. You’d put up a listing and
there would be 100 people lined up around the corner,” said
Michael Ettelson, a broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman in
Brooklyn. “But it’s stronger than it has been in the past two
years.”  Ettelson and his team arranged the sale in late June of a
three-bedroom condo in the Prospect Heights neighborhood. The
purchase price for the 2,677-square-foot (249-square-meter)
duplex was $1.2 million, 4 percent less than what the owner
originally sought, Ettelson said. It was on the market for 42
days, according to  StreetEasy.com , a property-listings website.  Sellers pared an average of 3.9 percent off the initial
asking price to strike a deal in the last three months, compared
with a 2.8 percent discount offered a year earlier, according to
Miller Samuel and Prudential.  Real Estate Board  In a separate  report  today, the Real Estate Board of New
York said residential transactions in Brooklyn totaled $1.38
billion in the second quarter, up 8.5 percent from a year
earlier. The median price for all homes climbed 5 percent to
$477,000.  The Cobble Hill neighborhood had the largest median price
increase for condos, co-ops and one- to three-family houses.
Values jumped 96 percent to $1 million, the trade group said.  In Queens, the city’s second-most-populous borough, sales
plunged 41 percent in the second quarter to 2,361, and the
median price climbed 2.1 percent to $342,000, according to
Miller Samuel and Prudential. Homes stayed on the market an
average of 115 days, a 19 percent increase from a year earlier,
and sellers knocked an average of 7.1 percent off asking prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
