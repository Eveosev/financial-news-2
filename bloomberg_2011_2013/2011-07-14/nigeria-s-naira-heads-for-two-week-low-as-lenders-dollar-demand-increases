Nigeria ’s naira weakened to a four-
day low against the dollar after the central bank was unable to
meet demand from lenders for the U.S. currency at an auction
yesterday.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 3.1 percent to 156.95 per dollar in the
interbank market, the biggest intraday decline since Jan. 2009,
and traded down 0.03 percent at 152.25 by 4:30 p.m. in Lagos,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank sold $250 million yesterday, less than the
$410 million demanded by lenders, which was the biggest amount
sought since the June 27 sale.  “Dealers expect the naira to depreciate slightly at the
 interbank market  today due to the surge in demand for foreign
exchange by the end users,” Lagos-based Diamond Bank Plc
analysts wrote in an e-mailed note.  The central bank of Africa’s largest oil producer has been
using foreign-currency reserves to keep the naira within a 3
percentage-point band above or below 150 per dollar at its
twice-weekly auctions.  Foreign-currency reserves stood at $31.7 billion by July 4
compared with $37 billion a year earlier, according to central-
bank data.  The inability of the central bank to meet demand “is
causing scarcity of dollars, with the naira depreciating to 165
per dollar at the black market,” Abubakar Mohammed, the
managing director of Forward Marketing Communication Bureau de
Change, based in Lagos, said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
