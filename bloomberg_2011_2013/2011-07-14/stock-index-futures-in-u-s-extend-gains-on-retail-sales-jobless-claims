U.S. stock futures extended gains
after government data showed retail sales unexpectedly increased
and jobless claims fell more than economists estimated,
bolstering confidence in the economy.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September gained 0.4 percent to 1,317.1 at 8:31 a.m. in  New
York . Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 27 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,452.  The 0.1 percent increase in retail sales reported by the
Commerce Department compared with the median forecast of a 0.1
percent drop in the Bloomberg News survey of 80 economists.
Excluding auto sales, purchases were little changed, the weakest
performance since July 2010. Separate data showed initial
jobless claims fell by 22,000 to 405,000 last week.     Futures rose earlier as higher-than-estimated earnings at
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  erased losses that followed Moody’s
Investors Service’s announcement yesterday that it was reviewing
America’s credit rating.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is scheduled to
testify to the Senate Banking Committee from 10 a.m. in
 Washington  today. He signaled yesterday that the central bank
has more tools for monetary easing should the economy weaken and
stymie efforts to generate jobs for 14.1 million unemployed
Americans.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 95 percent since March 2009 as the
Fed used large-scale asset purchases to buoy the economy and
companies posted earnings that beat analysts’ estimates. The
index has still fallen 3.4 percent since April 29 this year on
concern the economic recovery is at risk and as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis grows.  Moody’s said late yesterday the U.S. government may lose
the Aaa credit rating it’s held since 1917 on concern the
country’s debt limit will not be raised in time to prevent a
missed payment of interest or principal. President  Barack Obama 
is considering summoning congressional leaders to Camp David
this weekend to work on a plan to raise the debt ceiling after
yesterday’s negotiations on a deficit-cutting plan of at least
$2 trillion stalled, two people familiar with the matter said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
