Russia may lift the ban on meat
supplies from some producers in the Brazilian provinces of Mato
Grosso,  Rio Grande  do Sul and Parana by Aug. 10, said
 Rosselkhoznadzor , the Russian food-safety watchdog.  “We will be able to resume meat supplies for certain
producers,” Alexei Alekseenko, Rosselkhoznadzor’s spokesman,
said by phone from Moscow today. The organization is reviewing
documents following a veterinary meat producer audit and talks
with a Brazilian delegation last week.  Brazil ’s veterinary service inspected all 236 companies
that supply meat to Russia and banned 95 of them from making
shipments for failing to meet Russian food safety standards,
Alekseenko said. The companies banned by Brazil don’t entirely
match a list of slaughter companies whose exports were
prohibited by Russia itself, he said.  Beef and pork from eight Brazilian meatpackers was banned
because they “were not familiar with the Russian veterinary and
sanitary requirements and norms,”  Russia ’s health inspector
said April 19, and another 80 companies were added to the list
on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
