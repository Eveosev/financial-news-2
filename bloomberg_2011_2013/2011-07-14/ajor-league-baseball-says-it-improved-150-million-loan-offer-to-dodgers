Major League Baseball  said it
sweetened its offer to loan the Los Angeles Dodgers $150 million
while the team is in bankruptcy, seeking to defeat a rival loan
sought by team owner  Frank McCourt .  Baseball is willing to provide “unsecured financing” that
wouldn’t require any collateral to guarantee repayment, John McHale, executive vice president with the baseball
commissioner’s office, said in a filing today in  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.  Commissioner  Bud Selig  has urged U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Kevin Gross to reject the Dodgers’ request to borrow as much as
$150 million from JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Highbridge Capital
Management LLC. The Highbridge financing charges higher fees and
a higher interest rate than one offered by Major League
Baseball, according to baseball officials.  Selig’s office filed an objection to the proposed
Highbridge loan under seal, saying it contains confidential
information.  The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy on June 27 after Selig
rejected a proposed television-rights deal McCourt negotiated
with  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox Sports.  The Dodgers will ask Gross to approve the Highbridge loan
at a hearing next week. The team claims that it cannot accept
the baseball loan because Selig is hostile to McCourt and the
Dodgers. Gross has already approved a temporary $60 million loan
from Highbridge.  The bankruptcy case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-
12010, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
