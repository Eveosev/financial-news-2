Colombia’s capital city is in talks
with Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA,  Brazil ’s biggest phone
company known as Oi, in a bid to seek financing so the city
doesn’t need to sell its stake in  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones
de Bogota (ETB)  SA, a city official said.  The city is also in talks with potential Korean investors
interested in helping finance the planned expansion of ETB, as
the company serving Colombia’s capital is known, Hector
Zambrano, the city’s secretary of finance, said in an interview
in Bogota.  Bogota’s city council began debating a proposal this week
that would allow the city to sell part or all of its 86.6
percent stake in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
