Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  said it expects
licence revenue for the second quarter to be within a range of
$38.5 million to $39.5 million, according to an e-mailed release
today. This implies like-for-like growth of -2 percent to 1
percent and reported growth of 12 percent to 15 percent, the
statement said.  Given the estimated licence performance in the first half
of the year and the “uncertain outlook” for the remainder of
the year, Temenos has revised downwards its full-year licence
outlook, the statement said. It expects like-for-like growth of
5 percent to 10 percent with an implied range of $176 million to
$184 million, down from the previous forecast of 19 percent to
24 percent, or $197 million to $205 million, Temenos said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
