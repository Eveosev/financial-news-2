Switzerland ’s banking regulator said
it “regularly” puts  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the
country’s biggest banks, through stress tests and has started
doing similar exercises for smaller lenders as well.  “This year we started stress-testing further significant
Swiss banks,” Tobias Lux, a spokesman for the Swiss Financial
Market Supervisory Authority, or Finma, said by telephone today.  The European Union will tomorrow publish the results of its
stress tests on banks, which include a review of how lenders
would handle an economic contraction, a drop in equity markets
and possible trading losses on sovereign debt. Finma doesn’t
plan to publish anything tomorrow as its tests aren’t
coordinated with the EU, Lux said.  UBS and Credit Suisse are sometimes tested more than once a
year, depending on market conditions, he said. Stress tests for
the smaller banks are more “targeted” toward the lenders’ main
lines of business. Finma would, for example, put a bank’s
mortgage portfolio through a stress scenario, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
