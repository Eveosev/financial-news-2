English amateur Tom Lewis birdied
four of the final five holes to tie  Thomas Bjorn  for the lead in
the first round of the British Open.  Lewis, 20, and Denmark’s Bjorn, 40, shot 5-under-par 65 at
Royal St. George’s. Lewis won the 2009 British Boys Amateur
championship at the links course in Sandwich, England. Bjorn got
into the field three days ago after Vijay Singh withdrew with an
injury. Lewis played with  Tom Watson , who the Englishman says
he’s named after. Watson shot a 2-over 72.  Spain’s Miguel Angel Jimenez and American Lucas Glover are
tied for second after shooting 66. U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland is six shots off the lead after
opening with a 1-over-par 71.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
