VCI, the main association of German
chemical companies, raised its forecast for sales, predicting a
record paced by demand from abroad.  Chemical sales will probably increase 10 percent in 2011,
VCI said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s up from a May
forecast for a 9 percent rise. Production is still expected to
gain 5 percent, while prices will probably climb 5 percent
instead of the May prediction of 4 percent, it said.  “Our industry will reach record highs in sales and
production in 2011,” VCI president Klaus Engel said.  Chemical sales in the first half jumped 12 percent from the
last year to 90.5 billion euros ($129 billion), the group said.
Production increased 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
