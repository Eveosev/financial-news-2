BG Group Plc (BG/)  and  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  signed a 20-year contract with SBM Offshore NV for a charter
of an oil-producing vessel at the Lula North East field to
expand output off  Brazil .  SBM Offshore together with partners Queiroz Galvao Oleo e
Gas SA,  Nippon Yusen KK (9101)  and Itochu Corp., secured a $1 billion
loan to finance the construction of the floating production,
storage and offloading vessel, SBM said today in a statement.
The vessel will be able to process 150,000 barrels a day of
fluids, it said.  The Lula field, formerly known as Tupi, is the Americas’
largest oil discovery in more than 30 years.  Lula North East has reached a pumping rate of 18,000
barrels a day, which was constrained by the field’s
infrastructure, Reading, England-based BG said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
