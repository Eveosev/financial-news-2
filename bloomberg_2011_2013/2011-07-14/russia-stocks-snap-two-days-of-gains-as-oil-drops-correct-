(Corrects the date of Moody’s last review to 1996 in the
third paragraph.)  Russian stocks snapped two days of
gains as oil fell in  London  after the U.S.’s credit rating was
put under review for a downgrade, stoking speculation a slowdown
in economic growth may temper fuel demand.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks declined 0.3 percent to
1,708.59 by 3:22 p.m. in Moscow, paring an earlier decline of as
much as 0.9 percent. Oil producer OAO Tatneft decreased 1.1
percent while OAO Transneft, the oil pipeline operator, fell 0.8
percent. OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s natural gas export monopoly, sank
0.6 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index traded little
changed at 1,935.81.  Brent crude  fell as much as 0.9 percent, halting a two-day
rally after Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it would
reconsider the U.S.’s Aaa rating for the first time since 1996.
Oil also slid after the U.S. Energy Department reported
yesterday that gasoline demand fell 3.2 percent in the week
ended July 8, at a time when consumption typically rises during
the peak driving season.  “Markets have another worry this morning, with Moody’s
having taken the U.S. sovereign rating under review with a view
to a downgrade, along with thousands of other ratings linked to
the country one,” Slava Smolyaninov, deputy head of research at
UralSib Financial Corp., wrote in an e-mailed comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
