Charter International Plc (CHTR) , a U.K.
welding and automation-equipment maker, said  Melrose Plc (MRO) , an
investment firm, raised its possible offer price for the company
to 840 pence a share.  Charter is considering the approach, which is subject to
financing and due diligence, the London-based company said in a
statement today. The proposed offer would be a mix of shares and
cash, it said. Shareholders should take no action, it said.  The indicative offer, which values the company at about 1.4
billion pounds ($2.3 billion), is 7.7 percent more than the 780
pence-a-share Melrose offered on June 29, which Charter
rejected.  The first approach from Melrose, which is run by a former
team at industrial company Wassall Plc, followed the departure
of Chief Executive Officer Michael Foster last month. Charter
said June 20 that full-year profit will be below initial
forecasts and announced a fresh wave of cost cutting.  Charterâ€™s shares rose as much as 4.3 percent, closing up
1.3 percent at 829 pence at 4:30 p.m. in  London . Melrose fell
0.6 percent to 359.8 pence, having earlier gained 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
