What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on concern that hot, dry
weather may hurt crops in the U.S., where export sales increased
for the third straight week, said Jim Riley, a broker at the
Linn Group in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that a heat wave will extend into
August, reducing Midwest yields, Riley said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open steady to 0.1 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open down $1 to up $1 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that demand for U.S. supplies will
ease because of increasing Russian and Ukraine production, Riley
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
