Corn futures fell from a four-week
high on speculation that demand for the feed grain will slow as
cheaper wheat prices encourage livestock producers to switch.  Russia , which lifted a ban on wheat exports July 1, may
harvest 90 million metric tons of grain this year, First Deputy
Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov said, up from 85 million forecast a
month ago. Ukraine’s wheat crop may be 19.3 million tons,
researcher APK-Inform said. Cash corn in Chicago is 25 cents a
bushel more expensive than wheat, compared with an average
discount of more than $1 the prior two years, U.S. government
data show.  “Rising wheat production in Russia and Ukraine will cut
world feed demand for corn,” Gregg Hunt, a broker at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said by telephone. “Corn is
no longer the cheapest feed ingredient.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.25 cents, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $6.785 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Yesterday, the price rose to $6.88, the
highest for the most-active contract since June 15.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
