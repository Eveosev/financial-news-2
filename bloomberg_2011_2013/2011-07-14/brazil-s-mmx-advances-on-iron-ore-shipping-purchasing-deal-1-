MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the
iron-ore producer controlled by Brazilian billionaire Eike Batista, rose after signing an agreement to purchase and ship
raw material produced by a rival through one of its ports.  MMX advanced 1.5 percent to 8.80 reais at the close of Sao
Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after earlier jumping
as much as 5.2 percent, the biggest intraday gain since May 17.
The Bovespa index slid 1.6 percent to 59,679.35.  Minerinvest Mineracao Ltda. agreed to ship as much as five
million tons of iron-ore through Superporto Sudeste, a port MMX
is building in Rio de Janeiro state, for 10 years starting in
2013, according to a regulatory filing. In exchange, MMX will
buy the commodity used in steelmaking from Minerinvest at $64 a
ton during the same period, a price that Bank of America Corp.
says is “below market.”  “This is a very positive development for MMX’s
shareholders,” Credit Suisse Group AG’s analysts Ivan Fadel and
Carlos Louro wrote in a note to clients today. The deal will
allow MMX “to increase its iron-ore sales capacity, without
having to disburse any cash amount.”  The transaction needs to be approved by MMX’s and
Minerinvest’s boards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
