China Gezhouba Group Co. fell the
second most among 946 stocks traded in  Shanghai  trading after
China Construction Bank Corp. cut its stake in the company
involved in construction and water treatment projects.  Gezhouba slid 3 percent to 11.93 yuan at 10:41 a.m. after
the second-biggest Chinese bank reduced its stake to 6.45
percent. The stock has gained 57 percent over the past year,
compared with a 13 percent drop for the Shanghai Composite
Index. The company has benefited from increased  government
investment  in water conservation projects to alleviate droughts
and support the economy. The government plans to spend 4
trillion yuan building water conservancy projects over the next
10 years and 54 billion yuan on hydropower projects over the
following five years, Yang Tao, an analyst at Citic Securities,
wrote in a report June 27.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
