Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest
primary silver producer, said second-quarter output rose 7.2
percent to a record after its Saucito mine began operating.  So-called attributable production grew to 11.367 million
ounces from 10.604 million ounces a year earlier, the  Mexico 
City-based company said today in a statement. Production
included 906,000 ounces from the Silverstream agreement, an
accord between Fresnillo and Mexico’s Industrias Penoles SAB.  Earnings at the company may also benefit as silver prices
more than doubled in the second quarter to an average $38.50 an
ounce, compared with $18.30 a year earlier. Second-quarter gold
production rose 21 percent to 110,070 ounces, it said. Fresnillo
maintained its full-year production estimate of 44 million
ounces of silver and 400,000 ounces of gold.  “This is another excellent quarter for the Mexican
precious-metals giant,” Collins Stewart Plc wrote in a report.
“Hitting or exceeding targets has become a habit for Fresnillo,
with the company set to report record profitability in the first
half, benefiting greatly from high gold and silver prices.”  Fresnillo rose 4.9 percent to 1,595 pence by the 4:30 p.m.
close in London trading. The company is the third-best-
performing stock in the  FTSE 350 Mining Index (F3MNG)  in the past six
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
