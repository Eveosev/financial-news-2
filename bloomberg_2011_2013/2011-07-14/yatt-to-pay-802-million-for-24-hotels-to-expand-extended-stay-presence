Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H) , the chain
controlled by the Pritzker family, said it agreed to buy 24
properties for about $802 million in cash to expand its
extended-stay lodging business.  The company will buy the hotels from LodgeWorks LP, a
closely held developer, and its private-equity partners,
Chicago-based Hyatt said in a statement today. The purchase
includes management, franchise and intellectual-property rights.  Hyatt is looking to expand its footprint across the U.S.
The acquisition will add hotels in nine markets where the
company currently doesn’t have any, and allow it to enter the
extended-stay market in 16 areas.  “This is a significant expansion of our presence in the
 United States  and enhances our extended-stay representation with
a great collection of high-quality hotels,” Mark Hoplamazian,
president and chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The hotels to be purchased carry the Hotel Sierra, AVIA
Hotels, Hyatt Place and Hyatt Summerfield Suites brands.  Sixteen Hotel Sierra properties will become Hyatt
Summerfield Suites, an extended-stay brand. Five hotels,
including those carrying the AVIA name, are expected to be
converted to full-service Hyatt brands. The transaction is
expected to be completed in the current quarter.  The hotels will be managed by Hyatt, which as of March had
451 properties in 43 countries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
