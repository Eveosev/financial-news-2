Peru ’s central bank made its biggest
dollar purchase in a year as local companies selling dollars to
pay worker bonuses kept the sol at its highest level since 2008.  The central bank bought $276 million today, the most since
July 2010, paying an average 2.7415 soles per dollar, it said on
its website.  The sol strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 2.7410 per
 U.S. dollar  at today’s close, from 2.7415 yesterday, according
to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  “Companies have until tomorrow to pay mid-year bonuses and
those that have revenue in dollars have to sell them to pay
bonuses,” said  Roberto Flores , an economist at Lima-based
brokerage Inteligo SAB. “The expiry of dollar forward contracts
has been pressuring the sol in the last few days.”  Demand for soles also rose this week as Peruvian exporters
led by mining companies paid local income taxes, causing the
central bank to step up dollar purchases in the  spot market . The
bank bought $78 million yesterday and $79 million July 12.  The purchases helped reduce the net dollar holdings of
Peruvian banks to $430 million on July 12 from $556 million a
day earlier, according to the central bank.  Still, the banks’ dollar surplus will keep pressure on the
sol, making Peruvian companies less competitive in the
international market by making their goods more expensive in
dollar terms, Peruvian exporter group Adex said in an e-mailed
statement.  The central bank should take “special” measures to halt
further appreciation in the sol, Adex said.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 was little changed at 6.298
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
