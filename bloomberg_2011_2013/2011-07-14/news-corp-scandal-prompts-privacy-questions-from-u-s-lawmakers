U.S. lawmakers pressed regulators to
address whether consumers’ phones are vulnerable to hackers and
asked what federal agencies are doing to protect privacy amid
allegations of hacking by a  News Corp. (NWSA)  newspaper.  Representative Mary Bono Mack asked Federal Communications
Commission Chairman  Julius Genachowski  at a House hearing today
whether “American consumers are as vulnerable as politicians
and celebrities in London.”  “We often hear that privacy laws in Europe are much
stricter than they are in the U.S.,” said Bono Mack, a
California Republican and chairman of the subcommittee on
commerce and trade. “If that’s so, it’s hard to understand how
the phone hacking incidents in Britain could have gotten so far
out of hand.”  Employees of News Corp.’s now-defunct News of the World are
accused of hacking hundreds of voicemails, including those of
murder and terrorism victims, and bribing police for
confidential information. The scandal led New York-based News
Corp. yesterday to drop its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.5 billion)
bid for full control of  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY)   The Federal Bureau of Investigation is examining whether
employees of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. tried to hack into the
phones of Sept. 11 victims. “We’re aware of certain allegations
pertaining to a possible hacking by News Corp. personnel and
we’re looking into those charges,”  Jim Margolin , a spokesman
for the FBI’s New York office, said in a phone interview today.  Calls for Investigations  At least six U.S. lawmakers yesterday urged government
agencies including the Justice Department and Securities and
Exchange Commission to investigate possible violations of U.S.
law. Among them were Democratic Senators Jay Rockefeller of  West
Virginia ,  Barbara Boxer  of California, and  Frank Lautenberg  and
 Robert Menendez  of  New Jersey .  “The reported allegations against News Corporation are
very serious, indicate a pattern of illegal activity, and
involve thousands of potential victims,” Boxer and Rockefeller
said in a joint statement. “It is important to ensure that no
United States laws were broken and no United States citizens
were victimized.”  The U.S.  Justice Department  is reviewing the lawmakers’
letters,  Laura Sweeney , an agency spokeswoman, said yesterday,
declining to comment further.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman,
declined to comment.  9/11 Families  Boxer, Rockefeller, and Menendez yesterday cited
accusations that News Corp. employees had hacked into the phones
of Sept. 11 victims and requested a probe of whether the privacy
of any U.S. citizen was violated. Two New York Representatives,
Republican Peter King and Democrat Louise Slaughter, also called
for probes into U.S. 9/11 victims were targeted.  “I feel that the FBI should investigate whether News Corp.
hacked into voicemails of 9/11 families,” Sally Regenhard, vice
chair of the 9/11 Parents & Families of Firefighters and WTC
Victims, said in an e-mail.  “If this proves to be true, then it is an egregious
violation of personal privacy and security,” Regenhard said.
“This is a further victimization of a group which has already
been victimized by the deaths of their loved ones on 9/11.”  Representative Bruce Braley, an Iowa Democrat, today called
for an investigation by the House Oversight and Government
Reform Committee into whether News Corp. violated U.S.
anticorruption law and hacked into phones of U.S. citizens.  The committee “has a duty to protect the privacy of
Americans and to hold U.S. corporations accountable,” Braley
wrote in a letter to the oversight panel’s chairman,
Representative  Darrell Issa , a  California  Republican.  Wiretap Laws  At today’s hearing, Representative Anna Eshoo, a California
Democrat, called on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to
investigate the “burgeoning scandal of News Corp.”  Asked by Bono Mack if there are sufficient safeguards to
protect U.S. citizens from the phone hacking alleged to have
taken place in Britain, Genachowski said there are “several
laws in place that address hacking issues,” including federal
wiretap laws and state laws.  Teri Everett, a News Corp. spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
respond to requests for comment today.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  Protecting Children  The phone-hacking and bribery allegations at News of the
World prompted News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
 Rupert Murdoch  to close the 168-year-old tabloid. It published
its last edition on July 10.  The News of the World scandal was one of several privacy-
related topics explored during today’s hearing as members asked
whether more legislation or regulation is needed to protect
consumer data online.  Several lawmakers talked about online protections for
children, including Representatives  Edward Markey , a
Massachusetts Democrat, and Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, who
jointly introduced on May 13 “do not track kids” legislation,
which would require online companies to obtain parental consent
for collecting children’s personal information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
