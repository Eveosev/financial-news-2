The first-ever expansion of the U.S.
patent office beyond the nation’s capital has Denver, Silicon
Valley and Austin,  Texas , envisioning the next Research Triangle
and an accompanying jobs windfall.  Legislation giving the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office in
Alexandria, Virginia, more budget autonomy starting next fiscal
year clears the way for three new offices, in addition to a
fourth in Detroit that had been in the works. Lawmakers
including U.S. Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Senator
Michael Bennet of  Colorado  are lobbying for offices in their
districts.  Moving the patent office beyond its suburban  Washington ,
D.C., home base is intended to speed up an almost three-year-
long patent approval process, which requires face-to-face
meetings between inventors and agency examiners. The offices
would bring jobs, including 100 planned for Detroit in the first
year, and might serve as a magnet for companies looking to be
near the new offices.  “It’s sort of like what Research Triangle did” by landing
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ’s research facility, said
LaCharles Keesee, 46, a former patent examiner who is now
executive director for the Denver Office of Economic
Development. “You could plant a scientific flag in the middle
of your community and use that as a point of attraction to build
an education community, an employment community.”  Research Triangle Park, in the Raleigh-Durham area of  North
Carolina , was created in the 1950s by a partnership of
universities and corporations to boost the state’s economy. The
development has at least 170 companies including IBM,  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , with 38,000 full-time
jobs, according to the  foundation  that oversees the facilities.  Patent Leaders  California , headquarters for Apple Inc. and Microsoft
Corp., led U.S. states in patents granted last year, with
27,337, about 13 percent of the total issued, according to
 government data . Texas followed with 7,545. Colorado, home to
the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ranked 14th, just
after North Carolina.  Representatives of the patent agency, which employs about
9,500 people, including more than 6,000 examiners, wouldn’t say
when the offices would open or discuss the selection process.  Representative Doggett, a Democrat, pitched his state’s
capital of Austin to patent office Director David Kappos in an
April 4 letter also signed by three Republican representatives
from Texas. A central Texas location would benefit computer
maker  Dell Inc. (DELL) , based in Round Rock, and IBM, which employs
technology workers in the area, as well as smaller companies.  Austin’s ‘Ideal Location’  Texas is building “a trail of world-quality innovation,
research, and entrepreneurship, and it puts Austin at the center
of the next generation of technological breakthroughs,” making
it “the ideal location,” Doggett said in an e-mail response to
questions.  Bennet and Senator Mark Udall, both Democrats, sent
President Barack Obama a letter last year saying their state of
Colorado is “perfectly suited to ensure a qualified
workforce.” In a follow-up  statement  in February they said an
office would create jobs and encourage innovation.  “As a gateway of the West, Colorado is perfectly situated
to connect innovators and businesses across the country.”
Bennet said in an e-mail in response to questions.  Silicon Valley  Carl Guardino, chief executive officer of the  Silicon
Valley Leadership Group  in San Jose, California, which
represents 345 area businesses including Apple,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and
Cisco said members of his group have met with 100 members of
Congress to push for an office in California.  “You hunt where the game is and the game is here in
Silicon Valley,” Guardino said in an interview.  While Keesee argued that Denver would be ideal, he said
cities in the Northwest including Portland,  Oregon , and  Seattle 
should be considered, as well as Atlanta.  “As an examiner, it would be hard to overlook Atlanta”
partly because of universities that have significant advanced
programs in science and engineering, he said. “It’s a city that
has all the things I just mentioned on steroids.”  For the patent office, the satellite offices would provide
a bigger labor pool at a time when the agency is trying to
increase the number of examiners and cut down on turnover. It
also would mean greater proximity to inventors, when increased
direct interaction is seen as a way to focus applications and
speed up the process, known as a patent prosecution.  Application Backlog  “It’s a challenge for any company in the country to have
to go and defend their patent,” Erika Sumner, vice president
for public policy for the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce,
said in an interview. “It makes sense to do it in a region.”  There are almost 700,000 patent applications awaiting the
first review by an examiner, and it takes, on average, about 34
months for the agency to complete the process. Kappos has said
the new offices would increase the number of face-to-face patent
examinations, which would likely lead to more efficient and
quicker reviews.  “It helps move things along,” said Christopher Ott, a
trademark and copyright lawyer with Vorys Sater Seymour & Pease
LLP in Washington and a former patent examiner. “Sometimes
things don’t translate as well when you type them out.”  Legislation  approved by the  House of Representatives  last
month gives the agency more control over its funding, sets new
rules on how applications and issued patents are reviewed, and
authorizes the satellite offices. The bill needs to be
reconciled with a Senate measure passed in March and then signed
by Obama. The commitment for the Detroit office, made in 2010
prior to the legislation, had been put on hold after Congress
limited the money the agency could spend this fiscal year.  Detroit Tech Boom  Detroit was selected first because of the area’s high
percentage of scientists and engineers, as well as its patent
output, the agency said in March. Expertise in cloud computing,
mobile-software applications and energy management have been in
demand as automakers including  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor
Co. (F)  replace car stereos with Internet radio and gasoline engines
with motors powered by lithium-ion batteries.  Online streaming music providers Pandora Media Inc. and Mog
Inc., have opened offices in the area. Google, based in Mountain
View, California, has a facility in Birmingham,  Michigan , where
it’s been looking for sales associates to work with the auto
industry. Technology job postings in the Detroit area doubled
last year, making it the fastest-expanding region in the country
for technology jobs, according to  Dice Holdings Inc. (DHX) , a job-
listing website.  ‘Obvious Location’  The remote offices may also help the agency recruit
examiners who may not want to live in the Washington area.  “When you open offices in places where people want to be,
like Austin and California, it increases the likelihood you get
people in the door,” Ott said.  While he has been lobbying lawmakers, Guardino said he
hoped the decision would be left to the patent office and away
from political influence. Silicon Valley would emerge as “the
obvious location,” he said, even with its high cost of living.  Whatever the location, local officials agree it’s time for
the patent office to expand its footprint to areas responsible
for the most patents.  Virginia  and Washington, D.C. were ranked
20th and 49th in patents issued last year, trailing states
including Arizona,  Florida ,  Massachusetts  and Wisconsin.  “The patent community is way too centralized in
Washington,” Keesee said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
