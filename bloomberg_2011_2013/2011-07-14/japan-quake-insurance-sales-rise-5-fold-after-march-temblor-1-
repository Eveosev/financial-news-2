Earthquake-insurance sales to
 Japan ’s homeowners grew more than five times in April from a
year ago following the nation’s record temblor in March, a
report by Non-Life Insurance Rating Organization of Japan
showed.  A total of 130,776 new policies were sold in April,
compared with 23,847 in the same month a year earlier, according
to the report. Insurers had a total of 12.87 million earthquake
policies in the month, 4.7 percent more from April 2010, it
said.  An increase in demand for earthquake insurance comes after
Japan was hit by a magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on
March 11, leading to the country’s worst disaster since World
War II. Pressure is rising to increase the maximum coverage for
holders of quake insurance from the current 50 million yen for
structure and 10 million yen for contents.  “I’ve bought the insurance after the quake because some of
the damages on structure and contents have been covered after
the latest temblor,” said Yasuko Morikawa, 36, a homeowner in
 Tokyo . “But the coverage is still too low.”  The catastrophe destroyed or damaged more than 530,000
homes, many from the tsunami generated by the seismic upheaval.
Earthquake payouts totaled 1.05 trillion yen, or 598,339
policies as of July 7, according to the General Insurance
Association of Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
