Taiwan’s dollar gained for a second
day after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank may add more funds to the economy to support a
recovery, sending the U.S. currency lower.  The Taiwan dollar rallied in each of the past four quarters
as overseas investors snapped up equities.  Interest rates  on the
island are 1.875 percent compared with a maximum 0.25 percent in
the U.S. Bernanke said the Fed may consider buying more
government debt should the economy be in danger of stalling.  “Bernanke’s comments led to a weak greenback today and
supported Asian currencies,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based
foreign-exchange trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. “If the
U.S. really imposes a third round of quantitative easing, more
funds will go to Taiwan and drive up the local currency.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.2 percent to NT$28.839
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.00 yesterday,
the weakest level since June 28, and is down 0.1 percent from
the end of last month.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 2
percent notes due July 2016, the most-traded government debt,
was 1.159 percent, compared with 1.16 percent yesterday, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show.  The government is due to auction NT$30 billion ($1 billion)
of five-year securities tomorrow. The debt may yield 1.155
percent, according to the median estimate of six finance
companies in a Bloomberg News survey.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, gained one basis point to 0.379 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
