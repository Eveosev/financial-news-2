Roger Clemens defense attorney,
 Rusty Hardin , asked for a mistrial in the ex-pitcher’s perjury
case after U.S. prosecutors showed jurors a video clip from a
congressional hearing where the wife of ball player  Andy
Pettitte  was mentioned. U.S. District Judge  Reggie Walton  ruled
before the trial that Pettitte’s wife could not be referred to
by the government in its case in chief.  To contact the reporter on this story:
