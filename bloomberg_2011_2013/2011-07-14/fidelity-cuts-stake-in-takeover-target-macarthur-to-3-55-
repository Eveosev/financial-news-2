FMR LLC,  Fidelity Investments ’
corporate holding company, cut its stake in Australian takeover
target  Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC)  to 3.55 percent and ceased to be a
major shareholder, according to an exchange filing.  Fidelity, which had been the fourth-biggest holder in
Brisbane-based Macarthur with 6.01 percent, sold 7.7 million
shares, reducing its holding to 10.7 million shares, according
to the statement filed today with the Australian stock exchange.
It didn’t disclose the buyer’s name.  ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, and Peabody
Energy Corp. on July 11 made a A$4.7 billion ($5.1 billion)
takeover proposal through a joint bid for Macarthur, the world’s
biggest producer of pulverized coal used in steelmaking.  Buying Macarthur would give  ArcelorMittal (MT) , its second-
largest shareholder, and Peabody mines producing steelmaking
coal in  Australia , the world’s biggest exporter, as prices trade
near a record and suitors vie for targets.  Peabody holds 60 percent and Arcelor 40 percent in a bid
vehicle, which offered A$15.50 a share in cash, less the amount
of any final dividend, which is estimated at 19 cents, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Macarthur rose 26 cents to A$15.26 at 12:54 p.m. Sydney
time, taking gains this year to 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
