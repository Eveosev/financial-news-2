Boeing Co. lost an order for 35
single-aisle 737s from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., the
leasing company that canceled its remaining order from Airbus
SAS last week.  The Boeing jet order was valued at about $2.8 billion at
 list prices . Dubai Aerospace still has 15 747-8 jumbo jets and
six 777s on order from Boeing, said  Marc Birtel , a spokesman for
the planemaker in Seattle.  The state-owned Gulf company was set up in 2006 with the
goal of becoming one of the world’s biggest aircraft lessors. It
ordered 200 airliners from Airbus and Boeing, the world’s
biggest planemakers, at the 2007 Dubai air show, only to scale
back the plans when its finances weakened during the global
recession.  Airbus said last week that Dubai Aerospace had dropped
orders for 34 single-aisle A320s and 11 A350 widebodies, leaving
it with no more purchase contracts after previous cancellations
in the past year. The lessor has also cut its planned purchase
of 15 Boeing 787 Dreamliners and the other 32 737s it had
ordered.  Dubai Aerospace didn’t respond to requests for comment
today after business hours in the emirate. Robert Genise, chief
executive officer at Dubai Aerospace’s DAE Capital leasing unit,
left the company last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
