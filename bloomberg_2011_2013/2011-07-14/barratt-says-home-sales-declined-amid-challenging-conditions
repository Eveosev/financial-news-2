Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV) , Britain’s
largest homebuilder by volume, sold 1.8 percent fewer homes in
fiscal 2011 as it pursued margin growth over volume.  Barratt’s sales fell to 11,171 in the 12 months through
June from 11,377 a year earlier, the London-based company said
today in a statement. The average price climbed to about 204,000
pounds ($329,000) from 195,000 pounds, Barratt said.  The U.K. housing market is struggling to gain momentum as
banks restrict lending, inflation squeezes households and
government budget cuts limit  consumer confidence . Unemployment
claims rose last month at the fastest pace since May 2009,
casting doubt on whether the economy is generating enough jobs
to offset the deepest budget reductions since World War II.  “We don’t expect to see any significant change until there
is a sustained improvement in the mortgage market,” Chief
Executive Officer Mark Clare said on a conference call with
reporters. “Volumes and pricing growth will inevitably be
constrained.”  Clare said Barratt will report a “small” net loss for
fiscal 2011. Analysts estimate the company made a loss of about
27.5 million pounds, according to the average of five forecasts
in a Bloomberg survey. Operating profit excluding one-time gains
and losses rose to about 135 million pounds from 90.1 million
pounds, Barratt said.  The homebuilder fell as much as 2.9 percent to 108 pence in
 London  trading and was down 2.3 percent at 9:45 a.m. The shares
have gained 13 percent in the past six months.  Economy’s Weakness  A U.K. house-price gauge showed little improvement in June
as the country’s “subdued” economic prospects crimped demand
for real estate, the  Royal Institution  of Chartered Surveyors
said July 12.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Halifax mortgage-
lending unit said July 6 that  home prices  rose the most in eight
months in June because of a shortage of properties for sale.  Barratt expects sales volumes to be the highest in about
three years in fiscal 2012, Clare said. The company will sell as
many as 10 percent more homes as it adds sales outlets across
the country.  “If we assume the sales rates that we’ve achieved in the
second half, which is more than normal, then we would expect to
see growth in volume of 5 to 10 percent,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
