Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that’s been expanding since the financial crisis, hired
Daniel Gilman as a managing director in municipal securities
trading as the firm bolsters its fixed-income unit.  Gilman previously was co-head of investments at private-
equity firm Fundamental Advisors LP, New York-based Jefferies
said in an e-mailed statement that it plans to publish today. He
worked nine years at  Citigroup Inc. (C)  as a managing director in
municipal securities with a focus on distressed trading,
Jefferies said.  Jefferies fortified its fixed-income business by hiring
traders from banks including UBS AG, Morgan Stanley, Barclays
Plc and Deutsche Bank AG. Revenue from fixed-income trading rose
2.3 percent to $223.1 million in the fiscal second quarter from
the same period last year, Jefferies said in June. Compensation
costs climbed 12 percent to $431.9 million, or 59 percent of
revenue, as headcount expanded 14 percent to 3,222 employees.  “With more than 20 years of fixed-income experience, he
brings extensive knowledge and relationships to our established
municipal securities platform,” James McGinley, head of
municipal markets, said in the statement.  Jefferies said in June that it hired Brian Chadwick from
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as managing director for U.S. rates
sales. The firm also added Clifford Lanier from Deutsche Bank to
head fixed-income cross-product sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
