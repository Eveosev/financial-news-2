The Czech ruling-coalition party
Public Affairs opposes the  Finance Ministry â€™s budget proposals
as it seeks more money for education and transportation, the
news website  Idnes.cz  reported, citing Chairman Radek John.  Public Affairs, the smallest of the three governing
parties, criticized the budget plans less than two weeks after
the government members signed an amendment to their ruling
agreement to avert a breakup of the coalition, Idnes.cz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
