Cofinimmo (COFB)  SA,  Belgium ’s biggest
real-estate investment fund, said it will set up a jointly owned
company to build a prison in the southwestern city of Leuze-en-
Hainaut.  Cofinimmo will contribute half of the venture’s equity
initially and take over the remaining 50 percent stake from
partners Cordeel Zetel Temse NV and Willemen Groep NV upon
delivery, which is planned in the fourth quarter of 2013, the
Brussels-based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  The prison venture, to be called FPR Leuze SA, will cost
about 100 million euros ($142 million). FPR Leuze will finance
the project from equity and a short-term loan, which it will
repay upon delivery using proceeds from the sale of 90 percent
of the receivables for the construction, due to be paid over a
25-year period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
