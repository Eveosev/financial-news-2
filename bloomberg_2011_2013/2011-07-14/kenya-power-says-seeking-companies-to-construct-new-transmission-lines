Kenya  Power Ltd., the East African
nation’s sole power distributor, is looking for companies to
build 224 kilometers (139 miles) of 132-kilovolt lines.  Interested companies have until Aug. 8 to express interest
in construction of the single transmission line from the
existing Kindaruma power station to the new proposed Mwingi
facility and onward to the proposed Garissa substation, the
company said in a statement in the Nairobi-based Daily Nation
newspaper today.  The project, which is expected to be complete in 24 months,
will be funded by part of a loan Kenya received from the World
Bank’s International Development Association, it said.  In March, Kenya Power  said  it will spend 1.4 billion
shillings ($15.6 million) improving voltage quality in Nairobi,
the capital, and surrounding areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
