Sierra Leoneâ€™s parliament amended a
petroleum bill approved on July 12 to remove a clause that paid
5 percent of fiscal revenue from the oil industry to lawmakers.  The legislation was revised after President Ernest Bai Koroma refused to sign it into law, according to a letter from
the secretary to the president, Osho Coker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
