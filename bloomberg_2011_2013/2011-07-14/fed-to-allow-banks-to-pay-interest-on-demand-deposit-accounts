The  Federal Reserve  has adopted a
rule allowing member banks of the Fed system to pay interest on
demand-deposit accounts.  The rule implements a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the
law enacted last year that revamps financial regulations in
response to the financial crisis.  The rule takes effect on July 21, the central bank said in
a statement today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
