The bonds of  General Maritime Corp. (GMR) ,
the second-largest U.S. oil-tanker owner, fell to the lowest on
record after the company changed the terms of its loans to avoid
breaking the conditions of its credit agreements.  Its $300 million of 12 percent bonds due November 2017
dropped 8 cents to 70 cents on the dollar at 1:41 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt, originally
sold in November 2009, has dropped from 106.8 cents in
September.  Under the terms of the amendment announced yesterday, the
company will be required to maintain a minimum balance in cash
and cash equivalents and availability on its revolving credit
line of $35 million through Dec. 31, which was reduced from $50
million. General Maritime must also have a minimum cash balance
of $40 million through March 31.  Jeffrey Pribor, the company’s chief financial officer,
didn’t return a call for comment.  Nordea Bank Finland Plc and DnB NOR Bank ASA are the lead
arrangers on the $550 million revolver and $372 million senior
secured credit facility, General Maritime said in a statement
yesterday. Oaktree Capital Management LP acted as lender and
administrative agent on the $200 million credit facility, the
company said.  Overseas Shipholding Group is the largest U.S.-based oil-
tanker owner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
