Lebanon’s trade deficit widened 10
percent in the first five months from a year earlier on higher
energy imports, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall increased to $5.95 billion from $5.4 billion,
the highest level in five years in terms of value, the Beirut-
based ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  Imports rose 7 percent to $7.65 billion, driven by a 7
percent gain in the cost of mineral fuels and oils, according to
the ministry. Exports decreased 1 percent from a year earlier to
$1.7 billion as shipments to Arab countries fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
