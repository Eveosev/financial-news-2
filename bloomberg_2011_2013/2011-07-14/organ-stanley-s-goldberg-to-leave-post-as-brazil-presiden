Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said Daniel Goldberg, who was named
president of the firm in  Brazil  last year, will leave that
position to start an investment firm.  Goldberg will also become the non-executive chairman of
Morgan Stanley Brazil, effective July 31, according to an
internal memo today from Christopher Harland, the firm’s
regional head of  Latin America . The memo’s contents were
confirmed by Mary Claire Delaney, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman
in New York.  Goldberg, a Brazilian, joined Morgan Stanley’s Sao Paulo
office in February 2007 after serving as head of the antitrust
and consumer protection agency within Brazil’s justice ministry.
He was head of Morgan Stanley’s investment banking in the
country before becoming president.  “During his almost five years at Morgan Stanley Brazil,
Daniel has helped build a franchise that has never been
stronger,” Harland wrote in the memo. “Today we have a robust
pipeline in banking and impressive performance across all of our
sales and trading businesses.”  Goldberg’s investment firm will focus on special
situations, according to the memo. Farallon Capital Management
LLC will have a minority stake in the firm, according to the
memo.  The departure was reported earlier by Veja magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
