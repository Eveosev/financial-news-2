Indonesia’s rupiah strengthened for
a second day after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the U.S. may buy more  government bonds , fanning concern the
supply of dollars will increase.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, dropped by the most
since October 2010 yesterday as Moody’s Investors Service put
the U.S. debt rating on review for possible downgrade for the
first time since 1995. The central bank “remains prepared to
respond should economic developments indicate that an adjustment
of monetary policy would be appropriate,” Bernanke said.  “The market’s initial reaction to Bernanke’s semi-annual
testimony is that the Fed has moved closer to providing
additional monetary-policy stimulus,” said  Prakriti Sofat , a
regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in  Singapore . “This has
led to broad dollar weakness.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.1 percent to 8,535 per dollar as
of 9:38 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It has advanced 5.2 percent this year as global funds bought
$2.5 billion more Indonesian shares than they sold, according to
exchange data.  Overseas holdings of Indonesia’s government debt rose 22
percent this year through July 8 to 239.3 trillion rupiah ($28
billion),  figures  from the finance ministry show.  Ten-year benchmark bonds were little changed yesterday. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 was at 7.32 percent,
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
