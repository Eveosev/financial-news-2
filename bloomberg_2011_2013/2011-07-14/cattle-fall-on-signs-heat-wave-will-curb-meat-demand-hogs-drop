Cattle futures fell the most this
month on speculation that a heat wave in the U.S. will curb red-
meat consumption. Hog futures also declined.  An excessive heat watch, meaning temperatures will feel
hotter than 105 degrees Fahrenheit (41 Celsius), has been issued
for eastern  Kansas  and  Nebraska , according to the  National
Weather Service . Meatpackers are concerned that beef demand and
prices will slow at the end of the month, said Troy Vetterkind,
the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage in Chicago.  “If there’s going to be hot weather, you’re going to have
lower red-meat consumption,” said  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis .
“Most people eat lighter. They won’t go out to eat a steak.”  Cattle futures for October delivery declined 1.225 cents,
or 1 percent, to $1.18675 a pound at 9:33 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. A close at that price would be the biggest
decline since June 27. Yesterday, the commodity reached $1.214,
the highest for a most-active contract since April 4, when
cattle fetched an all-time high of $1.21625. Before today, the
price rallied 30 percent in the past year.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.625 cent, or 0.7
percent, to 92.6 cents a pound in  Chicago . Before today, the
commodity gained 26 percent in the past year.  Yesterday, spot-market hog prices fell 1.2 percent to 90.34
cents a pound, the lowest since June 14, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement dropped 1.525
cents, or 1.1 percent, to $1.38375 a pound, after touching
$1.3825, the lowest since July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
