Germany  plans to sell patrol ships
to the Angolan navy to help it “modernize” its fleet and
enable the southwestern African nation to protect its maritime
borders, Angola President Jose Eduardo  dos Santos  said.  “We received this proposal now, the discussions have
started,” Dos Santos told reporters yesterday in the capital,
Luanda. The country isn’t “locked” to its “traditional”
supppliers of equipment for its air force, ground troops and
navy and there can be “an opening” for new ones, Dos Santos
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
