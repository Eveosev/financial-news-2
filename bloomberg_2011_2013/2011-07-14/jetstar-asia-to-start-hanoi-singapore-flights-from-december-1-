Jetstar Asia Airways Pte, the budget
unit of  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) , plans to start flights between
Hanoi and Singapore starting Dec. 15 as it seeks to benefit from
rising travel demand in the Southeast Asian region.  The carrier will also add a daily flight between Singapore
and  Ho Chi Minh City  from Aug. 18 to expand the frequency
between the two financial hubs to three flights a day, Jetstar
said in a statement in Hanoi today.  Jetstar yesterday said it plans to add a daily service
between Melbourne and Beijing later this year. The carrier aims
to have as many as 12 routes to China by the end of the year.  “Vietnam and China are both rapid growth markets,”
Jetstar Group Chief Executive Officer  Bruce Buchanan  said in an
interview.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editor: Vipin Nair  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
