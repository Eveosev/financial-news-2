The dollar gained against the
majority of its most-traded counterparts after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress inflation has moved
higher, boosting speculation the central bank won’t take further
steps to support the  U.S. economy .  The greenback erased losses against the euro after Bernanke
said inflation is “higher” and “closer” to the central
bank’s informal target than was the case in August 2010. Gold
reached records in  London  and New York as investors sought
reprieve from volatility. New Zealand’s dollar rose to a record
against the dollar after a larger-than-forecast gain in gross
domestic product.  “Once we saw Bernanke take a step back from a third round
of quantitative easing, stocks gave up all their gains and the
dollar recovered,” said  Brian Dolan , chief strategist at
FOREX.com, a unit of online currency trading firm Gain Capital
in Bedminster,  New Jersey . “It means we’d need to see a couple
more months of erosion in U.S. data and that the Fed’s not going
to rush into additional monetary easing.”  The dollar rose 0.2 percent against the yen to 79.14 at 5
p.m. in New York, from 78.98. It rose 0.2 percent to $1.4143
from $1.4167 versus the euro after earlier falling as much as
0.8 percent. The 17-nation euro was little changed against the
Japanese currency at 111.92, from 111.86.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent after
earlier gaining as much as 0.7 percent.  Gold Demand  Gold rose to a record as the VIX, as the Chicago Board
Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, advanced for the
fourth day, rising 1.8 percent. Gold futures for August delivery
rose 0.2 percent to $1,587.20 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached a record $1,594.90.  The Swiss franc rose as much as 1.2 percent to a record
80.83 centimes per dollar, before trading 0.2 percent higher at
81.60. It surged to a record 1.14945 against the euro, before
trading at 1.15429.  “When you can’t go into the dollar or euro, you go to the
Swiss franc and gold and that’s why you’re seeing record highs
on this near daily basis,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market
analyst in Washington at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a
currency brokerage. “If you listen to Bernanke today, there
isn’t really any near-term chance to see a QE3 and that has
helped the dollar.”  Kiwi, Rand  New Zealand ’s currency rose 0.6 percent to 84.21 U.S. cents
after reaching 85.07 U.S. cents, the strongest since it was
freely floated in 1985.  New Zealand’s economy expanded 0.8 percent in the three
months ended March 31 from the previous quarter, the government
statistics agency said in Wellington. The central bank forecast
growth of 0.3 percent.  “New Zealand is wildly outperforming on stronger than
expected GDP after all the natural disasters there,” said
 Camilla Sutton , a Bank of Nova Scotia currency strategist in
Toronto.  South Africa ’s rand fell to its lowest level in more than a
week against the euro and declined versus the dollar on concern
strikes by steel, engineering and energy workers will slow
growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The rand slipped as much as 1.6 percent to 9.7801 per euro,
the weakest level since July 5. South Africa’s currency
retreated 0.6 percent against the dollar to 6.8372.  Bernanke testified before the Senate Banking Committee
today, after appearing before the House Financial Services
Committee yesterday. The Fed is prepared to take additional
action if the economy appears to be in danger of stalling, he
said yesterday.  U.S. retailers stagnated in June, increasing 0.1 percent,
according to the Commerce Department in  Washington  today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
