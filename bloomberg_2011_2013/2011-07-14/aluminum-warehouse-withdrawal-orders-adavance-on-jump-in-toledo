Orders to draw aluminum from
warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange advanced for
the first time in nine days on a jump in Toledo,  Ohio .  The orders, known as canceled warrants, rose 2,550 metric
tons to 384,550 tons, exchange data showed today. The bookings
at Toledo jumped 10,125 tons. Warehouses in the port city,
located about 50 miles south of Detroit, store 75,475 tons of
aluminum.  Aluminum inventories tracked by the LME extended declines,
driven by drops in the U.S., U.K. and  Singapore . Stockpiles fell
7,900 tons to 4.41 million tons, the lowest level since Jan. 12.
Inventories have retreated 6.3 percent since May 24.  Zinc stockpiles fell 250 tons to 893,975 tons. Canceled
warrants declined 2,125 tons to 40,675 tons. They climbed to
this year’s high of 54,025 tons on July 5.  “It appears that the LME warehouse stocks have merely been
reshuffled, as the last week saw some huge inflows,” Citigroup
Inc. analysts including  David Thurtell  in Singapore said in a
monthly report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
