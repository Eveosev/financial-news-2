Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
insurance company by market value, plans to become the fifth-
biggest insurer in  Serbia  by 2015.  The Paris-based insurer has invested 20 million euros
($28.4 million) in Serbia so far, including a 2010 purchase of
Credit Agricole Life’s local unit, Antonio Marchitelli, Axa’s
regional chief, said in Belgrade today.  “We bet on the region,” he said. “We think it’s very
important that we position ourselves and be ready for future
development, which will be strong.” He declined to disclose
gross premium targets.  Gross premiums rose 5.6 percent last year to 56.5 billion
dinars ($780 million). The Serbian market dominated by  Dunav
Osiguranje AD (DNOS) ,  DDOR Novi Sad AD and Delta Osiguranje AD, a unit
of  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) , Italy’s largest insurance
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
