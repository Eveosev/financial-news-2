Brent futures in  London  are poised
to settle at a record premium to U.S. crude as prices in New
York dropped after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the Fed isn’t planning more bond-buying to stimulate economic
growth.  The difference between the oil futures contracts traded on
London’s ICE Futures Europe Exchange and the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  widened to $23.55 a barrel in intraday trading today,
above an all-time-high $22.29 a barrel based on settlement
prices on June 15. The spread touched $23.32 in intraday trading
that day.  Brent was $22.60 a barrel more expensive than New York
futures on West Texas Intermediate oil at 2:43 p.m., based on
prices on ICE and the Nymex, $1.87 a barrel more than yesterday.  The Brent-WTI spread may widen to $40 a barrel or more
between now and the middle of 2012,  Edward Morse , head of
commodities research at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said in a
report on July 6.  Crude for August delivery dropped $2.36, or 2.4 percent, to
settle at  $95.69 a barrel in New York. Brent oil for August
settlement declined 46 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $118.32 a
barrel on the ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
