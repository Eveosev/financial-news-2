The  European Patent Office  said a
Novozymes A/S patent is invalid, siding with DuPont Co.’s
Danisco A/S unit in the latest legal spat between the world’s
two largest makers of enzymes.  The EPO revoked the patent, which covers the technology
used to coat an enzyme used for  animal feed , according to a
 statement  on the Munich-based agency’s website dated July 8.
Novozymes, which was awarded the patent in 2009, last month won
an injunction against one of Danisco’s products in a Dutch court
based on the EPO’s patent.  “Danisco has strongly maintained that the patent is
invalid and that Danisco’s products do not infringe,” Soonhee
Jang, Danisco’s chief intellectual property counsel, said in an
e-mail. “We are gratified and very pleased with this
decision.”  Novozymes has appealed against the office’s decision and
the patent will stand as granted until the EPO’s board decides
on the challenge, said Annegrethe Jakobsen, a spokeswoman for
the Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based company.  “We still have a strong confidence in the validity of the
patent,” Jakobsen said by e-mail today.  The two companies are also locked in a U.S. patent court
case on an enzyme used in biofuel production.  Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont, the third-biggest U.S.
chemical maker, in May won control of Copenhagen-based Danisco
in a $6.36 billion purchase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
