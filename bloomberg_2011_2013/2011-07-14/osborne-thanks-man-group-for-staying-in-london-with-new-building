Man Group Plc (EMG)  opened a new
headquarters in London with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne thanking the company for staying in the U.K. after
politicians said higher taxes and increased regulation would
prompt hedge funds to flee.  The new building along the  River Thames  is less than a half
mile from Man Group’s old one and has views of  London Bridge ,
the Tower of London and Southwark Cathedral. Man Group, the
world’s largest hedge fund with more than $70 billion under
management, traces its London roots back more than 225 years.
The 10-story headquarters, built at a cost of 250 million pounds
($403 million), will house 957 employees.  Osborne, speaking at a ceremony in London today, thanked
the company for its “decision to commit to the future” of the
U.K. To keep other businesses in London and entice more firms to
move to the city, “we’ve got to get the regulation right and
we’ve got to keep our taxes competitive,” he said.  London Mayor  Boris Johnson  predicted in 2009 that hedge-
fund rules under consideration by the European Union and a plan
by the U.K. to impose a 50 percent income tax on high earners
would cost the city jobs. The regulations have since been
watered down, which Osborne partly attributed to U.K. lobbying.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
