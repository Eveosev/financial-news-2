Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA, the largest shareholder in  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , asked a
Bilbao court to annul the power company’s limits on
shareholders’ voting rights, Cinco Dias said, without saying how
it obtained the information.  Spain ’s Supreme Court has also agreed to hear Iberdrola’s
request that it suspend a law banning such voting restrictions
which came into force this year as the power company seeks to
fend off ACS, the newspaper said.  ACS, which controls 19 percent of Iberdrola’s shares, has
so far failed to force Iberdrola chairman Ignacio Galan to grant
it a seat on the company’s board, the newspaper added.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
