Japan ’s banking lobby said continued
yen appreciation will adversely affect the economy, as the
currency hovered close to a four-month high against the dollar.  “The strong yen has been the chronic issue that affects
Japanese businesses the most,” Katsunori Nagayasu, head of the
Japanese Bankers Association, told reporters today in  Tokyo .  Nagayasu said the currency’s gains stem from the European
sovereign debt crisis and the risk of a third round of
quantitative easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The yen traded
at 79.07 per dollar at 5:16 p.m. in Tokyo, after reaching 78.47,
the highest since March 17.  Japan is beginning to recover from a record earthquake in
March, with industrial production rebounding and companies
stepping up capital spending plans. A stronger yen can erode
exporters’ profits and make Japanese goods more expensive abroad.  Nagayasu, who is also chief executive officer of  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , said the European crisis is unlikely
to have a direct effect on Japanese lenders because their
holdings of assets from the region are limited.  “But it’s having an indirect impact because it’s one of the
reasons behind the yen’s gains,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
