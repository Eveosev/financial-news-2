Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian
unit said protesters from four communities in the country’s
southern delta besieged the company’s Kolo Creek logistics base
and “tampered” with installations.  The protesters from Imiringi, Elebele, Otuasega and Oruma
villages adjoining the base are unhappy “about not being
supplied with electricity from company facilities,” Tony Okonedo, a Shell spokesman in Nigeria, said today in an e-mailed
statement. Led by youths, they “have tampered with our
installations in such a manner that poses serious threat to
people and the environment,” Okonedo said.  The company has informed the Bayelsa state government,
which has jurisdiction over the area, and is seeking dialogue
with the protesters, according to the statement. Shell operates
a joint venture in which it holds a 30 percent stake, with the
state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. holding 55
percent.  Total SA (FP)  owns 10 percent and  Eni SpA (ENI)  5 percent.  Oil companies  operating in Africa’s top-producing nation
often face disruptions from restive communities in southern
Niger River delta that seek more benefits from the industry.
Attacks by armed groups in the region cut more than 28 percent
of Nigeria’s oil output between 2006 and 2006, only subsiding
after thousands of fighters accepted a government amnesty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
