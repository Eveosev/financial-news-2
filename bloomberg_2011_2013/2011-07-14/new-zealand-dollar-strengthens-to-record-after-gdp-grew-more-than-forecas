New Zealand ’s dollar strengthened to
a record versus its U.S. counterpart after the economy grew at a
faster pace than central bank had forecast, signaling the nation
is recovering from a deadly earthquake in February.  The currency, nicknamed the kiwi, advanced against all of
its 16 most-traded peers after the increase in gross domestic
product boosted speculation the  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will
raise interest rates this year. Australia’s dollar fell versus
the greenback as a report showed expectations for  home prices 
declined.  New Zealand’s data “showed the economy probably had more
momentum in it than possibly expected around the time of the
earthquake,” said Grant Turley, a senior currency strategist in
Sydney at  Australia  & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
Australia’s third largest lender by market value. “It’s going
to be another positive for the kiwi.”  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.8 percent to 84.38 U.S. cents
at 11:40 a.m. in Sydney, from 83.74 yesterday. It reached 85.07
cents, the strongest level since it was freely floated in 1985.
The currency gained 1.1 percent to 66.84 yen, from 66.14.  Australia’s dollar dropped 0.2 percent to $1.0735, from
$1.0758, after advancing earlier to $1.0802, the highest level
since May 11. The Aussie was little changed at 85.02 yen.  New Zealand’s economy expanded 0.8 percent in the three
months ended March 31 from the previous quarter, the government
statistics agency said in Wellington. The central bank forecast
growth of 0.3 percent.  Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard said last month the pace
and timing of increases in  interest rates  will be guided by the
speed of the recovery.  Australian home prices fell 2 percent in the second quarter
and rental growth slowed to 1.3 percent, according to a National
Australia Bank Ltd. survey released today. Prices are expected
to decline 1.4 percent over the next year, compared with growth
of 0.5 percent predicted in the bank’s March quarter survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
