Brazilian state-controlled
telecommunications company  Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA (TELB4)  may
be profitable from 2013, a year earlier than previously
forecast, Chief Executive Officer Caio Bonilha said.  The company made “reasonable” economies by contracting
equipment for the country’s broadband Internet plan and should
break even in two years, Bonilha said in a July 11 interview in
Brasilia. Former CEO Rogerio Santanna said Telebras, as the
Brasilia-based company is known, would have profits by 2014.  The Brazilian government has allocated 350 million reais
($222 million) for investments in broadband infrastructure in
the country’s Southeast and Northeast regions. The company
requested 1 billion reais for the year. Bonilha, who took office
in June, said he will ask for a further 250 million reais this
year.  “We’re accelerating the process of implementing the
network and depending on our ability to make the investment, we
could get more resources,” he said. “It’s a commitment of the
government as a whole.”  Telebras has signed contracts to hire infrastructure
equipment and service at 269 million reais, Bonilha said.  The company fell 7 percent to 6.25 reais at the market
close in  Sao Paulo  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
