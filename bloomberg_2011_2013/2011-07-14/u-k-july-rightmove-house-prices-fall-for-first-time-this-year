 U.K. home sellers lowered asking
prices in July for the first time this year as a mortgage
squeeze deterred buyers, Rightmove Plc said.  Asking prices dropped 1.6 percent from the previous month,
when they had gained 0.6 percent, the U.K.’s biggest property
website said in an e-mailed statement today. Seven out of 10
properties listed in 2011 are still available for sale, which
Rightmove described as a “sobering reflection” of the market.  “We expect further falls over the next few months as buyer
momentum ebbs away due to a combination of seasonal factors and
a continuing lack of both mortgage finance and buyer
confidence,”  Miles Shipside , commercial director of Rightmove,
said in the statement.  Values are up 0.1 percent from a year earlier to an average
236,597 pounds ($382,000). The monthly decline is the first
since December, when asking prices fell 3 percent.  Seven of 10 regions tracked by Rightmove showed declines in
July from June, led by a 3.5 percent drop in East Anglia. Asking
prices in  London  fell 1.4 percent to an average 432,641 pounds,
though they are still up 2.5 percent on the year.  The capital “is a less price-sensitive location than other
parts of the country,” Shipside said. Nevertheless, “many of
its buyers still require finances and so are also susceptible to
the tightening of mortgage lending, pressure on income and the
rising cost of living.”  U.K. mortgage approvals have stayed below 51,000 in every
month since the end of 2009, compared with 128,512 at the end of
2006, before the onset of the global credit squeeze,  Bank of
England  data show. Banks approved 45,940 home loans in May.  The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at a
record low of 0.5 percent this month to support the economic
recovery through the biggest fiscal squeeze since World War II.
