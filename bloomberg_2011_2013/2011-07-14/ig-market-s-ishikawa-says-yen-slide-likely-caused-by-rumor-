Kazuo Kitazawa, director of fixed
income at Credit Suisse Group AG in  Tokyo , comments on the
outlook for the yen after Japanese authorities intervened to
weaken the currency today.  The yen declined 1.7 percent to 78.38 per dollar as of
10:25 a.m. in Tokyo.  “For the near term, the yen will continue to weaken.  “Intervention will be more effective if it comes with
monetary easing.  “I can’t say intervention is successful until the yen
depreciates beyond 80 against the dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
