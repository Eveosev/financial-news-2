Elia System Operator NV,  Europe â€™s
fourth largest electric-grid operator, is investing in a $5.5
billion power transmission project off the U.S. Atlantic coast
that will link 6,000 megawatts of offshore wind farms.  The undersea power lines off the coasts of New Jersey, 
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia will be developed in five
segments, Brussels-based Elia said today in a statement. The
company acquired a 10 percent stake in the first segment and 5
percent of the remaining segments, without saying how much it
invested.  Tokyo-based trading company  Marubeni Corp. (8002)  and Zug,
Switzerland-based clean energy investor Good Energies are also
backing the project, and Google Inc. is providing 42 percent of
the pre-construction equity.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in May granted a
12.6 percent return on equity for the project, less than the
13.6 percent sought by the developers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
