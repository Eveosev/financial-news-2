Sports Direct International Plc (SPD) , the
U.K.’s biggest sporting goods retailer, said it expects to meet
its 2012 target for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization of 215 million pounds ($347 million).  It set a target of 250 million pounds of ebitda for fiscal
2013, excluding the costs of an employee bonus plan and other
one-time costs, the Mansfield, England-based company said today
in a statement. Full-year profit fell 5.8 percent as the company
reported accounting adjustments for foreign-exchange hedges.  In March 2010, Sports Direct ran its first television
commercials which helped U.K. retail sales gain 11 percent to
1.25 billion pounds. The company aims to have a presence in 17
European Union countries in five years, Chief Executive Officer
Dave Forsey told reporters. It is currently in eight EU nations.  “We’re trading well in a difficult market,” said Forsey
on a conference call.  Sports Direct fell 7.9 pence, or 3.1 percent, to 250.1
pence at 8:44 a.m. in  London . The shares have risen 56 percent
so far this year, giving the company a market value of 1.4
billion pounds.  Net income was 84.2 million pounds, or 13.93 pence per
share in the year ended April 24, down from 89.4 million pounds,
or 14.76 pence per share, in the same period a year earlier,
Sales gained 10.2 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.  Sports Direct cut net debt by 52 percent, to 148.9 million
