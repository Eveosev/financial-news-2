LS Industrial Systems Co. will build
at least seven substations in  Syria  costing 1.5 billion Syrian
pounds ($31.6 million) to help reduce power cuts and losses in
the national grid, Al-Watan newspaper reported.  The company,  South Korea ’s biggest supplier of power-
transmission components, will build the facilities in six areas
including two in the capital Damascus, the newspaper said,
citing Mohammad Abdel Wahhab Hassan, general manager of the
state-owned Public Establishment for Distribution and
Exploitation of Electrical Energy.  Syria passed an energy law on Nov. 14 allowing foreign and
private local investors to generate and distribute electricity
in the country. The legislation is awaiting executive approval
to come into effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
