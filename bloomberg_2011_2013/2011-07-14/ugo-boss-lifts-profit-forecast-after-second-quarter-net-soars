Hugo Boss AG (BOS)  raised its full-year
earnings outlook after the German luxury clothing company
reported a more than five-fold jump in second-quarter profit.  Hugo Boss now forecasts an increase in 2011 sales of 15 to
17 percent after adjustments for currency effects, compared with
a previous forecast of at least 12 percent, it said in a
statement today. Earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, before special items, are seen rising
25 to 30 percent, compared with an earlier forecast of at least
15 percent.  “This positive development was due primarily to the store
sales growth in the group’s own retail business and the
expansion of the group’s own retail activities,” Metzingen,
Germany-based  Hugo Boss  said. “The most significant increase in
sales was posted in  China  and in the U.S. market.”  China, where demand for expensive men’s wear is rising,
will probably become Hugo Boss’s third-largest market this year,
overtaking France and the U.K. while still lagging behind
 Germany  and the U.S., Chief Financial Officer Mark Langer said
last month. Hugo Boss’s second-quarter net income jumped to 31
million euros ($44 million) from 6 million euros after sales
advanced to 405 million euros from 325 million euros, it said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
