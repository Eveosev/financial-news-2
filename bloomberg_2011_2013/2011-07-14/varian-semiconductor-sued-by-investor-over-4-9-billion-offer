Varian Semiconductor Equipment
Associates Inc. (VSEA)  was sued in federal court by an investor who
says stockholders will be shortchanged in a planned
$4.9 billion, $63-a-share takeover by  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT)   Investor  David Crane  also contends Varian directors
violated U.S. securities law by issuing misleading proxy
materials that failed to fully explain the sales process and why
the board “chose to negotiate exclusively with Applied,”
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Boston.  Shareholders “will be prevented from obtaining a fair
price for their common stock” unless a judge and jury stop the
transaction under its present terms, Crane said in court papers.  Applied, based in Santa Clara, California, agreed May 4 to
buy Gloucester, Massachusetts-based Varian Semiconductor in
anticipation of increased demand for microchip technology used
in mobile devices such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  Bob Halliday, Varian’s chief financial officer, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Varian Semiconductor rose 8 cents to $61.41 at 10:50 a.m.
New York time in Nasdaq stock market trading. The stock has
risen 66 percent this year.  The case is Crane v. Varian Semiconductor, 11CV11236 RGS,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston).  To contact the reporters on this story:
