Ukraine’s grain exports declined to
52,000 metric tons in the first 12 days of July as barley sales
were “sluggish,” UkrAgroConsult said.  Shipments included 12,500 tons of wheat, 12,000 tons of
barley and 27,500 tons of corn, the Kiev-based researcher said
in an e-mailed statement today. It didn’t provide a tonnage for
the the same period last month or a year earlier. Exports were
313,000 tons in the first 20 days of June, the researcher said.  About 120,000 tons of barley is ready to be shipped in the
near future, according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
