(Corrects reference to previous interest margin in
headline, first and second paragraphs of story published July
14.)  EWE AG, a German electricity and gas
supplier, signed an 850 million-euro ($1.2 billion) loan to
refinance an existing credit line.  The five-year revolving facility, with two one-year
extension options, pays initial interest of 40 basis points
more than the benchmark euro interbank offered rate on drawn
funds, arranger  Barclays Capital  said in a statement. The
transaction renews a credit of the same size due to mature in
2013 that paid an initial margin of 15 basis points, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The margin will be linked to a ratings grid, with EWE
paying utilization fees of 15 basis points if more than a third
of the facility is drawn, and 30 basis points if drawn by more
than two-thirds, according to the statement. The Oldenburg,
Germany-based utility is rated A2 by Moodyâ€™s Investors Service.  EWE increased the transaction from 750 million euros
marketed in May after lender commitments exceeded the amount it
sought, according to the statement. Barclays led the deal with
 BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , who were joined by 17
additional banks during syndication. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
