About 1,000 passengers were stranded
overnight at Denver International Airport, the fifth-busiest in
the country, after a hailstorm forced airlines to cancel
flights.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , which has the largest
share of passengers at the airport, canceled 38 departures and
56 arrivals, Laura Coale, an airport spokeswoman, said in a
recorded announcement. Three-quarter-inch hail pelted the
airport just after 9 p.m., Wednesday, damaging about 40 planes,
Coale said.  United, the world’s biggest airline, serves more than 26
percent of Denver, according to data from the  Bureau of
Transportation statistics . Mike Trevino, a United spokesman, did
not know how many of the stranded passengers were from the
carrier’s flights.  “We are currently inspecting aircraft before returning
them to service,” he said.  None of the stranded passengers were from  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  flights, said Marilee McInnis, a spokeswoman for
the Dallas-based carrier. Southwest serves more than 20 percent
of passengers at Denver, the second-largest share.  Three aircraft were damaged in the storm, McInnis said. Two
were pulled from the fleet and the other was repaired and
returned to normal operations. Additional planes were ferried to
Denver to transport passengers Wednesday night and replace the
aircraft undergoing repairs.  No damage was reported to the Denver facilities, Coale
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
