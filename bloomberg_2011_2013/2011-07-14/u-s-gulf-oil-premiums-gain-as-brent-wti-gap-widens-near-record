Crude oil in the U.S. Gulf surged as
the spread between benchmark West Texas Intermediate and its
European counterpart, Brent, widened to a record.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart widened
$1.75 to $22.48 a barrel as of 2:32 p.m. in  New York , after
touching $23.55. The spread settled at a record high of $22.29 a
barrel June 15.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium rose 85 cents to $18.85 a
barrel over WTI as of 2:06 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet slipped 15 cents to
$20.25 a barrel over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained $2.25 to $16 a barrel, while Poseidon increased
$1.90 to $16 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced $1.50 to $13.75 a
barrel, while West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 80
cents. Thunder Horse’s premium added $3.75 to $22.50.  The premium for Syncrude widened 50 cents to $9.50.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 10 cents to
$18.65 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
