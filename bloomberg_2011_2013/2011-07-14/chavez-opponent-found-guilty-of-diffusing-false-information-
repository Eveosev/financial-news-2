A Venezuelan court found an
opposition presidential candidate guilty of falsely claiming
that the South American country has become a center for drugs
trafficking.  Oswaldo Alvarez Paz, the former governor of Zulia state who
plans to take part in primaries to choose a unity candidate to
face President  Hugo Chavez  in elections next year, was sentenced
to two years imprisonment by a Caracas court, according to a
statement from the Attorney General’s office. He was granted a
conditional release and prohibited from leaving the country.  Paz, 68, who also ran for president in 1993, was arrested
in March 2010 after saying on opposition broadcaster Globovision
that  Venezuela  had become a “haven” for drug trafficking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
