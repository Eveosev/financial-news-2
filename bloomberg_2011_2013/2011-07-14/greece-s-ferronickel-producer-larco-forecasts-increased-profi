Larco SA ,  Europe ’s largest
ferronickel producer, forecast higher sales and profit in 2011,
after returning to profit last year, amid greater international
demand for the metal and higher prices.  Larco, which exports all of its production, posted a pretax
profit of 6.4 million euros ($9.1 million) last year, compared
with a pretax loss of 105.5 million euros in 2009, the Athens-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Sales more than doubled to 239.5 million euros, while
production increased 69 percent as the cost to produce nickel 28
percent, according to the statement.  Based on current data, sales in 2011 “will increase
significantly, profit will be higher and production costs will
continue to fall,” the company said.  Greece ’s government plans to sell its 55 percent stake in
Larco during the fourth quarter as part of a program to raise 50
billion euros by the end of 2015 from state asset sales.
 National Bank of Greece SA (ETE)  has a 33.5 percent state in Larco,
while Public Power Corporation SA has an 11.5 percent holding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
