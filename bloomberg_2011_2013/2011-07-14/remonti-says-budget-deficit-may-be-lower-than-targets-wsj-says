Italian Finance Minister  Giulio Tremonti  said Italy’s budget shortfall is likely to be lower
than government targets in 2011 and 2012 because its program of
spending cuts have been speeded up, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an interview.  Italy has “frontloaded both spending cuts and tax revenue
boosters into the first two years of the adjustment plan and as
a result out  budget deficit  will be even lower than our
targets,” Tremonti said, according to the WSJ.  As a result of the acceleration of the government’s fiscal
program, Italy’s deficit-to GDP ratio will trend lower than
expected, the WSJ said, citing Tremonti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
