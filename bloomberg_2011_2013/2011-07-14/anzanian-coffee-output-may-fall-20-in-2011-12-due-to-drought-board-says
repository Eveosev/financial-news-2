Coffee production in Tanzania,
 Africa ’s fourth-largest producer, may fall 20 percent in the
year through June 2012 after a drought stunted growth, the
country’s Coffee Board said.  Output may decline to 45,000 metric tons from 56,247 tons
in the 2010-11 season, Adolph Kumburu, the board’s director
general, said today in an e-mailed report from Moshi, in
northern Tanzania.  The East African country, which largely relies on rain for
its agriculture, was hit by drought in the second half of 2010
and in the first six months of this year, according to the
board.  The forecast crop decline comes after production recovered
last year from 35,700 tons in 2009-10, the board says.
Production in 2009-10 had slumped from 68,000 tons a year
earlier after a previous drought affected all growing regions,
according to the agency.  Tanzania , which consumes less than 3 percent of its annual
output, reaps the crop from April through August, while its
marketing season runs July to April or May.  The country is increasing planting in an effort to raise
output to 100,000 tons by 2015, Kumburu said in February.  Tanzania grows both the robusta and arabica varieties in
the western Kagera region, while the northern Kilimanjaro and
southern regions mainly produce arabica. Arabica accounts for
about 75 percent of output, with robusta making up the rest.  Tanzania trails Ethiopia, Uganda and the  Ivory Coast  among
the continent’s coffee producers, according to the  International
Coffee Organization .  To contact the reporter on this story:
