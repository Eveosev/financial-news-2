Shaun Cochran, head of  Korea 
research at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, comments on the Bank of
Korea’s decision to keep  interest rates  unchanged. He spoke in
an interview with Bloomberg Television from  Seoul  today.  The central bank kept its seven-day repurchase rate at 3.25
percent after raising it in June. The decision was predicted by
13 of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. It raised rates
by a quarter-percentage point each in January, March and June.  On today’s decision:  “If we look at what’s happening in markets, there’s
obviously a clear amount of risk, particularly around sovereign
debt. So it would be a very brave call for the BOK to make a
move right now.  “We also have slowing leading indicators, particularly in
the U.S., and that’s a risk for the growth outlook. So overall,
in the short term, the risks are probably marginally to the
downside relative to expectations, and it’s prudent.  On future rate increases:  “I think there’s actually room for disappointment there.
It will really depend on how the global markets cope with the
sovereign issues that are going on right now, and the pace of
global growth.  “We can be relatively confident on the Chinese front. The
risks for the global economy are obviously coming out of  Europe 
and what the sustainability of U.S. growth is right now. Given
there’s marginal risk for disappointment, it would not surprise
me if we don’t get two rate hikes this year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
