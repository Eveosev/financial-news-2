The koruna slid to its weakest this
month against the euro after Moody’s Investors Service said the
U.S. may lose its Aaa debt rating, driving investors from risk.  The Czech currency depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to
24.483 per euro, its weakest intraday rate since June 27, and
traded down 0.4 percent at 24.456 as of 5:20 a.m. in Prague.  Equities fell in  Europe  and Asia,  U.S. Treasuries  retreated
and gold rose to a record high after Moody’s began a U.S. review
as talks to raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit stall. Italy
sold 1.25 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of five-year bonds at the
highest yield in three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
