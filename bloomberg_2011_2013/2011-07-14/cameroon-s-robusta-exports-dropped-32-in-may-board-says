Robusta coffee exports from Cameroon
fell 32 percent in May compared with a year earlier,
the Cocoa and Coffee Board said yesterday.  A total of 3,830 metric tons of beans were exported, down
from 5,661 tons in May 2010, the board said in an e-mailed
report from the port city of Douala.  The central African nation has exported 21,873 tons since
the season started in December compared with 19,869 tons during
the same period last year, according to the report.  The average export price was 1,088  CFA francs  ($2.37) a
kilogram (2.2 pounds) according to Bloomberg calculations from
the Cocoa and Coffee Board’s daily price publication.  Total production for 2010 was 53,000 metric tons,
representing 94 percent of the country’s total coffee
production, Michael Ndoping, the board’s general manager said in
a press statement Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
