German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  met
with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in Abuja today, with
the two leaders agreeing to expand bilateral cooperation,
particularly on energy.  “I have decided that we further intensify relations
between  Nigeria  and Germany,” Merkel said in remarks broadcast
by state-owned television NTA. “Energy partnership will no
doubt constitute a very important area for that intensified
cooperation.”  Both countries have decided to work together “and agree on
almost all the issues,” Jonathan said in his own remarks.  Trade between Germany,  Europe ’s biggest economy, and
Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer and most populous country,
reached 2.5 billion euros (3.5 billion) in 2010, according to
the German-Nigerian Business Association. While Nigeria’s main
export is crude oil, imports from  Germany  include machinery and
other industrial goods.  The two leaders agreed to set up a bi-national commission
“to oversee the expansion of economic cooperation,” the
Nigerian presidency said today in an e-mailed statement.  Merkel also met with Victor Gbeho, president of the
 Economic Community of West African States , in Abuja to discuss
German cooperation with the regional body.  To contact the reporter on this story:
