European and Asian stocks fell after
Moody’s Investors Service said the American government may lose
the Aaa credit rating it’s held since 1917. U.S. index futures
were little changed.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the U.K.-based oilfield services and
engineering provider, declined 2.3 percent as Barclays Plc
advised selling the shares.  Accor SA (AC)  slid 1.5 percent as rival
Marriott International Inc. forecast earnings that fell below
analysts’ estimates for its per-share profit.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 0.9 percent to 267.59 at
8:03 a.m. in London. Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index expiring in September fell less than 0.1 percent to
