Nisshin Steel Co.,  Japan ’s third-
largest stainless steel maker, and Nippon Metal Industry Co.
surged in Tokyo trading after Japan Metal Bulletin reported that
they are merging to compete with global rivals.  Shares of Nisshin Steel rose 5.2 percent to 162 yen as of
the 11 a.m. trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
biggest gain since May 31. Nippon Metal Industry gained 13
percent to 105 yen, the most since March 16.  Nothing has been decided on the reported merger, Nisshin
Steel said today in a statement in response to the Japan Metal
Bulletin report that the companies may make announcement on a
merger soon. Nippon Metal Industries isn’t in talks with Nisshin
Steel to combine operations, Isao Fujiwara, deputy manager at
the company’s corporate planning department, said by telephone
today, denying the report.  Nisshin Steel is the largest shareholder of Nippon Metal,
holding a 5.12 percent stake as of March 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The proposed merger of  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  and  Sumitomo
Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)  this year has fueled speculation of an
industry consolidation. Japan’s biggest and third-largest
steelmakers, respectively, plan to combine by October 2012 to
create the world’s second-largest producer of the metal after
losing market share to Chinese and South Korean rivals.  Japanese stainless steel makers must consolidate to beat
global competition, Nisshin Steel Chairman Hideo Suzuki said in
February.  To contact the reporters on this story:
