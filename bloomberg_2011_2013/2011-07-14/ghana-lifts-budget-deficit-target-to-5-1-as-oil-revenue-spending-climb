Ghana,  Africa ’s newest oil exporter,
raised its budget deficit target to 5.1 percent of gross
domestic product for 2011 as higher crude earnings allow the
government to boost spending.  The shortfall compares with a previous target of 4.1
percent, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  told lawmakers in the
capital, Accra, today. The fiscal gap will narrow from 6.5
percent of GDP in 2010 as oil earnings help to boost revenue.  The economy will grow 14.4 percent this year, the fastest
in Africa, after oil production began in December, Duffuor said.
The supplementary budget boosts  government spending  by 1.5
billion cedis ($989 million) to help build roads, schools and
modernize farm production, he said.  “In spite of the need for more fiscal space resulting in
the increase in the fiscal deficit target for 2011, government
is mindful of the importance of fiscal and debt
sustainability,” Duffuor said.  The revenue target was raised by 1.37 billion cedis to 12
billion cedis for this year because of higher-than-projected oil
earnings, the minister said. The supplementary budget assumes an
oil price of $100 a barrel, up from $70 previously, resulting in
estimated crude revenue of 1.3 billion cedis, he said. Oil
production is expected to reach 84,737 barrels a day.  Oil Revenue  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , operator of the Jubilee offshore oil field,
expects daily production to 120,000 barrels per day by next
month or September from 80,000 barrels per day at the start of
July. The  Finance Ministry  last year projected oil revenue of
584 million cedis for 2011. About half of that will be channeled
to the state-run Ghana National Petroleum Corp.  “Although spending will of course increase by 1.5 billion
cedis, investors are nonetheless likely to be comforted by
projections for the full year deficit outcome,”  Razia Khan ,
head of Africa economic research at Standard Chartered Plc in
 London , said in an e-mailed note. “Any promise to achieve even
faster fiscal consolidation may not have been entirely credible
given the likely spending pressures ahead of the 2012
election.”  The cedi gained less than 0.1 percent to 1.5160 per dollar
by 7 p.m. in Accra. The yield on  Ghana ’s $750 million Eurobonds,
due 2017, rose for the third day in four to 6.12 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
