Oil traded near a four-day high in
 New York  after signs of shrinking crude supplies in the U.S.
countered speculation the world’s biggest consumer of the
commodity may face a credit-rating downgrade.  Futures swung between gains and losses after Moody’s
Investors Service put the U.S. rating under review as talks to
raise its $14.3 trillion debt limit stall. The Energy Department
said yesterday that oil stockpiles fell for a sixth week and
gasoline supplies dropped.  “It’s a worry, this downgrade,” said  Anthony Nunan , an
assistant general manager for risk management at Mitsubishi
Corp. in  Tokyo . “That’s a scary thing, the uncertainty this is
creating in the market.”  Crude for August delivery was at $98.16 a barrel, up 11
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:22 p.m. Singapore time. The contract yesterday rose 62
cents to $98.05, the highest close since July 7. Prices are 27
percent higher the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement was at $118.34 a barrel,
down 44 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of $20.18 a
barrel to U.S. futures, compared with a record close of $22.29
on June 15.  Monetary Easing  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the
central bank has more tools for monetary easing should the
economy weaken and stymie efforts to generate jobs for 14.1
million unemployed Americans.  The Fed could pledge to keep the main interest rate at a
record low and hold its balance sheet at $2.87 trillion for a
longer period, Bernanke said yesterday in congressional
testimony. It could also buy more bonds, increase the average
maturity of its securities holdings or cut the interest rate it
pays banks on their reserves, he said.  “If the Fed has the power to do this on its own, people
would come back into the oil market and buy it up,” said
Mitsubishi’s Nunan.  Investors tend to buy dollar-denominated commodities when
the currency weakens.  Gasoline Demand  U.S. crude stockpiles declined 3.1 million barrels last
week to 355.5 million, the Energy Department report showed. They
were projected to drop 1.5 million barrels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. The industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  said in a separate report on July 12 that inventories
rose 2.34 million barrels.  The country’s gasoline demand slumped 293,000 barrels last
week to 9.02 million barrels a day, the Energy Department said.
That’s the lowest since the week of May 6. Overall U.S. oil
consumption averaged 18.9 million barrels daily in the period to
July 8, down 1.4 percent from the same time a year ago.  Gasoline supplies fell 840,000 barrels to 211.7 million
last week, the report showed. A 500,000-barrel gain was
projected, according to the survey. Distillate inventories, a
category which includes heating oil and diesel, rose 2.97
million barrels to 145 million, compared with a median forecast
for a 500,000-barrel increase.  Refinery utilization fell to 88 percent last week from 88.4
percent, the Energy Department report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
