F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM) , which
oversees the U.K.’s oldest investment fund, may face costs of as
much as 12.3 million pounds ($20 million) after losing a High
Court ruling.  F&C may be forced to buy Anthony Culligan and Francois Barthelemy’s stake in F&C Partners LLP, a fund of  hedge funds ,
for 7.8 million pounds, the London-based asset manager said
today in a statement. The men set up F&C Partners LLP with F&C
in 2004.  The firm may also be liable for Culligan and Barthelemy’s
legal costs, which “are not believed to be in excess of 4.5
million pounds,” according to the statement. F&C has set aside
2.4 million pounds for the case since the dispute began in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
