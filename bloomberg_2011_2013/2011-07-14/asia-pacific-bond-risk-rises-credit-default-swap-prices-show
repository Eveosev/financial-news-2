The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment rose in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 3.5 basis points
to 123 basis points as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc prices show. That’s on track for the highest
level since Sept. 1, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2.5 basis points to 122 as of 8:30
a.m. in Singapore, RBS prices show. That’s the highest since
Sept. 24, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 basis point to 126.5
as of 9:30 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
