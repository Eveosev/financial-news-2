Gasoline slipped after the U.S.’s
credit rating was put on watch for a downgrade, raising
speculation that a slower pace for economic recovery could curb
demand for the fuel.  Futures declined as much as 1.4 percent after Moody’s
Investors Service put the U.S., rated Aaa since 1917, on review
for the first time since 1996. Gasoline use slumped last week to
lowest level at this time of year since 2002. Prices extended
declines as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
indicated the central bank may be slow to enact another round of
measures to stimulate economic growth.  Part of the reason things are stalling is the possibility
of a Moody’s downgrade and the European debt crisis,  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Now I think we need to see signs that
the economic recovery is going to proceed. Demand figures were
tepid at best.”  Gasoline for August delivery fell 3.19 cents, or 1 percent,
to $3.1197 a gallon at 11:46 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures settled yesterday at the highest level since
May 10.  The U.S. was put on review on concern that the $14.3
trillion debt limit won’t be raised in time to prevent a missed
payment of interest or principal on outstanding bonds and notes,
even though the risk remains low, Moody’s said yesterday.  Bernanke Comments  Bernanke said inflation now is “higher” and “closer” to the
central bank’s informal target than was the case in August. He
said in comments today at a Senate Banking Committee hearing the
increase in inflation this year is one reason why the Fed won’t
immediately embark on a third round of bond-buying.  “The Bernanke testimony took a huge step back from the
QE3,” said Mark Anderle, a trader at Truman Arnold Cos., a
wholesaler in Texarkana,  Texas .  Futures gained yesterday after Energy Department data
showed total gasoline supplies fell 840,000 barrels in the week
ended July 8 to 211.7 million barrels. Analysts estimated that
stockpiles of the fuel increased 500,000 barrels, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Crude oil stockpiles shrank 3.12 million
barrels.  Gasoline demand fell 293,000 barrels a day to 9.02 million
barrels during the same period, a two-month low, department data
showed.  Inventories of the fuel increased 0.8 percent on the East
Coast and 0.7 percent in the  Gulf Coast , with stocks in other
U.S. regions decreasing, led by a 2.9 percent drop on the West
Coast.  Regular gasoline at the pump rose 1 cent to $3.655 a gallon
yesterday, the ninth consecutive increase, according to AAA
data.  Heating oil for August delivery fell 0.78 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.0919 a gallon on the exchange. Futures rose as
much as 1.2 percent earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
