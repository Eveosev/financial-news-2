An Icelandic court has told the
former Chief Executive Officer at FL Group hf, Hannes Smarason,
that he can’t claim damages after the state froze his assets
last year.  The Reykjavik District Court said the state didn’t need to
compensate Smarason even though it had no legal grounds for
freezing his assets. Smarason had sought $43,000 in damages,
according to the  ruling  on the court’s website.  A probe into the tax dealings of FL Group, an  investment
company  now named Stodir hf, is continuing, according to the
ruling. Smarason resigned from FL Group in December 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
