The yen erased gains against the
dollar amid speculation  Japan  will act to weaken the currency.  The yen earlier advanced for a fifth day against the dollar,
touching the strongest level in almost four months. Japanese
Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said today it would be
“problematic” if recent one-sided currency movements continue.
That fueled concern Japan will sell yen to halt gains.  “It’s not confirmed intervention at this stage,” said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
Hong Kong. “Clearly the market is nervous as we probe the
lowest levels since March 17 and certainly the jawboning from
officials has stepped up.”  The yen traded at 79.00 per dollar as of 6:48 a.m. in
 London  from 78.98 yesterday in New York. It was as strong as
78.47 earlier today, most since March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
