Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first day in three, dragged down by oil importers’ demand for
the dollar.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy fell as much
as 0.3 percent to 89.85 per dollar and was trading 0.2 percent
or 89.70 lower at 1:55 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi from
yesterday’s close of 89.55.  “The shilling has been weakened by increased demand for
the dollar by oil importers and we expect it to trade within the
89.50 to 90.00 range,” Wilson Mutai, a trader at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Crude oil rose 0.4 percent to $98.44 per barrel in  New York 
today, bringing its 2011 gain to 7.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
