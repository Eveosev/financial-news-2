MetroGas SA (METR) , Argentina’s biggest
natural-gas distributor, plans to swap as much as $250 million
in existing debt for new dollar-denominated bonds as it seeks to
emerge from bankruptcy protection.  The 14-year bonds will have a coupon of 4 percent,
Financial Director Eduardo Villegas Conte said today in a
telephone interview. The company has about $225 million worth in
bonds due in 2014 and about 102 million pesos ($24.8 million) in
additional outstanding debt, he said.  MetroGas filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2010 after
an 11-year government freeze on natural-gas prices pared
revenue.  BG Group Plc (BG/)  and Argentina’s  YPF SA (YPFD)  are the two major
stakeholders in the distributor through holding company
Consorcio Gas Argentino SA.  YPF, which is controlled by Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , in June
announced that it signed a letter with BG to buy its stake in
MetroGas, pending regulatory approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
