Former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi said the government of Silvio Berlusconi must urgently
agree budget cuts with the opposition and pass the bill, Die
 Welt newspaper  reported, citing an interview.  Welt reported Prodi as saying the budget-cut package should
be approved by the  Italy ’s central bank, to give it
“international credibility.” Prodi added that Italy has to
show it has its finances under control, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
