Germany ’s Finance Ministry said it
forecasts a balanced budget by 2014, earlier than previously
projected, after economic growth bolstered the public finances.  Germany forecasts a budget deficit of 41.5 billion euros
($58.7 billion) this year, or 1.5 percent of gross domestic
product, down from 80.5 billion euros in 2010, the ministry said
in a statement in Berlin today. Debt is likely to decline to 71
percent of national output by 2015 from 83.2 percent last year,
it said.  “Germany contributes with this development significantly
to a stabilization of the euro area,” the ministry said.
“Germany remains an anchor of stability in  Europe .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
