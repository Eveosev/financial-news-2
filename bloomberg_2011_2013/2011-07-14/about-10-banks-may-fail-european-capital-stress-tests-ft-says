Results of European bank stress
tests to be released later today may show that about 10 failed
because they had less than the required five percent core tier 1
capital, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The publication of the test results on 91 banks could lead
to a series of distressed debt deals as the disclosure of
previously unpublished information on banksâ€™ credit exposures
could prompt bids for credit portfolios from specialist buyers,
the FT said, citing unnamed investment bankers and restructuring
consultants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
