Hong Kong ’s securities regulator
failed to obtain a trading ban against New York-based hedge fund
Tiger Asia Management LLC based on insider trading allegations.  Judge Jonathan Harris of Hong Kong’s High Court ruled
yesterday the court couldn’t make the order to ban Tiger Asia
and its employees from trading in securities or derivatives in
the city before the  Securities and Futures Commission  proves its
insider trading case in a tribunal or criminal court.  Harris last month refused to freeze HK$38.5 million ($4.9
million) of assets held by Tiger Asia, the hedge-fund firm led
by Bill Hwang, or to rule on the SFC’s insider trading
allegations, saying the court lacked the power to do so. The
SFC, as the regulator is called, argued at a hearing on July 11
that the trading ban should be considered separately.  The regulator will appeal both decisions, it said in a
 statement  yesterday. The SFC said on June 21 that starting civil
proceedings before the market misconduct tribunal would immunize
Tiger Asia and its officers from criminal prosecution.  Tiger Asia, which has specialized in trading equities in
 China ,  Japan  and  South Korea  since its inception, doesn’t have
an office in Hong Kong, and all of its employees are based in
 New York , according to the regulator. Tiger Asia isn’t licensed
by the SFC.  Tiger Asia disclosed in October it had also received a
subpoena from the U.S. regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
