Thailand ’s baht advanced to a 10-
week high after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said policy makers will provide more economic stimulus if needed,
fanning concern the supply of dollars will increase.  The currency rose for a second day after the Bank of
Thailand raised borrowing costs yesterday and signaled further
increases are likely. The Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar
against the currencies of six major trading partners, dropped by
the most since October 2010 yesterday as Moody’s Investors
Service put the U.S. debt rating on review for possible
downgrade for the first time since 1995.  “It’s the dollar weakness which is the major driver of the
markets and Asian currencies benefited from it,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “Further quantitative
easing would lead to more fund inflows into  Asia . The Bank of
Thailand’s hawkish comments also provided support for the
baht.”  The baht climbed 0.6 percent to 30.08 per dollar as of 8:43
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
reached 30.01 earlier, the strongest level since May 5. The
currency will likely trade between 30 and 30.20 for the rest of
this month, Shiroki said.  ‘Borrowing Cost Uptrend’  The Bank of Thailand lifted the one-day bond repurchase
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 percent
yesterday, its fifth increase this year. Pay rises and spending
pledges by incoming leader Yingluck Shinawatra may fuel price
pressures, the central bank said after the decision. Borrowing
costs remain on an uptrend, Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said.  Consumer prices gained 4.06 percent in June from a year
earlier, following a 4.19 percent increase in May that was the
biggest since September 2008, government data on July 1 showed.  The yield on the 5.25 percent bonds due May 2014 gained
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.88 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year onshore
interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to receive a floating
payment, climbed 7.5 basis points to 3.535 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
