Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s South
African unit said that at least 50 of its 230 retail sites in
the country’s Gauteng province have run out of stocks of one or
more grades of fuel after petroleum industry workers went on
strike on July 4 demanding better pay.  “We have not been able to fully recover from a delivery
backlog in Gauteng since many retail sites are experiencing
considerably higher sales,” Shell said in an e-mailed statement
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
