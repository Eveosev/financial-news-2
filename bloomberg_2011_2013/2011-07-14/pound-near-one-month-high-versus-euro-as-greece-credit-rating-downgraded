U.K.  government bonds  advanced
relative to their euro-area counterparts after  Greece ’s credit
grade was cut three levels by  Fitch Ratings , stoking demand for
the securities as a haven.  The extra yield, or spread that investors demand to hold
Italian 10-year bonds instead of similar-maturity gilts
approached a euro-era record as the Mediterranean nation paid
the highest yield in three years at a sale of 2017 bonds. Fitch
cut Greece to CCC from B+ yesterday. Thirty-year securities rose
as the U.K. sold 2 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) of 4.25 percent
2040 debt. U.K. bonds gained this week as reports showed
inflation slowed and jobless claims increased last month.  Gilts “are being supported by the uncertainty in the euro
zone,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in  London . “It’s a
combination of the reduced inflationary pressure and the ongoing
uncertainty.”  The 30-year yield decreased two basis points to 4.16
percent as of 4:23 p.m. in London. The 4.25 percent security
maturing December 2040 gained 0.285, or 2.85 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 101.445. The yield on the 10-year gilt
also fell two basis points, to 3.10 percent, after sliding to
2.93 percent on July 12, the least since October. Two-year
yields were little changed at 0.72 percent.  Bonds Climb  British government bonds have advanced this month as
concern that  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis is spreading to some
of the euro area’s bigger economies fueled demand for the safest
assets, and on speculation that slowing economic growth will
limit the Bank of England’s ability to raise rates as the
 European Central Bank  tightens monetary policy.  Gilts have returned 1.6 percent since the end of June,
compared with a 3.7 percent loss by Italian bonds, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds handed investors a
1.9 percent loss, the indexes show.  U.K. 10-year bonds yielded 254 basis points less than their
Italian counterparts today, up from a 2011 low of 77 basis
points on Feb. 2. The spread widened to 260 basis points on July
11, the most since before the euro’s 1999 debut, based on
closing Bloomberg generic prices.  The pound was little changed at 87.85 pence per euro. It
appreciated on July 12 to 87.49 pence, the strongest level since
June 16, and bought $1.6119, from $1.6107 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
