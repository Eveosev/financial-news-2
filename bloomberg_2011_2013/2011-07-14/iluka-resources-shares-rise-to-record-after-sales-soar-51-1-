Iluka Resources Ltd. (ILU) , the worldâ€™s
biggest zircon producer, climbed to a record after first-half
sales rose 51 percent as mineral sands prices soared.  Iluka gained as much as 6.2 percent to A$17.89 in Sydney
trading. The Perth-based company has advanced 92 percent this
year, driven by supply shortages and higher prices.  Zircon, used in ceramics and chemicals, remains in deficit
as demand in  China  continues to be strong, Iluka said today in a
statement. Customers paid an average price of $1,600 a metric
ton during the second quarter, compared with $1,000 a ton during
the first quarter. Third-quarter prices are expected to gain 35
to 40 percent on second-quarter levels, Iluka said.  First-half mineral sands revenue rose to A$570 million
($614 million) compared with a year earlier. Production rose 17
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
