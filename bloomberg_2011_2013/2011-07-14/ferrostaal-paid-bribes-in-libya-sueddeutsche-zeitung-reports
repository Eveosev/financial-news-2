Ferrostaal AG paid bribes to
officials in  Libya  between 2000 and 2007,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, citing a company investigation conducted by  law firm 
Debevoise & Plimpton LLP.  The law firm found “questionable payments” of 12 million
euros ($17 million) of which at least 2 million were bribes, the
German newspaper said. The probe found a total of 336 million
euros of unclear payments made since 1999, according to
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.  Maria Lahaye-Geusen, a spokeswoman for Ferrostaal in Essen,
 Germany , declined to comment on the law-firm report when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
