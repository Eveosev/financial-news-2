Consol Energy Inc. (CNX) , a coal and
natural gas company, surged after raising its output guidance
amid increased productivity.  Consol rose $2.16, or 4.4 percent, to $50.89 in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 39
percent in the past year.  Pittsburgh-based Consol said in a statement it was
increasing production guidance for the year to between 62
million and 63 million tons from earlier forecasts for 60
million to 62 million.  “They raised guidance at their most important mine, the
Buchanan mine,” said  Jeremy Sussman , an analyst at Brean Murray
Carret & Co. in New York. “That mine produces low-vol met coal,
among the best in the world, and that’s a product that’s in very
tight supply.”  Consol said its Buchanan mine in  Virginia  was productive
during the quarter even as it had a so-called longwall move,
which involves relocating heavy mining machinery to a different
panel in the  coal mine . The company’s Shoemaker operation in
Marshall County,  West Virginia , set production records, it said.  The company said it will extract about 5 million tons of
low-volatility metallurgical coal, up from a previous estimate
of 4.5 million. Inventories for the thermal variety of the fuel,
used by utilities, dropped 0.9 million tons to 1.6 million
during the quarter, it said.  UBS AG raised its 2011 earnings-per-share estimate for
Consol as a result of the revised guidance. The company is
expected to earn $3.43 a share, up from the previous estimate by
UBS analyst Shneur Gershuni of $3.32.  To contact the reporter on this story:
