Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened the
most in seven weeks after Moody’s Investors Service put the U.S.
debt rating on review for possible downgrade, curbing demand for
dollars.  The greenback also declined against all 16 major currencies
on concern the supply of dollars will increase after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress yesterday the
central bank is prepared to take additional action, including
buying more  government bonds , if the economy appears to be in
danger of stalling. Moody’s put its Aaa rating for the U.S. on
review for the first time since 1995.  “Bernanke’s promise of further policy support boosted
Asian currencies,” said Calbert Loh, head of treasury at
Bangkok Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Moody’s possible downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating also weighed on the dollar.”  The ringgit rose 0.7 percent to 3.0035 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  exchange rate  has averaged 3.03 so far this year
and the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research said today it
expects a figure for the full year of 3.00, strengthening to
2.95 in 2012.  Inflation is likely to have peaked at 3.8 percent in June,
having hit a two-year high of 3.3 percent in May, according to
the research agency. The benchmark interest rate is expected to
be increased by a quarter of a percentage point more both this
year and next from its current level of 3 percent, MIER said,
predicting economic growth of 5.2 percent for 2011 and 5.5
percent for 2012.  Bonds Steady  Bank Negara Malaysia  boosted borrowing costs in May for the
third time since the start of 2010 and said last week it would
consider further normalizing interest rates to safeguard  price
stability  if domestic growth momentum is sustained.  Government bonds were little changed. The yield on the
4.262 percent debt due September 2016 rose one basis point to
3.52 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  The treasury auctioned 4 billion ringgit ($1.32 billion) of
the notes yesterday at an average yield of 3.518 percent,
attracting bids for more than twice the amount of debt offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
