Mauritius’s rupee added the most
against the dollar in almost two weeks on low demand from
importers and after Moody’s Investors Service put the U.S. on
review for a credit downgrade, damping dollar appetite.  The rupee advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 28.30 per
dollar, before trading 0.2 percent up at 28.45 by 2:06 p.m. in
Port Louis, the capital, according to Bloomberg data.  The dollar slipped against 12 of its 16 major peers after
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it would consider buying more
 government bonds  to boost the world’s biggest economy. The rupee
closely tracks the euro’s movements against the dollar, with an
average correlation of 0.89 this month. A value of 1 would mean
they move in lock step.  “Importers aren’t active as they already settled an
important portion of their invoices at the end of last month,
which coincides with the closing of annual accounts for most
local companies,” Fabien Gebert, treasurer at GML, an
investment group that says it’s the country’s biggest by
revenue, said by phone. “There’s also the influence of the
euro-dollar swing.”  Data from the Bank of Mauritius’s website show that buying
prices for dollars ranged from 27.5338 rupees to 27.6983 rupees,
while the average selling level was 28.9963 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
