The world sugar surplus may be 1
million metric tons smaller than estimated in the coming season
because of a supply shortfall in  Brazil , according to the
 International Sugar Organization .  The ISO in May initially predicted production would outpace
demand by more than 3 million tons in the 2011-12 season
starting in October. Sugar output in Brazil’s main producing
region will fall for the first time in six years in the season,
industry group Unica said yesterday. The country is the world’s
largest producer of the sweetener.  “Lower production in Brazil in 2011-12 and a forecast for
reduced output in 2012-13 may lead the surplus to shrink by as
much as 1 million tons,” Leonardo Bichara, a senior economist
at the ISO, said by phone today from  London .  The organization slashed its estimate for total Brazilian
sugar production in 2011-12 to 38.5 million tons from about 40
million tons, Bichara said. Output in the following season will
come to 42 million tons, 2 million tons less than predicted
previously, he said.  “World stocks will continue to be low and prices are
unlikely to fall below 20 cents a pound, which is the cost of
production in Brazil,” he said.  Raw sugar for October delivery was recently down 0.94 cent,
or 3.1 percent, at 29.30 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . At yesterday’s close, prices had climbed 24 percent in
a month on concern production in Brazil would be lower than
first estimated.  The surplus for the current 2010-11 season may still
increase on higher output estimates for  Thailand , the second-
largest sugar exporter, and weaker growth in usage, according to
Bichara.  “Consumption growth is likely to be reduced to 1.5 percent
in 2010-11 from the 2 percent initially forecast,” he said.
“High prices could also dent demand in 2011-12.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
