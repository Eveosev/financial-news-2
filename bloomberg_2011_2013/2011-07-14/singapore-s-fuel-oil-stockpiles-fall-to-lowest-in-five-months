Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell to the lowest in five months, data from a unit
of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, dropped 8.7
percent to 17.5 million barrels in the seven days to July 13
compared with a week earlier,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Stockpiles were at the
lowest since Feb. 16.  Supplies of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, declined 1.3 percent to 15.9 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline increased
2.3 percent to 9.7 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
