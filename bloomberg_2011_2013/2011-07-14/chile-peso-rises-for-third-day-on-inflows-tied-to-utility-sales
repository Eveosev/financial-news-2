Chile ’s peso climbed for a third day
on speculation foreign investors will bring dollars into the
country to participate in the government’s auction tomorrow of
its shares in two  utility companies .  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 462.18 pesos per dollar at
1:01 p.m. New York time, from 462.95 yesterday.  The  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  has said it will
participate in the auction tomorrow that may allow it to
increase its majority positions in two Chilean water utilities.  ”If the fund wins the auction, it will have to inject
about $600 million into Chile, which will be converted into
pesos,” Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredora de
Bolsa, said in a phone interview from Santiago. ”That has a
psychological effect on traders, who are betting that the fund
will win the auction and there will be a large influx of dollars
into the market in the next few days.”  The Ontario fund currently owns 51.1 percent of Essbio SA
and 69.8 per cent of Esval SA. It intends to purchase all of the
shares being offered by CORFO, a Chilean government agency, it
said in a statement July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
