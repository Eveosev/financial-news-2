Uruguay had its foreign currency
issuer default rating raised to BB+ from BB by  Fitch Ratings ,
which cited improved external and fiscal solvency ratios. The
rating outlook was revised to stable from positive.  The local currency issuer default rating was raised to BBB-
from BB+ and the country ceiling was upgraded to BBB from BBB-,
Fitch said. Uruguay’s foreign currency short-term issuer default
rating was affirmed at B.  Uruguay now has a better currency composition and maturity
structure of government debt, Fitch said. High gross domestic
product, per capita income, social indicators and “solid”
institutions underpin Uruguay’s creditworthiness, Fitch said.  “Uruguay’s growth performance and outlook remain quite
favorable,” Fitch analysts including Santiago Mosquera said
today in the statement. “Fitch believes policy continuity and
political stability are solidly anchored by a strong
institutional framework.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
