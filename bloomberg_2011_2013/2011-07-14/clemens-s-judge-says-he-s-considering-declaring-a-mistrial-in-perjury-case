The judge in the perjury trial of
former ballplayer  Roger Clemens  said he is considering declaring
a mistrial because jurors saw a video in violation of a court
order.  U.S. District Judge  Reggie Walton  in Washington today said
prosecutors violated an earlier order when they showed the jury
a video clip of the 2008 hearing where the wife of former New
York Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte was discussed. Walton said he
earlier ruled that an affidavit given to Congress by Pettitte’s
wife, Laura, couldn’t be admitted into evidence in the
government’s presentation of its main case.  “I think Mr. Pettitte’s testimony is critical as to whether
this man goes to prison,” Walton said, noting that the video
improperly bolstered Pettitte’s credibility with the jury. “I
don’t see how to unring the bell,” Walton said.  Walton then called a break in the proceedings as he mulled
his next move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
