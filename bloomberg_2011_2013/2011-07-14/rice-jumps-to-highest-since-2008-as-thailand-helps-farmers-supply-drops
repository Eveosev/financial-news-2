Soybeans rose for a ninth session in
 Chicago , the longest streak since August, on speculation hot
weather in the U.S. will reduce yields and curb global
stockpiles. Rice reached the highest price since Oct. 9, 2008.  Almost a third of soybeans in the U.S. Midwest including
Iowa and  Illinois , the biggest growing states, may be hurt by
unusual heat and dryness over the next 15 days after high winds
affected some plants in the states this week, Commodity Weather
Group LLC predicted yesterday. The oilseed has gained 7 percent
since June 30, the last time prices declined.  “Hot, dry weather is expected to prevail across the
Midwest, which could affect crops during the crucial August
growing period, lowering yields,” said Justine White, an
analyst at VM Group in  London .  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 5.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $13.85 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices increased 43 percent in the past
year, partly on rising demand from  China , the biggest importer.
The U.S. is the top grower and exporter.  Rice for September delivery added 24 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $16.93 per 100 pounds after touching $17.07. The grain
climbed on concern higher guaranteed prices for farmers in
 Thailand , the top shipper, will boost export costs as import
demand strengthens.  Rice Guarantee  Indonesia , the third-largest rice consumer, plans to import
for a second year to boost stockpiles 33 percent to 2 million
tons, Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said yesterday. Incoming Thai
leader Yingluck Shinawatra won a July 3 poll partly on a pledge
to raise the guaranteed price for farmers.  The “promise to buy rice at a higher price will likely
drive prices higher,” Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at
Standard Chartered Bank in  Singapore , said by phone today.
Import demand from Indonesia and threats to production in the
U.S. “also add pressure to prices.”  Wheat for September delivery fell 2.75 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.1175 a bushel. The grain climbed 12 percent in
two sessions before today. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris dropped 1.75 euros, or 0.9
percent, to 199.25 euros ($282) a metric ton.  Corn for December delivery gained 3.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.83 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
