Honda Motor Co. said 10 of its North
American plants now send no waste to landfills and four others
in the region cut scrap and trash to “virtually” nothing as
the carmaker seeks to curb manufacturing-related pollution.  Honda, which claimed in 2001 that its Alabama auto-assembly
plant was first in the U.S. to send no trash to landfills, aims
to lead the industry in waste reduction, Ed Miller, a spokesman
for the Tokyo-based carmaker, said in a telephone interview. The
company isn’t aware of a competitor that’s achieved a higher
level, he said.  “We now have 10 of 14 facilities that are absolute zero,
and for the four that still have some there are extenuating
circumstances,” said Miller, who is based in  Detroit .  Those include a lack of recycling options for cafeteria
waste at Honda’s Mexican motorcycle and auto plant, and a
byproduct material from painting aluminum hoods at its Ohio auto
plants that can’t be recycled under U.S. rules, Miller said.  Honda,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, in 2010 built more
than 80 percent of cars and light trucks it sold in the U.S. at
North American plants, the highest proportion among Asian and
European-based companies. Honda’s U.S. headquarters are in
Torrance, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
