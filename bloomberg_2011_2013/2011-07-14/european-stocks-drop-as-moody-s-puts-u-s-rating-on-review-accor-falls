European stocks fell for the fourth
day in five after Moody’s Investors Service said the American
government may lose the Aaa credit rating it’s held since 1917.
Asian shares dropped and U.S. index futures were little changed.  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the U.K.-based oilfield services and
engineering provider, declined 2.7 percent as Barclays Plc
advised selling the shares.  Accor SA (AC)  slid 1 percent as rival
Marriott International Inc. forecast earnings that fell below
analysts’ estimates for its per-share profit.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 0.7 percent to 267.96 at
10:45 a.m. in London. Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index expiring in September rose 0.2 percent to 1,316.8,
while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index retreated 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
