Germany ’s Roman Catholic Church is
expanding its search for pedophile priests back to 1945, probing
diocese records to discover early-warning signs of sexual abuse
and help prevent new cases.  The German Bishops’ Conference has commissioned separate
investigations by a crime researcher and a team of psychiatrists
to compile cases, profile perpetrators and review its guidelines
for prevention, according to a  statement  on the group’s website.  “We want to track down the truth that may be lurking
undiscovered in the records from past decades,” the group
quoted Bishop Stephan Ackermann, the German church’s envoy for
investigation of sex abuse, as saying yesterday in Bonn. “We
want to learn still more, including for prevention.”  A wave of allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests
emerged in Germany last year, beginning at an elite Jesuit high
school in Berlin. The head of the bishops’ conference,
Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, apologized to more than 100
pedophilia victims in February 2010 after German-born Pope Benedict XVI called such abuse a “heinous crime.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
