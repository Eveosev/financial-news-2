Ghana’s cedi appreciated for the
first day in three as investors bought the local currency ahead
of the central bank’s auction of its first five-year bond since
2007.  The cedi appreciated as much as 0.1 percent to 1.5142 per
dollar, before trading less than 0.1 percent up at 1.5158 per
dollar as of 4 p.m. in the capital, Accra.  “Offshore investors sold the  U.S. dollar  today ahead of
the central bank’s bond auction,” Kevin Adarkwa, a currency
trader at the local unit of Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said in
a telephone interview. “Brokerage firms were also doing the
same.”  The  Bank of Ghana  will sell 300 million cedis ($197.9
million) worth of five-year bonds on July 28, the bank said in a
prospectus published on its website on June 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
