(Corrects story from yesterday to say that kidnapped
workers were employees of contractors of Mol in  Pakistan , not
Mol.)  Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest oil
refiner, said one of two kidnapped people working for a supplier
to the company’s Pakistani unit was released by captors.  Suspected Islamic militants kidnapped an engineer and his
driver after attacking a convoy returning from a drilling site
west of Kohat town in northwest Pakistan on Jan. 20. Two workers
and four paramilitary police personnel were killed in the
attack.  Both the engineer, Abul Rashid, and his driver were
released yesterday, local police spokesman Fazal Naeem Khan said
by phone today.  Mol spokesman Johannes Vetter said he could only confirm
that one person had been released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
