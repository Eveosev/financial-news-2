Petroleos Mexicanos ,  Latin America ’s
largest oil producer, said it is taking steps to ensure heavy
rainfall doesn’t affect output at the Salina Cruz refinery.  The Mexico City-based state oil company said its largest
refinery is processing crude under “normal conditions,”
according to a statement on its website  posted  today. The
emergency response plan consists on setting up pumping systems
for rainfall and cleaning external gutters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
