Pick n Pay Stores Ltd. (PIK) ,  South
Africa ’s second-largest grocer, fell the most in more than three
years in Johannesburg trading after reporting a decline in
first-half earnings.  The shares dropped  as much as  6.6 percent, the steepest
intraday slide since March 20, 2009. They were down 6.1 percent
at 44 rand as of 2:23 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Per-share earnings fell by as much as 10 percent in the six
months through August, while per-share earnings from continuing
operations slid by between 25 percent and 35 percent, Cape Town-
based Pick n Pay said in a stock exchange filing today. Sales
rose 5.9 percent, while revenue at stores open for at least a
year gained 3.2 percent.  “Lower than expected turnover growth is the result of
increased market competiveness, poor availability of merchandise
from suppliers and continued economic pressure” on customers,
Pick n Pay said. “Although new store growth is still behind the
market, store openings are weighted to the second half of this
financial year and significant work is underway to strengthen
the medium- to longer-term pipeline.”  The company expects to release first-half earnings Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
