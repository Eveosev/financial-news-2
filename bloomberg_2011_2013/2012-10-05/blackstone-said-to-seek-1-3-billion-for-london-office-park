Blackstone Group LP (BX)  is seeking to
sell a west  London  office park for 67 percent more than it paid
for the property 18 months ago, two people with knowledge of the
matter said.  Blackstone, manager of the world’s largest real estate
fund, is offering Chiswick Park for about 800 million pounds
($1.3 billion) and hired  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG)  to sell the property,
the people said. They asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Ken Caplan, Blackstone’s head of
European real estate, declined to comment.  Blackstone bought Chiswick Park Unit Trust, the fund that
owns the property, in April 2011 for 480 million pounds. Since
then, Blackstone cut vacancies at the 33-acre (13-hectare) park
to 1 percent from 9 percent. In November, the company started
work on a 215,000 square-foot (20,000 square-meter) building on
the site that  Aker Solutions  will lease. Other Chiswick Park
tenants include Walt Disney Co., Tullow Oil Plc and Halliburton
Co.  The completion of the building next year will increase the
amount of space at the park to 1.33 million square feet,
excluding consent for an additional 333,000 square-foot office
building, the park’s last site available for development.  Rising Rents  Annual rents at Chiswick Park are, on average, about 45
pounds a square foot, 10 pounds more than when Blackstone
acquired the property, the people said. That reflects a shortage
of large modern or recently refurbished office space in London.  Senior loans of 302.3 million pounds funding the purchase
of Chiswick Park were sold as commercial mortgage-backed
securities in June 2011 in what was  Europe ’s first CMBS sale
since 2007.  “Prepayment on the sale of the asset should not be taken
as a given,” Deutsche Bank AG asset-backed bond analysts said
in a note to investors today.  The purchase was also funded by a 61 million-pound
mezzanine loan, the analysts said. Cash-rich investors, like a
sovereign debt fund, may be deterred by the high leverage, so
“we would therefore expect any sale to encompass the prepayment
of the loan (plus swap)” and additional fees, they said.  Property Week reported the planned sale yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
