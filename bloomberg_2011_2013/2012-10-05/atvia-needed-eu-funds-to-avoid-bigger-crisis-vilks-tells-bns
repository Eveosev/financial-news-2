Latvia ’s  economy , which shrunk by a
quarter in 2008 and 2009, would have contracted by as much as 45
percent without European Union funds, said Finance Minister
Andris Vilks, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  EU  cohesion funds , which help finance transport investment
for member states that have income of less than 90 percent of
the EU average, were equal to about 8 percent to 9 percent of
gross domestic product during the country’s crisis, Vilks said,
BNS reported.  The crisis forced Latvia to seek a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8
billion) loan from the EU and  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
