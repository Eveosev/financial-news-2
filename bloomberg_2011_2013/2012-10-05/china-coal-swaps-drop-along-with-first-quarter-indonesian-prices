Swaps fell for thermal coal delivered
to South  China , according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore Pte.  The swap for coal with a heating value of 5,500
kilocalories a kilogram for shipments to South China in next
year’s first quarter declined 60 cents to $85.15 a ton on a net-
as-received basis yesterday, Ginga said in an e-mail today. The
November contract was 5 cents lower at $82.95 a ton.  Three parcels of October API-8 CFR China swaps for 5,000
tons each were traded at $82.65 a ton, $82.75 and $82.80,
according to Ginga. The energy broker started offering the
contract for API-8 CFR China swaps on its electronic trading
system on June 1.  The contract for sub-bituminous coal with a calorific value
of 4,900 kilocalories a kilogram for loading from  Indonesia  in
the first quarter of 2013 fell 5 cents to $62.55 a metric ton on
a net-as-received basis, the energy broker said. The swap for
November rose 20 cents to $60.60 a ton. Indonesia is the world’s
largest exporter of the fuel for electricity generation.  A commodity swap is a financial agreement whereby a
floating price is exchanged for a fixed rate over a specified
contract period.  About 60 percent of Indonesia’s coal is classified as sub-
bituminous. Higher moisture levels and a lower carbon content
reduce the heating value compared with grades with a better
quality stock. Sub-bit coal has kilocalories of less than 6,100
per kilogram, according to the Indonesian energy ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
