The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.2 percent to 663.71 at 4:16 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.5 percent to 1,621.866.  CRUDE OIL  Oil headed for a third weekly decline in  New York  on
speculation the biggest gain in two months yesterday was
exaggerated amid rising supplies.  Crude for November delivery fell as much as 55 cents to
$91.16 a barrel and was at $91.24 in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:02 p.m. in  Tokyo . The contract
rose $3.57 to $91.71 yesterday. Prices are down 1 percent this
week, for the longest run of weekly declines since June, and 7.7
percent this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  High-sulfur  fuel oil  fell 45 cents to $4.40 a barrel below
Asian marker Dubai crude at 10:12 a.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The discount has
widened 2.8 percent so far this week, after expanding 76 percent
in the previous week. Fuel oil swaps for November were at
$662.25 a metric ton, PVM said. Prices are down 1.2 percent for
the week.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
at $106.70 a ton at 12.28 p.m. Singapore time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a measure of refining
profit, has shrunk 7.8 percent this week. Naphtha swaps for
November were at $949.75 a ton, according to PVM. Prices are set
for a 1.3 percent drop, the second weekly decline in three.  BASE METALS  Copper advanced for a second day, heading for the first
weekly increase in three, on speculation that moves by central
banks around the world to stimulate growth will boost demand for
industrial metals.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold traded near the highest level in almost 11 months on
speculation that central-bank stimulus from the U.S. to  Europe 
and Japan will boost demand for the metal as a store of value.  Spot gold increased as much as 0.3 percent to $1,796.10 an
ounce, the highest intraday level since Nov. 14, and traded at
$1,791.48 as of 3:02 p.m. Singapore time. Platinum gained as
much as 0.7 percent to $1,730.50 an ounce, a level last seen on
Feb. 29, before trading at $1,719.79.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans climbed for a third day as U.S. export sales
jumped, boosted by purchases from  China .  The contract for delivery in November rose as much as 0.5
percent to $15.5875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures were at $15.5375 at 2:10 p.m. Singapore time, trimming
the weekly loss to 3 percent, the third such decline.
Corn for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to $7.5575 a
bushel, while wheat for delivery in the same month was little
changed at $8.69 a bushel.  Rubber retreated from a four-month high, paring a fifth
weekly advance, as  Japan ’s central bank refrained from expanding
stimulus, spurring a rally in the Japanese currency and cutting
the appeal of yen-based contracts.  Rubber for delivery in March lost 0.7 percent to settle at
269.9 yen a kilogram ($3,439 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. The most-active contract climbed earlier to
275.5 yen, the highest level since May 23. Futures advanced 3.6
percent this week, the best such gain since the five-day period
ended Sept. 14 and the longest weekly winning streak since
October 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
