A commission appointed by the Group
of 20 nations to investigate possible manipulation in oil
markets  concluded  today that price reporting agencies should
adopt robust methods and audit trails to ensure the reliability
of derivative contracts based on price assessments.  The International Organization of Securities Commissions
was appointed by the G-20 in November to investigate the role
played by the agencies, including Platts, the energy and pricing
unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., and Argus Media Ltd., in the
functioning of oil markets, their methods of operation and
governance and options for future oversight.  Platts, Argus and ICIS issued a draft self-regulatory code
in April in reaction to an earlier report from IOSCO.  Madrid-based IOSCO brings together national market
regulators from more than 100 countries, including the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to coordinate rules and
share information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
