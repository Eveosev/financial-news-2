Barclays Plc (BARC)  is closing a shipping
unit amid a companywide review of its businesses and slumping
freight rates.  The London-based bank will close Pendle Shipping, it said
in an e-mailed statement today. Five tankers carrying refined
fuels will end their charters with the company, industry
newspaper TradeWinds reported. Jon Laycock, a spokesman for
Barclays, declined to say how many ships the company controlled.  “Barclays confirms it has completed a strategic review of
Pendle Shipping and is looking to exit from the market,” the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. “We continuously
review and evaluate our portfolio businesses so as to maximize
the performance of our overall business.”  Chief Executive Officer  Antony Jenkins , who succeeded
 Robert Diamond  in August following the London interbank offered
rate-rigging scandal, is reviewing which parts of the company
will be sold or shrunk as the bank seeks to boost profitability
and overhaul its culture. Britain’s second-biggest lender paid a
record 290 million-pound ($471 million) fine in June for
manipulating Libor. Daily earnings for product tankers on the
benchmark trade route for oil products tankers dropped 65
percent this year to $7,784, according to the  Baltic Exchange ,
the London-based publisher of shipping costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
