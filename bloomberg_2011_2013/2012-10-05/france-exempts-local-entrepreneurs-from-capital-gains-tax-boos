France  will exempt local business-
owners who qualify as entrepreneurs from a tax increase on
 capital gains  planned in the 2013 budget, a Finance Ministry
official said.  Rules are still being defined on how long a business-owner
must own his company, how much of it he must own and what he’s
allowed to do with the proceeds of a sale to fit the
“entrepreneur” category and continue paying the current 19
percent tax rate in addition to 15.5 percent in social charges.  Owners of French startups have been voicing concerns over
the increase in the budget in the tax on capital gains from
selling a business, which in some cases could be double the
current rate. The tax increase spawned a protest group called
“Les Pigeons,” which drew thousands of supporters on social
network websites such as Facebook Inc. and Twitter.  After meeting with entrepreneurs yesterday, French Finance
Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said he will suggest changes to the
2013 budget to address their concerns, while maintaining the
principle of aligning the tax on revenue from capital and from
labor for other categories of investors.  Moscovici also said the shortfall in revenue for the
government from the change will be compensated elsewhere,
without providing details. French President  Francois Hollande ’s
government has said the 2013 budget will ensure that France
meets its commitment to cut its deficit to 3 percent of gross
domestic product next year from 5.2 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
