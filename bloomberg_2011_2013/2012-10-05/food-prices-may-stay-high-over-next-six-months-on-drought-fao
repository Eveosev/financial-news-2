Global food prices will probably stay
high in the next six months after drought in the U.S. and Russia
cut grain supplies, said the United Nations.  The global market “will switch to a short supply mode”
for the first time in two years, said  Hiroyuki Konuma , the
regional representative for Asia and Pacific at the UN’s Food &
Agriculture Organization. “We will have to monitor it very
cautiously,” he said in a phone interview on Oct. 3.  World food  costs  rose in September to the most expensive in
six months as dairy and meat producers passed on higher feed
prices to users, the FAO said yesterday. An index of 55 food
items rose to 215.8 points in September from 212.8 a month
earlier and compared with a 131.17 average in the past 20 years.
Corn traded in  Chicago  jumped 50 percent since the middle of
June as the worst U.S. drought in half a century killed crops.  Food prices  monitored by the UN may climb 15 percent by
June, surpassing the record set in February 2011, Nick Higgins,
an analyst at Rabobank International, said in a report on Sept.
19. Grain and oilseed prices should “remain at elevated
levels” for at least the next 12 months to ration demand and
encourage crop farmers to boost planting, he said.  “We do not anticipate food prices peaking” or a food
crisis at this stage because crude-oil costs are lower than in
2008 and rice supplies are abundant, Konuma said.  The FAO forecasts world grain production will fall to 2.29
billion metric tons this year from 2.35 billion tons in 2011,
cutting its expectation by 8.8 million tons from a month ago on
lower output of coarse grains, it said yesterday. Dry weather
has hurt crops from the U.S. to  Russia  and  Australia .  Corn for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to $7.5425 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
