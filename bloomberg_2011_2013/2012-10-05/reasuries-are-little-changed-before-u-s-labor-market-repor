Treasury 10-year notes were little
changed, with yields at the highest in more than a week, before
a government report forecast to show the U.S.  jobless rate 
increased and payrolls expanded at a faster pace last month.  U.S. government securities still outperformed German bunds
as a report showed Germany’s factory orders declined more than
economists predicted in August, boosting demand for U.S. assets.
The yield spread between 10-year notes and inflation-linked
bonds was set to complete the second biggest weekly gain this
year as  inflation expectations  rose.  “Overall, the Treasury market will remain well supported
around current levels,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Munich. “We’d need a tremendous
deviation from the consensus expectations to trigger a
meaningful response in the market,” he said, referring to the
forecasts for the unemployment rate and nonfarm payrolls.  The 10-year Treasury note yield added less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 7:24 a.m.
 New York  time, the highest level since Sept. 25. The 1.625
percent security due in August 2022 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 15/32. The rate climbed six basis
points yesterday, the most since Sept. 14.  Labor Data  U.S. unemployment rose to 8.2 percent last month from 8.1
percent in August, according to the  median  projection of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls climbed by 115,000,
less than the 139,000 average over the first eight months of the
year, the report is also forecast to show. The Labor Department
will issue the data at 8:30 a.m. in Washington.  The  Federal Reserve  unveiled a third round of so-called
quantitative easing last month with open-ended purchases of $40
billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. The central bank
bought Treasury and mortgage debt valued at $2.3 trillion in the
first two rounds.  Policy makers are battling an  unemployment rate  that has
topped 8 percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in
monthly records dating back to 1948. The  U.S. economy  has so far
recovered about 4.1 million of the 8.8 million jobs lost in the
wake of the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  Demand for Treasuries will be sustained and yields will
likely increase only “moderately” and reach 2 percent by year-
end and 2.20 percent in the middle of 2013. That’s still more
bearish than the median of 76 economists’ and strategists’
predictions compiled by Bloomberg, which see the rate reaching 2
percent in June.  Orders Fall  German orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation,
fell 1.3 percent from July, when they rose 0.3 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a 0.5
percent drop, according to the median of 31 estimates in a
 Bloomberg News survey .  Germany’s  10-year bund  yield climbed four basis points to
1.48 percent.  Treasuries are “the ultimate safe-haven asset of the
world’s reserve currency,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at
Investec Bank Plc in  London . “The payroll numbers are likely to
dictate the direction of risk assets for the day.”  The  yield gap  between 10-year notes and similar-maturity
inflation-linked bonds, a gauge of expectations for consumer
prices, widened 20 basis points this week to 2.62 percentage
points. It’s poised for the biggest increase this year after a
gain of 27 basis points in the week ended Sept. 14.  Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities “seem to suggest
that investors do not completely trust the Fed to deliver on its
2 percent inflation target,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said yesterday in a speech in  Memphis ,
 Tennessee .  To contact the reporter on this story:
