Colombia ’s peso bond yields posted
their biggest weekly drop since May 2011 as speculation
inflation slowed in September and the central bank will lower
interest rates boosted demand for the fixed-rate securities.  The yield on the government’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in July 2024 fell 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage
point, to 6.15 percent, according to the central bank, the
lowest level since the debt was first sold in 2009. The yield
dropped for a third week, declining 20 basis points.  “Inflation will remain under control, creating a favorable
environment for the fixed-income market,” said Juan Pablo Espinosa, the head of economic research at  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO) , the
country’s biggest bank. “There is room for gains across the
curve in the next month.”  Annual inflation slowed to 2.95 percent in September,
according to the median forecast of 27 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is slated to release
the report at 7 p.m. today in Bogota. That would be the first
time since April 2011 that inflation slowed to below the
midpoint of the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target.  While the outlook for consumer prices will still favor
long-term bonds, shorter-term debt will advance as the central
bank reduces borrowing costs further, Espinosa predicts.  Target Rate  Banco de la Republica held the overnight lending rate at
4.75 percent on Sept. 28 after a cut of a quarter-percentage
point in August. Espinosa forecasts policy makers will lower the
rate by another 25 basis points to 4.5 percent this year.  The search for higher returns in  emerging markets  as
 interest rates  in the U.S. and  Europe  stay near zero is also
helping fuel a rally in Colombia’s peso bonds, said Felipe
Campos, the head analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores in Bogota.  “There is an aggressive search for yield,” said Campos.  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 1,795.90 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its gain this week to 0.3 percent. The currency has
rallied 7.9 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
