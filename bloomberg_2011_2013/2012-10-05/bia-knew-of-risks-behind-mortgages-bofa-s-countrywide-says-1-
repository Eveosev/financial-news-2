MBIA Inc. (MBI) , which sued  Bank of America
Corp. ’s Countrywide Financial in 2008 over mortgages backing
securities the insurer guaranteed, knew of the risks behind the
loans and can’t claim it was defrauded, Countrywide said.  MBIA knew of the risk of losses on the securities it agreed
to insure and placed $21 billion at risk in 15 securitizations
without reviewing a single loan file, Countrywide said in a
filing today in New York State Supreme Court in  Manhattan .  “Countrywide provided MBIA with ample warning of the risks
involved in insuring the securitizations,” Countrywide said in
a motion seeking pre-trial summary judgment rulings in its
favor.  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of America and MBIA,
which also filed a summary judgment motion today, will argue the
motions before Justice Eileen Bransten.  MBIA claimed in its filing that at least 56 percent of the
loans at issue were “materially defective” and that
Countrywide compounded its misconduct by refusing to buy back
loans. Countrywide also orchestrated a strategy to frustrate the
repurchase process, the bond insurer said.  “Countrywide’s overarching goal in responding to
repurchase demands was to reduce exposure and limit losses to
the company, rather than adhere to its contractual repurchase
obligations,” Armonk, New York-based MBIA said.  The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Countrywide Home Loans
Inc., 602825-2008,  New York  State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
