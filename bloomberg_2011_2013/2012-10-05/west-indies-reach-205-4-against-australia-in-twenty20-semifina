Chris Gayle’s 75 runs pushed West
Indies to 205-4 in its cricket World Twenty20 semifinal against
Australia in  Sri Lanka .  Gayle faced 41 balls and had 6 sixes and 4 fours, combining
with Dwayne Bravo for 83 runs. Bravo was out for 37, while
 Kieron Pollard  was caught on 38 off the last ball of the 20
overs.  West Indies, which won the toss and elected to bat in
Colombo, hit 14 sixes and 13 fours. Xavier Doherty took the
brunt of the batting, taking 1-48, while  Shane Watson  conceded
35 runs without claiming a wicket.  The winner will face Sri Lanka, which beat Pakistan

prize money.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
