An Iranian supertanker is heading to
 South Korea  with a cargo of oil, according to shipping data, as
the Islamic republic uses state-owned tankers to make deliveries
in response to sanctions over its nuclear program.  The Brawny, a very large crude carrier that can take on 2
million barrels of oil, left the Iranian port of Kharg Island
yesterday and is provisionally scheduled to discharge its cargo
at Daesan in South Korea, according to transmissions captured by
 IHS Inc. (IHS)  on Bloomberg. National Iranian Tanker Co. owns the
vessel. Hyundai Oilbank Co. operates a 395,000 barrel-a-day
 refinery  in Daesan.  South Korea, which imports almost all its crude
requirements, was granted an exemption in June from U.S.
sanctions on imports of Iranian oil. The country in August
halted shipments from the Persian Gulf nation after its refiners
lost insurance coverage, customs data showed Sept. 15. India and
 Japan , two of the largest buyers of Iranian crude, offer state-
backed insurance for their Iranian purchases.  Separately, SK Innovation Co. took delivery of an Iranian
crude shipment on Oct. 2 in Ulsan, according to Yoo Jung Min, a
spokesman at South Koreaâ€™s largest refiner. He declined to
identify the vessel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
