Canada  natural gas prices declined as
 weather forecasts  called for a return to warmer-than-normal
temperatures in mid-October, which may reduce demand for gas
used in heating.  November  gas in Alberta  fell 1 percent. Temperatures will
be above seasonal averages across much of the central and
western U.S. from Oct. 15 to Oct. 19, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. Temperatures in Minneapolis
may reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) on Oct. 16, 12
degrees above normal.  “The weather models were actually much warmer than they
were in the morning,” said Aaron Calder, a market analyst with
Gelber & Associates Corp. in Houston. “It was a large departure
from the forecast that we were looking at over the past week.”  Forecasts had been shifting toward colder weather for
October earlier in the week as a cool front blanketed the
central U.S. Weather Derivatives of Belton,  Missouri , said U.S.
average heating demand will be 41 percent above the seasonal
average over the next seven days.  Alberta gas for November delivery declined 3 cents, or 1
percent, to C$2.935 per gigajoule ($2.84 per million British
thermal units) as of 3:35 p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian
electronic exchange.  Natural gas for November delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  declined 1 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $3.396
per million Btu.  Alberta System  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output from most of Canada’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet at 4:30 p.m. New York time, 498 million cubic feet below
target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2 billion cubic feet at
Empress,  Alberta , where the fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  There was 119 million cubic feet of capacity available on
TransCanada’s  British Columbia system  at Kingsgate. The system
was forecast to carry 1.55 billion cubic feet today, with
estimated capacity of 1.67 billion cubic feet.  The volume on  Spectra Energy Corp.’s  British Columbia
system, which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia
for delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled
2.85 billion cubic feet at 4:35 p.m.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
dropped 7 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.34 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas declined 6.83 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.1555
per million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, prices fell 1.55 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $3.2471.  To contact the reporter on this story:
