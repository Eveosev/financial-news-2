Copper futures fell for the second
time in three days as commodities tumbled, spurred by slumping
energy prices.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24  raw materials 
fell as much as 1.4 percent. Crude oil headed for the third
straight weekly decline, the longest slump in four months, on
signs of ample supplies. Most industrial metals traded in  London 
dropped.  “With oil weakening, it spills over,”  Edward Meir , an
analyst at FCStone Inc. in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “Many of the funds trade in baskets of commodities,
and when they see oil falling, they get nervous. Oil is sort of
the locomotive because it’s such an important commodity.”  Copper futures for December delivery declined 0.2 percent
to settle at $3.778 a pound at 1:21 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price climbed 0.5 percent this week.  More signs this week of a slowing economy in  China , the
world’s biggest metal user, may weaken copper, Meir said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.1 percent to $8,295 a metric ton ($3.76 a pound).
Tin, lead, nickel and aluminum dropped, while zinc rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
