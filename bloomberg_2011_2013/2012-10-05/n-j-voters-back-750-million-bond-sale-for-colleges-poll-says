Most  New Jersey  voters support a
referendum authorizing a $750 million bond sale to fund capital
projects at colleges and universities, a poll shows.  Sixty-two percent back the ballot initiative, compared with
56 percent a month ago, according to the Rutgers-Eagleton survey
released today. The referendum endorsed by Republican Governor
 Chris Christie  earmarks the money to build classrooms and
upgrade technology.  Voters also backed a proposed amendment to the state
constitution that would allow Christie and lawmakers to require
judges to pay more toward pensions and benefits. Seventy percent
backed that measure.  The state has 31 public colleges, including three research
institutions:  Rutgers University , the University of Medicine and
Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of
Technology. Combined, they have a full- and part-time enrollment
of almost 358,700 students, according to state figures.  Researchers at New Brunswick-based Rutgers surveyed 790
registered voters from Sept. 27 to Sept. 30. The poll has a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
