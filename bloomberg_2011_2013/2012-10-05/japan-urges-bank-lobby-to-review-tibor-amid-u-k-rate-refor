Ikko Nakatsuka,  Japan ’s new financial
services minister, urged the country’s bank lobby to determine
whether its process for setting the benchmark yen lending rate
should be revamped.  The Japanese Bankers Association should identify what
improvements, if any, need to be made to guidelines for
submissions used to set the  Tokyo  Interbank Offered Rate,
Nakatsuka told a group reporters in Tokyo today.  Comments from the minister, who was appointed Oct. 1 in a
Cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, come as the
U.K. looks to reform governance and management related to
setting the London Interbank Offered Rate following a Libor
manipulation scandal there.  Yasuhiro Sato, who heads the lobby group, said July 19 his
association completed a month-long review of member banks to
ensure they follow its guidelines. No issues related to its
framework for setting Tibor were found, he said.  In Japan, reference banks including the lending units of
 Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306)  are responsible for
submitting interbank offered rates to the association, which
compiles them and sets the benchmark, according to the group’s
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
