Canada ’s budget deficit for last
fiscal year narrowed less than the government previously
forecast on weaker revenue, the Finance Department said today.  The shortfall in the 12 months through March 31 shrank to
C$26.2 billion ($26.9 billion), from C$33.4 billion in the
previous year, the department said in its annual financial
 report  published on its website. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty
predicted a shortfall of C$24.9 billion in his March 29 budget.  Flaherty said in August he may need to revise his deficit
targets amid risks to the global recovery, saying he may be
losing the cushion he built into his fiscal plan as the world’s
11th-largest economy slows.  “The global economic environment is still fragile and
uncertain,” Flaherty said in today’s report, citing “downside
risks” to the projections in his most recent budget. “Any
setbacks in the global economic recovery can be expected to have
an impact on Canada.”  Revenue  in the previous fiscal year rose 3.4 percent to
C$245.2 billion from a year earlier, compared with a March
projection of C$248 billion, the documents show.  The government’s expenses were C$271.4 billion for the
year. The government’s budget had projected expenses of C$272.9
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
