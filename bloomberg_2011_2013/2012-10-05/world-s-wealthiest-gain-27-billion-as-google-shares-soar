The 100 richest people on Earth
gained a combined $26.9 billion this week as an unexpected drop
in the American unemployment rate bolstered confidence in the
world’s largest economy.  The fortunes of Google Inc. founders  Sergey Brin , 39, and
 Larry Page , 39, reached their highest point ever Thursday.
Google shares established a record high after the Mountain View,
California-based company announced it had settled a lawsuit with
five publishers over the digital scanning of books. Brin and
Page rank 20th and 23th in the world with net worths of about
$23 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “Good news on multiple fronts kept the S&P near its five
year high this week,” said Nelson Saiers, chief investment
officer of Alphabet Management LLC, a New York-based hedge fund
with more than $500 million under management. “It started with
the positive manufacturing number Monday and concluded with the
surprisingly low  unemployment rate .”  In the U.S., the unemployment rate dropped to 7.8 percent
in September, the lowest since President Barack Obama took
office in 2009, as employers took on more part-time workers. The
economy added 114,000 workers, in-line with economists’
estimates, and August’s growth was revised higher by 46,000 jobs
to 142,000.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.41 percent during
the week to close at 1460.93 in New York, its highest close
since 2007. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 2.1 percent, closing
at 274.11.  Slim, Batista  Mexican telecommunications magnate Carlos Slim, 72, remains
the richest person in the world, with a fortune of $77.5
billion, up $2.2 billion for the week. Second is  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
co-founder Bill Gates, 56, with $64.4 billion.  Amancio Ortega ,
the 76-year-old founder of  Inditex SA (ITX) , owner of the Zara
clothing chain, is No. 3 on the index with a net worth of $53.6
billion, $5.2 billion ahead of  Warren Buffett . Ortega has added
more than $18 billion to his fortune this year.  Eike Batista, Brazil’s richest person, shed $926 million
from his net worth this week. Shares of his mining startup,  MMX
Mineracao (MMXM3)  & Metalicos SA, hit its lowest price since 2009 on
concern it will take longer than targeted to make the first
iron-ore shipment from its Sudeste port.  Separately, the billionaire told reporters he may cut his
stake in his shipbuilding unit,  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , after he injects
$1 billion into the company. He also may announce the $2 billion
sale of 49 percent of closely held gold unit AUX to Qatar as
soon as the end of the month, a person with direct knowledge of
the negotiations told Bloomberg News this week.  Zuckerberg Optimistic  Facebook Inc. (FB)  founder  Mark Zuckerberg ’s fortune is down
$6.8 billion for the year. The company told Bloomberg
Businessweek that its user base had eclipsed the 1 billion mark
in September. Despite his sagging fortune, the 28-year-old
remains optimistic about his company’s future.  “The big thing is obviously going to be mobile,” he said.
“There are five billion people in the world who have phones and
a billion people using Facebook. There are actually already 600
million people using Facebook on phones, so that’s growing
really quickly. And as more phones become smartphones, it’s just
this massive opportunity.”  Zuckerberg ranks 88th in the world with a net worth of
$10.7 billion.  The Bloomberg Billionaires Index takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and  Bloomberg News  reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York. The valuations are
listed in U.S. dollars. The collective wealth of the index is
$1.9 trillion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
