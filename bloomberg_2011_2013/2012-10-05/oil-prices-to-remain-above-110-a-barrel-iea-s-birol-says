Following are comments on crude oil,
natural gas and the nuclear industry from Fatih Birol, Chief
Economist at the International Energy Agency. He spoke today at
a conference in Ankara.  On the crude price:  “In the coming months and years, it will be a surprise to
see oil prices dropping below $110.”  On the impact of oil on the economy:  “The high prevailing prices of oil which are around $110
per barrel is possibly the greatest risk to the global economic
recovery. These high prices reduce the contribution of countries
such as  China  to global economy.”  “Increasing oil and natural gas prices are a significant
risk for developing countries such as  Turkey . Even Saudi Arabia,
despite the fact that it is an oil producing country, admits
that such high oil prices are a risk for the global economy.”  On Japan:  “The Japanese government said two weeks ago that the share
of nuclear power in electricity generation would decline and
that they would take the necessary steps to assure this. After
the earthquake,  France  and  Germany  also made similar comments to
reduce the share of nuclear. These steps could lead to serious
negative ramifications. These steps could also have negative
impact on the climate. Nevertheless, the share of nuclear in
energy generation in China, South Korea,  India  and hopefully
Turkey will increase in the future.”  On natural gas:  “Natural gas was a quiet revolution that affects us all.
New energy products will affect the geo politics of energy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
