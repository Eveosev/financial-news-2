U.S. stocks erased an early rally as
optimism about a drop in the unemployment rate faded, with banks
reversing gains and shares of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumping.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was down less than 0.1
percent at 1,460.2 at 2:58 p.m. in New York. The index rallied
as much as 0.7 percent earlier, topping its best closing level
in five years, following an unexpected decrease in the U.S.
jobless rate to a three-year low of 7.8 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite Index erased a similar rally as Apple
sank 1.9 percent to below its average price from the past 50
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
