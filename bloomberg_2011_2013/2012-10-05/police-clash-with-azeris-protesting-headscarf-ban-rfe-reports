Police used tear gas to disperse a
group of Azeris  protesting  a ban on Islamic headscarves, or
hijabs, Radio Free  Europe /Radio Liberty reported.  Truncheon-wielding police prevented demonstrators from
rallying outside the Education Ministry in the capital, Baku.
The protesters fought back with sticks, according to pictures on
the website of the Azeri service of RFE/RL. Today’s clash left
several people injured from both sides, according to the report.  Sahlab Bagirov, deputy head of the Baku police, was among
the injured, according to privately owned APA news service.  Religious activists have held several rallies in Baku since
the government introduced new school uniforms in 2009, banning
Islamic-style headscarves. Azeri officials accused Iran of
provoking religious groups against the secular government of
President Ilham Aliyev. Most Azeris share  Iran ’s Shiite Muslim
religion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
