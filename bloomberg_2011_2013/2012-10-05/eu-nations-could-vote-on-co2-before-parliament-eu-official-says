European Union governments could vote
on a measure to delay sales of some carbon permits before a
related parliamentary vote to amend the bloc’s emissions law,
an EU official said.  Representatives of national governments in the Climate
Change Committee could hold a vote on a planned measure to
postpone auctions of permits and then decide to delay the start
of a mandatory scrutiny period until a decision on the law
change is made in a separate process, the official said.  The European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, is
considering various procedural scenarios on its two-element plan
to curtail the excess supply of permits, according to the
official, who declined to be identified, citing policy. The
commission’s draft strategy involves the proposed amendment and
a separate measure to “backload” a number of permits at
auctions as of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
