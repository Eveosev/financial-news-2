U.S. stock futures extended gains
after government data showed the nation added 114,000 jobs last
month and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 7.8
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index expiring in
December increased 0.4 percent to 1,461.6 at 8:31 a.m. in New
York.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 16 percent this year as policy
makers around the world attempted to safeguard the global
economy. The benchmark index reached the highest level since
2007 on Sept. 14 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the central bank will buy $40 billion of mortgage
securities a month, a third round of quantitative easing
nicknamed QE3 by investors.  Fed officials said they could change the size of the
purchases to reduce the risks associated with the program, such
as disrupting financial markets and spurring inflation,
according to minutes from their last meeting released yesterday.  For the first time this year,  hedge funds  are turning away
from a rally in the global stock market. The ratio of bullish to  bearish bets among professional speculators fell last week and
is below historical averages, according to a survey by
International Strategy & Investment Group. The reduction came as  the MSCI All-Country World Index extended its yearly advance to
12 percent and contrasts with January, when managers bought
shares as they rose, data compiled by ISI and Bloomberg show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
