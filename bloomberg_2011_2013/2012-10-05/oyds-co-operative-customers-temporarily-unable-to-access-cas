Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and Co-
Operative Bank Plc said some of their 23.5 million customers
were temporarily unable to access their accounts today following
separate computer failures at the U.K. lenders.  The problems have now been fixed and the banks are working
to clear up any backlogs caused by the glitches, the companies
said in e-mailed statements today. The banks didn’t say how many
customers were affected.  “All of our systems are now up and running,” Lloyds, the
U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender, said in a statement. “We are
working hard to process the transactions impacted by this
problem and they will be resolved before the close of play
today.”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s biggest
government-owned bank, made a provision of 125 million pounds
($202 million) in August to cover costs linked to a computer
failure at its consumer bank in June that left most of its 15
million account holders unable to access their accounts for
days. The problems at Lloyds and Co-Op only affected customers
today, the firms said.  “We can confirm that our systems are now fully operational
and customers should now be able to use their accounts as
normal,” Co-Op said in a statement. “We would like to
apologize for the inconvenience caused by this temporary
issue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
