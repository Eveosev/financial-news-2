In 1840, William Henry Lane
enraptured audiences with his smooth moves. Showman P.T. Barnum
first presented him to the public in blackface, with giant
vermillion lips and a woolly wig.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  For  Charles Dickens , who saw his act in  New York , Lane was
the “greatest dancer known,” capable of “snapping his
fingers, rolling his eyes, turning in his knees, presenting the
backs of his legs in front, spinning about on his toes and heels
like nothing but the man’s fingers on the tambourine.”  In fact, Lane was a black man, burnt cork hiding his race.
A white audience at the time would have felt insulted if
presented with a real black dancer.  By 1844, Lane was so popular he could drop the racist
pretense. He appeared with a white troupe before white
theatergoers, in the process integrating the American stage.  I spoke with Yuval Taylor, co-author of “Darkest America:
Black Minstrelsy from Slavery to Hip-Hop,” on the following
topics:  1. Minstrel Popularity  2. Racist Stereotypes  3. Black Freedom  4. Minstrel Influence  5. Hip-Hop  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
