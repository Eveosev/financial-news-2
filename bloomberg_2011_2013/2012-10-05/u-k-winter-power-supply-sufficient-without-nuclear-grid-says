The U.K. has sufficient electricity
production margins to prevent power cuts this winter even should
the country’s nine nuclear plants be excluded, grid operator
 National Grid Plc (NG/)  said.  Britain has enough security of supply to “live without”
its reactors in the period, Chris Train, National Grid’s network
operations director, said today at a conference in  London .  The surplus of generating capacity to electricity demand is
about 14 percent for the six-month period from October, and will
decline to 4 percent by the winter of 2015 to 2016, according to
a report published today by U.K. regulator Ofgem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
