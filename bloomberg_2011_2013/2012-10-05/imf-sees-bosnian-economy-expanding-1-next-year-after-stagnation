Bosnia-Herzegovina’s economy will
probably grow 1 percent in 2013 after stagnating this year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in a report today.  To unlock growth potential, the former Yugoslav republic
should accelerate “the pace of structural reforms,” improve
the business environment and the labor market, the Washington-
based lender said a week after granting Bosnia a 403.5 million-
euro (526.24 million) loan to counter the effects of a
deteriorating global economy and to address domestic weaknesses.  The IMF supports Bosnia’s economic program, which “focuses
on maintaining fiscal discipline, safeguarding the soundness of
the financial sector and intensifying reforms to improve the
business and investment environment,” according to the report.  Bosnia, divided into two entities, the Serb-dominated
Republika Srpska and the Croat-Muslim Federation, has pledged to
improve national policy coordination, strengthen the role of its
Fiscal Council, continue fiscal consolidation, protect the
currency-board regime and improve the resilience of the
financial sector, the IMF said.  The IMF sees Bosnia narrowing its  budget deficit  to 2.3
percent of economic output in 2013 from 3 percent this year. The
current-account deficit is expected to contract to 7.3 percent
of gross domestic product next year from 7.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
