Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
compared Greeks’ struggle with economic hardship and political
turmoil with the conditions that led to the collapse of the
 Weimar Republic  in post-World War I  Germany  and ushered in the
Nazi era.  “Greek democracy stands before what is perhaps its
greatest challenge,” Samaras said in an interview with German
newspaper Handelsblatt published today, saying that Greeks’
living standards have plunged by more than a third in five
years. The cohesion of Greek society is “endangered by rising
unemployment, just as it was toward the end of the Weimar
Republic in Germany.”  Just as the 1919-1933 Weimar years were marked by running
battles between Communists and fascists, society at large in
Greece today is threatened by extreme left-wing populists and
“something that’s new to this country: the rise of an extreme
right, you could almost say fascist, neo-Nazi party,” he said.  Samaras, who managed to form a governing coalition with two
rival parties after winning the country’s second set of
elections this year, is trying to convince  Greece ’s
international creditors that his government has done enough to
secure its next bailout payment.  If his government were to fall, “chaos awaits,” he said,
according to Handelsblatt. “The people know this government is
Greece’s last chance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
