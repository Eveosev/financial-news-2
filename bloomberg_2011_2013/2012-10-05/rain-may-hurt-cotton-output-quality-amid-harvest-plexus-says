Cotton production and quality in the
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter, may be hurt by rain that
fell during the past week, according to Plexus Cotton Ltd.  The timing was “inopportune” because “most fields are
defoliated and ready for harvest,” the Liverpool, U.K.-based
company said in an e-mailed report today. “In the mid-south,
only around 25 percent had been picked prior to the rain, and it
is therefore likely that the quality has suffered.”  Precipitation was 0.25 inch to 1.5 inches over the past
week, with some growing areas getting more, said Kyle Tapley, a
meteorologist with MDA Information Systems LLC. “At this point,
rain is a bad thing for the crop since it slows the harvest and
reduces crop quality,” he said in an e-mail from Gaithersburg,
 Maryland .  Over the past month, rainfall has been near to above normal
across most producing regions, ranging from 85 percent to 175
percent of the seasonal average, Tapley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
