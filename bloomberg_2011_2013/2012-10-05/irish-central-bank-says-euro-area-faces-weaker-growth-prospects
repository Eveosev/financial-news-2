The Irish central bank said the euro-
area economy faces weaker growth prospects and risks are on the
downside.  “Following the contraction in euro-area growth in the
second quarter, available indicators for the third quarter point
to weaker growth prospects and highlight prevailing
uncertainty,” the Dublin-based institution said in its
quarterly bulletin published today. “The risks surrounding the
economic outlook for the euro area are noted to be on the
downside.”  The euro-area economy shrank 0.2 percent in the second
quarter and unemployment has been at a record high of 11.4
percent since June. The  European Central Bank  last month
announced details of an unlimited bond-buying program to fight
speculation of a currency break-up and President  Mario Draghi 
said yesterday he stands ready to intervene if governments like
 Spain  request a bailout and agree to conditions. In the U.S.,
Federal Reserve officials last month agreed to expand monetary
stimulus by purchasing additional assets.  “There has been an improvement in financial-market
sentiment, largely on account of further policy measures
announced by major central banks,” the Irish central bank said.
“Nevertheless, the recovery in advanced economies is expected
to be subdued, reflecting the ongoing adjustment to imbalances
accumulated in the years leading up to the financial crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
