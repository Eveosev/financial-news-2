Primary dealers saw the  Federal
Reserve  raising its benchmark  interest rate  in the second half
of 2015 in a survey conducted by the central bank before the
Sept. 12-13 policy meeting.  The median respondent in the survey by the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York saw the central bank increasing interest rates
in the third quarter of 2015, up from the first quarter of 2015
in the survey conducted before the  Federal Open Market
Committee ’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting.  Fed officials extended their horizon for low interest rates
through at least the middle of 2015 in a statement after their
meeting in Washington. They also announced a third round of
asset purchases, saying they’d buy $40 billion of mortgage-
backed securities each month.  Bond dealers saw a 65 percent chance the Fed would expand
its balance sheet through securities purchases at that FOMC
meeting, according to the median response from results updated
on Sept. 11. They also saw 80 percent odds the FOMC would change
its forward guidance on the path of interest rates.  After the last FOMC meeting, the Fed asked primary dealers
to update their expectations for the size of the central bank’s
portfolio and reserves balances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
