Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s
Altimo increased its voting stake in mobile-phone operator
 VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  to 41.9 percent after buying about 1.4 percent of
the company’s shares from the market, it said in a regulatory
filing today.  Altimo and Norway’s  Telenor ASA (TEL) , which owns 43 percent of
VimpelCom’s voting shares, have been fighting since February for
control over the mobile-phone operator, which has assets Russia,
Italy,  Africa  and Asia. Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service has been
stopping Telenor from gaining control of the company, which owns
strategic assets in the country.  “The stock price looked appealing and we took an
opportunity to boost our stake because VimpelCom shares are
highly attractive as an investment,” Altimo Vice President
Evgeny Dumalkin said by telephone from Moscow.  Ukrainian businessman Viktor Pinchuk owns 6 percent of
VimpelCom, and both Altimo and Telenor have said they are
interested in this stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
