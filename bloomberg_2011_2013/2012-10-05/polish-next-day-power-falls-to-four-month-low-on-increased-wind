Polish power for Saturday fell to its
lowest level in almost four months as higher-than-usual wind
output outweighed increased exports.  Power for tomorrow  decreased 12 percent from a week earlier
to 159.42 zloty ($51.13) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange
data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level for Saturday
delivery since June 9.  Wind speeds in Gdansk, northern  Poland , the region where
most turbines are located, are predicted at 26 kilometers (16
miles) per hour tomorrow, more than double the average of the
last 10 years, CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Flows of electricity to the  Czech Republic ,  Germany  and
Slovakia were set be at 1,051 megawatts between 5 p.m. and 6
p.m. tomorrow, compared with no exports at the same time a week
ago. Inflows from Sweden were set to be cut by about 50 percent
to 300 megawatts for most of the day, data from the grid
operator  PSE Operator SA  showed.  PGE SA (PGE) , Poland’s largest utility was set to halt a 370-
megawatt unit at its Belchatow plant tomorrow, while the start
of a 380-megawatt unit at the power station was delayed by three
days to Oct. 9, the grid manager said.  Next-day contracts on the Czech and Slovak markets settled
1.1 percent higher from a week ago at 37.19 euros ($48.57) a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators. Electricity for the next day in  Hungary  jumped
8.8 percent to 39.99 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
