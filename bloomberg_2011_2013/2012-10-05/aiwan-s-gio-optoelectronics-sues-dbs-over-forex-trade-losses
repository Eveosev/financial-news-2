GIO Optoelectronics Corp. (3610) , a
Taiwanese maker of LED lights and fluorescent tubes, said it
sued  DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS)  over losses in foreign exchange
trading last year.  GIO filed a civil lawsuit to the Taipei District Court
seeking an initial NT$50 million ($1.7 million) in damages, and
reserves the right to seek a further NT$830 million in U.S.
dollars from the transactions which took place from May to
August last year, the company said in a statement to the Taiwan
exchange on Oct. 3.  The statement didn’t say whether DBS is the only bank
involved or outline any wrongdoing allegedly undertaken by the
Singapore-based company. GIO spokesman Y.C. Hsueh couldn’t be
reached immediately at his office as he was out for a meeting.  “DBS Bank (Taiwan) Ltd. regrets that GIO has raised a civil
claim against DBS Bank Ltd. as the FX transactions were done in
compliance with applicable laws and regulations,”  Karen Ngui , a
Singapore-based spokeswoman at DBS Group, said in an e-mailed
statement. “As the case is now undergoing civil proceedings, it
is not appropriate to make any further comments.”  Controlled by  Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481) , Taiwan’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, GIO last year posted foreign
exchange losses of NT$1.83 billion on revenue of NT$5 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
