Oil capped a third weekly drop in New
York as signals that supply is exceeding demand outweighed an
unexpected decline in the  unemployment rate .  Futures completed the longest run of weekly decreases since
June after the Energy Department reported Oct. 3 that U.S.  crude
output  rose to 6.52 million barrels a day last week, the most
since December 1996. Prices pared their descent earlier when
government data showed the U.S. added 114,000 jobs last month as
the jobless rate fell to 7.8 percent.  “The fundamentals of the oil market point to ample
supplies, especially here in the U.S., and anemic demand,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There is some positive sentiment in the
employment data, which is providing some support.”  Crude oil for November delivery fell $1.83, or 2 percent,
to settle at $89.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices declined 2.5 percent this week.  Brent oil for November settlement slipped 56 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $112.02 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. The European benchmark grade
was at a premium of $22.14 to New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate, the widest differential since Oct. 21, 2011. The
spread was up from $20.87 yesterday.  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI, rose 135,000 barrels to 43.9 million last week, according
to the department. Surging output from shale-rock formations in
the U.S., including the Bakken in  North Dakota , and from
Canada’s oil sands has bolstered supplies at the hub. Nationwide
stockpiles were up 8.4 percent from a year earlier.  Gasoline supplies climbed 114,000 barrels to 195.9 million
last week, the first gain in 10 weeks, the report showed.  Widening Spread  “The U.S. supply picture explains why WTI continues to
decline more than Brent and the spread has widened,” McGillian
said.  Total U.S. fuel demand fell 0.3 percent to  18.3 million
barrels  a day in the four weeks ended Sept. 28, the lowest level
since April, the Oct. 3 Energy Department report showed.  “The challenging demand situation here is more than enough
to neutralize the impact of the better-than-expected jobs
numbers,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based energy hedge fund.  The  U.S. economy  added a revised 142,000 jobs in August,
Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for an
advance of 115,000 in September. The jobless rate dropped from
8.1 percent and hourly earnings climbed more than forecast.  German Orders  German factory orders dropped more than economists forecast
in August as the debt crisis damped the outlook for growth in
Europe’s largest economy. Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings
and inflation, fell 1.3 percent from July, the Economy Ministry
in Berlin said today. A 0.5 percent decrease was forecast,
according to the median of 31 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey .  China ’s services purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.7 in
September from 56.3 in August, the National Bureau of Statistics
and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in Beijing
Oct. 3. The number was lower than any previous reading in data
compiled by Bloomberg starting in March 2011.  “The oil market is really looking beyond the U.S.,”
Kilduff said. “The demand prospects on the horizon in China and
Europe don’t look promising and are keeping a lid on prices.”  Prices tumbled 4.1 percent on Oct. 3 after the Energy
Department report, the biggest decline since June 21. Futures
rose 4.1 percent yesterday, the most since Aug. 3.  Market ‘Confusion’  “We dropped more than $3.50 on Tuesday and then rose by
about the same amount yesterday,” said  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
“There’s obviously a lot of confusion out there when there’s
this much volatility in the market. We’re trying to figure out
what direction to go in.”  Oil in New York may slide next week as U.S. production
rises, a Bloomberg survey showed. Twenty-one of 38 analysts, or
55 percent, forecast prices will drop through Oct. 12. Thirteen
respondents, or 34 percent, predicted it will gain and four saw
little change.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 512,734
contracts as of 3:53 p.m. Volume totaled 552,980 contracts
yesterday, 5.6 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
