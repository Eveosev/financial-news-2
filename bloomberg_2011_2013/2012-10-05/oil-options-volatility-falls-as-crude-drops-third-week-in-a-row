Crude oil options volatility slid for
a second day as the underlying futures declined on concern that
supply is exceeding demand.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 27.8 percent as of 4:05 p.m.  New York  time,
down from 29.6 percent the day before.  Crude oil for November delivery fell $1.83, or 2 percent,
to settle at $89.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Futures declined 2.5 percent this week, capping the
longest run of weekly decreases since June, after the Energy
Department reported Oct. 3 that U.S. crude output rose to 6.52
million barrels a day last week, the most since December 1996.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
December $85 puts, which rose 27 cents to $1.60 a barrel at 4:13
p.m. with 1,768 lots trading. December $90 puts were the second-
most active, with 1,647 lots changing hands as they rose 56
cents to $3.42 a barrel.  Bets that prices would rise accounted for 51 percent of the
38,873 contracts in electronic trading. One contract covers
1,000 barrels of oil.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 57
percent of the 150,218 contracts exchanged.  December $100 calls were the most active options, with
12,417 contracts trading while rising 46 cents to $1.10 a
barrel. November $80 puts were second-most active, with 6,000
contracts changing hands. They fell 19 cents to 5 cents a
barrel.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
50,527 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 47,084
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
