Iceland’s central bank said risks in
its financial industry have decreased alongside an economic
recovery on the north Atlantic island.  Until Iceland starts removing its currency controls, they
will protect the country’s markets from the global economic
crisis, the Reykjavik-based bank said in its Financial Stability
report today. Still, foreign loan repayments, which could rise
significantly in 2015, may weigh on the island’s currency,
according to the report.  Iceland’s economy collapsed in 2008 when its three major
lenders crumbled under $85 billion in debt. The banks’ failure
forced the country to seek a $4.6 billion bailout from the
 International Monetary Fund  and impose  capital controls  after
the krona sunk 80 percent in the offshore market against the
euro. The island completed a 33-month long economic program with
the Washington-based lender in August last year.  “The financial stability risk related to the unwinding of
the capital controls will not be revealed until” the bank
begins removing capital controls, Governor Mar Gudmundsson said
in the preface to the report. “It’s unlikely that any such
steps will be taken until at first in the coming year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
