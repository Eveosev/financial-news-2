Hong Kong’s Air Pollution Index was
“very high” at the Central and Mong Kok roadside-monitoring
stations, according to data from the Environmental Protection
Department on its website.  The index was 102 in Central business district, 111 in Mong
Kok and 85 in Causeway Bay as of 9 a.m. local time. Roadside
pollution of more than 100 triggers a government warning for
people with heart or respiratory illnesses to avoid prolonged
stays in heavy-traffic areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
