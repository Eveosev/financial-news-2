Ford Motor Co. (F)  of South Africa hired
 Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ’s water solutions subsidiary to design,
supply and install a new water-treatment plant to help in the
manufacturing of the new Ranger pickup in Pretoria.  The new facility should almost double the amount of water
recycled at the Silverton assembly plant to about 15 percent.
Cost of the facility from design to commissioning is about 20
million South African rand ($2.2 million), the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
