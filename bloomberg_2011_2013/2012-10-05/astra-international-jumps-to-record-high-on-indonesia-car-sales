PT Astra International (ASII) ,  Indonesia ’s
largest auto distributor, rose to a record after a report said
vehicle sales jumped and Bank of America Merrill Lynch and
Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded their ratings on the stock.  Astra rose 5.8 percent to 8,200 rupiah, closing at an all-
time high based on prices going back to August 1991. The  Jakarta
Composite Index (JCI)  gained 0.9 percent, also at a record.  Indonesia’s September domestic vehicle sales jumped 33
percent from a month earlier to 101,405 units,  Bisnis Indonesia 
reported, citing Jongkie D. Sugiarto, an executive at the
nation’s automotive industries association. The association did
not immediately answer calls to its office.  “Vehicle sales have been higher than we originally
expected,” Wisnu Karto, an analyst at PT Batavia Prosperindo
Sekuritas, said by phone in Jakarta today. “We are working on
an upgrade” of Astra’s share-price target, he said.  Bank of America raised Astra to buy from hold, while Credit
Suisse upgraded the stock to outperform, the equivalent of buy,
citing the company’s move to introduce low-cost green cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
