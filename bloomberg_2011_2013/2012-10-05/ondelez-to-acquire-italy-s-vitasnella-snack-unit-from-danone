Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ) , the
snacks and coffee business spun off from Kraft Foods Inc.,
agreed to buy Italy’s Vitasnella snack unit from  Danone (BN)  SA.  Danone, based in Paris, will retain the Vitasnella name and
dairy products business, Stefano Robba, a Mondelez spokesman,
said in an e-mail. Terms weren’t disclosed.  Mondelez, following its separation from Kraft’s North
American grocery enterprise, is adding new offerings to go
alongside its Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates. The company
split up to help the snacks business push products into emerging
markets while the slower-growing, higher-margin grocery business
returns cash to shareholders.  “This deal fits well into the recently announced spin-off
and relevant launch of a global snacking company, Mondelez
International,” said Robba.  Mondelez  fell  1 percent to $27.78 at 3:21 p.m. in  New York .  Reuters earlier reported on the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
