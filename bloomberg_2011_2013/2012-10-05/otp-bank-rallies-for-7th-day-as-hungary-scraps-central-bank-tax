OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, rallied for a seventh day as the government scrapped a
tax plan that was an obstacle to obtaining aid from the
 International Monetary Fund  and as European stocks climbed.  The shares rose 1 percent to 4,129 forint by 11:12 a.m. in
Budapest, extending their seven-day advance to 8.7 percent. The
benchmark BUX stock index added 0.3 percent.  The Cabinet will impose a levy on cash withdrawals from
next year, raise more than previously planned by taxing
transactions at the state treasury and delay a pay increase for
teachers to keep the budget deficit within 3 percent of gross
domestic product, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said at a
press conference in Budapest today. The measures will help the
Cabinet forgo a tax on central bank deals which threatened to
further delay the aid from the IMF which Hungary requested 11
months ago.  “The proposed package is a positive surprise compared to
earlier expectations and may provide basis for further loan
negotiations,”  Eszter Gargyan , a Budapest-based economist at
Citigroup Inc., wrote in an e-mailed report, adding that
implementation risks were “high.”  European stocks climbed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
heading for its first weekly gain in three, before a report that
may show U.S. payrolls expanded at a faster pace last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
