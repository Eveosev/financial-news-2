U.S. prosecutors charged three
brokers with making millions of dollars by lying about the
prices of securities they bought and sold for clients.  Marek Leszczynski and Benjamin Chouchane were arrested and
appeared in federal court today, according to the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in  Manhattan . A third man, Henry Condron,
pleaded guilty in the scheme earlier this week, the government
said.  All three men are former employees of the same brokerage
firm, which prosecutors didnâ€™t identify. Finra records show the
men all worked for LinkBrokers Derivatives Corp., a unit of
London-based  ICAP Plc. (IAP)   Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today filed a suit and claimed the three men and a fourth former
LinkBrokers employee, Gregory Reyftmann, illegally took
$18.7 million from customers by reporting fake execution prices
on more than 36,000 transactions over four years.  Guy Taylor, an ICAP spokesman, had no immediate comment on
the cases.  The criminal cases are U.S. v. Chouchane, 12-mj-2615; U.S.
v. Leszczynski, 12-mj-2614; and U.S. v. Condron; and the SEC
case is SEC v. Leszczynski, 12-cv-7488, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
