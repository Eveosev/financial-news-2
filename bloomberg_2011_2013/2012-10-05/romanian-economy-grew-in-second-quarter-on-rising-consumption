Romania’s economy grew in the second
quarter, driven by an increase in domestic demand, according to
the final figures from the  National Statistics Institute .  Gross domestic product  expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.5
percent from the previous quarter, matching reports on Aug. 14
and Sept. 6, and compared with revised growth of 0.1 percent in
the three months through March, the Bucharest-based institute
said in an e-mail today.  GDP grew a seasonally unadjusted 1.1 percent from a year
earlier, lower than the 1.2 percent figure in previous reports,
as the institute revised construction and consumption figures.
Consumption increased 1.3 percent in the second quarter compared
with a 1.1 percent estimate on Sept. 6, according to the
statement. Construction output rose 3.6 percent, less than the
5.2 percent growth previously released.  The eastern European country’s economic growth quickened in
the April-June period as the government increased state wages,
boosting domestic consumption to offset a slowdown in exports,
hit by the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe , its main trading
partner.  Romania’s economy went through a recession from the end of
2008 until the first quarter of 2010, according to  revised data 
from the Statistics Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
