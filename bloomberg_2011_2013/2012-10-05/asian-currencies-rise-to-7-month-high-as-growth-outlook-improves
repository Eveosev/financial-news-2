Asian currencies rose to a seven-
month high as U.S. jobs data that beat economists’ estimates
eased concern about a global slowdown and buoyed demand for
emerging-market assets.  India’s rupee led gains with its fifth weekly advance, the
longest winning streak since February, while South Korea’s won
reached an 11-month high. Data released Oct. 3 showed American
employers added 162,000 jobs last month, topping the median
forecast of 140,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The  European Central
Bank  held its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.75
percent on Oct. 4 and reiterated its readiness to buy bonds to
ease the debt crisis.  “The better data tone is allaying fears the global economy
was going to roll off the cliff,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
Singapore-based currency strategist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
“Confidence in the European outlook has improved.”  The rupee strengthened 1.9 percent this week to 51.8550 per
dollar in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 Philippine peso  gained 0.7 percent to 41.427 and  Thailand ’s baht
advanced 0.8 percent to 30.56. Malaysia’s ringgit rose 0.3
percent 3.0530.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, climbed as much as 0.4 percent
yesterday to 117.64, the highest since March 2. Its 60-day
 historical volatility  declined to 2.60 percent from 2.69 percent
a week ago. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares completed its
best back-to-back gain in three weeks after President  Mario
Draghi  said the ECB was prepared to start buying debt.  Fund Inflows  Growth in U.S. manufacturing and service industries also
exceeded economists’ forecasts, according to separate reports
earlier this week. Expansion in Asia excluding Japan will
accelerate to 7.3 percent in 2013 from 6.3 percent this year,
HSBC Holdings Plc’s Hong Kong-based economists Qu Hongbin and
 Frederic Neumann  wrote in a note released Oct. 4.  Foreign investors plowed $600 million into the stock
markets of India, Indonesia,  Taiwan  and Thailand this week,
according to exchange data. Emerging-market bond funds took in
$1.05 billion of new money in the week to Oct. 4, according to
research firm EPFR Global, taking this year’s inflows to $39
billion.  “With global central banks introducing measures to support
their economies, risk sentiment is improving,” said  Tsutomu Soma , manager of the investment trust and fixed-income business
unit at Rakuten Securities Inc. in Tokyo. “Developed nations
will keep  interest rates  low for a long time and that makes
higher yields offered by emerging countries attractive.”  India Reforms  India’s rupee rallied as foreign investors pumped money
into the nation’s stocks on speculation policy changes announced
by Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  will spur growth. The cabinet
Oct. 4 approved proposals allowing overseas companies to own as
much as 49 percent of insurers and permitted foreign investment
in pension funds for the first time.  “The wave of positive reforms from India has caught the
market’s attention,” analysts at Citigroup Inc., including
Singapore-based Gaurav Garg, wrote in a research report. “The
outperformance of the rupee to other regional peers is here to
stay as the reform juggernaut keeps rolling.”  Taiwan’s inflation slowed last month to 2.96 percent from
3.43 percent in August, according to government data released
yesterday. Price gains decelerated to 3.6 percent from 3.8
percent in the  Philippines , another report showed.  South Korea’s won rose for a second day to 1,111.40 per
dollar, erasing losses during the week after touching 1,109.60,
the strongest level since Nov. 1. A central bank report
yesterday showed the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves rose by
$5.13 billion to a record $322 billion.  Elsewhere, Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.1 percent yesterday to
NT$29.368 and Indonesia’s rupiah was little changed at 9.592.
Vietnam’s dong was steady at 20,890. Financial markets in China
were closed during the week for holidays.  To contact the reporters on this story:
