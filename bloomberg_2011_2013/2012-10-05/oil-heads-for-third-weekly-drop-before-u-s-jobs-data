Oil headed for a third weekly decline
in  New York  as concern that supply is exceeding demand
outweighed signs of a jobs recovery in the U.S., the world’s
largest consumer of crude.  Futures pared losses as the U.S. jobless rate unexpectedly
fell to 7.8 percent in September, the lowest since January 2009,
according to the Labor Department. The country’s crude output
climbed to the highest level in more than 15 years last week,
the Energy Department said.  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest
producer, sees no difficulty in meeting demand, Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi  said yesterday.  “In the short term the oil market is oversupplied as the
Saudis flood the market at a seasonally weak demand period,”
said Guy Wolf, a strategist at London-based commodities broker
Marex Spectron Group Ltd., who predicts  Brent crude  will advance
toward $125 a barrel this year as global growth picks up. “As
we head into the year-end the market will tighten.”  Crude for November delivery dropped 39 cents to $91.32 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 1:40 p.m. London time. The contract rose $3.57 to $91.71
yesterday. Prices are down 0.9 percent this week, in the longest
run of weekly declines since June, and 7.6 percent this year.  Brent for November settlement was at $112.45, 13 cents
lower on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude was at a premium of $21.19 to  New York- 
traded West Texas Intermediate grade. It widened to $21.46
earlier today, the biggest spread since Aug. 17.  Fibonacci Retracement  The  U.S. economy  added 114,000 workers last month after a
revised 142,000 gain in August that was more than initially
estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
The median estimate of 92 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an advance of 115,000. The jobless rate dropped from
8.1 percent and hourly earnings climbed more than forecast.  Prices of about $110 are “possibly the greatest risk to
the global economic recovery,”  Fatih Birol , chief economist at
the  International Energy Agency , said at a conference today in
Ankara,  Turkey . “It will be a surprise to see  oil prices 
dropping below” this level, he said.  Oil in New York has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop
to $32.40 in December 2008 from an intraday record high of
$147.27 in July that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels.  Mortar Bomb  Prices surged yesterday as Turkey’s parliament authorized
the government to order military action in  Syria  after a mortar
bomb fired across the border on Oct. 3 killed five Turks. The
decision highlights the risk that neighboring countries may be
drawn into Syria’s civil war. Countries in the  Middle East  and
North Africa were responsible for 36 percent of global oil
production and held 52 percent of proved reserves in 2011,
according to BP Plc’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  U.S. crude output rose by 11,000 barrels a day to 6.52
million last week, the most since December 1996, the Energy
Department reported on Oct. 3.  Oil prices may slide next week as U.S. production rises, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Twenty-one of 38 analysts, or 55
percent, forecast WTI will drop through Oct. 12. Thirteen
respondents, or 34 percent, predicted it will gain and four saw
little change.  U.S. crude output rose to 6.52 million barrels a
day last week, the most since December 1996, an Energy
Department report on Oct. 3 showed.  High Prices  “The situation with the oil market is that current and
forecast future demand levels over the next 12 months are well
covered by supply and that’s been the driving factor behind the
decline we’re seeing in recent weeks,” said Ric Spooner, a
chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.  Prices have been “very high” this year even with an
economic slowdown in many countries and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is helping to keep them under
control, al-Naimi said yesterday in Ankara.  Crude is on course for its strongest second half of the
year on record, according to the median of 26 analyst estimates
tracked by Bloomberg. WTI will cost $94.50 a barrel in New York
this quarter, up from $92.20 in the previous three months, the
predictions show. The previous highest level for any second half
was $91.78 a barrel, in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
