New York  Knicks’ radio analyst John
Andariese is resigning to spend more time with his family and
focus on his advertising business, ending a career with the
National Basketball Association team that began in 1972.  Andariese will be replaced by Brendan Brown, who was a
Knicks’ radio analyst for several games last season and who has
been a contributor since 2008, the team said in a news release.  “After what seems like a lifetime behind the microphone
and having the good fortune and privilege to be part of nearly
40 years of Knicks’ history, I’ve decided it’s time to step away
to spend time with my wonderful wife, Maureen, my three
beautiful daughters and my four grandchildren,” Andariese, 74,
said in a statement.  Andariese also will continue to focus on his role as chief
executive officer of TVi Media LLC, a New York-based advertising
sales company, he said.  A basketball player at Fordham University from 1956 to
1960, Andariese, nicknamed “Johnny Hoops,” has been a radio
voice of the Knicks since 1998. He began working on the team’s
radio broadcasts in 1972 and for 12 years was a television
analyst for the Knicks, through the 1997-98 season. He was also
a college basketball analyst for NBC, worked on ESPN’s “The NBA
Tonight” show, and for two years was a color analyst on TBS.  Andariese still will occasionally contribute to Knicks’
radio coverage, Daniel Ronayne, executive vice president and
general manager of MSG Networks, said in the statement.  MSG placed Andariese on  administrative leave  during the
1999-2000 season for violating a company policy on reselling
tickets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
