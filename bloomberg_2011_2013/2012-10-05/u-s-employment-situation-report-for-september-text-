Following is the text of the
September employment report from the Labor Department.  The unemployment rate decreased to 7.8 percent in September,
and total nonfarm payroll employment rose by 114,000, the  U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. Employment increased
in health care and in transportation and warehousing but changed
little in most other major industries.  Household Survey Data  The unemployment rate declined by 0.3 percentage point to
7.8 percent in September. For the first 8 months of the year,
the rate held within a narrow range of 8.1 and 8.3 percent. The
number of unemployed persons, at 12.1 million, decreased by
456,000 in September.  Among the major worker groups, the unemployment rates for
adult men (7.3 percent), adult women (7.0 percent), and whites
(7.0 percent) declined over the month. The unemployment rates
for teenagers (23.7 percent), blacks (13.4 percent), and
Hispanics (9.9 percent) were little changed. The jobless rate
for Asians, at 4.8 percent (not seasonally adjusted), fell over
the year.  In September, the number of job losers and persons who
completed temporary jobs decreased by 468,000 to 6.5 million.  The number of persons unemployed for less than 5 weeks
declined by 302,000 over the month to 2.5 million. The number of
long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was
little changed at 4.8 million and accounted for 40.1 percent of
the unemployed.  Total employment rose by 873,000 in September, following 3
months of little change. The employment-population ratio
increased by 0.4 percentage point to 58.7 percent, after edging
down in the prior 2 months. The overall trend in the employment-
population ratio for this year has been flat. The civilian  labor
force  rose by 418,000 to 155.1 million in September, while the
labor force participation rate was little changed at 63.6
percent.  The number of persons employed part time for economic
reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers)
rose from 8.0 million in August to 8.6 million in September.
These individuals were working part time because their hours had
been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time
job.  In September, 2.5 million persons were marginally attached
to the labor force, essentially unchanged from a year earlier.
(These data are not seasonally adjusted.) These individuals were
not in the labor force, wanted and were available for work, and
had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months. They were
not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work
in the 4 weeks preceding the survey.  Among the marginally attached, there were 802,000
discouraged workers in September, a decline of 235,000 from a
year earlier. (These data are not seasonally adjusted.)
Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work
because they believe no jobs are available for them. The
remaining 1.7 million persons marginally attached to the labor
force in September had not searched for work in the 4 weeks
preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or
family responsibilities.  Establishment Survey Data  Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 114,000 in
September. In 2012, employment growth has averaged 146,000 per
month, compared with an average monthly gain of 153,000 in 2011.
In September, employment rose in health care and in
transportation and warehousing.  Health care added 44,000 jobs in September. Job gains
continued in ambulatory health care services (+30,000) and
hospitals (+8,000). Over the past year, employment in health
care has risen by 295,000.  In September, employment increased by 17,000 in
transportation and warehousing. Within the industry, there were
job gains in transit and ground passenger transportation
(+9,000) and in warehousing and storage (+4,000).  Employment in financial activities edged up in September
(+13,000), reflecting modest job growth in credit intermediation
(+6,000) and real estate (+7,000).  Manufacturing employment edged down in September (-16,000).
On net, manufacturing employment has been unchanged since April.
In September, job losses occurred in computer and electronic
products (-6,000) and in printing and related activities (-
3,000).  Employment in other major industries, including mining and
logging, construction, wholesale trade, retail trade,
information, professional and business services, leisure and
hospitality, and government, showed little change over the month.  The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm
payrolls edged up by 0.1 hour to 34.5 hours in September. The
manufacturing workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.6 hours, and
