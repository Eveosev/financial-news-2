Turkish bond  yields  fell for the
first time in three days on bets the violence on the Syrian
border that killed five people two days ago will not escalate.
The lira gained.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt slid four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.57 percent at the close in
Istanbul. The lira appreciated for a second day, trading 0.2
percent stronger at 1.7949 per dollar.  Turkey  fired into Syrian territory in retaliation against
shelling by its neighbor. The lira weakened as much as 0.4
percent in its biggest depreciation since May and bond yields
climbed as high as 18 basis points in intraday trade yesterday
as tension escalated. Deputy premier Besir Atalay said  Syria  has
conveyed regrets and assurances to United Nations officials that
such an incident won’t be repeated. “Turkey’s message has been
received,” Foreign Minister  Ahmet Davutoglu  said.  “The bond yields had made a movement on the pretext of
tensions with Syria and they are now recovering because it was
understood that this would not be a permanent problem,” Bora Tamer Yilmaz, a vice president at Halk Securities in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  Turkey’s central bank lent 6.5 billion liras ($3.6 billion)
in its one-week repo auction at the lowest 5.75 percent policy
rate today. The bank has cut the  average cost of funding  to 5.75
percent as of Oct. 4, the least since November 2011, by
providing liquidity at the lowest rate since June 4.  To contact the reporters on this story:
