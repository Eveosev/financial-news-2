Northern Ireland police said a
“substantial, viable” bomb was defused by the British Army in
Ardoyne, a Catholic district of north  Belfast , late yesterday.  “There is no doubt this device was intended to murder,”
Andrew Freeburn, the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s
commander for north Belfast, said in a recorded message. “This
is a residential area. We could have been looking at a serious
tragedy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
