Euro zone  nations that have
“significant” gold holdings should use bullion as collateral
for sovereign debt issuance to reduce bond yields, the World
Gold Council proposed.  The council commissioned Europe Economics to “challenge
and assess the merits of its proposals relative to other
suggested monetary policy tools, such as the  European Central
Bank ’s Outright Monetary Transactions program,” the
organization said in a report on its website.  “The paper assesses the council’s proposals on gold as
collateral for euro zone sovereign debt, especially in the case
of Italy and Portugal,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
