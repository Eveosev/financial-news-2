Mexico  President-elect Enrique Pena
Nieto should avoid changing the constitution as part of his
energy bill when he takes office, Ricardo Aldana, treasurer of
Petroleos Mexicanos’s union and a congressman, said.  “I think that a workable approach is to seek mechanisms
that won’t disrupt the constitution,” Aldana said today in an
interview in Mexico City.“We need to see how far we can get
without touching the constitution.”  Mexico’s constitution bans private companies from owning
oil and gas fields or refining oil.  Pena Nieto’s team is seeking ways to open up Mexico’s
energy industry without amending the constitution, Ildefonso Guajardo, an economic adviser on the team, said in an Oct. 3
interview.  Pena Nieto wants to break Pemex’s monopoly on refining and
exploration and is conducting “a technical analysis of how far
we can get without a constitutional change” that will need a
two-thirds congressional majority, Guajardo said.  In a second phase of reforms, constitutional changes may be
more feasible, said Aldana, who is a member of Pena Nieto’s
party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party. “All depends on
what’s required and how far they want to get with the changes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
