U.S. sales of structured notes linked
to commodities have plunged 41 percent this year, led by a drop-
off in securities tied to copper, an industrial metal viewed as
an economic barometer.  Issuance of commodity-linked notes fell to $2.04 billion
during the first nine months, down 97 percent from $3.44 billion
during the year-earlier period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. $7.9 million of the securities were linked to copper
this year, down from $261.6 million of volume tied to the metal
in the first three quarters of 2011.  Investors were concerned that the price of copper would
slump with lowered growth forecasts for  China , the world’s
second-largest economy and source of about 40 percent of demand
for the metal, said Michael Gayed, chief investment strategist
at Pension Partners LLC in  New York . Copper inventories at
bonded warehouses in  Shanghai  probably climbed to a record
650,000 metric tons last month, according to estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  “China has lagged in terms of stimulus,” Gayed said in a
telephone interview, referring to efforts to boost growth amid a
drop in manufacturing and fewer exports to  Europe . The  Asian
Development Bank  cut its forecast for Chinese economic growth to
7.7 percent this year from a previous estimate of 8.2 percent.  Total U.S. issuance of notes tied to metals excluding gold
fell to $87.5 million in 2012 from $640.7 million a year
earlier.  Sales of gold-linked securities surged to $723.4 million
from $316.8 million, Bloomberg data show. The spot price of gold
has risen about 3 percent to $1,787 an ounce since the  Federal
Reserve  said on Sept. 13 that it would begin a third round of
so-called quantitative easing.  Biggest Sales Decline  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  had the largest decline in issuance of
commodity-tied notes in the U.S. this year, selling $19.1
million of the securities, or 95 percent less. UBS AG had the
biggest gain, issuing $149.5 million of notes in 30 offerings,
more than 17 times its year-earlier total.  Barclays Plc sold the largest note in 2012 on Sept. 28,
$143.2 million of one-year securities tied to the price of gold.
Svensk Exportkredit AB issued last year’s biggest note on Jan.
19, $94.9 million of 14-month securities tied to the price of
copper.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  sold $7.9 million of the only  note 
this year linked to copper on Jan. 4. The note pays twice the
gains of the spot price of the commodity to 28.45 percent with
90 percent of capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank
distributed the note for a 2 percent fee.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
