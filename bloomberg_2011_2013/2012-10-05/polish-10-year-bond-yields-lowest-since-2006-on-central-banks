Polish 10-year bond yields dropped to
the lowest since 2006 and the zloty advanced after the  European
Central Bank  and the  Federal Reserve  signaled they will continue
to support economic growth, boosting appeal of riskier assets.  The yield on 10-year notes declined six basis points to
4.67 percent as of 5:37 p.m. in Warsaw, the lowest since March
2006 and down 122 basis points, or 1.22 percentage point, so far
this year. The zloty gained 0.3 percent to 4.0688 per euro,
extending this week’s advance to 1.2 percent, the steepest gain
among more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The ECB yesterday reiterated it stands ready to start
buying bonds as soon as the necessary conditions are fulfilled
while Fed policy makers said they may be able to change the size
of the central bank’s monthly asset purchases. A report today
showing an unexpected drop in the U.S. jobless rate boosted
confidence in the world’s largest economy and sent emerging-
market stocks to a two-week high.  “There is the risk-on backdrop for  emerging markets  which
tends to provide support to the long end of curves,”  Benoit Anne , head of emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA,
wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Foreign buyers of Polish bonds are “stable” investors
including central banks from Asia and the  Middle East , Deputy
Finance Minister Wojciech Kowalczyk told Rzeczpospolita
newspaper in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
