Money-market indicators showed the
level of stress in short-term euro funding held near the lowest
since 2007.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was
little changed at 13.2 basis points, or 0.132 percentage point,
at 8:20 a.m. in  London , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The measure reached a five-year low of 12.8 basis points on Oct.
1.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars held near
the lowest in more than a week. The three-month cross-currency
 basis swap  was 23 basis points below Euribor, the cheapest since
Sept. 25. The one-year basis swap was 24.5 basis points below
Euribor from minus 25 yesterday.  The European Banking Federationâ€™s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.095
percent yesterday from 0.085 percent the day before. The  volume 
of overnight lending as measured by the EBF in Brussels rose to
24.6 billion euros ($32 billion) of transactions yesterday, from
10 billion euros the day before.  The Eonia swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing
costs over the next three months, was 8.5 basis points from 8.7
yesterday. Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European
Central Bank yesterday to the lowest since December 2011,
placing 278 billion euros ($361 billion) with the Frankfurt-
based central bank from 279 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
