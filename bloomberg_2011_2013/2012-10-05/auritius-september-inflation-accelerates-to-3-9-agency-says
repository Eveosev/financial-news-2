Mauritius’s annual inflation rate
rose to its highest level since February, led by increased costs
for vegetables and other goods and services, Statistics
Mauritius said.  Inflation accelerated to 3.9 percent in September from 3.7
percent a month earlier, the Port Louis-based agency said in a
statement on its website today. Prices rose 0.1 percent during
the month.  The average inflation rate for the 12 months through
September, a measure used to determine annual wages, declined to
4.4 percent from 4.6 percent in August, it said.  Mauritius’s central bank left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 4.9 percent for a second consecutive meeting last
month, citing risks that domestic inflation may accelerate
because of higher global food and energy prices. The $10 billion
Indian Ocean island economy is a net importer of food and fuels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
