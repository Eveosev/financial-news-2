Oil headed for a third weekly decline
in  New York  on speculation the biggest gain in two months
yesterday was exaggerated amid rising supplies.  Futures slid as much as 0.6 percent after surging 4.1
percent yesterday on concern tension between Turkey and  Syria 
will disrupt  Middle East  output.  Saudi Arabia , OPEC’s biggest
crude producer, sees no difficulty in meeting demand, according
to Oil Minister  Ali al-Naimi . Investors are awaiting a report
today which may show the U.S. jobless rate increased last month
even as employment growth accelerated.  “The situation with the oil market is that current and
forecast future demand levels over the next 12 months are well
covered by supply and that’s been the driving factor behind the
decline we’re seeing in recent weeks,” said Ric Spooner, a
chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney. “I don’t think
the markets are likely to come out of tonight’s employment
figure with a significantly altered view of oil demand.”  Crude for November delivery fell as much as 55 cents to
$91.16 a barrel and was at $91.24 in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:02 p.m. in Tokyo. The contract
rose $3.57 to $91.71 yesterday. Prices are down 1 percent this
week, for the longest run of weekly declines since June, and 7.7
percent this year.  Turkey-Syria Tension  Brent oil for November settlement slipped 43 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $112.15 after advancing $4.41 yesterday on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
crude was at a premium of $20.91 to New York-traded West Texas
Intermediate grade.  Oil in New York has long-term technical support at $89.83 a
barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. On the weekly
chart, that’s the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop
to $32.40 in December 2008 from an intraday record high of
$147.27 in July that year. Buy orders tend to be clustered near
chart-support levels.  Prices surged yesterday as Turkey’s parliament authorized
the government to order military action in Syria after a mortar
bomb fired across the border on Oct. 3 killed five Turks. The
decision highlights the risk that neighboring countries may be
drawn into Syria’s civil war. Countries in the Middle East and
North Africa were responsible for 36 percent of global oil
production and held 52 percent of proved reserves in 2011,
according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  Fuel Prices  Crude also gained yesterday amid a surge in futures for
fuel. Gasoline jumped 5.1 percent to $2.9429 a gallon and
heating oil climbed 4 percent to $3.1884. The motor fuel was at
$2.9328 today, the highest level on this date since at least
2005, the earliest year for which data compiled by Bloomberg is
available.  The spread between heating oil and crude contracts in New
York was at $41.80 a barrel today after climbing 3.8 percent to
$42.20 yesterday, its highest level since July 1986. The
difference, or so-called crack, is measure of refiners’ profits
from producing the fuel.  “If the cracks are so good and people start ramping up
refinery runs, people will start buying crude and drawing down
crude stockpiles,” said  Anthony Nunan , a senior adviser for
risk management at  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  in Tokyo.  Oil prices  may slide next week as U.S. production rises, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Twenty-one of 38 analysts, or 55
percent, forecast WTI will drop through Oct. 12. Thirteen
respondents, or 34 percent, predicted it will gain and four saw
little change.  U.S. crude output rose to 6.52 million barrels a
day last week, the most since December 1996, an Energy
Department report on Oct. 3 showed.  ‘Very High’  Oil prices have been “very high” this year even with an
economic slowdown in many countries and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries is helping to keep them under
control, al-Naimi said yesterday in Ankara,  Turkey .  Crude is on course for its strongest second half of the
year on record, according to the median of 26 analyst estimates
tracked by Bloomberg. WTI will cost $94.50 a barrel in New York
this quarter, up from $92.20 in the previous three months, the
predictions show. The previous highest level for any second half
was $91.78 a barrel, in 2011.  U.S. unemployment increased to 8.2 percent last month from
8.1 percent in August, according to the median projection of 88
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before today’s Labor Department
report. Payrolls climbed by 115,000 workers, up from 96,000 the
prior month though less than the 139,000 average over the first
eight months of the year, the report may also show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
