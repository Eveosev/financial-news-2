U.S. stocks advanced, snapping a two-
week decline for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, amid better-
than-estimated economic reports and after the European Central
Bank said it stands ready to start buying government bonds.  The  S&P 500  reversed a rally in the week’s final session,
as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  slumped and optimism over the government’s monthly
jobs report faded.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
added more than 5.5 percent during the week.  MetroPCS (PCS) 
Communications Inc. climbed 8 percent as Deutsche Telekom AG
agreed to combine its T-Mobile USA unit with the company.
 Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  soared 22 percent as an analyst said the video-
subscription service has improved customer satisfaction.  The S&P 500 added 1.4 percent to 1,460.93, after slumping
1.7 percent in the previous  two weeks . The Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed 173.02 points, or 1.3 percent, to 13,610.15. The
30-stock gauge rose to the highest level since December 2007.  “The trajectory is positive,” said  Quincy Krosby , a
market strategist for Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential
Financial Inc., which oversees $961 billion. “We’ve had
economic numbers that are better. We’ve had more reinforcement
that the ECB stands ready to buy bonds. As we get into the
earnings season, corporate guidance is going to be crucial.”  Equities rebounded from the biggest weekly drop since June
on better-than-forecast factory orders and manufacturing data.
The unemployment rate in the U.S. unexpectedly fell to 7.8
percent in September, the lowest since President Barack Obama
took office in January 2009. ECB President Mario Draghi said the
central bank is ready to undertake bond purchases “once all the
prerequisites are in place.”  Earnings Season  Investors will be able to gauge the health of U.S.
corporations as  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  unofficially starts the earnings
season with the release of its third-quarter numbers on Oct. 9.
The streak of 11 quarters of profit growth in S&P 500 companies
is projected to end as analysts estimate a decline of 1.7
percent in earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The earnings season is critical on two points,” said
 Alan Gayle , a senior strategist at RidgeWorth Capital Management
in Richmond, Virginia, which oversees about $47 billion. He
spoke in a phone interview. “The first is: how much has the
global slowdown impacted earnings? The next thing I expect
earnings to do is give us guidance on 2013.”  Better-than-estimated  earnings  and speculation on central
bank stimulus action have helped drive a 14 percent gain in the
S&P 500 since June 1. The rally put the index close to its all-
time high of 1,565.15 set in October 2007. The S&P 500 needs to
rise 7.1 percent to reach that level.  Economic Optimism  Bets that the economic recovery won’t be derailed took the
Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to growth
up 2.3 percent for the week. Nine out of  10 groups  in the  S&P
500 (SPX)  rose as financial companies had the biggest gain. The  KBW
Bank Index (BKX)  jumped 3.7 percent. Citigroup increased 6.3 percent
to $34.77. Bank of America added 5.6 percent to $9.32.  MetroPCS Communications rallied 8 percent to $12.65.
Germany’s largest phone company will own 74 percent of a new
U.S. mobile operator and MetroPCS shareholders will get $1.5
billion in cash, the companies said.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  is in
the early stages of evaluating a bid for MetroPCS that would
counter the offer from Deutsche Telekom, three people familiar
with the situation said. Sprint fell 5.8 percent to $5.20 for
the week.  Netflix jumped 22 percent to $66.56. The company has
grappled with customer-satisfaction issues since increasing
prices in 2011 for users who both stream videos and get DVDs by
mail and an attempt that year to separate those offerings. A
Citigroup survey last month found that 48 percent of customers
are “very or extremely satisfied,” compared with about 45
percent in the first and second quarter.  ‘Evaluating Opportunities’  Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR)  climbed 8.9 percent to $58.45. The
petroleum  company  said it’s “evaluating opportunities” after
meeting with investors including Third Point LLC, which is
calling for divestitures that it says could raise as much as
$8.4 billion.  Technology companies, which comprise 20 percent of the S&P
500, had the only decline among 10 industries. The measure of 70
companies fell 0.2 percent for the week. Apple, the world’s most
valuable company, lost 2.2 percent to $652.59, falling below its
average price from the past 50 days.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  plunged 14 percent to $14.73, the
lowest since 2002. Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman  forecast
2013 profit that missed estimates and said a turnaround at the
computer maker won’t happen any time soon.  ‘It’s Brutal’  Whitman, one year into her tenure leading the world’s
largest PC maker, said that the company lacks a “sharp,
competitive focus” and needs to concentrate on fewer products.
Hewlett-Packard is trying to boost profit by cutting jobs and
reviving sales with multi-featured machines, including printers
that double as scanners and copiers, as well as servers that
combine computing, storage and networking.  “It’s brutal -- it’s really, really negative,”  Brian Marshall , an analyst at ISI Group, said in an interview.
“They’ve been very transparent. The problem with transparency
is when they open up the full picture, it’s pretty ugly.”  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG)  slumped 12 percent to $280.93
after hedge fund manager  David Einhorn  recommended selling the
stock short during a presentation. Einhorn, head of Greenlight
Capital Inc., said that Chipotle has too high of a valuation and
will face challenges from  Yum! Brands Inc.’s (YUM)  Taco Bell chain.  Chipotle’s price-earnings ratio is 34, compared with 20 for
the S&P 500 Restaurants Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The shares have soared in recent years, reaching an
intraday record of $442.40 in April after ending 2008 at $61.98.
Short selling refers to the practice of borrowing stock and
selling it, with the goal of profiting by repurchasing the
shares later at a lower price.  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA)  tumbled 13 percent to $2.48, the lowest price
since the company went public in December. The game maker cut
its forecast for full-year bookings, a predictor of sales,
citing lower demand for titles such as “The Ville.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
