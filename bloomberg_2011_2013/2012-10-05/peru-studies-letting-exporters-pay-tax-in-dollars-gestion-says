Peruâ€™s government is studying a
request from exporters for permission to pay some taxes in
dollars as an appreciating sol erodes incomes, Gestion  reported .  Should the request be approved, it will only apply to non-
commodity exporters, the Lima-based newspaper reported, citing

dollars to repay debt, Gestion said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
