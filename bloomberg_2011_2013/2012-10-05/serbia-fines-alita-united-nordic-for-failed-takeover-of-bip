Serbia ’s asset sale authority said
Alita AB, a Lithuaninan distiller, and  United Nordic Beverages
AB  were fined 16.9 million euros ($22 million) for their failed
takeover of Beogradska Industrija Piva.  An arbitration panel of the  Serbian Chamber of Commerce 
found the two must pay 5.1 million euros they promised to invest
in the Belgrade-based brewery, plus 1.95 percent annual interest
since Feb. 16, 2010, as well as 11.75 million euros for bringing
the  beverage maker  to bankruptcy, Serbia’s  Privatization Agency 
said in an e-mailed statement.  The 2007 purchase of a 51.9 percent stake in Beogradska
Industrija, also known as BIP, for 21.4 million euros plus 5.1
million euros as pledged investment over three years, was
canceled in 2010. The Agency said Alita and Nordic also have to
pay the 23.55 million dinar ($266,600) cost of arbitration.
