Russia , the world’s third-biggest
wheat exporter last season, may see its grain crop fall 26
percent year-on-year to less than 70 million metric tons due to
lower yields after drought damage,  SovEcon  said.  The wheat crop after drying and cleaning may reach 38
million tons, Moscow-based researcher SovEcon said on its
website today. That compares with 56.2 million tons of wheat and
94.2 million tons of grain, in the previous season, according to
state statistics data.  Farmers have harvested 67.5 million tons of grains from the
start of the campaign on June 15 through Oct. 2, SovEcon said,
citing Agriculture Ministry data. That compares with 87.6
million tons a year earlier, it said. Yields dropped to 1.85
tons a hectare (2.47 acres) from 2.31 tons a year earlier, the
researcher said.  Arkady Zlochevsky, the Grain Union president, said
yesterday farmers may keep about 5 million tons of grains from
official statistics in order to secure compensation payments for
the impact of drought, bringing the total crop to an estimated
77 million to 78 million tons for the 2012-13 season.  SovEcon maintained its crop figure and said unofficial
grain that may be kept out of statistics will be used by
livestock and poultry holders, whose animals are also beyond the
government’s records.  This year’s drought damaged crops, prompting 20 of Russia’s
83 regions to declare a state of emergency and causing 19.6
billion rubles ($630 million) of damage, the  Agriculture
Ministry  said last month.  Wheat shipments may decline to 8 million tons this
marketing year from 21.6 million tons in the previous period,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. That
would make Russia the fifth biggest shipper after U.S.,
 Australia ,  Canada  and the European Union.  Wheat for December delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $8.665 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 11:47 a.m. London time.
It’s advanced 33 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
