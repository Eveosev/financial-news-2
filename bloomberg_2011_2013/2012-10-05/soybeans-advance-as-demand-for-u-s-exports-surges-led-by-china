Soybeans climbed for a third day as
U.S. export sales jumped, boosted by purchases from  China .  The contract for delivery in November rose as much as 0.5
percent to $15.5875 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures were at $15.5375 at 2:10 p.m. Singapore time, trimming
the weekly loss to 3 percent, the third such decline.  Sales soared 62 percent to 1.297 million metric tons in the
week to Sept. 27, with China buying about 79 percent, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. That’s the highest
weekly sales for delivery in the current marketing year since
November 2010, according to USDA data. The country is set to be
the biggest shipper after Brazil this year.  “Buyers took advantage of the recent slide in prices,”
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , said in a report today. “Oilseed prices were also
supported by Stats Canada which cut canola production.”  Output of canola will fall 7.8 percent from last year to
13.4 million tons,  Statistics Canada  said yesterday.  Corn for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent to $7.5575 a
bushel, while wheat for delivery in the same month was little
changed at $8.69 a bushel.  Exporters in the U.S. sold 326,917 tons of corn in the week
to Sept. 27 for delivery in this marketing year, up from 368
tons a week earlier, the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
