Ruckus Wireless Inc., a maker of
wireless-networking equipment, filed to raise $100 million in a
U.S. initial public offering.  The company hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  to manage the deal, according to a  regulatory filing 
today. The $100 million amount is a placeholder used to
calculate fees and may change. The company didn’t specify the
number of shares or  price range  for the IPO in the filing.  Ruckus, based in Sunnyvale, California, is a leader in the
market for gear that lets phone companies shunt data traffic
from overcrowded cellular networks onto higher-capacity Wi-Fi
networks. Carriers are using Ruckus’s small networking devices
that can be placed on telephone poles, street lights or roofs to
relieve networks swamped by data traffic from smartphones.  Chief Executive Officer Selina Lo said in April the company
would like to try to go public this year.  Revenue nearly doubled in the first half of 2012 to $93.9
million. Net income in the six months through June was $24.4
million, compared with a loss of $862,000 in the year-earlier
period.  The company said it has no specific plans for the proceeds
from the offering, and may use them for acquisitions and general
corporate purposes including sales and marketing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
