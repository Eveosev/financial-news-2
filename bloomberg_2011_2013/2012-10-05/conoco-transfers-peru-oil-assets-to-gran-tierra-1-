ConocoPhillips (COP)  is pulling out of two
exploration areas in the Peruvian Amazon jungle as it divests
assets to focus on new European and U.S. ventures.  Conoco will transfer its 45 percent stake in Blocks 123 and
129 to Calgary-based  Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (GTE) , it said in a
statement today. The transfer won’t involve a financial
transaction, Davy Kong, a spokesman for Houston-based Conoco,
said in a telephone interview.  “It was a difficult decision to leave these blocks,”
Larry Archibald, vice president for exploration, said in the
statement. “We reached this decision as part of the company’s
broader strategic effort to re-evaluate our investments and
asset portfolio.”  Conoco is divesting assets with high-capital needs to focus
on new ventures, Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said last
month. The company may use asset sales to fund spending as it
invests $2.5 billion in Texas’s Eagle Ford shale formation and
$2.2 billion in new European projects this year, he said.  Conoco joins Calgary-based  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  and Spain’s
Repsol SA, which are also looking to shed their Peruvian
operations.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  said Sept. 5 it’s reviewing
its investments in a natural gas block.  Conoco rose 0.3 percent to $57.58 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
