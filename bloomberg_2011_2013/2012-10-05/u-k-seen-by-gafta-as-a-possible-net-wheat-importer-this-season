The U.K. may be a net importer of
wheat this season, after the wettest summer in a century cut
yields and eroded the quality of crops, said Patrick Savage, the
president of the Grain and Feed Trade Association.  U.K. exports may be about 500,000 metric tons, with most
shipments consisting of lower-quality feed grains, Savage said
today in an interview at the 52nd European Commodities Exchange
in Edinburgh. Imports may be as much as 2 million tons, he said.
During the 2011-12 season, the U.K. was a net-exporter of wheat,
with shipments totaling 2.39 million tons and imports of 867,170
tons, customs data show.  June, July and August were the wettest in the U.K. since
1912, according to the  Met Office . Grain weights, which can
affect flour extraction, have been the lowest since 1977, the
Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board said Sept. 21.  “The millers are the ones that are suffering most, and
they’ll have to import more,” Savage said.  The U.K. harvest may be about 13.5 million tons, Savage
said. Brussels-based grain lobby Coceral pegged the country’s
crop at 13.6 million tons on Sept. 28, down from 15.3 million a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
