Dow Chemical Co., the biggest U.S.
chemical company, was sued by a unit of  Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA) , the
world’s largest paintmaker, over a patent for a high-temperature
coatings process.  Akzo, based in Amsterdam, contends Midland, Michigan-based
Dow is wrongly using polymer extrusion technology patented in
2004, according to a complaint filed yesterday in federal court
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Akzo deserves “damages, along with permanent injunctive
relief” following a  jury trial , for Dow’s patent infringement,
the plaintiff’s lawyers said in court papers.  The lawsuit targets Dow Chemical’s so-called Bluewave
Process used to make paint, and glass, paper and textile
coatings, Akzo lawyers said in court papers.  Dow spokeswoman Nancy Lamb said the company hasn’t been
served with the complaint and had no immediate comment on the
lawsuit.  The case is Akzo Nobel Coatings Inc. v.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) ,
12-cv-1264, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patent in the lawsuit, click: 6,767,956.  To contact the reporter on this story:
