Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s biggest exporter
of consumer electronics, suspended sales of a tablet computer
that was introduced last month, citing a water-proofing defect.  The electronics maker told customers on its  website  today
that it’s halting sales of the Xperia Tablet S and will offer
free repairs, Noriko Shoji, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo-based
company, said by phone today. Sony will offer repairs in regions
where the device is available, including the U.S.,  Canada ,
Europe, Oceania and Taiwan, Shoji said.  The product is among Sony’s new releases targeted at year-
end shopping demand. High water resistance was among the
device’s selling points, Sony said in a statement last month.
The tablet has been offered in three models with different
storage capacities since Sept 15.  Sony rose 2.8 percent to 948 yen as of the close in Tokyo
trading after the announcement, paring its  decline this year  to
31 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
