Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average gaining a second day, after European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  said it stands ready to buy bonds
and as U.S. economic data beat expectations.  Brother Industries Ltd. (6448) , an office-equipment company that
gets almost 30 percent of its sales in Europe, climbed 2.5
percent. Funai Electric Co., a maker of audio-visual equipment
that relies on North America for half its revenue, jumped 3.8
percent on U.S. jobless claims and factory orders that beat
expectations.  EAccess Ltd. (9427) , a telecom that is being bought by
Softbank Corp. soared 42 percent after the trading limit on the
stock was lifted. The shares rose 212 percent this week.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.4 percent to 8,863.30 at the 3 p.m.
close, paring a weekly drop of 0.1 percent, its third week of
declines. The gauge fell as much as 0.2 percent earlier today
after the Bank of Japan refrained from adding to last month’s
stimulus. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index added 0.2 percent to 737.13,
with almost two shares rising for each that fell.  “Draghi’s remarks reduced uncertainty in the market and
the U.S. data shows the economy isn’t deteriorating, fueling
confidence among investors,” said  Ayako Sera , a market
strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has 33
trillion yen ($421 billion) in assets. “Market expectations for
more easing by the BOJ were unexpectedly strong. It’s a mystery
why investors were looking for more stimulus even after the
central bank eased policy last month.”  Shares earlier reversed gains after the BOJ kept its asset-
purchase fund, the main policy tool amid near-zero rates, at 55
trillion yen ($700 billion), the bank said in a statement in
 Tokyo  today. The outcome was predicted by all 20 economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  The yen strengthened versus most of its 16 major
counterparts and pared a weekly decline versus the dollar, after
the BOJ stimulus at the conclusion of a meeting today.  The Topix has risen 2.5 percent since Sept. 6, after the
ECB started a global wave of easing to curb a slowdown in
growth, with the U.S.  Federal Reserve  and the  Bank of Japan  also
adding stimulus measures. The price of shares on the Topix stood
at 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.3 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx
600 Index. A number less than one means that companies can be
bought for less than the value of their assets.  Stocks gained after the ECB’sDraghi said the central bank
is ready to start buying government bonds of indebted euro
nations as soon as the necessary conditions are fulfilled. The
ECB yesterday kept its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at a
historic low of 0.75 percent.  Brother Industries advanced 2.5 percent to 733 yen. Nippon
Sheet Glass Co., which generates about 40 percent of its sales
in Europe, climbed 3.3 percent to 62 yen.  Draghi’s Stance  “Although Draghi is just reiterating the ECB’s stance to
support debt-burdened countries, the market is responding
positively to his remarks,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-
based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which
oversees about $70 billion. “The U.S. data shows the economy is
on more solid ground, with factory orders beating estimates.
Even though the  U.S. economy  isn’t recovering across the board,
more investors are optimistic.”  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  added 0.1 percent today. The index
rose 0.7 percent in New York yesterday after the Labor
Department said applications for jobless benefits rose 4,000 to
367,000 in the week ended Sept. 29, beating expectations of
370,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey.  Orders placed with U.S. factories fell 5.2 percent in
August, the Commerce Department said, short of a 5.9 percent
decline projected by economists polled by Bloomberg survey.  U.S. Jobs  A government report today is expected to show the world’s
biggest economy created 115,000 jobs last month and the
 unemployment rate  rose to 8.2 percent from 8.1 percent,
economists estimated. The Federal Reserve in September pledged
to buy mortgage-backed securities until the U.S. labor market
recovers.  Funai Electric jumped 3.8 percent to 1,006 yen. Toyo Tire &
Rubber Co., which gets a third of its sales in  North America ,
climbed 2.1 percent to 194 yen.  EAccess surged 42 percent to 47,000 yen, rising for a fifth
day, after Softbank, Japan’s third-biggest mobile carrier, said
on Oct. 1 it will acquire eAccess for $2.3 billion, three times
the company’s market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
