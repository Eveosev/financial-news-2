Pioneer Corp. (6773) , a Japanese car-
navigation systems maker, had a loss in the first half because
of a charge to reflect a drop in the value of its holdings in
 Sharp Corp. (6753)   The net loss was about 4.83 billion yen ($61.6 million) in
the six months ended Sept. 30, compared with a  previous estimate 
of a 1 billion yen profit, the Kawasaki, Japan-based company
 said  in a preliminary earnings statement today. It booked a
charge of 5.83 billion yen on the decline in Sharpâ€™s market
value, spokesman Hiromitsu Kimura said by phone. Pioneer also
scrapped plans to pay a first-half  dividend .  Sharp, which formed an equity partnership with Pioneer in
2007, fell 52 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30, as it
forecast a second straight annual  loss . Pioneer has a 0.9
percent  stake  in Sharp, while Sharp has a 9.2 percent stake in
Pioneer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Osaka-based Sharp plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs and
sell overseas plants as well as U.S. solar developer Recurrent
Energy LLC in an attempt to return to profit next fiscal year,
people with knowledge of the plans said last month.  Pioneer was unchanged at 170 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange before the company announced its preliminary earnings.
The stock has  declined 51 percent  this year, compared with a 4.8
percent gain in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
