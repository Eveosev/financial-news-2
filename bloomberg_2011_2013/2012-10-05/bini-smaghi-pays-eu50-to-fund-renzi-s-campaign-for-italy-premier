Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi paid 50 euros ($65.3)
to fund Florence Mayor Matteo Renzi’s campaign for the
leadership of  Italy ’s Democratic Party before the elections due
by April of next year.  The contribution of Bini Smaghi, a Florence native, was
included in a list posted today on the official  website  of
Renzi’s campaign, which said it had permission to publish the
names. Renzi’s spokeswoman Antonella Madeo confirmed the
donation by e-mail. The list also included 100 euros paid by
Gaddo della Gherardesca, former partner of the Duchess of York,
Sarah Ferguson. Bini Smaghi declined to comment in an e-mail
responding to a question about the donation.  Renzi announced last month that he’ll challenge Pier Luigi Bersani, head of the Democratic Party, in a primary before the
elections, in a bid to become the country’s next prime minister.
The leadership challenge comes as the Democratic Party leads in
most opinion polls.  On Sept. 27 unelected Prime Minister Mario Monti said that
while he won’t run in the elections next year, he remains
available to serve another term should the need arise.  -- With assistance from Gabi Thesing in  London . Editors: Andrew Davis, Jim Silver  To contact the reporters on this story:
