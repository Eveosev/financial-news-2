Canadian oils on the  spot market 
weakened to the lowest levels in more than a month as refineries
in  Canada  and the U.S. Midwest that process the crude begin
planned maintenance.  HollyFrontier Corp. (HFC) ’s 90,000-barrel-a-day Tulsa West
refinery in  Oklahoma  will begin a turnaround soon, said Julia
Heidenreich, a Dallas-based spokeswoman. The plant will be idled
for about five weeks, a person with knowledge of the repairs
said June 28.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  will shut units Oct. 8 at its 137,000-
barrel-a-day Montreal refinery in  Quebec  for three weeks of
maintenance, the company said in a notice posted on an industry
website.  Western Canada Select’s  discount  to West Texas Intermediate
widened $3 to $14.75 a barrel at 4:10 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the weakest the
discount has been since Aug. 31.  Syncrude’s  premium  to WTI fell $3.50 to $5.75 a barrel, the
smallest since Aug. 31.  Nexen Inc. (NXY) ’s Long Lake upgrader was
expected to resume making synthetic crude by the end of this
week after being down for planned maintenance, Patti Lewis, a
Calgary-based spokeswoman, said in an Oct. 2 e-mail.  Bakken oil’s  premium  narrowed by $1.50 to $2.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
