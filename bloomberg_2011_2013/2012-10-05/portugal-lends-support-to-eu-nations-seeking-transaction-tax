Portugal and Slovenia joined efforts
by four other nations to adopt a financial-transaction tax among
a subset of European Union nations, EU spokeswoman Emer Traynor
said today.  The Brussels-based commission is ready to move quickly once
it receives requests from three additional countries, Traynor
said in a text message. France and  Germany  sent a letter to
begin the process on Sept. 28, followed this week by Austria and
 Belgium .  EU finance ministers are slated to discuss the state of
play on financial transaction tax proposals during an Oct. 9
meeting in Luxembourg.  Nine countries must sign on for the commission to begin
designing a transaction tax under the EU’s “enhanced
cooperation” procedures. In June, EU finance ministers cleared
the way for a smaller group of countries to proceed after it
became evident there would not be unanimous support for an
agreement among all 27 countries in the bloc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
