West Indies reached the final of
cricket’s World Twenty20 in  Sri Lanka  by handing Australia its
second-worst ever loss in the shortest form of the game.  Chris Gayle hit 75 runs from 41 balls and  Ravi Rampaul  took
3-16 to pace the Windies, which won by 74 runs in  Colombo .
Australia was all out for 131 in 16.4 overs in response to West
Indies’ 205-4. The victors will play Sri Lanka in two days.  Gayle hit 6 sixes and 5 fours, combining with Dwayne Bravo
for 83 runs. Bravo was out for 37, while  Kieron Pollard  was
caught on 38 off the last ball of the 20 overs.  West Indies, which won the toss and elected to bat, hit 14
sixes and 13 fours. Xavier Doherty took the brunt of the
batting, taking 1-48, while  Shane Watson  conceded 35 runs
without claiming a wicket.  “We did bring our A game,” West Indies Captain Darren
Sammy said. “We knew we needed that to beat Australia. It’s a
good feeling to beat Australia.”  Sri Lanka beat Pakistan yesterday in the other semifinal.
The World Twenty20, generally held every two years, is the
championship of the game’s shortest form. The winners will pick
up $1 million in prize money.  “I think this  World Cup  is going to be ours,” Gayle said.
“Sorry Sri Lanka, but it’s going to be ours. We love Sri Lanka,
but it’s West Indies all the way.”  Sri Lanka beat West Indies by 9 wickets when they played
earlier in the tournament.  Australia started its innings poorly, with Samuel Badree
bowling opening batsmen  David Warner , for 1, and Shane Warner,
on 7. Captain George Bailey tried to fight back, reaching 63
before being caught by Andre Russell off Pollard.  We were “outplayed,” Bailey said. “Full credit to West
Indies. They deserve to be playing in the final, that’s for
sure.”  Australia lost to England by 100 runs in June 2005 for its
worst result in the form of the game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
