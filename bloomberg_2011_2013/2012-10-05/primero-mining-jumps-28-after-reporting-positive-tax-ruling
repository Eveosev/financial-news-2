Primero Mining Corp. (P)  jumped the most
in more than two years after the Mexican government said it
would tax silver sold from the Canadian company’s San Dimas mine
at a lower rate.  The company  rose  36 percent to C$7.20 at the close in
Toronto, the most since June 9, 2010.  The government approved taxing sales based on the price
agreed to under the terms of a contract with  Canada ’s  Silver
Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , and not the prevailing market price, Primero said
in a statement today. The ruling applies to 2010 through 2014.  Primero will sell silver at an average of $9.41 an ounce in
2012, Tamara Brown, a spokeswoman for the Vancouver-based
company, said in an e-mail today. Silver for delivery in
December was at $34.63 an ounce at 11:07 a.m. in  Chicago .  “The ruling was unexpected,” Craig West, a Toronto-based
analyst at GMP Securities Ltd., said in an interview. “This is
a lot more fair. They were being taxed on revenue they were not
getting.”  West said the company was effectively being taxed at a rate
of 70 percent to 80 percent, whereas now the rate will drop to
30 percent. He raised his rating on the shares to buy from hold.  Under the purchase agreement, each year Silver Wheaton buys
the first 3.5 million ounces of silver from San Dimas plus half
of any extra output at $4.08 an ounce. The price will rise 1
percent annually through Aug. 6, 2014. After that date, Silver
Wheaton will get the first 6 million ounces and 50 percent of
any excess at $4.20 an ounce with a 1 percent increase each
year.  Silver Wheaton pays mining companies upfront for a discount
on future output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
