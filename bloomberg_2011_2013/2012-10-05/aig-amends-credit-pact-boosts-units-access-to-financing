American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that counts the U.S. Treasury Department as its
largest shareholder, reached agreement with lenders on an
amended credit deal that will make more financing available for
subsidiaries.  The revised 4-year deal provides a $4 billion facility,
with $2 billion of credit available to subsidiaries, New York-
based AIG said today in a statement. It replaces a $4.5 billion
facility that had a $1.5 billion letter of credit for the units.  AIG is increasing  financial flexibility  for units as
Treasury reduces its stake acquired in the firm’s bailout that
began in 2008 and swelled to $182.3 billion. The insurer spent
$5 billion to buy back U.S. shares last month in a deal that
helped cut Treasury’s stake to 16 percent.  “The terms of this credit facility are more favorable and
provide greater flexibility,” Chief Financial Officer David Herzog said in the statement.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Citigroup Inc. were the lead
arrangers, AIG said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
