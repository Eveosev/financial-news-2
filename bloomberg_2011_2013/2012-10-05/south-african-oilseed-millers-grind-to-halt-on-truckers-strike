Oilseed crushers in South Africa, the
continent’s largest producer of soybeans, stopped milling as a
two-week truckers’ strike prevented deliveries to the plants.  Soybean millers have halted output because they haven’t
received their beans, Etienne van Heerden, a grain trader at
brokerage  Farmwise Grains (Pty) Ltd. , said today by phone.
Sunflower-seed crusher Epko Oil Seed Crushing (Pty) Ltd. said
its operations have been idle for 1 1/2 weeks.  About 20,000 truck drivers are on strike as they push for a
12 percent pay increase for each of the next two years, while
employers have offered 18 percent in total, Magretia Brown-
Engelbrecht, a spokeswoman for the Road Freight Employers’
Association, said by phone today.  A third of fuel stations in Gauteng province, the country’s
commercial hub, have run out of at least one of three products,
MC Lamprecht, chairman of the Petroleum Retailers Association,
said by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
