Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
his government would convene the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and propose production cuts if  oil prices 
fall.  Chavez, speaking on state television today on the last day
of his campaigning before the Oct. 7 presidential election, said
his country would negotiate with Russia and Norway in the event
of a drop in oil prices. Chavez, who has been fighting cancer,
said he “could not be better” and that he is feeling well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
