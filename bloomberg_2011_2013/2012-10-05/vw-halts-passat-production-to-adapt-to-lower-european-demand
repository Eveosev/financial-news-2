Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s biggest
carmaker, halted production of the Passat sedan at a German
factory for two days to adapt to slower demand in Europe.  “Passat production had surpassed the planned output,” so
work was suspended at the Emden plant yesterday and today,
Christoph Adomat, a VW spokesman in Wolfsburg, said by phone.
“We do regularly adapt our production to market demand.”  VW’s sales in Europe, including the namesake brand as well
as Seat and Audi, rose 0.5 percent in the first eight months of
the year as industry sales fell 6.6 percent, according to the
 European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association . Auto sales on
the continent will probably shrink 7 percent this year, hitting
the lowest level in 17 years, according to the trade group.  Audi, VW’s premium brand, halted production this week at
its factory in Neckarsulm where A6, A7 and A8 sedans are
manufactured.  “We are acting with foresight as the demand for higher-end
cars especially in southern Europe is slowing,” Susanne Brieu,
Audi spokeswoman, said today by phone.  Audi said yesterday that September sales in  China  advanced
20 percent to 35,512 vehicles. In the first nine months, sales
were up 31 percent in the country. Audi is scheduled to release
global delivery figures on Oct. 8.  Handelsblatt reported the Passat production halt yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
