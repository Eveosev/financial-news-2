Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  will sell its
first tablet computer featuring  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Windows RT
operating system through  AT&T Inc. (T) , the Taipei-based company
said in a statement today.  Its Vivo Tab TF600 features an  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  processor and
4G-LTE connectivity, the company said, without giving the price.
The device will be available for the “holiday season,” it
said.  Microsoft will release Windows 8 and Windows RT later this
month, and Asustek will hold a product-unveiling press
conference Oct. 12 in Taipei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
