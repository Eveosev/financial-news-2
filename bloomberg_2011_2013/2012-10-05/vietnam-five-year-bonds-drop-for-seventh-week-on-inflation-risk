Vietnam’s benchmark five-year bonds
fell for a seventh week, their longest losing streak in more
than four years, on speculation inflation will accelerate. The
dong was little changed.  Consumer-price gains  may be about 7 percent by the end of
2012 and 9.4 percent by the end of 2013, the Asian Development
Bank’s Vietnam country economist Dominic Mellor said in Hanoi on
Oct. 3. Inflation was 6.48 percent in September, compared with
5.04 percent in August, official data show.  “Inflation expectations have crept up again and banks are
afraid to lock in to longer-term bonds,” said Nguyen Duc Hai, a
Ho Chi Minh City-based portfolio manager at Manulife Asset
Management. Fuel and food costs have the potential to boost
consumer prices, he said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 10.15 percent this week,
completing the longest weekly run of increases since June 2008,
according to daily fixing rates from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield was steady from yesterday.  The dong was little changed today and this week at 20,885
per dollar as of 5:06 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The State Bank of  Vietnam  set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either
side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
