Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Employment increased for the second consecutive month in
September, up 52,000, mainly in full-time work. The unemployment
rate rose 0.1 percentage points to 7.4% as more people
participated in the labour market.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was up 1.0% or
175,000, driven by an increase of 157,000 (+1.1%) in full-time
work. The total number of hours worked rose by 1.4% over the
same period.  In September, employment rose in Ontario and Manitoba and
fell in Saskatchewan. There was little change in the other
provinces.  There was more employment in a number of industries,
including retail and wholesale trade; construction; information,
culture and recreation as well as agriculture. Employment losses
were primarily in “other services”; business, building and other
support services; and natural resources.  The number of self-employed increased by 34,000 in
September, while there was little change in the number of
private and public sector employees. Despite the September
increase in self-employment, year-over-year gains in total
employment were primarily among private sector employees
(+159,000).  The number of workers aged 25 to 54 increased in September,
while there was little change in the other major demographic
groups.  Employment gains in Ontario and Manitoba  Following a decline in August, employment in Ontario grew
by 31,000 in September. Year-over-year growth was 0.7%, mostly
in part-time work, and below the national growth rate of 1.0%.
The unemployment rate for the province was 7.9% in September.  In Manitoba, employment increased for the second
consecutive month, up 6,600 in September, pushing the
unemployment rate down 0.4 percentage points to 5.0%. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment increased 1.6% (+10,000).  In September, employment in Saskatchewan declined by 3,600,
the first notable loss since November 2011. This decline brought
the unemployment rate up 0.3 percentage points to 4.7%. Despite
this loss, Saskatchewan continued to have one of the lowest
unemployment rates among the provinces.  Employment was little changed in  Quebec  for the month of
September. With more people searching for work, the unemployment
rate increased 0.4 percentage points to 8.0%. Year-over-year
employment growth was 0.8%, all in full time.  Industry perspective  Employment increased by 34,000 in retail and wholesale
trade in September. This increase offsets losses earlier in 2012,
leaving employment in the industry little changed from 12 months
earlier.  In September, the number of construction workers rose by
29,000, following losses the month before. This leaves
employment in the industry at a similar level to that of
September 2011.  In information, culture and recreation, employment rose by
24,000 in September. Despite this increase, employment in the
industry was virtually unchanged from 12 months earlier.  Employment in agriculture rose 8,700 in September, bringing
total year-over-year gains to 13,000 (+4.2%).  In September, the number of people working in “other
services” fell by 19,000. Employment in the industry was similar
to that of September 2011, as gains earlier in the period were
offset by losses in recent months.  Employment declined by 17,000 in business, building and
other support services. Nevertheless, year-over-year gains
totaled 26,000 (+3.9%).  Employment up for people aged 25 to 54  Employment rose among core-aged people (+36,000), mainly
men. Employment for men aged 25 to 54 rose by 21,000 in
September, the first notable increase since March 2011. With
this increase, the employment level for core-aged men is back to
its pre-recession peak of October 2008. However, the rate of
employment for this group was 85.2%, down from 86.5% in October
2008.  Employment among youths aged 15 to 24 was little changed in
September, and their unemployment rate stood at 15.0%. Compared
with 12 months earlier, youth employment fell by 70,000 (-2.8%)
and their unemployment rate increased by 1.0 percentage points.
Youths are the only demographic group that have not recovered
from the employment losses observed during the recession.  In September, employment among people aged 55 and over was
little changed. However, the year-over-year increase for this
group was 184,000 (+6.0%). The robust year-over-year employment
growth for both men and women aged 55 and over was, in part, the
result of population aging.  Quarterly update for the territories  The Labour Force Survey also collects labour market
information about the territories. This information is produced
monthly in the form of three-month moving averages. The
following data are not seasonally adjusted; therefore,
comparisons should only be made on a year-over-year basis.  In the third quarter of 2012, employment levels were little
changed in all three territories compared with the third quarter
of 2011. However, the unemployment rate in Nunavut declined by
2.4 percentage points to 14.8% over the period, as fewer people
were searching for work. The unemployment rate was little
changed for the other two territories and stood at 8.6% in
 Northwest Territories  and 5.3% in Yukon.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability.
Estimates for smaller geographic areas or industries will have
more variability. For an explanation of sampling variability of
estimates and how to use standard errors to assess this
variability, consult the “Data quality” section of the
publication Labour Force Information (71-001-X, free).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G,
free).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by removing the
effects of seasonal variations. For more information on seasonal
adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic
trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part -
partie3-eng.htm) .  Educational services  The LFS seasonal adjustment process removes typical
seasonal patterns in the monthly data, according to trends
established in previous years. While there have been larger
movements in educational services employment in summer months in
recent years, there has not been a consistent pattern in the
magnitude or direction of these changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
