The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped half a basis point to 129.5 as
of 8:08 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The
gauge is set to end the week down six basis points at its lowest
level since Sept. 19, after dropping for a seventh straight day,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined one basis point
to 154 as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC)  The measure is on course for its lowest close since Sept.
21, decreasing five basis points this week, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 223
basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in Tokyo, down one basis point
since Sept. 28, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
