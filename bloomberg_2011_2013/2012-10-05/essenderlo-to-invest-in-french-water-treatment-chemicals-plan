Tessenderlo Group, a Brussels-based
company, said today that it plans to invest about 75 million
euros ($98 million) in an electrolysis plant in  France  for the
production of water treatment chemicals and on soil cleanup.  The “turnaround project” will reposition the group’s
Loos, France, site to focus on water treatment, which
Tessenderlo said was one of its growth markets. Its water
treatment products are used as agents in wastewater and drinking
water treatment in such cities as Paris and Geneva.  To consolidate its position in the Western European market,
the company said it will invest 75 million euros on the Loos
site in the next decade. The investment will “allow the
conversion of the existing electrolysis facility to using modern
membrane technology, with capacity more than doubling, alongside
an environmental plan for the site soil remediation.”  The restructuring and investment over the next decade may
impact as many as 39 workers at Loos, where 158 are employed,
the company also said. Two production units for pharmaceutical
intermediates and sulfate fertilizers at Loos “do not offer any
perspectives of improving their respective situation, the
project is therefore to cease manufacturing,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
