Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , the Internet
recruiting service that is exploring a sale, fell the most in
two months after DealReporter said talks with a private equity
firm over a potential buyout had ended.  Shares fell 9.3 percent to $7.30 at 4 p.m. in  New York , the
biggest decline since Aug. 2. DealReporter said Monster
Worldwide and a U.S.-based private equity firm stopped talks
several days ago, citing unidentified people.  Monster, which first said in March it was considering a
sale, has been trimming its workforce and cutting costs after
European economic turmoil caused clients to pare use of its
products and companies such as  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD)  provide alternate
ways to find staff. Chief Executive Officer Sal Iannuzzi is
trying to reverse an 82 percent decline in the stock since he
took the helm April 11, 2007.  The shares are up 5.2 percent since Feb. 29, the day before
Iannuzzi said he would weigh selling the company. Monster said
on March 5 that it hired Stone Key Partners LLC and  Bank of
America  Corp.â€™s Merrill Lynch to help it review strategic
alternatives.  Andi Rose, a spokeswoman for New York-based Monster,
declined to comment on whether talks with private equity firms
have ended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
