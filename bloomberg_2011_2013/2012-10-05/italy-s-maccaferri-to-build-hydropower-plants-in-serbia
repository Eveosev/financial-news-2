Italy ’s Maccaferri Group will start
building 10 small hydropower plants in  Serbia  by mid-2013,
Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic’s office said today.  The plants along the Ibar River will cost 350 million euros
($455.35 million) to build, Dacic’s office said in an e-mailed
statement. It’s ‘the first part of a strategic project for the
construction of hydropower capacities in Serbia and the Bosnian
Serb republic worth 2 billion euros.’’  Maccaferri Group’s Seci Energia SpA and Serbia’s state-run
power monopoly  Elektroprivreda Srbije  first signed a deal in
February 2011 to develop plants along the border between Serbia
and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as part of Italy’s effort to meet a goal
of deriving 17 percent of power consumption from renewable
sources by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
