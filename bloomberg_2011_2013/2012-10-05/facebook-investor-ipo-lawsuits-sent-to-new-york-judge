Facebook Inc. (FB)  investor lawsuits over
the social media company’s initial public offering will be heard
by a New York federal judge, a seven-judge panel ruled.  The  U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation  ordered
yesterday that 41 lawsuits filed in  California ,  Florida  and New
York be consolidated before Robert Sweet in federal court in
 Manhattan .  The investors sued after a drop in Facebook’s  stock  after
it started trading in May. The investors claim Facebook failed
to disclose discussions it had with underwriters’ analysts about
its growth in advertising and the analysts revised their earning
forecasts and gave the information to “preferred investors,”
according to the panel’s ruling. Facebook closed yesterday in
New York at $21.95, below the IPO price of $38.  Eight of the lawsuits were filed against  Nasdaq , alleging
it caused technical and other trading-related errors that
created market uncertainty and caused investor losses.  Nasdaq opposed consolidation of the lawsuits involving
Facebook and itself.  “Though the Nasdaq actions involve different defendants
and claims from those in the securities and derivative actions,
they do include enough common questions of fact, related
circumstances and common discovery to warrant centralization,”
the panel said.  The case is In Re: Facebook Inc. IPO Securities and
Derivative Litigation, MDL 2389, U.S. Judicial Panel on
Multidistrict Litigation (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
