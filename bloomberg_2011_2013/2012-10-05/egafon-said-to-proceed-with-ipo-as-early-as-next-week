OAO MegaFon,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator, may start an initial public offering in
London as early as next week, people familiar with the plans
said.  The company, controlled by Russia’s richest man,  Alisher
Usmanov , and partially owned by Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , may
announce an intention to float shares in the middle of next week
after consultations between the shareholders and banks, said the
people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private.
The possible IPO size could be $3 billion, the people said.  “MegaFon could be more attractive than  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT)  and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , as it leads in the promising
mobile data segment and has the most clear geographic focus
among the Big 3 operators, with less than 1 percent of its
revenues generated outside of Russia,” Konstantin Chernyshev,
analyst of UralSib Financial Corp. said in a note last month.  Russian companies are returning to stock offerings after
the central bank sold a $5.2 billion stake in Sberbank last
month. MD Medical Group Investments Plc, Russia’s largest chain
of maternity centers, and the billionaire Ananiev brothers’ OAO
Promsvyazbank said this week that they are seeking to raise as
much as $343 million and $414 million respectively in London
share sales.  A  MegaFon  official declined to comment.  Talanx, Telefonica  MegaFon may offer investors as much as 20 percent of its
shares, including 10.6 percent from TeliaSonera’s stake and 9.4
percent held by a MegaFon unit, according to a shareholder
agreement reached in April when Russian billionaire Mikhail
Fridman’s Altimo cashed out of MegaFon.  Altimo then sold its 25 percent stake in MegaFon for almost
$4 billion in cash, valuing the company at $15.9 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg and based on
TeliaSonera’s statement. The company also paid $5.2 billion in
dividends in April as part of Fridman’s exit and Usmanov gaining
control of the operator.  MegaFon hired  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Russia’s Sberbank and
VTB Capital to manage the sale, people familiar with the matter
said in June.  Initial share sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
have raised $6 billion this year, compared with $37 billion in
the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Deutsche Bank AG, which along with Berenberg Bank led the
$602 million IPO of German insurer Talanx AG last month, is
ranked first in managing 2012 sales, according to the data.
Earlier this week,  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s biggest phone company,
said that it plans to sell shares in its German business this
quarter to help reduce a debt pile of more than 58 billion
euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
