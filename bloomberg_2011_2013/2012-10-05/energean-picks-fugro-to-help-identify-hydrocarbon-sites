Energean Oil and Gas SA ,  Greece ’s
only hydrocarbon producer, picked Fugro NV to improve the
quality of recently obtained seismic data, with the aim of
identifying new drilling targets in the north Aegean Sea.  Fugro will analyse the data, which Energean obtained from
Greece’s  Energy Ministry , for a maximum period of 13 weeks, the
Athens-based company said in a statement today.  The data will be used to identify promising geological
areas in the Prinos basin, Energean said.  Energean already produces 2,000 barrels of oil a day from
two fields in the Prinos basin. That will rise to an initial
3,000 barrels when the Epsilon field begins phased production in
2013. The company has operations in Greece and  Egypt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
