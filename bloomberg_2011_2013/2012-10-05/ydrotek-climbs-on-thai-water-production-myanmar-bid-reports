Hydrotek Pcl (HYDRO) , a Thai water management
company, rose the most in more than eight months in Bangkok
trading following a report that it will operate a tap-water
production facility in Chiang Mai province and was bidding for
projects in Myanmar.  The shares closed 9.6 percent higher at 8.55 baht, the
biggest gain since Jan. 17, after the Thai-language Post Today
report cited Chief Executive Officer Salib Soongshawang as
saying the company had won a 2 billion-baht ($65 million) water
contract. It also said the Bangkok-based company was bidding for
management projects valued at 500 million baht in Myanmar.  Today’s advance raised the stock’s gain this year to 74
percent. Hydrotek, whose shares trade on the Market for
Alternative Investment, last December sold 30 million shares at
3.39 baht each in an initial public offering to expand in water
treatment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
