European coal for 2013 rose to the
highest level in a week.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp added as much as 1 percent to $97.75 a metric ton,
the highest level since Sept. 28, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contract has gained 0.6 percent this
week, its first weekly advance in a month.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
