Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state  oil company , plans an exploration project in  Ethiopia ,
said the East African country’s ministry of mines.  Ethiopia has suspended preparations for the new exploration
licensing round until the end of the year following the death of
former Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, according to  Ketsela 
Tadessa , the head of the  Petroleum Licensing  department at the 
ministry. The country also plans to set up a national oil 
company to manage resources, said Minister Sinknesh Ejigu.  “We will be busy reorganizing the blocks and then setting
them for companies to come and participate,” she said in an
interview in London. Petrobras “also wants to be in the  East
Africa  oil and gas exploration.”  A Petrobras official declined to comment.  Explorers are expanding in East Africa, which, except for
 Uganda , doesn’t have proved oil reserves. Later this year,
 Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  plans to start drilling a well in the  South Omo
Block  together with  Marathon Oil Corp. , the latest entrant in 
a project in Ethiopia.  Petrobras  has also drilled for oil and gas off Tanzania in 
a  partnership  with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)  It will be the 
largest explorer by market value in Ethiopia, followed by 
Marathon and Tullow and smaller companies such as Calvalley 
Petroleum Inc.,  Southwest Energy  and  PetroTrans Co ., according 
to the ministry’s website. The nation holds about 5 trillion 
cubic feet of gas resources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
