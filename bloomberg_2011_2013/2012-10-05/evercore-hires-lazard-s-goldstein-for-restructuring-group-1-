(Corrects to add debt financings to third paragraph.)  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , the
investment-banking advisory firm founded by  Roger Altman , hired
 Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) ’s Stephen Goldstein for its restructuring and debt
group.  Goldstein, who spent a decade at rival investment bank
Lazard, will be a senior managing director, focusing on
corporate restructuring and financing, New York-based Evercore
said today in a statement.  The 42-year-old banker provided advice on restructurings
and debt-financing transactions for companies including grocery
chain Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., commercial real-estate
lender iStar Financial Inc. and  Charter Communications Inc. (CHTR) , a
cable-television operator, the statement shows. Advisory firms
are preparing for an increase in restructurings amid concern
slowing global growth and Europe’s debt crisis will diminish
investor appetite for risky securities and limit options for
companies seeking to refinance.  William Repko, co-founder of Evercore’s restructuring
group, moved to a senior advisory role at the end of 2011. The
group is headed by co-founder David Ying. Evercore’s
restructuring group in April hired Steve Wellington as a senior
managing director in London from Bank of America Corp., and last
year recruited Lloyd Sprung from Miller Buckfire & Co.  Before Lazard, Goldstein worked as an investment banker at
Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. and its predecessor firm,
Montgomery Securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
