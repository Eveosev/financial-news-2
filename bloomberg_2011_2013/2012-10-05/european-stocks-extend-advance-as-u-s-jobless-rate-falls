European (SXXP)  stocks extended gains, with
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index heading for its first weekly advance
in three, after a report showed U.S. payrolls rose by 114,000
and the jobless rate fell to 7.8 percent in September.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 1 percent to 273.98 at 1:31 p.m. in
 London . The index is heading for a 2.1 percent weekly gain and
has rallied 17 percent from this yearâ€™s low on June 4 as
European Central Bank policy makers agreed on an unlimited
asset-purchase program and the  Federal Reserve  announced a third
round of quantitative easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
