Alexander Pertsovsky, chairman of
Renaissance Group, will leave the Russian company shortly,
Vedomosti reported, citing several friends that weren’t
identified.  His responsibilities will be divided between Alexander Merzlenko, head of  investment banking  in Russia, and John Hyman,
deputy president of  Renaissance Capital , the newspaper said.
Pertsovksy, who has been at the bank since 2002, quit his post
as head of RenCap in June, Vedomosti reported then.  “Pertsovsky continues to advise Renaissance Group
companies on strategic matters and transactions in Russia and
other geographies,” Renaissance Group’s press service wrote in
response to an enquiry asking whether he was leaving.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
