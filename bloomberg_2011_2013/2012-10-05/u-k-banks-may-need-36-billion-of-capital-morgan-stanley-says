U.K. banks may be driven by
regulators to hold as much as 22 billion pounds ($36 billion) of
extra capital to guard against residential mortgage losses,
according to Morgan Stanley analysts.  The Financial Policy Committee will likely require that
banks increase the risk weightings they apply to residential
mortgages, with  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  the most affected, the
analysts including Chris Manners wrote in a report today.  “These potential measures cause uncertainty for all the
U.K. domestic banks and challenge dividend assumptions,”
Manners said. “If increased risk weights are implemented too
quickly, this could choke off lending to the economy.”  The FPC is concerned that banks are allowed to assign
different risk weights to mortgages based on their own internal
models. The FPC recommended in March that Parliament give it
powers of direction over capital buffers and requirements
relating to areas such as residential mortgages and leverage
ratios.  Banks may need to sell new shares to raise capital while
they increase lending and remove bad loans and unwanted assets
from their balance sheets,  Andrew Bailey , head of prudential
regulation at the U.K.’s Financial Services Authority, said in
an opinion piece published in the Sunday Times on Sept. 30. The
regulator has changed the guidance given to banks on capital
needs over the past two months, Bailey wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
