A 2008 Aston Martin V12 DBS used by
Daniel Craig in “ Quantum of Solace ” sold last night for
241,250 pounds ($389,280) at a James Bond memorabilia auction.  The car, estimated to sell for between 100,000 pounds and
150,000 pounds, was the most expensive of 11 lots being
auctioned live by Christie’s International,  London , in front of
an invitation-only VIP audience of 600 people. It was bought by
an unidentified bidder on the telephone.  This six-liter Aston “plays a dramatic role in the opening
sequence of the film, in which Bond skillfully navigates winding
roads,” Christie’s said in an e-mailed release.  All the 007-related material came direct from the archives
of EON Productions. Proceeds, including Christie’s fees, were
donated to a range of charities.  Barnardo’s  will benefit from
the sale of the Aston Martin.  The event marks “Global James Bond Day” and 50 years of
Bond movies. The latest film, “Skyfall,” arrives in November.  A pair of La Perla swimming trunks worn by Craig in
“Casino Royale” sold for a further 44,450 pounds ($71,725)
against a low estimate of 3,000 pounds. Bidders on this lot were
encouraged in the room by the actors Judi Dench, who plays M,
and Samantha Bond, who is known for her role as Miss Moneypenny.  The second-highest price of the evening was the 157,250
pounds given for an Omega Automatic Seamaster Professional
“Planet Ocean” watch worn by Craig in “Skyfall.” It had been
estimated at 6,000 pounds to 8,000 pounds.  Adele’s Autograph  Former 007 Roger Moore was on the rostrum to sell the
orchestral score for “Skyfall.” Signed by the singer Adele and
co-writer Paul Epworth, this sold for 13,750 pounds.  The live sale raised 752,050 pounds from just 11 lots. A
further 42 lots of Bond memorabilia are being offered by
Christie’s in an online sale that ends at 2 p.m. local time on
Oct. 8. As of yesterday, that event had already raised a further
360,000 pounds, said Christie’s.  These online lots include a belt with golden-bullet buckle
worn by Christopher Lee as Scaramanga in “The Man With the
Golden Gun”; a charcoal suit worn by Pierce Brosnan in “The
World Is Not Enough”; and a pair of Tom Ford sunglasses worn by
Craig in “Quantum of Solace.”  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
