The Swiss central bank’  foreign-
currency reserves  rose to a record last month as pressure on the
franc ceiling continued.  Holdings increased to 429.3 billion francs ($460.5 billion)
at the end of September from 420.8 billion francs in the
previous month, the Zurich-based  Swiss National Bank  said on its
website today. The holdings are calculated according to
International Monetary Fund standards at the beginning of every
month.  SNB President Thomas Jordan has pledged to enforce the
franc ceiling of 1.20 per euro introduced in September 2011
“with the utmost determination” as the euro area’s fiscal
crisis prompted policy makers to pile up record currency
holdings. The franc has weakened 0.9 percent versus the euro
since the  European Central Bank  said on Aug. 2 it will buy
 government bonds  in tandem with  Europe ’s rescue fund.  The franc traded at 1.21145 versus the euro at 9:28 a.m. in
Zurich. It has remained in a range of 1.20 to 1.24 since the cap
was imposed, breaching it just once. Against the dollar, the
Swiss currency was at 93.17 centimes.  Financial Crisis  The central bank started piling up foreign-currency
holdings in March 2009, when policy makers began their first
round of purchases to stem the franc’s ascent. Investors have
been seeking the Swiss currency as a haven from the global
financial crisis.  Through its purchases, the SNB has boosted liquidity
available to the country’s banks and consumers, raising the risk
of price increases in the medium and long term. Still, Swiss
consumer prices fell from a year ago for a 11th straight month
in August and Jordan said on Sept. 25 that “in the foreseeable
future, there is no risk of inflation.”  The government is scheduled to publish September consumer
prices on Oct. 8.  To contact the reporters on this story:
