Moore Capital Management LLC’s
European business made 31.7 million pounds ($51.3 million) last
year, a 45 percent increase from 2010 after it cut expenses.  Revenue for the hedge fund’s London-based unit declined to
76.7 million pounds from 117 million pounds in the year-earlier
period, according to a filing today with the U.K.’s Companies
House. Administrative expenses fell to 44.6 million pounds from
95.3 million pounds, the filing said.  Moore, the $15 billion New York-based firm founded by Louis Bacon, struggled last year as its two main hedge funds lost
money. Bacon, 56, told clients in August he planned to return $2
billion, or 25 percent of the money in the fund he manages, to
investors, saying it may be too big to generate good returns.  Moore Europe Capital LLP was eligible to distribute its
31.7 million pounds of profits to the unit’s seven members, the
filing showed. The members include Bacon and Greg Coffey, Moore
Europe’s co-chief investment officer, the filing said.  Tom Burns, a spokesman for Moore based in  London , declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
