Japan  is on target to cut greenhouse
gas emissions by an estimated average of 8 percent for the five
years ending in March, meaning it will meet commitments under
the Kyoto Protocol, the environment ministry estimated.  Kyoto’s binding obligations limiting the release of
emissions among industrial nations stipulate Japan must cut
greenhouse gas output by 6 percent from 1990 levels for fiscal
2008-2012. Emissions are projected to be 1.277 billion metric
tons for fiscal 2011 and 1.316 billion tons in the twelve months
ending March 31, 2013, Kentaro Doi, a ministry official in
charge of emissions data, said by phone today.  After taking into account the absorption of carbon dioxide
by forests and credits earned for offsets outside the country,
Japan’s emissions are projected to be an average of 8 percent
below 1990 levels, Doi said.  The internal estimates were produced by the ministry after
 the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan,  released an energy
demand outlook in July, he said. The ministry’s estimates were
earlier reported by the Yomiuri newspaper.  Greenhouse gas emissions are projected to increase this
fiscal year from the previous 12 months following the wider use
of fossil fuels after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the
official said, adding that an increase in economic activity also
boosted energy demand.  “We will keep implementing renewable energy and energy-
saving measures as we still have six more months to go” before
the fiscal year ends, Doi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
