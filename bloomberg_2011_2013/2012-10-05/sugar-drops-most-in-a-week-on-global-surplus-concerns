Raw-sugar futures fell the most in a
week as global production was forecast to exceed demand for the
third straight year. Cocoa gained, while orange juice dropped.  The  International Sugar Organization  has said that supplies
will outpace demand by 5.85 million metric tons in the 12 months
starting Oct. 1, following a 5.2 million surplus a year earlier.
Yesterday, prices reached an eight-week high, partly on demand
for refined sweetener.  “The surplus is rearing its head a little bit more
aggressively,” Jeff Dobrydney, a vice president at Wilton,
Connecticut-based Jenkins Sugar Group, said in a telephone
interview. “Any rally is going to be tempered by producer
selling.”  Raw sugar for March delivery slumped 1.6 percent to 21.25
cents a pound at 10:26 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A
close at that price would mark the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since Sept. 26. Yesterday, the commodity reached
21.77 cents, the highest since Aug. 8.  Cocoa futures for December delivery advanced 0.2 percent to
$2,399 a ton in  New York .  Orange-juice futures for November delivery gained 0.5
percent to $1.1495 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
