South Korea’s won climbed to an 11-
month high and government bonds fell after the European Central
Bank reiterated that it is prepared to start buying sovereign
debt in the euro region.  The central bank left its benchmark interest rate at a
record-low 0.75 percent yesterday and ECB President Mario Draghi
said bond buying can start once a member state requests such
action and agrees to conditions. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index rose 0.1
percent after Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s largest maker
of televisions and mobile phones, reported profit that beat
analyst estimates. Foreign funds raised holdings of South Korean
bonds by 1.5 trillion won ($1.3 billion) and equities by 3.1
trillion won last month, official data show.  “Draghi’s comments made it comfortable for dealers to hold
short positions on the dollar,” said Jude Noh, a Seoul-based
chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank. A short position is a bet
an asset will decline in value. “There is caution against
government’s intervention, but no big actions spotted.”  The won appreciated 0.2 percent today to 1,111.40 per
dollar and was little changed from a week ago in  Seoul ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,109.60 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 1. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, was little changed at 6.13 percent today.  South Korea’s foreign exchange  reserves  rose by the most in
11 months to $322 billion, a record-high, central bank data
showed today.  The yield on the 2.75 percent notes due September 2017
climbed two basis points to 2.82 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The rate touched 2.8 percent yesterday, the lowest
on record for a benchmark five-year note, and fell four basis
points this week. The one-year interest-rate swap added one
basis point to 2.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
