Treasury bond yields climbed to the
highest level in two weeks after a report showing the U.S.
 unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell added to concern the  Federal
Reserve ’s pledge to sustain stimulus will spur inflation.  The  difference in yields  between 30-year bonds and
inflation-protected securities increased to the most in almost
three weeks after the Labor Department said unemployment fell to
7.8 percent in September, the lowest since President  Barack
Obama  took office in January 2009. Fed policy makers said last
month when they announced a third round of bond buying that they
would continue to maintain stimulus measures even as the economy
strengthened.  “The market would view it as a positive, and an
inflationary story,” said Justin Hoogendoorn, a fixed-income
strategist at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  unit BMO Capital Markets in
 Chicago . “The unemployment rate dropping to 7.8 percent was a
big move. That’s a big headline print that can get things going,
get people thinking that things are getting better.”  The  yield  on 30-year bonds rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.97 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, the highest since Sept.
21. The 2.75 percent security due August 2042 declined 1 18/32,
or $15.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 95 20/32.  Benchmark  10-year note yields  rose seven basis points to
1.74 percent. The gap between the 10- and 30-year yields reached
1.24 percentage points, the most since Sept. 2011.  The so-called  break-even rate , which measures how much
traders anticipate consumer prices will rise over the life of
the debt, for 30-year securities touched 2.56 percentage points,
the highest since Sept. 18.  Lost ‘Luster’  The unemployment rate fell as employers took on more part-
time workers. The rate, which dropped from 8.1 percent, was
forecast to rise to 8.2 percent, according to the median
estimate of 88 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy
added 114,000 workers last month after a revised 142,000 gain in
August that was more than initially. The median estimate for job
gains was 115,000, according to another survey.  “People are looking at the rate more than anything else,”
said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading in New York at
 Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “They are saying it’s not as bad as they
originally thought. It’s taken some luster out of the
marketplace.”  The payrolls data comes a month before the  U.S.
presidential election . Employment and the economy are central
themes in the campaign, with Obama and Republican challenger
 Mitt Romney  each trying to convince voters they can best
energize the expansion and create jobs. The jobless rate had
stayed above  8 percent  since February 2009.  Fed Moves  While reducing borrowing costs, the Fed hasn’t made steady
progress toward meeting its mandate to achieve full employment.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  this week defended the central
bank’s bond-buying program, saying officials will sustain record
stimulus even after the domestic expansion gains strength. The
Fed said on Sept. 13 it will keep the main  interest rate  near
zero until at least mid-2015 and buy $40 billion of mortgage
debt every month in a third round of so-called quantitative
easing.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of Treasury and
mortgage-related debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
purchases, known as quantitative easing. It also began its
Operation Twist program to replace shorter-term debt in its
portfolio with longer-term securities and put downward pressure
on long-term borrowing costs.  ‘Fragile Recovery’  “We’re in a fragile recovery,” said John Fath, a
principal at the investment firm BTG Pactual in  New York  who
helps manage $2.5 billion. “The bottom line is the Fed is going
to be in here purchasing securities for a while.”  A private report Oct. 3 showed companies added more jobs
than forecast. Employers added 162,000 jobs last month, ADP
Employer Services data showed, compared with a forecast of
140,000 jobs in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  Applications for  jobless benefits  increased 4,000 to
367,000 in the week ended Sept. 29, Labor Department figures
showed yesterday. The median forecast of 51 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a rise in initial jobless claims
to 370,000.  Treasuries have gained  2.1 percent  this year, according to
Merrill Lynch indexes. Bonds returned 9.8 percent last year
after gaining 5.9 percent in 2010, according to the index.  Ten-year yields will rise to 1.75 percent by December,
according to the median forecast in Bloomberg surveys of banks
and securities firms.  ‘Higher Yields’  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Oct. 2, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by  161,790 contracts  on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions rose by 78,264 contracts, or
94 percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report.  The U.S. will sell $66 billion in notes and bonds next week
on three consecutive days beginning Oct. 9. It will auction $32
billion in three-year debt, $21 billion in 10-year securities
and $13 billion in 30-year bonds, the Treasury announced
yesterday.  “The market will turn its attention to next week’s
supply,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at the
primary dealer Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. “At these
levels, the market has to go to higher yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
