Sam Bradford threw two touchdown
passes to lead the St. Louis Rams to a 17-3 win that gave the
 Arizona  Cardinals their first loss of the National Football
League season.  Bradford, who completed 7 of 21 passes for 141 yards,
connected with Lance Kendricks on a 7-yard scoring pass in the
first quarter and Chris Givens on a 51-yard throw in the fourth
quarter last night at Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. He threw
one interception in the third quarter.  Greg Zuerlein added a 53-yard second-quarter field goal for
the Rams, who improved their record to 3-2.  Rams wide receiver Danny Amendola injured his right
shoulder in the second quarter and didn’t return to the game. He
missed most of last season when he dislocated his elbow in the
team’s season opener.  Jay Feely kicked a 35-yard field goal for the Cardinals,
who fell to 4-1.  Arizona’s Kevin Kolb threw for 289 yards on 28-of-50
passing. The Cardinals recorded 237 yards in the air compared
with 131 yards for the Rams, who outgained the visitors 111-45
on the ground. Kolb was sacked nine times.  The Atlanta Falcons and Houston Texans are the only
remaining undefeated NFL teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
