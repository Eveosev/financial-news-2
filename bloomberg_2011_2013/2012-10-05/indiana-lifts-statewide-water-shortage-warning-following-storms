Indiana  lifted a statewide water
shortage warning thatâ€™s been in effect since July after historic
drought conditions eased.  The warning was rescinded, with a call to continue
voluntary conservation including water recycling, use of drip
irrigation and pipe leak-reduction measures, after much of the
state received normal to above-normal rainfall last month and in
August, state authorities said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
