Original artwork for the “Sgt.
Pepper” album may sell for as much as 80,000 pounds ($129,000),
50 years after the Beatles released their first record.  Peter Blake ’s original collage for the insert in the 1967
album “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” is included in
 Sotheby’s (BID)  Nov. 13 auction of Modern British art, the auction
house said in an e-mailed release today.  Owned by the late architect Colin St. John Wilson, who
designed the British Library in  London ’s St. Pancras area, the
collage has a minimum valuation of 50,000 pounds.  Blake worked closely with  John Lennon  and  Paul McCartney  to
create the imagery of Sgt. Pepper. The British Pop artist
designed both the record sleeve and the insert, the latter
featuring cut-out sergeant’s stripes and a clip-on moustache.  The Beatles’ debut single, “Love Me Do,” was released on
Oct. 5, 1962. It reached number 17 in the U.K. charts. The
 Rolling Stones  and the Beach Boys are also marking their 50th
anniversary this year.  Hirst Rifle  Damien Hirst’s spin painting on an assault rifle fetched
the top price in an auction that raised $675,000 for a peace
charity.  Hirst’s “Spin AK-47 for Peace One Day” sold for 55,000
pounds ($89,000) last night in London. It had been estimated at
25,000 pounds to 35,000 pounds in a Phillips de Pury & Co.
auction of works donated by contemporary artists to benefit
Peace One Day’s  Global Truce 2013  campaign.  The project, titled “AKA Peace,” was conceived by
photographer  Bran Symondson , a former soldier who served in
 Afghanistan . It followed an exhibition at London’s Institute of
Contemporary Arts showing 24 works by artists such as  Antony Gormley , Marc Quinn and Sam Taylor-Wood inspired by the AK-47.
The ICA show was curated by Jake Chapman, who, together with his
brother Dinos, was among the contributing artists.  “I am not readily associated with a sense of philanthropic
optimism,” Chapman said in a statement before the sale. “But
after a meeting with (charity organizer) Jeremy Gilley, my
pessimism was suspended in favor of supporting this audacious
attempt to intervene against human injustice.”  Gormley’s “Silence”, featuring a section of steel with
one of the Russia-designed AK-47s, sold for 50,000 pounds.  The Chapman Brothers’ fiber-glass sculptures of assault
rifle-toting girls, “Yin” and “Yang,” went for 35,000 pounds
and 45,000 pounds.  All 24 of the lots sold, raising a formal total of 417,100
pounds for Global Truce 2013. Phillips didn’t charge fees.  Information:  http://www.peaceoneday.org .  Muse highlights include  Lewis Lapham  on history,  Zinta
Lundborg’s   New York  weekend and  Jeremy Gerard  on theater.  To contact the writer on the story:
