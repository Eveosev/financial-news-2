Treasuries advanced, led by 30-year
bonds, before a government report forecast to show the U.S.
 jobless rate  increased last month, boosting the case for more
monetary stimulus.  Benchmark  10-year notes  pared a weekly decline as
economists said German factory orders data today will add to
evidence the euro region is heading for a recession amid the
sovereign debt crisis, underpinning demand for safer assets.
Treasuries still headed for a weekly loss as  inflation
expectations  rose, reducing the purchasing power of the fixed
payments from debt.  “The Treasury market will remain well supported around
current levels,” said  Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “We’d need a tremendous
deviation from the consensus expectations to trigger a
meaningful response in the market.”  The  30-year yield  fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 2.88 percent at 10:18 a.m. London time after rising to
2.88 percent, the highest since Sept. 25. The 2.75 percent bond
due in August 2042 gained 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face amount,
to 97 14/32. The 10-year yield dropped one basis point to 1.66
percent, paring this week’s increase to three basis points.  U.S. unemployment rose to 8.2 percent in September from 8.1
percent in August, according to the  median  projection of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Payrolls climbed by 115,000,
less than the 139,000 average over the first eight months of the
year, the report is also forecast to show. The Labor Department
will issue the data at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .  Fed Purchases  The  Federal Reserve  unveiled a third round of so-called
quantitative easing last month with open-ended purchases of $40
billion a month in mortgage-backed securities. The central bank
bought Treasury and mortgage debt valued at $2.3 trillion in the
first two rounds.  U.S. policy makers are battling an  unemployment rate  that
has topped 8 percent since February 2009, the longest stretch in
monthly records dating back to 1948. The world’s biggest economy
has so far recovered about 4.1 million of the 8.8 million jobs
lost in the wake of the 18-month recession ended in June 2009.  Demand for Treasuries will be sustained and yields will
probably increase only “moderately” to 2 percent by year-end
and 2.20 percent in the middle of 2013, UniCredit’s Purps said.
That’s still more bearish than the median of 76 predictions from
economists and strategists compiled by Bloomberg, which see the
rate reaching 2 percent in June.  Factory Orders  German  factory orders  declined 0.5 percent in August from
the previous month, according to a separate Bloomberg survey.
 Industrial production  in the euro area fell 0.3 percent in
August from July, according to economist estimates compiled
before the figure is released next week.  “The euro-region’s economy is undoubtedly on a path to
further deterioration,” supporting Treasuries, said Shinji Kunibe, chief portfolio manager for fixed-income investment in
 Tokyo  at Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees the
equivalent of $65 billion.  The difference in  yield  between 10-year notes and similar-
maturity inflation-linked bonds, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices, widened 17 basis points this week to 2.59
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
