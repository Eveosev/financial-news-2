Canadian  building permits  set a
record high in August, an unexpected increase led by non-
residential projects.  The value of municipal permits rose 7.9 percent to C$7.35
billion ($7.49 billion), following a revised 2.8 percent decline
in July,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
forecast a 1.3 percent decline according to the median of 10
responses to a Bloomberg survey.  The  Bank of Canada  has kept its  overnight interest rate  at
1 percent since September 2010 to encourage borrowing and
spending and said business investment and consumption will help
lead growth over the next year.  Permits for  non-residential construction  jumped 25.2
percent to C$3.17 billion, with work on institutional buildings
including schools and hospitals gaining 158 percent to C$1.05
billion.  Industrial permits rose 26.2 percent to C$638 million, and
commercial projects such as offices fell 8.5 percent to C$1.48
billion.  Residential permits fell 2.3 percent to C$4.18 billion.  The value of permits was 22 percent higher in August than
the same month a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
