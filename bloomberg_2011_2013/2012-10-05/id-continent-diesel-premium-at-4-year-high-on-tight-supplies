Diesel fuel  in the Midwest surged to
its highest premium since 2008 after inventories slipped for a
third week and U.S. corn and soybean crops were harvested at the
fastest pace since at least 1981.  Stockpiles of the region’s distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, fell by 1.87 million barrels to
29 million last week, the  Department of Energy  reported. About
41 percent of the U.S. crop was harvested as of Sept. 30,
compared with 15 percent a year earlier, according to the
 Department of Agriculture .  U.S. farmers are gathering crops at the fastest pace in
three decades this season, boosting demand for diesel fuel used
to power combine harvesters.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Mid-
Continent rose 13 cents to 32 cents over heating oil futures on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:13 p.m. New York time, the
highest level since Sept. 29, 2008.  “That’s a temporary squeeze,” said Mark Anderle, a trader
at Truman Arnold Cos. in  Dallas . “It’s following a seasonal
pattern and harvest has been accelerated this year because of
the drought. By the end of October it will correct.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
