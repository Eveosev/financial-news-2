BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  rose to its
highest in almost 10 months after Deutsche Bank AG raised its
earnings estimate for Australia’s largest mill saying it will
benefit from a proposed anti-dumping duty on imported steel.  The  stock  climbed 4.4 percent to 48 Australian cents at the
close in Sydney, its highest since November 21. The benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.9 percent.  Australia may impose anti-dumping tariffs of as much as
15.45 percent on hot-rolled coil steel imported from Japan,
South Korea,  Malaysia  and  Taiwan  after a complaint from
BlueScope, the Australian Customs and Border Protection agency
said in a  notice  on its website, citing preliminary findings.  BlueScope’s full-year net income may be boosted by A$14
million ($14.4 million) to A$39 million as a result, Deutsche
Bank said in the note dated yesterday. The steel mill posted a
 net loss  of A$1.04 billion in the year ended June 30.  “BlueScope remains our key pick of the steel sector,”
Emily Behncke, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in the report.
The company, which sold half of its building products units to
 Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  in August to pay debt, will also gain from
“likely underestimated leverage to the Australian housing
recovery and potential earnings upside from the U.S. recovery.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
