Palm oil  advanced, paring a third
weekly loss, as a slump to the lowest price in almost three
years spurred demand from importers.  The contract for December delivery gained 2.7 percent to
close at 2,415 ringgit ($791) a metric ton on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange. Prices dropped 5.2 percent this week after
falling to the lowest close since November 2009 on Oct. 2.  Palm oil has dropped 20 percent since the end of August as
a global economic slowdown weakened demand for the oil used in
everything from candy to biofuel amid an increase in output in
Indonesia and Malaysia. Inventories in Malaysia probably
increased 15 percent to a record 2.43 million tons in September
from 2.12 million tons in August, the median of estimates from
five analysts and two plantation companies showed.  “The demand undertone is fairly good,” said Vijay Mehta,
a director at Commodity Links Pte. in  Singapore . “If the market
stabilizes, buyers are willing to jump in. There is good buying
interest from  India  and Bangladesh.”  Futures may rally to 3,250 ringgit by the end of the fourth
quarter,  Abah Ofon , an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote
in a report today. The recovery will be driven by a drop in
Malaysian production as the high output season ends, and as
Indonesian inventories dwindle because of stronger demand from
China and India, the biggest users, he said.  Tax Proposal  Malaysia will study a proposal to cut export taxes on crude
palm oil and will decide “soon”, the Plantations Industries
and Commodities Ministry said today. Plantations Minister
Bernard Dompok had on Oct. 3 proposed a cut in taxes to between
8 percent and 10 percent from the current 23 percent.  Malaysia’s  output  climbed 10 percent to 1.83 million tons
in September from 1.66 million tons, while  exports  rose 4.9
percent to 1.5 million tons from 1.43 million tons, the survey
showed. The data are released on Oct. 10.  Soybean oil  for December delivery was little changed at
51.51 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery were little changed at $15.5075 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
