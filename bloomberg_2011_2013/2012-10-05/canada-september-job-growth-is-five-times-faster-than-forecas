Canadian  employment  rose more than
five times faster last month than economists predicted,
bolstering the central bank’s view that it may raise  interest
rates  as the economy recovers.  Employment rose by 52,100 following an August gain of
34,300,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The  jobless rate 
rose to 7.4 percent from 7.3 percent as the  labor force  grew by
72,600. The job gain exceeded all 24 forecasts in a Bloomberg
economist survey with a median of 10,000. The  unemployment rate 
was forecast to be unchanged.  Bank of  Canada  Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem said
yesterday that some slack remains in the job market and
reiterated policy makers may raise their 1 percent benchmark
interest rate as the economy recovers. The Canadian dollar
appreciated 0.3 percent to 97.79 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 1:42
p.m. in Toronto on signs of a durable economic recovery.  “The story is still there, we are moving forward,” said
Emanuella Enenajor, an economist at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce in Toronto. “If we see a pickup there is a
justification for tightening policy.”  Other Group of Seven central bankers have added stimulus
this year to boost growth including asset purchases by the U.S.
Federal Reserve. There was some evidence the  U.S. economy  is
also improving today, with the American jobless rate
unexpectedly falling to 7.8 percent in September.  Debt Crisis  Canada’s recovery may still be slowed by problems such as
Europe’s debt crisis, said  Shaun Osborne , Toronto-based chief
currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank. (TD)   “It may be difficult for the Canadian economy to keep
producing these kinds of job numbers,” Osborne said. “It’s
going to be quite some time still before the Bank of Canada can
tighten interest rates.”  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting unemployment
will average 7.2 percent next year and 6.9 percent in 2014.
Enenajor at CIBC said the central bank may keep rates unchanged
through next year.  Still, trading in overnight index swaps showed investors
pricing in 10.9 basis points of tightening for the central
bank’s May 2013 decision today. At the start of the week trading
had erased most bets on a rate increase.  Today’s report showed that full-time employment rose by
44,100 in September. Part-time positions rose by 8,000,
Statistics Canada said. Private companies added 29,100 workers
and public-sector employment fell by 10,800.  Retailers Hiring  Retailers and wholesalers added 34,100 workers in
September. Construction employment gained by 28,800 following a
decline of 44,000 in August that was the largest since December
2008.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in a statement today he
is “encouraged” by the job report, which he said shows Canada
has “the best job creation record in the entire G-7.”  The companies adding to payrolls include Air Canada. Last
month the country’s largest airline said it will hire 200 flight
attendants and pilots in the next year for a new leisure carrier
and more than 900 additional employees at the main airline.  Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose
by 18,300 while the self-employed increased by 33,800 in
September.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 3.3
percent from a year earlier, lagging the prior reading of 3.7
percent. That measure, which the  Bank of Canada  says is a key
indicator of inflation, rose 3.9 percent in July, the fastest
since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
