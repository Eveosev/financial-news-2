Increasing fuel-economy standards may
lead to rising demolition of  oil tankers  as charterers favor
efficient ships and owners try to save money on fuel, according
to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  “Owners today are caught between environmental issues and
trying to make money in a prolonged market slump,” the London-
based shipbroker said in an e-mailed report today. “The screw
is tightening on the less efficient tankers which could result
in even more tonnage consigned to the scrapyards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
