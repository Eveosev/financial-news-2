Chinese  property stocks  traded in
 New York , the best-performing industry group last month, will
keep rising on prospects policy makers will take steps to boost
growth in the real-estate sector.  “We are seeing a softening of the approach of policy to
the developers,” Joel Wells, who helps manage $6 billion at
Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC in Purchase, New York, said
by phone on Aug. 30. “We are seeing strong earnings come out of
most of the developers and very positive outlook in general for
the remainder of the year.”  Real-estate brokerage  E-House China Holdings Ltd. (EJ)  jumped 32
percent in August in New York, the biggest monthly gain since
2011, while SouFun, China’s biggest real estate information
website, surged 20 percent following a record 40 percent gain in
July. Xinyuan Real Estate Co. climbed 13 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the
U.S. rallied 2.6 percent last month.  China  will seek “stable and healthy” development of the
property market, policy makers said after a meeting on July 30
led by President Xi Jinping. The decision signaled a change in
an three-year policy in which the government imposed curbs on
the sector. E-House reported last month that second-quarter net
income more than doubled, SouFun said profit increased 68
percent, while Xinyuan raised its 2013 sales projection.  China’s July new home prices jumped the most since January
2011 in the nation’s four major cities, with 69 of 70 cities
tracked by the government climbing from a year earlier, the
National Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 18. Prices in Guangzhou
and Shenzhen gained 17 percent while Beijing and Shanghai prices
both increased 14 percent.  E-House, Soufun  American depositary receipts of Shanghai-based E-House
rallied to $6.06 last month in New York, after reaching a 15-month high of $6.45 on Aug. 14. E-House’s  adjusted net income 
increased by 127 percent from a year earlier to $15.3 million in
the three months to June, compared with analysts’ mean
projection of $7.25 million.  Soufun, based in Beijing, jumped to $41.77 in New York last
week, the highest level since its U.S. listing in September
2010. The Beijing-based company raised its 2013 revenue forecast
to as much as $548 million, from a $538 million guidance on Aug.
8. SouFun’s estimate beat the average forecast of $541 million
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  China’s Plan  The Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index surged 9 percent
in August, the biggest monthly rally this year. The government
may release a “long-term mechanism” for a stable and healthy
 property market  development in about three months, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported Aug. 15, citing Zhu Zhongyi, the
deputy head of the China Real Estate Industry Association.  Xinyuan, a developer based in Beijing, rallied to $5.64 on
Aug. 30. The company lifted its 2013 sales projection by 6
percent to over $880 million on Aug. 8.  There’s room for real estate shares to extend gains “given
that we have great visibility on earnings for the remainder of
this year and even into next year,” said Wells at Alpine Woods.
“You are going to see continued strength from high-quality
developers” in case there are no unexpected policies or global
incidents.  Phoenix New Media Ltd. (FENG) , an Internet and TV media outlet,
soared 58 percent in August to $8.82, leading gains on the
China-US gauge for the month. Net income at the Beijing-based
company jumped 120 percent in the second quarter while sales
increased 29 percent, it said in an Aug. 12 statement.  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., advanced 2.5 percent last
month to $35.13, rising for a second month. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index slid 3.1 percent in August, the biggest slump
since May 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
