  Nelson Mandela , the former South
African president who led the struggle against apartheid, has
been discharged from the hospital.  “His team of doctors are convinced that he will receive
the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he
received in  Pretoria ,” the South African  presidency  said in an
e-mailed statement today. “His home has been reconfigured to
allow him to receive intensive care there. The health-care
personnel providing care at his home are the very same who
provided care to him in hospital.”  Mandela had been hospitalized since June 8 with a recurring
lung infection. Doctors downgraded his condition to critical on
June 23. Mandela, 95, who was jailed from 1964 to 1990, served a
five-year term as president after the  African National Congress 
swept to victory in  South Africa ’s first multi-race elections in
1994. He earned global praise for urging reconciliation, and won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.  “Madiba’s condition remains critical and is at times
unstable,” the presidency said, referring to him by his clan
name. “Despite the difficulties imposed by his various
illnesses, he, as always, displays immense grace and
fortitude.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
