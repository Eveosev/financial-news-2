The Los Angeles Dodgers acquired
third baseman  Michael Young  from the Philadelphia Phillies in
exchange for minor league left-handed pitcher Rob Rasmussen.  To make room on the 40-man Major League Baseball roster,
the Dodgers yesterday transferred right-handed pitcher  Josh Beckett  to the 60-day disabled list.  Young, 36, a seven-time All-Star, played with the Texas
Rangers from 2000-12, winning the 2005 American League batting
title. He twice led the American League in hits in 2005 and 2011
and his 2,359 career hits rank seventh among active players.  Young owns a .300 career average in 1,949 games, while
posting six 200-hit seasons in his career.  In 126 games this season, his first with Philadelphia,
Young led the Phillies in hits and batted .276 with eight home
runs, 24 doubles and 41 runs batted in. On June 19 against the
Washington Nationals, he eclipsed the 1,000-career RBI mark with
a two-run home run.  Young played in the  World Series  twice as a Ranger in 2010
and 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
