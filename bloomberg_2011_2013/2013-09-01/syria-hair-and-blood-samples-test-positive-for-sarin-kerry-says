Hair and blood samples from  Syria  tested positive for the nerve agent sarin, U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  said in television interviews as he sought to build the case for Congress to authorize a military strike.  “It has tested positive for signatures of sarin,” Kerry said today on CNN’s “ State of the Union ” program. “So each day that goes by, this case is even stronger.”  The disclosure of potential forensic evidence in the Aug. 21 attack, which Kerry said was obtained by the U.S. from first responders in east Damascus, came one day after President  Barack Obama  slowed the path toward a military strike by saying he will seek authorization from Congress.  Kerry, who conveyed a sense of urgency in laying out the case for a military strike two days ago in a public address at the State Department, dismissed suggestions that his effort was undermined by Obama’s surprise decision to go to Congress.  “I did not advocate that the response had to be swift,” he said in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation” program. “There was an appropriate, deliberate process.”  Appearing on all five Sunday network news programs, Kerry made the case for why Congress should approve intervention in a Syrian conflict that has lasted more than two years and resulted in more than 100,000 deaths.  Hitler Comparison  “Bashar al-Assad now joins the list of  Adolf Hitler  and  Saddam Hussein ” who have used chemical weapons in times of war, Kerry said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program. “This is of great consequence to  Israel , to Jordan, to  Turkey , to the region, and to all of us who care about enforcing the international norm with respect to chemical weapons.”  Kerry, who opposed the  Iraq war  while running unsuccessfully for president in 2004, has become Obama’s most visible advocate for punishing the Syrian regime for using chemical weapons. The secretary of state raised expectations for an imminent response when he said on Aug. 30 that the U.S. had amassed “clear” and “compelling” evidence that chemical weapons were used.  The U.S. says an Aug. 21 attack by the Syrian regime in a Damascus suburb with chemical weapons killed 1,429 people, including at least 426 children. The Syrian government has denied using chemical weapons, saying elements of the opposition were responsible.  Decision Made  Obama made the decision to seek congressional authorization late on Aug. 30 as he walked around the South Lawn of the White House and talked for 45 minutes with White House Chief of Staff  Denis McDonough , according to an administration official who asked not to be identified to discuss internal deliberations.  The president didn’t consult Kerry or other cabinet members such as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel before the decision was reached, the official said.  Kerry said today that approval from Congress would strengthen Obama’s hand in building a coalition to punish the Assad regime.  “Our democracy is stronger when we respect the right of Congress to also weigh in on this,” he said on CNN.  Kerry said a decision by Congress to oppose military action wouldn’t prevent the president from launching a strike.  “He has the right to do that no matter what Congress does,” Kerry said on CNN.  Even so, he said, “We don’t contemplate that the Congress is going to vote ‘no.’ This case grows powerful and more powerful by the day.”  Intelligence Report  A U.S. intelligence report released last week concluded with “high confidence” that the Assad government carried out the Aug. 21 attack. Syria has a stockpile of chemical agents -- including mustard, sarin and VX -- and “thousands” of munitions to deliver them, it said.  Lawmakers offered mixed predictions today on whether Congress will authorize military action.  “If the vote were today, I think it would be a ‘no’ vote,” said Representative  Peter King , a  New York  Republican who sits on the House intelligence and Homeland Security committees.  “The president has not made the case,” King said on “Fox News Sunday.” “When they see the president being so weak and vacillating, many members of Congress will vote no.”  Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the House intelligence committee, backed Obama’s decision to seek a vote in Congress.  Worldwide Importance  “At the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion,” he said on CNN. “This is a national security issue. This isn’t about, you know, Barack Obama versus the Congress. This isn’t about Republicans versus Democrats. This has a very important worldwide reach in this decision.”  More than 100 of the 435 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, including 18 of Obama’s fellow Democrats, signed a letter last week saying Syria doesn’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. and calling on him to seek congressional approval before any military action.  Republican Senators  John McCain  of Arizona and  Lindsey Graham  of South Carolina, who have long urged a more aggressive U.S. role in Syria, have said Obama wasn’t planning to do enough.  “We have to have a plan,” McCain said on CBS. “It has to be a strategy. It can’t just be, in my view, pinprick cruise missiles.”  Regime Change  He said the best way to eliminate the danger of Assad using chemical weapons “would be the threat of his removal from power.” Obama has said a military strike would be limited and wouldn’t include a goal of regime change.  Kerry said he spoke with McCain and Graham as recently as yesterday.  “I am convinced that we can find common ground here with them and others so that they’re convinced that the strategy that is in place will, in fact, help the opposition,” he said on ABC’s “This Week” program.  The U.S. has warships on standby in the region that could launch Tomahawk cruise missiles. A Navy amphibious ship, the USS San Antonio, arrived in the eastern Mediterranean yesterday, joining five destroyers. The San Antonio, which typically carries about 300 Marines, could be used to evacuate U.S. personnel from embassies in the  Middle East .  Senator  James Inhofe  of  Oklahoma , the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, chided Kerry today for saying a military strike would be limited.  “We all know that isn’t going to be the case,” Inhofe said on Fox. “It’s going to be something that could be long and last a long period of time.”  More Difficult  Richard Haass , president of the  Council on Foreign Relations , a New York-based policy group, said the decision to seek a vote in Congress threatens to weaken the U.S. position.  “It’s important to do the strike,” Haass said on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS” program. “We’ve made it more difficult for ourselves with the delay and now with the need for congressional authorization. We’ve raised all sorts of questions about our reliability. We’ve raised questions about our predictability.”  Vali Nasr, a Middle East scholar who is dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in  Washington , said Obama has been hamstrung in trying to deter Assad by U.S. reluctance to intervene in Syria’s civil war.  “The critical deterrence is American decisiveness and commitment to the region,” Nasr said on ABC. “And unless and until that’s there, I don’t think we are either impressing our allies or we’re really threatening Assad.”  To contact the reporter on this story: David Lerman in Washington at  dlerman1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott at  jwalcott9@bloomberg.net
