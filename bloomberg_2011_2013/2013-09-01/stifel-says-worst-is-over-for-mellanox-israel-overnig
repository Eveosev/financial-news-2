Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  will
rebound from the biggest monthly slump this year as its Tel Aviv
delisting helps lower costs while the global economic recovery
boosts demand, the most-accurate analyst says.  Shares of Mellanox, the Israeli maker of equipment that
speeds electronic data transfers, slid 0.9 percent last week in
New York, extending its monthly drop to 14 percent. The
Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the most-traded Israeli
shares sank 2.5 percent for the week, led by  Partner (PTNR) 
Communications Co.  ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. (CKSW) , whose
largest investor is  George Soros ’s fund, rose 1.3 percent.  Today’s delisting from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will
help Mellanox save “hundreds of thousands” of dollars in
operating expenses each year, Chief Executive Officer Eyal Waldman said in a May 31 interview. The Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company reported July 24 earnings and sales that beat
estimates amid growing demand. The U.S. economy expanded more
than estimated in the second quarter and the euro-area returned
to growth after an 18-month contraction.  “The worst is over,”  Kevin Cassidy , an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co., said by phone from Washington on Aug. 30. He
ranks first among 18 analysts tracked by Bloomberg covering
Mellanox as his recommendations delivered the best relative
returns in the past year. “The Tel Aviv exchange doesn’t have
much volume and delisting will help cut costs. Demand for data
centers is growing and government spending increases as the
economy improves.”  Operating Expenses  Mellanox will be “voluntarily” delisted from the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange Sept. 1, the company said in a May 30 statement.
Some 20 to 25 percent of Mellanox shares were held in Israel,
UBS AG said in a May 31 note. The company reported total
operating expenses of $224.6 million in 2012, according to its
annual statement released Jan. 23.  Adjusted  profit  fell 68 percent in the second quarter to
$13.8 million, exceeding the $8.46 million average estimate of
13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales sank 26 percent to
$98.2 million, compared with the $95.6 million average forecast
of analysts.  Mellanox has tumbled 34 percent this year on concern
revenue will decline amid uncertainties about global growth. It
 trades  at 21 times estimated profit, or 12 percent below its
three-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
stock will jump 43 percent over the next 12 months, according to
the average of 13 analysts’ estimates. The shares ended the week
at $39.42 in New York while the Tel Aviv stock dropped 0.8
percent to 140.90 shekels, or $38.45.  Chemical Weapons  Israeli stocks joined a slump in global shares as investors
weighed prospects for an American military response to a
chemical weapons attack in Syria. President  Barack Obama  will
decide on America’s response on the U.S.’s own timeline,
Secretary of State  John Kerry  said last week. U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  failed to gain parliamentary backing for
military action.  The Bloomberg Israel-US gauge fell to 95.05 last week,
extending a monthly drop to 2.1 percent, the biggest since
October 2012. The  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  gained 0.6 percent to 1,185.11 at
the close in Israel following a second week of losses.  Partner tumbled 11 percent, the biggest weekly drop since
July 2012, to $7.25. Israel’s second-largest mobile phone
provider reported an 83 percent plunge in second-quarter profit
on Aug. 28. The Tel Aviv shares today narrowed the discount,
dropping 1 percent to 26.61 shekels, or $7.35.  ClickSoftware Technologies, an Israeli  software developer ,
rose to $6.88 in the biggest weekly gain in a month. The rally
trimmed its August plunge to 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
