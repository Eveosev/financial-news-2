Tomas Berdych beat Julien Benneteau
in straight sets at the  U.S. Open , where both defending
champions are scheduled to play this afternoon.  Fifth-seeded Berdych beat No. 31 seed Benneteau 6-0, 6-3,
6-2 in one hour, 54 minutes in the first singles match to finish
today at the National Tennis Center in New York. A semifinalist
last year, the 27-year-old Czech hit 36 winners with 14 unforced
errors, half as many as his opponent.  Berdych will vie for a place in the quarterfinals with
Stanislas Wawrinka, the ninth seed from Switzerland, who beat
unseeded Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (9-7).  There’s a 40 percent chance of rain on a warm and cloudy
day in Flushing, Queens, according to the  National Weather
Service . The chances of precipitation climb to 60 percent this
evening.  Defending champions  Andy Murray  and  Serena Williams  are due
to play today. Murray, of the U.K., faces  Florian Mayer  of
Germany, and top-seeded Williams takes on fellow American Sloane Stephens. Stephens beat Williams in the quarterfinals of the
Australian Open in January, the latter’s only Grand Slam loss
from July 2012 through June.  Tim Smyczek faces Spain’s Marcel Granollers this afternoon
for a spot in the fourth round. If Smyczek loses, it would mark
the first time in the tournament’s 133-year history that no
American man has reached the fourth round.  Novak Djokovic of Serbia, the 2011 champion and top seed in
the men’s draw, will face Portugal’s Joao Sousa in the opening
match of the night session at Arthur Ashe Stadium. They will be
followed Li Na of China and  Serbia ’s Jelena Jankovic in the
tournament’s first matchup of top 10 seeds. Na, the 2011 French
Open winner, is seeded No. 5; Jankovic is No. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
