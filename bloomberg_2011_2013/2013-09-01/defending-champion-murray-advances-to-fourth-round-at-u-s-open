Top-seeded Novak Djokovic joined
defending champions  Serena Williams  and  Andy Murray  in advancing
at the  U.S. Open , where the host nation is without a man in the
last 16 for the first time in the tournament’s 133-year history.  Spain’s Marcel Granollers ousted the last American men’s
player from the tennis season’s final Grand Slam last night,
rallying to beat qualifier Tim Smyczek 6-4, 4-6, 0-6, 6-3, 7-5
at the National Tennis Center in  New York .  Smyczek, who’s ranked 109th in the world and had previously
never advanced beyond the second round in a major championship,
was cheered on at the Grandstand Court before having his serve
broken at 5-5 in the fifth set. Granollers then held to win the
match and advance to a fourth-round matchup with Djokovic.  “I’ve never heard somebody yell out from the stands,
‘You’re our last hope!’” Smyczek, the last of the 15 Americans
in the 128-player men’s draw, said during his post-match news
conference. “That was new.”  Only two American men were seeded at the U.S. Open, with
No. 13 John Isner losing in the third round and No. 26 Sam Querrey eliminated in the second round.  Andy Roddick  was the
last American man to win the U.S. Open in 2003, while  Pete Sampras  and  Andre Agassi  combined to win six titles in the 10
years before that.  “At the very top of the game American tennis is a little
bit behind where it has been in years past,” Smyczek said. “We
got really spoiled with Pete, Andre and Andy for so many
years.”  Makarova’s Upset  While Djokovic, Murray and Williams all advanced in
straight sets, No. 24 Ekaterina Makarova of Russia scored
yesterday’s biggest upset with a 6-4, 6-4 win against third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland. Makarova advances to face
fifth-seeded Li Na of China, who routed Jelena Jankovic, the No.
9 from Serbia, 6-3, 6-0 in the first meeting of top 10 seeds at
this year’s tournament.  Serbia ’s Djokovic rolled to a 6-0, 6-2, 6-2 victory against
Joao Sousa of Portugal and has yet to drop a set through his
first three matches. Djokovic, who has reached the semifinals of
his past 13 Grand Slams, won in 101 minutes.  “I just wanted to do my job, win in straight sets, and
spend as less time on court as possible,” Djokovic said.  Williams, 31, cruised into the women’s quarterfinals with a
6-4, 6-1 win against fellow American Sloane Stephens in Arthur
Ashe Stadium. Stephens beat Williams in the quarterfinals of
January’s Australian Open, the latter’s only Grand Slam loss
from July 2012 through June.  Big Match  Stephens, 20, and Williams got into a media spat earlier
this year after the Australian Open, with Stephens accusing
Williams of being disrespectful. Williams, a 16-time Grand Slam
champion who is 64-4 this year, said after yesterday’s match
that it felt bigger than a fourth round meeting.  “The quality of the tennis was great,” said Williams, who
made 13 unforced errors to 29 for her opponent. “Sloane’s a
great player. It definitely had feelings more of a quarterfinal
or a semifinal match.”  Williams, who has faced a total of three break points in
her first four matches, next plays No. 18 seed Carla Suarez Navarro. The Spaniard rallied from a one-set deficit to oust No.
8 seed Angelique Kerber of Germany 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3).  Murray, who won his first major championship at last year’s
U.S. Open, overcame a sluggish start to beat  Florian Mayer  of
Germany 7-6 (7-2), 6-2, 6-2. The final two sets took a total of
65 minutes as Murray advanced to the round of 16 at a Grand Slam
for the 11th straight time.  Tough Start  “It was tough conditions, very, very humid,” Murray, 26,
said at a news conference. “But I started the second set well.
Started hitting the ball a little bit cleaner, was more
aggressive after that, and finished it well.”  Murray next faces  Uzbekistan ’s  Denis Istomin , who is
coached by his mother and advanced with a five-set win over
20th-seeded Andreas Seppi of Italy.  Fifth-seeded Tomas Berdych, a semifinalist last year, beat
Julien Benneteau in straight sets to advance to a fourth-round
meetings with No. 9 seed Stanislas Wawrinka, who beat Marcos Baghdatis 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (9-7).  Elsewhere in the men’s draw, unseeded 2001 champion  Lleyton Hewitt  of Australia defeated Evgeny Donskoy of Russia 6-3, 7-6
(7-5), 3-6, 6-1. Hewitt, 32, advances to face 31-year-old
 Mikhail Youzhny , the 21st seed from Russia who beat  Tommy Haas 
of Germany in four sets.  Over 30s  With  Roger Federer  (32),  David Ferrer  (31) and Tommy Robredo (31) also still playing, this is the first time since
1982 that there are four players over the age of 30 left in the
final 16 of the men’s draw.  Federer, a five-time U.S. Open champion and No. 7 seed,
faces the 19th-seeded Robredo today in Arthur Ashe Stadium.  Rafael Nadal , the No. 2 seed from Spain, is also in action
today against No. 22 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany, while No.
4 Ferrer of Spain faces No. 18 Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia, and
No. 8  Richard Gasquet  of France takes on 10th-seeded Milos Raonic of Canada.  Women’s No. 2 seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus plays No.
13 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in today’s top women’s match.  To contact the reporters on this story:
