Manchester United striker Wayne
Rooney sustained a cut forehead in training and has “no
chance” of playing for  England  in World Cup qualifiers against
Moldova and Ukraine, his club manager David Moyes said.  Moyes was talking to Sky Sports in a televised interview
ahead of today’s Premier League soccer game at Liverpool, which
Rooney will also miss.  “He got a cut down the middle of his forehead, completely
accidental, but it was quite a bad cut,” Moyes said. “It will
probably keep him out for a few weeks.”  England hosts Moldova on Sept. 6 and plays away to Ukraine
four days later.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
