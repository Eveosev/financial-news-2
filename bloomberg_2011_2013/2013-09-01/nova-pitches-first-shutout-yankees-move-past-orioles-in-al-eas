Ivan Nova pitched his first career
complete-game shutout and  Robinson Cano  drove in two runs for
the  New York Yankees  who moved past the Baltimore Orioles in the
American League East with a 2-0 win.  The Yankees (72-63) are in third place in the AL East,
eight games behind the division-leading Boston Red Sox (81-56)
and one-half game ahead of the Orioles (71-63).  Nova (8-4) yesterday allowed three hits and struck out five
in nine innings for his second career complete game.  Cano had a first-inning run-scoring double and a solo home
run in the eighth at Yankee Stadium. The home run, the 25th of
the season, was the 202nd of his career to tie Bill Dickey for
15th place on the team’s all-time home runs list.  Orioles pitcher Scott Feldman (4-4) gave up one run on six
hits and struck out five in seven innings.  Third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  didn’t play because of flu-like symptoms, the team said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
