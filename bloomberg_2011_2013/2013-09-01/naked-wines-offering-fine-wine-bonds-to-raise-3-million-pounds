Naked Wines UK, which has invested
more than 25 million pounds ($39 million) in independent
winemakers since 2008, is planning to raise 3 million pounds by
issuing what it calls the Naked Fine Wine Bond.  Investors can buy 500 to 10,000 pounds of the three-year
securities, which will pay 7 percent annual gross interest in
cash or 10 percent yearly wine credits, the Norwich, England-based company said in a  statement  on its website today. A 10
percent premium will be paid if investors choose to spend the
original amount they invested on wine when the bond matures.  Naked Wines has invested in 43 independent winemakers since
it was founded by 12 friends in 2008, according to the
statement. It has more than 120,000 customers who pay 20 pounds
per month to access wines at wholesale prices, including fine
wines which take more than a year from the grape to the bottle.  “Ultimately fine wines require more time to mature,
meaning we also need a longer-term source of funding in order to
give the winemakers the financial assistance they need,” Chief
Executive Officer and co-founder Rowan Gormley said in the
statement. Gormley was formerly CEO of Virgin Money and Virgin
Wines.  Naked Wines reported operating profit of 1 million pounds
and a 57 percent increase in sales to 34.9 million pounds in
2012, according to the statement. The bond has a minimum
subscription of 1 million pounds with a maximum of 5 million
pounds, and will remain open for as long as four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
