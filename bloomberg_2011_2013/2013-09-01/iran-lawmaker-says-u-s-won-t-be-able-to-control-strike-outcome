The U.S. will lose control of the
situation if it takes an “emotional” decision to attack  Syria ,
Alaeddin Boroujerdi, head of the Iranian parliament’s national
security and foreign policy committee, said today.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said yesterday he will seek
congressional authorization for any military strikes on Syria in
response to what the U.S. says was a chemical weapon attack.  Boroujerdi, speaking at a news conference in Damascus hours
after meeting President Bashar al-Assad, didn’t directly answer
several questions on what  Iran  would do if Syria were attacked.
He said any judgment on who was behind the attack in Ghouta
outside Damascus last month should wait for the results of the
samples taken by United Nations inspectors.  Shiite Muslim-ruled Iran supports Assad’s government and
has influence over the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah militant group
that’s fighting alongside Syrian government troops.  To contact the reporters on this story:
