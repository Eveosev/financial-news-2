Etihad Airways , the Abu-Dhabi based
carrier purchasing a 24 percent stake in  Jet Airways (India)
Ltd. (JETIN)  , said it expects the $600 million investment to be
approved by Indian authorities “imminently.”  The deadline for the regulatory approval of the deal was
extended to the end of September from Aug. 31, an Etihad
spokesperson said by telephone yesterday.  “The revised agreements are expected to be endorsed by the
 Competition Commission  of India and the Indian Government
imminently,” the carrier said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. This is the second deadline extension for the deal
approval.  The transaction marks the first stake sale by an Indian
carrier to a foreign airline after the nation eased ownership
rules last year. The airlines won conditional approval from
India’s Foreign Investment Promotion Board in July, pending
further approvals from the country’s finance minister and
Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.  “We are working very closely with the Indian Government
and regulatory authorities to ensure we meet all the
requirements of the new foreign direct investment legislation,”
Etihad Chief Executive  James Hogan  said in the statement.  Hogan and Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal met in Mumbai
this past weekend to “review progress on the finalization” of
the deal, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
