A case of Chateau Petrus 1971
Pomerol and two of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild ’82 are among top
Bordeaux on sale at Bonhams in  London  in September, along with
Romanee-Conti Burgundy and wines from Italian grower Sassicaia.  The Petrus ’71 carries a top estimate of 13,000 pounds
($20,130) and the cases of Lafite ’82 are priced to fetch as
much as 28,000 pounds each, according to the auction house’s
online catalog.  The sale on Sept. 12 comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index
of top Bordeaux has risen 4 percent this year, with a drop since
mid-March erasing half of its gain of 8 percent in the first 10
weeks of the year. As the benchmark heads for its second
straight quarter of declines, investor appetite at auctions has
been driven more by older Burgundy vintages and wines from other
regions such as Champagne, the Rhone Valley and  Italy .  Italian wines such as Sassicaia, a pioneering Tuscan
producer of Bordeaux-style wines, have “very high market
demand,” Sergio Esposito, director of Vino Management’s Bottled
Asset Fund, said by phone from Italy. “They are still very
affordable compared with anything else in the world that is the
top of the top.”  His fund is based in Grand Cayman, with about $9 million
currently under management and a further fundraising imminent.  Tuscan Coast  The Bonhams sale includes wines spanning 20 years from
Sassicaia, a vineyard on the Tuscan coast in Bolgheri which has
pioneered Bordeaux-style wines since the late 1960s. A mixed
half-case of its wines from 1982, 1985, 1988 and 1990 carries a
top estimate of 3,000 pounds, while a single six-liter imperial
from the 2002 vintage is priced to fetch as much as 600 pounds.  Leading Burgundies in the sale include a Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti 1978 Assortment case with a top estimate of 25,000
pounds, and another from 1976 priced to fetch as much as 10,000
pounds.  The Romanee-Conti vineyard in Vosne-Romanee is slightly
smaller than 2 hectares (5 acres) and has its own appellation as
a Burgundy grand cru wine. The rarity of its wines, along with
neighboring plots including La Tache, Richebourg and Echezeaux,
regularly makes them the highest-priced lots at auctions.  Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes dessert wine from the Bordeaux
estate’s 1942, 1967 and 1970 vintages is also up for sale, with
a lot comprising six bottles of the 1942 estimated to reach as
much as 3,000 pounds.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
