Job vacancies at  London ’s financial-services companies jumped 16 percent last month, as confidence
returned to the market, recruitment firm  Astbury Marsden  said.  Openings in the British capital’s City and Canary Wharf
financial districts rose to 2,490 in August from 2,150 in July,
the London-based recruiter said in a statement today.  Rising stock markets and a rebounding economy are prompting
employers to shift from hiring in areas such as compliance to
add revenue-generating staff in investment banking and trading,
the company said. The U.K. economy grew by 0.7 percent in the
second quarter, more than initially estimated, helped by
construction and manufacturing. The FTSE 100 Index of Britain’s
biggest companies has gained 8.7 percent this year.  “Many employers have been holding back from hiring for
revenue-generating front office positions,” Chief Operating
Officer  Mark Cameron  said in the statement. Now they are
“starting to feel that the time is right to start filling these
roles in order to help drive business growth.”  Candidate numbers last month were slightly above the
average for the year to date, with an estimated 4,680 people
looking for a new job, the recruiter said.  Astbury Marsden estimated the figures based on advertised
vacancies, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
