Gold output in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest producer, advanced in the second quarter
on an increase in the amount of metal mined and higher ore
grades, according to mining consultant Surbiton Associates Pty.  Production was 67 metric tons in the three months through
June, about 3.5 tons more than the previous quarter and 3 tons
higher than the same period a year earlier, Melbourne-based
Surbiton said in a statement. Output was 259 tons in the year
ended June 30, “marginally less” than the year prior, it said.  Gold slumped in the second quarter as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value and an improving U.S.
economy boosted speculation the  Federal Reserve  may scale back
debt purchases that helped bullion cap a 12-year bull run in
2012. Prices rebounded from a 34-month low in June on increased
demand for jewelry, bars and coins in  Asia .  “The increase in grade was precisely what we expected
would happen following the price fall in early April,” Sandra Close, a director at Surbiton, said in the statement. “One of
the easiest ways to cut cash costs per ounce is to increase the
grade of ore going into the treatment plant.”  China was the world’s biggest gold  producer  in 2012 followed
by Australia, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
