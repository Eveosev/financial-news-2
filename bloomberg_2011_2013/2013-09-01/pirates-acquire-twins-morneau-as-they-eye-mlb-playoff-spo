Four-time All-Star first baseman
Justin Morneau was acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the
 Minnesota Twins  to beef up their offense as the team seeks a
spot for the first time in 21 years in the Major League Baseball
playoffs.  “We felt that this move gives us a better chance to play
in October, a better chance to win the division, a better chance
to advance in October,” Pirates General Manager Neal Huntington
said yesterday.  The Twins obtained outfielder Alex Presley and either a
player to be selected later or cash.  Morneau, 32, who spent 11 seasons with the Twins, hit .259
with 17 homers and drove in 74 runs this season for  Minnesota .
He was the  American League ’s Most Valuable Player in 2006 when
he hit .321 with 34 homers and 130 RBIs.  The Pirates will pick up the remaining portion of Morneau’s
$14 million salary, estimated at around $2 million, the
 Associated Press  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  In the past week, the Pirates also acquired outfielder
Marlon Byrd and catcher John Buck from the  New York  Mets.  “We’ve got more depth, we’ve got more options than we had
four days ago,” Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. “We’re a
better team. We’re a stronger team.”  The Pirates (79-56) defeated St. Louis 7-1 last night to
take sole possession of first place in the National League
Central division, one game ahead of the Cardinals (78-57).  To contact the reporter on this story:
