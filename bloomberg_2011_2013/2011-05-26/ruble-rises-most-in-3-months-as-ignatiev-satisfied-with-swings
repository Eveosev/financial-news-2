The ruble surged the most in almost
three months against the dollar as companies bought the currency
to pay taxes and Sergey Ignatiev, chairman of Bank Rossii, said
he was “satisfied” with the ruble’s volatility.  The Russian currency appreciated 1 percent to 28.1799 per
dollar by the 5 p.m. close of trading today, the biggest one-day
advance since March 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The ruble snapped a four-day drop against the euro, adding 0.2
percent to 39.9650.  Russian exporters have to pay about 190 billion rubles
($6.7 billion) of taxes this week, according to HSBC Holdings
Plc estimates. Ignatiev told a conference in  St. Petersburg 
today he is “entirely satisfied” with swings in the ruble and
isn’t yet considering expanding its trading corridor. One-month
dollar-ruble volatility hit a seven-month high on May 23, as the
price of oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, swung between gains
and losses.  Moves against the dollar and the euro left the ruble 0.6
percent stronger at 33.4832 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket, the strongest level this week. Bank Rossii
use the basket to manage swings in the ruble that hurt Russian
exporters. The rate is calculated by multiplying the dollar-
ruble rate by 0.55, the euro-ruble rate by 0.45, then adding
them together.  Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend, was little changed
at $113.06 a barrel today, after gaining 2.5 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
