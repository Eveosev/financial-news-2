Ukraine exported 600,000 metric tons
of grain this month, said Volodymyr Klymenko, the head of the
country’s Grain Association.  Outbound shipments in June will probably be around 1
million tons, Klymenko said at a conference of the Grain and
Feed Trade Association in the capital, Kiev, today.  Ukraine’s grain stockpiles by July 1 are poised to be 8.7
million tons, exceeding a government forecast by 2.7 million
tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
