Taiwan ’s dollar rebounded from near a
one-month low on optimism the island’s economic growth prospects
will spur overseas investors to add to holdings of local assets.  The local dollar gained 4.9 percent this year, the best
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies, as exchange
data show global funds bought $1.6 billion more Taiwanese shares
than they sold. The jobless rate dropped to 4.35 percent in
April, the lowest since September 2008, data showed this week.
The Taiwan dollar fell 0.8 percent in the first three days of
the week.  “Looks like today’s move is a technical rebound from the
recent decline,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at
First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “Basically the long-term trend
for Asian currencies to rise hasn’t changed.”  The  Taiwan dollar  strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$28.945
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.010
earlier, near the one-month low of NT$29.020 reached on May 24.  Government bonds  dropped. The yield on the 1.375 percent
security due March 2021, the most-traded government debt, gained
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.444 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
