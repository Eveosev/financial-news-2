Cotton prices fell the most in two
weeks after importers canceled more sales from the U.S., the
world’s leading exporter.  Orange juice  dropped.  A net total of about 32,960 bales of cotton sales for
delivery before July 31 were scrapped in the week ended May 19,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said. That’s the ninth
straight week that deals were canceled on a net basis. Prices
have tumbled 31 percent from a record reached in March as demand
eased in  China , the biggest consumer.  “This certainly confirms that there is no demand right
now,” said Chris Kramedjian, a risk-management consultant at
FCStone Fibers & Textiles in Nashville, Tennessee. “The themes
of the last eight weeks are carrying on.”  Cotton for July delivery dropped 5 cents, or 3.2 percent,
to settle at $1.5103 a pound at 3:02 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York . The commodity touched an all-time high of $2.197 on
March 7.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery slid 1.45 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $1.8535 a pound in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
