The  Botswana Confederation of
Commerce, Industry and Manpower , which represents businesses in
the southern African nation, is mediating in a six-week dispute
between the government and state workers,  Mmegi  said, citing
confederation President Modiri Mbaakanyi.  The organization has met with Finance Ministry officials
and plans to meet labor leaders this week, the Gaborone-based
newspaper said on its website. Mbaakanyi will discuss government
plans to narrow the  budget deficit  with labor unions in the
first round of mediation, Mmegi reported.  State workers, including teachers and nurses, have been on
strike since April 18. Unions want a 12 percent pay increase,
while the government is offering 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
