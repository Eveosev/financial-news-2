A blast two days ago that killed as
many as four people at the Abadan refinery in southern  Iran  was
a result of sanctions against the country and government
pressure to promote the project,  Arman  reported.  The blast, followed by a fire, hit one of the two main
compressors of the refinery, the Tehran-based newspaper said.
The system, used to liquefy gas, wasn’t ready to be operated,
the paper said, cited unidentified officials.  Officials in the Iranian president’s office for media
affairs and the public relations department of the  National
Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Co . couldn’t immediately
be reached by phone. Thursday is the start of Iran’s weekend.  The compressors for this unit at the refinery were
purchased from Munich-based Siemens AG, the paper said.
The company declined to send experts to Iran to operate the
machine for the launch, citing restrictions due to international
sanctions against the country, an  National Iranian Oil Refining
and Distribution  official said, according to the paper.  Officials at Siemens couldn’t immediately be reached by
telephone at the company’s headquarters in Munich.  Iranian personnel were in charge of operating the
compressors and were under pressure to proceed with the project
despite concerns about an accident, the paper said.  The explosion took place during the inauguration ceremony
of the new wing at the refinery, an event intended to underscore
Iran’s self-sufficiency in producing gasoline. President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  attended the inauguration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
