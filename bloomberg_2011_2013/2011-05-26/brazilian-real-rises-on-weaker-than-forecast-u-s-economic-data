Brazil’s real gained the most in a
week after the U.S. reported  consumer spending  and economic
growth that was less than forecast, signaling policy makers in
the world’s biggest economy will keep borrowing costs at record
lows, increasing demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real advanced 0.9 percent to 1.6151 per dollar, the
strongest in a week, as of 5:45 p.m. in  New York , from 1.6292
yesterday.  U.S. consumer spending cooled in the first quarter more
than previously estimated and economic growth was slower than
analysts forecast. Brazil’s unemployment rate fell in April to
the lowest for the month since at least 2002, keeping pressure
on policy makers to raise interest rates to control inflation.  “The weak U.S. data are fueling bets that the Fed will
keep  interest rates  low, signaling the dollar will continue
weakening,” said Mauricio Junqueira, who helps manage $300
million at Squanto Investimentos in  Sao Paulo .  The dollar index, which tracks the currency’s value against
those of six major trading partners, dropped 0.5 percent to
75.57. It earlier fell as much as 0.8 percent, the most in a
month.  Household purchases in the U.S. rose at a 2.2 percent
annual pace from January through March, less than the 2.7
percent calculated last month and short of the 2.8 percent
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, according
to Commerce Department figures today. The  U.S. economy  expanded
at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the quarter, compared with the
2.2 percent median forecast in the survey.  Brazil  Unemployment  Unemployment in Brazil fell to 6.4 percent last month from
6.5 percent in March, the national statistics agency said today
in  Rio de Janeiro .  Brazilian central bankers have raised the country’s
benchmark rate 325 basis points, or 3.25 percentage points, to
12 percent since April 2010 to rein in the fastest inflation in
six years. The U.S.’s key rate is between zero and 0.25 percent.  Yields on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2013 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 12.56
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
