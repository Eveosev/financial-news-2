Indonesia ’s National Energy Council
advised limiting the country’s coal and natural-gas exports so
domestic energy consumers can substitute cheaper resources for
oil, SteelGuru said, citing a Jakarta Post report.  Industries and the state electricity company are facing
difficulties in holding down primary energy costs because of the
limited amounts of coal and gas available on the local market,
council member Herman Darnel Ibrahim was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
