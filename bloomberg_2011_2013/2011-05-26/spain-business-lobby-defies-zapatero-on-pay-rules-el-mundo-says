Directors of  Spain ’s CEOE business
lobby urged its head, Juan Rossell, to continue negotiating
wage-bargaining rules with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, to complete reforms that have already
dragged on beyond a March deadline,  El Mundo  reported.  Zapatero said yesterday that progress has been made in
talks between unions and employers on wages and that he hoped
the negotiations would be completed soon.  Juan Pablo Lazaro, who heads CEIM, a lobby group
representing Madrid-based businesses, and Angel Asensio, the
head of a group representing textile companies, are urging the
CEOE to reject Zapatero’s proposals, El Mundo said, citing a
written proposal by the lobbyists.  Spain is overhauling labor and pension rules and
implementing the deepest budget cuts in three decades, in an
attempt to shield its economy from the sovereign-debt crisis. In
January, Zapatero set a March 18 deadline for unions and
employers to reach a deal on changes to wage-bargaining rules as
the government aims to make it easier for Spanish companies to
compete abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
