German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  urged
fellow Group of Eight leaders to step up their commitment to
cutting debt, underscoring differences between the U.S. and
Europe on the pace of deficit reduction.  “Consolidation stategies” will be a topic at the G-8
summit starting today in Deauville, France, Merkel said in a
speech to lawmakers in Berlin before leaving for the talks at
the Channel coastal resort. Germany’s strategy of embedding debt
and deficit cuts in the constitution is “the right path,” she
said.  Debt reduction is needed “not just for us now but for
coming generations and we must always have that in mind,”
Merkel said. “That must be the spirit of talks in Deauville.”  Merkel’s refrain contrasts with the Obama administration’s
battle to raise the $14.29 trillion national debt limit to avert
a default that Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said would
cause “irrevocable damage” to the economy.  “Each country is going to have to go through a different
painful process,” President  Barack Obama  said yesterday in
 London  after discussions with Prime Minister  David Cameron .
While Obama’s plans are still deadlocked, Cameron is pressing
ahead with the U.K.’s deepest spending cuts since World War II.  Merkel said she will tell fellow G-8 leaders that while
Germany’s recovery from recession was initially export-led, two-
thirds of growth now comes from domestic demand even as her
government pursues deficit reduction. “That’s an important
message to the world economy,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
