IOI Corp.,  Malaysia ’s second-biggest
listed palm oil producer, said it has been working “closely”
with an industry group on a roadmap to address issues related to
allegations of illegal deforestation and disputes over land.  “This necessitates extra time beyond the stipulated
deadline of May 25,” Karen Liew, IOI’s corporate communications
manager said in a statement today. “The final decision will be
notified to all the stakeholders as well as the public soon.”  The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil group, or RSPO,
suspended IOI’s certification process after “several non-
governmental organizations, namely Migros, Friends of the Earth
and Grassroots, as well as the local community of Long Teran
Kanan in Sarawak” made allegations against the company.  The group needs more time to assess IOI’s response to the
complaints, it said on its website late yesterday. The company
on May 5 called for it to lift a suspension of its
sustainability certification.  To contact the reporter on this story:
