Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-biggest U.S.
discount retailer, said the “limited number” of potential
buyers for its credit-card portfolio may affect the chances of a
sale.  “Our ability to sell the portfolio is affected by the
limited number of potential buyers, an inactive market, the
complexity of the contemplated transaction, and the portfolio
size,” Minneapolis-based Target said today in a regulatory
filing.  Target, led by Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel,
announced plans to sell the portfolio in January, the same time
he disclosed the chain’s expansion beyond its U.S. home turf.
Target sold almost half its credit-card loans to  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  for $3.6 billion in 2008.  Target rose 5 cents to $49.41 at 3:39 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had declined 18
percent this year before today.  Eric Hausman, a spokesman for Target, didn’t immediately
return a request for comment.  The credit-card unit has bolstered profit over the past
year as more customers paid on time. In the quarter ended April
30, it accounted for 2.2 percent of revenue and 28 percent of
net income. Target’s net credit-card receivables totaled $5.72
billion at the end of last quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
