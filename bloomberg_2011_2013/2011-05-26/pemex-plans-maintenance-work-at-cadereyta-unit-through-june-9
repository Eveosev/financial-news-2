Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, said it halted a fluid catalytic cracker
plant for planned maintenance at its Cadereyta refinery.  The unit at the refinery outside of Monterrey, Mexico, has
been shut since April 24 and the maintenance work is scheduled
to run through June 9, said a press official who declined to be
identified, citing internal policy.  Cadereyta, Mexico’s third-largest refinery, processed
179,298 barrels of oil equivalent a day last year, about 34
percent below its 270,000 barrel-a-day capacity. A blast in
September cut output at the plant, which resumed normal
operations again in March, Chief Financial Officer Ignacio
Quesada said on a May 4 conference call with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
