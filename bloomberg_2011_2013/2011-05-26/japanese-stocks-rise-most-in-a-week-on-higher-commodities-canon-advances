Japanese stocks rose the most in more
than three weeks, driven by commodity companies, after oil and
copper prices increased and the yen weakened.  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662)  jumped 4.9 percent after
crude  oil prices  rose to the highest level since May 10 and a
brokerage raised its rating on the driller.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the
world’s No. 1 camera maker, climbed 5.8 percent on a plan to buy
back shares.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker,
advanced 1.2 percent after Deutsche Bank AG reiterated its
“buy” rating on the company, citing lower sales incentives.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.5 percent to 9,562.05
at the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
advanced 1.1 percent to 827.08, with seven stocks increasing for
every two that fell. Both gauges had the largest gain since May
2.  “The market is taking it positively that money is flowing
to risk assets, and that’s exceeding concern about the negative
impact of higher commodity prices on the economy,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $28 billion “Demand for
commodities will continue to increase in  developing countries  in
the medium- and long-term as the economy expands.”  The Topix has lost 11 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated  Japan ’s
northeast coast, crippling four of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s
nuclear reactors and disrupting supply chains at companies from
Toyota to chipmaker Renesas Electric Corp. Companies in the
Topix traded at 0.94 times estimated book value, compared with
2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Japan Petroleum Climbs  Commodity-related stocks led gains on the Topix. Japan
Petroleum Exploration, Japan’s second-largest oil driller,
climbed 4.9 percent to 3,725 yen. Larger rival  Inpex Corp. (1605) 
advanced 3.1 percent to 565,000 yen. Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.,
which develops and mines non-ferrous metals, increased 2 percent
to 1,294 yen.  Japan Petroleum Exploration also was boosted by Mitsubishi
UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. raising  its rating on the
company to “outperform” from “neutral.”  Crude oil for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to $101.32 a
barrel in  New York  yesterday, the highest settlement in more
than two weeks, as a report showed U.S. distillate fuel supplies
dropped to a two-year low. Copper futures for July delivery
jumped 2.3 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest gain since
May 18, after Deutsche Bank said prices will probably climb.  Biggest Support  “Rising commodities reduce concern that the stock market
driven by liquidity will falter,” said Mitsushige Akino, who
oversees about $600 million in  Tokyo  at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co.  Canon, which gets 80 percent of its revenue abroad, leapt
5.8 percent to 3,850 yen, and was the biggest single support for
the Nikkei and the Topix. The company said it plans to buy back
as much as 1.2 percent of its total shares for up to 50 billion
yen ($611 million).  The buyback is “positive” and the company is a top pick
among precision-equipment makers, Masahiro Shibano, a Tokyo-
based analyst for Citigroup, said in a report dated yesterday.
Shibano, who rates Canon a “buy,” said the camera-maker’s
profits are likely to rebound in the year ending in December
2012 as the effects fade from March’s earthquake.  Carmakers Advance  Toyota rose 1.2 percent to 3,355 yen. Rival Mazda Motor
Corp. jumped 6.9 percent to 201 yen, the biggest increase on the
Nikkei.  Advantest Corp. (6857) , the world’s No. 1 maker of chip-testing
equipment, climbed 2.5 percent to 1,491 yen.  The yen depreciated to 116.05 against the euro, compared
with 114.86 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday.
Against the dollar, Japan’s currency weakened to 82.09 from
81.83. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Carmakers also advanced as Deutsche Bank said sales
incentives Japanese carmakers paid to car dealers declined in
May, helping to offset lower auto sales. Deutsche Bank analyst
Kurt Sanger maintained his “buy” rating on Japan’s top three
carmakers, Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co. in a
report dated yesterday.  Ricoh Co., an office equipment maker, rose 4.1 percent to
885 yen. The company said it plans to cut about 9 percent of its
workforce over the next three years to revive profit growth amid
falling sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
