Protesters gathered for a second day
outside the country’s Parliament House in central  Athens  in a
demonstration against government austerity measures.  The crowd of protesters that call themselves “The
Exasperated of Syntagma,” has reached about 1,000 people so
far, even in rainy weather, according to an Athens police
spokesman, who wouldn’t be named in line with policy.  More than 15,000 people gathered in front of the Greek
Parliament yesterday evening to protest against the political
and economic situation in  Greece , while 50 of them stayed in the
main Athens square all night, according to the police spokesman.  The demonstration was organized through social-networking
websites with almost 40,000 people registered as ‘attending’ the
event on the website of  Facebook Inc. , following the example set
by Spanish demonstrators in  Madrid ’s Puerta Del Sol Square,
where they pitched tents on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
