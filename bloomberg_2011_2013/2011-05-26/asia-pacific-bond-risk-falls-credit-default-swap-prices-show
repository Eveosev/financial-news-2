The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment decreased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 110.5 basis points as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac
Banking Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  fell half a basis point
to 110 basis points as of 8:30 a.m. in Singapore, according to
BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 123.5
basis points as of 9:33 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices.  Credit-default swaps protect bond investors against default,
and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop
signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
