Johannesburg has set up a rolling
power-blackout schedule in case electricity demand exceeds
supply during winter, The Citizen reported, citing Louis
Pieterse, City Power’s director of engineering operations.  The schedule is updated annually, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. There is no indication yet that there will be
rolling blackouts, The Citizen cited Pieterse as saying.  Electricity supply will be tight over winter and Eskom
Holdings Ltd. has appealed to customers to conserve power, the
newspaper cited the state-owned utility’s spokeswoman Hilary
Joffe as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
