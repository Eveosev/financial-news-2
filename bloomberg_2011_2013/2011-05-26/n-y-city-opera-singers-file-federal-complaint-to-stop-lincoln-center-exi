The union representing  New York City
Opera  singers sought to block the troubled company’s plans to
leave its Lincoln Center home, saying the opera violated the
singers’ collective-bargaining rights by not consulting them.  The  American Guild of Musical Artists , which represents
singers, stage directors and stage managers, filed the charge
today with the  National Labor Relations Board .  Last week George Steel, the company’s general manager and
artistic director, said the company plans to leave the  David H.
Koch Theater  for a less costly home. It also plans to eliminate
employment guarantees for singers, according to the guild.  “This announcement was made without any prior notification
to, or bargaining with, the union,” the guild said in its
complaint, which was distributed to the press. “To date, the
company continues to refuse to bargain about the decision to
relocate and the effects of the relocation on the bargaining
unit.”  Maggie McKeon, a spokeswoman for City Opera, didn’t return
an e-mail or call.  To contact the writer on this story:
