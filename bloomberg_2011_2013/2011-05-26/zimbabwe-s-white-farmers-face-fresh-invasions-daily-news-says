White farmers in  Zimbabwe  are facing
fresh invasions by President  Robert Mugabe ’s loyalists following
the suspension of a regional court by the  Southern African
Development Community , the  Daily News  reported, citing Charles
Taffs, vice president of the Commercial Farmers’ Union.  The SADC suspended its Tribunal on May 19 after the
regional court twice ruled that the often violent invasion of
white farms in Zimbabwe was illegal, the Harare-based Daily News
said on its website. While Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front party refused to recognize the SADC
Tribunal, the court offered white farmers some hope, the Daily
News quoted Taffs as saying.  About 230 white farmers remain on their land, down from
about 4,500 in 2000 when Mugabe encouraged his supporters to
invade white-owned farms, the Daily News said, citing the CFU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
