The Polish zloty slid to the weakest
level in more than a month as a European leader said the
 International Monetary Fund  may not release aid to Greece.  The zloty declined for a sixth day, sliding 0.5 percent to
3.9864 per euro as of 5:30 p.m. in Warsaw, the lowest intraday
level since April 19 and the biggest drop among more than 20
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, said the IMF may not release its
portion of aid to Greece next month. A year after a 110 billion-
euro ($155 billion) bailout aimed to stem the spread of the
region’s debt crisis, Greece remains shut out of financial
markets. Portugal and Ireland have followed in needing rescues.  Poland’s government is “ready to take steps” if Greek
developments, which don’t pose a contagion risk to  Poland  for
now, require a response, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski said
today in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
