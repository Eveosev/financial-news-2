Philippine bonds rose, pushing the
five-year yield to a two-week low, after the central bank
signaled inflation may be starting to peak. The peso gained.  Consumer price gains will probably peak this quarter or
“shortly after,” central bank Deputy Governor  Diwa Guinigundo 
told reporters today in Manila. Inflation may range from 4.5
percent to 5.5 percent this month, Governor Amando Tetangco
said, citing some increases in costs of transport and school
items.  “We’re hoping inflation will peak soon and that may give
the market some breathing space,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-
income trader at Bank of Commerce in Manila.  The yield on the 9.125 percent September 2016 peso bond
fell 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 5.285 percent
as of 5:14 p.m. in Manila, the lowest level since May 11,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is ahead of the curve in
managing inflation, Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in an
interview with ABS-CBN News Channel yesterday. Consumer prices
rose 4.5 percent in April from a year earlier, the fastest pace
in a year. The top end of the central bank’s projection will be
the most since March 2009, based on official data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Comments from the finance secretary helped calm the
market,” Delfino said.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 43.427 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched 43.585 yesterday, the weakest
level since March 29.  To contact the reporter for this story:
