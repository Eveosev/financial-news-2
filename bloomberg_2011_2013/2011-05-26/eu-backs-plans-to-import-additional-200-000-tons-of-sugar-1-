European Union nations approved plans
to import an additional 200,000 metric tons of sugar at zero
duty to increase supplies in the 27-nation bloc.  EU states also backed a proposal for further imports at a
reduced duty via a tendering system, the European Commission,
the bloc’s executive arm, said today in an e-mailed statement.
The system would be in place from July to the end of the
marketing season in September.  Sugar prices have jumped as much as 70 percent in the EU
this year, Rabobank International said last week in a report,
even as futures slumped 17 percent in London and dropped 30
percent in  New York . Some EU regions have shortages, with
residents in  Poland  buying sugar from shops in  Germany  to resell
at home, the bank said.  “World market prices for sugar have been at a consistent
high level during the first months of the 2010-11 marketing
year, which has slowed down the pace of imports,” the
commission said.  The additional imports voted through today add to the
300,000 tons of duty-free sugar shipments approved earlier this
year by the EU. The import duty on the further tonnage will be
suspended from July 1 to Sept. 30, the commission said. It also
said responses are due by noon Brussels time on July 13 for the
first invitation to tender for imports.  “EU operators may submit offers for importing sugar at a
reduced import duty, and the commission will assess the volumes
and duties offered and decide which bids to accept based on the
evolution of the EU and world sugar market situation,” it said.  Both measures will be formally adopted in the next few
weeks, according to the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
