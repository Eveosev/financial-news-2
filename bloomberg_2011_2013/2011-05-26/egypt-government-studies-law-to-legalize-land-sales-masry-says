Egypt  is studying proposed
legislation to legalize land sales that violated the law under
previous governments to end land disputes in court,  Al Masry Al
Youm  reported, citing Omar El Shawadfy, head of the National
Center for State Land Utilization.  The law would put the blame for violating the law by
selling state land by direct order and not through public
auction on previous governments and shield investors from
prosecution, the Cairo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
