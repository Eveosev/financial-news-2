Greece  must seek an “orderly
restructuring” of its debt as the euro group’s “lend and
prey” approach is bound to fail, Nouriel Roubini said in a
 Handelsblatt  newspaper interview.  Greece could extend the maturities of its debt and seek
reduced interest on new bonds, said Roubini, the New York
University economist who predicted the global financial crisis.
This solution would reduce the risk of contagion as well as
losses that financial institutions must bear if the value of the
debt is cut, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
