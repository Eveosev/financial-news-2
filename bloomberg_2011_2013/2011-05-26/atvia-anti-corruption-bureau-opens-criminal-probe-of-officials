Latvia’s anti-corruption bureau is
investigating allegations of bribery, bribe taking and abuse of
power by unidentified state officials.  The agency opened “criminal processes” against the
officials on May 20, the Corruption Prevention and Combating
Bureau said today in a  statement  on its website. Agents
conducted searches at undisclosed companies and offices
yesterday, Latvian Television  reported .  “The evidence in our possession gives reason to believe
that public officials and officials holding a responsible
position” may have participated in operating businesses and
received dividends from secretly held shares in companies, the
bureau said. It is also looking into possible bribery and bribe
taking, according to the statement.  The Baltic country’s parliament today rejected a request
from the bureau to lift the immunity of opposition lawmaker
Ainars Slesers and allow a search of his home. Slesers wasn’t
mentioned in the bureau’s news release, which refers to an
unidentified member of parliament who may have influenced
decision-making at a number of companies and secretly held
shares in others.  “What I can unequivocally say is that the facts that are
mentioned do not correspond to the truth,” Slesers told
reporters in comments broadcast on  Latvian Television . “I’m not
an owner of any of the businesses mentioned.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
