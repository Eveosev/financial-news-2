Drake & Scull International (DSI)  advanced
the most in more than two months after the Dubai-based
construction and engineering company said a fully owned unit won
contracts valued at 150 million dirhams ($40.8 million).  The shares rallied 3 percent, the most since March 20, to
1.03 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai.  The contracts are for work in Europe,  China , the Middle
East and North Africa. The unit, Drake & Scull Water and Power
LLC, also completed the integration of Passavant-Roediger into
its business after buying it in 2009, the company said
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
