Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  lowered its
year-end forecast for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to 1,450
from 1,500 and reduced its 2012 earnings projection, citing
weakening economic estimates.  S&P 500 companies will post combined profit of $104 a share
next year, compared with Goldman Sachs’s prior estimate of $106,
according to  David Kostin , the New York-based equity strategist.
He maintained his 2011 earnings forecast for the S&P 500 of $96
a share.  “Our adjustments reflect a combination of developments
including recently lowered GDP growth estimates by our
economists in the U.S. and Asia and a significant increase in
our Brent oil price forecast,” Kostin wrote today in a note to
clients.  Goldman Sachs is forecasting U.S. real gross domestic
product growth of 2.6 percent in 2011 and 3.2 percent in 2012,
while it predicts global expansion will be 4.4 percent and 4.8
percent, respectively. The New York-based bank estimates that
the price of  Brent crude  will reach $120 by the end of this year
and $140 in 2012.  The  S&P 500  fell 3.2 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 through yesterday amid concern about  Europe ’s debt
crisis and weaker-than-forecast economic data. Still, the
benchmark gauge rose 5 percent since the end of 2010 on
government stimulus measures and higher-than-forecast profits.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than forecast, reflecting a smaller gain in
 consumer spending  than previously calculated. The revised rise
in GDP was the same as estimated last month and compared with a
3.1 percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent increase.  Before today, the average estimate of 13 strategists
tracked by Bloomberg called for the S&P 500 to rise 6.5 percent
in the last seven months of 2010 to 1,406. Corporate profits in
the benchmark index for U.S. equities may reach $104.73 a share
in the next 12 months as consumer demand pushes sales up 13
percent, according to data from about 9,000 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The income estimate rose 2.8 percent in the four
weeks ended May 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
