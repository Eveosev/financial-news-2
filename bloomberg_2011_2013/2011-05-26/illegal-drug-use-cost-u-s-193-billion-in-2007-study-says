Illegal drug use in the U.S. is
estimated to have cost the economy more than $193 billion in
2007, according to a government study.  The  study , released today by the  Justice Department ’s
National Drug Intelligence Center, includes costs associated
with crime, health and productivity.  The study says the cost of illegal drug use is comparable
with diabetes, which a 2008 government study said cost more than
$174 billion each year.  “This study shows the economic cost of illicit drug use is
significant,” said Michael F. Walther, director of the drug
intelligence center, in a statement. “This nation’s drug
problem is on par with other health problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
