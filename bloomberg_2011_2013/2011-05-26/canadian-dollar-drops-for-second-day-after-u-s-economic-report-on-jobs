The Canadian dollar slid for a second
straight day against the greenback after reports showed the  U.S.
economy  expanded at a slower rate than analysts forecast and
initial jobless claims unexpectedly increased and oil fell.  The loonie, as the currency is known, fell against all 16
of its major counterparts. The  Mexican peso  also slumped as the
reports fueled speculation about reduced demand from both
nations’ biggest trading partner.  Canada  sends 73 percent and
 Mexico  sends 80 percent of exports to the U.S. Oil is Canada’s
largest export.  “At the end of the day, Canada is connected at the hip
with the U.S.,” said Rahim Madhavji, president and head trader
at Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange in Toronto. “What we’re
seeing today is a little bit of shyness away from the Canadian
dollar simply because it’s a slightly risk-off story on the
Canadian domestic side.”  The Canadian currency was little changed at 97.77 cents
versus the  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 97.74. It
earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent. It touched 98.16 cents,
matching yesterday’s low, the weakest level since March 28. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0228.  The government two-year bond yield fell six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 1.529 percent and touched 1.525
percent, the lowest level since March 16. The 1.75 percent
security maturing in March 2013 rose 11 cents to C$100.39.  Canada will auction $700 million ($716 million) of real-
return bonds on June 1, according to a statement on the Bank of
Canada’s website. The inflation-linked securities mature in
December 2044.  ‘Super Linked’  Crude oil, Mexico’s second largest export, fell 1.1 percent
to $100.17 a barrel in  New York , from $101.32 yesterday. The
price of oil has fallen 12 percent in May, coinciding with a 3.4
percent loss month-to-date in the loonie against the dollar.  America’s gross domestic product grew at 1.8 percent annual
rate in the first quarter, U.S. Commerce Department figures
showed today. The gain was the same as estimated last month and
compared with a 3.1 percent increase in the prior quarter. The
median forecast of 82 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a revised 2.2 percent gain.  U.S. jobless claims unexpectedly increased by 10,000 to
424,000 in the week ended May 21, the Labor Department said in a
separate report. The median forecast of economist in a Bloomberg
News survey was for a drop to 404,000.  “The Canadian economy is super-linked to the U.S. economy,
so any weakness in U.S. data is often viewed as bad for Canada,
and that’s the case today,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing
director of currency research at Nomura Holdings Inc. in New
York. “Both the GDP and the claims were worse overall. The data
picture has been on the soft side now for a few weeks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
