BP Plc (BP/) â€™s refinery in Carson,
California, had a mechanical issue that led to the release of an
unknown amount of sulphur oxide at 3:44 p.m. local time,
according to a  notice  filed with state regulators.  Scott Dean , a BP spokesman, was not immediately available
for comment. BP told regulators earlier today it planned to
flare gases at the refinery from May 27 through June 3.  The refinery has a capacity of 265,000 barrels per day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
