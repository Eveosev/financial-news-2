The  United Nations  is concerned about
the movement of weapons and fighters around West Africa amid a
crisis in Libya and following the end of a civil war in  Ivory
Coast , according to Said Djinnit, the organization’s special
envoy for the region.  The regional instability could become a “contagion” before
elections in Guinea, Liberia and Senegal, which are due over the
next 12 months, Djinnit told reporters in Dakar today.  “This is a source of dire concern for all the countries in
the sub region,” he said.  Guinea, Mali, Niger, Chad and Burkina Faso are potential
“regrouping zones” for Libyan fighters amid a rebellion, which
is backed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, to oust
leader  Muammar Qaddafi , Djinnit said.  Liberia, which is holding a presidential election in
October, has seen an influx of armed fighters fleeing
neighboring Ivory Coast after the April 11 capture of ex-
President Laurent Gbagbo, he said.  The mercenaries entered Ivory Coast following that
country’s disputed November vote, when Gbagbo refused to cede
power of the world’s top cocoa producer to Alassane Ouattara. At
least 220 civilians were killed by the retreating fighters,
Ivorian Prime Minister  Guillaume Soro  said in a May 15
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
