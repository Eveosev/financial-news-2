Natural gas futures dropped from a
three-week high after a government report showed that U.S.
inventories increased more than forecast last week.  Gas declined 1.2 percent after the Energy Department said
stockpiles rose 105 billion cubic feet in the week ended May 20
to 2.024 trillion cubic feet. Analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg showed an expected gain of 95 billion. A separate
survey of Bloomberg users showed an increase of 97 billion.  “It was a little bit surprising to the upside, and maybe
it’s a measure of the strength on the supply side,” said  Martin King , an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. “It’s
a question of how fast the year-over-year deficit is going to
close.”  Natural gas for June delivery fell 5.3 cents to settle at
$4.326 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Gas yesterday closed at the highest price
since May 4. Gas is down 1.8 percent this year.  The June contract expired today. Gas for July delivery
decreased 6.3 cents to $4.36.  The five-year average storage change for the week is an
increase of 95 billion cubic feet, department data showed.
Stockpile levels rose 100 billion the same week last year,
according to department data.  Supplies were 1.3 percent below the five-year average last
week, narrower than a deficit of 1.8 percent the previous week.
Storage levels were 10 percent below the level a year earlier
compared with 11 percent in the previous week.  Nuclear Power  U.S. nuclear power production increased by 1,301 megawatts,
or 1.6 percent, from yesterday to 80,783 megawatts, or 80
percent of capacity, the most since April 1, according to a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Gas also fell on concern slower economic recovery will
reduce demand for the industrial fuel.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than forecast, Commerce Department figures
showed today in  Washington .  More Americans than expected filed applications for
 unemployment benefits  last week, a sign the labor market is
struggling to gain momentum.  Gas industrial demand will rise to 18.43 billion cubic feet
a day this year from last year’s 18.08 billion, the Energy
Department said in  a monthly report  on May 10.  Demand from  power plants  will increase to 20.29 billion
cubic feet a day from 20.21 billion in 2010.  Hotter Weather  Gas rose earlier as National Weather Service forecasts
showed temperatures will be above normal in the East, Midwest
and South next week.  The high temperature in  New York  on May 31 will be 87
degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 12 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
246,080 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 307,000. Volume was 216,650 yesterday. Open interest was
912,038 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
943,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
