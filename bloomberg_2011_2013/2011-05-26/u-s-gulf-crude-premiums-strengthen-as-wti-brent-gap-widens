U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between West  Texas  Intermediate and Brent crudes
widened for the fourth straight day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for July
delivery increased 85 cents to $14.46 a barrel. The differential
for the contract nearest to expiration reached a record $15.94
on Feb. 16.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium fell 25 cents to $15.60
over WTI at 11:47 a.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
strengthened 70 cents to $15.45 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained 20 cents to $9.20 a barrel, and Poseidon’s premium
rose 25 cents to $8.75 over WTI.  Thunder Horse’s premium fell 20 cents to $13.15 a barrel
over WTI, and Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened 70 cents
to $8.20.  West Texas Sour’s discount widened 10 cents to $2.70 a
barrel. The grade has been tracking more closely to its
historical average discount over WTI because it’s delivered in
Midland, Texas, close to Cushing,  Oklahoma .  The premium for Syncrude, a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from  tar sands  in  Alberta , increased 50 cents to $10 a
barrel.  The discount for Western  Canada  Select widened 15 cents to
$17.50 a barrel. Plains Midstream Canada reopened the portion of
its Rainbow pipeline from Nipisi to  Edmonton  yesterday after
shutting the line May 15 because of wildfires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
