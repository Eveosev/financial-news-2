The  Dallas Mavericks  rallied to beat
the Oklahoma City Thunder 100-96 and advance to the National
Basketball Association Finals for the second time.  The Mavericks trailed by eight points with 8:03 to play at
the American Airlines Center in Dallas last night before
outscoring the Thunder 21-9 to win the best-of-seven Western
Conference finals by four games to one.  Dallas will play the  Miami Heat  or the  Chicago Bulls  for
the NBA title. The Heat lead the Bulls 3-1 in games and can wrap
up the Eastern Conference title with a win in Chicago today.
Dallas won the first two games of the 2006 NBA Finals against
the Heat before losing four in a row.  “Five years ago we had a great chance, we were right there
where we wanted to be and just couldn’t close it out,”  Dirk Nowitzki  said in a televised courtside interview. “We’re back
again and hopefully with a better result.”  Nowitzki scored five of the Mavericks’ final eight points
last night and gave his team the lead for the first time in the
fourth quarter with a 3-point jumper with 1:14 remaining.  Nowitzki and Shawn Marion were the top scorers for the
Mavericks with 26 points each.  The Thunder, who turned over the ball six times in the
fourth quarter, were led by Russell Westbrook with 31 points,
while  Kevin Durant  and James Harden each added 23 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
