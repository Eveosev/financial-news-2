Daily Mail and General Trust Plc , the
publisher of Britain’s  Daily Mail  newspaper, dropped the most
since November in  London  trading after the company said it
remains “cautious” about the full-year outlook.  With “volatile and uncertain market conditions” at its
U.K. consumer businesses, which rely heavily on advertising, the
company will focus on driving growth through new products and
investments, Daily Mail Chief Executive Officer Martin Morgan
said in a statement. Ad revenue for April and the first three
weeks of May were below last year’s level, he said, without
disclosing figures.  The shares  fell as much as 6.5 percent to 453.3 pence and
were 4.2 percent lower as of 9:22 a.m.  The company will pursue cost cuts and debt reduction and
expects to post growth for the full year versus 2010, Morgan
said. Daily Mail’s U.K. consumer media operations include the
Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday newspapers.  Daily Mail today reported a 3 percent rise in adjusted
first-half revenue to 991 million pounds ($1.6 billion), while
adjusted earnings per share rose 22 percent to 23.6 pence a
share. Adjusted earnings figures are before exceptional items,
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, and amortization
of intangible assets from business combinations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
