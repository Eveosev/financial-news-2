Russia’s United Co. Rusal, the
world’s largest aluminum producer, will keep its stake in OAO
GMK Norilsk Nickel even as shareholders feud for control of the
world’s largest producer of nickel.  “We believe in this company,” Maxim Sokov, Rusal’s deputy
chief executive, told Pimm Fox on Bloomberg Television’s
“Taking Stock.” “And if you sell, what would you do with the
money? It’s a first-class asset. It’s hard to buy something of
this quality.”  Rusal, controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, owns a 25
percent stake in Norilsk and has rejected three offers since
October to sell holdings in the nickel company for as much as
$12.8 billion, even as Rusal investors Mikhail Prokhorov and
Viktor Vekselberg push for a sale. A decision to exit the
company would bring an end to an ownership feud with  Vladimir Potanin , whose Interros Holding Co. owns about 30 percent of
Norilsk.  Norilsk investors are scheduled to elect a 13-member board
at an annual  shareholders’ meeting  on June 21. Rusal’s
nominations to the board include Deripaska, documents obtained
by Bloomberg earlier this month show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
