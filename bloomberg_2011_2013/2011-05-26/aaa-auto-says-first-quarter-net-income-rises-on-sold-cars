AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) , a chain of used
car dealerships in central and eastern  Europe , said first-
quarter profit rose after the company sold more cars.  Net income for the first three months was 690,000 euros
($971,244), compared with 476,000 euros a year earlier, the
Amsterdam-based company said in an e-mailed statement. Revenue
rose 61.2 percent to 63.3 million euros.  The results show a “solid growth” in all key financial
measures as demand for used cars revived amid the economic
recovery, the company said in the statement. AAA said it expects
car sales to grow 5 percent in 2011 from a year ago.  AAA Auto Group NV withdrew from  Hungary  and other countries
in the region as the global economic crisis cut sales, pushing
it into losses. Car sales grew 7 percent last year and the
company is ready to expand its business in the  Czech Republic ,
Slovakia and return to other markets.  AAA said in March it is targeting 10 percent growth in its
sales for 2011 and to open a Russian dealership in the fourth
quarter. It may also return to Hungarian market by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
