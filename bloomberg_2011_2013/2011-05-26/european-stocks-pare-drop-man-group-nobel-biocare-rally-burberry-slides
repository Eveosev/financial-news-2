European stocks pared losses as
basic-resource shares advanced, offsetting a report that showed
the  U.S. economy  grew slower than economists had predicted.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  jumped 3.3 percent after the world’s biggest
publicly traded hedge fund manager said profit fell less than
estimated and client assets increased. Nobel Biocare Holding AG,
the world’s second-largest maker of dental implants by sales,
surged 7.5 percent after Morgan Stanley recommended the shares.
Burberry Group Plc, the U.K.’s largest luxury retailer, tumbled
4 percent.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost less than 0.1
percent to 277.28 at 2:43 p.m. in London. The gauge has risen
5.8 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors
speculated that company profits and government stimulus measures
will keep the economic recovery on track.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
