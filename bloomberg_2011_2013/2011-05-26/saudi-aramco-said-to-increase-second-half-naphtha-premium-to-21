Saudi Aramco , the world’s largest oil
exporter, raised the premium for naphtha to be delivered to
Asian buyers in the second half of this year by as much as 36
percent, according to two people involved in the negotiations.  The company agreed with buyers to sell A-180 grade naphtha
at $21 a metric ton more than its benchmark formula, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were
confidential. Aramco’s Rabigh grade will sell for $20 a ton over
the benchmark, the people said. That’s an increase of $4 over
the price for each type during the first half of this year.  Aramco also boosted the selling price for naphtha from
Jubail by $4 to $19 a ton over the benchmark formula, the people
said. The price for the A-310 grade rose $5 to a $19 a-ton
premium, according to the people.  A Dhahran, Saudi Arabia-based Aramco official, who asked
not to be identified in line with company policy, declined to
comment on the transactions.  Prices for the oil product, used to make petrochemicals and
gasoline, have risen as crude gained after unrest in the Middle
East cut exports from producing countries such as  Libya .  Aramco sells naphtha on an annual basis under contracts
that allow for the renegotiation of terms at mid-year. Delivery
is on a free-on-board basis, requiring buyers to pay shipping
costs. Its benchmark formula contains Middle Eastern prices
