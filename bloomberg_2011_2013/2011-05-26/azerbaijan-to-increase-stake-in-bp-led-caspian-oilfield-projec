The State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, also
known as Socar, plans to buy 1.6 percent of an oil development
operated by BP Plc in the  Caspian Sea , to boost ownership in
projects with international partners.  Baku-based Socar will buy part of the stake in the Azeri-
Chirag-Guneshli project that BP agreed to acquire from Devon
Energy, Socar President Rovnaq Abdullayev said in remarks
reported by the APA news agency today, which were confirmed by
Nizamaddin Quliyev, a company spokesman.  The state company is willing to purchase any shares offered
by other partners, according to Abdullayevâ€™s comments. Tamam Bayatly, a BP spokeswoman in Baku, declined to comment.  Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli, also known as ACG, is operated by
BP, which holds 34.1 percent of the shares. Socar holds 10
percent. Devon said in August that it sold its stake to BP for
about $2 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
