Rexnord Holdings Inc., the industrial
components maker owned by Apollo Management LP, is seeking to
raise $700 million in an initial public offering.  The  Milwaukee , Wisconsin-based company plans to use $300
million of the proceeds to redeem notes. Its private-equity
owner Apollo will also receive a fee, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission today. The stock will be
listed under the ticker RXN, according to the filing.  Rexnord had a net loss of $51.3 million in the year ended
March 31 2011, compared with a profit of $88.1 million a year
earlier, according to the filing. Net sales rose to $1.7 billion
from $1.5 billion.  Apollo bought Rexnord from  Carlyle Group  for $1.8 billion,
including debt, in 2006. Rexnord had previously withdrawn its
registration to raise as much as $750 million in an IPO in
October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
