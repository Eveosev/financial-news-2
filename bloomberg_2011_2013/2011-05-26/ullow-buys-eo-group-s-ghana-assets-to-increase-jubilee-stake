Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  agreed to buy the
offshore Ghanaian interests of EO Group Ltd. for $305 million in
cash and shares, increasing its stake in West Africa’s biggest
oil discovery in a decade.  The acquisition will boost Tullow’s interest in the West
Cape Three Points license by 3.5 percentage points to 26.4
percent, and the Jubilee oil field by 1.75 percentage points to
36.5 percent, according to a statement today.  “This purchase further demonstrates Tullow’s long-term
commitment to Ghana and our belief in its significant remaining
potential,” said Chief Executive Officer Aidan Heavey.  Tullow’s second deal of the week follows the 300 million
euro ($424 million) purchase of Nuon Exploration and Production
BV, boosting its North Sea output by 70 percent. Jubilee, which
is operated by Tullow, is pumping about 70,000 barrels of oil a
day after production started last year.  Tullow’s partners in  Ghana  are Kosmos Energy Ltd., Anadarko
Petroleum Corp., and Ghana National Petroleum Corp. Jubilee,
which was discovered in 2007, is expected to produce the
equivalent of 120,000 barrels a day by mid-year and has
potential resources of about 1.8 billion barrels.  The West Cape Three Points block contains other assets that
Tullow plans to develop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
