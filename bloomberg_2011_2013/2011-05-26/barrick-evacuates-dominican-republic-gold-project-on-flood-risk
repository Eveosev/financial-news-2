Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, said workers and residents are
being evacuated amid flooding risks where its Pueblo Viejo
project in the  Dominican Republic  is under construction.  The mine is located near the Llagal dam that is being built
and is at risk of bursting its banks amid heavy rains, Toronto-
based Barrick  said today  on its regional website. Barrick holds
a 60 percent stake in the mine while  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  owns the
remaining of the project.  The construction of the Pueblo Viejo mine was part of
Barrick’s $4.65 billion capital expenditures budget for this
year. The Dominican Republic project may hold 23.7 million
ounces of gold, the company has said in a statement on its
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
