Polish day-ahead electricity fell in
the past week as exports declined and longer days damped use.  Next-day baseload power decreased 0.7 percent to 213.68
zloty ($76.40) a megawatt-hour in the week ending today,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on Polish Power
Exchange data.  Demand for electricity at 8.30 p.m. local time yesterday
was 18,540 megawatts, down 1.5 percent from a week earlier,
according to  system load data .  As much as 980 megawatts of Polish electricity was
scheduled to be exported to  Germany , the Czech Republic and
Slovakia tomorrow morning, down 300 megawatts from a week ago,
according to data from PSE Operator.  Maximum temperatures in Warsaw may rise to 30 degrees
Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) on May 31 from todayâ€™s 20 degrees,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg. Hot weather
in the summer tends to boost power demand due to air
conditioning use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
