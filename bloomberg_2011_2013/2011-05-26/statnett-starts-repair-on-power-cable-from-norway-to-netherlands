Statnett SF has started repairs on
the  NorNed  power cable between  Norway  after it found a fault
last month about 300 meters (328 yards)from the Dutch coast.  “Repair time is depending on weather conditions,” the
Norwegian grid operator said today in a message via the Nord
Pool Spot AS power exchange. The Oslo-based company owns the
cable jointly with Tennet Holding BV, its Dutch equivalent.  The 700-megawatt cable, the world’s longest subsea
interconnector, closed at 5:45 p.m. local time on April 18.
Statnett’s estimated restart date is 27 June, according to
today’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
