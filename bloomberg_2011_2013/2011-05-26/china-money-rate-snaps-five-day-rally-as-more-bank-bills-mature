China ’s money-market rate dropped,
snapping a five-day advance, on speculation bills and repurchase
agreements due next week will add funds to the financial system
and ease a cash crunch.  The seven-day repurchase rate retreated from the highest
level in three months on optimism government debt and repurchase
agreements worth 255 billion yuan ($39.3 billion) are set to
mature next week, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist at
Credit Agricole SA in  Hong Kong . That compares with 63 billion
yuan of redemptions this week, he said.  “With the higher redemption level next week it’s not
difficult to push rates down from such elevated levels,”
Kowalczyk said. “The central bank also cut down on open-market
operations this week to alleviate the acute cash shortage
related to this week’s tax payments by financial institutions.”  The seven-day repo rate dropped 24 basis points to 5.08
percent as of 11:31 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center. It
touched 5.50 percent yesterday, the highest level since Feb. 23.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, declined one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.50 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 fell one basis point to 3.63 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  -- Andrea Wong . Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
