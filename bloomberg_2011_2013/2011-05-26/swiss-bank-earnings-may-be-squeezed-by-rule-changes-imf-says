Swiss banks, including  UBS AG (UBSN)  and
 Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , may see earnings come under pressure
from stricter capital rules and changes to banking secrecy, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  “Profitability is likely to be muted going forward,” the
Washington-based fund said in a report today. “A possible fall
in tax sensitive wealth management flows over the medium term
would also weigh on profits.”  The strength of the Swiss franc and regulatory uncertainty
about banking secrecy and tax environments may result in
consolidation among private banks, the IMF said. Some observers
estimate the amount of undeclared money in Switzerland at
between 300 billion francs ($347 billion) and 1 trillion francs,
the Fund said.  Switzerland agreed in March 2009 to comply with
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development standards
to avoid being blacklisted as a tax haven. Outflows from Swiss
private banks as a result of these tax issues would be masked by
inflows related to the country’s “safe-haven attributes,” the
IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
