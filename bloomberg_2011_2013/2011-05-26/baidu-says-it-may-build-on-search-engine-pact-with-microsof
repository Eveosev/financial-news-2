Baidu Inc., owner of  China ’s most-
popular search engine, said it may expand its partnership with
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  as it steps up plans to offer services outside
its home market.  Baidu “won’t rule out” further collaboration with
Microsoft, with which it has an existing agreement on the Bing
search engine in China, Haoyu Shen, senior vice president at the
Chinese company, said in an interview in Beijing today. He
declined to elaborate.  Working with Microsoft may help Baidu speed up its overseas
expansion after the Beijing-based company overcame competition
from  Google Inc. (GOOG)  to dominate the industry in China. Baidu is
developing products in 12 foreign languages, said Shen, who
declined to say when they will be rolled out.  Baidu is close to signing a strategic agreement on search-
engine operations with Microsoft, Donews.com reported on May 13,
citing people it didn’t identify. Shen declined to comment on
the report.  Google, owner of the world’s most popular search engine,
accounted for 19.2 percent of China’s search market by revenue
in the first-quarter, declining from 19.6 percent three months
earlier, according to research company Analysys International.
Baidu’s market share rose to 75.8 percent from 75.5 percent,
while Microsoft Bing has less than 1 percent market share,
according to Analysys.  To contact the reporter on this story:
