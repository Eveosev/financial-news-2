Asia stocks rose, driving the
regional benchmark index to its best performance in a month, as
raw material producers increased after oil and copper prices
rallied.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-biggest mining company
by sales, climbed 1.9 percent. Bigger rival  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
advanced 2.2 percent after Deutsche Bank AG upgraded basic
resources to “overweight” and named BHP among its top picks.
 Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera maker, jumped 5.8 percent
on its plan to buy back shares. Ricoh Co., a Japanese office
equipment maker, surged 4.1 percent after announcing job cuts.  “Rising commodities reduce concern that the stock market
driven by liquidity will falter,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “However, with increasing economic reports
showing deterioration in the U.S., anxiety the economy will slow
will likely limit gains in stocks.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1.5 percent to 133, set
for its biggest advance since April 20 and its highest close
since May 20, as of 5:21 p.m. in Tokyo. More than three stocks
gained for each that fell on gauge, which last week slid for a
third straight week as Greece’s debt crisis intensified,  Japan ’s
economy contracted, and disappointing U.S. economic data fueled
concern about the global recovery.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 1.5 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index added 0.7 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai
Composite Index declined 0.2 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 1.7 percent, the most since Dec. 2. Vietnam’s VN
Index climbed 3 percent, its first advance in 11 days.  South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  surged 2.8 percent, the most
since June 2009, as Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc.
predicted the nation’s stocks will rise on improving earnings
and attractive valuations.  U.S. Futures  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4
percent today. In  New York , the index gained 0.3 percent to
1,320.47 yesterday as commodity shares rallied on expectations
for higher raw material prices even as reports indicated the
 U.S. economy  is weakening.  A report showed that orders for durable goods dropped　more
than forecast in April in the U.S., reflecting less demand for
aircraft and disruptions in supplies of auto parts stemming from
the　earthquake in Japan. Other data showed manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region grew in May at the slowest pace in seven
months, while a measure of the industry in the Richmond,
Virginia, region contracted.  Gauges of information technology companies, consumer
discretionary firms and raw material producers led the advance
among the 10 industry groups in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, all
of which rose.  Oil, Copper  Rio Tinto climbed 1.9 percent to A$80.25 in Sydney. BHP
Billiton, the world’s largest mining company and Australia’s No.
1 oil and gas producer, increased 2.2 percent to A$43.91.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s No. 1 producer of the metal, rose
1.6 percent to HK$25.45 in Hong Kong.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the nation’s
biggest offshore oil and gas producer, added 2.9 percent to
HK$18.68.  Crude oil for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to $101.32 a
barrel in New York yesterday, the highest settlement since May
10, as a report showed that U.S. distillate fuel supplies
dropped to a two-year low. Copper futures for July delivery
jumped 2.3 percent in New York yesterday, the biggest gain since
May 18, as Deutsche Bank AG said prices probably will climb.  Resources companies will be buoyed as the world economy
grows 4 percent this year, while pressure for interest-rate
increases to slow Chinese expansion is diminishing as inflation
peaks, Gareth Evans, a London-based analyst at Deutsche Bank,
wrote in a note to clients yesterday. Basic resources will
deliver a return on equity of 20 percent next year, the bank
said. Its top picks include BHP and Xstrata Plc.  Graincorp Profit Surge  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500 and 11.1 times
for the Stoxx 600.  GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , the largest grain handler in eastern
Australia, jumped 8 percent to A$8.38 in Sydney. Recent
speculation that the company may be takeover target is
“understandable,” given the attractiveness of the business,
Chief Executive Officer Alison Watkins said on a conference
call. The company raised its full-year profit forecast as much
as 43 percent on expected higher earnings from exports and
storage.  Austar United Communications Ltd., the second-biggest
provider of pay television in Australia, surged 7.9 percent to
A$1.365 after receiving a A$1.9 billion ($2 billion) conditional
takeover offer from larger rival Foxtel.  Canon advanced 5.8 percent to 3,850 yen. The company said
yesterday it plans to buy back as much as 1.2 percent of its
shares for up to 50 billion yen ($611 million). The shares
purchases are scheduled from today through July 28, it said.  Best, Worst Performers  Ricoh jumped 4.1 percent to 885 yen after the company said
it plans to cut about 10,000 jobs, or 9 percent of its workforce
over the next three years to revive profit growth amid falling
sales.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., South Korea’s
third-biggest shipbuilder by sales, advanced 7.1 percent to
42,200 won in  Seoul . The company said it received an order to
build two liquefied natural gas carriers from Awilco LNG AS of
 Norway . Financial details were not disclosed.  Yoosung Enterprise Co., the supplier of auto parts to
 Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , surged 15 percent to
4,575 won. The company resumed production yesterday after police
broke up a week-long strike at its plant that disrupted
production at South Korea’s largest automakers. Hyundai Motor,
the nation’s biggest carmaker, climbed 5.6 percent to 243,500
won, while its affiliate Kia Motors increased 6.7 percent to
74,900 won.  Among stocks that declined, Chaoda Modern Agriculture
(Holdings) Ltd., a fruit and vegetable grower, slumped 22
percent to HK$3.62, the worst performer on the Asia-Pacific
gauge.  The company overstated the area of its farm land in Beijing
and the Chinese province of Hebei, Next Magazine reported today,
citing managers at the production bases. “The contents of the
article are not factually accurate and true,” Chaoda said in a
statement to the Hong Kong exchange. “The company reserves all
its right to take legal action in connection with the article.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
