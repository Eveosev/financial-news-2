Import-price inflation in  Germany ,
 Europe â€™s largest economy, slowed more than economists forecast
in April.  Import-price inflation eased to 9.4 percent from 11.3
percent in March, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said today. Economists forecast a slowdown to 9.9 percent,
according to the median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. In the month, prices rose 0.3 percent, less than half
the 0.7 percent gain forecast by economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
