Russia  will start full operations
soon at  Iran ’s Bushehr nuclear reactor, the Persian Gulf
nation’s first atomic power station, a senior official said.  “It will happen very soon because everything is
practically ready for it,” Nikolai Spassky, deputy head of
Rosatom Corp., Russia’s nuclear holding company, told reporters
today at the Group of Eight summit in Deauville,  France .  Iran’s envoy to the  International Atomic Energy Agency ,
Aliashgar Soltanieh, in March asked Russia to start Bushehr on
time. The head of the Iranian parliament’s energy committee,
Hamid-Reza Katouzian, said April 5 that Iran was concerned about
delays to the project and that Russia didn’t seem to have the
will to cooperate on the launch of the reactor.  Talks between Iran and world powers on its nuclear program
have stalled. The country is under four sets of United Nations
sanctions because of concern that it is using its atomic
facilities to develop weapons. Iran, with the world’s second-
largest natural gas reserves, says it’s enriching uranium to
fuel nuclear reactors for civilian energy projects.  Russian and Iranian officials held a ceremony to mark the
opening of the nuclear plant on Aug. 21. Iran began loading fuel
into the reactor in October, a process it said ended about
a month later. In November, officials said the country aimed to
start the plant by late January. Iranian Foreign Minister  Ali
Akbar Salehi  said in late January that the facility would be
ready to generate electricity by April 9, adding that safety was
of paramount importance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
