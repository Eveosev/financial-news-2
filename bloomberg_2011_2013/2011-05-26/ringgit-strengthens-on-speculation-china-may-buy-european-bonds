Malaysia’s ringgit advanced,
rebounding from a two-month low yesterday, as speculation the
Chinese government may buy European bailout bonds bolstered
demand for emerging-market assets.  The currency strengthened the most this year as the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of stocks gained after  Fitch Ratings  said
it’s not planning any downgrades of German banks because of
 Greece ’s debt crisis. The European Union sold 4.75 billion euros
($6.7 billion) of five-year bonds yesterday to help bailout
Ireland and Portugal, with buyers from Asia accounting for 16
percent of the issue.  “The ringgit’s rise is due to the rally in the euro,”
said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “I don’t think the
ringgit will strengthen too much in the near-term as the debt
crisis in  Europe  is still not resolved.”  The ringgit advanced 0.7 percent to 3.0405 per dollar as of
4.23 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency fell 0.4 percent yesterday.  Asian investors, including the Chinese government, may
comprise a “strong proportion” of the purchasers of Portuguese
bailout bonds when the European Financial Stability Facility
begins selling them in June, the Financial Times reported
citing, Klaus Regling, the EFSF’s chief executive officer. The
report prompted buying in the euro.  Malaysian  government bonds  were little changed. The yield
on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 held at 3.32 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
