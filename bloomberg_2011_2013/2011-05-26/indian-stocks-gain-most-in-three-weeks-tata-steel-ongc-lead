India’s benchmark stock index
rebounded from a two-month low, rising the most in three weeks
as earnings reports by  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  eased
concern higher  interest rates  will curb profit growth.  Tata Steel, the nation’s largest producer, advanced 2.3
percent after reporting a 72 percent increase in fourth-quarter
profit to $937 million, aided by rising prices and the sale of a
unit in the U.K. Oil &  Natural Gas  Corp., India’s largest state-
run energy explorer, rallied 4.6 percent after an oil ministry
official said the government may raise diesel prices, a move
that could reduce the company’s share of the cost to subsidize
fuel prices. Coal India, the biggest producer of the fuel,
climbed 3.1 percent after profit exceeded forecasts.  “Tata Steel’s numbers have been good and they are likely
to ease some investor concerns,” said Kishor Ostwal, managing
director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a publicly traded
equities research provider in  Mumbai . “The ongoing concerns
like inflation and interest rates continue, but are getting
priced in due to the recent declines.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index gained 197.40, or
1.1 percent, to 18,044.64 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, its
steepest climb since May 6. The gauge yesterday closed at its
lowest level since March 21. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the
National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. added 1.2 percent to
5,412.35. Its June futures traded at 5,395.95. The BSE 200 Index
advanced 0.9 percent to 2,230.47.  The Sensex has slid 12 percent this year on concern higher
borrowing costs will hurt corporate earnings. Equities on the
gauge are valued at an average 14.5 times estimated profit, down
from 21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high. The MSCI
Emerging Markets Index trades at 11 times earnings.  ‘Too Cautious’  Fourth-quarter earnings for companies in the Sensex that
have already reported so far are exceeding analyst estimates,
Citigroup Inc. said in a report dated yesterday, adding that
it’s positive on Indian stocks.  “The market is probably too cautious on the impact on
growth and earnings,” Citigroup said, repeating its prediction
for 18 percent to 19 percent profit growth for the year to March
12, 2012.  India ’s central bank on May 3 raised rates for a ninth time
since March 2010 to curb rising prices, and Governor Duvvuri Subbarao predicted inflation will stay “elevated” until
September.  Overseas investors bought a net 351 million rupees ($7.8
million) of Indian stocks on May 24, paring their outflows from
equities this year to 30.8 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  Beating Estimates  Tata Steel climbed 2.3 percent to 574.15 rupees, its
highest close since May 20. The company made a one-time gain of
$561 million selling its Teesside Cast Products unit to
 Thailand ’s Sahaviriya Steel Industries Public Co. at the end of
March, Chatterjee told reporters in Mumbai yesterday.  Coal India jumped 3.1 percent to 388.95 rupees, the
steepest climb since May 9. Profit in the quarter ended March 31
was 42.2 billion rupees ($931 million), Chairman N.C. Jha told
reporters in Kolkata yesterday, without providing year-earlier
figures. The mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was a profit of 37.1 billion rupees.  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , the energy explorer that Vedanta
Resources Plc plans to acquire, advanced 1.6 percent to 343.45
rupees, the highest close in three weeks. The company posted a
10-fold increase in fourth-quarter profit to a record 24.6
billion rupees ($543 million) after crude oil production and
prices rose. The average profit estimate of 20 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg was 23 billion rupees.  ONGC, Reliance  Oil & Natural Gas rallied 4.6 percent to 274.45 rupees, its
biggest jump since May 4. Open interest, or the number of
contracts held by traders, in June futures surged 61 percent to
8,140, data on the Bloomberg shows.  The government may raise diesel prices when a panel of
ministers meet on June 9, said the official, asking not to be
identified. Indian state refiners sell diesel, kerosene and
cooking gas at prices set by the government to curb inflation.
They are partly compensated by getting discounts on crude
supplies from ONGC and cash from the government.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s largest company by
market value, gained 3.1 percent to 933.85 rupees, the steepest
gain since Dec. 10. The government may allow the company to
charge market prices for natural gas sold to users other than
fertilizer, power and for use in homes, the Economic Times
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Two phone calls to Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy’s office
outside office hours went unanswered. Reliance spokesman  Manoj
Warrier  didn’t answer a call made to his mobile phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
