(Corrects fuel in first paragraph of story originally
published on May 26.)  India  may increase diesel, kerosene
and cooking gas prices to support state-run refiners facing
revenue losses of 2 trillion rupees ($44 billion) this fiscal
year, an oil ministry official said today. Energy shares surged.  A panel of ministers led by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will meet on June 9 and discuss prices following crude
oil’s rise, the person said, asking not to be identified before
a public announcement.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. was the biggest gainer on the
benchmark  stock index  on expectations higher fuel prices will
lower its subsidy burden. Mukherjee faces a dilemma as he aims
to cut the government’s fuel subsidy bill, which topped 400
billion rupees last year, while curbing consumer prices that
jumped 8.66 percent in April.  “A diesel price increase seems imminent as refiners’
revenue losses are very large and oil prices continue to be
high,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Wealth Management
Services Ltd., said by telephone from  New Delhi . “The
government has to balance fiscal deficit, growth, and the
immediate monster of inflation.”  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner, increased
gasoline prices on May 15 for the first time in four months to
cut losses from selling fuels below cost. That was less than the
required 10.5 rupees a liter, the company said in a statement on
May 14.  Oil Prices  State-owned ONGC, the nation’s biggest energy explorer,
rose 4.6 percent to 274.45 rupees in Mumbai trading today,
ending four days of losses. The company sells crude oil at a
discount to the state refiners to partly compensate them for
below-cost fuel sales.  Indian Oil rose 1.5 percent to 307.75 rupees at the close
in Mumbai compared with a 1.1 percent increase in the benchmark
Sensitive Index. Bharat Petroleum Corp. gained 2.1 percent and
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. 0.7 percent.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , which operates the world’s
biggest refining complex and fuel outlets in India, gained 3.1
percent to 933.85 rupees. The price of diesel sold by Reliance
isn’t controlled by the government.  Crude oil in New York trading has climbed 10 percent this
year and reached a high of $113.93 a barrel on April 29, hurting
India’s state-run refiners. The July contract on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  was down 47 cents, or 0.5 percent, at
$100.85 a barrel at 10:39 a.m. London time.  Indian state refiners currently lose 4.8 billion rupees a
day selling fuels below cost, according to a  statement  on the
oil ministry’s website. The shortfall is 14.66 rupees a liter on
diesel, 28.28 rupees a liter on kerosene and 329.73 a 14.2-
kilogram bottle on cooking gas, according to the statement.  India’s wholesale price index has stayed above 8 percent
for 16 consecutive months, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The nation plans to narrow the fiscal deficit to 4.6
percent of gross domestic product in the year ending March 31,
from 5.1 percent in the previous 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
