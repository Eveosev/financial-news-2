Telefonica SA (TEF) , Europe’s second-
largest phone company, is seeking to raise about 745 million
euros ($1.1 billion) in an initial public offering of its call-
center division Atento Inversiones y Teleservicios SAU.  Telefonica is selling 33.7 million Atento shares, including
the so-called overallotment option, for a range of 19.25 euros
to 25 euros each, the Madrid-based company said today. At the
middle point, Telefonica will raise 745 million euros.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta, who had
tried to sell Atento as early as in 2007, is seeking to reduce
debt and focus on  Latin America  to offset declining domestic
market share. About 56.1 percent of Atento will be publicly
tradable after the IPO, according to a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Atento’s revenue rose 26 percent last year to 1.66 billion
euros, with the largest part coming from Brazil, according to
Telefonica’a annual report. Operating profit before depreciation
and amortization increased 23 percent to 190 million euros.  Telefonica said yesterday it plans to cut 25 percent of its
Spanish workforce over five years, instead of 20 percent of over
three years under an earlier proposal. The phone company is
betting on Latin America’s economic growth to win back investors
discouraged by Spain’s unemployment rate, the highest in Europe.
While revenue from Latin America rose 26 percent, its profit
margin in the region slipped 0.5 percentage point to 36.2
percent in the first quarter.  The shares fell 0.7 percent to 16.57 euros at the 5:30 p.m.
close of trading in Madrid. They have gained 9.8 percent in the
past 12 months, giving the company a market value of 75.6
billion euros.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are managing
the IPO, along with  Banco Santander SA (SAN) ,  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) ,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA. (BBVA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
