Gold may gain as concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis boosts demand for the metal as a protection
of wealth, a survey found.  Seventeen of 19 traders, investors and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 89 percent, said bullion will rise next week. One
predicted lower prices and one was neutral. Gold for August
delivery was up 0.8 percent for this week at $1,520.40 an ounce
by 10:24 a.m. yesterday on the Comex in  New York . It reached a
record of $1,577.40 on May 2.  European policy makers are seeking ways to restore investor
confidence on increasing concern that  Greece  won’t be able to
repay its debts after last year’s 110 billion euro ($155
billion) bailout. The region’s crisis helped drive gold priced
in euros and British pounds to records this week.  “Euro zone debt concerns are now front and center,” said
 Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG in  London . “Gold
should remain supported in the near term.”  The attached chart tracks the results of the Bloomberg
survey, with the red bars derived by subtracting bearish
forecasts from bullish estimates. Readings below zero signal
that most respondents expect a decline. The green line shows the
gold price. The data are as of May 20.  The weekly gold survey, which started seven years ago, has
forecast prices accurately in 209 of 364 weeks, or 57 percent of
the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 17 Bearish: 1 Neutral: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
