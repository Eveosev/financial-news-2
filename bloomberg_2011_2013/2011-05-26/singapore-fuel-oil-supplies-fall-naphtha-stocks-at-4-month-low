Singapore â€™s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell from the highest in three weeks, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed. Light
distillate supplies dropped to the lowest in four months.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined 3.4
percent to 21.7 million barrels in the seven days to May 25,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Inventories were at 22.5 million barrels last week, the
highest since April 27.  Supplies of light distillates such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline fell 3.9 percent to 9.7 million barrels, the lowest
since Jan. 31. Middle distillates, including gasoil and kerosene,
rose 13 percent to 12 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
