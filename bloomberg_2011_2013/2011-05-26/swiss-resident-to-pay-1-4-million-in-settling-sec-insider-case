Giuseppe Tullio Abatemarco, an
insurance salesman living in Switzerland, will pay $1.4 million
to resolve U.S. regulatory claims that he used nonpublic
information to bet on Royal DSM NV’s 2010 acquisition of  Martek
Biosciences Corp. (MATK)   Abatemarco, 40, bought 2,616  call options  on Martek stock
from Dec. 10 to Dec. 15, then sold them on Dec. 21, the day the
deal was announced, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
in a complaint filed in April. He agreed to surrender $1.2
million in proceeds that were frozen by a  U.S. federal court  on
Dec. 22 and pay a $200,000 penalty, the SEC said in a statement
released today citing the May 24 settlement.  Royal DSM, a Heerlen, Netherlands-based chemical company,
said it would pay $1 billion, or $31.50 a share, for Martek’s
outstanding common stock, a 35 percent premium over the previous
day’s closing price, the SEC said. Abatemarco, who learned of
the planned offer from a colleague who is the common-law wife of
a DSM employee, knew or should have known the information was
material and nonpublic, the agency said.  Abatemarco agreed to settle the SEC’s claims without
admitting or denying wrongdoing. Douglas Tween, his attorney at
Baker & McKenzie LLP in  New York , declined to comment.  Royal DSM completed the acquisition of Columbia, Maryland-
based Martek on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
