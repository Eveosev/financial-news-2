U.S. economic growth is being
restrained by rising crude  oil prices  and the effects of the
earthquake in Japan, said  Ward McCarthy , chief financial
economist at Jefferies & Co. Inc. in New York.  “What we’re seeing in the recent spate of data that has
been on the sluggish side has really been a consequence of some
of the effects of the earthquake and tsunami on Japan
manufacturing, especially the auto sector,” McCarthy said in a
radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom
Keene .  The economy will probably expand at a 2.2 percent annual
rate during the second quarter, McCarthy said. A report today
from the Commerce Department showed the economy grew at a less-
than-forecast 1.8 percent pace during the first quarter.  Gasoline “had a significant effect on  consumer spending ,”
he said. “In an environment in which we have fairly moderate
income growth, consumers just don’t have the wherewithal at this
point in time to be able to handle $4 a gallon gasoline and
continue spending on discretionary items at the same level.”  The national average price for regular gasoline was $3.81
per gallon yesterday, up 38 percent from a year earlier,
according to the American Automobile Association.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
