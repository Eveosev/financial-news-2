Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced on
speculation global funds are adding further to holdings of the
nation’s relatively high-yielding debt. Benchmark bonds rose for
a second day.  Overseas investors boosted holdings of Indonesia’s
 government bonds  by 2.5 percent to 226.89 trillion rupiah ($26.4
billion) this month through May 24, according to data from the
debt management office. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional
shares, which dropped yesterday on concern Europe’s sovereign-
debt crisis will deepen, rose the most in five weeks week after
oil and copper prices jumped May 25.  “Foreign flows into the bond market are supporting the
rupiah,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , a Singapore-based economist at
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. “The recovery in the rupiah and
regional currencies is temporary, in reaction to the higher
commodity prices. In the medium term, there’s still concern
about the  Europe  debt crisis.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.2 percent to 8,583 per dollar as
of 4:29 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has gained 4.6 percent this year, the second-best
performance among Asia’s 10 most-traded currencies.  Ten-year government bonds advanced. The yield on the 8.25
percent bond due July 2021 fell four basis points or 0.04
percentage point, to 7.43 percent, according to closing prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
