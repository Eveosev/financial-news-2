Cocoa supplies will outpace demand by
189,000 metric tons in the current marketing season as
production rises in  Africa , according to the  International Cocoa
Organization .  Output will jump 52 percent to 960,000 tons in the 2010-11
season in Ghana, the world’s second-biggest cocoa grower, ICCO
Executive Director Jean-Marc Anga said in an interview in  London 
today. Production in top producer Ivory Coast will increase 4.7
percent to 1.3 million tons, he said. The estimated surplus is
70,000 tons larger than projected in February.  “We had two big factors to take into account,” Anga said.
“One is the excellent weather conditions that were conducive to
higher output, and secondly, the high prices have been a good
incentive for farmers to implement better husbandry of cocoa
plantation.”  Cocoa prices reached a 32-year high of $3,775 a ton on
March 4 after  Ivory Coast  exports were disrupted by armed
conflict between backers of President  Alassane Ouattara  and
those of former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who refused to cede power
after a disputed election in November. Ouattara has since taken
office and lifted a ban on cocoa exports.  Cameroon,  Indonesia   Output in  Nigeria  will increase by 5,000 tons to 240,000
tons, and production in Cameroon is estimated at 215,000 tons, a
10,000-ton jump, Anga said. The biggest decline will come from
Indonesia, the third-largest producer, where output will fall to
510,000 tons from 550,000 tons, according to the ICCO.  The gain in Ghana will bring its production closer to that
of Ivory Coast, which now accounts for 35 percent of world
supply, according to the ICCO. The group plans to release its
crop estimates next week.  “Once this is released, people in Ivory Coast will stand
up and pay attention, Anga said. “We have been telling them for
the past years that they have neglected investments in the cocoa
sector.”  Ghana  is still unlikely to surpass Ivory Coast anytime
soon, according to Anga. “It takes a lot more than a year or
two,” he said.  Anga also said the new Ivorian government must have a
“well-defined” strategy to invest in the industry. “The
government will have to decide that in the next 5 or 10 years it
wants to remain the leading producer,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
