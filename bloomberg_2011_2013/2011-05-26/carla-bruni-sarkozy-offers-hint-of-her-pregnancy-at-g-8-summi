France’s first lady, Carla Bruni- Sarkozy, showed off her rounded belly at the Group of Eight
summit, offering a coy confirmation of her pregnancy.  The 43-year-old wife of President  Nicolas Sarkozy , dressed
in a white Chanel dress with a dark-blue jacket, pointed to her
midsection as she posed for photographs with the wives of the
leaders arriving for the two-day gathering in Deauville, France.  The former fashion model’s pregnancy was announced by her
father-law in a May 17 interview with the German newspaper Bild.
Aides to the 56-year-old president have said there would be no
official comment on or confirmation of the matter.  “You are doing your job in asking, and I’m doing my job in
not responding,” she said in a May 11 interview with Paris-
based RTL Radio. “I try to protect my private life as best I
can. I think people understand.”  The baby would be the first born to a French incumbent head
of state since Empress Eugenie gave birth to Louis-Napoleon
Bonaparte at the Palais des Tuileries in Paris 155 years ago.
The baby is due in the autumn, before the May 2012 presidential
election. Sarkozy has yet to say if he will seek a second term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
