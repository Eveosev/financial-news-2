A consumer price report today will
probably show the first inflation in 28 months after the March
earthquake caused a rise in energy and food prices. Sony’s
profit forecast after the close yesterday fell short of analyst
estimates. Honda said a rebound in parts supplies will bring
North American production back to normal, with the exception of
its Civic model.  WHAT TO WATCH
