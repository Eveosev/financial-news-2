Saudi Arabia ’s 5 billion-riyal ($1.3
billion) loan to Emaar Economic City will fund the company’s
Brussels-sized housing and business development near  Jeddah 
through 2012, Deutsche Bank AG said.  The loan, secured against 24.7 million square meters of
land, or 15 percent of Emaar Economic City’s holdings, “should
boost development activity in the city, after significantly
slowing down in 2010,” analysts Athmane Benzerroug and Nabil Ahmed wrote in a note to investors today.  King Abdullah Economic City, part of a $400 billion plan
investment plan announced by the government in 2008, is designed
to house about 2 million people and generate 1 million jobs.
Emaar Economic City is jointly owned by the Saudi state and
 Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , Dubai’s biggest property developer.  Government’s support for the project is crucial for its
survival as high infrastructure costs and slow home sales
reduced the developer’s cash to 339 million riyals in 2010 from
2.2 billion riyals in 2008, the analysts wrote. The size of the
loan “exactly matches with our estimate” of Emaar Economic
City’s need for capital and operating funds in 2011-2012, the
analysts wrote.  The 10-year loan will be used to “accelerate the
development and construction of the second phase of King
Abdullah Economic City,” Jeddah-based Emaar Economic City said
in a statement yesterday. Repayment will start after three
years.  The analysts maintained their “hold” rating on the shares
because the developer trades in line with other Saudi builders
and the project is still in the design phase.  Saudi Arabia’s stock market is closed today for the
weekend. Announcement of the loan came after the end of trading
yesterday. Emaar Economic City shares closed 1.3 percent lower
at 7.4 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
