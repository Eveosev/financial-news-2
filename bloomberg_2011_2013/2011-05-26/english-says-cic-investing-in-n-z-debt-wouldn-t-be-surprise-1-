New Zealand  Finance Minister Bill English said investments in his government’s bonds by China’s
sovereign wealth fund wouldn’t be surprising after a report the
Beijing-based company may buy some of the island nation’s debt.  “I wouldn’t be surprised if they allocate a tiny slip of
it to New Zealand and a slightly larger slip of it to
 Australia ,” English said at an event in  Hong Kong  today.  Asian nations are seeking to diversify record foreign-
exchange holdings as the U.S. dollar’s decline threatens to
erode returns. China Investment Corp., a $300 billion fund, may
have set aside 1.5 percent, or about NZ$6 billion ($4.9
billion), of its reserves to invest in New Zealand,
interest.co.nz reported earlier today, citing an unidentified
person.  Chinese investors “realize if they don’t want political
opposition to their investments, which is easily inflamed in
most of the developed world, they need to tread pretty
carefully,” he said.  China ’s sovereign fund may have allocated 2 percent of its
reserves for Australian assets, the Auckland-based website
reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
