Leaders from the Group of Eight
countries will call for an end to violence in Syria and  Libya  to
be followed by political negotiations,  Agence France-Presse 
reported, citing a draft of their final statement.  The two-day summit that began today Deauville, France, will
also call for a resumption of peace talks between Israelis and
Palestinians, AFP said.  The draft calls on the Syrian regime to stop using force
against protesters and to “engage in dialogue as well as carry
out fundamental reforms.” In Libya, it calls for a “political
solution that respects the will of the people.”  It asks Israeli and Palestinian leaders to start
“substantive discussions without delay with the aim of
concluding a framework accord on questions linked to the final
status.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
