An independent committee of
environmentalists appointed by the U.K. government to look into
the future of publicly owned forests could recommend that the
state purchase more woodland, according to the Bishop of
Liverpool,  James Jones , who is chairman of the panel, the
London-based Times reported.  In an interview with the newspaper, the bishop said there
are “no holds barred” in the committee’s remit, set out in a
letter from Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman.  The terms of reference would allow a recommendation to
enlarge the amount of woodland, and “we would have to decide
how we did that, through the private sector or the public
estate,” the bishop told the Times.  Earlier this year, a public outcry, including a petition
signed by more than half a million people, led the government to
abandon plans to dispose of the entire public woodland estate.  The bishop said there’s “something almost spiritual in
people’s connection with forests” and the government had failed
to understand that, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
