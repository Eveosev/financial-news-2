China ’s yuan strengthened to a 17-
year high as the central bank set the currency’s reference rate
at the strongest level in nearly six years.  The People’s Bank of China set the rate 0.04 percent
stronger at 6.4921 per dollar, the highest level since July
2005. China’s inflation may accelerate to 6 percent, according
to  George Magnus , a senior economic adviser at UBS AG in London.
Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April, above the
government’s target of a maximum of 4 percent this year.  “The fixing is back to its appreciation path to reflect
the domestic inflation concern,” said Edmond Law, deputy head
of foreign exchange at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “We
may see further tightening in China and that makes the yuan spot
stronger.”  The yuan advanced 0.03 percent to 6.4915 per dollar as of
the close at 4:30 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.4858
earlier, the strongest level since 1993. The yuan isn’t allowed
to move more than 0.5 percent either side of the central bank’s
daily fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan gained
0.1 percent to 6.4910.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.13
percent to 6.3775 per dollar as of 4:34 p.m. in Hong Kong,
reflecting a 1.8 percent premium over the spot rate in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The fair value of the yuan, which is “significantly
undervalued” against the dollar, may be between 3.5 and 6
versus the dollar, Magnus said at the Bloomberg China Conference
in  London  yesterday. There is “virtually no chance” of a one-
off appreciation in the currency, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
