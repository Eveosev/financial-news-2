Twitter Inc. said it will notify
users if the micro-blogging service receives requests to
disclose personal data and it protects their right to a legal
defense.  “To the extent we can, we give users notice of requests so
they have opportunity to defend themselves,” Twitter U.K.
General Manager Tony Wang said  yesterday  in a post on his
Twitter account.  The San-Francisco-based company requires a court order, or
other valid legal process to disclose information about users,
according to its  website . Twitter will only respond to requests
in compliance with U.S. law, it says.  The micro-blogging service was sued in  London  by a football
player who won an anonymity order banning the media from
publishing stories about his alleged affair with a reality-
television star. A Twitter user on May 8 had posted a series of
messages claiming a number of U.K. celebrities had won so-called
super-injunctions.  “Our policy is to notify users and we have fought to
ensure user rights,” Twitter General Counsel Alexander Macgillivray said in a separate Twitter post.  British lawmakers have cited legislative “privilege”
during open sessions of Parliament to disclose the names of
celebrities who won injunctions. Liberal Democrat John Hemming
said any Twitter user in the U.K. who is notified of a request
for information could organize a collective defense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
