Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures declined from a two-week high in  New York 
following a report that the  U.S. economy  grew less than forecast
in the first quarter.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30 percent as of 4 p.m. in New York, down
from 32.4 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for July delivery dropped $1.09, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $100.23 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the first decline in three days. Prices have climbed
40 percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
July $95 puts, with 2,977 lots changing hands. They lost 6 cents
to $1.07 a barrel. July $90 puts, the next-most active option,
dropped 7 cents to 42 cents a barrel with 2,191 lots trading.
One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  July $85 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 4,120 lots changing hands. They slipped 6 cents
to 23 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, December $80
puts, dropped 17 cents to $2.08 a barrel on volume of 3,878
lots.  Open interest was highest for December 2012 $80 puts with
46,222 contracts. Next were December 2011 $120 calls with 43,262
