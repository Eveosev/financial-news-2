Food and drug manufacturers’
inspection records and citations for misleading advertising will
be  disclosed  by U.S. regulators as part of the Obama
administration’s efforts to improve transparency in government.  The  Food and Drug Administration  released a  database  today
of inspections conducted from Oct. 1, 2008, to Sept. 30, 2010,
and plans to update the list each fiscal year, according to
Tamara Ward, an agency spokeswoman. The FDA will also start
sharing more  letters  warning companies of illegal product
promotions within the next six to nine months, she said.  The initiatives are among 21 steps proposed last year to
expand the public’s knowledge of regulation of medical products.
Other steps, including a plan to disclose drug rejections that
industry has criticized, are under consideration and the FDA
expects to have more information by the end of 2011, Ward said.  The new database includes the name and address of the
company being inspected, the purpose of the visit, the date the
review ended and whether the findings prompted additional
actions or referral to state or FDA officials. A Bloomberg
analysis found that more than half of the drug-manufacturing
plants in the U.S. were cited for violations during inspections
last year, a 20 percent increase since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
