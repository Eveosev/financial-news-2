Investors from  Asia  and the Middle
East bought 23 percent of the 4.75 billion euros ($6.7 billion)
of five-year notes sold yesterday to help fund Portugalâ€™s
bailout, the European Commission said.  Investors from Asia acquired 16 percent of the securities,
which pay a coupon of 2.75 percent and were priced at the
benchmark swap rate, the commission said in a statement on its
 website . Central banks and other official institutions bought 36
percent of the debt, it said. The EU received bids for 10
billion euros, it said.  The sale was the second in two days enabling the European
Financial Stabilization Mechanism rescue fund to complete its
announced transactions for the second quarter, the commission
said. Following the sales, disbursements to Ireland and  Portugal 
will be made next week, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
