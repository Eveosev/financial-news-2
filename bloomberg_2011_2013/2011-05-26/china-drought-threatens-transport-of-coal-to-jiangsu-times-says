China ’s driest weather in decades is
threatening river transport of power-station coal to eastern
Jiangsu province,  Beijing Times  said, without citing anyone.  The drought has started to affect shipments on the Yangtze
and Huai rivers, the newspaper reported. Some areas in Jiangsu
are facing the worst dry spell in 60 years, it said, citing Song
Yu, a vice director at the provincial water resources office.  The nationwide drought has cut hydropower output and
intensified an electricity shortage in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy that relies on coal as fuel at more than
70 percent of its  power plants . Boats delivered about 17 million
metric tons of coal on the Yangtze in 2007, said  David Fang ,
director of international cooperation at the China Coal
Transport and Distribution Association.  “This will worsen the electricity shortage as coal
supplies will be hampered, but given the relatively small
shipment volumes on the two rivers, the impact will be
limited,” Fang said by telephone from Beijing today. China
produced 3.24 billion tons of coal last year.  --Winnie Zhu, Huang Zhe. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
