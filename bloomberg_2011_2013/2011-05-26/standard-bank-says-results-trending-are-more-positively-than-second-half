Standard Bank  Group Ltd., Africa’s
biggest lender, said results from the four months through April
showed an improvement from the second half of last year as
customers repaid loans.  While earnings excluding one-time items and accounting
charges in the first four months were “slightly lower” than
the same period a year earlier, results are “trending more
positively than the second half of 2010,” the Johannesburg-
based lender said in a statement today.  Impairments decreased at Standard Bank’s personal and
business banking unit while the credit quality of corporate and
investment banking clients continued to get better, Standard
Bank said. The lower bad debt charge and a rise in fees from
transactions helped compensate for s decline in revenue from
interest charges and a drop in trading income, it said.  The environment in which Standard Bank operates still
remains “relatively subdued,” the lender said. Standard Bank’s
shares have declined 7.8 percent this year, the worst performer
in the six-member FTSE/JSE  Africa  Banks Index, which has
declined 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
