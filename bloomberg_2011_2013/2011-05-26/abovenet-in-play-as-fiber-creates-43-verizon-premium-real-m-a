There may never be a better time for
 AboveNet Inc. (ABVT)  to put itself up for sale.  The owner of optical fiber networks that  hedge funds ,
exchanges and social media companies use to send data in cities
rose to a record this week on speculation it is looking for
buyers. With the most profitable business among its biggest
rivals and less debt,  White Plains , New York-based AboveNet may
command a premium of almost 30 percent to fiber deals struck at
9.3 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization last year, according to Dougherty & Co.  AboveNet, which exited bankruptcy in 2003, is profiting as
a projected tripling of Internet traffic strains networks and
prompts businesses to seek faster connections. With more cash
than debt and cash flows that more than doubled in the past
three years, AboveNet may attract interest from private equity
firms, Cowen & Co. said.  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  and  AT&T
Inc. (T)  could also be buyers, according to Dougherty’s Mark Kelleher, who says it may be worth $100 a share in a takeover.
That’s 43 percent more than AboveNet’s price yesterday.  “Whoever is going to buy AboveNet would have to write a
very big check,” said Colby Synesael, a New York-based analyst
at Cowen, who has an “outperform” rating on AboveNet. “In
terms of public companies, I think AboveNet makes the most sense
because they’re a pure play and an infrastructure provider.”  Jeffrey Garte, a spokesman at AboveNet, said the company
doesn’t comment on market rumors or speculation.  Peter Thonis , a
spokesman for Verizon, declined to comment, as did Mike Buckley
for Dallas-based AT&T.  Relative Value  AboveNet, led by Chief Executive Officer William LaPerch,
generated a 71 percent return for the company’s owners in the
past year through yesterday, which included a $5 per-share
dividend in December. That outstripped the 48 percent gain for
technology stocks in the Russell 2000 Index, including payouts.  The company owns fiber networks in more than a dozen of the
biggest U.S. cities, including New York,  Washington  and  San
Francisco , according to AboveNet’s  website . Revenue has climbed
86 percent over the past five years, driven in part by more
businesses using remote data centers to run their software and
store their data.  Worldwide demand for so-called cloud-computing services may
more than double to $148.8 billion in 2014 from $58.6 billion in
2009, according to  Stamford , Connecticut-based Gartner Inc.
AboveNet connects companies to data centers using its network of
 optical fiber , which is made from bundles of flexible glass that
can transmit more data over longer distances than metal wires.  Fiber Highway  AboveNet’s conduits typically contain about 432 fibers,
about three times the market average, according to Cowen’s
Synesael. The company’s shares jumped 9.3 percent on May 24
after DealReporter said it hired New York-based JPMorgan Chase &
Co. to find a buyer. AboveNet rose 1.1 percent to $70.07
yesterday, giving it a market value of $1.81 billion.  Today, the stock climbed 5.6 percent to $73.97.  With $15.6 million more in cash than debt, AboveNet is
valued at about 8.6 times its estimated Ebitda of $209 million,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. For fiber deals in 2010, buyers
paid an average of 9.3 times Ebitda, according to Cowen.  In an acquisition, AboveNet may be able to ask for as much
as 12 times next year’s Ebitda, according to Kelleher, a Boston-
based analyst at Dougherty. That’s equal about $100 a share,
according to his estimates.  “You’ve got this movement right now to cloud computing,”
said Kelleher, who recommends buying shares of AboveNet. “All
of this information is being moved out to these data centers.
Fiber is the highway. It’s how you get data in and out.”  Profitability  A deal for AboveNet would then cost more than the 6.4 times
Ebitda that Broomfield, Colorado-based  Level 3 Communications
Inc. (LVLT)  agreed to pay for  Global Crossing Ltd. (GLBC)  in an all-stock deal
last month. Both compete with AboveNet.  While AboveNet has made money in the past five years, Level
3 lost $622 million last year and hasn’t been profitable since
1998. Global Crossing, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , and run out
of  Florham Park ,  New Jersey , lost $172 million in 2010 and last
had a profit in 2003, the year it emerged from bankruptcy.  The two companies are also burdened with more debt than
AboveNet. Level 3 and Global Crossing had a total of $7.2
billion in net debt as of March, while Washington-based  Cogent
Communications Group Inc. (CCOI) , another rival, had $151 million more
in borrowings than cash, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  AboveNet generated 25 cents in operating income for each
dollar of revenue in the past 12 months, the highest of the four
fiber companies and more than three times the operating margin
of Cogent, the data show.  Potential Bidders  Cash from operations at AboveNet has also increased by 134
percent in the past three years, more than double the rate of
Cogent. Level 3 and Global Crossing both reported declines in
operating cash last year, the data show.  AboveNet is a “very attractive asset from a balance-sheet
perspective,” said Robert Dezego, an Atlanta-based analyst with
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. “You’re not buying a declining-
revenue asset. You’re buying a growing-revenue asset. They have
a good infrastructure. It’s a well-run company.”  Dezego, who rates AboveNet a “buy,” estimates the company
may be valued as high as $88 a share in a takeover.  Its ability to generate cash and profits makes it a target
for private equity firms, according to Cowen’s Synesael.  “Quite frankly, fiber is a great place for PEs to put
money,” he said. “It’s a low-risk business with recurring
revenues and high margins.”  Deal Rationale  Dougherty’s Kelleher favors Verizon as the most likely
buyer after the New York-based wireless carrier acquired
 Terremark Worldwide Inc. (TMRK) , a cloud computing provider, for $1.7
billion including net debt last month.  AboveNet already connects Terremark’s Culpeper, Virginia-
based data centers with Washington, which could help Verizon
compete better in the area. AboveNet is also expanding its fiber
network in Miami, where Terremark is based.  “AboveNet has very high density of fiber within the cities
they focus on, and those cities tend to be where the big data
centers are,” Kelleher said. “If Verizon asked Terremark where
to go for metro fiber, Terremark would point to AboveNet.”  Overall, there have been 9,985 deals announced globally
this year, totaling $967.8 billion, a 21 percent increase from
the $797.6 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
