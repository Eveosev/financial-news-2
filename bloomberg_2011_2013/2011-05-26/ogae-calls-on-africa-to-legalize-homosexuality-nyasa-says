Festus Mogae, Botswana’s former
president and chairman of Champions for an HIV Free Generation,
said the criminalization of homosexuality and sex work in Malawi
and other African countries is inhibiting the fight against
HIV/AIDS,  Nyasa Times  reported.  Sexual orientation should not be a basis for arrest or
detention, Mogae said during a visit to Malawi, accompanied by
Zambia’s ex-president, Kenneth Kaunda, the online newspaper
said.  Mogae called on African governments to distribute condoms
in prisons, which he said are breeding grounds for HIV
infections, according to the Nyasa Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
