Lebanon’s economy may grow as much as
5 percent if political uncertainty that has marred the country
since the collapse of the government of  Saad Hariri  in January
subsides, the  central bank  governor said.  “We think we can go to around 5 percent, fuelled
essentially by consumption, delayed investments that would
materialize and the construction sector picking up,” Governor
Riad Salameh said in an interview in Beirut today.  The economy is forecast to slow to about 2.5 percent this
year, from an average of 8 percent in the past four years, the
 International Monetary Fund  said in an April report. Lebanon’s
economic growth will accelerate to 4 percent next year,
according to a draft budget distributed by the  Finance Ministry 
earlier this month.  If political uncertainty persists growth will be zero to
2.5 percent, Salameh said.  Billionaire businessman Najib Mikati, who became prime
minister-designate after the January collapse of Saad Hariri’s
coalition, has yet to form a government because of stalled talks
over Cabinet portfolios. Mikati won the backing of lawmakers to
lead the nation after the previous government fell amid a
dispute with the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah movement over a United
Nations inquiry into the killing of former Prime Minister  Rafiq Hariri , Saad’s father.  To contact the reporter on this story:
