 MGM China Holdings Ltd. is expected
to sell shares in an initial public offering in  Hong Kong  at
HK$15.34 each, the top end of a range marketed to investors, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The Macau casino operator is due to sign off on the final
pricing today after banks arranging the sale recommended it,
said the people, who declined to be identified before an
announcement. MGM China originally offered 760 million shares at
HK$12.36 to HK$15.34 apiece, according to the prospectus for the
sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
