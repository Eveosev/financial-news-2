The International Monetary Fund needs
“financing assurances” before disbursing money to Greece and
other countries seeking assistance,  Caroline Atkinson , an IMF
spokeswoman, told a news conference in  Washington  today.  “We have to ask for financing assurances in every
program,” Atkinson said, adding that the money is to help close
financing gaps.  The spokeswoman said: “It’s important at the IMF that we
put our money in when we have worked with a country to take
steps to close the gap and when we’re seeing that other
financing is available. That is how we maintain the safety of
our members’ money.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
