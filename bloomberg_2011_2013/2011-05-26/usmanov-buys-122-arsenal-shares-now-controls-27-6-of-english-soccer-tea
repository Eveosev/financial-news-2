Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov
bought 122 more shares of Arsenal Holding Plc for 14,000 pounds
($22,900) each, taking his stake in the London soccer club to
27.6 percent.  Usmanov, using his Red and White Holdings Ltd., is vying
for influence at the 13-time English champion with Stan Kroenke.
The American has an almost 64 percent stake in Arsenal, which
finished fourth in the just finished season. Kroenke made an
offer of 11,750 pounds last month for shares after buying 30
percent from two former directors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
