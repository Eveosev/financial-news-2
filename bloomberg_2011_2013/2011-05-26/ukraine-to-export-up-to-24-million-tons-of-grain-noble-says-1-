Ukraine will export as much as 24
million metric tons of grain in the coming marketing year,
according to the local unit of commodities supplier Noble Group
Ltd.  Shipments will come to at least 22 million tons in the year
starting July 1, Ivan Myroshnychenko, director of Noble
Resources Ukraine, said today at the Grain and Feed Trade
Association’s 4th International Grain Conference in Kiev.
Ukraine’s wheat harvest may reach 20 million tons if weather is
favorable, of which 11.5 million to 12 million tons would be
exportable, he said.  The country’s barley crop probably will be 8 million to 8.5
million tons, with exports of 3 million to 3.5 million tons
assuming favorable weather and free shipments, according to
Noble. Corn production “has prospects” to reach as much as 14
million tons, with potential exports of 7 million tons,
Myroshnychenko said.  China Investment Corp., the Asian nation’s sovereign wealth
fund, owns a stake of about 15 percent in Hong Kong-based Noble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
