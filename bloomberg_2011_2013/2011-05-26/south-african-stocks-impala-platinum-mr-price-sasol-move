The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
rose for a third day, adding 186.52, or 0.6 percent, to
31,980.11 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s biggest gold
producer, declined the most since May 4, falling 5.70 rand, or
1.8 percent, to 309.10 rand. Gold slipped the most in more than
a week in  New York , losing as much as 0.8 percent to $1,514.82
an ounce as the euro strengthened after speculation that China
will increase its purchases of European bonds, easing concern
that the region’s debt crisis will spread and eroding the appeal
of the precious metal as an alternative currency.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , the continent’s second-biggest
producer of the metal, declined 1.06 rand, or 1 percent, to
110.96 rand. Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (HAR SJ), the third-
largest supplier, dropped the most since May 4, slumping 2.90
rand, or 3.1 percent, to 91.01 rand.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
biggest producer of the metal, snapped two day of gains, losing
2.84 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 183.21 rand. Platinum retreated
for the first day in three.  Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC)  , a clothing and furniture
retailer, rose 64 cents, or 1 percent, to 63.90 rand, erasing
yesterday’s decline. Operating profit advanced 45 percent in the
year through April, it said in a regulatory filing.  Standard Bank  Group Ltd. (SBK SJ), Africa’s biggest bank,
advanced 1.30 rand, or 1.3 percent, to 100.50 rand, the highest
since May 10. The company expects improving retail debt
conditions to continue through the year, unless there were to be
“a massive rise in  interest rates ,” Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Sim Tshabalala said in an interview in Johannesburg.  Trustco Group Holdings Ltd. (TTO)  , a property
development and financial services group, closed at the highest
level since May 9, rising 2 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 1.07 rand.
Income for the year ended March increased 38 percent to 189.8
million Namibian dollars ($27 million), the company said in an
earnings statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
