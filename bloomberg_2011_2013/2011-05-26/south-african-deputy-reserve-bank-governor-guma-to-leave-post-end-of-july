South African  Reserve Bank  Deputy
Governor Xolile Guma will leave his post after declining to
renew his contract that ends on July 31, the central bank said.  Guma, who has been at the bank for 16 years, will serve a
three-month cooling-off period that prohibits taking a paid job
until the end of October, the Pretoria-based bank said in a
statement on its website today.  Guma’s exit comes two months after President  Jacob Zuma 
named Lesetja Kganyago, former director-general of the National
Treasury, as a deputy governor. Guma, 54, was the only member of
the Monetary Policy Committee absent from an open meeting at the
central bank’s head office on May 24, when Kganyago made his
first public appearance in his new position.  “Guma was seen as a potential Reserve Bank governor,”
said Azar Jammine, chief economist of Econometrix in
Johannesburg. “We have Lesetja being appointed and it’s
possible he is being groomed for that position.”  The Reserve Bank said Zuma will decide “in due course” on
Guma’s successor. The deputy governor is in charge of the
departments of corporate services, research and currency and
protection, according to the bank’s website.  Guma’s departure reduces the MPC to seven members. Rashad Cassim, head of the bank’s research department, joined the
committee in March from Statistics South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
