Spain  is seeking to extend guarantees
on about 80 billion euros ($113 billion) of bank bonds beyond
the end of June to help lenders’ access to funding.  The government asked the European Commission for an
additional six months for the backing first made during the
credit crisis in 2008, according to a Madrid-based official at
the Spanish Treasury, who declined to be identified because of
ministry policy.  Spanish lenders are under pressure as the deficit crisis
that triggered bailouts of  Greece ,  Portugal  and Ireland makes
investors wary of bank debt. Bondholders want 189 basis points
in extra yield to buy a five-year Spanish covered bond, the most
popular type of debt issued by the country’s banks, instead of a
note issued by a German lender. The difference was 143 basis
points in April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Clearly, this move signals that the overall funding
conditions for some Spanish banks remain challenging and that
for some issuers capital market access is limited,” said Leef Dierks, a London-based analyst at Morgan Stanley.  The nation’s largest lenders,  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, haven’t sold government guaranteed
bonds after raising the equivalent to $91 billion by selling
debt including covered bonds and unsecured debt since January
2010, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
