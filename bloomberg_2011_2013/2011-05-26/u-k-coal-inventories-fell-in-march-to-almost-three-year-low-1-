U.K. coal  inventories  held by power
companies fell in March to the lowest in almost three years
after stocks were run down last year on weakening demand.  Inventories were 9.6 million metric tons, the lowest since
April 2008, compared with 11 million tons in February, according
to figures from the Department of Energy &  Climate Change . They
rose as high as 22.9 million tons in September 2009, the most
for government data going back to 1995. Demand for coal weakened
over the prior 12 months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
collapsed, triggering recession in  Europe , the U.S. and  Japan 
and cutting demand for coal and power.  Prices also encouraged buying, with coal delivered to
northwestern Europe averaging $70.39 a ton in 2009, according to
IHS McCloskey, a researcher based in Petersfield,  England . That
compares with a $147.95 average in 2008 and $91.69 average last
year, when global demand and prices were driven by China and
 India , the world’s most populous nations.  “Clearly in 2009 prices were very cheap and, with coal, a
lot of these are contracts and you can’t necessarily renege on
them,” so that swelled inventories, Amrita Sen, an analyst with
 Barclays Capital  in London, said by phone today. Then “demand
fell quickly and sharply and in 2010 they ran down
inventories.”  Generators will have to re-stock in 2011, and the U.K. will
import 18.5 million tons of coal for power this year compared
with 17 million tons in 2010, Sen forecast.  Dark Spreads  Coal was  burned  to meet 28.5 percent of the U.K.’s
electricity needs in 2010, compared with 47.5 percent from gas
and 15.5 percent from nuclear generation, according to the
government.  Dark spreads, a measure of profitability for burning coal
in the U.K., have jumped 150 percent in the last year, according
to Bloomberg calculations. Next-month dark spreads were at 7.42
pounds ($12.10) a megawatt-hour as of 11:40 a.m. in  London .
Higher profits at coal plants can encourage more coal
burn. The dark spreads don’t include costs for emissions
permits.  Coal generation became more favorable for electricity as
natural gas prices rose following the conflict in  Libya  and
Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami and subsequent crisis at
the Fukushima nuclear plant, while some utilites may be running
down stockpiles to improve cash flows, according to Evolution
Securities.  “Coal generators will be looking to maximise cashflow
through better management of working capital,”  Lakis Athanasiou , a London-based Evolution Securities analyst, said by
e-mail. “Another element could be the switch from coal to gas
as the price-setting fuel following Fukushima and Libya.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
