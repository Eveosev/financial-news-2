A Foxconn Technology Group worker in
China’s Chengdu city committed suicide by jumping off a building
this morning,  Hong Kong China News Agency  reported today, citing
a person it didn’t identify.  Edmund Ding and Louis Woo, spokesmen for the Taipei-based
company, didn’t answer calls to their mobile phones. The worker
was a 20 year old male, according to the report.  Foxconn, which employs more than one million workers in
China, makes  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones,  Sony Corp. (6758)  games consoles and
 Dell Inc. (DELL)  computers. At least 12 Foxconn workers committed
suicide last year, prompting the company to install safety nets
on buildings, raise pay and hire counselors.  Chengdu, the capital of southwestern Sichuan Province, is
the location of one of Foxconn’s newest factories. An explosion
May 20 at a company facility in Chengdu that makes iPads killed
three people and injured at least 15 more, with the accident
still under investigation, according to the company.  China had a suicide rate of 94.7 per 100,000 for the 15 to
59 age group in 2008, according to the most recent  estimates 
available from the  World Health Organization .  Most of the suicides at Foxconn last year were prompted by
personal issues and not related to the company or work, Chairman
Terry Gou said in June. Labor groups, including China Labor
Watch, have labeled the company a sweatshop, a claim Gou and
Apple Chief Executive Officer  Steve Jobs  have denied.  To contact the reporter on this story:
