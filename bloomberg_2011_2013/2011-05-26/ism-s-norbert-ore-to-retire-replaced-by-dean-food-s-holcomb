Norbert Ore, chairman of the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory survey committee, will
retire after working for the Tempe, Arizona-based group for more
than 15 years, the organization said today in a statement.  Ore, who retired as director of purchasing for Georgia-
Pacific Corp. in Atlanta in March 2010, is a supply-chain
consultant.  Bradley Holcomb, senior vice president and chief
procurement officer of  Dean Foods Co ., the largest U.S. milk
processor, will replace Ore starting June 1, according to the
release.  The ISM manufacturing index, released monthly, surveys
approximately 350 supply management professionals to gauge the
performance of factories in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
