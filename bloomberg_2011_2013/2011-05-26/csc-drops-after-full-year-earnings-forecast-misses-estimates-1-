Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , the provider
of computer services to companies and U.S. government agencies,
fell as much as 11 percent in New York trading after its fiscal
full-year forecast missed analysts’ estimates.  Full-year profit for fiscal 2012 will be $4.70 to $4.80 a
share, the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company said yesterday
in a statement. Analysts projected $5.07, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Computer Sciences has been hurt by delays in federal
contract decisions and is also working to revise its contract
with the U.K.’s  National Health Service . The company said it
will delay filing its 10-K as a board committee conducts an
independent investigation of accounting practices that are the
subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe. CSC
disclosed the SEC investigation in February.  The company was downgraded today by Barclays Capital
analyst Darrin Peller, who cut his rating to “equalweight”
from “overweight.”  Computer Sciences declined $4.76, or 11 percent, to $39.33
at 9:43 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading for
the steepest drop in three weeks. The shares had fallen 11
percent this year before today.  Full-year revenue will be $16.5 billion to $17 billion, the
company said. That tops analysts’ average estimate of $16.4
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
