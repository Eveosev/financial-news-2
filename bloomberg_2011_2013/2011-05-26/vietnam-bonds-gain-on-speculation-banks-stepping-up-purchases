Vietnam ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation banks are buying more dong-denominated debt after
credit restrictions and interest-rate increases reduced
commercial lending. The dong gained.  The Southeast Asian nation cut its credit-growth target to
less than 20 percent this year, from 23 percent, and tightened
monetary policy to restrain price gains and stabilize the dong.
Vietnam’s central bank has raised at least one of its key
 interest rates  each month this year to damp inflation, which
accelerated to 19.8 percent in May from a year earlier.  “Banks cannot lend right now because of credit squeezing
and very high interest rates,” said Nguyen Tan Thang, head of
fixed-income research at  Ho Chi Minh City  Securities Corp. Banks
are choosing to buy bonds instead, he said.  Two-year bond yields fell 20 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 12.67 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong strengthened 0.5
percent to 20,625 per dollar as of 5:19 p.m. in Hanoi, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,658 today,
compared with 20,663 yesterday, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  -- Nicholas Heath . With assistance from Jason Folkmanis in Ho Chi
