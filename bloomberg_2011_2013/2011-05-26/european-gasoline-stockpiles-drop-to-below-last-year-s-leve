Gasoline stockpiles in northwest
 Europe  fell to the lowest level this year amid expectations of
increased summer demand, according to PJK International BV, an
industry consultant. Inventories are down from a year earlier.  Motor fuel inventories in independent storage dropped
71,000 tons to 585,000 tons in the week to today, according to
PJK. That’s 32 percent less than last year’s level in the
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area, Europe’s hub for oil
deliveries and storage.  “The gasoline drop comes ahead of driving season,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said from Oosterhout, the Netherlands,
where the company is based. The so-called U.S. driving season,
when demand usually peaks, begins on Memorial Day weekend at the
end of this month. Europe ships gasoline to the U.S.  Jet fuel inventories, already at the lowest level in 31
months last week, dropped for a third week amid expectations of
increased demand this summer. Aviation fuel stockpiles declined
19,000 tons to 472,000 tons, PJK said.  Demand for diesel helped reduce inventories in the gasoil
category, which includes both fuels, PJK said. Gasoil, the
European equivalent of heating oil, and diesel are similar
fuels. Inventories in gasoil are up 13 percent from a year
earlier.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
thousands of tons for gasoline, naphtha,  fuel oil  and jet fuel
in independent storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
