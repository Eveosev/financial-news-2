Guinea-Bissau will be completely free
of land mines by the end of next year, a former U.S. ambassador
to the country and head of its largest mine-removal agency said.  The disarming of several thousand land mines left buried in
the Maryland-sized country could make Guinea-Bissau the first
African nation to rid itself of mines, John Blacken, the founder
of Humaid, said in an interview on May 20.  “Every time you take a land mine out of the ground, that’s
a threat gone,” said Blacken, who was U.S. ambassador to the
West African nation from 1986 to 1989. “It’s someone’s life.”  Many of the mines in Guinea-Bissau date back to the war of
independence from  Portugal  between 1963 and 1974 and a civil war
in 1998 and 1999. The country has a population of 1.6 million.  Worldwide, more than 24,000 people a year, most of them
civilians, are killed or maimed by land mines, according to the
 United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
