Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd.,  China ’s second-largest electronics retailer, said first-
quarter profit surged 66 percent after it opened more stores.  Net income for the three months ended March 31 rose to 552
million yuan ($85 million) from 332.6 million yuan a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the  Hong Kong  stock
exchange today. Sales gained 16 percent to 13.7 billion yuan.  The Beijing-based home appliance retailer had 30 net store
openings in the first quarter, bringing the total to 856, Fang Wei, the company’s acting chief financial officer, said on a
conference call today.  “Judging from progress on site selection and contract
signing, it would be very likely to reach the full-year target
of 260 new stores,” Fang said. April, September and December
are usually the peak times for store openings as major shopping
seasons follow, he said.  Gome has been focusing on opening outlets in targeted
regions, speeding up expansion in smaller cities and tapping
into the Internet-commerce market in a bid to compete with
larger rival Suning Appliance Co.  Gome said yesterday it wants online sales to account for
more than 10 percent of revenue in two to three years, and will
keep prices competitive through bulk purchases from its
suppliers.  Capital Spending   Fang said the company targets 1 billion to 1.5 billion yuan
in capital spending for the year and has no need to raise
capital for operational purposes. The gross margin may continue
to move up from 18.6 percent at the end of the first quarter, he
said.  The stock slid 0.7 percent to HK$2.81 at the 4 p.m. close
in Hong Kong, compared with a 0.7 percent gain for the  Hang Seng
Index. (HSI)  Gome’s shares have climbed 25 percent in the past year.  Former chairman  Chen Xiao  stepped down in March after
losing a battle with the company’s jailed billionaire founder,
 Huang Guangyu , over the pace of store openings.  Chen said this month the company is overcharging suppliers
and its plan for new store openings is impossible to reach, the
21st Century Business Herald reported May 11.  Huang, also known as Wong Kwong Yu, and his wife, Lisa  Du Juan , own 32.2 percent of Gome, while Bain Capital LLC holds 9.9
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  --Marco Lui and Michael Wei. Editors: Chua Kong Ho, Nicholas
