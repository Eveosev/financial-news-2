Gasoline rose a fifth consecutive day
on speculation that refinery outages in the Midwest will reduce
supply and that demand for the motor fuel will rise during the
three-day Memorial Day holiday weekend.  Futures advanced 1.1 percent on reports of upsets at
Illinois refineries owned by Marathon Oil Corp. and Exxon Mobil
Corp. Prices at the pump have fallen 4.3 percent since May 6,
AAA data show.  “The uncertainty about these refinery glitches have given
us some support and, when you get ahead of the holiday, people
are going to speculate we’re going to get some good demand,”
said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest in
 Chicago .  Gasoline for June delivery increased 3.21 cents to settle
at $3.0483 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was
the highest settlement since May 13. The premium of gasoline
over crude oil, or the crack spread, based on July contracts,
rose $1.97 to $26.09 a barrel, the highest level since May 16.  This weekend’s three-day Memorial Day holiday period is the
traditional kickoff of the summer driving season.  On a four-week average, gasoline demand in the week ended
May 20 was 2.1 percent below a year earlier, according to Energy
Department data. Supplies increased 3.79 million barrels to
209.7 million, a seven-week high.  Inventories in the Midwest, or Padd 2 region, gained
543,000 barrels last week to 48.6 million.  Regular retail gasoline dropped 0.1 cent to $3.813 a
gallon, AAA said on its website.  Heating oil for June delivery rose 0.26 cent to settle at
$2.9829 a gallon on the exchange, the highest settlement since
May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
