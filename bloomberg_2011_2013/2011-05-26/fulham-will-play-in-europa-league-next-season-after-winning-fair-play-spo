Fulham soccer club will play in next
year’s Europa League in the English Premier League’s Fair Play
spot.  Chelsea, which already qualified for the  Champions League ,
won the Fair Play award, leaving Fulham the highest-ranked team
that hadn’t already won a place in a European competition, the
Premier League said today in an e-mailed statement.  England  won
the extra spot based on fair-play reports from European
competitions involving club and national teams.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
