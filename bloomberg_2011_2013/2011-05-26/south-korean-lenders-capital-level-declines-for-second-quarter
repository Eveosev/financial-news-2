South Korean  lenders’ average capital
adequacy ratio fell for a second straight quarter following
dividend payments for 2010 and an increase in riskier assets.  The ratio, a measure of capital reserves against assets at
risk under the Basel II standard, slipped to 14.23 percent as of
March 31 on a preliminary basis from a revised 14.55 percent
three months earlier, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said in
a statement. The ratio stood at 14.62 percent as of September.  New Basel III capital rules agreed by global regulators
last year are likely to force banks to hold more equity and
easy-to-sell assets. While large Korean lenders weathered the
global financial crisis without needing state bailouts, a surge
in funding costs in international markets in late 2008 prompted
the government to guarantee bank debts.  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s South Korean unit posted the highest
capital adequacy ratio of 17 percent, the regulator said in the
e-mailed statement in  Seoul . The levels for all 18 banks were
above the guideline of 10 percent, it said.  The average Tier 1 ratio shrank to 11.21 percent from 11.58
percent at the end of December, the regulator said.  The Financial Supervisory Service said it will continue
monitoring local banks to secure healthy capital adequacy ratios
before implementing Basel III regulations and to factor in the
potential risks from real estate loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
