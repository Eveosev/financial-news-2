Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO) , a producer of  iron ore 
in Ukraine, said total output from Jan. 1 to April 30 was 3
million metric tons, in line with company forecasts.  Output of higher-grade 65 percent Fe pellets from
Ferrexpo’s own ore increased 6.9 percent from a year earlier,
the company said today in a statement. Price increases in the
first quarter reflected “international benchmark pricing” for
the majority of Ferrexpo’s contracts, it said.  Ferrexpo said May 5 it produced 719,400 tons of pellets
from its own ore in April. That’s an increase of 2.5 percent
from March and a decline of 2.8 percent from a year earlier,
according to the Baar, Switzerland-based company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
