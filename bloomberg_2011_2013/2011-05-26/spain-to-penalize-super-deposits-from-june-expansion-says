Spain ’s finance ministry is pushing
ahead with rules to penalize banks that offer rates on deposits
it deems to be over-aggressive and plans to have new regulations
in place in June to control them, Expansion reported.  Finance Minister Elena Salgado wants the new rules on so-
called “super deposits” to be approved by the cabinet in its
meeting on June 10, the newspaper said, without saying where it
got the information. The rules, which would apply to deposits
that offer rates above 1 percentage point over the 12-month
euribor rate, would force lenders that offer them to make an
extra contribution to the deposit guarantee fund, thereby making
them less attrative to offer to clients, Expansion said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
