The  U.S. population  is getting older,
and the oldest states are graying the fastest.  The median U.S. age climbed to a record 37.2 in 2010, and
New England accounted for six of the 10 states with the highest
numbers, Census Bureau data released today show.  Maine , where
half of all people are older than 42.7, topped the national
list.  Utah , with a median age of 29.2, was the youngest state.  The new census figures reflect a diverse population that’s
aging and less likely to live in a traditional household. The
number of single mothers grew three times faster than married
couples, the ranks of those 85 and older surged, and nonwhites
gained twice as much as whites.  William Frey , a demographer at
the Brookings Institution in  Washington , said the U.S. is
dividing into older white and younger minority spheres.  “There are geographic splits and generational splits,”
Frey said. “We’re really pulling apart as a country.”  States that saw rapid growth during the decade, such as
Arizona, Nevada and Texas, owed much of it to minority children,
Frey said in a  report  last month. Ninety-five percent of
Texas’s growth in child population consisted of Hispanics. The
U.S. population of white children fell by 4.3 million, while
Hispanic and Asian children grew by 5.5 million, the report
said.  The median age, which increased from 35.3 in 2000, rose in
every state, dropping only in the District of Columbia, where
it fell to 33.8 from 34.6 in 2000, the 2010 Census shows.  Polygamist Town  The number of those over 65 grew 15.1 percent, compared
with a 9.7 percent gain for the U.S. population.  Meanwhile, the youngest town is Colorado City in northwest
 Arizona , which was founded in 1913 as a haven for polygamists.
Its 4,821 people have a median age of 12.6 -- younger even than
Boys Town, Nebraska, where the median age is 16.7, or Kiryas
Joel,  New York , a predominantly Hasidic community about 60
miles north of New York City, where the median age is 13.2.  Among states, Maine overtook both West Virginia and
 Florida  as the one with the highest median age. Much of the
increase was driven by “senior seniors,” or people older than
85, and a decline in young people.  Len Kaye , director of the University of Maine’s Center on
Aging, said the state has become a retirement destination,
especially for former residents returning after having earlier
left to get jobs.  “We do have cold winters,” Kaye said. “But it’s a
relatively safe place to live, a less-costly place to live, and
for some, it’s a return to a familiar place.”  Old  New England   The other New England states in the top 10 for median age
are  Vermont , ranked second at 41.5; New Hampshire, 41.1;
 Connecticut , 40;  Rhode Island , 39.4; and Massachusetts, 39.1.  Nationwide, the number of people older than 85 jumped 29.6
percent, the census figures show. One of every 40 people living
in Rhode Island, North Dakota and  Iowa  are well into their
ninth decade of life.  The oldest cities in the U.S. remain mostly in the Sunbelt
states of Florida and Arizona. Penney Farms, a north Florida
retirement community of 749 people founded by department store
owner James C. Penney in 1926, boasted an average age of 80.7,
the oldest in the nation.  More than half the town, designed for retired lay people,
ministers, missionaries and other church workers, is taken up
by the  Penney Retirement Community .  Singles Outpace Couples  The number of single Americans grew faster than married
couples over the decade, rising by 27.2 million, or 9.6 percent.
The number of married Americans increased by 2 million, or just
3.5 percent.  The ranks of single mothers grew three times faster than
married couples. Their numbers rose by 39.9 percent in  Nevada ,
30.8 percent Arizona and 28.7 percent in North Carolina. Single
mother-led households fell by 3.7 percent in New York and 13.8
percent in the District of Columbia.  The percentage of married couples with children fell 5.3
percent from 2000, to 23.8 million. The decrease was sharpest
in Vermont, where the numbers fell 19.1 percent. The increase
was highest in Nevada, where the number of households with
married couples with children rose 18.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
