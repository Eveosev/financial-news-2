Wheat rose for a second day in
Chicago on speculation dry weather may have hurt crops in
 France , Germany and the U.K., the largest European producers.
Corn and soybeans gained amid planting delays in the U.S.  French wheat sellers aren’t committing supplies as the
drought has made production uncertain, Bourges, France-based
farm adviser Offre et  Demande Agricole  said on its website. The
U.K. has lost as much as 20 percent of its crops to dry weather,
Allan Wilkinson, head of agriculture for HSBC Bank Plc, said
this week.  “Concern about the dry weather in  Europe  has come back to
the forefront and is supporting the prices,” Offre et Demande
Agricole said in a daily note today. “The current heat is very
detrimental to yields.”  Wheat for July delivery advanced 16.75 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $8.1325 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain jumped 76 percent in the past
year. Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris rose 5.50 euros, or 2.2 percent, to 250.25 euros
($354.63) a metric ton.  Corn and soybeans gained for a second day on speculation
rain this week in the U.S. Midwest and northern Great Plains may
extend seeding delays in the country, the biggest exporter of
both crops, threatening to curb yields.  U.S. Storms  Storms from Iowa to Ohio may bring as much as 1.5 inches of
rain by May 26, AccuWeather Inc. forecast.  North Dakota , the
biggest U.S. grower of wheat, may get an inch by May 29,
according to QT Weather Inc. Corn, soybean and spring-wheat
 planting  is behind the normal pace because of excess rain, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show.  Corn for July delivery increased 5.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $7.4775 a bushel in  Chicago . The grain last month reached
$7.8875, the highest price since June 2008, and more than
doubled in the past year.  July-delivery soybeans gained 9 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$13.86 a bushel. The oilseed climbed 48 percent in the past
year, helped by demand from  China , the world’s biggest soybean
importer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
