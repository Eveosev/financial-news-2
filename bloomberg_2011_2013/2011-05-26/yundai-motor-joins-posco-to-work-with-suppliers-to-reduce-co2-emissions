Five South Korean companies including
 Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Posco (005490)  agreed to support small suppliers in
their carbon emissions-reduction ventures through project
financing and technology transfer, the government said.  In return, the larger companies, which include  Hynix
Semiconductor Inc. (000660) , Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co. and  Honam
Petrochemical Corp. (011170) , will receive carbon credits, the Ministry
of Knowledge Economy said in a statement today.  The cooperation may result in as much as 1 trillion won
($917 million) of investments in small suppliers and
subcontractors over the next 10 years, according to the ministry.  South Korea said in 2009 it would voluntarily cut  carbon
emissions  by 30 percent by the end of this decade. The
government of Asiaâ€™s fourth-biggest polluter is also seeking to
adopt carbon emission trading in 2015.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
