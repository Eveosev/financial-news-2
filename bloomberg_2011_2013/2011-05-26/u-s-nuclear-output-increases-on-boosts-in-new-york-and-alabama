U.S. nuclear-power production rose
for a third day on increased output from reactors in  New York ,
New Hampshire, Alabama and Minnesota, the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  said.  Power generation nationwide increased by 1,301 megawatts,
or 1.6 percent, from yesterday to 80,783 megawatts, or 80
percent of capacity, the most since April 1, according to an NRC
report today and data compiled by Bloomberg. Nineteen of the
nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased output from the 1,020-megawatt
Indian Point 2 reactor to 63 percent of capacity from 1 percent
yesterday after shutting it on May 20 to replace three high-
voltage bushings on a main electrical transformer.  The 1,025-megawatt Unit 3, the other operating reactor at
the site, is running at full capacity. The plant is about 27
miles (43 kilometers) north of New York City.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  boosted the 1,295-megawatt Seabrook
reactor in New Hampshire to 94 percent of capacity from 69
percent yesterday. The plant, 13 miles south of Portsmouth, was
shut for refueling April 1.  The  Tennessee Valley Authority  increased output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 to 43 percent of capacity from 21
percent yesterday as the plant powered up after storms on April
27 knocked out parts of the regional transmission grid.  The 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 is operating at 21
percent of capacity and the 1,115-megawatt Browns Ferry 3 is
expected to resume service after further repairs to transmission
lines.  There was no damage to the plant, located 84 miles north of
Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee line.  Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL)  increased output from the 572-megawatt
Monticello reactor in Minnesota to 35 percent of capacity from
13 percent yesterday. The plant, 37 miles northwest of
Minneapolis, shut for refueling on March 7.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
