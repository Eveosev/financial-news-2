MSNBC  host Ed Schultz will take one
week of unpaid leave after making disparaging remarks about
commentator Laura Ingraham on his radio show.  Schultz offered to take one week of unpaid leave, which
will begin following tonight’s show, MSNBC said today in an e-
mailed statement.  On his radio show yesterday, Schultz twice called Ingraham,
who had criticized President Obama on the Fox News show “Fox
and Friends,” a “slut,” the New York Times reported.  “Remarks of this nature are unacceptable and will not be
tolerated,” MSNBC said. The cable-news network is part of NBC
Universal Inc., controlled by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   To contact the reporter on this story:
