Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , the
country’s biggest telephone company, reported first-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates after a gain from selling
Brazilian Internet provider UOL.  Net income climbed to 129.7 million euros ($184 million)
from 100.3 million euros a year earlier, the Lisbon-based
company said today in a regulatory filing. That beat the average
analyst estimate of 79.8 million euros in a Bloomberg survey.
The company recorded a 38-million euro gain from the completed
sale of UOL.  Revenue dropped to 871.1 million euros from a restated
906.9 million euros. Portugal Telecom sold its stake in Vivo
Participacoes SA, Brazil’s largest wireless operator, to
Telefonica SA for 7.5 billion euros last year. Vivo accounted
for about half the company’s revenue. First-quarter profit
benefited from lower net interest expenses because of the Vivo
transaction, the company said.  Portugal Telecom rose 0.9 percent to 8.70 euros as of 8:31
a.m. in Lisbon trading.  In March, Portugal Telecom bought a stake in Telemar Norte
Leste SA, also known as Oi,  Brazil ’s largest fixed-line
operator.  Revenue dropped 6.6 percent at the Portuguese fixed-line
unit, hurt by a decline of revenue from corporate clients. Sales
dropped 12.4 percent at the TMN unit, the leader in the
country’s wireless market, hurt by a cut in interconnection
rates and a decline in customer revenue as clients opt for lower
pricing plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
