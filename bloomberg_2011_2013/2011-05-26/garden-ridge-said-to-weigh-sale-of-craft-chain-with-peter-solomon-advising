Garden Ridge Corp., the Houston-based
home-decor and craft chain, is exploring a possible sale, said
two people with knowledge of the matter.  Peter J. Solomon Co. is advising on a possible deal and may
draw interest from buyout firms, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the process isn’t public. Garden Ridge
sells furniture, decor and garden items in about 50 stores
across the U.S., according to its  website .  The chain went private more than a decade ago in a takeover
by New York-based GRDG Holdings LLC, which then valued Garden
Ridge at $185 million. The retailer filed for  bankruptcy
protection  in 2004, partly to obtain better terms on its leases,
emerging the next year.  Diane Coffey, a spokeswoman for New York-based Solomon,
declined to comment. Calls and e-mails to Garden Ridge’s Houston
headquarters weren’t immediately returned.  Buyout firms are increasingly looking at consumer
companies, aiming to profit from a recovering economy. Private-
equity deals involving consumer companies have almost doubled to
$68.9 billion this year, from $39.5 billion for the same period
in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
