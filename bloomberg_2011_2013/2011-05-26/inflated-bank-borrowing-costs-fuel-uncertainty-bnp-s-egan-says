Martin Egan, head of primary markets
at BNP Paribas SA, discusses his outlook for capital markets. He
was speaking at the International Capital Market Association
Annual Conference in Paris:  “If I look at the borrowing costs for many of the
financial issuers in the market, people are borrowing money at
fairly inflated levels, which won’t change, potentially go
higher. Many corporate clients are borrowing money from those
banks at lower levels than those banks actually borrow money
themselves, and that’s not going to work out in the longer
term.”  “I think the outlook generally is very uncertain, and I
think for all of those of us who manage a business or an
activity, the lack of visibility looking ahead is quite a
concern.”  “Another concern I have is the global interest rate
policy. I remember very well 1994 when the Fed started hiking
rates very aggressively and the very detrimental effect that had
on markets overall.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
