Japanese  stock futures  were little
changed as the yen strengthened after a report showed the U.S.
economy has slowed, reducing the earnings outlook for Japanese
exporters. Australian futures advanced.  American depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., which gets
almost half its revenue from outside Japan, fell 0.5 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo after the yen strengthened
to a one-week high against the dollar as reports showed the U.S.
economy grew less than forecast and jobless claims unexpectedly
rose. Those of  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s largest exporter of consumer
electronics, declined 1.2 percent after the company forecast
profit that missed analysts’ estimate. ADRs of  Westpac Banking
Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s second-largest lender, advanced 0.4 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,550 in Chicago yesterday, unchanged from in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,540 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Both the GDP and initial jobless claims in the U.S. were
not good, so worries about a slowdown in the economy will likely
increase,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc. “However, Japanese stocks are cheap in
terms of valuations.”  U.S. Economy  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,325.69 yesterday as higher-than-estimated corporate profits at
companies including Tiffany & Co. overshadowed data showing the
economy grew at a slower rate than forecast and jobless claims
rose.  Economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, reflecting a smaller gain in  consumer spending 
than previously calculated. That compared with a 3.1 percent
expansion in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures
showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for 2.2 percent growth.  Unemployment claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 last
week, Labor Department figures showed. The median estimate of
economists was for a drop to 404,000.  In Europe, Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads the
group of euro-area finance ministers, said the  International
Monetary Fund  may not release its portion of a 12 billion-euro
($17 billion) aid payment to Greece next month.  Yen Rises  The yen rose to as much as 81.16 against the dollar, the
strongest level since May 18, from 81.75 at the close of  stock
trading  in  Tokyo  yesterday. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
appreciated to 114.47, compared with 115.99. A stronger yen
reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas revenue is
converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 3.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 5.4 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the
S&P 500 and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for July delivery fell 1.1 percent to settle at
$100.23 a barrel in New York yesterday. Copper for delivery in
three months lost 0.5 percent in  London  yesterday.  Sony said its full-year net loss widened to 259.6 billion
yen ($3.19 billion) from 40.8 billion yen in the year ended
March 31. The company forecast profit of 80 billion yen this
fiscal year, lower than the 115.9 billion yen average estimate
of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Japanese consumer prices for April will be announced at
8:30 a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
