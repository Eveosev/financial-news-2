Tunisia ’s revolution has done more to
advance democracy in the Middle East than any military action by
western countries in the region,  Joseph Stiglitz  wrote in the
Financial Times.  Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University who won the
2001 Nobel Prize for economics, said U.S. President Barack Obama
needs to give Tunisia the economic help it needs, otherwise the
revolution may stall or go into reverse.  The Tunisian government estimates that it needs $5 billion
a year for the next five years, an amount comparable to that
spent on a few weeks of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq,
Stiglitz said.  Some of the cash would be spent on dealing with the influx
of refugees from  Libya  and elsewhere; some would be used to
tackle social and economic difficulties; some would go on public
investment; some should be put into an innovation and enterprise
fund, to help start-up businesses and create jobs; and debt
relief should also be on the agenda, Stiglitz said.  The U.S. spent $3 trillion on “a war in Iraq that gained
us nothing,” and the return on investment in helping Tunisia
would probably be a million times greater, he concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
