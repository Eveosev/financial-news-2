World wheat production in the year
through June 2012 will be less than forecast a month ago as dry
weather in  Europe  and the U.S. hurts crops, the  International
Grains Council  forecast.  Farmers around the world will reap 667.3 million metric
tons of wheat in 2011-12, 4.9 million tons below the April
outlook and compared with output of 649.1 million tons in 2010-
11, the London-based council said in an e-mailed report today.  Shrinking stocks of wheat and corn have lifted grain
prices in the past 12 months. World food costs were close to a
record in April, according to the  United Nations ’ Food and
Agriculture Organization. Rising food costs contributed to
protests and riots across north  Africa  and the Middle East this
year that toppled leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia .  “The outlook for 2011-12 wheat crops has been affected by
unfavorable weather in a number of regions, especially in the
EU and U.S.,” the council said.  World grain stocks will slide for a second year in 2011-12
as corn consumption outpaces production and dry weather hurts
wheat prospects, according to the council.  Global grain production will rise 4 percent to 1.803
billion tons in the year through June 2012, 5 million tons less
than last month’s outlook. Consumption will advance to 1.812
billion tons, eating into stockpiles, the council estimates.  Wheat prices have jumped 76 percent in  Chicago  in the past
12 months and climbed 64 percent in Paris while corn more than
doubled in U.S. trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
