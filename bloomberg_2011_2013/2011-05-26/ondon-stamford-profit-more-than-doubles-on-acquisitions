London & Stamford Property Plc (LSP) , co-
owner of the U.K.’s third-largest mall, said annual profit more
than doubled on acquisitions and rising real estate values.  Net income for the 12 months through March advanced to 41.8
million pounds ($68 million) from 16.1 million pounds a year
earlier, the Guernsey-based company said in a statement today.  “Our rents will rise over the next year as we’ll have a
full year of rents from our purchases in the period,” Chief
Executive Patrick Vaughan said in an interview. “We feel that
we’re in a pretty healthy state of affairs.”  London & Stamford, founded in 2007 by Chairman Raymond
Mould andVaughan, spent 440 million pounds on acquisitions
during the fiscal year, mainly on distribution centers, to
benefit from rising rents and a recovery in property values.  Net rental income increased to 36 million pounds from 16
million pounds a year earlier, the company said in the
statement. London &  Stamford  approved a final dividend of 3.3
pence a share, bringing the total for the year to 6.3 pence, a
gain of 43 percent, the company said.  Earnings per share fell to 8.3 pence from 24.8 pence a year
earlier as the number of shares increased.  London & Stamford agreed to buy One Carter Lane and Two Old
Change Court from UBS Triton Property Fund for 75 million pounds
in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
