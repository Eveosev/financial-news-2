H.J. Heinz Co., the world’s biggest
ketchup maker, raised its dividend and profit forecast as it
plans to slash as many as 1,000 jobs worldwide.  The cuts amount to about 3 percent of its workforce,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Five factories will
close as part of the plan, the Pittsburgh-based company said
today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer William Johnson said today that the
cutbacks will help improve efficiency and productivity. Heinz,
whose products include Ore-Ida french fries and Lea & Perrins
sauces, also raised its long-term outlook for per-share earnings
growth to as much as 10 percent in constant currency, from a
previous target of up to 9 percent.  Heinz rose 44 cents to $53.83 at 12:58 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 7.9
percent this year before today.  The quarterly dividend will increase 6.7 percent to 48
cents a share, Heinz said today in a separate statement. The
move reflects Heinz’s "strong confidence" in its future, Johnson
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
