Euroclear Bank SA will start
operating in  Chile , giving foreign investors increased access to
the South American country’s fixed-income market, Finance
Minister Felipe Larrain said today.  Brussels-based Euroclear, which provides clearance and
settlement services, will team with Chilean financial
clearinghouse Deposito Central de Valores SA, Larrain told
reporters in Santiago in a conference call from Paris.  Euroclear will allow Chilean investors to perform financial
transactions abroad and permit foreign investors to issue peso-
denominated bonds in the South American country, Larrain said.
The deal could reduce the cost of financing in Chile and will
better integrate the local market with the world, he said.  “News of Euroclear’s arrival in Chile probably is one of
the most powerful developments to have occurred in the financial
market in recent years,” the minister said. “It will speed up
the integration of our capital markets and will diversify the
investor base in Chile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
