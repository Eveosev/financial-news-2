The  International Monetary Fund  said
it is making $170.7 million in standby funds available to Latvia
from its 7.5 billion-euro ($10.8 billion) bailout loan, which
the Baltic nation’s government doesn’t intend to use.  The availability of the funds will “provide insurance
against the impact of any unforeseen deterioration in external
financing conditions,” the IMF said in a statement in
 Washington . The Latvian government has helped to “restore
confidence” and “contributed to economic recovery,” it said.  Latvia’s economy began a recovery in the second half of
last year after suffering through  Europe ’s worst collapse during
the global financial crisis. The Baltic nation plans to sell
international bonds this year as it forgoes further installments
of the loan it go from a group led by the IMF and the European
Union.  “The government has continued to achieve substantial
fiscal savings while also protecting the poorest through social
safety net spending and a temporary public works jobs program,
and is strengthening its active labor-market policy efforts,”
the IMF said in the statement.  Latvia plans a  budget deficit  equal to 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product next year, 1.9 percent in 2013 and 1.1 percent
in 2014, according to a letter of intent that accompanied the
IMF program review, the  Finance Ministry  said today in its
statement.  Latvia is committed to meeting the criteria for adoption of
the euro currency and should focus now on active labor-market
policies to lower the level of unemployment, the IMF said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
