Dubai shares rose for the first time
this week on investor speculation recent declines are overdone
and as emerging market stocks rallied before a report that may
show the  U.S. economy  is growing faster than expected.    Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , builder of the world’s tallest
skyscraper, increased the most in more than a week. Aramex PJSC,
the Middle East’s largest courier company, climbed 1.1 percent.
The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose 0.5 percent to 1,534.35 at the 2 p.m.
close in Dubai, trimming the drop for the week to 3.1 percent.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index jumped 1.2 percent at 2:44 p.m.
in Dubai.  The gain is a “technical recovery as investors saw some
good buying opportunities in the market” after the recent drop,
said Sebastien Henin, who helps oversee $110 million at The
National Investor in  Abu Dhabi . Investors see “the main risk
coming from the eurozone,” which could explain local market
correlation with global stocks, Henin said.  U.S. stocks climbed yesterday before a report that may show
gross domestic product expanded 2.2 percent last quarter, faster
than the 1.8 percent pace initially forecast, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before today’s Commerce
Department report at 8:30 a.m. local time. European policy
makers are seeking ways to restore investor confidence on
increasing concern  Greece  won’t be able to repay its debts.  A decline of 6.1 percent this month has left the 30
companies in Dubai’s benchmark index valued at about 8.7 times
estimated earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 11 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Emaar rallied 1.3 percent, the most since May 17, to 3.06
dirhams. Aramex also advanced the most since May 17 to 1.80
dirhams.  Qatar’s QE Index increased 0.7 percent and  Kuwait ’s measure
rose 0.1 percent. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  advanced 0.2
percent. Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  slipped 0.1 percent and
Oman’s gauge retreated 0.8 percent, its third day of losses.
Bahrain’s BB All Share Index slipped 0.3 percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s
market is closed for the weekend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
