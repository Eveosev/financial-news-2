     May 26 (Bloomberg) -- Wayne Rooney  and five other
Manchester United soccer players starred in a Turkish Airlines
movie that teaches passengers about in-flight safety.  The  film , shot in Manchester, will be aired on Turkish
Airlines flights from next month, and will replace a standard
video that uses virtual stewardesses and passengers, Turkish
Airlines said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nani,  Darren Fletcher , Rafael, Fabio and Chris Smalling
also feature in the movie, the company said.  Turkish Airlines is a sponsor of the Manchester United
soccer side.  To contact the reporter on this story:
