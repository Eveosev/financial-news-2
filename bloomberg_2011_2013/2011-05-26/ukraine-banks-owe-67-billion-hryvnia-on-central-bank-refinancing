Ukrainian lenders owe the central
bank 67 billion hryvnia ($8.4 billion) for financing they
received after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. cut
off international funding, the bank said today.  State-owned banks are liable for 24.7 billion hryvnia of
the total, Olena Myronenko, deputy head of banking supervision,
said today at a news conference in Kiev, the capital. A total of
47 lenders, including four that are now under central bank
management, received funding from the  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy .  Ukrainian banks had written off 10 billion hryvnia of bad
loans, or 16 percent of all non-performing credits, through
March 31, said Natalia Ivanenko, head of normative and
methodological support for banking regulation and supervision.  The central bank has implemented new rules for writing off
bad loans that will help banks clear their balance sheets and
strengthen the banking system, Ivanenko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
