U.S. homes in the process of
foreclosure sold at an average 27 percent discount in the first
quarter and purchases of distressed properties fell to less than
half the peak set two years ago, according to  RealtyTrac Inc.   The discount reflects the price of distressed properties
relative to normal sales. A total of 158,434 homes that sold in
the period received notices of default, auction or repossession,
down 16 percent from the fourth quarter and 36 percent from a
year earlier, RealtyTrac said in a report today. At that pace,
it would take three years to clear the supply of distressed and
bank-owned houses, the Irvine, California-based company said.  “While this is probably helping to keep  home prices 
relatively stable, it is also delaying the housing recovery,”
Chief Executive Officer James Saccacio said in the statement.  Foreclosures are luring all-cash buyers who demand
discounts, pushing down the value of all properties. More than
three-fourths of U.S. metropolitan areas showed price declines
in the first quarter, with foreclosures and short sales
accounting for 40 percent of all transactions, the National
Association of Realtors said May 10.  About 1.9 million U.S. homes are in some stage of
foreclosure, according to RealtyTrac. In the first quarter, the
average sales price of a distressed property was $168,321, down
1.9 percent from the fourth quarter and 1.5 percent from a year
earlier.  The average discount compared with sales of non-distressed
homes was unchanged from the previous quarter and up from 26
percent in the first quarter of 2010.  Biggest Discounts  Ohio had the biggest foreclosure discount, with an average
41 percent, followed by  Illinois  at more than 40 percent and
Kentucky at 39 percent. States where the discount exceeded 35
percent included  Maryland , Tennessee, Wisconsin,  Delaware ,
 Pennsylvania , Oklahoma and  Louisiana , RealtyTrac said.  Bank-owned properties accounted for 107,143 sales in the
quarter, down 11 percent from the fourth quarter and almost 30
percent from a year earlier. Sales of homes in default or
scheduled for auction totaled 51,291, down almost 26 percent and
45 percent, RealtyTrac said.  The sum was less than half the peak of 348,629 distressed
deals in the first quarter of 2009.  RealtyTrac sells default data from more than 2,200 counties
representing 90 percent of the  U.S. population .  To contact the reporter on this story:
