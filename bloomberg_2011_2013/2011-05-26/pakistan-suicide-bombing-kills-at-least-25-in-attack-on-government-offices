A suicide bomber in a pickup truck
killed at least 25 people with an attack on government offices
in the northwestern Pakistani town of Hangu, police said.  The bomb exploded on a main street near offices of the
district administrator, the courts and the police Special
Branch, an intelligence department, said Fazal Naeem Khan,
police spokesman for the Kohat region, which includes Hangu.
While the blast damaged some of the offices, it wasn’t
immediately known whether local officials were among the
victims, Khan said.  As much as 450 kilograms (1,000 pounds) of explosives may
have been used in the bomb, the region’s deputy police chief,
Masud Khan Afridi, said. The officers spoke by phone from their
regional headquarters in Kohat.  No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack,
which follows a series of bombings by  Pakistan ’s Taliban
guerrillas that they say is in revenge for the May 2 killing by
U.S. commandos of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Hangu is about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the provincial
capital of  Peshawar , near Pakistan’s semi-autonomous, tribal
zone along the border with  Afghanistan , and has suffered
previous attacks by Taliban militants based in the zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
