Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s third-largest
bank, cut 500 jobs at its U.K. corporate unit.  A “clear majority” of the 500 took voluntary redundancy
packages, said Daniel Hunter, a spokesman for the London-based
bank. Barclays employs about 11,000 people globally in its
corporate banking unit.  “As part of the ongoing transformation of Barclays
corporate, we are making some changes to our business in order
to optimize growth opportunities and control costs,” Hunter
said a statement. “Regrettably this means a slight reduction in
our U.K. workforce.”  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  is reviewing the
bank’s divisions to focus on operations that deliver the
greatest returns relative to the capital they require.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  said this week it will cut 360
administrative jobs in its corporate and customer divisions and
outsource a further 140 employees from its insurance division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
