KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-traded unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state-run energy
producer, faces protests at its two oil-producing units.  Ten employees of the Ozenmunaigaz unit began a hunger
strike in their cars today after a court ruled that their claims
are illegal, Astana-based KazMunaiGas EP said today in an e-
mailed statement. Another 250 workers of the unit didn’t come to
work to demonstrate solidarity with the strikers, the company
said. Output hasn’t declined, according to KazMunaiGas.  The company said in March 2010 that Ozenmunaigaz was
operating weekends and holidays to compensate for 27,600 metric
tons of oil output lost during an 18-day strike that month, in
which as many as 3,000 workers protested against the company’s
move to a new salary system.  KazMunaiGas EP’s AO Karazhanbasmunai oil unit has been hit
by a strike of 700 workers over wages that began May 17, said
Mikhail Dorofeyev, an Astana-based KazMunaiGas EP spokesman. The
unit’s output “suffered insignificantly,” and damage has
reached 240 million tenge ($1.7 million), he said. The strike
was spurred by conflict within the unit’s labor union and has
also been declared illegal, Dorofeyev said.  KazMunaiGas is in talks with workers at both units to stop
the strikes, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
