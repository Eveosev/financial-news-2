Treasury 10-year note yields fell to
the lowest level this year after a report showed U.S. first-
quarter growth was less than forecast and jobless claims rose,
adding to concern that the economic recovery is losing momentum.  Bonds extended gains after Luxembourg’s prime minister said
the  International Monetary Fund  may not release its portion of
aid for Greece next month, bolstering the refuge appeal of U.S.
government securities. The Treasury will auction $29 billion of
seven-year notes today, the last of three note sales this week
totaling $99 billion.  “We’re dealing with an ongoing series of legitimately
bullish news,” said  David Ader , head of U.S. government bond
strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Yields on current seven-year notes fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.40 percent at 11:55 a.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.625
percent note maturing in April 2018 rose 10/32, or $3.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 14/32.  Benchmark 10-year notes yields dropped five basis points to
3.08 percent. The yield touched 3.07 percent, the lowest level
since Dec. 7.  The 10-year yield could be driven as low as 2.75 percent,
Ader said.  European Policy  European policy makers are seeking ways to restore investor
confidence on increasing concern that  Greece  won’t be able to
repay its debts after last year’s 110 billion euro ($155
billion) bailout.  “There are specific IMF rules and one of those rules says
that IMF can only take action when the refinancing guarantee is
given over 12 months,” Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said today at a
conference in Luxembourg.  A debt restructuring by Greece is “necessary and
unavoidable,” and warnings by the  European Central Bank  that it
can’t be done “are dangerous,” economist  Nouriel Roubini  said.
“The restructuring of the Greek debt is necessary and
unavoidable and that’s in the best scenario,” Roubini told
reporters today at a seminar in Bucharest,  Romania .  Greek Steps  The Greek government this week endorsed an accelerated
asset-sale plan and a package of budget cuts in an effort to
meet requirements for a fifth tranche under its bailout accords
with the European Union, the Washington-based IMF and the ECB.  Concern the European crisis is worsening has spurred demand
for Treasuries even as yields remain near historic lows, said
Thomas Roth, senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc.  “Yields don’t matter when people are concerned about the
return of their principal rather than the return on their
principal,” Roth said.  The government sold $35 billion of five-year notes
yesterday with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.20, the most since
1994. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought the highest proportion since September.  The seven-year debt on offer today yielded 2.44 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 2.712 percent at the previous sale
of the securities on April 28.  Investors bid for 2.63 times the amount offered last month,
compared with an average of 2.85 for the past 10 auctions.
Indirect bidders purchased 39.1 percent of the securities,
versus the 10-sale average of 49.6 percent. Today’s sale is the
last of three note auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  The  Federal Reserve  bought $6 billion of  U.S. debt  due from
May 2015 to November 2016 today as part of its efforts to
sustain the U.S. economic recovery.  The revised 1.8 percent rise in gross domestic product was
the same as estimated last month and compared with a 3.1 percent
gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent increase.  Jobless claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 in the week
ended May 21, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 404,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
