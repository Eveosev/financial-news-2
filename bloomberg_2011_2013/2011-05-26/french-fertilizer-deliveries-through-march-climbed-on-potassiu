French fertilizer deliveries through
March rose as potassium and phosphate sales in the European
Union’s biggest crop producer climbed to the highest in three
years,  France ’s fertilizer-industry association Unifa said.  Potassium shipments rose 47 percent to 543,000 metric tons
from May through March from 368,000 tons a year earlier, Paris-
based Unifa said in an e-mailed statement today. Sales of
phosphorus fertilizer rose 26 percent to 480,000 tons from
380,000 tons.  French deliveries of nitrogen fertilizer for July through
March rose 17 percent to 1.89 million tons from 1.61 million
tons, the highest in at least four years, the report showed.  France is the EU’s largest fertilizer user, according to
the International Fertilizer Industry Association.  Unifa tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a year that
starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium and
phosphorus starts May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
