Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank by assets, said second-quarter
profit rose 2.7 percent on lower provisions for loan losses and
higher  consumer lending .  Net income for the quarter ended April 30 was C$678 million
($693 million), or C$1.60 a share, compared with C$660 million,
or C$1.59, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in
a statement. Revenue fell 1.1 percent to C$2.89 billion.  Canadian Imperial joins Bank of Montreal in posting higher
quarterly profit after setting aside less money for bad loans.
The lender had C$194 million in loan-loss provisions, down from
C$316 million a year earlier.  The bank said it earned C$1.75 a share excluding items,
missing the C$1.80-a-share average estimate of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  CIBC rose 75 cents to C$84.45 yesterday on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 7.8 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent rise for the 10-member S&P/TSX Banks
Index.  Consumer-banking profit rose 14 percent to C$553 million in
the quarter, from C$487 million a year earlier. Canadian
Imperial in September set a C$3 billion annual target from its
consumer lending business in three years.  The CIBC World Markets investment-banking unit profit fell
to C$112 million, from C$189 million a year earlier. The firm
had trading income of C$91 million, down from C$225 million a
year earlier.  Canadian Imperial is the country’s second bank to report
second-quarter results. Bank of Montreal yesterday beat
analysts’ estimates after posting profit of C$800 million, a 7.5
percent increase from a year ago.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest lender,
and Montreal-based  National Bank of Canada , the sixth-biggest
bank, also report today.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the largest
lender, reports tomorrow, followed by Bank of Nova Scotia on May
31.  (CIBC will hold an earnings conference call at 8 a.m. Toronto-
