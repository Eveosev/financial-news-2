European flights operated as normal
after a volcanic  ash cloud  that drifted over the region this
week from Iceland dispersed.  Airports in the Nordic countries and  Germany , some of which
had been shut for several hours yesterday, were open and flying
regular schedules, aviation authorities in the countries said.  There is unlikely to be “any significant impact on
European airspace” from the ash cloud today, Eurocontrol, the
region’s air-traffic control agency, said on its  website .  About 450 flights were canceled in Germany yesterday as a
cloud of ash from Iceland’s Grimsvotn volcano drifted over the
country, curtailing services at Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin
airports. Last year, dust from another Icelandic volcano closed
European airspace for six days, halting 100,000 flights,
according to the  International Air Transport Association .  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) , Germany’s biggest carrier, expects
to operate a normal schedule today, it said on its  website .
 Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) , British Airways and  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  didn’t
list any ash-related cancelations on their sites.  Lufthansa halted at least 150 trips yesterday, according to
Patrick Meschenmoser, a spokesman. A day earlier, airlines
canceled more than 500 flights in  Scotland  and northern  England 
as the ash cloud drifted over those regions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
