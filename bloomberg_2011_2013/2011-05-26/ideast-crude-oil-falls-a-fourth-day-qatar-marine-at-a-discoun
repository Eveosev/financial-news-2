Middle East crude for sale to  Asia 
fell for a fourth day against its benchmark oil because of a
decline in processing profit and reduced demand after refiners
complete monthly purchases.  Murban for July loading dropped 15 cents to a premium of 23
cents a barrel, after reaching 81 cents on May 16, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a premium of 86
cents a barrel for June cargoes, the highest in three years.
Qatar Marine slipped 55 cents to a discount of 40 cents a barrel
to its benchmark, Bloomberg data showed. That’s the lowest since
April 7, the last time the grade traded at a discount.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of refining
profit, was at $17.87 a barrel, a decline of 20 percent from a
month earlier, according to data from brokers PVM Oil Associates
Ltd.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose $1.14, or 1.1 percent,
to $108.73 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai for loading in
July increased 1.1 percent to $108.18 and Murban crude climbed
0.9 percent to $113.10 a barrel.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 45
cents to $5.97 a barrel, data from PVM showed. The exchange for
swaps for August decreased 4 cents to $5.80 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell 99 cents to $108.61 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:39 p.m. Singapore
time, with 801 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$108.77 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
