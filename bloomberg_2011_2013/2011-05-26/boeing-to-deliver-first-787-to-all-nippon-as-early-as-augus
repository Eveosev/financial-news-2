Boeing Co. (BA)  will deliver the first 787
plane to initial customer All Nippon Airways Co. in August or
September, ending more than three years of delays for the new
aircraft.  The planemaker and ANA will conduct test flights in Japan
in the week beginning July 4 ahead of the handover, they said in
a joint statement in Tokyo today. The flights will include trips
from Tokyo’s Haneda airport to Itami and Kansai airports in
 Osaka , and to airports in Okayama and Hiroshima.  Boeing has pledged to deliver as many as 20 Dreamliners
this year after the first handover was delayed seven times by
the use of new materials, engine-supply disruptions and other
problems. Tokyo-based ANA,  Asia ’s largest listed carrier by
sales, has started training pilots to fly the new planes that
will help it cut fuel usage and boost services.  “The plane will allow us to fly to places we couldn’t have
with similar models,” President Shinichiro Ito told reporters
today in Tokyo. “We aim to start flights to  Europe  and the U.S.
by the end of March.”  ANA has ordered 55 Dreamliners, making it the biggest
airline customer for the plane. The 787-9 can fly as far as
 8,500 nautical miles  (15,740 kilometers), compared with  5,625
nautical miles  for the Boeing 767-400ER, according to the
planemaker’s website.  The carrier’s order for 50 aircraft in 2004 was worth about
$6 billion at list prices.  Japan  Airlines Co. has ordered 35.  Boeing gained 1 percent to $76.32 yesterday in New York
trading. It’s risen 17 percent this year. ANA rose 0.4 percent
to 238 yen as of the 3 p.m. close of trade in Tokyo today. It
has fallen 21 percent this year.  ANA aims to add 16 percent more international flights in
the year started April 1, after forecasting a 15 percent
increase in overseas flights a year earlier. The carrier is
boosting flights to cities including Shanghai and Beijing,
helped by the opening of an international terminal at Haneda
Airport last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
