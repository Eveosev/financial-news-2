Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, hired Jason Hutchings as head of its
metals, mining and energy mergers and acquisitions team for
 Europe , Middle East and Africa.  Hutchings said in a brief telephone interview today that he
has left  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , where he worked in the mergers
and acquisitions business in London. He will report to European
M&A chief Wilhelm Schulz and European head of metals and mining
Tom Massey.  Citigroup is rebuilding its energy team after losing senior
bankers last year, including Julian Mylchreest, the former co-
head of energy, power and chemicals in London.  The firm hired Mark Hobbs this week from UBS AG to join its
oil and gas team in Houston and added banker Martin Lovegrove
in March from Standard Chartered Plc as chairman of its global
energy business.  Citigroup ranks third in global energy and mining deals
this year, advising on $27.2 billion of transactions, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based bank advised
U.K. drilling company Ensco Plc on its $7.3 billion purchase of
Pride International Inc. and U.S. coal company Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. on its $7.1 billion acquisition of Massey Energy
Co.  A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
