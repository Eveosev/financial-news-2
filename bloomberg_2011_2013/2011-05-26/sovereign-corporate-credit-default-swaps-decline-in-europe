The cost of insuring government and
corporate debt fell in  Europe , according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 5 basis points to 191. Contracts on  Greece 
declined 10 basis points to 1,407, Ireland fell 3 to 659 and
Portugal decreased 4 to 665, while Italy was 2 lower at 158 and
 Spain  was down 4 at 251, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 3 basis points to 153.5 and the
subordinated index was 3 lower at 255.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 4 basis points to 366,
and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.5 to 101.75.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
