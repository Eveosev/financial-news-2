Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who
leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the
 International Monetary Fund  may not release its portion of aid
to Greece next month.  “There are specific IMF rules and one of those rules says
that IMF can only take action when the refinancing guarantee is
given over 12 months,” Juncker said today at a conference in
Luxembroug. “I don’t think that the troika will come to the
conclusion that this is given,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
