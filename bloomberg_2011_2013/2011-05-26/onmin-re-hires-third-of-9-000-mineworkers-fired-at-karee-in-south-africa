Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the world’s third-largest
platinum producer, said it’s re-hired about a third of the 9,000
workers it fired from its Karee operation in  South Africa 
following an unprotected strike.  “We’re making good progress with the rehires,”
spokeswoman Tanya Chikanza said by mobile phone today. “We’re
definitely over a third.”  It’s still not clear when production will resume at Karee,
which has been stopped since the night shift of May 17, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
