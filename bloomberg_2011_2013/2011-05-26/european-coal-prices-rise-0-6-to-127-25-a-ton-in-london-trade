European coal derivatives advanced in
 London  trading.  Coal for delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or Antwerp with
settlement next year rose 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $126.75 a
metric ton by 1:12 p.m. in London. They have dropped 1.2 percent
this week.  Profit from running coal-fired power plants for next month,
the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 6.91 euros ($9.80) a
megawatt-hour, compared with 2.10 euros from burning natural
gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses electricity
prices in  Germany  and takes emission costs into account.  December carbon-dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system were unchanged at 16.38 euros. Gas for
delivery in the six months through September 2012 to the U.K.,
Europeâ€™s biggest consumer of the fuel, gained 0.8 percent to
64.10 pence ($1.05) a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
