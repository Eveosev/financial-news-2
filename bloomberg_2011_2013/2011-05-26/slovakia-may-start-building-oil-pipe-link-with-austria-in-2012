Slovakia will probably start
construction of an oil-pipeline link with Austria next year,
causing a one-year delay in the project that aims to connect  OMV
AG (OMV)  to supplies from  Russia , a government official said.  The eastern European country will review the costs and
environmental impact of as many as 10 alternative routes by
October and should pick the final trajectory by the end of the
year, Economy Minister Juraj Miskov told reporters in the Slovak
capital, Bratislava, today.  The link will connect OMV’s main refinery in Schwechat,
near Vienna, with the existing Druzhba pipeline from southeast
Russia. OMV has been trying to close the gap in its pipeline
system to diversify supplies and gain better access to Russian
crude. It currently relies on shipments through the Italian port
of Trieste, resulting in high transportation costs that curb
profit margins.  Miskov didn’t state how long construction will take once it
begins although OMV officials have said in the past that the
project should only take about a year to complete.  Central Europe ’s biggest oil company will build the
connection in a joint venture with Transpetrol AS, Slovakia’s
state-run pipeline company. The project would allow an increase
in utilization of the Slovak section of Druzhba to two-thirds of
capacity, resulting in an additional 15 million euros a year in
revenue for Transpetrol, Miskov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
