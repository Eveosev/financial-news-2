South Africa ’s Cabinet supports the
view that the next chief of the  International Monetary Fund 
should come from “emerging countries,” though it doesn’t yet
endorse a particular candidate, spokesman Jimmy Manyi said.  “Cabinet didn’t discuss any names of potential
candidates,” Manyi told reporters in  Cape Town  after the weekly
meeting of ministers. “South Africa is busy talking to the
relevant parties on this matter,” he said, without giving
details of the talks.  South Africa’s Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan yesterday
said emerging-market countries must be given time to agree on a
common candidate for the IMF’s top post. Planning Minister
Trevor Manuel, who has been named as a potential candidate, has
called for a more open appointment process.  The European Union is backing French Finance Minister
 Christine Lagarde , who yesterday declared her candidacy for the
post. Europe has historically put forward all IMF heads. China
and Brazil, the two largest emerging-market economies, may also
back Lagarde over the candidacy of Mexican central bank
governor, Agustin Carstens, as the Washington-based lender seeks
to pick a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn by the end of
June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
