Bank of England Deputy Governor Paul Tucker said he and his colleagues on the Monetary Policy
Committee are “worried” about inflation while the economy
rebalances.  “There is the most extraordinary rebalancing of our
economy underway and it’s obviously painful for some regions in
particular, and lots of households and firms,” Tucker said at
an event in  London  today. “I’m afraid it’s going to take a long
while.”  “At the same time, we are very worried about inflation,”
he said. “My own decisions have since the back end of last year
been finely balanced.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
