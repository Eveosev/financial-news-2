Sugar may rise next week after the
European Union and  Mexico  approved plans to increase import
allowances, signaling demand may gain.  Nine of 10 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said that raw sugar traded in New York probably
will advance. One forecast little change. Before today, futures
for July delivery gained 1.2 percent this week, closing
yesterday at 22.69 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S.  Eight of 10 respondents said refined sugar on  London ’s NYSE
Liffe will rise. Two were neutral. Through yesterday, futures
gained 4 percent this week to $650 a metric ton.  Refined sugar’s premium over raw sweetener probably will
widen next week, according to seven of 11 respondents. Two said
the spread will narrow, and one forecast little change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
