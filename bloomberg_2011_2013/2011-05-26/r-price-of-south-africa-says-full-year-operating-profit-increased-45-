Mr Price Group Ltd. (MPC) , a South African
clothing, furniture and linen retailer, said profit surged
50 percent after it raised prices and shut unprofitable stores.  Net income advanced to 1.01 billion rand ($145 million),
or 3.83 rand a share, in the 53 weeks through April 2, from
673.6 million rand, or 2.60 rand, the year before, the company
said in a stock-exchange filing today. Sales increased
13 percent to 11 billion rand.  “While the group expects a further increase in earnings in
the year ahead, the growth will not be at the same rate as in
the past year, which had 53 trading weeks and included a strong
recovery of the underperforming chains,” the Durban-based
company said.  The retailer boosted its full-year dividend by 46 percent
to 2.52 rand a share. The dividend cover ratio, currently at
1.6, will probably be reduced with the next annual payout, in
light of the company’s strong balance sheet and “cash-
generative business model,” Mr Price said.  The shares rose 64 cents, or 1 percent, to 63.90 rand at
the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, giving the company a market
value of 17 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
