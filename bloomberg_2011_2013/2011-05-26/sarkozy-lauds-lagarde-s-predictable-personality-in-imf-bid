President  Nicolas Sarkozy  praised
 Christine Lagarde , his finance minister and candidate to head
the  International Monetary Fund , citing her “predictable”
personality.  Lagarde, 55, has emerged as a frontrunner to lead the IMF
following the resignation of her compatriot Dominique Strauss- Kahn, who was arrested May 14 in  New York  on charges of
attempted rape. Strauss-Kahn, who ran the IMF from November 2007
to this month, has denied the charges.  “Everyone thinks Lagarde is a woman of great quality whose
personality is quite predictable,” Sarkozy told reporters at a
Group of Eight summit in Deauville, France.  Sarkozy said he’s confident Lagarde will be cleared of her
own legal troubles in time to take the IMF job. A French court
is considering whether to investigate if Lagarde abused her
power in 2007 when she sent a case involving a supporter of
Sarkozy to arbitration. It resulted in a 385 million-euro ($550
million) award to Bernard Tapie, a former Socialist minister who
endorsed the incumbent’s campaign.  “The risks are manageable, as legal proceedings will
show,” Sarkozy said.  Sarkozy said the G-8 didn’t discuss the IMF appointment in
their plenary sessions, though he indicated the topic came up at
side meetings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
