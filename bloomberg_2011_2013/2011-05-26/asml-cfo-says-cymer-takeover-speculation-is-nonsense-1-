ASML Holding NV (ASML) ’s Chief Financial
Officer Peter Wennink said speculation the company wants to buy
 Cymer Inc. (CYMI)  is “nonsense.”  “This is not something we are considering,” Wennink said,
adding ASML is “happy with the current situation” as Cymer is
one of the lightsource-suppliers for its EUV-lithography
machines. Wennink spoke in an interview on the sidelines of an
event in the Dutch city of Eindhoven today.  Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg said on May
18 that Cymer and Nanometrics Inc. are potential acquisition
targets in the semiconductor capital equipment industry and that
ASML would be the most logical acquirer of Cymer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
