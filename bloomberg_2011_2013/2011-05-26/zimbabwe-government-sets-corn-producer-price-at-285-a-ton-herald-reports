Zimbabwe set a corn-producer price of
$285 per metric ton, the  Herald  reported, citing Agriculture
Development Minister Joseph Made.  The price is a 3.6 percent increase from last year, the
Harare-based state-owned newspaper cited Made as saying on its
website. The government gave $60 million to the Grain Marketing
