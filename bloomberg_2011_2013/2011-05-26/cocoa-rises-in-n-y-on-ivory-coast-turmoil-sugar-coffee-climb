Cocoa futures rose to the highest in
more than a week on concern that turmoil in  Ivory Coast , the
world’s biggest producer, will delay the harvest, reducing
supplies. Sugar and coffee gained.  Amnesty International  said both sides in Ivory Coast’s
political crisis committed  war crimes  and warned that President
 Alassane Ouattara ’s failure to condemn atrocities by his backers
is enabling abuses to continue. Cocoa shipments were disrupted
during fighting between supporters of Ouattara and former leader
Laurent Gbagbo following a disputed November election.  “Normalcy has returned to an extent, but it’s not
completely peaceful,” said Erica Rannestad, a commodity analyst
at CPM Group in New York. “Peace needs to prevail for farmers
to return back to their fields.”  Cocoa for July delivery rose $48, or 1.6 percent, to settle
at $3,010 a metric ton at 12:03 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , gaining for the third straight day. Earlier, the commodity
reached $3,062, the highest for a most-active contract since May
13. The price surged to a 32-year high of $3,775 a ton on March
4.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery gained 0.05 cent, or
0.2 percent, to 22.69 cents a pound.  Arabica-coffee futures for July delivery advanced 0.75
cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.656 a pound.  On NYSE Liffe in London, cocoa, robusta coffee and refined
sugar climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
