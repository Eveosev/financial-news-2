Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical Co.’s Noven
Pharmaceuticals unit overstated the efficacy of its Pexeva
depression drug in a promotional card, U.S. regulators said.  The card also “omits and minimizes important risk
information,” the  Food and Drug Administration  told Noven in a
 May 24 letter  posted today on the agency’s website. Noven should
“immediately cease the dissemination” of the promotional
materials and write to the FDA by June 7 to explain its plan
discontinuing their use, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
