Ghana ’s producer-price inflation rate
rose to the highest in 15 months in April as costs in the
country’s mining industry climbed.  Producer inflation in  Africa ’s second-biggest gold producer
accelerated for a fifth straight month to 25.2 percent from a
revised 23.5 percent a month earlier,  Grace Bediako , a
statistician with the Ghana Statistical Service, told reporters
in Accra, the capital, today.  Mining and quarrying, which make up 14 percent of the
index, rose 38.3 percent in April, compared with 32.3 percent
the month before.  Manufacturing costs that make up 70 percent of the index
rose an annual 12.9 percent in April, compared with a revised
11.8 percent the month before, Bediako said. Utility costs
increased 72 percent, unchanged from March.  Consumer prices slowed to 9 percent in April from 9.1
percent in March, the statistical service said May 11.  South
Africa  is the biggest producer of gold on the continent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
