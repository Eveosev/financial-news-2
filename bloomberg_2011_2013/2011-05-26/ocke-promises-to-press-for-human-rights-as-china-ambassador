Gary Locke, President  Barack Obama ’s
pick to become U.S. ambassador to  China , vowed today to raise
human-rights concerns “at the highest levels” of the Chinese
government.  “The administration is troubled -- and I am troubled -- by
the well-documented deterioration of the human rights
environment in China,” Locke said in prepared remarks for his
nomination hearing today before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.  “I will raise human rights issues and individual cases
with Chinese government officials at the highest levels,” he
said.  Locke, Obama’s secretary of commerce and a former two-term
Democratic governor of Washington, also pledged to push China to
curb North Korea’s “provocative behavior” on nuclear weapons.  And he promised to make an expansion of U.S. exports to
China “a big part of what I do every day as ambassador.” China
is the second-biggest U.S. trading partner after  Canada .  If confirmed by the Senate, Locke, 61, would be the first
Chinese-American to become the top U.S. envoy to China. Locke
would replace  Jon Huntsman , the former Utah governor who
resigned his post and now is a potential Republican presidential
candidate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
