JSL SA, a Brazilian transportation
company, plans to expand its services to commodity producers to
reach its target of a 25 percent sales increase in 2011, Chief
Financial Officer Denys Ferrez said.  “The demand is there for the long term, both that which
already exists in  Brazil , as well as the demand that’s happening
in the country,” Ferrez said in an interview at the Bloomberg
office in  Sao Paulo  on May 24. “Some of the new sectors we just
got into, such as energy, we understand that there is a big
potential for growth,” he said.  The industries of sugar and ethanol, energy, steel and
mining represented 37.4 percent of the company’s gross revenue
from services in the first quarter this year, compared with 26
percent in the same period of 2010.  JSL forecast at the end of March sales will increase by 25
percent this year, during which time the company will invest 710
million reais. Brazilian companies are investing in expanding
operations to take advantage of growing demand after the country
grew at the fastest rate in two decades.  Standard & Poor’s  said
yesterday the country’s rate of investment will be about 19.8
percent of gross domestic product this year, and may rise to 22
percent by 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
