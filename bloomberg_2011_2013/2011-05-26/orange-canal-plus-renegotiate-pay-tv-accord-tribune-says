France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Canal Plus  SA
agreed to renegotiate their pay-television alliance at the
Cannes film festival last week, La Tribune reported, without
citing anyone.  Under the new agreement, Canal Plus will get a minority
stake in Orange’s cinema channels, according to the newspaper.
Under the old accord, the companies planned to form a 50-50
joint venture to merge Orange’s cinema series and Canal Plus’s
TPS Star.  To contact the reporter for this story:
