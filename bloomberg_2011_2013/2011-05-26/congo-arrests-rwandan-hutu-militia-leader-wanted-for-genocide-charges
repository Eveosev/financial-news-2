Congolese authorities arrested
Bernard Munyagishari, a former leader of a Rwandan ethnic Hutu
militia wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for  Rwanda 
on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity.  Munyagishari, 52, was detained in Goma, eastern  Democratic
Republic of Congo , after an international warrant was issued for
his arrest, the tribunal said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. Arrangements are being made for him to be transferred
to Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based, it said.  He is accused of training and leading so-called Interahamwe
militiamen in “mass killings” and rapes of ethnic Tutsi women
in Gisenyi, northwestern Rwanda, during the 1994 genocide, the
tribunal said.  At least 800,000 people died in a 100-day slaughter of
ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu militias in the
genocide that started in April 1994. Nine fugitives wanted by
the tribunal are still at large, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
