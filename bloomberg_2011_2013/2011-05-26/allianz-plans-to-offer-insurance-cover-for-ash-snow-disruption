Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Europe ’s biggest insurer,
plans to offer coverage to businesses for disruption to
transport and logistics caused by volcanic ash or snow.  “Customers are asking us to help them with coverage that
also includes business interruption when volcanic ash or snow
brings traffic to an extended halt and as a result affects their
supply chains,” Andreas Shell, head of energy, property and
marine claims at Allianz’s industrial insurance unit, said in an
interview. “We expect to have such coverage ready by 2012.”  Claims related to the eruption of Grimsvotn volcano in
Iceland that halted air travel in parts of Europe for some hours
yesterday, aren’t typically covered by insurers as property
damage isn’t the cause of the claim. Last year, ash from the
eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano closed European
airspace for six days, halting 100,000 flights at a cost of $1.7
billion, according to the International  Air Transport
Association .  “We will offer coverage for business interruption damages
from events such as volcanic eruptions and snow to customers
such as airports and companies dependent on just-in-time
deliveries,” Shell said. “What’s currently on the market only
covers part of the risks that customers want to have
addressed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
