Asciano Ltd. (AIO) , Australiaâ€™s largest
port cargo handler, said workers have stopped industrial action
at three container terminals that had threatened to disrupt
commodity shipments.  The action, which includes bans on overtime, was halted at
the wharves in Brisbane, Sydney and Fremantle, Patrick, the port
unit of Melbourne-based Asciano, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The industrial action by members of the  Maritime Union of
Australia  was canceled two days into a planned week-long
campaign for higher pay and pension payments. Patrick said 26
vessels and 27,950 containers would have been affected by the
action. The company said it has met with the union 24 times and
the parties have appeared before workplace mediator Fair Work
 Australia  10 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
