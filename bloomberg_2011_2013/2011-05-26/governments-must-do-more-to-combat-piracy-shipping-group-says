Governments must do more to tackle
the threat of piracy off the coast of Somalia, said the
International Chamber of Shipping, which represents national
associations for vessel owners from  Norway  to  Japan .  Piracy “is an issue that concerns global trade” as well
as jeopardizing ships and crews, the London-based chamber said
in an e-mailed statement today. It speaks for national industry
groups whose member companies operate two-thirds of the world’s
merchant tonnage.  The International Maritime Organization, the United
Nations’ shipping division, on May 20 approved guidelines for
vessel owners to hire armed guards for defense against pirates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
