Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest oil
exporter, generated $214.9 billion from exports of crude last
year, Jadwa Investment Co. estimated.  The value of the kingdom’s oil shipments rose 32 percent
from $163.1 billion in 2009 because of higher  oil prices ,
Riyadh-based Jadwa said in an e-mailed  report  yesterday.  The country’s total exports, including non-oil products,
reached $251 billion in 2010, up 31 percent, according to
revised figures from the investment-services company. Saudi
Arabia’s combined exports peaked in 2008 at $313 billion, Jadwa
said.  Crude accounts for at least 85 percent of Saudi export
revenues, Jadwa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
