Jack Layton , head of  Canada ’s
Opposition New Democratic Party, appointed a former autoworker-
union negotiator as spokeswoman for finance issues as part of
the “shadow cabinet” in Parliament.  Peggy Nash, a former senior negotiator for the Canadian
Autoworkers Union, will be responsible for the finance portfolio
for the NDP, which won 103 seats in the May 2 federal election,
making the party the Official Opposition for the first time.  “This is a talented and diverse  shadow cabinet ,” Layton
said in Ottawa. “My team is ready to roll up their sleeves and
get to work on the important issues facing Canadians.”  Layton unveiled his spokesmen as members of Parliament
prepare to meet in the House of Commons for the first time since
the election. The government will release a throne speech on
June 3 laying out its agenda and Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty 
will present the federal budget on June 6.  Former NDP finance spokesman  Thomas Mulcair  becomes House
leader, responsible for legislative business in Parliament,

Chisholm on international trade, Paul Dewar on foreign affairs
