OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest
oil producer, said first-quarter profit increased 71 percent as
rising crude prices outweighed a decline in production.  Net income climbed to $3.52 billion from $2.05 billion a
year earlier, Moscow-based Lukoil said today in a statement.
That beat the $3.1 billion average estimate of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Urals crude prices for northwest  Europe  averaged about
$102.55 a barrel in the period, 36 percent higher than a year
earlier, Lukoil said. The company’s oil output declined 5
percent in the period to 1.87 million barrels a day.  “Our major concerns with Lukoil are in place: medium-term
production dynamics and the capex profile,” Lev Snykov and
Svetlana Grizan, analysts at VTB Capital, said in a research
note today. “We believe that negative dynamics in the company’s
crude production are to persist through the end of the year.”
Output has been declining for the past 16 months, they said.  Lukoil shares declined 1 percent to 1,731.20 at the close
in Moscow, after earlier falling as much as 1.6 percent.  Sales rose 24 percent to $29.6 billion in the first
quarter, Lukoil said. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization advanced 43 percent to $5.34
billion.  Slow Decline  Lukoil plans to slow declines in oil output to 1 percent to
3 percent a year by 2013, Leonid Fedun, a vice president and
shareholder in the crude producer, said in  London  today.  Existing fields are declining at a rate of 5 percent to 6
percent, he said at a presentation in London. To compensate for
the declines, new fields with reserves of more than 2.5 billion
tons would have to be brought on stream, he said, calling for
tax changes to help maintain output at aging deposits.  It’s “unrealistic” to produce 550 million tons of crude a
year in Russia, he said.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  called on Russian energy
companies to maintain oil output at 500 million tons a year (10
million barrels a day) for at least the next decade. Output may
each 530 million tons by 2030, according to the government’s
energy strategy.  Russia  pumps most of its crude at aging onshore
deposits in western Siberia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
