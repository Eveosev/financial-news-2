Norway’s  unemployment rate 
unexpectedly rose in March after more people joined the  labor
force  as an economic recovery in the world’s seventh-largest oil
exporter is set to gain pace.  The average unemployment rate rose to 3.3 percent in the
March quarter, from a revised 3.2 percent in February, Oslo-
based  Statistics Norway  said today, citing a survey. The labor
force grew by 13,000 to 2.618 million, while the number of
employed rose by 10,000 to 2.532 million, the survey found.  “The trend in the labor market is strong: employment is
rising markedly,” said Kjersti Haugland, an economist at DnB
NOR Markets in Oslo, in a note. “The significant increase in
labor supply that we and Norges Bank have been expecting is
finally arriving.”  Norges Bank raised its main rate a quarter of a percentage
point this month, its first increase in a year, bringing the
benchmark to 2.25 percent. The bank signaled it will continue
tightening policy to steer  Norway ’s recovery.  The unemployment rate was expected to be 3.1 percent,
according to the median forecast of 12 economists in a survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
