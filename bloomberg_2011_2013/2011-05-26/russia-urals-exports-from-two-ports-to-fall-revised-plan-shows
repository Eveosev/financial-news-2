Russia’s two largest oil export
facilities will reduce combined daily shipments of Urals crude
in June by 4.3 percent from this month, according to a revised
preliminary loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 58 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each will be
exported from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  in June. That’s
equivalent to 1.42 million barrels a day, down 3.3 percent from
this month. A program seen by Bloomberg News yesterday showed 57
cargoes will be shipped.  Exports in June from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  will be
29 shipments totaling 3.078 million tons, or 752,058 barrels a
day, 6 percent less than in May.  The world’s largest oil producer will also ship six cargoes
totaling 450,000 tons of Siberian Light from Tuapse on the Black
Sea. That’s equivalent to 109,950 barrels a day, 2 percent less
than this month, the plan showed.  The final loading program will be released later this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
