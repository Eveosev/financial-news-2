Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ’s board
may discuss writing down its stake in  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) 
tomorrow, Corriere della Sera reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Generali may ask an adviser to give a fairness opinion on
the value of the holding, the Italian daily said.  Spain’s  Telefonica SA (TEF)  and partners Mediobanca SpA, Generali
and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA own about 22.5 percent of Telecom Italia
through an entity called Telco SpA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
