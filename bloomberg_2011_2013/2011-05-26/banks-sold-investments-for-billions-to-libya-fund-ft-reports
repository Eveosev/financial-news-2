The  Libyan Investment Authority , the
North African country’s sovereign wealth fund, lost billions of
dollars on financial products sold to it by western banks, the
Financial Times reported, citing a Libyan government document
posted on the website of U.K. advocacy group Global Witness.  The banks that did business with the Libyan regime of
President Muammar Qaddafi included  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Credit Suisse Group AG and  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, the
newspaper said.  SocGen said it couldn’t comment on individual customers and
transactions; the other three banks didn’t respond to questions
about the document, the FT said.  The Libyan fund also had $300 million invested with Och-
Ziff Capital Management Group LLC, a U.S. hedge-fund manager,
the newspaper said, adding that the firm declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
