Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  Chief
Executive Officer Peter Sands denied a report that the U.K.
lender may sell its South Korean unit.  “We are aware of some false rumors circulating about our
commitment to  Standard Chartered  First Bank and we want to make
it clear that these rumors are entirely incorrect and without
foundation,” Sands said in an e-mailed response to Bloomberg.
“We have made clear our long-term commitment both to South
Korea, and to Standard Chartered First Bank, which forms an
integral part of our international operations.”  Consolidation of South Korea’s banking industry is spurring
speculation that Standard Chartered may want to exit the market,
Reuters reported today, citing analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
