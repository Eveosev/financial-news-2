Tunisia’s central bank cut the
 reserve requirements  for banks to 2 percent from 5 percent in an
effort to boost economic growth.  The bank kept the benchmark  interest rates  unchanged at 4.5
percent, saying that signs of recovery had begun to appear in
agriculture and manufacturing geared toward exports, the bank
said in a  statement  on its website today.  Tunisia’s caretaker government is trying to bring stability
to the North African country, where protests over unemployment,
high food prices and political repression forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power on Jan. 14.  Tunisia’s long-term foreign-currency sovereign credit
rating was cut one notch on March 16 to BBB- at  Standard &
Poor’s , which said the country’s political turmoil this year has
hurt its economic prospects.  The country’s foreign exchange reserves declined to 10.3
billion Tunisian dinars ($7.47 billion) on May 20 compared with
13 billion dinars at the end of 2010, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
