Czech banks have emerged quicker than
expected from a recession and are “in a good position” to meet
stricter regulatory standards, known as Basel III rules, in the
coming years, Standard and Poor’s said.  A gradual recovery of the economy should lead to a further
strengthening of Czech banks, which survived the 2009 recession
without needing external assistance from the government or
private owners, the agency said in a statement today from Paris.
The top three lenders -- Ceska Sporitelna AS, Ceskoslovenska
Obchodni Banka AS and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  --already meet Basel III
capital requirements, S&P said.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  will force
lenders to have common equity equal to at least 7 percent of
assets, weighted according to their risk, including a 2.5
percent buffer to withstand future stress. Lenders will have as
long as eight years to comply in full with the requirements.  Even as Czech non-performing loans rose to a seven-year
high of 6.7 percent of total credits in March, the ratio is
lower than in other eastern European countries, S&P said. Such a
level is largely manageable and should start declining in the
second half of this year, it said.  The Czech economy will probably expand 1.9 percent this
year, slowing from 2.3 percent growth in 2010 as austerity
measures hurt spending, according to the government’s forecast.
Growth will accelerate to 2.3 percent next year, according to
the outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
