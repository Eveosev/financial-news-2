The  U.S. Senate  voted to advance a
four-year extension of provisions of the USA Patriot Act
allowing  law enforcement  to track suspected terrorists with
roving wiretaps.  The Senate voted 79-18 to move toward a final vote on the
provisions, now scheduled to expire at midnight. They would be
extended until June 1, 2015.  The bill’s roving-wiretap section allows federal agents to
obtain a single warrant to monitor phone calls of suspects using
a series of mobile phones.  Other powers in the legislation let authorities obtain
business and library records, and target so-called “lone wolf”
suspects who aren’t affiliated with any terrorist group.  The Patriot Act was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, and
many of its provisions are permanent law. Some of its
surveillance powers have been opposed by some lawmakers and
outside groups, including civil liberties activists.  Both chambers approved a three-month extension in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
