Konami Corp. (9766) , the video-game maker
behind the “ Winning Eleven” soccer title and “Metal Gear
Solid,” rose the most in more than a month in Tokyo trading
after Deutsche Bank AG recommended investors buy the stock.  Konami gained as much as 4.3 percent, the biggest intraday
gain since April 18, and traded at 1,654 yen as of 10:28 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Topix index rose 1
percent.  “I estimate Konami’s social game segment will expand to 20
billion yen ($244 million) this fiscal year from 5 billion yen
of fiscal 2010,” Satoru Kikuchi, analyst at Deutsche Bank, said
by phone. “Also, Konami’s new sport game software is likely to
see stable sales in summer.”  Kikuchi raised his rating on Konami to “buy” from
“hold” yesterday after the market close, and increased the
share-price estimate to 2,000 yen from 1,800 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
