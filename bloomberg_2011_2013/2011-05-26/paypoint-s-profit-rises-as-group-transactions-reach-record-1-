Paypoint Plc (PAY) , the operator of the
U.K.’s biggest cash and Internet payment network, said profit
climbed 8 percent as group transactions reached a record.  Net income climbed to 23.9 million pounds ($39 million) or
35.1 pence per share, in the 12 months to March 27, from 22.1
million pounds, or 32.7 pence a share a year earlier, the Welwyn
Garden City, England-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue declined 1.7 percent to 193.2 million pounds even as
transaction volume rose to 590 million.  The company’s U.K. retail services expanded with net
revenue rising 25 percent, though mobile top-ups continued to
decline, Paypoint said. Trading for the current year is “in
line with the company’s expectations,” Chairman David Newlands
said in the statement.  Processed Internet transactions rose 34 percent to 59
million. The company’s cash or cash equivalents climbed to 26.5
million pounds, as Paypoint repaid a 6 million pound loan,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
