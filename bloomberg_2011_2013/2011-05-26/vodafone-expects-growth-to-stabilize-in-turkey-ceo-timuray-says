Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  predicts that
revenue growth in  Turkey  will “consolidate and be stable”
after rapid expansion in the past two years, according to Serpil Timuray, chief executive officer of Vodafone Turkey.  The world’s biggest mobile company will continue investing
in mobile internet services in Turkey after first-quarter sales
in the segment gained 185 percent from a year earlier, Timuray
said today at a news conference in Istanbul marking the fifth
anniversary of Vodafone’s market entrance. Vodafone bought
Turkey’s second-biggest operator, Telsim, for $4.5 billion
in 2006.  Vodafone Turkey had a subscriber market share of 27 percent
at the end of March, according to the market regulator. Turkcell
Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, the country’s biggest mobile-phone
operator, had 54 percent and Avea Iletisim Hizmetleri AS, a unit
of  Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) , controlled 19 percent.  Turkish sales surged 30.2 percent to 3.7 billion liras
($2.3 billion) in the fiscal year ended March 31, with 28.9
percent growth in service revenue, Newbury, England-based
Vodafone said May 17. Turkey’s mobile market grew 4 percent in
the same period, Timuray said today.  Vodafone Turkey’s users rose to 16.8 million at the end of
March after the company added about 1 million customers in 12
months, she said. The company has invested 10.9 billion liras in
Turkey including the acquisition of Telsim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
