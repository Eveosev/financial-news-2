Canada ’s dollar traded at almost its
lowest level since March as crude oil, the nation’s biggest
export, declined.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell against all of its most-
traded counterparts including the yen.  “Canada is a lagging currency this morning,” said  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of
Canada  in Toronto. “Crude oil is lower. It’s an initial
underperformance for the Canadian dollar, but we would expect to
see some catch-up.”  The currency was little changed at 97.78 cents versus the
 U.S. dollar  at 8:14 a.m. in Toronto, compared with 97.74
yesterday, when the loonie touched 98.16, the weakest level
since March 28. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0227.  The Canadian 10-year bond yield rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.09 percent. The 3.25 percent
security maturing in June 2021 fell 12 cents to C$101.33.  Crude oil for July delivery dropped 0.5 percent to $100.79
a barrel after rising 1.7 percent yesterday. The MSCI World
Index of equities increased 0.4 percent today.  Canada’s dollar decreased 0.2 percent to 83.69 yen,
compared with 83.87 yen yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
