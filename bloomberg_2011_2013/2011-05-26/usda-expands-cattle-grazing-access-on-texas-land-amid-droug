The U.S. government expanded access
to grazing land in  Texas  after drought reduced grass on pastures
in the state.  Farmers in 13 additional counties may use land set aside in
the Conservation Reserve Program for livestock grazing effective
immediately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service
Agency said today in an e-mailed  statement .  A total of 51 counties have been approved for “emergency
grazing” of CRP acres, the agency said. Conditions in the state
range from “abnormally dry” to “exceptional”  drought , the
most-severe ranking on the U.S. Drought Monitor, according to
data from the University of  Nebraska  at Lincoln.  -- Editors: Steve Stroth, Millie Munshi  To contact the reporter on this story:
