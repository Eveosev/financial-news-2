Ethanol futures rose a second day in
 Chicago  as an increase in corn prices signaled higher production
costs.  The biofuel gained as corn jumped on concern supply of the
grain will be tight as the harvest starts in September. Ethanol
in the U.S. is concocted mostly from corn, with one bushel
distilling into at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  “Ethanol markets continue to move around with outside
markets, lacking much direction on its own,” SCB & Associates
LLC wrote in a note to clients.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 0.9 cent, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $2.641 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have increased 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast surged 6
cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.80 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive gained 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.645, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  jumped 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.745 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 2 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.765.  Corn for July delivery added 3.25 cents, or 0.4 percent, to
$7.455 a bushel in Chicago. Prices have doubled in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
