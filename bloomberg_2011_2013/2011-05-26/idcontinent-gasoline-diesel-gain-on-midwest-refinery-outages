Spot gasoline and diesel strengthened
in the Midcontinent and Gulf Coast markets as refinery outages
at two Illinois refineries may increase demand for shipments by
pipeline to the  Chicago  market.  Marathon Oil Corp. was working to restart its Robinson
refinery after a power loss yesterday, while Exxon Mobil Corp.
had a compressor trip at its Joliet refinery.  The premium for conventional, 87-grade gasoline in the
Midcontinent widened 0.25 cent to 5.5 cents a gallon at 1:22
p.m. versus June futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The prompt price rose 3.18 cents to $3.1005.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel in the Midcontinent, or Group 3,
strengthened 1 cent to trade at a 10.75-cent premium to heating
oil futures on the Nymex. The immediate delivery price gained
1.22 cents to $3.09 a gallon.  In the Gulf Coast market, 87-grade gasoline gained 0.08
cent to trade at 11.8 cent discount to July futures. Ultra-low
sulfur diesel gained 0.45 cent to a 4-cent premium to the June
heating oil contract.  In Chicago, conventional gasoline’s premium to futures
narrowed 20.5 cents to 17 cents as it began trading against July
futures for delivery in cycle 1. The price for prompt delivery
dropped 21.58 cents to $3.1754.  “It’s not a prompt barrel anymore, delivery is 10 days
out,” said Lewis Adam, president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply
consultant in  Kansas City .  To contact the reporter on this story:
