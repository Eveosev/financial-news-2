AS Tallinna Kaubamaja,  Estonia â€™s
largest retailer, reported a first-quarter profit as spending
cuts helped outweigh the affect of accelerating inflation.  The Tallinn-based company had net income of 1.6 million
euros ($2.3 million), compared with a loss of 376,000 euros a
year earlier, according to a regulatory statement today. Revenue
rose 2 percent to 96 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
