Four South Korean fuel suppliers,
including SK Innovation Co., were fined 434.8 billion won ($399
million) by the antitrust regulator for agreeing to reject
requests by gas stations to change product brands.  The suppliers, including GS Caltex Corp.,  S-Oil Corp. (010950)  and
Hyundai Oilbank Co., colluded to maintain their respective
market share,  South Korea ’s Fair Trade Commission said in a
statement today. The four companies rejected in separate e-mails
the commission’s claims.  GS Caltex was ordered to pay 177.2 billion won and SK
Innovation 138 billion won, while Hyundai Oilbank was fined 74.4
billion won and S-Oil 45.2 billion won. The collective penalty
was the largest by the regulator after the record 668.9 billion-
won fine paid by six liquefied petroleum gas distributors in
December 2009, according to the statement.  Shares of SK Innovation gained 3.9 percent to 216,000 won
as of 12:23 p.m. in Seoul trading and S-Oil was up 2.2 percent
to 141,000 won. GS Holdings Co., which owns half of GS Caltex,
advanced 2.5 percent. Hyundai Oilbank is privately held.  SK Innovation supplied 35 percent of the nation’s 13,003
gas stations last year, followed by GS Caltex with a 27 percent
share, according to the statement. Hyundai Oilbank and S-Oil had
market shares of 19 percent and 15 percent each.  To contact the reporter on this story:
