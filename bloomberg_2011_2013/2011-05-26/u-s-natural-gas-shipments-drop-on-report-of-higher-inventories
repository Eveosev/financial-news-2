Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators slipped for a second day after the
Energy Department reported larger-than-expected inventories of
the fuel and meteorologists forecast cooler weather in the West
that may limit air-conditioner use.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 8.8 percent to 15.3
million dekatherms (14.9 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the West
fell 3.5 percent after gaining about 16 percent over the past
two days.  Gas stockpiles rose 105 billion cubic feet in the week
ended May 20 to 2.024 trillion cubic feet, the Energy Department
said today. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg forecast a
gain of 95 billion. A separate survey of Bloomberg users
predicted an increase of 97 billion.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  and  Los Angeles  will be
less than 10 percent of normal until at least June 2, according
to Belton, Missouri-based forecaster Weather Derivatives.
Burbank,  California , is forecast to reach a high of 79 degrees
Fahrenheit (26 Celsius) today, falling to 71 on May 29,
according MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Power
plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.6 percent to
23.9 million dekatherms after a 16 percent drop yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to the Southern California Gas Co., fell 4.27 cents,
or 1 percent, to $4.2707 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slipped 0.96 cent to $4.3577 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
