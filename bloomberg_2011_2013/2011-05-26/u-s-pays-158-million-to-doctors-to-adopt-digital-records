The U.S. government has paid more
than $158.3 million to hospitals and doctors this year to
encourage adoption of electronic health records, the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services said today.  The government this year began distributing incentive
payments to health-care providers that meet federal standards
for use of digital health records. Providers can receive up to
$63,750 during six years through the Medicaid program and up to
$44,000 during five years from the Medicare program.  Among the providers of electronic health records are
 General Electric Co. (GE) ,  Siemens AG (SI) ,  Cerner Corp. (CERN) ,  Allscripts
Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX)  and closely held Epic
Systems Corp.  President  Barack Obama  has advocated electronic records as
a way to lower health-care costs and reduce medical errors. The
Obama administration aims to have half of Americans using a
digital health record by 2014 and began distributing what may
total $31.3 billion in incentive payments.  The federal government plans to reduce Medicare
reimbursements to physicians who fail to make the transition by
2015 or later.  #<741227.7672180.2.1.87.23378.96>#  To contact the reporter on this story:
