Germany ’s economy,  Europe ’s largest,
may grow by 0.6 percent in the second quarter as investors and
consumers remain undeterred by higher costs for raw materials,
energy and food, the DIW economic institute said.  While business and consumer sentiment are declining under
the impact of inflation, companies are still reporting full
order books amid strong domestic demand, the Berlin-based
institute said today. The economy grew 1.5 percent in the first
quarter after improved weather allowed stalled construction
projects to be resumed, the DIW said in a report.  “If you exclude construction, what was surprising in the
first quarter was how domestic demand propelled economic
growth,” DIW economist Vladimir Kuzin said in the report. Yet
inflation “is being observed for the first time in sectors
outside energy and food,” the report stated separately.  The German economy may grow by more than 3 percent for a
second year as it sustains a “robust” recovery, the
 International Monetary Fund  said on May 17. Germany’s Economy
Ministry sees growth of 2.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
