Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  said profit
rose 13 percent on gains at its Canadian and U.S. consumer-
banking businesses. Results before one-time items missed
analysts’ estimates.  Net income for the quarter ended April 30 rose to C$1.33
billion ($1.36 billion), or C$1.46 a share, from C$1.18 billion,
or C$1.30, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in
a statement.  Canada ’s second-largest bank said earnings were bolstered
by rising demand for mortgages and credit cards. More than half
of the lender’s 2,400 locations are south of the Canadian border
after spending about $25 billion in the U.S. over the past six
years.  “Even though it’s a Canadian bank, you have to be well
aware that their future is growing in the U.S.,” said David Atkins, vice-president of investments at Cardinal Capital
Management Inc. in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which manages about C$1.6
billion in assets, including bank shares. “They’ve done an
exceptional job doing it, as they’ve built it much better than
others have.”  Excluding some items, Toronto-Dominion said it earned
C$1.59 a share. That missed the C$1.61-a-share average estimate
of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Toronto-Dominion rose C$1.54, or 1.8 percent, to C$85.29 in
trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has
risen 15 percent this year, outperforming the 10-member S&P/TSX
Banks Index.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. time. To
