Total Petrochemicals USA Inc., a unit
of  Total SA (FP) , Europe’s third-largest oil company, said a “power
blip” shut equipment for three hours at its refinery in  Port
Arthur , Texas.  The power glitch caused equipment to shut down from 4 a.m.
to 7 a.m. local time, according to a  filing  with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality. “Equipment was restarted
as soon as possible,” Total said in the filing.  Refinery spokeswoman Jennifer Walsh declined to comment on
the shutdown, saying Total doesn’t discuss its commercial
operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
