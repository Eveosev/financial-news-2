Tanzania put on hold plans to build a
natural gas pipeline from  Dar es Salaam  to the Kenyan port of
Mombasa,  Daily News  reported, citing assistant commissioner for
energy in the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, Theophilo Bwakea.  The project was suspended to prioritize supplies to the
local market, the Dar es Salaam-based newspaper said.  The 600-kilometer (373-mile) pipeline was designed to carry
gas from Songo Songo Island and Mnanzi Bay in southern Tanzania,
the Daily News reported. Canadaâ€™s  Orca Exploration Group Inc. (ORC/A) 
had done preliminary engineering studies for the pipeline, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
