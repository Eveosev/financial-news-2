Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak
said Islamic finance can play a greater role in the global
financial system following  Japan ’s record March earthquake and
tsunami that caused as much as 25 trillion yen ($305 billion) in
estimated damages. He spoke in a speech today in  Tokyo .  “As one of the fastest-growing industries, Islamic finance
has a potential to play a more important role in the global
financial system in this post-crisis era. Islamic finance has
demonstrated its capacity to undertake  project financing .”  On Asian economic cooperation:  “It is vitally important for Asian countries to continue
to cooperate through regional architecture and institutions to
ensure together we emerge as an even stronger player in the
world economy.”  On the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations ’ economic
community:  “Malaysia is fully committed to the achievement of a
viable and substantial Asian Economic Community by 2015. We’re
proud to be one of the driving forces behind this initiative and
we will continue to look at broadening and deepening it well
beyond 2015.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
