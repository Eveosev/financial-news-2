A week-long bidding battle for wines,
paintings and porcelain starting today may push Christie’s
International’s  Hong Kong  auctions to a record.  The sales are led by a Qianlong vase, similar to one that
last year attracted the highest bid ever for a Chinese artwork.
A growing number of millionaires from the mainland are competing
for items from their heritage, as well as gems, watches and
cases of Chateau Latour. The series may raise as much as HK$2.4
billion ($308 million), the London-based auction house said.  “The art market tends to follow wealth and the greatest
wealth is being created in  Asia ,” said Magnus Renfrew, fair
director of Hong Kong International Art Fair, which runs through
May 29. Bonham’s and  Acker, Merrall & Condit  are also holding
auctions in the city this week.  Dealers are watching the event after a HK$3.49 billion
marathon by  Sotheby’s (BID)  last month, where some lots achieved
prices many times their estimates and others failed to sell. The
Chinese antiques trade has an annual value of more than $10
billion.  China  overtook the U.S. as the biggest auction market
for fine art last year, research company  Artprice  said.  The 15 inch (38.1 cm) vase being offered on June 1 is
lantern shaped, with scrolling hibiscus flowers on a yellow
background. The Qianlong vase is estimated at HK$200 million and
has the same pierced decoration as the 18th-century Imperial
vase that was bid to 51.6 million pounds ($83.2 million) at
 Bainbridges , west  London , last November.  Deposits Demanded  Bainbridges said in February that it hadn’t received
payment. It has since refused to comment. Mindful of such
reports, Christie’s has introduced for the first time the
requirement that bidders pay a deposit of HK$1 million on any
items valued at HK$8 million or more.  “I’m getting on a plane this afternoon to look at the
Christie’s vase,” Richard Marchant, director of the London-
based dealers  Marchant , said in an interview yesterday. “If the
piece is in good condition, it’ll fetch millions.”  The six-day event features a  Chateau Latour  sale, which
spans vintages from 1863 to 2009. It includes seven cases of the
prized 1961 in regular bottles and magnums that Christie’s
estimates will fetch HK$650,000 to HK$850,000 each. From the
same vintage, there’s an imperial (estimated at HK$600,000 to
HK$800,000), a double magnum (HK$220,000 to HK $300,000), and a
jeroboam (HK$400,000 to HK$600,000).  Chinese collectors also account for more than half of
 Christie’s  ceramics and jade sales by value, up from virtually
zero a decade ago, said Betty Lin, an auction consultant.  They are also a potent force in 20th-century and
contemporary Chinese art and expected to bid aggressively for
the evening sale on May 28 that features works by  Zhang Xiaogang ,
 Liu Wei  and  Zao Wou-ki , said dealers.  The number of Chinese millionaires reached 670,000 in 2009
according to the  Boston Consulting Group , up from 190,000 five
years earlier.  Last year’s equivalent Christie’s sale raised HK$2.29
billion ($294 million), then the second-highest tally for an art
sale in the city and beating an estimate of HK$1.5 billion.  To contact the writer on the story:
