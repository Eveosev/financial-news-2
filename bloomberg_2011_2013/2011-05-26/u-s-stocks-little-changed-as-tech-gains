U.S. stocks were little changed as
Tiffany & Co. led a rally in consumer companies after earnings
topped estimates and Microsoft Corp. gained, helping the market
reverse an early drop.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,320.21 at 12:35 p.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 0.5
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 0.2 percent to
12,364.31, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.4 percent.
About five stocks rose for every four that fell on U.S.
exchanges.   Earlier losses came after reports showed the economy
expanded at a slower rate than forecast and jobless claims
unexpectedly rose, while concern grew about Europe’s debt
crisis.  The  S&P 500  fell 3.2 percent from an almost three-year high
on April 29 through yesterday amid concern about Europe’s debt
crisis and weaker-than-forecast economic data. Still, the
benchmark gauge rose 5 percent from the end of 2010 through
yesterday on government stimulus measures and higher-than-
forecast corporate profits.  The U.S. economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, less than forecast, reflecting a smaller gain in
 consumer spending  than previously calculated. The revised rise
in gross domestic product was the same as estimated last month
and compared with a 3.1 percent gain in the prior quarter,
Commerce Department figures showed. The median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent
increase.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
