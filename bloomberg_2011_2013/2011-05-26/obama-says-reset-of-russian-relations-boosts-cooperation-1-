President  Dmitry Medvedev  said he is
“not particularly” happy with the U.S. reaction to Russian
proposals on a planned missile-defense system in  Europe  and
warned of “a real arms race” after 2020 without a deal.  “We have to get guarantees that it will not be aimed at
us,” Medvedev said at a press conference today after a Group of
Eight summit in Deauville, France. “No one has given us such
guarantees.”  Medvedev and U.S. President  Barack Obama  discussed missile
defense in Deauville yesterday, agreeing to work together to
maintain the “strategic balance.”  Russia complains that the missile shield, which the U.S.
says is needed to guard against threats from countries such as
Iran, will blunt its nuclear deterrent. Its criticism escalated
May 3, when the U.S. agreed to station interceptor missiles at a
Romanian air base as part of a system that will also include
facilities in  Poland , another former Soviet bloc country.  Russia and the U.S. in February put into force the new
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits each side’s
strategic warheads to 1,550, from the 2,200 allowed previously,
and sets a maximum of 800 land-, air- and sea-based launchers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
