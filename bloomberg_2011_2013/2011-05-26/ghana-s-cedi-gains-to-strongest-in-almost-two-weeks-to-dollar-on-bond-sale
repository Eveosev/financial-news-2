Ghana ’s cedi appreciated to the
strongest level in almost two weeks against the dollar after the
central bank said it will sell 300 million cedis ($199.7
million) of three-year bonds.  The currency of the world’s second-largest cocoa producer
rallied as much as 0.5 percent to 1.5012 per dollar, the highest
intraday level since May 13, before trading 0.4 percent up at
1.5022 by 2:42 p.m. in the capital, Accra, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bank of Ghana  will hold the sale on June 2, it said in
a prospectus posted on its website today.  “The cedi strengthened on the back of the impending bond
auction,” Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the local unit of
Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said by phone from Accra today.
“Anybody interested in the auction, including offshore
investors, were on the market today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
