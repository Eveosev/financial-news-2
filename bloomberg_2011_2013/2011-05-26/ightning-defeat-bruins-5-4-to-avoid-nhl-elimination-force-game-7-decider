Teddy Purcell and Martin St. Louis
each scored two goals as the  Tampa Bay  Lightning beat the  Boston 
Bruins 5-4 to avoid elimination from the National Hockey League
playoffs.  Tampa Bay forced a seventh game tomorrow in Boston to
decide which team will face the Vancouver Canucks in the Stanley
Cup finals.  Purcell scored after 36 seconds and again in the second
period, while St. Louis got Tampa Bayâ€™s second and fifth goals.
Steven Stamkos also scored for the Lightning at St. Pete Times
Forum in Tampa,  Florida .  David Krejci had three goals and Milan Lucic got one for
the Bruins.  Boston has lost five times in the Stanley Cup finals, most
recently in 1990, since they collected the last of their five
NHL titles in 1972. The Lightning won the  Stanley Cup  in their
only visit to the finals in 2004.  Vancouver beat the San Jose Sharks 3-2 in double overtime
on May 24 to win the Western Conference finals by four games to
one. Top-seeded Vancouver is chasing its first Stanley Cup title,
having lost in the finals in 1982 and 1994.  To contact the reporter on this story:
