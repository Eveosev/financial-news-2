U.K. winter natural gas advanced to
its highest price in more than two weeks after  Brent crude  rose
and deliveries from BG Group Plc’s Dragon LNG terminal halted.  Gas for the six months starting in October rose as much as
0.55 pence, or 0.8 percent, to 70.3 pence a therm. The contract
was at 69.90 pence as of 5 p.m. in London, according to broker
prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to $11.43 a million
British thermal units.  Brent for July settlement yesterday closed at $114.93 a
barrel on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, its highest
close since May 10. The contract rose as much as 0.5 percent to
$115.47 a barrel today. Oil costs can boost the price of some
mainland European gas contracts, affecting the U.K. market
because of pipeline links to the continent.  U.K. winter baseload power rose 35 pence to 58 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data on Bloomberg show. Baseload is
delivered around the clock.  Brent has advanced 21 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa halted production in  Libya .  Storage tanks at Dragon in south  Wales  are depleting, and
flows halted at 5:30 a.m., National Grid Plc data show. The site
held about 11 million cubic meters of gas today and has capacity
of 190 million cubic meters. Three carriers are scheduled to
this week supply the terminal.  The  pipeline  between Britain and  Belgium  was exporting gas
to the continent at a rate of about 21.5 million cubic meters a
day, according to a website run by Interconnector (U.K.) Ltd.,
owner of the link.  National Grid forecast gas demand in the 24 hours through 6
a.m. tomorrow at 230 million cubic meters, less than normal for
the time of year. Pipelines in the country will contain 342
million cubic meters of gas at that time, 4 million more than at
the start of today.  Within-day gas was little changed at 57.4 pence a therm.
Gas for tomorrow was at 57.40 pence at 4:30 p.m. Day-ahead power
was little changed at 50.50 pounds a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
