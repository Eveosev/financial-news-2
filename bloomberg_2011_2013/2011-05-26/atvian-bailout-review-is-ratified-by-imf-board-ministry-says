The  International Monetary Fund ’s
board confirmed the staff-level review of  Latvia ’s 7.5 billion-
euro ($10.6 billion) bailout program that will allow the country
to draw additional funds, Latvia’s Finance Ministry said.  Latvia has used about 4.4 billion euros of the money
available from a group led by the European Commission and the
IMF, the statement said. The country plans to borrow only 100
million euros from the  World Bank  before the program is
completed at the end of this year.  Latvia doesn’t need to extend the program as the global
economic crisis is over and the country’s public debt isn’t an
issue, the IMF mission chief for the country, Mark Griffiths,
said April 15 after completing the review.  Latvia plans a  budget deficit  equal to 2.5 percent of gross
domestic product next year, 1.9 percent in 2013 and 1.1 percent
in 2014, according to a letter of intent that accompanied the
program review, the Finance Ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
