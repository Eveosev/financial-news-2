Most European stocks climbed as
commodities increased and investors awaited a report that may
show the  U.S. economy  is growing faster than expected. U.S.
futures and Asian shares climbed.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  jumped 3.7 percent after the world’s largest
publicly traded hedge fund said profit fell less than estimated
and client assets increased. Burberry Group Plc, the U.K.’s
largest luxury retailer, dropped 2 percent even after reporting
an increase in profit. SIG Plc, Europe’s biggest supplier of
insulation, slipped 1.8 percent after BofA Merrill Lynch Global
Research downgraded the stock.  The Stoxx 600 increased 0.1 percent to 277.7 at 8:06 a.m.
in London as four stocks climbed for every one that dropped. The
gauge has risen 5.9 percent from this year’s low on March 16
amid optimism that company profits and government stimulus
measures will keep the economic recovery on track. Futures on
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June increased 0.4
percent to 1,321.5.  Asia ’s benchmark MSCI Asia Pacific Index
surged 1.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
