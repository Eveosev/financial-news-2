OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the oil company controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , sold $2.56 billion of bonds in its debut international
offering, according to a person familiar with the transaction.  OGX sold the seven-year debt to yield 8.5 percent, or 611
basis points more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because he wasn’t
authorized to comment on the sale. The average yield on
Brazilian corporate debt is 5.88 percent, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s index. The company initially marketed the
securities with a yield as low as 7.5 percent.  Batista is turning to debt markets to finance exploration
and investments after reporting last month a lower-than-forecast
increase in oil and gas resources. OGX hasn’t produced any oil
yet and plans to begin by October, delaying a previous estimate
to start in August.  OGX is rated B1, four levels below investment grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service. It’s rated B by  Standard & Poor’s ,
which is one step lower.  Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Itau Unibanco
Holding SA and JPMorgan Chase & Co. arranged the bond sale, the
person said. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
