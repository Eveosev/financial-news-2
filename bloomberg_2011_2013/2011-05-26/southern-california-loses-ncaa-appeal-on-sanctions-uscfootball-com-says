The  University of Southern
California  lost an appeal against sanctions for rules
violations that the  National Collegiate Athletic Association 
said “strike at the heart” of amateurism,  USCfootball.com
reported  on its website.  The Trojans football team must serve the second year of a
suspension from bowl games, the website said, citing
unidentified sources inside and outside the university. The ban
means USC will miss the first Pac-12 championship.  The school will also lose 30 scholarships. The Trojans
football team will be allowed to sign no more than 15 players
to scholarships for the next three seasons, the story said.  The violations “primarily involve agent and amateurism
issues” surrounding former USC football player  Reggie Bush  and
basketball player O.J. Mayo, the NCAA said a year ago.  USC must vacate all wins in which Bush competed while
ineligible, beginning in December 2004. The Trojans beat the
Oklahoma Sooners in the January 2005 Orange Bowl to claim the
2004 Bowl Championship Series national championship, one year
after sharing the national title. The Orange Bowl victory has
been vacated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
