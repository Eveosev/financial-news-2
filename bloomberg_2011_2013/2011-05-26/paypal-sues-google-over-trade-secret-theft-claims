Google Inc. was sued by PayPal Inc.,
the fastest-growing unit at online marketplace  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , over
claims it misappropriated trade secrets from PayPal’s mobile-
payment business.  Osama Bedier, a former PayPal executive now at Google,
stole PayPal’s confidential information, the company said in the
lawsuit filed yesterday in state court in San Jose,  California .
Stephanie Tilenius, another ex-PayPal executive now at Google,
violated contractual obligations by recruiting Bedier, PayPal
said.  Bedier “is now leading Google’s efforts to bring point-of-
sale technologies and services to retailers on its behalf,”
according to the complaint. “Bedier and Google have
misappropriated PayPal trade secrets by disclosing them within
Google and to major retailers.”  Both companies are trying to move into storefronts from
online transactions and build their mobile businesses. PayPal,
based in  San Jose , is working with major retailers to develop a
new type of point-of-sale system -- the equipment next to cash
registers where consumers swipe credit cards.  Google, based in  Mountain View , California, yesterday
unveiled two services to let consumers pay merchants and
download coupons with a tap of their mobile phones.  “Silicon Valley was built on the ability of individuals to
use their knowledge and expertise to seek better employment
opportunities, an idea recognized by both California law and
public policy,” Aaron Zamost, a Google spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. “We respect trade secrets, and will defend
ourselves against these claims.”  Android Talks  PayPal also alleges that Bedier, who left the company in
January, discussed a job with Google while simultaneously
leading negotiations to make PayPal a payment option on Google’s
Android Market. He didn’t disclose the job-related talks, a
breach of his fiduciary duty, the company said.  Tilenius, who left EBay in 2009, was under contract not to
recruit employees, PayPal said. She messaged Bedier on Facebook
Inc.’s social-networking website, telling him she had a “HUGE”
opportunity for him, and sent him e-mails and text messages
offering advice while he interviewed for a position, according
to the complaint.  The case is PayPal v.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , 11CV201863, California
Superior Court, County of  Santa Clara  (San Jose).  To contact the reporters on this story:
