Chaoda Modern Agriculture Holdings
Ltd. (682)  fell the most in eight years in Hong Kong trading after
Next Magazine said the company exaggerated the amount of land it
controls, a report the Chinese supplier of fruit and vegetables
said isn’t “factually accurate.”  Hong Kong-based Chaoda slid as much as 25 percent, the
biggest drop since March 25, 2003, to HK$3.48. Chairman Kwok Ho
bought 1 million shares and the company repurchased 2.2 million
shares, according to exchange filings today.  The allegation comes amid heightened regulatory scrutiny of
Chinese companies traded in the U.S. after some investors
questioned accounting and disclosure practices. Next cited
managers as saying Chaoda overstated landholdings in Beijing,
Tianjin and Hebei.  “We’ve been suspicious of the company’s accounting,” said
Emma Liu, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., who
has a “reduce” on Chaoda shares. “It always has much higher
capital expenditure than peers.”  Chaoda fell 22 percent to close at HK$3.62 in  Hong Kong ,
cutting its market value to HK$12.1 billion ($1.6 billion). Kwok
bought shares at an average HK$3.84 each, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today. The company
repurchased stock from HK$3.64 to HK$3.77 under a general
mandate approved by shareholders in November 2010, it said an
exchange filing.  Expensive Greenhouses  “The contents of the article are not factually accurate
and true,” Chaoda said in a separate statement to the exchange.
“The company reserves all its right to take legal action in
connection with the article.”  The  capital spending  on Chaoda’s “expensive” greenhouses
in Beijing was justified, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts Jake Lynch and Jamie Zhou said in an April 21 report.  The greenhouses, constructed with 0.7 meter thick concrete
walls to protect crops from the cold winters, cost 150,000 yuan
($23,107) per mu to construct, Macquarie analysts said in the
report after a tour of the Beijing site. About 2 percent of
Chaoda’s 5,000 mu (824 acres) of arable land in Beijing is
covered with greenhouses, which can double yield, Macquarie
said. The average cost for a typical Chaoda greenhouse is 25,000
yuan per mu, the report said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has revoked the
registrations of eight China-based companies since December, and
more than 24 firms have disclosed auditor resignations or
accounting problems to the agency since March, Chairman  Mary Schapiro  wrote in an April 27 letter.  Longtop Financial Technologies Ltd., a Hong Kong-based
maker of financial software, said May 23 its auditor Deloitte
Touche Tohmatsu Ltd. resigned because of the falsity of the
company’s financial records.  Chaoda scrapped a planned bond sale on May 9, citing market
conditions.  --Helen Yuan and Debra Mao. Editors:  Paul Gordon , Jake Lloyd-
