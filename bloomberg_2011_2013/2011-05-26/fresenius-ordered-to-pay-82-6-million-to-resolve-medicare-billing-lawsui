Fresenius Medical Care AG, the
worldâ€™s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , was ordered by a
judge to pay $82.6 million to resolve a lawsuit by the U.S.
government and whistleblowers that it overbilled Medicare.  Fresenius must pay trebled damages of $38.9 million under
the  False Claims Act  and statutory penalties of $43.7 million,
U.S. District Judge William J. Haynes ruled yesterday in federal
court in Nashville, Tennessee. The decision was made public
today.  The lawsuit claimed that Fresenius, based in Bad Homburg,
Germany, and two companies it now owns, Renal Care Group and
Renal Care Group Supply Co., overbilled Medicare between 1999
and 2005 for home support dialysis supplies.  Terry Morris, a spokeswoman for Fresenius, said the company
just received the decision and would issue a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
