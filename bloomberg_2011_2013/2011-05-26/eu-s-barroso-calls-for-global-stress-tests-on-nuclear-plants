The European Union called for global
checks on nuclear  power plants  to increase safety standards
following a crisis in  Japan , where an earthquake and a tsunami
crippled atomic reactors.  The EU earlier this week agreed that tests on the region’s
143 nuclear plants should start by June 1 and cover threats from
natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornados and extreme
heat or snow, as well as airplane crashes and explosions close
to atomic stations.  “We want nuclear stress tests to go beyond  Europe ,”
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said today at a Group
of Eight summit in Deauville, France. “The G-8 should work to
promote the highest possible safety standards around the world
for nuclear energy.”  EU leaders in March called for a “comprehensive and
transparent risk and safety assessment” of European atomic
facilities after the accident at Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant. Nuclear power stations owned by companies including
Electricite de France SA and  Germany ’s  RWE AG (RWE)  produce a third of
the electricity in the EU.  To contact the reporters on this story:
