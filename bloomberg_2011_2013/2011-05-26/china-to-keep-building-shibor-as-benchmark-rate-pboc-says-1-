China  will encourage commercial banks
to develop derivatives based on the Shanghai interbank offered
rate, or Shibor, said Li Dongrong, assistant governor of the
People’s Bank of China.  The country will continue Shibor as a benchmark  reference
rate  for its financial markets, according to a  statement  posted
today on the central bank’s website.  Lenders should “reasonably” guide market rates and
exercise self-discipline as the government reduces price
controls, the statement said.  Some banks “sharply” raised yields on wealth management
products and lifted deposit rates “under disguise” as
competition intensified this year, Li said in the statement.
Such practices will lead to “frequent, large-scale” fund
transfers between lenders, disrupting financial order and
hampering the prevention of systemic risk, he added.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors:  Paul Gordon , Joshua Fellman  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
