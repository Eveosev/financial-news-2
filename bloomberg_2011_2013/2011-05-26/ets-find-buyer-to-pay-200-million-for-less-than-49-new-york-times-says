The  New York Mets  have found a buyer
prepared to pay at least $200 million for less than 49 percent
of the Major League Baseball team, the New York Times reported,
citing a person briefed on the matter.  Bankers told of a possible announcement said they were
unaware of who the buyer or buyers might be, the newspaper said.
They also said the team, which lost $51 million last season and
may lose as much as $70 million this one and is hundreds of
millions of dollars in debt, may be trying to retain interest in
the club after potential buyers failed to materialize, the
newspaper said.  The possible deal would exclude a portion of SNY, the
teamâ€™s cable network, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
