Plans by U.S. regulators to impose
restrictions on foreign governments engaging in swap
transactions in the U.S. have provoked a sharp reaction from the
 European Central Bank  and  China ’s sovereign wealth fund, among
other institutions, the Wall Street Journal reported.   The proposed regulations would compel foreign entities to
conduct trades on an exchange, possibly post margin and hold
enough capital to absorb losses, the newspaper said.  The ECB said in a letter sent to regulators on May 6 and
reviewed by the Journal that it would be “inappropriate to be
subject to supervisory requirements by a non-EU authority,”
because such regulation “might not be sufficiently sensitive to
the practice of managing foreign reserves.” An ECB spokeswoman
declined to comment, the newspaper said.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Securities and Exchange Commission have sought guidance on the
matter from the  Federal Reserve , the Journal said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
