Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in May to terminals near  New Orleans  were little changed
relative to Chicago futures as demand for U.S. exports slowed.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 59 cents to 61 cents a bushel, compared with 59 cents
to 60 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The soybean basis was unchanged at 70 cents to 80 cents a
bushel, according to the USDA.  “As far as cash movement goes, the processor has been
working to get some of his summer needs met, but it doesn’t feel
like the river has been as aggressive in that regard,” said
Bryce Stremming, a risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc.
in Bloomington,  Illinois . “The last few weeks we have not had
outstanding sales at the Gulf.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 3.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.455 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
commodity has doubled in the past year.  Soybean futures for July delivery advanced 7.75 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $13.8475 a bushel on the CBOT. Prices are up 48
percent in the past year as Chinese purchases climbed to a
record.  U.S. exporters sold 779,623 metric tons of corn in the week
ended May 19, down 32 percent from a week earlier, the USDA said
today. Sales of soybeans dropped to 157,043 tons, or 5.5 percent
less than a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
