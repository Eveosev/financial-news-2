Minerva Plc (MNR) , the second-largest
developer in the City of London financial district, said funds
advised by Area Property Partners (U.K.) Ltd. and a subsidiary
of DV4 Ltd. may make a bid for the company.  The possible cash offer for the whole company would be at
120.5 pence a share, London-based Minerva said in a statement
today. That’s 21 percent higher than the closing price yesterday
and 54 percent more than the price on Jan. 13, the day before
Minerva announced it was in talks.  “The board of Minerva believes that the level and cash
nature of the possible offer are such that it is in its
shareholders’ interests to progress matters,” the company said
in the statement.  Minerva has been the subject of takeover talk for almost
three years. KiFin, the investment vehicle of Nathan Kirsh,
abandoned a 50 pence-a-share bid for Minerva in January 2010
after failing to win support from the developer’s shareholders.
That followed an unsuccessful attempt by Dubai’s Limitless LLC
to purchase Minerva in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
