Bahrain’s credit rating was lowered
one level at Moody’s Investors Service with a negative outlook,
citing the impact of the recent political turmoil on economic
growth and the weakening of the banking industry.  Bahrain’s government bond rating was reduced to Baa1, the
third lowest investment grade, from A3, the ratings service said
in an e-mailed statement.  “The main driver underlying Moody’s decision to downgrade
is the significant deterioration in Bahrain’s political
environment since February,” Moody’s said in the statement.  The island-kingdom saw anti-government protests in February
and March, inspired by revolts that toppled the leaders of Egypt
and  Tunisia  this year. The protests prompted members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council to send a military force to help restore
order.  Bahrain’s economic growth may slow to 3.1 percent this year
from 4.1 percent in 2010, the  International Monetary Fund  said
in its Economic Outlook in April.  Bahrain’s BB All Share Index slipped 0.3 percent at the
12:30 p.m. close in Manama before Moody’s announcement. The
yield on Bahrain’s 5.5 percent bond maturing in March 2020 rose
2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.67 percent at
3:12 p.m. in Bahrain, according to Bloomberg composite prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
