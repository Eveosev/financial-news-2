BP Plc (BP/)  may divert liquefied natural
gas from its Tangguh plant in Indonesia meant for  Sempra
Energy (SRE) ’s port in the U.S. to PT Perusahaan Gas Negara’s planned
terminal in North Sumatra, a government official said.  As much as 140 million cubic feet a day may be diverted,
 Evita Legowo , director general of oil and gas at the Energy and
Mineral Resources Ministry, told reporters in Jakarta today.  BP and Gas Negara are currently in talks on the price of
the LNG and expect to reach an agreement this year, Legowo said.
Gas Negara will use the fuel to supply PT Perusahaan Listrik
Negara’s power plant in North Sumatra, she said.  Indonesia ,  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy and the world’s
third-biggest LNG exporter, is trying to boost domestic use of
the cleaner-burning fuel to make up for declining oil production.
Aging fields led to the country’s withdrawal from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008.  Gas Negara, based in Jakarta, allocated $250 million to
build the Belawan LNG receiving terminal, Riza Pahlevi Tabrani,
finance director at Indonesia’s largest distributor of the fuel,
said in September.  LNG is natural gas chilled to liquid form for
transportation by ships to places not connected by pipelines.
Qatar and Malaysia are the world’s largest and second-biggest
exporters of the fuel, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
