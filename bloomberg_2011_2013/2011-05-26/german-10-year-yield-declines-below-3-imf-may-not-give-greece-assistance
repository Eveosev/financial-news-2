German  government bonds  extended
their advance after Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude
Juncker  said the  International Monetary Fund  may not release its
portion of aid for  Greece  next month.  The 10-year bund yield fell five basis points to 2.998
percent as of 3:03 p.m. in London, the first time below 3
percent since Jan. 14. Two-year yields were four basis points
lower at 1.62 percent.  “There are specific IMF rules and one of those rules says
that IMF can only take action when the refinancing guarantee is
given over 12 months,” Juncker said today at a conference in
Luxembourg. “I don’t think that the troika will come to the
conclusion that this is given,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
