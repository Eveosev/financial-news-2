Nigeria â€™s oil output will boom if a
government amnesty for fighters in the oil-producing Niger River
Delta persists,  Vanguard  said, citing Mutiu Sunmonu, the
managing director of Shell Petroleum Development Co. of Nigeria.  Shell now has access to offshore oilfields and facilities
and can clean-up oil spills in areas which were previously
inaccessible because of militant activities, the Lagos-based
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
