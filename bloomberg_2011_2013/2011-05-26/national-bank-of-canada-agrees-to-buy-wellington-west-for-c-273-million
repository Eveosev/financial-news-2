National Bank of Canada (NA) , the best-
performing Canadian bank stock this year, agreed to buy
Wellington West Holdings Inc. for C$273 million ($279.2 million)
in cash and stock to expand its asset-management business.  Wellington West has about C$10 billion in assets under
administration and 223 advisers across  Canada , Montreal-based
National Bank said today in a statement. National Bank already
owns 18.2 percent of the brokerage.  National Bank said the acquisition will add to its wealth-
management business, expanding its client base outside of
Quebec. The company will have 983 advisers across Canada
following the transaction and assets under administration of
about C$67 billion.  The purchase values Wellington at C$333 million, including
excess cash of C$74 million. National will offer as many as 2.2
million shares in the cash and stock purchase.  National Bank said the transaction will reduce its Tier 1
capital ratio under Basel III rules by about 20 basis points.  CIBC World Markets  advised Winnipeg, Manitoba-based
Wellington on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
