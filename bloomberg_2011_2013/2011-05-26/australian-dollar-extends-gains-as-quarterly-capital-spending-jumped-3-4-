The Australian dollar extended gains
after a government report showed that business investment rose
3.4 percent in the first quarter from the final three months of
2010. That was faster than the 2.7 percent increase forecast by
a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  The currency climbed to $1.0586 as of 11:34 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0566 before the report and $1.0532 yesterday in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
