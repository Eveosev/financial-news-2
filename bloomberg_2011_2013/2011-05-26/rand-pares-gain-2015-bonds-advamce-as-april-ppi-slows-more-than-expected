South Africa ’s rand pared earlier
gains and bonds rallied after producer inflation slowed by more
than analysts expected in April.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest economy traded 0.4 percent
stronger at 6.9947 per dollar at 11:31 a.m. in Johannesburg. It
traded at 6.978 before the data was released. The 13.5 percent
government bond due 2015 climbed, lowering the yield by six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.52 percent. The
yield was at 7.54 percent before the release.  Producer inflation slowed to an annual 6.6 percent in April
from 7.3 percent a month earlier, the statistics office in
Pretoria said today. That was less than the 7 percent median
estimate of 12 analysts polled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
