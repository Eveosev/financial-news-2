Following is the technical note of
the Gross Domestic Product from the Commerce Department.  This technical note provides background information about the source data
and estimating methods used to produce the estimates presented in the GDP
news release.  The complete set of estimates for the first quarter is
available on BEA's Web site at www.bea.gov; a brief summary of "highlights"
is also posted on the Web site.  In a few weeks, the estimates will be
published in BEA's monthly journal, the Survey of
Current Business, along with a more detailed analysis of the estimates
("GDP and the Economy").  Sources of Revision to Real GDP  Real GDP increased 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 2011, which was the
same increase as in last month's Advance estimate.  Upward revisions to
exports, to inventory investment, and to nonresidential fixed investment
were offset by an upward revision to imports and a downward revision to
 consumer spending .  *       The upward revisions to both exports and imports reflected newly
available Census Bureau goods data for March and revised data for February.
*       The upward revision to inventory investment reflected newly
available Census inventory data for March for manufacturing, wholesale
trade, and retail trade industries.
*       The upward revision to nonresidential fixed investment reflected an
upward revision to nonresidential structures that was based on newly
available Census construction spending data for March and revised data for
January and February.
*       Consumer spending was revised down, reflecting downward revisions
to both goods and services. Within goods, the largest revision was to motor
vehicle fuels, lubricants, and fluids, based on newly available data from
the Energy Information Administration (EIA) for February.  Within services,
the largest revision was to electricity and gas services, based on newly
available usage and unit value data from EIA.  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases increased 3.8 percent in the
first quarter, the same increase as in the advance estimate.  Revisions to Wages and Salaries and Disposable Personal Income  In addition to presenting revised estimates for the first quarter, today's
release also presents revised estimates of fourth-quarter wages and
salaries, personal taxes, and contributions for government social
insurance.  Wage and
salary disbursements are now estimated to have increased $27.9 billion in
the fourth quarter of 2010, a downward revision of $24.6 billion.  These
estimates reflect newly available wage and salary tabulations for the
fourth
quarter from the BLS quarterly census of employment and wages (QCEW).
These data are more comprehensive than the monthly employment and earnings
data that were used for the earlier estimates√πthe QCEW data include
irregular pay,
such as bonuses and gains from the exercise of  stock options .  Real disposable personal income (DPI) is now estimated to have increased
1.1 percent in the fourth quarter and 0.8 percent in the first.  (By
comparison, the estimates that were available last month showed increases
of 1.9 percent
in the fourth quarter and 2.9 percent in the first.)  The downward revision
to first quarter real DPI reflected an upward revision to personal current
taxes and a downward revision to personal income.  The upward revision to
personal current taxes reflects the incorporation of monthly federal tax
collections data through April from the Monthly Treasury Statement and
daily collections data through mid-May from the Daily Treasury Statement.
The
largest contributor to the downward revision to personal income was a
revision to government social benefits to persons, specifically to Medicaid
benefits.  Annual Revision Scheduled for July 29  The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs)
will be released along with the ``advance estimate of GDP for the second
quarter of 2011 on July 29.  In addition to the regular revision of
estimates for the
most recent 3 years and the first quarter of 2011, GDP and some components
will be revised back to the first quarter of 2003 (see "Preview of the
Upcoming Annual NIPA Revision" in the May Survey of Current Business).  The
August Survey
will contain an article that describes the annual revision in detail.  Table A.--SOURCE DATA FOR THE ADVANCE AND SECOND  ESTIMATES OF GDP FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011  This table shows the actual data used for the second estimate of GDP for
the first quarter of 2011.  For these key series, actual data for March
were not available in time for inclusion in the advance GDP estimate
released on April 28, 2011, and BEA made assumptions for these source data.
The numbers in brackets show the March values that had been assumed for the
advance estimate.  For most series, the data incorporated for February and,
in some cases, for January, were preliminary, and the numbers shown in
brackets are the values used last month.  All series shown in the table are in billions of dollars, seasonally
adjusted at annual rates, and are published by the Bureau of the Census.  2010  Oct.      Nov.      Dec.  Private fixed investment:  Nonresidential structures:
