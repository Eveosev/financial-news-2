The rand advanced the most in more
than a week against the dollar as speculation  China  may raise
purchases of European bonds eased concern the sovereign-debt
crisis will spread, boosting demand for risky assets.  The rand strengthened as much as 0.9 percent to 6.9622 per
dollar, the biggest intraday gain since May 18. It traded 0.5
percent stronger at 6.9901 as of 5:33 p.m. in Johannesburg. It
appreciated 0.4 percent to 9.8707 per euro.  The euro rallied against the dollar after a report that
China may buy Portuguese bailout bonds when the European
Financial Stability Facility sells them in June.  South Africa ’s
benchmark stock index gained for a third day, and the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index rose the most since since April 20.  “The main story this morning is the mild euro recovery, a
result of China showing interest in Portuguese debt,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in a research note. “We
should expect some further dollar downside from the start.”  The rand pared its gain against the dollar, following the
euro weaker, after Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads
the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the  International
Monetary Fund  may not release its portion of aid to  Greece  next
month. The rand often tracks the euro, the currency of most of
South Africa’s trade.  South African  government bonds  advanced, driving yields to
four-month lows, after producer-price inflation slowed more than
economists’ expectations, and growth and jobs data from the U.S.
added to signs a recovery in the world’s biggest economy may be
losing pace.  PPI Data  The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 27 cents to 121.59
rand, reducing the yield seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 7.51 percent, the lowest on a closing basis since Jan.
13. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 34 cents to
89.68 rand, driving the yield down five basis points to 8.31
percent, the lowest since Jan. 12.  “We’ve had a stronger rand, and the numbers out of the
U.S. are not great,” Deon van Zyl, who oversees about 13
billion rand ($1.9 billion) of debt as head of fixed-interest
investments at Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset Managers, said
by phone. “Bonds are also better on the back of the PPI data.”  Producer prices increased an annual 6.6 percent after
gaining 7.3 percent in March, Pretoria-based Statistics South
Africa said on its website today. The median estimate of 12
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7 percent. Prices advanced
0.9 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
