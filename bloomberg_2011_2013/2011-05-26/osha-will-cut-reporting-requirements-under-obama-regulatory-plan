The  Occupational Safety and Health
Administration  plans to cut more than 1.9 million hours of
annual reporting requirement for business, a step the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce said would have little effect on companies.  The OSHA rule would save more than $40 million a year, Cass Sunstein, director of the White House Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs, said today in outlining a government-wide
overhaul.  “The specific changes they are making will generate
negligible changes at best,” said Marc Freedman, executive
director of labor law policy at the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce ,
the nation’s largest business lobbying group.  The agency also plans to let companies apply the same
hazard labels on household or workplace chemicals, such as
cleaning products, used in other nations, which may save more
than $585 million a year.  Easing the rules will free manufacturers from having to
make safety labels for both the U.S. and international markets,
Freedman said in an interview.  The revisions result from the review President  Barack Obama 
ordered on Jan. 18, saying he wanted “to remove outdated
regulations that stifle  job creation  and make our economy less
competitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
