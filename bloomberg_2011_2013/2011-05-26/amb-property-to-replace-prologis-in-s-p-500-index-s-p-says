AMB Property Corp. (AMB)  was picked to
 ProLogis (PLD)  in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index after the close of
trading on June 2, while  Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (DRC)  will take AMB
Property’s spot in the S&P MidCap 400 Index, S&P said in a
statement.  AMB is joining the benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks because
it’s acquiring ProLogis in a deal expected to be completed
around that time, S&P said, adding that after the combination
AMB will be renamed ProLogis Inc. and trade under the ticker
PLD, the current symbol for ProLogis.  Separately,  Hancock Holding Co. (HBHC)  will replace  PacWest
Bancorp (PACW)  in the S&P MidCap 400 after the close of trading on June
3, S&P said. Hancock is buying Whitney Holding Corp. around that
time, S&P said, adding that Whitney will be removed from the S&P
SmallCap 600 Index and will be replaced by  Kraton Performance
Polymers Inc. (KRA)  PacWest Bancorp will move from the midcap gauge to
the small-cap measure, S&P said.  San Francisco-based AMB Property, which buys and operates
industrial properties in the U.S., has a market value of $6.13
billion. The shares have risen 47 percent in the past year,
compared with a 42 percent gain for a Bloomberg index of
warehouse and industrial real-estate investment trusts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
