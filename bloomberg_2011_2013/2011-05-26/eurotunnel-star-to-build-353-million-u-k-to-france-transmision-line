Groupe Eurotunnel SA (GET) , which operates
the rail tunnels below the  English Channel , formed a joint
venture with Star Capital Partners Ltd. to build a power
transmission line between the U.K. and France.  The cable, to be installed in the service tunnel, will
require about 250 million euros ($353 million) of investment and
have a capacity of about 500 megawatts, Eurotunnel said today in
a  statement .  Connecting the two countries’ power grids will support the
development of renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind,
by making it easier to integrate energy sources that produce
power intermittently compared with traditional coal or gas-fired
plants.  “As we change the energy mix to include power from the sun
and the wind, we expect to see increased volatility in supply
and price shocks,” Simon Ludlam, partner at Star Capital, said
in an interview by telephone. “Interconnection helps smooth out
that volatility by providing access to large pools of demand and
generation in neighboring markets.”  The line is expected to be operational by 2015, Ludlam
said.  France  is targeting 6,000 megawatts of offshore wind by
2020, from nothing now, and the U.K. plans to develop 13
gigawatts of sea-based wind farms by 2020 to help meet European
renewable-energy goals.  The link will run for 75 kilometers (47 miles) between the
two national networks and increase cross-Channel capacity by 25
percent to 2,500 megawatts, according to the statement.
Eurotunnel will own 49 percent of the joint venture and London-
based investment fund Star Capital, which has 1 billion euros
under management, will own 51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
