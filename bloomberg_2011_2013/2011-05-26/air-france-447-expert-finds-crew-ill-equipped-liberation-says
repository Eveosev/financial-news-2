A panel of court-appointed experts
found the crew of Air  France  flight 447 were ill-prepared to
cope with speed-sensor failures, Liberation  reported , citing a
March 20 investigation document. Airbus SAS procedures were
unsuited to the situation, the newspaper quoted the document as
saying.  A spokesman for Air France SA, Cedric Leurquin, declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg, as did a representative of
Airbus.  “Until the investigation is finalized, it would be
irresponsible to comment on potential contributors to the
accident,” Mary Anne Greczyn, a Herndon, Virginia-based
spokeswoman for Airbus, said in an e-mail message. The
planemaker is based in Toulouse, France.  The black-box data from the June 1, 2009, crash was not yet
available when the document was produced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
