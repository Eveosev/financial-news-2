CFC Stanbic Ltd., a Kenyan lender,
slumped to the lowest level in a year after saying first-quarter

55 shillings, at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the lowest closing
price since May 11, 2010.  Net income dropped 38 percent to 347.3 million shillings
($4 million) in the three months through March, the Nairobi-
based lender said in a statement published in the Standard
newspaper today. Operating expenses climbed 29 percent to 1.62
billion shillings, while non-interest income dipped 23 percent
