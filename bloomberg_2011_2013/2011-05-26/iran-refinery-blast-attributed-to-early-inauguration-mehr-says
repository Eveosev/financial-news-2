A blast at a refinery in southern
 Iran  that killed as many as four people and hurt about 25 was
the result of pressure by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s
government for an early inauguration of the unit,  Mehr  reported,
citing Parliamentary Speaker Ali Larijani.  The accident occurred due to an unreasonable request to
inaugurate the refinery on May 24, the state-run  news agency 
said, citing remarks by Larijani in parliament yesterday.  The blast and fire in a gasoline production unit during the
inauguration attended by Ahmadinejad was attributed to gas
leakage. The government wanted to open the unit at Abadan in
southwestern Khuzestan province to coincide with the anniversary
of Iran’s liberation of Khorramshahr, another city in the
province, Mehr reported. Khorramshahr was captured by Iraqi
forces during the 1980’s war between the two countries.  Experts had conducted tests and warned about the
possibility of an accident, Ali Mousavi, a parliamentary deputy
representing the city of Abadan, said on May 24, Mehr reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
