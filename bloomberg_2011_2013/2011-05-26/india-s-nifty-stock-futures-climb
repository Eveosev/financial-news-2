India’s stock-index futures rose,
signaling a gain for benchmark indexes, after earnings reports
by  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  and  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  eased concern higher
 interest rates  will curb profit growth.  SGX S&P CNX Nifty Index futures for May delivery rose 0.2
percent to 5,360 at 10:18 a.m. in  Singapore . The futures are
derived from the 50 stocks on the underlying S&P CNX Nifty Index
on the National Stock Exchange, which slid 0.9 percent to
5,348.95 yesterday. The benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index lost 0.9 percent to 17,847.24.  Tata Steel, the nation’s biggest producer of the alloy, may
climb after posting a 72 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit
to $937 million, aided by rising prices and the sale of a unit
in the U.K. Coal  India , the world’s biggest producer of the fuel,
announced net income of 42.2 billion rupees and sales of 150.2
billion rupees in the three months ended March 31, without
giving year-earlier figures.  “Tata Steel’s numbers have been good and they are likely
to ease some investor concerns,” said Kishor Ostwal, managing
director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., a publicly traded
equities research provider in Mumbai. “The stock valuations are
attractive. The fall has been excessive. The ongoing concerns
like inflation and interest rates continue, but they are getting
priced in due to the recent declines.”  The Sensex has slid 13 percent this year on concern higher
borrowing costs will hurt corporate profits. Stocks on the gauge
are valued at an average 14.3 times estimated profit, down from
21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index trades at 10.9 times earnings.  `Too Cautious'  Citigroup Inc. is positive on Indian stocks as earnings
growth is “pretty stable” after stripping out  State Bank  of
India’s profit plunge, analysts including Aditya Narain said in
a report dated yesterday. Fourth-quarter earnings for Sensex
companies that have reported are exceeding analyst estimates,
Citigroup said, reiterating its prediction for 18 percent to 19
percent profit growth for fiscal 2012.  “The market is probably too cautious on the impact on
growth and earnings,” Citigroup said in a report.  Overseas investors bought a net 351 million rupees ($7.77
million) of Indian stocks on May 24, paring their outflows from
equities this year to 30.8 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  Beating Estimates  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , the energy explorer that Vedanta
Resources Plc plans to acquire, may advance after posting a 10-
fold increase in fourth-quarter profit to a record 24.6 billion
rupees ($543 million), beating analyst estimates after crude oil
production and prices rose. The average profit estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 23 billion rupees.  India’s central bank on May 3 raised rates for a ninth time
since March 2010 to curb rising prices, and Governor Duvvuri Subbarao predicted inflation will stay “elevated” until
September. Wholesale-price inflation quickened to 8.98 percent
in March, beating the central bank’s 8 percent estimate.  The commerce ministry will report food inflation data for
the week ended May 14 on May 26. The wholesale index rose 7.47
percent in the week to May 7 from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
