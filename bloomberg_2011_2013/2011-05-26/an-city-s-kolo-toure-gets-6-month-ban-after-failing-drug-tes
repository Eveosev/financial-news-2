Manchester City ’s Kolo Toure was
given a six-month ban after failing a drug test, the Football
Association said on its website. The suspension was backdated
to March 2, which was when Toure was provisionally suspended.  The Ivory Coast defender, who tested positive for an
unidentified “specified substance,” joined City from Arsenal
in July 2009.  In a  statement  on its website, the F.A. said an independent
regulatory commission found that the substance entered Toure’s
body through water tablets obtained through his wife.  It was found he did not intend to enhance sporting
performance or to mask the use of a performance-enhancing
substance.  The minimum period of two years suspension was reduced
because of the player’s degree of fault, the F.A. said.  “The player accepted he was at fault and with that
concession we agree,” the commission said. “He was at fault in
the limited and perfunctory efforts he made in relation to the
water tablets; the checks he made in relation to those tablets
were inadequate and fell some way below what it would be
reasonable to expect of a professional footballer in these
circumstances.”  Toure will be “target-tested” for a period of two years
from today, the F.A. said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
