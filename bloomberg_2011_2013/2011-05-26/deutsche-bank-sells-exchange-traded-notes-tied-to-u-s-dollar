Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  issued two exchange-
traded notes that track the bank’s  U.S. Dollar  Long Future
Index, a gauge reflecting the value of the dollar compared with
six major currencies.  The first ETN, under ticker UUPT, yields three times any
gains or declines in the index, according to a prospectus filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The second note,
under ticker UDNT, allows the buyer to bet against the index and
returns three times the amount of any declines in the measure.
UDNT holders stand to lose as much as three times any gains in
the underlying index, which has lost more than 15 percent since
June 2010. The notes began trading May 24 on NYSE Arca.  Deutsche Bank has a market capitalization of $1.1 billion
in ETNs in the U.S., the third-highest among banks, behind
Barclay Bank Plc at $9.36 billion and at JPMorgan Chase & Co.
$2.69 billion.  Exchange-traded notes are unsecured debt whose value is
generally designed to mirror the performance of an index. They
are backed only by their issuer’s credit, unlike exchange-traded
funds, which hold assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
