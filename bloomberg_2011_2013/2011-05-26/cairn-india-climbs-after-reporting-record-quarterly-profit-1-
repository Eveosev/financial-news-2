Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , the energy explorer
that  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  plans to acquire, gained the most in
more than a month in Mumbai trading after reporting a record
quarterly profit that beat analyst estimates.  The shares rose as much as 4.1 percent to 351.85 rupees,
the biggest increase since April 4, and were at 346.70 rupees at
9:22 a.m. local time. The stock advanced 3.6 percent this year
compared with a 13 percent decline in the benchmark Sensitive
Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange.  Net income jumped 10-fold from a year earlier to 24.6
billion rupees ($543 million) in the three months ended March 31
after New York crude averaged 20 percent higher in the quarter.
The mean profit estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was 23 billion rupees.  “Profit will continue to grow in the coming quarters
because of  oil prices ,” said Deepak Darisi, a Mumbai-based
analyst with LKP Shares & Securities Ltd., which advises
investors to buy the stock. Darisi has a share price target of
392 rupees.  The previous quarterly record was the three months ended
Dec. 31 when the company based in Gurgaon, near  New Delhi ,
reported net income of 20.1 billion rupees.  The unit of U.K.-based  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  expects its three
oilfields in Rajasthan state,  India ’s largest onshore block, to
yield 240,000 barrels a day. The output rate depends on
government approval. Cairn India is currently producing 125,000
barrels a day from one field.  Increasing Production  Production started at the Mangala field in Rajasthan in
August 2009 and the oil is sold to customers including Indian
Oil Corp. and  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  The explorer is awaiting
approval from a panel, which includes representatives from the
regulator and the government, to boost production to 150,000
barrels a day.  The parent company plans to sell a 40 percent stake in
Cairn India to billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources and
is awaiting approval from India’s government. Vedanta will pay
$9.4 billion to acquire a majority holding in Cairn India,
including 8.1 percent from investors in an open offer and a 10.4
percent stake from Petronas International Corp., owned by
Malaysian state oil company Petroliam Nasional Bhd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
