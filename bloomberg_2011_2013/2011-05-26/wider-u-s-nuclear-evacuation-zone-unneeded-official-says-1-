The U.S. shouldn’t widen the minimum
evacuation zone around nuclear plants to 50 miles from 10 miles,
said George Apostolakis, a member of the  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.   It’s “unreasonable” to require the wider zone just
because U.S. citizens were urged to stay 50 miles (80
kilometers) from a nuclear plant damaged by an earthquake and
tsunami in  Japan , Apostolakis said today at a conference in
Washington.  U.S. officials made a decision on the evacuation zone in
Japan based on incomplete information, he said. It is “wrong to
say that because of that we should make sure we can evacuate
everybody within 50 miles of a nuclear plant in the  United
States ” immediately after an accident, he said.  The nation’s 104 commercial nuclear reactors are getting
closer scrutiny after a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wrecked
Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant. The double
disaster triggered fires, explosions and radiation leaks at the
plant in the world’s worst nuclear incident since the 1986
Chernobyl meltdown.  After the crisis began, the NRC started a review to
determine whether tougher regulations are needed for U.S.
reactors.  The 10-mile “emergency planning zone” around U.S. nuclear
plants can be expanded during an accident if the situation
worsens, Apostolakis said.  “We can make that 20, 30, 50 miles as appropriate,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
