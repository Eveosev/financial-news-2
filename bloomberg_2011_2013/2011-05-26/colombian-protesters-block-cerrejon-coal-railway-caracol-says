Colombian protesters have blocked a
railway carrying coal to a Caribbean port from Cerrejon, a coal-
mining venture owned by  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL) , broadcaster  Radio Caracol  said.  Residents of the northern Colombian province of La Guajira,
where the mine is located, are protesting government plans to
change the nationâ€™s distribution of royalties from commodities
products, Caracol said on its website, citing Manuel Sierra, one
of the organizers of the demonstration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
