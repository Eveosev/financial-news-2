(Corrects to say transfer of African assets rather than
Nigerian units in first paragraph of story published on May 26.)  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) ’s shareholders
approved the transfer of the African assets of Dangote
Industries Ltd. to the company at their annual general meeting
today in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, the maker of the building
material said in an e-mailed statement.  The unified company, Dangote Cement, will operate in 13
African countries in addition to Nigeria, running plants and
import terminals, according to the statement.  “We believe that this will ultimately boost the company’s
profitability and enhance  shareholder value ,” Chairman Aliko
Dangote, was quoted as saying in the statement.  The approval follows the merger of the assets of Dangote
Group’s local subsidiaries, Benue Cement Co. and Obajana Cement
with Dangote Cement, which listed 15.5 billion shares on the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  last year, to become the country’s
biggest company by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
