The Interior Department will review
rules regarding oil royalties, U.S. offshore drilling safety and
commercial filming on public lands as a part of President Barack
Obama’s plan to scrap unnecessary regulations.  The department also plans to revise fish and wildlife
service policies, obsolete land classification and Bureau of
Indian Affairs leasing regulations. Many of the department’s
plans have been previously announced.  Obama on Jan. 18 ordered a government review of rules,
saying he wanted “to remove outdated regulations that stifle
 job creation  and make our economy less competitive.”  The White House said today that 30 U.S. agencies are
seeking to repeal or modify rules in a bid to save billions of
dollars in compliance costs paid by businesses and individuals.  Interior’s review will take as long as two years, according
to a  report  posted by the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
