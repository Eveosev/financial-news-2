Stocks rose and bond yields fell for
a second day as reports  China  may buy European debt eased
concern the region’s credit crisis will deepen, offsetting data
that cast doubt on the pace of the U.S. economic recovery.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  of shares rose 0.2 percent
to 63,755.35 at the 5:30 p.m. close. Yields on two year
benchmark bonds fell 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
8.90 percent, the lowest in a week.  European Financial Stability Facility Chief Executive
Officer Klaus Regling said Asian investors, including China, may
buy Portuguese bailout bonds when the EFSF begins selling them
in June, the Financial Times reported. Stocks pared gains after
data showed U.S. gross domestic product trailed economists’
forecasts, and jobless claims unexpectedly rose.  “ Europe  opened positively on reports that China would buy
European bonds and Turkey is rising on this positive movement,”
Suha Yaygin, deputy chief of emerging markets at Toronto-
Dominion Bank in  London , wrote in e-mailed comments.  The European Union  buys  48.3 percent of Turkish exports,
the statistics institute data in March showed.  The lira was little unchanged at 1.6068 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
