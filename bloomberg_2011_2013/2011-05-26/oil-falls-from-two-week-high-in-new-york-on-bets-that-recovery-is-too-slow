Oil dropped from a two-week high on
speculation that the earlier price increase wasn’t supported by
the pace of economic recovery.  Futures reached their highest price since May 11 earlier
today after a U.S. Energy Department report yesterday showed
that diesel and heating oil supplies fell to their lowest levels
since April 2009. Inventories of gasoline increased by the most
since February. U.S. government reports today showed that gross
domestic product increased less than forecast in the first
quarter and initial jobless claims unexpectedly rose last week.  “In the last weeks we’ve seen macroeconomic data worse
than expected,” said Gerrit Zambo, a trader at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “The oil demand-supply situation is
relaxed, and there’s no danger of any shortage.”  Crude for July delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
fell as much as 84 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $100.48 a barrel
and was at $101.08 at 1:42 p.m.  London  time.  Brent crude  for
July settlement was at $114.75 a barrel after falling as much as
83 cents to $114.10 on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. The contract yesterday climbed $2.40, or 2.1 percent, to
$114.93, the highest settlement since May 10.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, the Commerce Department said today, less than the
2.2 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey, reflecting a smaller
gain in  consumer spending  than previously calculated. Jobless
claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 in the week ended May 21,
the Labor Department said. The median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey called for a drop to 404,000.  Gasoline Stockpiles Grow  U.S. gasoline stockpiles increased 3.79 million barrels to
209.7 million, the biggest addition since February, the Energy
Department said yesterday. They were forecast to rise 450,000
barrels, based on the median of 14 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline use dropped 0.3 percent to 9.03
million barrels a day.  Crude oil supplies gained 616,000 barrels to 370.9
million. Stockpiles were forecast to decrease by 1.5 million
barrels, according to the survey.  Distillate consumption was the highest since the week ended
April 15, according to the Energy Department. Total fuel demand
climbed 2.2 percent to 18.9 million barrels a day. Refineries
operated at 86.3 percent of capacity, the most since Jan. 7.  Fibonacci Support  Oil in  New York , heading for the first monthly decline
since August, has rebounded from its Fibonacci support near $95
a barrel, a level based on weekly price swings over the past
year, according to Stephanie Aymes, a cross-commodity technical
analyst at Societe Generale SA. Crude will probably continue to
trade “sideways” in coming weeks before climbing to $106, the
next Fibonacci retracement level, she said.  Brent crude, the European benchmark contract, traded at a
premium of $13.68 a barrel to U.S. futures, compared with $13.61
yesterday. The difference between front-month contracts in
London and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21. It
averaged 76 cents last year.  Brent has advanced 21 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
 Egypt  and spread to Libya, Iran and  Syria . Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh said fighting could drag the country into civil
war and warned that those who seek to disrupt security would be
met with force.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
leave production quotas unchanged at its June 8 meeting in
Vienna because there is enough oil to meet demand,  Iraq ’s Deputy
Prime Minister Hussain al-Shahristani said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
