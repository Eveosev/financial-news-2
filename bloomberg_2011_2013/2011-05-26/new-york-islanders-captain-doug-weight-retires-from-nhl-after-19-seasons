(Corrects year Carolina won  Stanley Cup  to 2006 in third
paragraph.)  Doug Weight retired after 19 seasons
in the  National Hockey League , ending his career as captain of
the New York Islanders.  Weight, 40, made the announcement today during a press

he was limited to 18 games by a back injury.  A four-time All-Star, Weight also played for the  New York
Rangers , who drafted him in the second round in 1990. He was
traded to the Edmonton Oilers for Esa Tikkanen in 1993, and went
on to play for the St. Louis Blues, Carolina Hurricanes and
Anaheim Ducks, winning a Stanley Cup title with Carolina in
2006.  In 1,225 regular-season games, Weight had 285 goals and 748
assists, while adding 23 goals and 49 assists in 97 playoff
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
