CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures exchange, signed separate memoranda of understanding
with Ukraine’s government and central bank to consider futures
on grain and non-agricultural products in the country.  A separate memorandum was signed with the Ukrainian Futures
Exchange, Chicago-based CME Group said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The parties “will study possibilities to open Black Sea
grain market on the territory of Ukraine,” Agriculture Minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said today at a grain conference in Kiev.
The potential agreement will provide financial instruments to
fund farms and help increase grain production, he said, adding
that Ukraine has the potential to harvest as much as 80 million
metric tons of grain by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
