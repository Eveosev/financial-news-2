Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) , the
maker of chips for personal computers and mobile phones, rose as
much as 11 percent in extended trading after projecting higher
quarterly sales than analysts had estimated.  Revenue will be $870 million to $910 million this quarter,
Clyde Hosein, the  Santa Clara , California-based company’s chief
financial officer, said on a conference call today. Analysts had
estimated $875.2 million, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The outlook may help allay concerns that the PC market is
in a slump, crimping demand for parts. Marvell’s chips go into
hard-disk drives, as well as the BlackBerry phone. The company
is trying to accelerate growth by landing more customers in the
smartphone and tablet markets.  Marvell rose as much as $1.56 to $16.12 in extended trading
following the report. The stock, which has declined 22 percent
this year, closed at $14.56 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  The company projected second-quarter profit of 35 cents to
39 cents, excluding certain items. Analysts had estimated a
profit of 33 cents a share in the period, which ends in July.  Last quarter, the company had net income of $146.9 million,
or 22 cents a share, compared with $205.8 million, or 30 cents,
a year earlier. Sales fell 6.2 percent to $802.4 million in the
period, which ended April 30.  The PC industry’s shipments unexpectedly dropped 3.2
percent last quarter, research firm IDC reported in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
