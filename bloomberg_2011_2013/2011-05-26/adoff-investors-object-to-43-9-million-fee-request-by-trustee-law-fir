A lawyer who said she represents 800
Bernard L. Madoff investors told a  Manhattan  judge they objected
to a $43.9 million fee request by trustee Irving Picard and his
 law firm , Baker & Hostetler LLP.  The charges for Oct. 1 through Jan. 31 work out to $5,803
daily for the trustee, who is liquidating the confidence man’s
investment firm, and $351,033 daily for his law firm, including
weekends and holidays, lawyer Helen Chaitman said yesterday in a
court filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  New York .  The fees would bring total compensation for the trustee and
his firm to $179.8 million since the  Ponzi scheme  operator’s
2008 arrest, Chaitman said in the filing.  Picard’s personal share of the $179.8 million would be
$4.3 million, according to court filings. His contract with
Baker & Hostetler might entitle him to a third or more of the
total compensation from the Madoff case, Chaitman said.  “If I’m a lawyer and I originate business, I can get
35 percent of what I originate,” Chaitman said in a phone
interview. “If I have clout, I can get 50 percent of what I
bring in.”  A Picard spokeswoman, Amanda Remus, said by e-mail, “Ms.
Chaitman’s filing contains numerous factual inaccuracies, which
the trustee’s counsel will address fully in court.” She didn’t
specify the errors.  Picard told a judge at a 2009 fee hearing that he would
turn over his compensation to his firm, according to Chaitman’s
filing.  Trustee’s Lawsuits  Picard has sued innocent investors and delayed distribution
of funds to others, Chaitman said. The trustee has started more
than 1,000 lawsuits to recoup money for Madoff investors,
including cases against customers who took what he calls
fictitious profits from the Ponzi scheme.  A hearing on the fee application is set for June 1.  The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
