TNT Express NV,  Europe ’s second-
largest express-delivery service, started trading in Amsterdam
after TNT NV shareholders approved the unit’s spinoff.  TNT Express opened at 8.90 euros and traded at 9.36 euros
as of 11:41 a.m. local time. PostNL NV, Dutch mail carrier TNT’s
new name, fell 2.6 percent, adjusted for the effect of the
spinoff, to 7.50 euros. That gave the two companies a combined
market value of 7.92 billion euros ($11.2 billion), compared
with 6.31 billion euros for TNT yesterday.  TNT shareholders yesterday approved the spinoff of the
express business, which competes with larger rival DHL, a
division of Deutsche Post AG. Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based
PostNL will retain 29.9 percent of TNT Express, which is led by
Marie-Christine Lombard. It has pledged to keep the holding for
at least six months unless the new company’s board receives and
agrees to a takeover offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
