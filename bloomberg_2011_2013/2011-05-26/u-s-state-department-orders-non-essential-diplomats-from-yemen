The U.S. State Department yesterday
ordered non-essential diplomats to leave Yemen as security
deteriorated in the capital of Sana’a and President Ali Abdullah Saleh continued to cling to power.  The department also ordered family members of American
government employees to leave and urged private citizens to do
so as well, citing “violent clashes” that “may escalate without
notice” in Sana’a.  “There is ongoing civil unrest throughout the country and
large-scale protests in major cities,” the department said.  Fighting in the streets of Sana’a continued for a third day
yesterday as Saleh warned that the clashes between security
forces and members of the Hashid tribe could drag the country
into civil war. In remarks in  London  yesterday, President  Barack Obama  again called on Saleh “to move immediately on his
commitment to transfer power.”  The most recent plan for a transfer of power, brokered by
Gulf nations and backed by the U.S. and the European Union,
collapsed May 22 when Saleh refused to sign the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
