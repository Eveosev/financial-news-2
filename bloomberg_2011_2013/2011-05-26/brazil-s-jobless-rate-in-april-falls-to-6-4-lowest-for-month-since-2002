Brazil ’s unemployment rate fell in
April to the lowest level on record for the month, keeping
pressure on policy makers trying to cool demand fueled by full-
employment conditions.  Joblessness in April fell to 6.4 percent from 6.5 percent
in March, the national statistics agency said today in Rio de
Janeiro, matching the median forecast of 31 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Low unemployment is stoking consumer demand and adding to
skepticism that policy makers in  Latin America ’s biggest economy
will succeed in cooling inflation to the 4.5 percent mid-point
of the government’s target range by 2012. Consumer prices rose
6.51 percent through mid-May, above the upper limit of the
annual range for the first time since 2005.  “You can see that the labor market is very heated,”
 Roberto Padovani , chief economist at Banco WestLB do Brasil SA,
said in an interview from Sao Paulo. Unemployment is running
below its natural rate of 6.5 percent, which is generating
inflationary pressure, he added.  Brazil generated 272,225 registered jobs in April, the
second-most since September and up from a revised 102,758 jobs
created in March. Brazil will create 3 million jobs this year,
Labor Minister Carlos Lupi said May 17.  The fastest economic growth in two decades last year and
rising salaries is prompting financial and retail companies to
expand and hire more workers in Brazil.  Banks, Wal-Mart  The Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp.’s local unit aims to
boost staffing by more than 20 percent in 2011, while Zurich-
based UBS AG plans to more than double its workforce in Brazil
to 550 people by year-end 2012.   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the
world’s largest retailer, plans to invest 1.2 billion reais
($737 million) in Brazil this year and hire 7,000 people.  Even though the labor market remains tight, a slowdown in
wage growth may help the central bank, said Gustavo Rangel,
chief Brazil economist for ING Financial Markets in New York.
Average real wages fell 1.8 percent in April from March, to
1,540 reais ($949) per month.  “This bodes well for the bank’s outlook for less demand
pressure,” Rangel said in a telephone interview from New York.
“Salaries and credit are the two main drivers for demand.”  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell 2 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.57 percent at 10:15 a.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 0.3 percent to 1.6237 per
 U.S. dollar .  Inflation Fight  To slow inflation, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration is relying on a mix of higher  interest rates ,
spending cuts and measures to curb credit growth to cool the
economy. Policy makers will push the overnight Selic rate up 50
basis points to 12.50 percent by year end, according to a
central bank survey of about 100 economists published May 23.  Padovani forecasts that policy makers will raise borrowing
costs by 0.25 percentage point at their June and July meetings,
then hold the rate at 12.5 percent for 18 months.  Economists surveyed by the central bank raised their 2012
inflation forecast to 5.1 percent, from 5 percent, according to
the median forecast in a central bank survey of about 100
economists published May 23.  Labor Market  Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s director for economic
policy, last week said that Brazil’s labor market is tight, with
parts of the country at full employment for the first time in
decades.  The economy will need to slow more for inflation to cool to
4.5 percent next year, Hamilton said.  Unemployment fell to the lowest for the month of April
since the statistics agency changed its methodology and began
tracking joblessness in Brazil’s six-biggest metropolitan areas
in 2002. In April 2010, the rate stood at 7.3 percent.  While the government has pledged to freeze hiring as part
of its austerity drive, Rousseff is pushing policies that aim to
create manufacturing jobs such as possibly purchasing tablet
computers for public schools.  Foxconn Technology Group, the world’s largest contract
manufacturer of electronics, may invest $12 billion to build a
factory in Brazil over five to six years, Rousseff said during a
visit to  China  in April. The factory could create 100,000 jobs,
Science and Technology Minister Aloizio Mercadante said.  The government may scrap a 20 percent payroll tax to help
boost  job creation , replacing it with a  sales tax  that would
vary by industry, said Congressman Paulinho da Forca.  Paulinho, who discussed the tax proposal with Finance
Minister Guido Mantega yesterday, is also head of the nation’s
second-biggest union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
