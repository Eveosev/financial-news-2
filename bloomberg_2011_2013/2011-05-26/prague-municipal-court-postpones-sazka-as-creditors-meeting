The Prague Municipal Court postponed
a meeting of creditors for Sazka AS until tomorrow at 9 a.m.,
the court’s spokeswoman Martina Lhotakova said.  The court continues today to assess the validity of
individual claims from creditors in order to state their  voting
rights  before the meeting, Lhotakova said.  Prague Municipal Court initiated bankruptcy proceedings
against Sazka AS in March. The creditors will vote during the
session today whether to reorganize the company’s business or
decree bankruptcy. The company was declared insolvent after it
breached covenants on bonds issued to finance building O2
Arena, which hosted the World Hockey Championship in 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
