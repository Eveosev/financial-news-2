Befimmo SCA,  Belgium ’s second-biggest
real-estate investment fund, said fiscal first-half earnings
before property valuation losses and changes in the value of
derivatives rose 33 percent on gains from disposals.  Earnings for the six months that ended March 31 rose to
3.13 euros a share from 2.35 euros a share a year earlier, the
Brussels-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. The
sale of the Empress Court office in Brussels and the so-called
Kattendijkdok building in Antwerp boosted per-share earnings by
about 85 cents.  Net asset value increased to 60.07 euros a share from 57.88
euros at the end of December as the fair value of interest-rate
derivatives used to hedge its debt increased by 17.4 million
euros over a six-month period and property valuation losses
slowed to 0.29 percent of their combined market value in the
second quarter. Befimmo maintained its forecast for a gross
dividend of 3.94 euros over the 12 months through September.  Befimmo will ask shareholders’ approval on June 8 to align
its fiscal year with the calendar year and said May 6 it plans
to distribute a final dividend of 99 cents a share over the
three months through December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
