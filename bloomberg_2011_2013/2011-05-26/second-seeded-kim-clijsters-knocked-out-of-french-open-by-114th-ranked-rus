Second-seeded  Kim Clijsters  was upset
by Arantxa Rus of the Netherlands in the second round of the
French Open in Paris.  Rafael Nadal ,  Maria Sharapova  and  Andy Murray  all advanced.  Rus, ranked 114th in the world, reached the third round of
a Grand Slam tennis tournament for the first time with the 3-6,
7-5, 6-1 victory. She fought off two match points in the second
set and won 11 of the final 12 games on a windy day at Roland
Garros.  “This is for sure my biggest win,” the 20-year-old said
in a news conference. “It was really nice to play against her.
She’s a real hero.”  Sharapova was two games from defeat before coming back to
beat French teenager Caroline Garcia 3-6, 6-4, 6-0. The seventh-
seeded Russian won the final 11 games of the match.  Nadal, the top seed who is seeking his record-tying sixth
 French Open  championship, beat fellow Spaniard Pablo Andujar 7-
5, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) to join No. 4 Murray of Britain and No. 5
Robin Soderling of Sweden in the third round. Murray beat
Italy’s Simone Bolelli 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 7-5, and Soderling
defeated Albert Ramos of Spain 6-3, 6-4, 6-4.  Clijsters was up a set and 5-2 in the second when she
failed to convert her first match point. Rus then won five
straight games, saving another match point, to force the
decisive set.  After Clijsters took the opening game of the third set, Rus
won the next six to close out the match. Clijsters, a four-time
major champion who’s never won a title at  Roland Garros , made 65
unforced errors, compared to 22 for Rus.  Sharapova Comeback  Sharapova was down a set and 4-1 against Garcia, a 17-year-
old ranked 188th in the world. The three-time Grand Slam
champion then broke Garcia’s serve three times to take the
second set and dominated the third as Garcia made 13 unforced
errors.  “I was just trying to stay in the match,” Sharapova said
in a courtside interview. “The conditions were tough, but I
turned it around.”  Nadal battled for more than three hours to improve his
record at the French Open to 40-1. He trailed 1-5 in the third
set before fighting off eight set points to force a tiebreaker.  Nadal took a 5-1 lead in the tiebreaker before Andujar won
three straight points. Andujar then dumped a drop shot into the
net and Nadal won the next point to end the match.  Murray Wins  Murray needed almost three hours to defeat the 126th-ranked
Bolelli, who led 5-3 in the third set before dropping the final
four games.  “I was really, really happy to come through today,”
Murray told reporters. “It was a match that I would have been
expected to win and it was a very tough one.”  Soderling won the first two sets from Ramos and broke for a
4-3 lead in the third. After dropping the next game on serve, he
broke serve again and served out the match.  Mardy Fish, the 10th seed from the U.S., defeated  Robin
Haase  of the Netherlands 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, 6-1. He’s the only
American man left in the field after No. 24 Sam Querrey lost to
Croatia’s Ivan Ljubicic in straight sets.  No. 15 Viktor Troicki of Serbia, No. 16 Fernando Verdasco
of Spain, No. 18 Gilles Simon of France and No. 21 Alexandr
Dolgopolov of Ukraine won, while No. 8 Jurgen Melzer of Austria,
No. 20 Florian Mayer of  Germany , No. 27 Marcos Baghdatis of
Cyprus and 28th-seeded Nikolay Davydenko all lost.  In the women’s draw, No. 4 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus,
No. 6 Li Na of  China , No. 9 Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic,
No. 12 Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, No. 15 Andrea Petkovic of
Germany, No. 16 Kaia Kanepi of Estonia, No. 21 Yanina Wickmayer
of Belgium, No. 24 Jarmila Gajdosova of  Australia , No. 25 Maria Kirilenko of  Russia  and No. 30 Roberta Vinci of  Italy  all won in
straight sets. No. 27 Alexandra Dulgheru lost to Sorana Cirstea
6-2, 7-5 in a match between Romanian players.  To contact the reporter on this story:
