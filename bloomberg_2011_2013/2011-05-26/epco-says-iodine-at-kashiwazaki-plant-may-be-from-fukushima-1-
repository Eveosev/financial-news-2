Tokyo Electric Power Co. said it
found traces of radioactive iodine 131 near its Kashiwazaki
Kariwa nuclear plant that may have originated from the utility’s
stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi reactors.  Operations at Kashiwazaki on  Japan ’s western coast are
normal, the company known as Tepco said in a statement today.
The iodine was found in seaweed that may have drifted over from
the Fukushima plant on the country’s eastern coast, according to
the statement.  Radiation leaks from the three reactor meltdowns at
Fukushima rank the accident on the same scale as the Chernobyl
disaster in 1986. The 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone
around Fukushima has forced the evacuation of 50,000 households,
extermination of livestock and disposal of crops.  Chubu Electric Power Co., which shut all the reactors at
its sole nuclear station following the Fukushima disaster,
detected radioactive cobalt 58 on a filter attached to an
exhaust stack at the plant, the utility said today.  The amount of cobalt 58 found at the Hamaoka plant in
southeast Japan wasn’t high enough to be harmful, according to
Chubu Electric.  Maintenance at the plant’s reactor No. 5 may have tainted
the filter, the company said.  During the reactor’s shutdown, about 400 metric tons of
seawater leaked into the steam condenser and 5 tons of it flowed
into the pressure vessel, Akio Miyazaki, the Tokyo-based
spokesman at the utility, said by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
