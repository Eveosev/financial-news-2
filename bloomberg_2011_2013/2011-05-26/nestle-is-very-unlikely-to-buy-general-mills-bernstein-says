Nestle SA (NESN) , the Swiss maker of KitKat
chocolate bars, is unlikely to fulfill a decade of speculation
that it may buy U.S.-based  General Mills Inc. (GIS) , according to
Sanford C. Bernstein.  Nestle has little interest in most of General Mills’s
categories and markets, and the Minneapolis-based company offers
comparatively slow revenue growth, Andrew Wood, senior research
analyst at the New York-based brokerage, said in a note today.  Bernstein estimates that only 14 percent of General Mills’s
business is “high interest” for Nestle, including Haagen-Dazs
ice cream outside North America and the company’s frozen pizza
business, which is insufficient to justify a deal. General Mills
also operates in fewer faster-growth emerging markets and its
pace of sales “would dilute Nestle’s top-line growth.”  A possible acquisition of General Mills would be
“marginally accretive” to earnings from the first year and the
Swiss company could afford to buy it, Wood said, adding that he
sees a deal as unlikely.  The brokerage rates Nestle “outperform” and General Mills
“market perform.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
