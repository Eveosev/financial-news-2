European stocks retreated as
commodities dropped and investors awaited a report that may show
the  U.S. economy  is growing faster than expected. U.S. futures
and Asian shares climbed.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  jumped 2.8 percent after the world’s largest
publicly traded hedge fund said profit fell less than estimated
and client assets increased. Nobel Biocare Holding AG, the Swiss
maker of dental implants, surged 8.1 percent after Morgan
Stanley recommended the shares. Burberry Group Plc, the U.K.’s
largest luxury retailer, dropped 3.1 percent.  The Stoxx 600 declined 0.3 percent to 276.53 at 10:17 a.m.
in London. The gauge has risen 5.5 percent from this year’s low
on March 16 amid optimism company profits and government
stimulus measures will keep the economic recovery on track.
Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
increased 0.2 percent to 1,318.7. Asia’s benchmark MSCI  Asia 
Pacific Index surged 1.5 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
