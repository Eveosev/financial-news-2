Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) , a Canadian
copper and zinc producer, abandoned a plan to sell itself,
saying the indicative bids didn’t fully value the company.  Chief Executive Officer Phil Wright will resign effective
from June 30, in accordance with a previously announced plan,
Toronto-based Lundin said yesterday in a statement. Paul Conibear, senior vice president corporate development, will
serve as interim CEO until a permanent replacement is found.  The bids “did not adequately value the company or its
assets,” Lundin said.  “The best way to create  shareholder
value  is to continue to manage and develop the company’s quality
assets and to actively seek growth opportunities.”  Lundin put itself up for sale in March while it was
combating a hostile C$4.3 billion ($4.4 billion) bid from
 Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , with Wright saying at the time its
European mines and its 25 percent stake in the Tenke Fungurume
copper and cobalt mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, may
be worth more separately. The sale process continued at Lundin
even after Equinox withdrew the offer and agreed to be taken
over by  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)   Wright said May 11 that Lundin had received “good”
interest in its Tenke stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
