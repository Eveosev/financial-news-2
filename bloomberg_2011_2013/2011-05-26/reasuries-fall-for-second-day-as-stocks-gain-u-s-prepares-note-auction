Treasury seven-year notes declined
before the government’s $29 billion auction of the securities as
global equities rose.  Benchmark 10-year notes headed for their first back-to-back
losses in two weeks before a report forecast to show the  U.S.
economy  grew faster last quarter than initially estimated.
First-time jobless claims dropped last week, separate figures
are expected to indicate.  “We’ve had some easing of the general risk aversion
environment,” said  Orlando Green , a fixed-income strategist at
Credit Agricole SA in  London . “U.S. equities saw some recovery
towards the latter part of yesterday, just after the European
close, and right now we’re still in a bit of a range.”  Yields on current seven-year notes rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.47 percent at 7:17 a.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.625
percent note maturing in April 2018 fell 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 101.  Benchmark 10-year notes yields increased one basis point to
3.14 percent after touching 3.09 percent on May 18, the lowest
level since Dec. 7.  June contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased
0.1 percent. The MSCI World Index of equities rose for a third
day, advancing 0.4 percent.  Gross domestic product grew 2.2 percent in the first
quarter following 3.1 percent expansion in the last three months
of 2010, according to the median forecast of 82 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The government initially estimated that
the economy increased 1.8 percent.  Yield Outlook  The 10-year yield will climb to 3.84 percent by year-end,
according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
financial companies, with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  Treasuries are headed for a second straight monthly rally
on concern  Europe  will struggle to contain its sovereign-debt
crisis and the U.S. economic recovery is slowing. The 10-year
yield touched a level yesterday below its 200-day moving average
for the first time since December.  U.S. debt  returned 1.2 percent last month, the most since
August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. It
has gained another 1.1 percent in May.  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of expectations for
consumer prices over the life of the debt, has narrowed to 2.32
percentage points from a three-year high of 2.66 percentage
points in April. The average over the past decade is 2.10
percentage points.  Five-Year Auction  The government sold $35 billion of five-year notes
yesterday with a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.20, the most since
1994. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought the highest proportion since September.  The seven-year debt on offer today yielded 2.50 percent in
pre-auction trading, versus 2.712 percent at the previous sale
of the securities on April 28.  Investors bid for 2.63 times the amount offered last month,
compared with an average of 2.85 for the past 10 auctions.
Indirect bidders purchased 39.1 percent of the securities,
versus the 10-sale average of 49.6 percent. Today’s sale is the
last of three note auctions this week totaling $99 billion.  The  Federal Reserve  is scheduled to purchase $5 billion to
$7 billion of Treasuries due from May 2015 to November 2016 to
spur the economy under a $600 billion program expiring in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
