European stocks retreated after a
report showed the  U.S. economy  grew slower than economists had
predicted. U.S. futures erased gains, while Asian shares rose.  Burberry Group Plc, the U.K.’s largest luxury retailer,
tumbled 4.6 percent. Man Group Plc jumped 3.1 percent after the
world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager said profit
fell less than estimated and client assets increased. Nobel
Biocare Holding AG, the world’s second biggest maker of dental
implants, surged 6.8 percent after Morgan Stanley recommended
the shares.  The Stoxx 600 lost 0.3 percent to 276.69 at 1:40 p.m. in
 London . Even so, the gauge has risen 5.6 percent from this
year’s low on March 16 as investors speculated that company
profits and government stimulus measures will keep the economic
recovery on track. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
expiring in June slid 0.1 percent to 1,315.6. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index surged 1.6 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
