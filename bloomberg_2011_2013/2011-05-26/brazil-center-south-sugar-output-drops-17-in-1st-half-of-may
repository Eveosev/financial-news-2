Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, slumped 17 percent
in the first half of May, industry association Unica said.  Output dropped to 1.55 million tons in the first half of
the month, from 1.87 million tons in the same period a year
earlier, Unica said today in an e-mailed statement.  Farmers harvested 32.8 million tons of sugar cane in the
period, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier, Unica said.
Brazil’s sugar-cane harvest usually runs from March until
December. In the harvest so far this year, growers have reaped
56.7 million tons of cane and produced 2.36 million tons of
sugar.  Ethanol production in the first half of May fell 13 percent
to 1.26 billion liters (333 million gallons). Mills in the
Center South produce about 90 percent of the country’s sugar and
ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
