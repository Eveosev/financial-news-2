The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
is looking into allegations that a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  unit
improperly denied mortgage borrowers the chance to lower
payments through a government program.  The Financial Times reported late yesterday on its website
that it received a letter from an anonymous employee of the
unit, Litton Loan Servicing LP, with the allegations.  “We are in possession of the letter and are conducting an
inquiry,”  Jack Gutt , a spokesman for the New York Fed, said in
an e-mail to Bloomberg News yesterday without elaborating.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
in March it’s trying to sell Houston-based Litton after
acquiring it more than three years ago. The unit is cooperating
with investigations by the  attorneys general  from 50 states of
the mortgage industry’s foreclosure practices, which began after
they discovered some firms used faulty or falsified paperwork to
seize homes.  Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in  New York ,
declined to comment.  The unidentified person familiar with Litton said some loan
modifications were denied because Litton employees made mistakes
in calculating the borrower’s income or on the grounds that
documents were missing, even if the computer system showed the
appropriate paperwork was received, the Financial Times
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
