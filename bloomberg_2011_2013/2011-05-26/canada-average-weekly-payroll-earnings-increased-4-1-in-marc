Average weekly earnings of non-farm
payroll employees grew 4.1 percent in March from a year earlier,
on gains in hours worked and hiring by manufacturers.  The number of employees on payrolls rose in March by about
241,000 from a year earlier to 14.85 million, a gain of 1.6
percent,  Statistics Canada  said today from Ottawa. The average
number of hours worked increased by 0.3 percent on the year.  Wage gains have been 4 percent or higher, double the Bank
of Canada’s 2 percent inflation target, for eight straight
months. Statistics Canada said May 20 that consumer prices
advanced 3.3 percent in April from a year earlier.  On a monthly basis, payrolls increased by 21,400, or 0.1
percent, in March. Average earnings rose 0.5 percent to C$876.53
($896.51), the report said.  Statistics Canada’s main employment report, the May 6 labor
force survey of households, said that 58,300 jobs were created
in April after a March decline of 1,500.  To contact the reporter on this story:
