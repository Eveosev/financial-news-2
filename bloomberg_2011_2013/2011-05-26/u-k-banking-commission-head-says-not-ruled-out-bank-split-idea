     May 26 (Bloomberg) -  John Vickers , chairman of the U.K.’s
Independent Commission on Banking, said the commission has not
ruled out a recommendation that banks should be split into
retail and investment banking.  “We have absolutely not ruled out a full split,” Vickers
told a conference in Edinburgh today. “The merit of a full
split is that if you have an international storm, then the
retail side is better protected. If it is ring-fenced, then
there is an argument it won’t give you as much protection.”  Vickers, 52, was asked by the government last year to make
recommendations to boost stability and competition in the
British banking industry after taxpayers spent 65.8 billion
pounds ($108 billion) rescuing Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
and Lloyds during the financial crisis. The ICB’s interim report
published last month recommended that the U.K.’s biggest banks
boost capital, implement plans for an orderly bankruptcy and
erect fire breaks around consumer units to boost financial-
system stability.  “A huge part of what we are trying to do is get the
taxpayer off the hook,” said Vickers. “Second time around,
these banks may be too big to save rather than too big to
fail.”  ICB panel members include  Bill Winters , co-chief executive
officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s investment bank from 2004 to
2009, and Martin Taylor, the former Barclays CEO.  Vickers and his four fellow commissioners will deliver a
final report to Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  in
September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
