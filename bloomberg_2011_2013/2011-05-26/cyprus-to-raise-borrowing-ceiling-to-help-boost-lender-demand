Cyprus plans to raise its euro
medium-term notes borrowing ceiling to 9 billion euros ($12.8
billion) from the current 6 billion euros, according to Phedon
Kalozois, economic director at the  finance ministry .  This measure may increase demand for Cypriot euro bonds as
“lenders prefer frequent issuers,” Kalozois, who is also head
of the east Mediterranean island’s public debt management
office, told reporters today in Nicosia. “We currently used up
4.72 billion euros and are not planning to use up the entire new
ceiling.”  The island may resort to international markets when market
conditions permit, with a 750 million-euro to 1 billion-euro
offering of an unspecified maturity, Kalozois said, adding that
lead managers have been selected.  Cyprus, the euro area’s third-smallest economy, may also
borrow from foreign investors through the issue of notes that
are based on the respective legislation of certain markets and
are similar to “private placement,” according to Kalozois.  To contact the reporter on this story:
