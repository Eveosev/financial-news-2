European stocks pared losses, leaving
the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index little changed, as
investors awaited a report that may show the  U.S. economy  grew
faster than expected. U.S. futures and Asian shares rose.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  jumped 3.4 percent after the world’s largest
publicly traded hedge fund manager said profit fell less than
estimated and client assets increased. Nobel Biocare Holding AG,
the Swiss maker of dental implants, surged 6.9 percent after
Morgan Stanley recommended the shares. Burberry Group Plc, the
U.K.’s largest luxury retailer, dropped 3.6 percent even after
reporting that profit rose 39 percent.  The Stoxx 600 was little changed, falling less than 0.1
percent, to 277.28 at 11:21 a.m. in  London . The gauge has risen
5.8 percent from this year’s low on March 16 as investors
speculated that company profits and government stimulus measures
will keep the economic recovery on track. Futures on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June increased 0.2
percent to 1,319.6. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index surged 1.6
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
