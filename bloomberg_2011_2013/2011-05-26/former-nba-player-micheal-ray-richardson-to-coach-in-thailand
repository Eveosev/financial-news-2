Former  New York Knicks  and New Jersey
Nets player Michael Ray Richardson has been hired to coach the
 Chang Thailand Slammers  of the country’s professional league.  Richardson, 56, is the first coach hired under
collaboration between the National Basketball Retired Players
Association and basketball consulting firm Global Coach U.S.,
according to a news release from the association.  Richardson, drafted No. 4 by the Knicks in 1978, played
eight National Basketball Association seasons, the first four
with  New York , before a stint with the  Golden State Warriors  and
three-plus seasons with the Nets.  He averaged 14.8 points and seven rebounds per game before
being banned from the league in 1986 after a third positive drug
test. He later restored his relationship with the NBA, serving
as a community ambassador.  Richardson went on to play 14 seasons in  Europe , and played
and more recently coached in the Continental Basketball
Association.  The Albany Patroons of the CBA didn’t renew his coaching
contract in 2007 following a suspension for alleged anti-gay and
anti-Semetic remarks,  according to the Associated Press .
Richardson apologized for the comments and denied that his
intent was to be derogatory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
