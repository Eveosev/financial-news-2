Hispanics in the U.S. increased four
times faster than the total population during the past decade as
residents of Mexican origin more than doubled, the Census Bureau
said.  Latino residents jumped by 15.2 million, or 43 percent, and
accounted for the majority of the nation’s 9.7 percent growth
rate from 2000 to 2010, the  federal agency  said today. The
Hispanic population grew in all 50 states and the  District of
Columbia  and now accounts for 16 percent of U.S. residents.  In 2008, Latinos voted for Barack Obama by a ratio of more
than 2-to-1, according to the nonpartisan  Pew Hispanic Center  in
Washington. The role that Hispanic  population growth  will play
in U.S. politics won’t be fully known until states finish
drawing new districts.  “A lot of these places that are gaining Hispanics would be
losing population otherwise,” said  William Frey , a senior
fellow at the  Brookings Institution  in Washington. “In the
moderate to longer run, this will still be a large source of our
growth. Most of the Hispanic growth is due to natural increase,
not from immigration.”  Residents of Mexican origin jumped to 31.8 million from
20.6 million in 2000, and more than half of the Hispanic
population in the U.S. lived in  California , Texas and Florida,
census figures show. The Puerto Rican population, the second-
largest Hispanic group in the U.S., grew to 4.6 million from 3.4
million.  Residents of Cuban origin increased to 1.8 million from 1.2
million. During the past decade, residents of Salvadoran,
Dominican and Guatemalan origin each surpassed a population of 1
million.  The world’s largest economy grew to 308,745,538 residents
in 2010, with the biggest gains coming in the South and West.
The addition of 27.3 million residents was the weakest pace of
population growth in seven decades as the worst recession since
the Great Depression stunted immigration, according to the
Census Bureau.  To contact the reporters on this story:
