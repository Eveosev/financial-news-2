San Francisco Giants catcher  Buster Posey  probably will be lost for the rest of the Major League
Baseball season after breaking his leg in a home-plate collision
last night against the  Florida Marlins .  Posey, last season’s National League Rookie of the Year,
has a fractured bone in his lower left leg, the Giants said on
their Twitter feed. On its website, the team listed him as being
on the 15-day disabled list and “likely out for season.”  The 24-year-old was injured in the top of the 12th inning
when the Florida Marlins’ Scott Cousins collided with him while
trying to beat a throw by right fielder Nate Schierholtz.
Posey’s left leg was trapped under him as Cousins dived head
first, barreling into the catcher as Posey tried to protect the
plate.  Posey never gained control of the throw and Cousins scored,
leading to the Marlins’ 7-6 victory.  Posey is batting .284 this season with four home runs and
21 runs batted in. He batted .305 with 18 home runs and 67 RBIs
last season, helping the Giants to their first World Series
title since 1954, when they were based in  New York .  San Francisco leads the NL West with a 27-21 record, 2 1/2
games ahead of the  Arizona Diamondbacks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
