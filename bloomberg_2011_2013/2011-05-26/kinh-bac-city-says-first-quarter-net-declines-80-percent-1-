Kinh Bac City Development Share
Holding Corp. (KBC) ,  Vietnam ’s third-largest listed property company,
said first-quarter profit fell 80 percent to 51.2 billion dong
($2.5 million) as borrowing costs gained and revenue fell.  Revenue dropped 59 percent from a year earlier to 213
billion dong in the three months to March 31, according to a
statement on the company’s website today. Financial costs,
including interest payments, increased 74 percent to 74.6
billion dong in the period, the statement said.  Vietnam’s central bank on May 17 boosted the repurchase
rate for the sixth time this year to curb inflation that’s
surged to the fastest pace since 2008. Prices rose 19.78 percent
in May, according to the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  Interest-rate payments have become a “major component” of
production costs for Vietnamese companies, VinaCapital
Investment Management Ltd. said on May 23. “High  interest rates 
are killing the smaller companies,” said Alan Pham, chief
economist at VinaCapital.  Kinh Bac City, which is based in Bac Ninh province, near
Hanoi, said earlier it was targeting full-year profit of 1
trillion dong. In 2010, profit was 1.1 trillion dong.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang. Editors: Jake Lloyd-Smith, Terje Langeland  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
