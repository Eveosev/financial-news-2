Turkmenistan, the holder of the
world’s fourth-biggest natural gas reserves, said its South
Yoloten gas field is the world’s second largest deposit.  The field covers 4,000 square kilometers (1,500 square
miles), the Turkmen state-owned news service said yesterday on
its  website , citing  Gaffney, Cline & Associates ’ preliminary
estimates. The nation plans to invest about $10 billion to tap
the deposit.  Turkmenistan holds 24 trillion cubic meters of discovered
gas reserves, the news service said.  Iran ’s South Pars gas field
is the world’s largest.  The field can start exporting gas to  China  in late 2013,
 Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the contractor working at South Yoloten, said in
March.  Turkmenistan is also examining plans to export gas to
 Afghanistan ,  Pakistan ,  India  and  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
