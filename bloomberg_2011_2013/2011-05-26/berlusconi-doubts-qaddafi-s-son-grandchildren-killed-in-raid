Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  said reports that Muammar Qaddafi’s youngest son,
Saif al-Arab, and three grandchildren were killed in an allied
airstrike on Tripoli last month appear to be unfounded.  “It seems like it’s propaganda, and that the youngest son
of Qaddafi isn’t in Libya but lives in another country,”
Berlusconi said last night on “Porta a Porta,” a television
program on state-run RAI SpA. “Even the case of the three
grandchildren seems unfounded,” he added, citing information
from  Italy ’s intelligence service.  Moussa Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Libyan Foreign
Ministry, said in a May 1 news conference that Qaddafi and his
wife survived the attack that killed his son and grandchildren
late on April 30.  The  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  said aircraft had
carried out “precision strikes” against military installations
in Tripoli. “We do not target individuals,” Lieutenant-General
Charles Bouchard, who commands the alliance’s operation, said in
a  statement  on NATO’s website on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
