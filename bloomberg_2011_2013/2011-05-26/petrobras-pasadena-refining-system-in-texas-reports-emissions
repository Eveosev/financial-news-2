Pasadena Refining System Inc., a unit
of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , had a pipe nipple break off a pump at
its plant in Pasadena, Texas, according to a filing with state
regulators.  The pump was blocked and the associated vessel

Commission on Environmental Quality.  The refinery, which can process 106,500 barrels of crude a
day, has one catalytic cracker with a capacity of 56,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Pasadena plant is on the  Houston Ship Channel ,
according to the refineryâ€™s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
