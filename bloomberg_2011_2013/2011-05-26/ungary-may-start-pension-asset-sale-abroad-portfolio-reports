Hungary will probably start the sale
of private pension assets, to be transferred to the state soon,
on high-liquidity foreign markets, news portal  portfolio.hu 
said, citing Laszlo Andras Borbely, the deputy chief executive
officer at the debt management agency.  The primary objective is to raise the planned 529 billion
forint ($2.8 billion) included in this year’s budget via the
sale of pension assets, Borbely said in an interview published
today. Potential above-target proceeds may only arrive toward
the end of the year, triggering no meaningful change in the
country’s 2011 financing plan, Borbely said.  The agency may buy back debt or lower debt issuance using
any extra proceeds of bond sales coming in above the target, he
said. A decision is due toward the end of the year. “We see no
reason for now to change this year’s financing plan,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
