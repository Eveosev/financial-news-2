U.S. stock-index futures erased gains
as government data showed the economy expanded at a slower rate
than forecast in the first quarter and jobless claims
unexpectedly increased last week.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month fell less than 0.1 percent to 1,316.3 at 8:35 a.m. in  New
York  after climbing 0.5 percent earlier. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures were up 0.1 percent at 12,367 after earlier
advancing 0.5 percent.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, reflecting a smaller gain in  consumer spending 
than previously calculated. The revised rise in gross domestic
product was the same as estimated last month and compared with a
3.1 percent gain in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 2.2 percent increase.  Jobless claims increased by 10,000 to 424,000 in the week
ended May 21, Labor Department figures showed, topping the
median estimate of economists for a drop to 404,000.  U.S. stocks advanced yesterday, with benchmark indexes
snapping a three-day decline, as commodity shares rallied on
expectations for higher raw material prices amid signs of
improving demand.   The  S&P 500  has fallen 3.2 percent from an almost three-
year high on April 29 amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis
will worsen and weaker-than-forecast economic data. Indexes of
commodity producers slumped at least 5 percent during that
period to lead the retreat. Still, the benchmark gauge rose 5
percent since the end of 2010 on government stimulus measures
and higher-than-forecast profits.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
