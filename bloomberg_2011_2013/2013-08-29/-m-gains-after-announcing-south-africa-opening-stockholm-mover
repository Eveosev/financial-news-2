Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s
second-biggest clothing retailer, rose to its highest price in
11 months in Stockholm trading after announcing its first store
in  South Africa  and as Barclays Plc upgraded its rating.  H&M shares gained as much as 1.5 percent to 247 kronor,
their highest since Sept. 26 last year and steepest increase
since Aug. 13 this year. The stock advanced 1.5 percent to 246.9
kronor as of 10:14 a.m. local time, with trading volumes at 21
percent of the daily average in the past three months.  The Swedish company has signed a contract for a full-concept flagship store which will open in South Africa in 2015
at the earliest, it said in a statement today. “We see great
potential for further expansion in this region,” Chief
Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson said in the statement.  Barclays today raised its rating on H&M shares to
overweight from equal-weight, saying “investors underestimate
H&M’s potential to offer sustainable long-term outperformance in
sales growth.” The bank’s analysis indicates that H&M will
accelerate sales growth next year and probably outpace rival
 Inditex SA (ITX) , owner of the Zara chain, in the coming decade,
Christodoulos Chaviaras, an analyst at Barclays in  London , wrote
in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
