Indian stock-index futures gained as
rupee forwards increased the most in almost 12 months and  oil
prices  declined.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for August delivery, which
expire today, rose 0.6 percent to 5,299.5 at 10:08 a.m. in
 Singapore . The most-actively traded September contract gained
0.6 percent to 5,314.5. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index fell 0.1
percent to 5,285 yesterday, while the S&P BSE Sensex rose 0.2
percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-
traded shares rose 1.1 percent. One-month rupee forwards rose
for the first time in four days today, adding 1.6 percent to
67.91. The rupee plunged the most since 1993 yesterday, losing
3.9 percent to a record 68.845 per dollar.  The Sensex has tumbled 7 percent in August, driving
valuations to 9 percent below the  five-year average  yesterday,
on concerns the rupee’s record plunge and oil’s advance will
hamper government efforts to cool inflation and tackle an
unprecedented current-account deficit. Data tomorrow may show
the Indian economy grew at the slowest quarterly pace in more
than three years in the three months ended June. International
investors were net sellers of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks for a seventh day on
Aug. 27, data showed yesterday.  “There’s a bit of short-covering and rollovers expected
before the derivatives expiry,” Paras Adenwala, managing
director of Capital Portfolio Advisors, said in an interview on
Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “Valuations are cheap but unless
I see the rupee stabilizing for a few days I won’t jump in and
buy aggressively.”  Rupee Slump  Foreign investors  sold a net $208.1 million of Indian
shares on Aug. 27, paring this year’s inflow to $11.6 billion.
That’s still the second-highest among 10 Asian markets tracked
by Bloomberg.  The rupee has depreciated 20 percent this year, meaning
dollar-based investors have lost 25 percent from Sensex shares,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Sensex’s valuation has
dropped to 12.8 times estimated 12-month profit, compared with
the five-year average of 14.1 times.  A weakening currency makes imports more expensive for a
country that imports 80 percent of its oil.  India  is also the
largest importer of gold, which advanced to an all-time high of
35,074 rupees per 10 grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange of
India yesterday.  Data tomorrow may show Indian economic growth slowed to 4.6
percent in the quarter ended June 30, from 4.8 percent in the
previous three months, according to the median estimate of 43
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. That would be the slowest pace
of expansion since the quarter ended March 2009.  The economic slowdown and a weak currency are hurting
company earnings. Combined profits for the 30 companies in the
Sensex increased 1.4 percent in the three months ended June
compared with an estimate of 5.8 percent before the reporting
season began, Bank of America Corp. analysts Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Anand Kumar wrote in a report dated Aug. 19.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates, compared with 27
percent for the March quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
