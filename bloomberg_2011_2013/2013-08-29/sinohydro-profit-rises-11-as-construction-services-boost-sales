Sinohydro Group Ltd. (601669) , China’s
biggest builder of hydroelectric dams, reported an 11 percent
increase in first-half profit as construction services expanded.  Net income rose to 2.23 billion  yuan  ($364 million) from
2.01 billion yuan a year earlier, Sinohydro said today in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange. Sales jumped 20
percent to 66.2 billion yuan.  “Construction services kept a stable growth” as
investment in power and property businesses boosted their
contribution to revenue, according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
