Anglo American Plc (AAL) ’s chief executive
officer said he will close or sell more mines at the company’s
South African platinum unit if profits don’t improve next year.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer
of the metal, is reducing staff, idling shafts and shrinking
annual output by 350,000 ounces to revive earnings growth.
Earlier this month, the Johannesburg-based company said it may
cut as many as 6,900 jobs.  “I’d expect that we can see the turnaround and that we can
see it on the ground next year,” Anglo American CEO  Mark Cutifani  said today in an interview in Johannesburg. “At the
end of the day if we have shafts or operations that don’t make
money, then we’ll make the tough calls.”  Platinum producers in  South Africa , which has the largest
known reserves of the metal, are seeking ways to curb costs
after strikes last year led to above-inflation wage increases
while prices dropped.  Amplats, as the Anglo American platinum unit is known, will
have to deliver a return on capital of 15 percent, in line with
the rest of the group’s business units, Cutifani said.  “If operations bleed cash then they will be closed or
sold,” said Cutifani, who took over as CEO of Anglo American in
April. “If they are not delivering the returns but they are
creating cash, they certainly wouldn’t be closed, but they would
be considered for sale.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
