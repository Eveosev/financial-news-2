MAN SE (MAN)  provided investors with data
about the valuation of the company that might be used to force
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  to increase the amount it needs to pay minority
shareholders as part of a full takeover of the truckmaker.  MAN turned over the information after a court case was
filed by Dusseldorf-based investor and publisher of finance
magazine  Effecten-Spiegel (EFS)  AG. The truckmaker didn’t properly
respond to a request for the data at a shareholder meeting in
June, according to Effecten-Spiegel.  “For us, this is a first victory,” said Peter Dreier, a
lawyer for the investor. “It shows we’re on the right track.”  The case may be a prelude to litigation over the payout MAN
shareholders get under the profit transfer and domination
agreement approved at the June 6 meeting. VW, which already owns
just over 75 percent of MAN, is proposing purchasing the
truckmaker’s remaining stock for 80.89 euros ($107.31) a share.  MAN spokesman Sacha Klingner said the company sent
information to the investor in a  letter  dated July 10. He
declined to comment further on the suit.  Ferdinand Piech, supervisory board chairman at both
Volkswagen and MAN, said at the June meeting that he expects a
drawn-out legal battle with investors seeking a higher price.  Today’s case is LG Muenchen, 5 HKO 13701/13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
