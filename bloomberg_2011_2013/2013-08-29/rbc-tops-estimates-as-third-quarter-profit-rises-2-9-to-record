Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, said third-quarter profit rose 2.9
percent to a record on gains in its wealth-management business.
Royal Bank raised its  dividend  6.3 percent to 67 cents.  Net income for the period ended July 31 rose to C$2.3
billion ($2.19 billion), or C$1.52 a share, from C$2.24 billion,
or C$1.47, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in
a statement.  Royal Bank benefited from 51 percent increase in profit
from its wealth-management unit as fund sales and improving
stock markets lifted fee-based client assets. The lender also
added contributions from its RBC Investor Services custodian
business after buying out partner Banque Internationale a
Luxembourg SA in July 2012.  Profit excluding some items was C$1.48 a share, the bank
said, beating the C$1.38  average estimate  of 13 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Royal Bank is the fifth of  Canada ’s six biggest banks to
report quarterly results. Earlier today, Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce said profit rose 5.8 percent to C$890 million, or
C$2.16 a share, beating analysts’ estimates.  CIBC’s earnings were aided by a 34 percent gain in its
wealth-management unit, as well as increases in  investment
banking  and record profit in Canadian  consumer lending . CIBC
said in a separate statement that it plans to buy back as many
as 8 million shares, or 2 percent of its stock.  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss
quarterly results at 7:30 a.m. Toronto time at +1-416-695-7806
or 1-888-789-9572, passcode 2674741 or at
