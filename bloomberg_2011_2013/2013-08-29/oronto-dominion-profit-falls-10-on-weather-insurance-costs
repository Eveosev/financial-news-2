Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ,  Canada ’s
second-largest lender, said quarterly profit fell 10 percent
after posting insurance losses from severe weather claims in its
home country. The bank raised its  dividend  4.9 percent to 85
cents a share.  Net income for the period ended July 31 fell to C$1.53
billion ($1.46 billion), or C$1.58 a share, from C$1.7 billion,
or C$1.78, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender said today
in a statement. Revenue rose 1.9 percent to C$5.95 billion from
a year earlier.  Rain-swollen rivers caused flooding in southern  Alberta  in
June and a record deluge in Toronto submerged parts of Canada’s
most populous city on June 8, hurting insurance results. The
bank said its wealth-management and insurance unit had profit of
C$7 million, down from C$360 million a year earlier.  Toronto-Dominion, the last of Canada’s six biggest banks to
report quarterly results, said earnings excluding some items
were C$1.65 a share, beating the C$1.53 average  estimate  of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m.
