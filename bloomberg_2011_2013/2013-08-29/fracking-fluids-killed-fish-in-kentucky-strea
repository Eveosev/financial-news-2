Hydraulic fracturing fluids that
spilled from natural gas wells in 2007 probably caused the
“widespread death or distress” of fish in a  Kentucky  stream,
according to the U.S. Interior Department.  Chemicals that entered the Acorn Fork creek, about 120
miles (193 kilometers) southeast of Lexington, polluted water
supplies and resulted in “a significant die-off” of species
including the federally threatened Blackside dace, according to
a government  statement  yesterday. The findings were from a joint
study by the  U.S. Geological Survey  and the Fish & Wildlife
Service.  “This is an example of how the smallest creatures can act
as a canary in a  coal mine ,” Tony Velasco, an ecologist at the
Fish & Wildlife office and co-author of the study, said in the
statement. “These species use the same water as we do, so it is
just as important to keep our waters clean for people and for
wildlife.”  Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves injecting
pressurized water, chemicals and sand underground to shatter
rock and gain access to fuel. It is the most common form of gas-well development in Kentucky, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
