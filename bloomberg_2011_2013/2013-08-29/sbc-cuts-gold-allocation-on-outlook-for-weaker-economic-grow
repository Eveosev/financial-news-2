HSBC Bank Plc reduced gold’s
weighting in its strategic portfolio, citing an outlook for
weaker economic growth and slow inflation.  HSBC lowered its bullion allocation to 4 percent in its
three-year-view portfolio, compared with 7 percent in July,
Fredrik Nerbrand, the bank’s London-based global head of asset
allocation, said today in an e-mailed report. It also gave
commodities a smaller allotment. HSBC left gold’s weighting
unchanged at 5 percent in its six-month-view tactical portfolio.  “We cut our weights to gold and commodities, as both
appear to be poor strategic investments given the economic
outlook,” Nerbrand said. Raw materials and gold “are likely to
face headwinds given the slower emerging-market growth rate and
continued weakness in developed markets.”  Gold tumbled 16 percent this year as U.S. inflation
remained below the  Federal Reserve ’s 2 percent target rate. At
the same time, prospects for an economic recovery raised
speculation the central bank would slow bond-buying that helped
the precious metal cap a 12-year bull run in 2012.  “Less accommodative monetary policy, weak growth and low
inflation will conspire to generate low returns across asset
classes,” Nerbrand said.  HSBC cut the weighting for commodities in its three-year-view portfolio to 3 percent, from 6 percent a month earlier,
according to the report. The bank said its strategic position is
now in an overall commodity index, instead of investments in
individual raw materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
