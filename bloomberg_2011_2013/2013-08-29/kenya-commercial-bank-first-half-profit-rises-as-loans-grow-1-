Kenya  Commercial Bank Ltd., the East
African nation’s biggest lender by market value, said first-half
profit jumped 18 percent as earnings from loans grew.  Net income climbed to 7.19 billion shillings ($82 million)
in the six months through June from 6.09 billion shillings a
year earlier, Chief Executive Officer Joshua Oigara told
reporters today in the capital, Nairobi. Net interest income,
the money banks earn from interest charges on loans, climbed 13
percent to 16.1 billion shillings, he said.  “The growth in profits were driven by higher income and
improving cost management despite restructuring costs,”
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital ( East Africa ) Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients. The bank paid 750 million shillings to
employees who took early retirement, Oigara said.  Kenya’s central bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  by 2.5
percentage points in the first half to 8.5 percent, while
commercial lenders reduced their average lending rates to about
17.9 percent from 18.7 percent over the same period, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kenyan banks’ gross loans and advances increased 12 percent
to 1.44 trillion shillings in May 2013 from a year earlier,
according to data from the central bank. The additional lending
was channeled to households, trade, manufacturing, and real
estate, it said.  Sustained Growth  KCB, as the lender is known, expects its earnings growth
rate to be sustained in the second half as more loans are
issued, Oigara said. The bank plans to reduce its cost-to-income
ratio to 50 percent by December from 54.6 percent in June,
Oigara said.  Equity Bank Ltd., Kenya’s second-largest lender by market
value, said last month profit during the period climbed 17
percent, while rivals  Barclays Bank  of Kenya Ltd. and Standard
Chartered Bank of Kenya Ltd., reported declines of 13 percent
and 0.4 percent respectively.  KCB shares rallied 43 percent this year on the Nairobi
Securities Exchange, outperforming the FTSE-NSE 25 index, which
has gained 23 percent. The stock fell 1.2 percent to 42.5
shillings by 1:21 p.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
