GDF Suez SA (GSZ) , owner of Europe’s
biggest natural gas network, is considering exploring for shale
oil and gas in Germany, Poland, the U.K. and in  Latin America .  “We are already doing a little in Germany,” Chief
Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet told a business conference
outside Paris yesterday. He also added Brazil and Chile to the
list.  “For the moment, we are evaluating and analyzing,” he
said later in an interview. “We will then decide.”  GDF Suez’s move into shale exploration would come amid a
continued ban in its home country of France on hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, a drilling technology used to extract
oil and gas. Mestrallet, along with  Total SA (FP)  Chief Executive
Officer Christophe de Margerie, has been among the most vocal
corporate executives for changes in the French policy. GDF Suez
is based in Courbevoie, France.  France should ease the ban so it can estimate the size of
its shale oil and gas reserves, a parliamentary report concluded
in June. French President  Francois Hollande  said July 14 he
won’t allow fracking.  “It’s unbelievable to think we are closing our eyes to
shale,” Jean-Louis Schilansky, head of the oil lobby  Union
Francaise des Industries Petrolieres , told the same conference.
“France will be isolated on this subject and that’s not
tenable. We are now keeping company with Bulgaria.”  The French parliament banned fracking in 2011 under former
President  Nicolas Sarkozy . France and Poland have the greatest
potential for recoverable shale gas in Europe, the  International
Energy Agency  has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
