French industrial confidence
unexpectedly climbed for a fourth month, suggesting that a
recovery that began in the second quarter is gaining strength.  Sentiment (INSESYNT)  among factory executives jumped to 98 in August
from 95 in July, national statistics office Insee said today in
a statement from Paris. Economists had expected a reading of 95,
according to the median of 16 forecasts gathered by  Bloomberg
News .  The improvement aids President  Francois Hollande , who’s
trying to revive an economy that had barely grown in two years
before expanding at a 0.5 percent in the second quarter. The
government’s own forecasts still show that  gross domestic
product  will be essentially unchanged in all of 2013.  “This confirms the improvement in the economy that has
been under way in Europe and France for several months,” said
Fabrice Montagne, an economist at Barclays Plc in Paris. “The
rebound is quite strong, it’s good news.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
