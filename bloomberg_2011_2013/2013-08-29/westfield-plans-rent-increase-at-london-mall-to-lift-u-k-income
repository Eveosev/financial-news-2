Westfield Group (WDC) , the  world’s biggest 
shopping mall operator by assets, said it will raise rents at
its west London mall for tenants that include Apple Inc. and
luxury fashion label Miu Miu, to boost U.K. earnings this year.  “Sales have been very strong,”  Peter Lowy , co-Chief
Executive Officer of the Sydney-based company, said in a
telephone interview today. “The retailers at Westfield London
have had five years of trading now, they’ve been doing very
well, and now it’s time for the rents to catch up to the sales
revenue.”  Westfield expects comparable net operating income in the
U.K. to jump as much as 5 percent for the year ending Dec. 31,
after recording a 0.2 percent increase in the six months ended
June 30, it said in a regulatory filing today.  Retail sales at  Westfield London  rose 1.9 percent to 970
million pounds ($1.5 billion) in the first half from the
previous six months, and were up 7.3 percent to 965 million
pounds at its Stratford City mall for the same period, it said.
The rent increases will be implemented following five-year
reviews with tenants at the mall, which was completed in 2008,
Lowy said.  “If I was a retailer, I’d be pretty nervous,” Stuart
Cartledge, Melbourne-based managing director of Phoenix
Portfolios, said by telephone today. “They’ll be asked for a
pretty big rent rise to deliver the 4 percent to 5 percent
growth that Westfield’s forecasting.”  London Expansion  U.K. retail sales rose 1.8 percent in the three months
through July from the previous quarter, the most since March
2004, the  Office for National Statistics  said. Recent surveys of
services, manufacturing and construction all showed improvements
in July.  Westfield  shares  slipped 1.2 percent to A$11.00 as of 1:06
p.m. in Sydney, shrinking gains this year to 4.2 percent.  Westfield is proceeding with an expansion of Westfield
London, at White City, after receiving approval for more than
500,000 square feet (46,452 square meters) of space, including a
department store and about 200,000 square feet of smaller
stores, Lowy said. Westfield also has approval for 1,500
apartments on the site, where it expects to begin work near the
end of 2015, he said.  “We’ve been conceptually planning this from long before
the mall even opened,” Lowy said. “We’ll work over a number of
years to create value from the apartments. You can sell it as a
development that’s ready to go, an apartment developer builds
the flats, puts the money in it and sells it, or we might joint
venture it.”  Geographic Breakdown  The U.K. accounted for 14 percent of assets under
management, the U.S. 30 percent,  Australia  52 percent and  New
Zealand  4 percent as of June 30, Westfield said today.  With as much as half of earnings coming from outside
Australia when borrowings are accounted for, the home currency’s
decline against its U.S. and U.K. counterparts helps Westfield,
Lowy said. The Australian dollar fell to a low of 88.48 U.S.
cents this month from a high of $1.0582 in April. It weakened to
57.2 pence from a 2013 peak of 69.6 pence in March.  “You need the currency to have fallen for a sustained
period of time for it to be seen in earnings,” he said.  Funds from operations  at Westfield slipped 3 percent to
A$729 million ($654 million) in the six months to June 30, as
A$4.9 billion of asset sales in 2012 and 2013 cut property
income. Net property income, adjusted for the divestments, rose
6 percent, and management income rose 7 percent, as assets under
management soared 10 percent.  More Projects  Westfield now has A$2.8 billion of development projects in
progress, including the retail part of the World Trade Center in
 New York  to be completed in 2015. It has a further A$12 billion
planned, including a mall in Milan that it is developing in
partnership with Italian firm Gruppo Stilo, the expansion of
Westfield London and Century City mall in  Los Angeles , it said
today.  “Starting in 2015, we’ll start rolling out those starts,”
Lowy said.  The company expects to sell about A$1 billion of malls in
the U.S. in the next 18 months, and continues to consider
investments in  Brazil  after announcing a decision to dissolve
its joint venture with the Almeida Junior Family in April, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
