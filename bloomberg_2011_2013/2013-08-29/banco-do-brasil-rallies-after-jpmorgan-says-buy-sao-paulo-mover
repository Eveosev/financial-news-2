Banco do Brasil SA ,  Latin America ’s
biggest lender by assets, rose after  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
recommended buying the stock, saying investors are
overestimating the state-controlled bank’s risk.  The  shares  gained 3.4 percent to 22.84 reais at 1:19 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the biggest advance on a closing basis since Aug.
22. The rally was the biggest on the MSCI Brazil/Financials
index, which added 1.4 percent.  JPMorgan initiated coverage of  Banco do Brasil  with an
overweight recommendation, saying today in a research note that
concern over the government’s demand that the Brasilia-based
lender increase financing to spur economic growth is
exaggerated. JPMorgan set a 2014 target price of 28 reais.  “We see the risk to reward profile as asymmetrically
positive at current very depressed valuation,”  Saul Martinez ,
Domingos Falavina and Christopher Delgado, analysts at JPMorgan,
wrote in the research note.  Banco do Brasil’s shares trade at 6.1 times Banco do
Brasil’s estimated earnings for 2014, the lowest ratio among
Latin American banks that JPMorgan covers, the firm said in the
research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
