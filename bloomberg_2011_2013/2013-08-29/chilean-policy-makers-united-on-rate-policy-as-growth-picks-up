Chilean policy makers were unanimous
in their decision to leave  interest rates  unchanged last month,
the minutes of the meeting showed, while manufacturing grew more
than analysts expected in July.  Central bank directors all agreed to leave the key rate at
5 percent for a 19th consecutive month amid “dynamic” domestic
demand, according to the minutes released today. In a separate
report, the  National Institute of Statistics  said that
manufacturing grew 4.7 percent in July from a year earlier,
almost six times faster than analysts forecast, while retail
sales leaped 10.3 percent.  Central bank Governor Rodrigo Vergara said this week that
policy makers are waiting for somewhat more significant signs
that demand is slowing before they cut rates. Still, that
doesn’t mean they have to wait until consumer demand has braked,
he told the newspaper Diario Financiero.  Today’s report provided little evidence of a slowdown in
demand. Retail sales growth accelerated from 7.7 percent in June
and was the third fastest this year.  The median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for manufacturing growth of only 0.8 percent last month, and
retail sales growth of 9.2 percent.  Bank lending growth accelerated to an annual 9.29 percent
in June from 8.73 percent in May, the banking regulator reported
this week.  The economy expanded 4.2 percent in June from the year
earlier, bringing growth in the second quarter to 4.1 percent.
The central bank forecasts growth of between 4 percent and 5
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
