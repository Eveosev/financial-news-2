Canada ’s  current account  deficit
widened in the second quarter as imports of automobiles rose and
exports of crude oil declined.  The deficit of C$14.6 billion (C$13.9 billion) from April
to June compares with a revised C$13.4 billion shortfall in the
first quarter,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a C$14.8 billion
deficit according to the median of 15 responses.  Exporters have struggled to rebuild orders lost in the
global financial crisis amid weak foreign demand and with
Canada’s currency trades near parity with the  U.S. dollar . Those
drags may ease later this year allowing the current-account
deficit to narrow, said  Benjamin Reitzes , a senior economist at
BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.  “We are looking for the  U.S. economy  to pick up steam
through the rest of this year and through 2014, which along with
a weaker loonie, points to a narrowing current account deficit
for Canada,” Reitzes wrote in a note to clients.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known, was 0.1 percent
weaker at C$1.0494 per U.S. dollar at 9:49 a.m. in Toronto after
the U.S. Commerce Department in  Washington  said gross domestic
product rose at a 2.5 percent annualized rate, up from an
initial estimate of 1.7 percent.  Canada’s deficit in goods widened to C$3.10 billion in the
second quarter from C$1.95 billion in the prior three months,
today’s report showed.  Imports of motor vehicles and parts rose C$700 million,
leading the C$1.4 billion increase in goods payments to C$121.3
billion. For exports, energy products such as crude oil fell by
C$800 million. This reduced the increase in receipts to C$200
million to a total of C$118.2 billion.  The current-account deficits that began in 2008 during the
global financial crisis will continue for at least another year,
and equal 2.5 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in
the third quarter of 2014, according to a Bloomberg economist
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
