Citigroup Inc. (C)  agreed to undertake
an audit of its online credit card account system as part of an
accord with Connecticut following an investigation that found
hackers could access multiple accounts.  The investigation found a “known technical vulnerability”
in the bank’s Account Online web-based service, Connecticut
Attorney General George Jepsen said in a statement today
announcing the settlement.  “This vulnerability was known to the company at the time
of the breach and may have existed since 2008,” he said.  New York-based Citigroup will obtain a third-party data
security audit, the state said. The investigation was conducted
by Connecticut and California Attorney General  Kamala Harris .  The bank will also pay $55,000.  Customer data that is “critical to commit identity theft”
was not accessed, said Emily Collins, a spokeswoman for the
bank.  “Citi has and will continue to comply with all applicable
information security laws and customer notification
requirements,” Collins said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
