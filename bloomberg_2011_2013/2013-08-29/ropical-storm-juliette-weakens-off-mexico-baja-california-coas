Tropical Storm Juliette’s top winds
weakened as it skirted the Pacific coast of  Mexico ’s Baja
California Peninsula.  The wind speed dropped to 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour
from 50 mph, the U.S.  National Hurricane Center  said in an
advisory at 11 a.m.  New York  time. It was 80 miles northwest of
Cabo San Lazaro, Mexico, moving northwest at 22 mph.  “Juliette should continue to weaken today as it moves over
colder waters and the cyclone is expected to become a remnant
low within 24 hours” the Miami-based center said.  Tropical storm warnings are in effect from Puerto San
Andresito to Punta Eugenia. Warnings issued for the east coast
of Baja have been dropped.  Forecasters are tracking two areas of disorganized
thunderstorms in the Atlantic. The clusters, one off  Africa ’s
west coast and the other in the central Atlantic, have a 10
percent chance of becoming tropical systems in the next two
days.  Juliette is the 10th storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane
season, which runs from May 15 to Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
