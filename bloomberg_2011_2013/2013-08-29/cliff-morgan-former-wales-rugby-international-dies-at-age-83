Former  Wales  rugby captain Cliff
Morgan has died at age 83, the Welsh Rugby Union said.  The Cardiff fly-half won 29 caps for his country between
1951 and 1958 and was part of the team that defeated Ireland,
 England , Scotland and France in 1952 for a “Grand Slam” in the
Five Nations tournament.  He became Wales captain in 1956 following his performance
in the British and Irish team’s tour of  South Africa  the
previous year. Morgan played in all four Tests in the Lions’
series that ended 2-2 and led the side in the final two matches
after an injury to Ireland’s Robin Thompson.  “His exploits as a player for Cardiff, Wales, the
Barbarians and the British and Irish Lions are legendary,”
Dennis Gethin, the Welsh Rugby Union president, said on the  WRU
website . “I have lost a friend and we have all lost one of
rugby’s greats who was also a true gentleman,” he added.  After his retirement from the game, Morgan went on to be a
commentator and television producer for the British Broadcasting
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
