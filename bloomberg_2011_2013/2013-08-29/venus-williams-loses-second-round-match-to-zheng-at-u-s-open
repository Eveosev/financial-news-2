Two-time champion  Venus Williams 
lost in three sets today at the  U.S. Open  to Chinaâ€™s Zheng Jie,
the third straight year she has lost in the second round.  Williams, 33, who won the tournament in 2000 and 2001, has
fallen to No. 60 in the world rankings while battling an auto-immune disease.  Zheng, ranked 56th, won 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5) in three hours,
one minute on the Louis Armstrong Stadium court at the National
Tennis Center in New York.  Williams, whose career has included seven Grand Slam
singles titles among her 44 tournament wins and has more than
$28.7 million in winnings, was playing in her 60th Grand Slam
tournament -- most among active players.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
