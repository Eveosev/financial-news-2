New York  spot gasoline dropped to
the weakest level against futures in a week as Irving Oil Corp.
restarted a unit at its Saint John,  New Brunswick , refinery.  Irving’s  Saint John plant  returned a 70,000-barrel-a-day
fluid catalytic cracker to service yesterday after an unplanned
outage Aug. 23, according to a report by Genscape Inc. The
298,800-barrel-a-day refinery exports over half of its refined
products to the U.S. Northeast.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New York weakened 0.25
cent to 0.88 cent a gallon under New York Mercantile Exchange
futures at 11:54 a.m., the lowest level in a week and third
consecutive decline. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
slid 0.12 cent to a premium of 2.88 cents.  Prices rallied last week after unplanned outages occurred
at Irving’s Saint John refinery and  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ’s
185,000-barrel-a-day Trainer,  Pennsylvania , plant.  Supplies of gasoline  in the region including the New York
Harbor, referred to as PADD 1B, slipped 310,000 barrels to a
four-week low of 29.9 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 23,
a government report showed yesterday.  The spread between RBOB in New York and the  Gulf Coast 
widened 1 cent to 24.8 cents a gallon, the  widest differential 
since December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and diesel based on Brent oil in
 Europe , declined 46 cents to $13.82 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
