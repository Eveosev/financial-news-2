Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. (KKD) , the
chain that revived itself by expanding beyond sweet treats into
coffee and smoothies, fell the most in more than two years after
reporting second-quarter profit that trailed analysts’ estimates
as costs increased.  The  shares  tumbled 15 percent to $19.72 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest drop since April 1, 2011. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company has more than doubled this
year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 15
percent.  Net income  fell 4.3 percent to $4.72 million, or 7 cents a
share, in the three months ended Aug. 4 from a year earlier,
Krispy Kreme said in a statement yesterday. Excluding certain
items, profit was 14 cents a share. Analysts on average
estimated 16 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The chain has tried to lure customers from  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) 
and other coffee sellers by selling fancier drinks such as
lattes and caramel mochas. It’s also opening smaller stores that
don’t make doughnuts on the premises and are cheaper to build.  General and administrative costs rose 19 percent to $5.66
million in the quarter, the company said. Health-care expenses
for employees were also unexpectedly higher, Chief Financial
Officer Douglas Muir said on a conference call yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
