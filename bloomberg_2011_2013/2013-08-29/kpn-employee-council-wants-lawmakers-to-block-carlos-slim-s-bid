Royal KPN NV (KPN) ’s works council wants
the government and lawmakers in the Netherlands to help block a
takeover by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMXL)  saying it fears for
the Dutch operator’s continuity and its employees.  “We call upon the cabinet and parliament to help prevent
this takeover by using your influence and drafting protective
legislation,” the council said an in e-mailed statement today.
The workers organization will use all the influence it has to
keep KPN an independent Dutch company, it said.  The statement comes a day after union delegates met with
America Movil Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj in The Hague.
The unions received a guarantee KPN’s strategy will be
continued, Joost van Herpen, a delegate for the Abvakabo union,
said yesterday. The unions also wanted solid assurances from
 America Movil  for the future of its employees.  America Movil’s support for the sale of KPN’s E-Plus unit
to  Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG (O2D)  has boosted the chance its
separate 7.2 billion-euro ($9.5 billion) takeover bid for the
Dutch telephone company will be completed. America Movil is
offering 2.40 euros a share to raise its 30 percent stake in KPN
to more than 50 percent. The independent foundation that has the
power to defend the carrier from a takeover hasn’t issued a
statement following Slim’s announcement supporting the E-Plus
sale.  KPN shares closed down 0.7 percent at 2.29 euros today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
