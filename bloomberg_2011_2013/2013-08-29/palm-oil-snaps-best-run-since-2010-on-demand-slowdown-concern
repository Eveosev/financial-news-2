Palm oil  dropped on concern that a
rally to the highest close in five months may erode demand for
the most-used edible oil just as  India , the biggest buyer,
grapples with a record low currency that will raise import costs.  Palm for November delivery lost as much as 1.2 percent to
2,452 ringgit ($738) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives, the biggest intraday decline for the most-active
contract since Aug. 20, and traded at 2,454 ringgit at 12:13 p.m.
in Kuala Lumpur. Palm for physical delivery in September was at
2,510 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Futures, which rallied for six days to yesterday in the
best run since December 2010, ended at the highest level since
March 22 as crude oil surged. India’s rupee plummeted the most
in two decades to a record as the surge in crude oil threatened
to worsen a current-account deficit and push the economy toward
its biggest crisis since 1991.  “There are worries that demand could slow as prices have
been moving up a lot,” Donny Khor, deputy director of futures
and commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd., said from  Kuala
Lumpur . “Another point of concern is the fall in the Indian
rupee as a weaker currency would mean they have to pay more.”  Palm is still heading for the first monthly advance in
Kuala Lumpur since May. Shipments from the largest producer
after  Indonesia  rose 7.1 percent to 1.16 million tons in first
25 days August from the same period in July, Intertek estimates.  Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.4 percent to $13.7775
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in December declined 0.7 percent to 44.46 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery fell 0.5 percent to
5,698  yuan  ($931) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  declined 0.6 percent to 7,290 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
