Singapore ’s  middle-distillate 
inventories surged 46 percent, the most in more than seven
years, according to a unit of the Trade and Industry Ministry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene rose by 2.78 million barrels to 8.8 million in the
seven days through yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the biggest increase
since June 2006.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, climbed by 1.56
million barrels, or 7.5 percent, to 22.2 million, according to
the data. That’s the highest level in 10 weeks.  Stockpiles of  light distillates , including naphtha,
reformate and gasoline, declined by 197,000 barrels, or 1.9
percent, to 10 million, the data show. Supplies slid for the
first time in three weeks.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners, oil traders and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, it said. Singapore is  Asia ’s
largest oil-trading and storage center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
