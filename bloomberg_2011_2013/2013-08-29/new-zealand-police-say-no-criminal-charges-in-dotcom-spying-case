New Zealand police  today ruled out
laying criminal charges in relation to the government spying on
Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom.  While the Government Communications & Security Bureau did
contravene the Crimes Act by intercepting communications between
Dotcom and an associate, it “did not have the necessary intent
to satisfy the elements of the offense and be considered
criminally liable,” police said in a statement. “No criminal
charges will be laid against any person.”  Prime Minister John Key was forced to apologize to Dotcom
in September for the GCSB’s surveillance of him during a U.S.-
led operation to close his Megaupload website on piracy charges
earlier last year. The government this month changed the law to
allow the GCSB to spy on New Zealand citizens under certain
circumstances. The agency was previously restricted to
monitoring “foreign” communications, organizations and people.  While Dotcom was born in  Germany  as Kim Schmitz, he has New
Zealand residency.  Dotcom still faces extradition to the U.S., which has
described his cloud-storage Internet site as the biggest
copyright infringement case in its history.  Armed police stormed Dotcom’s Auckland mansion in January
last year, seizing 18  luxury vehicles , including a 1959 pink
Cadillac, art, cash, computers and hard drives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
