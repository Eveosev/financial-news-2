Royal Unibrew A/S (RBREW)  rose to a record
in Copenhagen trading as Nordea Bank AB said the Nordic region’s
second-largest brewer will resume dividend payments as soon as
next year.  Unibrew rose as much as 3.6 percent to 642 kroner, its
highest since the company listed in 1998. The stock added 3.1
percent to 639 kroner at 11:14 a.m. in the Danish capital, with
trading volume at 63 percent of the three-month daily average.  Unibrew has suspended dividend payments and share buybacks
until 2015 after agreeing last month to buy Heineken NV’s Oy
Hartwall brewery for 2.8 billion kroner ($500 million). Nordea
said today the Fakse, Denmark-based company probably will resume
payments in 2014 as the Hartwall acquisition is a better deal
than the bank previously estimated and sales of malt-based
drinks are climbing. The company reported yesterday second-quarter net income that beat analyst  estimate s by 15 percent.  ”Even though the stock has gained a lot recently, we still
see good long-term potential in the share,” Nordea said. The
bank raised a share price estimate to 725 kroner from 675 kroner
and repeated a buy recommendation for the stock, which has
doubled in value over the last 20 months.  Unibrew has given investors a  3.8 percent dividend yield  in
the past year. That compares with a 1.9 percent average for the
155 stocks in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen all-share index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
