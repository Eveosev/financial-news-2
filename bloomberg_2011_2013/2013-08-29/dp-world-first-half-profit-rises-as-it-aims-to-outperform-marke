DP World Ltd., the world’s third-largest ports operator, posted a 9.1 percent increase in first-half profit, beating analysts’ estimates, as it focused on fast-growing markets and monetized assets in  Hong Kong .  Net income rose to $264 million, or 31.8 cents a share,
from $242 million, or 29.1 cents, the Dubai-based company said
in a statement to  Nasdaq Dubai (DPW)  today. The mean estimate of three
analysts was for net income of $229.6 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 1.3 percent to $1.51
billion compared to $1.53 billion a year ago.  DP World, which operates more than 65 terminals across six
continents, said in March it made $249 million from asset sales
in  Australia ,  Europe  and the  Middle East . It invested $544
million this year across its portfolio and expects to have
capacity of about 85 million twenty-foot equivalent units
globally in 2015.  “We have a strong balance sheet which provides us with the
flexibility to support growth in our existing business, and
expand capacity in line with market demand,” Chief Executive
Mohammed Sharaf said in the statement. “Moreover, we have the
financial resources to add to our portfolio should favorable
assets at attractive prices become available.”  The industry outlook remains “uncertain” and market
conditions in some regions are “undoubtedly challenging,” he
said, adding that he remained “confident” of meeting full-year
targets.  “We believe we are well positioned to continue to
outperform the market in the medium term,” he said.  DP World’s capital expenditure guidance of $3.7 billion
from 2012 to 2014 remains unchanged, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
