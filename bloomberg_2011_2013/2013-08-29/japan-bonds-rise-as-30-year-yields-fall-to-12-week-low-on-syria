Japanese  government bonds  rose,
pushing 30-year yields to the lowest level in 12 weeks, as the
threat of military intervention in  Syria  increased demand for
the relative safety of the Asian nation’s debt.  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped to the lowest in more
than three months. A 2.7 trillion yen ($27.3 billion) sale of
two-year debt today drew  bids  worth 5.56 times the amount
available, down from the bid-to-cover ratio of 9.27 last month
that was the highest since January.  “There is a lot of uncertainty around Syria, and bonds
tend to be bid as safe assets in such an environment,” said
Makoto Suzuki, a senior bond strategist at Okasan Securities Co.
in  Tokyo .  Japan’s 10-year  yield  slid 1/2 basis point to 0.71 percent
as of 5:14 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond Trading Co.
That was the lowest since May 10. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Thirty-year yields declined to 1.745 percent, the lowest
level since June 4. Twenty-year yields fell to 1.63 percent, the
least since June 10. The two-year rate slid 1/2 basis point to
0.105 percent, a level unseen since April 9.  The U.S. and the U.K. said yesterday they are prepared to
take military action against Syria without authorization from
the  United Nations Security Council , as they prepared evidence
that the Middle Eastern regime used chemical weapons on its
people.  Japan ’s sovereign bonds have  returned  1.3 percent this year
compared with a 3.3 percent slide in U.S. Treasuries, based on
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. The  Bank of Japan  buys more than 7
trillion yen of JGBs per month to spur the economy, while
Federal Reserve policy makers are debating how and when to
reduce their quantitative easing program.  Auction Delay  Japanese bonds returned 0.6 percent and Treasuries fell 0.8
percent in August, according to the Bloomberg indexes.  The results of today’s auction of the 0.1 percent notes
were delayed to 1:15 p.m. from 12:45 p.m. due to a processing
issue, according to the Ministry of Finance. The 5.56 bid-to-cover ratio compares with the average of 5.3 in the past five
years.  “There was no impact from the delay in the results,” said
 Takafumi Yamawaki , the Tokyo-based chief rates strategist at
JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of 23 primary dealers obliged to bid
at JGB sales. “The JGB market looks solid as the BOJ purchases
will continue to support demand.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
