Arsenal re-signed midfielder Mathieu Flamini, bringing the midfielder back to the Premier League club
after five seasons at AC Milan.  Flamini, 29, made 153 appearances for Arsenal from 2004 to
2008. He then joined Milan, playing in 122 games before becoming
a free agent after last season.  Flamini helped Arsenal win the 2005 F.A. Cup and reach the
final of the  Champions League  in 2006, when he played at left-back for much of the campaign. He’d been training with the club
the past few weeks.  “We’re very pleased Mathieu has agreed to rejoin us,”
manager  Arsene Wenger  said on the club’s  website . “He is a
player of real quality, with a fantastic work rate and great
mentality. As we know, Mathieu is a strong midfielder, but is
also is comfortable playing in defense too. He is a very good
addition to our squad.”  Arsenal hosts north London rival Tottenham in the Premier
League in three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
