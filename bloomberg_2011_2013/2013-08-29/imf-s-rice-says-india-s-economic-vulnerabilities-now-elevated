India’s economy  faces bigger
vulnerabilities as global liquidity tightens, presenting the
government with both a challenge and an opportunity, an
International Monetary Fund spokesman said.  “The combination of large fiscal and current-account
deficits, high and persistent inflation, sizable unhedged
corporate foreign borrowing, and reliance on portfolio inflows
are longstanding vulnerabilities that have now been elevated as
global liquidity conditions tighten,” IMF spokesman Gerry Rice
said today in a press briefing in Washington.  Rice was answering a question about the risks facing Asia’s
third-largest economy as its currency, the rupee, plummets.  “The current situation presents a challenge obviously to
the government of India, but also an opportunity for the
government to continue in its policy efforts on a variety of
fronts,” Rice said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
