Turkey’s  trade deficit  grew more
than expected in July as exports to the  Middle East  slumped and
the European Union took a higher share.  The trade deficit was $9.81 billion in the month, higher
than the median estimate of $8.7 billion in a Bloomberg survey
of three economists. The deficit in the first seven months of
the year rose to $60.5 billion, compared with $51.1 billion a
year earlier, according to data published on the statistics
office in Ankara’s website today.  The  trade balance  deteriorated as exports to the Middle
East dropped 30 percent to $3.1 billion over the same month a
year ago. Exports of precious metals including gold, which
improved Turkey’s trade balance last year on soaring demand from
Iran and the  United Arab Emirates , fell by about 75 percent to
$530 million. The EU’s share of Turkey’s total exports rose to
41.5 percent from 34.6 percent a year earlier.  The lira strengthened 0.4 percent to 2.03 per dollar at
10:20 a.m. in Istanbul, paring year-to-date losses to 12
percent. Yields on two-year benchmark notes fell 18 basis
points, or 0.18 percentage point, to 9.76 percent, compared with
a record low of 4.79 percent on May. 17.  “A monthly foreign  trade gap  under $10 billion will
continue to support positive current account deficit
expectations,” Isik Okte, a strategist at  Turkiye Halk Bankasi
AS (HALKB) ’s investment unit in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments
today before the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
