New Zealand financial adviser  David
Ross  pleaded guilty to running the nation’s biggest-ever  Ponzi
scheme , the  Serious Fraud Office  said.  Ross, 63, pleaded guilty to four counts of false accounting
and one of theft in the Wellington District Court today, the SFO
said in an e-mailed statement. He was remanded in custody until
Oct. 24, when a sentencing date will be set.  “While a guilty plea does not address the significant
losses incurred by a large number of victims, it will bring some
relief to those victims,” SFO Acting Chief Executive Simon McArley said in the statement.  The SFO and the Financial Markets Authority brought charges
against Ross, alleging he ran a Ponzi scheme through his
closely-held Ross Asset Management Ltd., which collapsed in
November last year. Ross falsely reported clients’ investments,
resulting in an overstatement of more than NZ$380 million ($297
million), the SFO said. More than 1,200 client accounts were
affected by the scheme.  Ross also pleaded guilty to FMA charges of providing
financial services when unregistered and making false
declarations to obtain an authorization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
