Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai fell to the lowest in three weeks as a decline in the
price of the raw material coke added to negative sentiment
caused by escalating tensions in  Syria .  Rebar for January delivery dropped as much as 0.7 percent
to 3,742  yuan  ($611) a metric ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Aug. 9. Futures traded at 3,755 yuan at
10:50 a.m. local time.  Futures of the steel-making ingredient coke for January
delivery fell 4.3 percent in Dalian yesterday, the biggest one-day decline for the contract since June 20. The U.S. and the U.K.
said they were ready to lead a military strike against Syria
without United Nations approval.  “Coke prices fell a lot yesterday, which will drag down
production costs for steel,” said Ren Xinlei, analyst at
Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan. “The market is also worried about
the situation in Syria.”  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $138.50 a dry ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The average spot price of
rebar was little changed yesterday at 3,605 yuan a ton,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
