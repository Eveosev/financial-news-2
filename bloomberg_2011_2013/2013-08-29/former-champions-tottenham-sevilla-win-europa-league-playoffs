Tottenham Hotspur and Sevilla were
among three former champions advancing to the group stage of
soccer’s Europa League, while fellow two-time winner Feyenoord
was eliminated.  Tottenham, which won Europe’s second-tier club competition
in 1972 and 1984, beat Dinamo Tbilisi 3-0 last night to complete
an 8-0 win over the two-match qualifying playoff. Sevilla, which
captured back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007, routed Slask
Wroclaw 5-0 for a 9-1 total victory.  Eintracht Frankfurt, the 1980 champion, beat Qarabag 2-1 to
close out a 4-1 series win. Feyenoord lost 3-1 on aggregate to
Russian team Kuban Krasnodar after a 2-1 home loss.  The 30 playoff winners will be joined in today’s group-stage draw in  Monaco  by eight automatic qualifiers and nine
playoff losers from the elite Champions League.  The final club in the 48-team field is APOEL of Cyprus,

losers in place of Fenerbahce after the Turkish club was
disqualified from European competition for match-fixing.  Besiktas, another Turkish team, was this morning replaced

Arbitration for Sport dismissed its appeal against expulsion
from the Europa League because of match-fixing, UEFA said.  Fire Delay  AZ Alkmaar lost at home 2-0 to Atromitos, but moved into
