American International Group Inc. (AIG)  is
carrying on with plans for a possible initial public offering of
its plane-leasing unit if an agreement to sell the business to
Chinese investors collapses.  AIG’s  International Lease Finance Corp. (ILFC)  issued an updated
filing today with financial results through June 30 and
information on the Los Angeles-based company’s plane fleet. The
insurer’s effort to sell the business has been delayed as the
buyers fail to complete the deal.  As of yesterday, “the closing of the transaction has not
occurred,” ILFC said in the filing. The IPO won’t happen if New
York-based AIG completes the sale, the plane lessor said.  AIG has been working to jettison ILFC to reduce  debt  and
simplify the insurer. The Chinese investors missed three
deadlines to complete the purchase, most recently at the end of
July, after agreeing in December to pay about $4.2 billion for
80 percent of ILFC. Jon Diat, an AIG spokesman, declined to
comment.  ILFC owns and manages about 1,000 aircraft, and in June
took delivery of its first Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner jet, which
is being leased to Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. ILFC is the
biggest customer for the Dreamliner, with about 74 on order.  Net income at ILFC fell to $82.6 million in the six months
ended June 30 from $321.9 million in the same period a year
earlier, according to today’s filing. Revenue from flight
equipment rentals fell 6.7 percent to $2.07 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
