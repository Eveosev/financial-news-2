Corpbanca profit may be cut as much
as 5 billion pesos ($9.8 million) this year as funding costs
rise on concern the Chilean lender faces losses tied to sister
company SMU SA, Chief Executive Officer Fernando Massu said.  Institutional clients in  Chile  have demanded a premium of
as much as 1 percentage point to lend to Corpbanca since mid-July, Massu said in an interview in his office in Santiago. SMU,
which like Corpbanca is controlled by billionaire Alvaro Saieh,
disclosed July 11 that it had breached the terms of its bond
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
