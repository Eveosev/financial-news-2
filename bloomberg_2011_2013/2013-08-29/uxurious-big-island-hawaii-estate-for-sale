32-1056 Old Mamalahoa Hwy, Ninole, HI  For sale: $26.5 million A lot of properties claim to be “one of a kind,” but as far as real estate agent  Kelly Moran  knows, there really isn’t anything else like this Hawaii estate — either on the mainland or the Big Island. “It would be very difficult to replicate,” said Moran, owner of  Hilo Brokers, Ltd . “I haven’t ever seen anything else like it.” While the home boasts a lengthy list of over-the-top features, it’s the location that really sets the property apart. Nestled on 8 acres near the former sugar plantation town of Ninole, the home is far from any tourist resort and surrounded by incredible lush landscaping overlooking the ocean. Waterfalls border the north and south ends of the property, with many of the rooms capturing both waterfall and panoramic ocean views, notes Moran. The home was a labor of love by the current owners and developers Scott Watson and Laurie Robertson. They purchased the land seven years ago, says Moran, and set about building a unique resort estate with recreational features. “A lot of celebrities and buyers in general want homes that are recreationally interesting,” Moran explained. In particular, one of the owners was a professional diver, while the other is passionate about tennis. Their combined interests led to a home that not only has an Olympic swimming pool — with three lanes and starting blocks, a 16-foot-deep diving pool with both a platform dive and Olympic springboard — but also a professional tennis court that holds stadium seating for 450. Don’t expect the tennis court to be used just for a Saturday session: There are plans to use the court for an upcoming University of Hawaii at Hilo tennis scholarship fundraiser. If tennis isn’t your thing, the home also boasts a golf course, “kiddie pool,” outdoor wet bar, grill and dining area. An additional structure holds the 4-car garage and guest suite.
