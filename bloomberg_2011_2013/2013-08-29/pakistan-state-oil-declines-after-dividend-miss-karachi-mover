Pakistan State Oil Co. Ltd., the
nation’s biggest fuel retailer, fell to the lowest in two months
in Karachi trading after saying it would pay a lower than
expected dividend following full-year earnings.  Pakistan State Oil, known as PSO, dropped as much as 4.5
percent to 298 rupees, the lowest since June 7. It will pay a
final cash dividend of 2.5 rupees a share after reporting a 38
percent rise in full-year profit.  “The payout was expected to be a little over 3 rupees,
which brought the shares down,” Faisal Bilwani, head of
international equity sales at Elixir Securities Pakistan Pvt.
Ltd. said on the phone.  Net income rose to 12.6 billion rupees ($121 million), or
50.84 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30 from 9.1
billion rupees, 36.67 rupees, a year earlier, the Karachi-based
company said today in a stock exchange filing. Gross sales
climbed to 1.29 trillion rupees from 1.2 trillion rupees year.  PSO traded at 300.80 rupees at 10:36 a.m. local time. The
stock has gained 56 percent this year, compared with a 34
percent increase in KSE 100 Index.  “Petrol sales increased 20 percent to 1.65 million during
the period as more people preferred this fuel in the face of a
shortage of compressed natural gas,” Arif Shaikh, a research
analyst for Global Securities Pakistan said by phone. Diesel
sales climbed 1 percent to 3.86 million tons, Shaikh said.  Consumers used more of the liquid fuel after reserves of
compressed natural gas, which is also used to fuel cars and
factories, declined prompting the government to reserve most of
the existing volumes for industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
