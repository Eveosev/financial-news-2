Copper dropped for a third day on
mounting tensions in Syria before a report that may show the  U.S.
economy  grew more than previously estimated, adding to the case
for the  Federal Reserve  to taper stimulus.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange sank as much as 0.6 percent to at $7,243.50 a metric
ton and traded at $7,265.25 at 11:41 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price is
up 5.6 percent this month, set for the best month since
September.  Investors are watching the Middle East after the U.S. and
the U.K. said yesterday they were ready to lead a military
strike against Syria without United Nations approval. U.S. gross
domestic product probably grew 2.2 percent in the second quarter,
up from the government’s earlier estimate of 1.7 percent, a
Bloomberg survey of economists shows.  “People are watching developments in Syria as the market
lacks upside momentum,” said Wu Jianguo, an analyst at Maike
Futures Brokerage in Shanghai.  The Fed may pare its $85 billion a month in bond purchases
at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65 percent of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13. Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  has signaled the prospect of cuts to stimulus should
the economy and job market continue to improve.  Copper for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 0.3 percent to 52,200  yuan  ($8,528) a ton. The
contract for delivery in December fell 0.2 percent at $3.305 a
pound on the Comex in New York.  On the LME, zinc also dropped, while aluminum, lead and tin
were little changed. Nickel climbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
