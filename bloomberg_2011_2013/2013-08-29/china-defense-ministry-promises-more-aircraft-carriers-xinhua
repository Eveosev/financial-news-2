China  will “surely” build more
aircraft carriers now that it has its first, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.  Asked to confirm reports that China is building its first
carrier from scratch, ministry spokesman Yang Yujun said today
“there will surely be more in the future,” according to
Xinhua. China will consider building carriers in accordance with
its defense needs, he said at a briefing.  China’s first aircraft carrier, built from an incomplete
Ukrainian hull and dubbed the Liaoning, began flight take-off
and landing tests this year. The country’s next carrier  will be
larger  and transport more fighters, Song Xue, the Chinese navy’s
deputy chief of staff, said in April.  Satellite imagery of a shipbuilding facility near  Shanghai 
suggests China started building an aircraft carrier, IHS Jane’s
Defense Weekly said earlier this month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
