Soccer ruling body FIFA  banned a
Lebanese referee who asked for free sexual services to fix a
match and six other people who sought to manipulate games.  Ali Sabbagh, who was sentenced to six months in prison for
corruption by a Singapore court in June, was provisionally
suspended by the Asian Football Confederation on Aug. 19,
pending that body’s disciplinary committee decision, Zurich-based FIFA said in an e-mailed statement.  FIFA extended lifetime bans given to Armenian referees
Andranik Arsenyan and Hovhannes Avagyan by European governing
body UEFA last week to worldwide effect after the pair admitted
to trying to manipulate a Europa League match in July.  FIFA said it also extended worldwide the lifetime ban given
to player Elvis Liivamagi by Estonia’s soccer federation and
provisionally suspended Tunisian players Marouane Troudi,
Mahmoud Dridi and Amir Jaziri for their parts in match-fixing
investigations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
