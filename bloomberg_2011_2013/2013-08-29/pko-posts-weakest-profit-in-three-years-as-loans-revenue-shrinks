PKO Bank Polski SA,  Poland ’s largest
lender, posted the lowest quarterly profit in three years as
income from loans shrank.  Net income dropped 21 percent to 752.8 million zloty ($234
million) in the second quarter from a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank said in a  presentation  on its website today. This
compares with the 724.5 million zloty  mean estimate  of 13
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net interest income, the
difference between what PKO pays on deposits and charges for
loans, fell 21 percent to 1.57 billion zloty.  State-controlled PKO has seen profit fall this year after
the country’s record cuts in  interest rates  reduced income from
loans. The  National Bank of Poland  has slashed borrowing costs
by 225 basis points, or 2.25 percentage point, since November to
2.5 percent after the country’s inflation rate slumped amid an
economic slowdown.  PKO’s fee income fell 1 percent to 772.4 million zloty in
the second quarter, while bad-loan provisions declined to 418.9
million zloty from 573.8 million zloty a year earlier.  PKO shares fell 0.8 percent to 37.8 zloty at 9:20 a.m. in
Warsaw, heading for the lowest close since Aug. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
