Vienna Insurance Group AG (VIG) ,  Austria ’s
biggest insurer, reported second-quarter profit plunged after
the worst central European floods in a decade caused damage
compensation to triple. The shares fell.  Pretax profit for the period ending June 30 dropped 69
percent to 46.3 million euros ($61.4 million), missing the 67.8
million-euro average estimate by five analysts, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Net income declined 85 percent to
16.7 million euros, while premiums contracted 8.4 percent to 2.3
billion euros, the company said in a statement today.  Weather-related “damages were three times as high as in
the same period of the previous year,” Vienna Insurance said.
The group’s combined ratio, which shows spending on claims and
costs as a percentage of premiums, improved to 95.5 percent from
98.7 percent in the first six months.  Springtime floods triggered by heavy rain caused damages in
Vienna Insurance markets including Austria,  Hungary  and the
 Czech Republic . The insurer saw flood claims of 180 million
euros and total weather-related claims of 230 million euros. The
net impact of the flood damages on Vienna Insurance’s business
was 40 million euros after reinsurance, the company said.  Vienna Insurance  shares  dropped 1.7 euros, or 4.1 percent,
to 39.20 euros at 9:55 a.m. in the Austrian capital, the biggest
intraday decline in two months. The stock is down 3 percent this
year, giving the insurer a 5 billion-euro market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
