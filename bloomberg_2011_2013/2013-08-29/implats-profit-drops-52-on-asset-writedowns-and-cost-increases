Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  said
profit declined 52 percent, missing estimates after the metal’s
second-largest producer wrote down assets by 2.3 billion rand
($223 million) and costs rose by more than inflation.  Headline earnings per share, which exclude one-time items,
were 3.30 rand for the year ended June, from 6.85 rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said today in a
statement. The result compares with the median estimate for a
profit of 3.39 rand in a survey of 19 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. The company declared a dividend of 60 cents a share.  Implats, as the company is known, operates the Rustenburg
mine in South Africa, the world’s largest platinum operation.
Producers in the country, which has the biggest reserves, are
struggling with higher costs as strikes led to above-inflation
wage gains and demand waned.  “The platinum industry is facing extremely tough times,
with static platinum group metal basket prices, low
productivity, cost pressures and industrial relations
challenges” the company said.  Implats produced 1.58 million ounces of equivalent refined
platinum, an increase of 9 percent from a year earlier. The
metal slid 3.5 percent to average $1,549 an ounce in the year.  Implats made impairments of 1.3 billion rand on long-term
receivables and a writedown of approximately 1 billion rand of
goodwill from the African Platinum Plc acquisition concluded in
the 2007 financial year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
