Soybeans rose as persistent hot, dry
weather threatens crops in the U.S., the world’s largest
producer. Corn and wheat were little changed.  Temperatures  will near 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees
Celsius) in parts of the Midwest today and tomorrow, National
Weather Service data show. Crop stress has been greatest in
parts of  Iowa  into western  Illinois , the largest corn and
soybean producing states, according to World Weather Inc. The
oilseed jumped 14 percent this month through yesterday, while
prices for the grain rose 0.4 percent.  “The hot weather is still more of an issue in soybeans
than it is in corn,” Dewey Strickler, the president of Ag Watch
Market Advisers in Franklin,  Kentucky , said by telephone. “The
corn pollinated earlier in the month, so it’s pretty well a done
deal. Beans are still subject to some dry conditions.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$13.7875 a bushel at 9:28 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price is heading for the biggest monthly gain since July
2012.  Corn futures for December delivery gained 0.1 percent to
$4.8125 a bushel in Chicago. Through yesterday, prices tumbled
40 percent in the past 12 months on the outlook for a record
U.S. harvest.  Wheat futures for December delivery slid less than 0.1
percent to $6.5925 a bushel in Chicago.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
