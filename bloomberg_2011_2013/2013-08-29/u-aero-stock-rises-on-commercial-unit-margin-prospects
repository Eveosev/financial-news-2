MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX)  rose the
most in almost two months after an analyst at Bank of America
Corp. predicted a “limited pick up” of earnings because of
more profitable commercial-aerospace work.  MTU gained as much as 3 percent to 69.91 euros, the biggest
intraday increase since July 4, and was trading up 1.3 percent
at 11:58 a.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the manufacturer at 3.57
billion euros ($4.74 billion). The trading volume was 63 percent
of the three-month daily average.  Margins at the Munich-based company are likely to recover
as commercial new-engine volume will “grow strongly” this
year, Celine Fornaro, a London-based analyst at Bank of America
who raised her recommendation on MTU to neutral from
underperform, wrote in a research report. Chief Financial
Officer Reiner Winkler’s appointment to succeed Chief Executive
Officer Egon Behle by the end of this year “may lead to new
initiatives.”  Fornaro raised her share-price estimate to 70 euros from 64
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
