China  National Petroleum Corp. and
China Petrochemical Corp., the nation’s biggest oil and gas
producers, had their new refining and chemical projects
suspended after failing to meet the government’s 2012 pollutant
reduction targets.  They can’t seek environmental reviews of new or expansion
projects, except for ones that aim to upgrade oil quality or
reduce emissions, the Ministry of Environmental Protection said
in a  statement  posted to its website today, without providing a
list of projects. China is toughening its stance on  oil
companies  and their emissions to combat the nation’s worsening
pollution.  The ministry will assess the companies’ measures to improve
emissions in the first half before the suspensions can be lifted,
it said.  China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec Group, failed to meet
the target on nitrogen oxides emissions, and CNPC failed in
chemical oxygen demand, according to the statement. Those
measures are used to test pollutant levels in air or water.  Six other state-owned companies chosen for the tests,
including Shenhua Group Corp. and China Huaneng Group Corp., met
all emission targets, the ministry said.  Sinopec Group accepted the suspension and will invest more
money to upgrade equipment to meet the environmental
requirements, spokesman Lv Dapeng said in an e-mailed statement
today. Over the next three years, it will spend 22.9 billion
 yuan  ($3.7 billion) on 803 improvement projects, according to
the statement.  Four Fail  Lv said four subsidiaries in the provinces of Henan, Anhui,
Sichuan and  Shanghai  failed to meet emission standards.
Sinopec’s other units, which number about 120, have all met the
targets, Lv said.  CNPC will push its units to reduce pollution and meet the
target set in the five-year plan ending 2015, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing an unidentified
company official.  Two calls to the press office of the ministry in Beijing
seeking comment went unanswered today.  CNPC is the parent of Hong Kong-traded  PetroChina Co. (857) ,
which dropped the most in two years yesterday after four top
executives were removed because of government investigations.
Sinopec Group is the parent of Hong Kong-traded  China Petroleum
& Chemical Corp. (386) , known as Sinopec.  PetroChina gained 1.8 percent to HK$8.42 in  Hong Kong ,
while Sinopec dropped 0.7 percent to HK$5.69. The city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index  gained 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
