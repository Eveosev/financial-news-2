Italian business confidence
increased for a fourth month amid optimism on the efforts by
Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s cabinet to revive the euro
region’s third-biggest economy.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  rose to to 92.9 in August
from a revised 91.8 in July, Rome-based national statistics
institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted a reading
of 92, according to the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey . The index is based on a poll of about 4,000
businesses.  Italy’s two-year long recession eased in the second quarter
amid gains in executives’ confidence. Gross domestic product
contracted 0.2 percent from the previous three months when it
fell 0.6 percent. Still, that compares with a return to growth
in the wider euro area in the second quarter.  Consumer
confidence  also rose this month, Istat reported earlier today.  Italian industrial output increased in June, indicating the
country could emerge later this year from its longest slump
since World War II.  In an effort to lighten the tax burden on households,
Letta’s cabinet yesterday passed the cancellation for 2013 of an
unpopular property levy on main residences.  Istat originally reported the business confidence index at
91.7 in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
