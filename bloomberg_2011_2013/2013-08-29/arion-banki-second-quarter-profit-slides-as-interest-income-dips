Arion Banki hf, the state-owned
successor of failed Kaupthing Banki hf, said second-quarter
profit slid 34 percent as interest income fell.  Net earnings attributable to shareholders fell to 4.4
billion kronur ($36.7 million) from 6.7 billion kronur a year
earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank said today in a statement. Net
operating income slumped 14 percent to 12 billion kronur, while
interest income dropped 17 percent to 6.4 billion kronur.  “Despite a good return in the second quarter the financial
statements for the first six months are impacted by the bank’s
results in the first quarter, which was under expectation,”
Chief Executive Officer Hoskuldur H. Olafsson said in the
statement. The lower-than-expected return was due to “the
developments of the currency and one-time costs at the bank’s
subsidiary.”  Arion’s capital-adequacy ratio was 24.3 percent of its
risk-weighted assets at the end of June, the lender said.
Icelandic law requires banks to have a capital buffer of no less
than 8 percent, although the Financial Supervisory Authority can
require lenders to have a higher ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
