Barcelona won a record-extending
11th Spanish Super Cup title on away goals even after  Lionel Messi  missed a penalty in a 0-0 draw against Atletico Madrid.  Four-time world player of the year Messi hit the crossbar
with his 89th-minute effort at Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium last
night to keep the second match of the two-game series scoreless.
Last week’s opener in the Spanish capital finished 1-1.  Barcelona, which secured its fourth Super Cup in the past
five years, became the first team to win the contest between the
Spanish league title holder and the Copa del Rey champion
without a victory in either of the two games. It’s Gerardo Martino’s first trophy as coach of Barca.  Barca goalkeeper  Victor Valdes  saved shots from David Villa
and Arda Turan, who was shown the red-card despite having
already been substituted, for protesting against the decision to
award the penalty. Atletico’s Filipe Luis was sent off with nine
minutes remaining for swinging an arm at  Dani Alves .  To contact the reporter on this story:
