Canada’s housing agency said its net
income after taxes rose to C$446 million ($424 million) in the
second quarter.  Net income rose 35 percent in the three months ended June
30, while the outstanding balance of  mortgage insurance  fell
less than 1 percent to C$562 billion, Canada Mortgage & Housing
Corp. said today in a financial report on its  website .  CMHC will inform financial institutions soon about
individual caps on the amount of mortgage-backed securities the
agency will guarantee, Wojo Zielonka, CMHC’s vice president of
capital markets in Ottawa, told reporters on a conference call
after the report was released.  Government-owned CMHC guarantees pools of mortgages that
financial institutions repackage as securities sold to
investors. The Canadian government, rated AAA by  Standard &
Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service Inc., backs the CMHC
guarantee.  CMHC said this month it will ration the amount of the
securities it guarantees. The agency’s move may increase
 mortgage rates  charged by Canada’s largest banks by between 15
and 45 basis points, National Bank Financial Inc. analyst  Peter Routledge  said in an Aug. 5 research note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
