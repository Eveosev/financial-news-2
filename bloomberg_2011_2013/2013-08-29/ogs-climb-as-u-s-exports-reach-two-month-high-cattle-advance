Hog futures rallied to the highest
in more than a week as overseas demand for U.S. pork climbed.
Cattle prices also rose.  Export  sales  of pork totaled 12,556 metric tons in the week
ended Aug. 22, up 78 percent from a week earlier and the highest
since June 20, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed today.
Meatpackers processed 1.293 million hogs in the first three days
of this week, up 0.5 percent from a week earlier, according to
government figures.  “You do have some demand picking up,” Christian Mayer, a
market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “I would not be
surprised if we were seeing some overseas demand helping this
market out.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 0.9 percent to
86.8 cents a pound at 10:43 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 86.975 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since Aug. 20.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$1.273 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for October
settlement added 0.2 percent to $1.5795 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
