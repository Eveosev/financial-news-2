Aaron Finch smashed a world record
156 to lead  Australia  to a 39-run win against  England  in the
first of two Twenty20 cricket matches between the teams.  Finch, 26, broke the previous record for the highest
individual score in a Twenty20 international of 123, set by New
Zealand’s Brendon McCullum against  Bangladesh  in September. The
right-hander smashed 14 sixes, another record, and 11 fours from
63 balls in posting the  10th century  in elite Twenty20 matches.  “It was just one of those days where it hit the middle of
the bat and things went my way,” Finch said in a televised
interview. “The wicket was flat and it made it easier for
stroke play. It was a beautiful place to bat. I’m not sure the
bowlers will be too happy about it though.”  Shane Watson  added 37 runs and Shaun Marsh made 28 as
Australia posted 248-6, the second-highest Twenty20
international total, after being put into bat at the  Rose Bowl 
in Southampton last night. Joe Root hit an unbeaten 90 as
England finished on 209-6 in reply, its second-highest score in
the 20-overs-per-side game.  The victory was Australia’s first in any format since Feb.
10, when it completed a 5-0 one-day series sweep of the West
Indies. Its Test team lost 4-0 in India and 3-0 in the Ashes
series in England, while it also failed to win a match at June’s
Champions Trophy.  The second Twenty20 match is tomorrow at Chester-le-Street
before the teams start a five-game one-day series on Sept. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
