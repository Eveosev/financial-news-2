U.K. stocks  rose, snapping two days
of losses, as data showed the  U.S. economy  grew more in the
second quarter than forecast, and  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  said it is
in talks to sell its stake in a joint venture to partner  Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ)   Vodafone soared to its highest price since 2002.  WPP (WPP)  Plc
rallied 4.2 percent after first-half revenue beat analysts’
estimates.  Melrose Industries Plc (MRO)  rose 6.1 percent after first-half sales more than doubled from a year earlier.  Serco Group
Plc (SRP)  slid the most in 11 years as the U.K. government said it
found evidence of potential fraud by the services company’s
staff members in managing a prisoner-escort contract.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  climbed 52.99 points, or 0.8 percent, to
6,483.05 at the close in  London . The gauge  has advanced  7.5
percent from a low on June 24 and is trading at 12.6 times
estimated earnings, compared with a 2009 high of 15 times,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also gained 0.8 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index added 2 percent.  “We’re seeing a good share-price development for Vodafone
today, after the news about Verizon,” said Peter Braendle, a
Zurich-based portfolio manager who helps oversee about $60
million, including Vodafone shares, at Swisscanto Asset
Management. “If the price is attractive, the stake sale is very
much a good thing. I’m also positive about U.K. stocks because
the U.K. economy seems to find its way out of sluggish growth
and valuations are not yet demanding.”  U.S. Data  In the U.S., revised Commerce Department data showed the
world’s biggest economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annualized
pace in the second quarter, compared with the 2.2 percent-pace
predicted by economists in a Bloomberg survey. The initial
reading was for a 1.7 percent rate.  A separate report showed applications for  jobless benefits 
fell by 6,000 to 331,000 last week, from a revised 337,000 the
week before that was higher than initially reported. Economists
in a separate survey had forecast a drop to 332,000.  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
was 43 percent higher than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Vodafone jumped 8.2 percent to 204.75 pence. The world’s
second-biggest wireless operator said it is in talks with
Verizon to sell its 45 percent stake in  Verizon Wireless . The
deal may be valued at $130 billion, said two people familiar
with the matter. That would make it the biggest transaction
since Vodafone’s acquisition of Mannesmann AG in 2000.  WPP Gains  WPP rallied 4.2 percent to 1,227 pence after saying first-half revenue rose to 5.33 billion pounds ($8.27 billion),
exceeding the 5.29 billion-pound average estimated by analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Sales will increase more than 3 percent
this year, the world’s largest advertising company said.  Melrose climbed 6.1 percent to 301.8 pence, its highest
price since at least 2003, as it said first-half adjusted profit
before tax rose to 139.4 million pounds from 65.9 million pounds
a year earlier, after its purchase of Elster Group SE. The
 investment company  focused on engineering firms agreed to buy
Elster for $2.3 billion in June 2012.  “With the excellent progress achieved at Elster and
substantial  shareholder value  being created from disposals, 2013
is looking like it could be a very successful year,” Melrose
Chairman Christopher Miller said in a statement.  Serco Slides  Serco slid 11 percent to 538.5 pence. The services company
and the U.K.’s Ministry of Justice asked the  City of London 
police to investigate discrepancies in Serco’s records of
performance related to a contract that included transporting
prisoners. Serco said its board members had no knowledge of
misreporting. Separately, it posted first-half pretax profit
that missed analyst forecasts.  “Unless it undertakes a rapid process of major change, and
becomes completely open with government about the work it is
doing for us, then it will not win public contracts in future,”
Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling said of Serco.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  plunged 19 percent to 102.25 pence as the
producer of gold in Russia reported a first-half net loss of
$742.2 million, compared with a profit of $11 million a year
earlier, saying lower  gold prices  led to writedowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
