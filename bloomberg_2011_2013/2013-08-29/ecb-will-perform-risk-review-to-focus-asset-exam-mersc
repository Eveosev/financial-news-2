The European Central Bank will
identify areas which it considers particularly risky ahead of
its upcoming bank asset quality review, according to ECB
Executive Board member Yves Mersch.  The “comprehensive assessment” prescribed by the European
Union law establishing the ECB as the overseer of the banking
supervision in the euro area will allow it to address legacy
assets and will result in determining possible capital needs at
the banks under its scope, Mersch said today in a speech in
Alpbach,  Austria .  “As we see the comprehensive assessment, it would be
composed of three elements,” Mersch said. “The first would be
a risk assessment where we would try to define what are the
portfolios that contain the most risk and which are the
portfolios that will be screened more thoroughly during the
balance sheet assessment.”  The identification of the areas that need attention will
then be followed by the balance sheet assessment itself, which
again would be succeeded by a stress test conducted together
with the European Banking Authority, Mersch said.  “All three elements are part of one process and at the end
there will be one single figure of capital needs if there is a
capital need,” according to Mersch.  To contact the reporters on this story:
