Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest lender by assets, hired  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  Vice President
Zhou Bo for its investment banking team to help cover natural-resources clients in China.  Zhou, who is based in  Hong Kong , will join the London-based
bank as a vice president in late October, Angie Tang, a Barclays
spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail today. Three calls to Zhou’s
mobile phone went straight to voicemail.  Zhou studied for a masters of business administration at
the  University of Michigan  and a science degree from Zhejiang
University, according to Barclays. His father is Zhou Jiping,
who was named in April as chairman of China National Petroleum
Corp., the nation’s largest oil producer, three people with
knowledge of the matter said.  “We are convinced that people who join us come with a
track record and proven technical skills from their prior
experience” in  investment banking , wrote Tang, who is based in
Hong Kong. Barclays hires people “with a strong technical
background,” she said.  Barclays helped arrange a $2 billion bond sale for CNPC in
April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The lender
advised on a December transaction where PetroChina Co., a CNPC
unit, bought a 49.9 percent stake in an Alberta shale-gas
project from Encana Corp.  Candice Sun, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at Deutsche
Bank, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
