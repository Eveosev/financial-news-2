Israel’s two largest lenders,  Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  and  Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI)  Ltd., posted higher
second-quarter profit as provisions for bad loans declined.  Bank Leumi net rose 69 percent to 474 million shekels ($131
million) as provisions to cover bad loans dropped 75 percent to
84 million shekels, the country’s second-biggest lender said in
an e-mailed statement. Net income at the largest competitor
Hapoalim increased eight percent to 655 million shekels as
provisions fell 13 percent to 301 million shekels, the bank said
in an e-mailed statement.  “Credit quality is improving because corporates are
deleveraging,” Terence Klingman, head of research at Psagot
Investment House Ltd., said today by phone from Tel Aviv. Leumi
profit fell short of Psagot’s forecast of 556 million shekels
while Hapoalim surpassed the 617-million shekel estimate.  Restructurings at holding companies such as  IDB Holding
Corp. (IDBH)  and tougher capital adequacy directives from the  Bank of
Israel  are forcing banks to pare lending to corporations.
Lending to households is increasing as the nation’s economic
growth jumped to 5.1 percent in the second quarter, compared
with a 3 percent median estimate of eight economists surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Leumi benefited from a 25 percent rise in non-interest
income to 1.25 billion shekels, it said.  Israel Discount Bank
Ltd. (DSCT) , the nation’s third-largest, said yesterday  second-quarter
profit  rose 59 percent to 263 million shekels as non-interest
income rose to 236 million shekels from 37 million shekels in
the same period a year earlier.  Hapoalim said return on equity was 9.9 percent while Leumi
reported a 7.6 percent return. Leumi shares rose 1.5 percent to
11.77 shekels as of 10:57 a.m. in  Tel Aviv  while Hapoalim gained
2 percent to 16.58 shekels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
