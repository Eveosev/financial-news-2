Research firm IDC cut its forecast
for tablet-computer sales through 2017 as larger smartphones and
wearable technology, such as  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Glass, compete for
consumers’ attention.  Tablet shipments will reach 227.4 million this year, down
0.8 percent from an earlier forecast, IDC said today in a
 statement . The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company reduced
its 2017 forecast by 0.7 percent to 407 million.  Google is betting that Glass, its Web-enabled eyeglasses,
will substitute some of the tasks users now handle with tablets
and smartphones, such as getting directions or doing video
chats. Smartphone makers such as Samsung Electronics Co.,
meanwhile, have introduced devices with screens as  large  as 6.3
inches (16 centimeters) diagonally, approaching the 7.9-inch
size of tablets such as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s  iPad Mini .  IDC also boosted its forecast for the portion of tablet
shipments that will go to emerging markets. Regions including
Asia, Latin America, central and eastern Europe, the Middle East
and Africa will get 51 percent of shipments in 2017, IDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
