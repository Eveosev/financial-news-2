Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  said Kathleen Taylor will take over as chairman in 2014, making her the first
woman to lead the board of one of the nation’s biggest lenders.  David O’Brien, 71, will retire at the end of the year and
remain on the board until the company’s annual general meeting
on Feb. 26, Toronto-based RBC,  Canada ’s largest bank, said
yesterday in a statement.  “I appreciate the confidence of the board and look forward
to building on the bank’s achievements together,” Taylor, 56,
said in the statement.  Women serve as chairman, or equivalent role, at 10 publicly
listed Canadian firms with market values of at least C$500
million ($474.6 million), data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Taylor will be the first to lead one of the nation’s banks, RBC
said. In 2011, Beth Mooney took over as chairman and chief
executive officer of Cleveland-based  KeyCorp (KEY) , becoming the first
woman to lead one of the 20 biggest independent U.S. banks.  Taylor, the former CEO of Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts,
has been on RBC’s board since 2001, according to the bank.  RBC said in a separate statement that Chief Risk Officer
Morten Friis will retire on Jan. 10 after more than three
decades at the firm. He will be succeeded by  Mark Hughes , chief
operating officer of  RBC Capital Markets , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
