Australian business investment rose
last quarter as stronger mining spending outweighed a decline in
manufacturing.  Capital spending  gained 4 percent from the first quarter,
when it fell a revised 4.1 percent, the Bureau of Statistics
said in Sydney today. That compares with the median forecast for
no change in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  Governor  Glenn Stevens  and his
board slashed borrowing costs by 2.25 percentage points over the
past 22 months to 2.5 percent to foster a transition to
industries including residential construction as resource
investment wanes. Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd , who has called the
end of Australia’s China-led mining boom, has set an election
for Sept. 7 framed around economic management.  “The  capital spending  numbers confirm mining investment
isn’t headed for a sharp decline in coming quarters,” Katrina
Ell, an economist at Moody’s Analytics in Sydney, said before
the release. “It’s good news for the broader economy.”  Today’s report showed Australian companies forecast
investment of A$160.5 billion in the year ended June 30, 2013,
which was 1.4 percent lower than their estimate three months
earlier. They predicted investment of A$159.2 billion in
2013-14, which was 2.3 percent higher than their estimate three
months earlier. Australian mining investment in 2013-14 is
projected at A$102.8 billion, compared with A$101.5 billion
three months earlier.  The local dollar was little changed after the report,
buying 89.69 U.S. cents at 11:37 a.m. in Sydney.  Rate Cuts  Traders are pricing in a 59 percent chance that the RBA
will cut its benchmark rate to a fresh record of 2.25 percent by
the end of the year,  interest-rate swaps  data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The odds of a reduction at the next policy
meeting Sept. 3 are less than 10 percent.  Today’s report showed spending on buildings and structures
rose 7.1 percent last quarter. Company investment in new plant
and equipment declined 1.2 percent, it showed.  The Australian dollar slumped 12 percent in the second
quarter, the biggest slide worldwide behind the Syrian pound,
after holding above $1 from mid-June last year to May 9, the
longest stretch above parity since it was freely floated in
1983.  The central bank in August reduced its forecast for gross
domestic product growth this year to 2.25 percent from an
earlier prediction of 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
