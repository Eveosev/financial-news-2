Hong Kong  stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index advancing the first time in three days, as
energy shares gained on concern possible U.S. military action in
 Syria  may disrupt the flow of oil from the Middle East. China
Life Insurance Co. gained on a first-half jump in profit.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose 0.6 percent to 21,658.71 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, rebounding from the biggest decline
since Aug. 20. About five shares rose for each that fell on the
50-member gauge, which is headed for an 1.1 percent monthly drop
amid expected cuts to U.S. stimulus next month. The Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index today added 1.3 percent to 9,888.98.  Hong Kong’s equity benchmark retreated 5 percent this year
through yesterday, the second-worst performer among developed
markets tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge traded at 10.3 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 14.8 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.6 on the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, dropped 20 percent through yesterday from a Feb. 1
high on concern over China’s economy after a two-quarter
slowdown in growth. The measure traded at 1.18 times book value
yesterday, compared with a five-year average of 1.77.  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent. The measure
rebounded yesterday from an eight-week low as energy shares
surged after crude rose to a two-year high. The U.S. and the
U.K. yesterday said they are prepared to take military action
against Syria without authorization from the United Nations
Security Council over that nation’s alleged used of chemical
weapons against its own people.  A report today may show the U.S. economy grew more last
quarter than previously estimated, adding to expectations the
Federal Reserve may start curtailing bond purchases next month.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg project gross domestic product
expanded 2.2 percent in the second quarter, up from the earlier
official forecast of 1.7 percent.  Speculation the Fed will taper stimulus has weighed on
equities in recent weeks. The central bank is expected to pare
asset purchases in September by $10 billion to a $75 billion
monthly pace, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg on
Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
