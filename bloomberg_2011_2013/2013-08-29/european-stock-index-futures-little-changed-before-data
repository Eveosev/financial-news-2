European stocks  rose, erasing their
monthly loss, as Vodafone Group Plc surged to an 11-year high
while data showed the U.S. economy grew faster than forecast in
the second quarter and a drop in jobless claims beat estimates.  Vodafone jumped 8.2 percent after saying Verizon
Communications Inc. is in talks to acquire its stake in their
Verizon Wireless venture. Carrefour SA rallied the most in seven
months after posting an increase in first-half profit. Zurich
Insurance Group AG declined 2.5 percent as Chairman  Josef Ackermann  resigned.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.8 percent to 300.13. The
gauge lost 2.2 percent in the past three days, closing yesterday
at a six-week low, on concern the U.S. will take military action
against  Syria . Secretary of State  John Kerry  this week said
America will hold Syria accountable for the chemical-weapon
attacks that opposition groups say killed as many as 1,300.  “I don’t think the  Syria crisis  will have that strong an
impact on the markets on a longer-term horizon,” Tobias Britsch, who helps oversee $33 billion as European equities
asset manager at Meriten Investment Management GmbH, said by
telephone from Dusseldorf,  Germany . “Over a six-to-12-month
horizon, I’m quite optimistic for equity markets. We’re not out
of the woods, but we’re in a better place than we were.”  Growth, Unemployment  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate in
the second quarter, Commerce Department figures showed. That
compared with the initial estimate of 1.7 percent and
economists’ median estimate of a 2.2 percent gain. A separate
report showed applications for  jobless benefits  fell by 6,000 to
331,000 last week from a revised 337,000 in the prior week.  The prospect of imminent military action against Syria
weakened as the U.K. and  France  said they prefer waiting for the
results of a United Nations investigation into alleged use of
chemical weapons by President Bashar al-Assad’s government
against its citizens. The U.S., which says it has evidence his
administration was responsible, will not act without allies,
according to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.  National benchmark indexes gained in all of the western
European markets except Iceland and  Switzerland . The U.K.’s FTSE
100 rallied 0.8 percent, while France’s CAC 40 climbed 0.7
percent. Germany’s DAX advanced 0.5 percent.  Vodafone Deal  Vodafone (VOD)  surged 8.2 percent to 204.75 pence, its highest
price since January 2002. Europe’s biggest wireless carrier said
it is in talks with Verizon to sell its 45 percent stake in
their Verizon Wireless venture.  The transaction may be valued at $130 billion, people with
knowledge of the matter said. At that price, the  deal  would be
the biggest since Vodafone’s acquisition of Mannesmann AG in
2000 and would give the U.K. carrier’s finances a boost as it
tries to revive operations hurt by Europe’s debt crisis.  A gauge of telecommunications stocks rallied the most since
August 2011, posting the best performance among the 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600.  Carrefour (CA)  rose 5.6 percent to 24.06 euros, for its biggest
gain since Jan. 17. France’s largest retailer reported a 4.9
percent increase in first-half profit. Recurring operating
income jumped to 766 million euros ($1.02 billion), in line with
the median analyst estimate of 767 million euros.  Melrose, WPP  Melrose Industries Plc (MRO)  advanced 6.1 percent to 301.8 pence,
its highest price since it sold shares to the public in October
2003. The owner of Brush Turbogenerators said first-half sales
more than doubled from a year earlier.  WPP Plc climbed 4.2 percent to 1,227 pence, its highest
price since March 2000. The world’s largest advertising company
said first-half sales increased 7.1 percent on stronger growth
in the U.K. and  North America , helping counter a slowdown in
Asia and  Africa .  Baloise Holding AG (BALN)  gained 2.5 percent to 100.10 Swiss
francs. Switzerland’s third-biggest insurer said first-half  net
income  rose to 244.8 million francs ($265 million), from 218.3
million francs in the year-before period. The company also said
it is on track to meet its financial targets.  Zurich Insurance declined 2.5 percent to 228.80 francs.
Ackermann is resigning from the board with immediate effect
after the company’s finance chief Pierre Wauthier committed
suicide. He will be replaced by Vice Chairman Tom de Swaan.  “The unexpected death of Pierre Wauthier has deeply
shocked me,” Ackermann said in a statement. “I have reasons to
believe that the family is of the opinion that I should take my
share of responsibility, as unfounded as any allegations might
be.”  Vienna Insurance Group AG lost 3.4 percent to 39.49 euros.
Austria’s biggest insurer reported second-quarter pretax profit
of 46.3 million euros, falling short of the average analyst
estimate of 67.8 million euros.  Serco Group Plc tumbled 11 percent to 538.5 pence for its
biggest drop since July 2002. The U.K. government said police
are investigating suspected fraud by Serco staff in a contract
for prisoner escorting and custodial services. The Ministry of
Justice gave the company three months to improve governance and
said the company may be excluded from all government contracts
if it failed to do so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
