Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run home
run and Todd Redmond ended a run of seven starts without a win
as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees 7-2.  The Blue Jays took the series at Rogers Centre in Toronto
by two games to one to improve to 60-74 this season. The Yankees
are 70-63, 5 1/2 games back in the race for one of the American
League’s two wild-card playoff berths.  Redmond, Toronto’s starting pitcher, got the win for the
first time since July 7 after giving up two runs on three hits
and striking out seven in 5 2/3 innings. New York’s Hiroki Kuroda surrendered seven runs for the second straight Major
League Baseball outing, tying his career high as he took the
loss for the fourth time in five starts.  Toronto had a 4-0 lead after the first inning and extended
the advantage to 7-0 through three innings.  A two-run double by Brett Lawrie opened the scoring and
Rajai Davis and Lawrie then scored on a throwing error by
Yankees catcher Chris Stewart. Encarnacion added his two-run
shot in the second inning and J.P Arencibia scored on Jose Reyes’s sacrifice fly in the third. Five of the runs allowed by
Kuroda were earned.  The Yankees got both their runs in the fourth, on a single
from Alex Rodriguez and a double by Mark Reynolds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
