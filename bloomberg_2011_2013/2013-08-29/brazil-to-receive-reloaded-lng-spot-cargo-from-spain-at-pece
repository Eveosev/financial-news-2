Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Brazil ’s
importer of liquefied natural gas, is set to receive a reloaded
spot cargo from  Spain , shipping data show.  The Wilgas, with a capacity of about 127,000 cubic meters,
is en route to Pecem, according to transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. It was scheduled to dock Aug. 26, the
data show. State-owned Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras,
has a floating regasification terminal at the port in
northeastern Brazil.  The vessel sailed from SAGGAS Planta de Regasificacion de
Sagunto SA’s Sagunto terminal in eastern Spain, where it loaded
the supercooled natural gas from storage and departed on Aug.
16, the data show. Spain doesn’t produce LNG.  Brazil doesn’t have long-term LNG supply contracts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Rio de Janeiro-based
Petrobras will import as many as 60 cargoes this year, up from
56 in 2012, the company said June 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
