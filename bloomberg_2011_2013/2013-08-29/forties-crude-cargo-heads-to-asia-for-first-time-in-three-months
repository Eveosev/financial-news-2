A very large crude carrier has been
chartered to load North Sea Forties crude on Sept. 21 to Sept.
23 for  South Korea , the first shipment to  Asia  in more than
three months, according to reports from shipbrokers.  The supertanker Marbat was fixed by Glencore Xstrata Plc’s
ST Shipping, the reports showed, including one from Optima
Shipbrokers Ltd. in Athens. The VLCC will be the first to carry
Forties to Asia since June 11, when the Maersk Sandra departed
from a loading terminal Hound Point in  Scotland  for Daesan,
South Korea.  The tanker will probably sail to China instead of South
Korea, said three of seven traders who participate in the North
Sea crude market, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. A fourth trader said the vessel
would be sailing East, while the rest said the original
destination may change.  South Korean refiners have cut imports from the  North Sea 
this year after the country’s government made tax changes
reducing the benefit they get from buying crude from the region.  Forties is one of the four grades used to price Dated
Brent, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
