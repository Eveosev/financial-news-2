Landsbankinn hf, the state-owned
successor of failed Landsbanki Islands hf, said second-quarter
profit rose 82 percent on fee and commission income and
adjustments to loans and advances acquired at a discount.  Net income climbed to 7.5 billion kronur ($62.5 million)
from 4.1 billion kronur a year earlier, the Reykjavik-based bank
said today in a  statement .  “Landsbankinn’s operations are stable and in line with
current objectives,” Chief Executive Officer Steinthor Palsson
said in the statement. “The bank’s results are quite
satisfactory, in our opinion, and we have made great inroads
towards lowering operating expenses.”  Net operating income surged more than fourfold to 2.8
billion kronur and net interest income slumped 29 percent to 7.1
billion kronur. Loans and receivables valuations were a net 3.3
billion kronur, up from being valued at a loss of 1.5 billion
kronur a year earlier.  Landsbankinn’s capital-adequacy ratio was 25.9 percent of
its risk-weighted assets at the end of June, the lender said.
The Financial Supervisory Authority requires Landsbankinn to
have a capital buffer of no less than 19.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
