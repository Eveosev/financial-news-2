Mexico ’s IPC equity benchmark
dropped for a seventh day, the worst stretch of losses since
2009, as concern mounted that slowing economic growth will crimp
corporate earnings.  Soda bottlers Coca-Cola Femsa SAB and Arca Continental SAB
slid 1.3 percent and 2.7 percent while Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB,
Latin America’s biggest retailer, retreated 1.8 percent.
Precious-metals miner Minera Frisco SAB fell 6.4 percent.  The index of 35  stocks  slipped 0.2 percent to 39,162.49 at
the close in Mexico City, posting its longest losing streak
since a nine-day drop in January 2009. The plunge began after
the statistics bureau reported on Aug. 20 that the economy
expanded less than economists forecast in the second quarter and
the government cut its 2013 growth forecast to 1.8 percent from
a previous projection of 3.1 percent.  “The weak performance of the economy has had an impact,”
 Gerardo Copca , an analyst at Metanalisis SA, said by phone from
Mexico City. “You have to adjust your expectations for lower
sales and profits.”  Mexico’s IPC is down 6.4 percent in seven days, compared
with a 1.3 percent drop during the period for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
