San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the  Philippines ’
biggest company, will join forces with Korea Water Resources
Corp. to acquire the 218-megawatt Angat hydroelectric plant near
the capital Manila.  San Miguel expects to sign a definitive agreement with the
Daijon-based utility, it said today in a stock exchange filing.
State-owned Power Sector Assets & Liabilities Management Corp.
is set to issue a “certificate of effectivity” for the project
in favor of Korea Water, according to the statement.  San Miguel said July 29 it was in talks with the Korean
utility on teaming up to own and operate the plant in Bulacan
province, 58 kilometers (36 miles) north of Manila.  Korea Water submitted the highest bid for the facility in
2010, offering the government $440.9 million. The Philippine
Supreme Court halted the award in May that year before upholding
its validity last October. The plant is fueled by the Angat dam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
