Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s largest
aerospace manufacturer, predicts global airlines will need to
hire 498,000 new pilots to keep pace with aircraft orders over
the next 20 years, 8.3 percent more than it forecast a year ago.  The hiring will be greatest among Asian carriers, which
will need to recruit 192,300 pilots through 2032, Chicago-based
Boeing said in a study released today. That’s 3.6 percent more
than the planemaker predicted in its 2012 forecast.  Pilot training among the region’s rapidly growing carriers
has been in the spotlight as U.S. crash investigators examine
the manual flying skills and cockpit teamwork of pilots guiding
an Asiana Airlines Inc. jet that crashed in  San Francisco  in
July.  “The urgent demand for competent aviation personnel is a
global issue that is here now and is very real,” Sherry Carbary, vice president of Boeing Flight Services, said in a
statement.  The report comes as Boeing opens its training center for
pilots of its 787 Dreamliner today at Miami’s international
airport. The transfer of the training center from the Seattle
area will result in the loss of about 34 union jobs, said Bill Dugovich, spokesman for the 26,000-member Professional Aerospace
Union, known as SPEEA.  Boeing predicts airlines will hire 556,000 maintenance
technicians over the next two decades, 7.5 percent fewer than a
year ago, as carriers retire aging aircraft in favor of new
models that require fewer overhauls.  To contact the reporters on this story:
