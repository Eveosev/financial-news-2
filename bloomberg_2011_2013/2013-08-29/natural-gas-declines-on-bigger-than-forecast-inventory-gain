Natural gas futures fell in New York
after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles expanded
last week by more than forecast.  Gas dropped as much as 1.7 percent after the Energy
Information Administration said inventories rose 67 billion
cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 23 to 3.13 trillion cubic
feet. Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
gain of 62 billion. A survey of Bloomberg users predicted an
increase of 61 billion.  “This was a high number by any way you slice it,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of Schork Group Inc.,  a consulting
group in Villanova,  Pennsylvania  “We are simply not getting
sufficient weather to really cut into the supply surplus.”  Natural gas for October delivery declined 4.8 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $3.534 per million British thermal units at 10:37
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Gas traded at $3.628
before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. Volume was 6.8
percent below the 100-day average.  The stockpile increase was bigger than the five-year
average gain for the week of 66 billion cubic feet, EIA data
show. A  surplus  to the five-year average was unchanged from a
week earlier 1.5 percent. Supplies were 7 percent below year-earlier inventories, compared with 7.2 percent in last week’s
report.  Milder Weather  Unusually hot weather sweeping the lower 48 states over the
next five days will give way to below-normal readings across
most of the East Coast and Midwest from Sept. 3 through Sept.
12, MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said.  The high in  New York City  on Sept. 6 may be 73 degrees
Fahrenheit (23 Celsius), 6 less than average, and  Chicago  may be
6 lower than the norm at 74 degrees, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand.  Gas inventories may peak at 3.8 trillion cubic feet at the
end of October, before the start of the peak-demand season for
the heating and power-plant fuel, the EIA said in its Aug. 6
 Short-Term Energy Outlook . Supplies rose to an all-time high of
3.929 trillion cubic feet on Nov. 2, 2012.  The government cut its 2013 marketed gas production
estimate to 69.89 billion cubic feet a day in the outlook from
last month’s forecast of 69.96 billion. Output, heading higher
for the sixth straight year, may increase 1 percent from 2012 as
new wells are connected at shale deposits such as the Marcellus
in the Northeast, the EIA said.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA.  To contact the reporters on this story:
