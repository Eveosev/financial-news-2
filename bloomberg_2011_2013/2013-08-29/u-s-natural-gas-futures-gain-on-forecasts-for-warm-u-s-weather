Natural gas futures gained for a
fourth day in  New York  before a government report that may show
a smaller-than-average U.S. inventory increase.  Gas rose much as 1.5 percent as the Energy Information
Administration may say stockpiles rose 62 billion cubic feet
last week, based on the median of 25  analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. The five-year average gain for the period is 66
billion. Above-normal U.S. temperatures this week will give way
to cooler readings in the East next week, according to MDA
Weather Services.  “Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for another
storage number to come out,” said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America LLC in
Miami. “People are looking for the low 60s; that’s already
priced in the market. The market has a little bit of a bearish
feel to it because of a lack of significant weather and because
we are on track for ample storage at the end of the season.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 1.3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $3.595 per million British thermal units at 9:08
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 4.3
percent below the 100-day average. Prices have climbed 7.3
percent this year.  The EIA, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, is
scheduled to release its weekly gas supply report at 10:30 a.m.
in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
