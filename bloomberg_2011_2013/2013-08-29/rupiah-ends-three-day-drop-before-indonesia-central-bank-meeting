Indonesian stocks  gained the most in
seven weeks and the rupiah rose after the central bank raised
borrowing costs to the highest level since 2009 in an
unscheduled move.  Government bonds  rose.  The Jakarta Composite index  advanced 1.9 percent at the
close to 4,103.593, the most since July 11. The rupiah rose 0.1
percent to 10,935 per dollar as of 5:32 p.m. in Jakarta,
according to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. One-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.6 percent to 11,478, a
4.7 percent discount to the spot rate.  Bank  Indonesia  raised its  reference rate  by 50 basis points
to 7 percent, it said after a board of governors meeting today
that wasn’t part of the regular schedule of monthly policy
reviews. It increased its deposit facility rate, or Fasbi, by 50
basis points to 5.25 percent. The central bank extended a $12
billion bilateral swap deal with the  Bank of Japan , allowing the
two to borrow from each others’ foreign-exchange reserves,
spokesman Difi Johansyah said.  “It is aimed at preventing the rupiah currency from
falling too deeply,” Priyo Santoso, chief investment officer at
PT Mandiri Manajemen Investasi, said by phone from Jakarta.
“Overall, it is a very good policy by  Bank Indonesia  to bring
back investors’ confidence.”  PT Astra International, the largest company in the Jakarta
index by market capitalization, gained 4.5 percent. PT
Telekomunikasi Indonesia added 3.5 percent and PT Kalbe Farma
jumped 9.2 percent, the steepest increase since June 26.  Temporary Fix  The yield on government bonds due May 2023 dropped 14 basis
points to 8.73 percent, after earlier touching 8.87 percent, the
highest level since February 2011, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show.  A  fixing  used to settle the forwards set by the Association
of Banks in  Singapore  was at 11,294 today, the same level as
yesterday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, declined nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 19.83 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The rupiah appreciated slightly, but the reaction will
probably not be long-lasting,” said Khoon Goh, a senior
currency strategist at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  in Singapore. “The swap lines with  Japan  is not a lot in
the grand scheme of things, because Bank Indonesia has depleted
the reserves by so much that $12 billion could get exhausted in
a couple of months.”  Bank Indonesia’s foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $92.7
billion as of the end of July from $124.6 billion in August
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
expects inflation to pick up to between 9 percent and 9.8
percent by the end of this year, after reaching a four-year high
of 8.6 percent in July, it said.  “To see if there will be a reversal in the rupiah  exchange
rate , we will have to wait for economic data in the next one or
two months,” Alvin Pattisahusiwa, chief investment officer at
PT Manulife Asset Management in Jakarta, said by phone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
