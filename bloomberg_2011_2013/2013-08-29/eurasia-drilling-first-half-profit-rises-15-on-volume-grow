Eurasia Drilling Co.’s first half
profit increased 15 percent after  Russia ’s largest oilfield
services company completed more wells.  Net income rose to $217 million in the first six months of
the year from $189 million in the same period the previous year,
according to a statement by the Moscow-based company. Revenue
rose 7.6 percent to $1.7 billion.  Oil companies  in Russia, the world’s largest producer, have
boosted spending on drilling as depleting Soviet-era fields
require additional work to stem output declines. President
 Vladimir Putin  has pledged to hold oil production, the country’s
largest single tax earner, steady for decades.  “The Russian drilling market continued to expand in the
first half,” said Alexander Djaparidze, Eurasia chief executive
officer. “We are, therefore, optimistic for the rest of the
year and committed to delivering strong results in line with our
expectations.”  The oilfield services company is aiming for $3.6 billion in
sales for the full year, according to a January statement.  Drilling climbed 5.9 percent to 3.04 million meters (9.97
million feet) in the first half. Horizontal drilling increased
20 percent from the same period the previous year to 492,000
meters, accounting for 16 percent of total volumes, according to
the statement. Eurasia expects horizontal volumes to continue to
rise, Djaparidze said.  Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, increased 17 percent to $441 million,
with the Ebitda margin increasing to 26 percent from 23.9
percent in the same period the previous year, according to the
statement.  Capital expenditure in the first half fell to $179 million
from $282 million in the first six months of 2012, Eurasia
Drilling said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
