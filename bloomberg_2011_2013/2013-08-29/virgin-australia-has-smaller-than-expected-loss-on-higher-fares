Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. (VAH) , the
country’s second-largest carrier, had a smaller-than-expected
annual loss as the rollout of business class services across its
network helped support fares.  The net loss was A$98 million ($87 million) in the year
ended June 30, the Brisbane-based company said today in a
regulatory statement. That was narrower than the A$102 million
average of five  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg, and
compares with a A$23 million profit  a year earlier .  The carrier has taken about A$105 million in one-time costs
as it took over smaller rivals, installed business-class seats
and moves to a new ticketing system to take on Qantas Airways
Ltd.’s 65 percent share of the Australian market. Qantas
yesterday announced a return to profit as it reduced long-haul
losses after canceling some unprofitable routes and tying up
with Dubai’s Emirates.  “There is already evidence of revenue conditions
improving,” Simon Mitchell, an analyst at UBS AG in Sydney,
wrote in a note to clients on Aug. 6. Sales should “expand at a
far greater pace than costs” in the year ending June 2014, he
said.  Virgin rose 3.9 percent to 40.5 Australian cents in Sydney
yesterday. The stock has dropped 3.6 percent this year, compared
with a 9.5 percent gain in the S&P/ASX 200 index.  Last year’s capacity growth of 6.3 percent will slow to 3
percent to 4 percent in the six months ending December, the
company said Aug. 5, a shift that usually lifts ticket prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
