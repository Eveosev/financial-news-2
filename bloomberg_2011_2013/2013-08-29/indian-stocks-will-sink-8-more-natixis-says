Indian stocks  may drop more than 8
percent within the next month after breaking below a support
level that confirmed a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern,
according to a technical analyst at Natixis.  The S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  may fall to as low as 16,400 after
sliding below the 18,150 level last week and thus breaching an
April low, Ouri Mimran said. That implies a 8.9 percent decline
from yesterday’s close. The gauge also breached the so-called
neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern on Aug. 9.  “We have seen quite a decline already in Indian stocks,”
Mimran said in a telephone interview from Paris. “With the
head-and-shoulders pattern confirmed, we are confronted with a
bearish signal, which means we could be seeing new lows soon.”  A head-and-shoulders reversal occurs when price movements
form three consecutive peaks on a chart, with the middle being
the highest. The start of a downturn is signaled when prices
fall below a line serving as the pattern’s base.  The Sensex rose to an intraday high of 20,203.66 on Jan. 29
and then fell to 18,144.22 on April 15, completing the first
shoulder. The gauge climbed to 20,443.62 on May 20, before
declining to 18,467.16 on June 24. That formed the head. Then,
the index then rallied 20,351.06 on July 23, after which it
dropped again.  The measure has fallen 11 percent from this year’s high on
July 23 on concern steps to stem a record slide in the rupee
will weigh on economic growth. The currency has lost 19 percent
against the  U.S. dollar  so far this year.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
