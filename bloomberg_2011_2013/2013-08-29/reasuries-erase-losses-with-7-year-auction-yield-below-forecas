Treasury 30-year bonds rose, pushing
yields to almost two-week lows, as investors weigh the prospects
for U.S. military action against  Syria , stoking haven demand.  Treasuries erased losses after the U.S. sold $29 billion in
seven-year notes at a yield of 2.221 percent, compared with a
forecast of 2.232 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of
the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers. White House press
secretary  Josh Earnest  said the administration still plans to
publicly release “before the end of the week” an unclassified
version of the intelligence assessment of the alleged chemical
weapons attack in Syria.  Benchmark 10-year yields  rose earlier
as a report showed the economy expanded last quarter faster than
previously forecast.  “Syria and whatever happens there is a net positive for
 government securities ,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed-income in
New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc. “We also have
supply out of the way.”  Yields on 30-year bonds fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.71 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent
securities maturing in August 2043 added 3/8, or $3.75 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 3/8.  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note  traded at 2.75
percent after rising as much as six basis points. The yield on
the current seven-year note was little changed at 2.19 percent.  Index Revisions  U.S. debt  was also supported today by month-end buying to
match market indexes. Funds that manage portfolios against
benchmark indexes, including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index,
typically buy longer-maturity Treasuries at almost month-end to
align the interest-rate sensitivity of their holdings with the
indexes.  The Barclays index will extend its duration, the measure of
rate-sensitivity, by 0.11 year on Sept.1, compared with 0.10
year on Aug. 1.  Treasuries lost 3.3 percent this year through yesterday,
including 0.8 percent in August, according to  Bloomberg U.S.
Treasury Bond Index. (BUSY)   At today’s sale, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing total bids with the amount of securities
offered, was 2.43, the least since May 2009 and versus an
average of 2.65 for the past 10 sales.  Auction Outcome  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.8 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 39.9 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 22.4 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 19.1 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  Seven-year notes have lost 4.8 percent this year, versus a
drop of 3.4 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-year securities
returned 3.9 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2
percent.  Today’s offering is the last of three note auctions this
week totaling $98 billion. The government sold $34 billion in
two-year debt on August 27 and $35 billion in five-year
securities yesterday.  The sales will raise $38.1 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $59.9 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Demand Trend  Investors have bid $2.87 for each dollar of the $1.443
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auctions
this year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold
at last year’s offerings.  Treasuries rose earlier this week on speculation the U.S.,
 France  and Britain were moving closer to military action against
Syria after the nation’s government allegedly used chemical
weapons against civilians.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  and U.K. Prime Minister  David
Cameron  face a decision whether to attack Syria without a UN
mandate amid Russian resistance, demands for consultation from
lawmakers at home and domestic opposition to involvement in
another conflict in the  Middle East .  The USS Stout is en route to join four other destroyers
already in the region, according to a defense official who asked
not to be identified discussing military preparations.  “People are speculating there may be a strike over the
weekend,” said Dan Mulholland, head of Treasury trading at BNY
Mellon Capital Markets in New York.  Fed Policy  The Fed bought $1.6 billion of securities maturing from
February 2036 to February 2043 today, according to the New York
Fed’s website. Debate about when policy makers will start to
taper the $85 billion in monthly bond buying has roiled
financial markets around the world in the past three months and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets.  The economy expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter
as a smaller trade deficit and gains in inventories overshadowed
the effects of  federal budget  cutbacks. The economy grew at a
2.5 percent annual pace in the second quarter, more than
forecast and up from the previous estimate of 1.7 percent.
Growth topped the median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg that projected a 2.2 percent gain.  Jobless claims in the week ended Aug. 24 dropped 6,000 to
331,000 from a revised 337,000 the week before that was higher
than initially reported, the Labor Department said. The median
forecast of 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop to 332,000.  “Tapering is almost a done deal unless you get a real bad
employment number in September,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
