Swedish retail sales unexpectedly
fell in July as high  unemployment  in the  export -reliant Nordic
economy weighed on spending.  Sales fell 0.7 percent in July, Stockholm-based  Statistics
Sweden  said today. The  median estimate  in a survey of six
economists by Bloomberg was for a 0.1 percent gain.  Sales (SWRSAMM)  rose
2.1 percent in the year.  “The current low levels of resource utilization mean that
recovery will be protracted, and so monetary policy will remain
expansionary for several years to come,” the Swedish National
Institute of  Economic Research  predicted yesterday.  Sweden ’s central bank won’t start raising its  main lending
rate  until the first quarter 2015 as the  economy  will grow just
1.1 percent and unemployment stay at an average 8 percent this
year and only fall to 7.8 percent in 2014, NIER forecast.  The krona slid 0.2 percent to 8.6977 per euro as of 9:36
