U.K.  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest in almost four years this month as the strengthening
economy made Britons more inclined to spend than at any time
since 2010.  A consumer sentiment index by GfK NOP Ltd. rose 3 points to
minus 13, the highest since October 2009, the London-based group
said in a report published today. A gauge based on whether
consumers think now is the right time to make major purchases
climbed 5 points to minus 16, the highest since December 2010.  Economic growth  accelerated to 0.7 percent in the three
months through June and manufacturing and services indexes have
strengthened this quarter. The British Chambers of Commerce
raised its forecasts today and said gross domestic product will
increase 1.3 percent this year, up from 0.9 percent previously.  “The recovery is not yet secure,” said BCC Director
General John Longworth. “We have had false dawns in recent
years and although this upturn appears to be on stronger ground,
we must be aware that complacency could lead to setbacks.”  GfK’s index of households’ outlook for the economy jumped 8
points to minus 1, the highest since April 2010. The measure of
people’s assessment of their financial situation over the next
year was unchanged in August at zero.  In its report, the BCC raised its 2014 GDP growth
projection to 2.2 percent from 1.9 percent, and upgraded its
2015 forecast to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent. Services
outperform other sectors, expanding 1.9 percent this year and
2.6 percent in 2014.  ‘Difficult Circumstances’  The group said the U.K. is “still facing difficult
circumstances” and that reducing the budget deficit is
“proving a longer and more painful task than we first
thought.” Additional cuts in current spending plans will be
needed until 2019 at the earliest, it warned.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Aug. 28 that
Britain’s recovery looks set to continue, though growth
prospects “are solid not stellar.” He introduced forward
guidance this month under which the BOE plans to keep its
 benchmark interest rate  at a record-low 0.5 percent at least
until unemployment falls to 7 percent.  While the BOE doesn’t see the jobless rate reaching the
threshold until the end of 2016, the BCC forecasts it will
happen in the fourth quarter of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
