Canadian manufacturersâ€™ raw material
costs rose at the fastest pace in more than two years in July,
government figures showed.  The  raw-materials price  index increased 4.2 percent as fuel
costs jumped 9.1 percent,  Statistics Canada  said today from
Ottawa. Economists predicted a 0.8 percent increase, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with seven
responses.  The  industrial product price index , which measures the
prices received by manufacturers for their goods, rose 0.3
percent, matching the median economist forecast.  Over the 12 months ending in July, raw material costs rose
7.6 percent and industrial prices rose 1.4 percent, suggesting
factory profit margins narrowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
