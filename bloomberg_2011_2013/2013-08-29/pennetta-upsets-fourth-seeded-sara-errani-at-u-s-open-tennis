Rafael Nadal  lost three games in
advancing to the third round of tennis’s  U.S. Open , where five-time winner Roger Federer and defending champion  Serena Williams 
also won second-round matches in straight sets.  Nadal, the men’s No. 2 seed from Spain, capped the day’s
action in Arthur Ashe Stadium with a 6-2, 6-1, 6-0 rout of
Brazilian qualifier Rogerio Dutra Silva.  “I played well,” Nadal said in a televised on-court
interview. “I started a little slower, but when the match was
coming on, I felt I was playing better and better.”  In today’s first match on the featured court at the
National Tennis Center in  New York ,  Flavia Pennetta  upset No. 4
seed Sara Errani. Williams, the 31-year-old American who has won
the tournament four times, followed with a 6-3, 6-0 win over
Galina Voskoboeva of  Kazakhstan  in a match originally scheduled
for yesterday but pushed back a day by rain.  Federer, the Swiss right-hander whose No. 7 seed is his
lowest since 2002, beat Carlos Berlocq of Argentina 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 to close out the day session in Arthur Ashe Stadium.  Caroline Wozniacki  of Denmark won in straight sets before
Nadal’s win, while second-seeded  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus
also advanced at the tennis season’s final Grand Slam, beating
Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak 6-3, 6-1.  Italian Matchup  With both women and men playing second-round matches today,
Pennetta, ranked 83rd on the WTA tour, beat Errani 6-3, 6-1 in a
meeting of Italian Fed Cup teammates. Errani became the highest-ranked player to exit the tournament.  Pennetta, a former top-10 player who missed last year’s
tournament with a wrist injury, had 33 winners, compared with 12
for Errani, who told reporters after the loss that she might
have been affected by the pressure of the match.  “The worst thing was the fight,” Errani said, criticizing
her own intensity. “Normally is my best thing that I do on the
court and today was not good.”  Men’s No. 4 seed  David Ferrer  got past fellow Spaniard
Roberto Bautista, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 6-2, while No. 8 Richard Gasquet of France, No. 18 Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia and No. 19
Tommy Robredo of Spain won in straight sets.  Seventh-seeded Petra Kvitova of the  Czech Republic  advanced
to the third round along with No. 8 seed Angelique Kerber of
Germany, No. 9 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia, No. 10 Roberta Vinci
of Italy, No. 11 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia, and No. 16 Sabine Lisicki of Germany.  Duval Loses  Victoria Duval, the 17-year-old American qualifier who
upset No. 11 Samantha Stosur in the opening round, was ousted
tonight by Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 6-2, 6-3.  Christina McHale, a 21-year-old from Englewood Cliffs, New
Jersey, beat Elina Svitolina of Ukraine 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 to advance
to a third-round match with 13th-seeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia.
