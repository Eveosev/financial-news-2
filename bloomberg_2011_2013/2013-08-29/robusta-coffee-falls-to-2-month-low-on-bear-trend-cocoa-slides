Robusta coffee fell to the lowest
price in almost two months in  London  as computer-generated
trading continued to sell amid declining stockpiles. Cocoa slid.  The beans for September delivery were $30 a metric ton
cheaper than the November futures, reversing the premium of $33
a ton two weeks ago, exchange data on Bloomberg showed. While
that may signal less concern about supplies, NYSE Liffe-monitored stockpiles are at the lowest since August 2007.  “Robusta looks towards the major support at $1,704 a
ton,” BGC Partners LLC in London said in a report e-mailed
today, adding that resistance was at $1,857 a ton. “Sentiment
has shifted somewhat it would seem, but the directional black
boxes will still be trading the bear trend. Perhaps it will take
a look towards $1,700 a ton before this trend will be bucked?”  Robusta coffee for November delivery declined 0.3 percent
to $1,759 a ton by 11:08 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. It
declined 0.7 percent to $1,752 a ton in earlier trade, the
lowest since July 1. Arabica coffee for delivery in December was
unchanged at $1.1845 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Robusta coffee stockpiles with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe were 78,750 tons on Aug.
19. Inventories were down from 83,770 tons two weeks earlier.
Reserves may fall to 52,000 tons before the end of the year, the
lowest since May 2000, according to a Bloomberg survey of 10
traders published on Aug. 27.  While the new crop in  Vietnam , the top producer of the
variety, is set to start in October, the first beans will be
available at the end of November, Nguyen Chi Cuong, chief
executive officer at trading company NC Group Ltd., which has
offices in Ho Chi Minh City, said by e-mail today.  Inventories  “There are some three months to go relying entirely on the
current crop,” Cuong said, adding that the market would be more
reliant on inventories in traders’ warehouses and reserves in
consuming countries.  White sugar for delivery in October gained 0.3 percent to
$479.20 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for delivery in the same
month rose 0.3 percent to 16.49 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for delivery in December slid 0.2 percent to 1,651
pounds ($2,560) a ton in London. Cocoa for delivery in the same
month declined 0.4 percent to $2,488 a ton in  New York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
