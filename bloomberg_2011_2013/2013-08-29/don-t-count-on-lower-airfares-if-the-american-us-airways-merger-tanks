U.S. Department of Justice lawyers, joined by attorneys general in six states, have sued to  block the pending merger of American and US Airways —and outrage over rising air fares and ancillary fees played a major role in the shocker. Comments from Assistant Attorney General William J. Baer on Aug. 13 left no doubt on that point. With a refreshingly jargon-free volley of insults, he blasted the deal as "pretty messed up," and said that unless Justice acts to prevent this  final wave of airline consolidation , consumers will pay many millions of dollars in additional fares and fees due to lack of competition. Much of the suit uses the words of the airlines’ own executives to, as business travel expert  Joe Brancatelli  put it, "hoist them on their own petard," by quoting the airlines as praising the benefits of consolidation. During a  conference call on Aug. 13, Baer answered questions from reporters , saying, “There is an underlying concern here is that if you go to just three legacy carriers, all of whom will look alike, their economic incentives will be closely aligned. And you listen to what the executives from US Airways say, all they want to do is get along. They don’t want to compete. They basically want to fly where they fly without competition. This merger would facilitate that…." But isn’t that true already? And will stopping this last big deal make any difference? As our  story on recent airline mega mergers  points out, whatever damage has been done to your wallet by consolidation is already a reality; the "big four" legacy airlines (Delta, United, American, and US Airways) aren’t exactly knocking themselves out to give consumers a good deal. And they don’t have to; by scaling back the number of flights in key markets, they’ve guaranteed full planes for themselves. As Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee), who's no fan of airline mergers, put it at a congressional hearing on the antitrust implications of the American-US Airways merger earlier this year, “It sort of looks like they got together and carved up the country. They are each getting their slice of the pie.” So while the airlines’ attorneys have vowed to fight their case in court and say they are confident they’ll prevail, the suit has already thrown off American’s carefully laid plans to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy as a New York Bankruptcy Court judge held back approval, arguing that the DOJ suit leaves too much uncertainty over the company’s future. So even if the merger goes kaput, where will this leave consumers? Probably right where they are now. But, to be fair, while  most airlines are now in the black , they are hardly raking in the big profits. Thanks to oil prices and other costs at sky high levels, the airline business has traditionally seen only razor slim profit margins even in good times. Fares and fees have in fact gone up in the past two years, but over the past ten years or so they’ve remained steady. But airline bosses’ intemperate comments about how consolidation will benefit them—not necessarily us—appear to have been the final straw for the DOJ. Loose lips could indeed sink this one.
