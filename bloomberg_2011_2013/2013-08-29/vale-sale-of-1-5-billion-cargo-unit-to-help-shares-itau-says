Vale SA’s cargo unit may be worth
$1.5 billion and an expected stake sale may benefit shares in
the world’s third-largest mining company, according to Banco
Itau BBA SA.  The valuation of Vale’s stock is likely to improve when the
Rio de Janeiro-based company sells a stake in VLI, or Valor da
Logistica Integrada SA, Itau BBA analysts Marcos Assumpcao and
Andre Pinheiro said. A divestment would also benefit Vale by
funding the unit without hurting Vale’s balance sheet, they said
in a research piece dated yesterday.  “This deal could help investors and analysts to better
value VLI into the company’s shares,” the analysts said.  Vale expects to announce the name of two VLI partners by
the end of the month and a third one before year-end as the
company finalizes the stake sale, Logistics head Humberto Freitas said on a conference call Aug. 8. The unit, which
controls ports, terminals and more than 10,000 kilometers (6,215
miles) of railroad in  Brazil , is seeking to invest 8.9 billion
reais ($3.8 billion) to expand capacity, Vale Chief Executive
Officer Murilo Ferreira told reporters last month.  In addition to VLI, Vale may also sell a 22 percent  stake 
in Oslo-based aluminum producer  Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY) , vessels and
smaller assets such as copper mines in  Chile  and coal ventures
in  Australia , the Itau analysts said in the note.  Vale  gained  0.2 percent to 31.30 reais at 1:27 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
