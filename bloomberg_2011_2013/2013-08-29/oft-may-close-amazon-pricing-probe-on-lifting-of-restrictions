The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading  said
it is considering dropping a probe into  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  after
the company said it would stop restricting sellers from offering
lower prices on other online platforms.  Amazon’s “price parity” policy had been the subject of
complaints and may have raised prices for consumers, the OFT
said in a statement today.  Germany ’s Federal Cartel Office said
Aug. 27 that it was also reviewing whether to drop a probe over
the pricing policy.  “We are pleased that sellers are now completely free to
set their prices as they wish, as this encourages price
competition and ensures consumers can get the best possible
deals,” Cavendish Elithorn, the OFT’s director for goods and
consumer issues, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
