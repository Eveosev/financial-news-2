Boston Marathon  organizers expanded
the field by 9,000 runners to 36,000 after fatal bombings in
April left thousands unable to finish.  Next year’s edition of the 26.2-mile race from Hopkinton,
 Massachusetts , to  Boston  will be the second-largest in its 118-year history, eclipsed only by the 38,708 entrants in the 1996
Centennial Boston Marathon.  “We understand many marathoners and qualifiers want to run
Boston in 2014, and we appreciate the support and patience that
the running community has demonstrated because of the bombings
that occurred this past spring,” Tom Grilik, executive director
of the Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the race,
said in a statement.  Two bombings near the finish line of this year’s race
killed three people and injured more than 200. Brothers Dzhokhar
and Tamerlan Tsarnaev were identified by authorities as prime
suspects. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a native of Chechnya in  Russia , was
arrested April 19 in Watertown, Massachusetts, hiding in a boat
after Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police.  Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty on July 10 to 30
counts, including murder, and could face the death penalty if
convicted. Prosecutors said the brothers were motivated by the
radical Islamic group al-Qaeda.  Some 5,624 runners were unable to finish the world’s oldest
annual marathon. They were granted automatic entry into the 2014
event, which is scheduled for April 21. Of those runners, more
than 4,500 have already registered, organizers said.  Registration for new qualifiers will begin Sept. 9, using a
two-year-old system that allows the fastest runners to  register 
first.  Qualifying Times  Eligible runners who have met the qualifying standard for
their age and gender by 20 minutes or more will sign up first,
followed by those who topped their times by 10 minutes on Sept.
11, and 5 minutes on Sept. 13. If space remains after the first
week, registration will re-open for all qualifiers Sept. 16-20.
Registration will remain open until the maximum field size is
reached.  With increased interest for the 2014 race, gaining entry
could be even more difficult. The demand has led to an increase
in the number of runners attempting to meet qualifying times in
races around the world before the Sept. 22 deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
