France  and  Germany  hold the key to
rebalancing the European economy and must follow through on
promised reforms, European Union Economic and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said.  “In a nutshell, this calls for competitiveness-supporting
economic reforms to the labor market, business environment
conditions and the pension system in France, and for structural
measures to further reinforce domestic demand in Germany,” Rehn
said in prepared remarks for a speech in Alpbach, Austria.  Already there are “welcome signs” that the EU is
recovering from its sovereign debt and financial crisis, which
accompanied a 18-month recession in the euro area, Rehn said.
Changes in the German economy would help without being felt
evenly across the 28-nation bloc.  “More domestic demand in Germany would not necessarily
benefit all euro-zone countries to the same extent,” he said.
“Rather, the positive impact on growth would mostly be felt in
its neighboring countries.”  Rehn also called on the EU to continue integrating its
financial markets and building regulatory and supervisory
frameworks for the banking union effort.  “The banking union will not be completed overnight. But it
must be given a good start,” Rehn said. “Rigorous asset-quality reviews and stress tests scheduled for early next year
are crucial to address the remaining weaknesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
