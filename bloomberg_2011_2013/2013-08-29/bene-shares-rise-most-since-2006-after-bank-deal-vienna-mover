Bene AG (BENE)  shares rose the most since
March 2006 after the Austrian maker of office furniture reached
a deal with its banks for new financing.  The stock rose 18 cents, or 27 percent, to 85 cents a share
in the Austrian capital. Almost nine times the average number of
shares traded hands than in the last 90-days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Bene’s financing package “provides a realignment of the
existing credit lines with longer terms,” the Waidhofen an der
Ybbs, Austria-based company said. The deal refinanced Bene’s 40
million euro bond due next year and extended 14 million euros of
new funding.  The company will report its half-year financial results
Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
