A U.K. court will rule as soon as
next month on a $1.6 billion dispute involving  Gulf Keystone
Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)  and a former soldier who is seeking a share of
the company’s Iraqi oil fields.  While an exact date for the ruling hasn’t been scheduled, a
verdict will likely be issued within the next two weeks, a
judicial spokeswoman said in an e-mail.  Wempen, through his company Excalibur Ventures LLC, claims
Texas Keystone signed a 2006 agreement to give him a 30 percent
share of any oil concessions it won in the Kurdistan region of
Iraq and that it was an agent of Gulf Keystone. The stake was
worth as much as $1.6 billion, he said in court documents.  Gulf Keystone argued at a trial that began in October that
Wempen didn’t hold up his end of the deal because he didn’t
contribute to the exploration costs.  Mark Antelme, an external spokesman for Hamilton, Bermuda-based Gulf Keystone in  London , declined to comment.  The case is: Excalibur Ventures LLC v. Texas Keystone Inc.
& Ors,  High Court  of Justice, Queen’s  Bench Division , Commercial
Court, 10-1517.  To contact the reporter on this story:
