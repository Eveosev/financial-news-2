Developers of  power plants  in  Brazil 
that run on biomass and hydroelectricity won the biggest share
of contracts to sell electricity to distributors in a
government-organized auction.  Eight biomass developers agreed to build 647 megawatts of
generation capacity, according to information on the CCEE
electricity trading board website today. The projects, which
must go into operation by 2018, will sell power at an average
price of 133.57 reais ($56.60) a megawatt-hour, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Developers of hydroelectric dams won contracts to sell
power from plants with 618.5 megawatts of capacity at an average
rate of 125.4 reais a megawatt-hour, the data showed.  In Brazil’s energy auctions, developers bid down from a
preset ceiling price the rate they’re willing to sell
electricity. The lowest bidders win contracts to sell power to
distributors and move forward with their planned projects. The
country gets 81 percent of its power from hydro plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
