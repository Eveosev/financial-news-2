Global regulators called on nations
to accelerate efforts to decrease reliance on credit ratings.  Regulatory reliance on ratings can lead to “herd behavior
and cliff effects in market prices when downgrades occur,” the
Financial Stability Board said in a report to leaders of the
Group of 20 nations.  “The U.S. has moved the furthest in removing hard-wiring
of ratings, and the EU has also made significant progress,” the
FSB, which brings together G-20 regulators and central bankers,
said in the report. “Progress in most other jurisdictions has
been slower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
