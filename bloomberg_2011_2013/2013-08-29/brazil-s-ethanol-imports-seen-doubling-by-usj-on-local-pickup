Brazil  ethanol imports, mainly from
the U.S., probably will almost double this season as consumption
grows for the first time in four years, according to Grupo USJ.  Latin America ’s largest economy is expected to import about
1 billion liters (263.9 million gallons) in the crop year
started April 1 to meet rising local consumption, said Narciso Bertholdi, a director at USJ, which is a partner of Cargill Inc.
in two sugar and ethanol ventures in Brazil.  “We’re surprised to see how domestic ethanol demand
improved this year,” Bertholdi said in an Aug. 27 interview
fron Araras, Brazil. “We will end up importing from the U.S. to
meet the gap in demand.”  Brazil will import ethanol between December and April, when
mills close for maintenance after harvest, to meet production
targets for the mandatory amount of the fuel that is blended
into gasoline, Bertholdi said. Most passenger cars in Brazil run
on pure ethanol or a mixture of 25 percent of the biofuel with
gasoline.  Ethanol consumption, which declined for three straight
years, expanded 2.1 percent in the first half of 2013, according
to data on Brazil’s fuel regulator website.  Brazil imported 545.6 million liters of ethanol in the
previous crop year, according to information on the Unica sugar-cane industry group website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
