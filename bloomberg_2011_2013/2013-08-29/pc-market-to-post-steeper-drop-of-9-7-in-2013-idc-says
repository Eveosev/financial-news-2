Global personal-computer shipments
will decline more than previously forecast this year as
consumers in  emerging markets  follow those in developed
countries in shifting to mobile devices, IDC said.  Unit sales will drop 9.7 percent in 2013, the Framingham,
Massachusetts-based researcher said today in a  statement . That
compares with a May projection for a 7.8 decline. The market
will shrink until 2015, when it is estimated to post “modest”
gains at a percentage in the single digits, IDC said.  Even a return to higher shipments won’t deliver the peak
sales levels reached in 2011, the researcher said.  China  and
other emerging economies, where growth had been compensating for
declining sales in developed markets, are now contracting at a
faster rate than mature regions.  Chinese unit shipments will decline by double digits this
year amid an accumulation of inventory and persistent customer
interest in smartphones and tablets, according to IDC.  Worldwide, IDC is predicting 315.4 million PCs will be
shipped this year, down from 349.2 million last year. It
estimates the market will reach 319.8 million units by 2017.  Earlier today, IDC trimmed its forecast for tablet-computer
sales through 2017 as larger smartphones and wearable
technology, such as Google Inc.’s Glass, also compete for
consumers’ attention. Tablet shipments are still  estimated  to
increase 58 percent this year, and unit sales will reach almost
407 million by 2017, IDC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
