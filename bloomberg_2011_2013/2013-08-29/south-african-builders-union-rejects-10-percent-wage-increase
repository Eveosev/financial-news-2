South African construction workers
rejected an offer of a 10 percent wage increase from employers
and are holding out for 14 percent plus improved benefits, the
National Union of Mineworkers said.  “The strike is still on,” NUM spokesman  Lesiba Seshoka 
said in a phone interview today. The offer “only equals a 400
rand ($38.73) increase a month.”  About 90,000 construction workers have been on strike since
Aug. 26 after wage talks deadlocked. Autoworkers and airline
staff have also downed tools while motor industry employees and
gold miners are threatening labor disruption in  Africa ’s biggest
economy.  The building industry strike won’t be resolved in the near
term as the gap between the union’s wage demands and the offer
from employers is too wide, according to the country’s biggest
builder.  “The parties are quite far apart,”  Murray & Roberts
Holdings Ltd. (MUR)  Chief Executive Officer Henry Laas said in an
interview in Johannesburg today. “It’s going to be difficult to
close the gap in a short period of time.”  The strike has brought Murray & Roberts projects worth
about 19 billion rand to a standstill, according to Financial
Director Cobus Bester. Labor unrest cost the Johannesburg-based
company about 350 million rand in the year through June,
including 182 million rand at Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.’s Medupi
coal-fired plant.  The  National Union of Mineworkers  will meet with
construction employers tomorrow for further wage talks, the
union’s Seshoka said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
