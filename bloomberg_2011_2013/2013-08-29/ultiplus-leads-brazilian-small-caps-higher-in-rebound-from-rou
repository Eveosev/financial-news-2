Multiplus SA (MPLU3) , the frequent-flier
unit of Latam Airlines Group SA’s Brazilian subsidiary, rose the
most in three weeks after JPMorgan Chase & Co. recommended
buying the stock after a plunge spurred by executive departures.  The shares climbed 5.2 percent to 25.36 reais at 1:10 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo . A close at that that level would be the biggest
one-day advance since August 9. It was best performer on the
BM&FBovespa Small Cap Index, which rose 1.3 percent.  The stock’s 22 percent decline this month through
yesterday, driven by the recent departures of the company’s
chief executive and chief financial officers, was
“exaggerated,” JPMorgan analysts led by Fernando Abdalla wrote
in a research note dated today. “Multiplus’s business plan
remains unchanged despite the departure of the executives,”
they wrote.  The Sao Paulo-based company’s decline this month compares
with a 3.5 percent drop in the Brazilian small cap index.  JPMorgan’s recommendation change “is mostly explained by
our perception of an exaggerated” selloff, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
