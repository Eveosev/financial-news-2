Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Odyssey minivan is
the first in its class to receive the highest safety rating in
new U.S. insurance-industry crash tests, reflecting the
automaker’s move to redesign the vehicle.  The U.S.’s best-selling minivan received the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety’s top-safety-pick-plus designation
for scoring “good” on a test designed to simulate one of the
deadliest types of front-end collisions.  Honda, based in  Tokyo , requested an early evaluation of its
2014 Odyssey, which it modified with the intent of passing the
so-called small-overlap test. An earlier Odyssey model fared
poorly in that test when it was being developed by the insurance
group.  “Safety is high on the list for parents when it comes to
shopping for a family vehicle,”  Adrian Lund , president of the
insurance group based in Arlington,  Virginia , said in an e-mailed statement. “Consumers look for models with the highest
safety ratings. Honda is ahead of many of its competitors in
building state-of-the-art crashworthiness into its vehicles.”  The insurance institute’s test simulates a vehicle’s front
corner colliding with a car, tree or pole. It’s tougher than
U.S. auto-safety regulators’ crash tests that are used to rate
vehicles on a five-star system.  The institute has tested sport-utility vehicles and small-and medium-sized sedans in the past year. Many have scored
poorly; among small SUVs, for instance, 11 of 13 models scored
“poor” or “marginal.” It said it plans to test other
minivans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
