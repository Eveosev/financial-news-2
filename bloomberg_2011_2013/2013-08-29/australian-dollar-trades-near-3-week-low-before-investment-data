Australia ’s dollar traded near its
lowest level in three weeks before a report today that may show
business investment stalled in the second quarter, adding to
evidence of an economic slowdown in the South Pacific nation.  Demand for the Aussie was limited as a global equity
decline sapped appetite for higher-yielding assets, after the
U.S. and the U.K. said they’re prepared to take military action
against  Syria  without authorization from the United Nations
Security Council. The Australian currency touched a week-low
versus its New Zealand peer after volatility climbed to the
highest in six weeks.  “There’s a bit of price risk today with the private
capital expenditure report,” said Janu Chan, an economist at
St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “The big drivers this week are
developments in Syria and a general sense of risk aversion
within financial markets, and in that environment the Aussie
tends to weaken.”  The Australian dollar added 0.1 percent to 89.49 U.S. cents
as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney after sliding as much as 1 percent
yesterday to 88.93 cents, the weakest since Aug. 5. It lost 0.1
percent to NZ$1.1447 after earlier touching NZ$1.1439, the least
since Aug. 22.  Australia’s  10-year (GACGB10)  government bond yield climbed two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.93 percent, its first
advance in a week. The rate on the nation’s sovereign notes due
in three years was little changed at 2.72 percent.  The MSCI World Index of developed-nation stocks declined
0.3 percent yesterday, falling for a third-straight session.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics will probably say today
 capital expenditure  stalled in the three months through June
from the previous period, when it fell 4.7 percent, according to
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Volatility on one-month Aussie options was at 13.18 percent
today after rising to 13.32 percent yesterday, the highest since
July 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
