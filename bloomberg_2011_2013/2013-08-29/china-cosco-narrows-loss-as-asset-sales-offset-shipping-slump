China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s biggest shipping company, narrowed its first-half loss
as gains from selling assets helped offset a freight-rate slump.  The  net loss  in the six months to June was 990 million  yuan 
($162 million), compared with 4.87 billion yuan a year earlier,
the company said in a filing to the  Shanghai  Stock Exchange
today. Sales fell 13 percent.  China Cosco is restructuring assets in a bid to return to
profit as a third straight annual loss may result in its shares
being delisted in Shanghai. The company had a gain of 3.13
billion yuan in the first half from the sale of assets including
a a logistics unit, as shipping lines struggled with
overcapacity.  Cosco’s container-shipping unit,  Asia’s second-biggest ,
posted a net loss of 2.24 billion yuan while its commodity-carrying arm had a net loss of 1.82 billion yuan, according to
the statement.  China Cosco fell 0.3 percent to HK$3.43 in Hong Kong
trading, before the earnings were released. The stock has
dropped 10 percent this year.  “The imbalance between demand and supply in the
international shipping market had no material improvement,” the
company said in the statement. “We will continue to work toward
the target of turning around this year, which is our top
priority.”  Container Volume  Revenue from shipping containers fell 1.4 percent even
though Cosco moved 8.7 percent more boxes, as average rates
declined from a year earlier, especially on the Asia-Europe
route, according to the statement.  Carriers competed to fill their ships. Commodity-shipping
volumes dropped 3.5 percent from a year earlier and the average
of  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , the benchmark for commodity-moving rates
dropped 11 percent during the period, the company said.  China Cosco booked a net gain of 1.85 billion yuan from
selling the logistics unit. It also had a gain of 1.28 billion
yuan through the sale of its stake in  China International Marine
Containers Group Co. (2039)  by group company  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , in
which it owns 43.21 percent, according to Bloomberg calculation.  China Cosco had a fleet of 332 owned and leased dry-bulk
ships as of June 30, compared with 380 six months earlier,
according to the statement. It also had another 15 dry-bulk
ships on order. Its container-ship fleet totaled 187 ships, with
another 10 on order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
