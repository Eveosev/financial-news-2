Use of sleeping medications
increases with age and education levels, according to a U.S.
report on the demographics of those taking the drugs.  About 4 percent of U.S. adults ages 20 and older reported
taking a sleep aid, according to the study released today from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 3 percent
of those who didn’t finish high school reported using sleep
aids, compared with 4.4 percent of those with high school
degrees or higher education. Use was greater among people older
than 70, the Atlanta-based agency said.  Prescriptions for sleep aids have tripled over the past two
decades, according to the report. Today’s research looked at
trends from 2005 to 2010 and is the first to examine differences
in use of the drugs by social and demographic groups, the
authors wrote. About 50 million to 70 million Americans have
sleep disorders or are sleep-deprived, which can increase
difficulties in functioning.  “Prescription sleep aids are one of the treatment options
for trouble going into or maintaining sleep,” the authors
wrote. Long-term use of these medicines also can be harmful,
they said.  Older people were most likely to use sleeping pills, with 7
percent of those 80 and older and 5.7 percent of those 70 to 79
reporting having used the drugs within the previous 30 days,
during the course of the study. More women than men reported
using the medications.  Most adults need at least seven hours of sleep to avoid
higher likelihoods of illness and death,  according to the 
National Sleep Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
