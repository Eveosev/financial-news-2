A taskforce set up by global
regulators to coordinate reviews of interbank offered rates said
it would report by June next year on progress in identifying
alternatives to the benchmarks.  The group, led by Martin Wheatley, chief executive officer
of the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, and U.S. Federal
Reserve Governor  Jeremy Stein , will “focus its initial work on
the interest rate benchmarks that are considered to play the
most fundamental role in the global financial system,” the
Financial Stability Board said in a  statement  on its website
today.  The taskforce will assess whether “deficiencies” in the
way benchmarks are set and a lack of oversight of the rates in
the past that led to them being abused have been addressed.  The FSB, which set up the taskforce, brings together
regulators and central bankers from the Group of 20 nations. It
will also weigh proposals from the finance industry for “robust
reference interest rates that could serve as potential
alternatives to the most widely-used, existing benchmark
rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
