Eurocash SA, Poland’s largest
distributor of non-durable  consumer goods , headed for the
biggest gain in a month after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
recommendation for the stock.  The  shares  climbed as much as 4.3 percent and traded 3.2
percent higher to 48.51 zloty as of 12:20 p.m. in Warsaw,
heading for the biggest advance on a closing basis since July
29, as JPMorgan increased its rating to  overweight  from neutral
and set its price estimate at 54 zloty per share.  Eurocash, which is merging with Tradis distributor bought
for 1.1 billion zloty ($341 million) in 2011, saw its share
price slump 40 percent since May 31 through yesterday.  The company offers an “11 percent potential upside despite
some ongoing challenges in the Tradis segment that are likely to
linger for the next few quarters,” Michal Kuzawinski, a Warsaw-based analyst at JPMorgan said in a note today. “Better
macroeconomic outlook” for the second half of this year
“should help offset Tradis integration issues” with prospects
improving into 2014.  JPMorgan expects the Polish economic growth to quicken to
2.5 percent next year from 1.2 percent seen in 2013, according
to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
