Michigan ’s Oakland County, which
borders  Detroit  to the north along 8 Mile Road, is set to sell
$350 million of debt next month in the biggest offer from the
state since June, before the city’s record bankruptcy.  Moody’s Investors Service gives the county’s limited-tax
general obligations its highest grade, with a stable outlook,
citing a “very large and fairly affluent tax base.” Proceeds
from the sale, set for Sept. 10, will refinance debt issued in
2007 for retiree medical benefits, the New York-based ratings
company said yesterday.  Since Detroit filed the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy
on July 18, at least three Michigan localities postponed bond
sales because interest rates were higher than they were willing
to pay. In the six weeks through Aug. 23, Michigan issuers sold
about $121 million of long-term debt, the slowest borrowing wave
since January 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors have speculated that Detroit Emergency Manager
Kevyn Orr’s proposal for the city’s general-obligation bonds
could set a precedent across the state. He wants to give holders
of the debt less than 20 cents on the dollar.  Oakland County’s deal is the largest since Michigan’s State
Building Authority issued $583 million during the last week of
June, Bloomberg data show.  Robert Daddow, the county’s deputy executive, didn’t
immediately return a message left at his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
