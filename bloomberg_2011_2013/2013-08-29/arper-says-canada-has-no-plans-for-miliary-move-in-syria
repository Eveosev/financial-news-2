Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said his government has no plans for a military mission
against  Syria  and he’ll support action taken by allies including
the U.S. and the U.K.  Harper, speaking to reporters in Toronto, said he’s a
“reluctant convert” to the idea that a military strike in
Syria is necessary because what appears to be the use of
chemical weapons is a “dangerous precedent” that requires a
strong reaction.  “We do support our allies who are contemplating forceful
action to deal with this,” Harper said, adding that at present,
“we have no plans of our own to have a Canadian military
mission.”  The prospect of an imminent attack on Syria faded as U.K.
Prime Minister  David Cameron  struggled to win parliamentary
backing for military strikes that critics said echoed the push
to war in  Iraq .  Britain released an assessment showing it “highly likely”
the Syrian government was behind the mass killing of civilians
with chemical weapons on Aug. 21 near Damascus.  Cameron bowed to opposition demands to await a judgment by
on-site United Nations inspectors. A UN mission will continue to
inspect the site of the chemical attack tomorrow and leave Syria
by early Aug. 31, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
told reporters in Vienna today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
