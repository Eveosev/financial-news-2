The day after Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said U.S. forces were ready to strike  Syria , a website backing President Bashar al-Assad announced that an elite group called the “Eagles Martyrdom Aerial Squadron” was ready to sacrifice itself in kamikaze attacks on the enemy.  Prime Minister Wael al-Halaqi followed this week by saying Syria would be a “graveyard for invaders,” according to the state news agency, while Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said the military would “surprise” the world with its might.  Bombast aside, the Syrian forces’ ability or motivation to retaliate against attacks is less clear. Sapped by more than two years of civil war, battered by defections and deprived of spare parts, Assad would struggle to mount a serious response.  “It’s not in their interest to retaliate nor do they have clean, clear or useful options to respond,” said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Middle East Center in  Beirut . “Strategically, the Syrians would want  Barack Obama  to do it and go home.”  While the U.S. and allies consider punishing Assad for what they say is his use of chemical weapons on Aug. 21, they’ve also said any attack would be targeted. Syrian officials have denied using chemical weapons in the war that’s already killed 100,000 people, according to United Nations estimates.  ‘Absorb the Blow’  Assad may choose to “absorb the blow” of a limited strike rather than take on a superior force and risk the gains his military has made against the rebels on the battlefield, Salem said.  Syria’s military forces fell to about half their notional strength of 220,000 by autumn 2012 as a “result of a combination of defections, desertions and casualties,” according to a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.  The loyalty of remaining troops is also in doubt. Only three of Syria’s 12 divisions have been involved in the war, including the 4th Armored Division, an elite unit led by Maher al-Assad, the younger brother of the president, said Michael Eisenstadt of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.  “What they really are short of is loyal soldiers,” Eisenstadt said. “The last thing Syria needs is to open a second front at this time.”  Assad’s troops are also probably struggling with equipment in disrepair.  Heavy Casualties  “Most formations are now understrength. Some brigades are reported to have been disbanded because of either political unreliability or heavy casualties,” the IISS said in its  Military Balance 2013  report. “The level of readiness of a significant element of the air force’s combat aircraft inventory is likely poor.”  As the U.S. considers its options, the risk is that Assad is pushed into a corner where he sees no way out.  Assad’s arsenal includes Scud and Iranian-made Fateh missiles, according to Pieter Wezeman, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research  Institute .  “If Assad believes the strikes are there to finish him and his regime off, then he’ll say, ‘it doesn’t matter anymore,’ and he would use whatever he can to set the region on fire,” said Volker Perthes, director of the Berlin-based German Institute for International and Security Affairs, which advises  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government.  Hezbollah Attacks  Instead, Assad’s response may be limited to urging Lebanon’s Hezbollah -- whose fighters are helping him -- to attack Israel, Salem said. Even that may be in doubt as  Iran  is unlikely to authorize utilizing Hezbollah because it relies on the group “as a deterrent to Israeli strikes against its nuclear program,” said Torbjorn Soltvedt, senior analyst at  Maplecroft , a U.K.-based risk consultant.  Israel has been caught in similar crossfire in the past. During the first Gulf War in 1991, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fired Scud missiles at the Jewish state after the U.S. attacked  Iraq  for invading  Kuwait .  Hezbollah, which the U.S. considers a terrorist organization, hasn’t fired at Israel since it bombarded it with almost 4,000 rockets during their monthlong war in the summer of 2006. Israel shot down a Hezbollah drone over southern Israel in October.  If Hezbollah were to react, it would likely respond against Gulf states rather than directly against the U.S., Evan Kohlmann, senior partner at Flashpoint Partners in New York, said by telephone.  “In our assessment, their anger has mostly been directed toward the nations of the Gulf,” especially Saudi Arabia, Kohlmann said.  No Response  Syria’s lack of response to earlier aerial attacks, even after threatening to do so, may also show its limited capacity and willingness to open new fronts.  Unconfirmed media reports have attributed three air strikes on Syrian arms convoys or storage sites to  Israel . One of those killed at least 42 Syrian soldiers, according to the Coventry, England-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.  Syria’s anti-aircraft system, while more sophisticated than the one faced by NATO in Libya, still uses some Soviet-era technology, Soltvedt said.  Assad yesterday blamed Israel and the U.S. for sponsoring the “terrorists” in his country and vowed to defend Syria against all attacks.  “It’s normal for the regime to talk big, but in the end it’ll find a way to put the strike behind it and get back to the local fighting,” Salem said.
