SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the third-largest
U.S. solar company, is seeking to raise as much as $223.5
million by offering shares and selling convertible notes.  The company plans to offer 2.8 million shares at $33.69
each, and underwriters Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  have an option to purchase an
additional 420,000 shares within 30 days, the San Mateo,
California-based company said today in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  SolarCity is also selling $100 million in convertible notes
in a concurrent offering. The figure may increase to $115
million if the underwriters exercise an overallotment option.  Chief Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive  and Chairman Elon Musk
plan to buy a total of 560,000 shares from the underwriters,
according to the filing. Musk, who is also chairman and CEO of
Tesla Motors Inc., is SolarCity’s largest shareholder with a 27
percent stake, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Rive is
Musk’s cousin and owns 3.5 percent of the company.  There will be 81.08 million SolarCity shares outstanding
after the offering.  SolarCity owns and operates rooftop solar systems.
Homeowners and commercial customers typically pay little to no
upfront costs for the equipment and sign long-term contracts to
purchase the power.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and  SunPower Corp. (SPWR)  are the largest U.S.
solar companies by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
