The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
dropped for the first time in three days, according to traders
of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 basis points to 165 basis points
as of 9:09 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge, which advanced 11.1 basis points over
the last two days to a two-month high, is set for its first
decline since Aug. 26, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 128 as of 10:16 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark is also poised for its
first decline in three days, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1 basis point to 98
basis points as of 9:16 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The measure, which has ranged from 90.9 to 110.2
this quarter, is down 2.2 basis points from July 31, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
