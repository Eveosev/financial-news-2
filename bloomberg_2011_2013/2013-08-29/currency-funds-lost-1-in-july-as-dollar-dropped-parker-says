Foreign-exchange funds lost 1
percent in July as the dollar fell amid speculation over when
the  Federal Reserve  may reduce asset purchases, according to
Parker Global Strategies LLC.  Among the 39 programs that reported results, performances
ranged from a return of about 5.3 percent to a loss of 5.9
percent, the company said today in a statement. Ten funds gained
money and 29 programs reported a loss.  “During the month, the  U.S. dollar  experienced significant
volatility,” according to Parker, based in Stamford,
Connecticut. “Managers noted that Group of 10 central banks’
actions will continue to significantly impact global emerging-market  currency markets .”  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against 10 major peers, fell 1.4 percent in July, the biggest
decline since June 2012, to 1,025.74. The gauge has risen 0.8
percent to 1,033.81 since then.  Fed policy makers are debating whether the  U.S. economy  is
strong enough to allow them to pare back monthly purchases of
$85 billion in Treasuries and mortgage debt, which tend to
debase the currency. Officials will reduce the amount at their
next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of
economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey.  The Parker FX Index is up 0.5 percent this year and has
declined 0.1 percent during the past 12 months. The index
includes 42 programs managing about $41 billion by 35 firms
worldwide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
