Dracula,  Frida Kahlo  and Lady Gaga are our (non-related) choices for London this weekend.  STAGE  The 28 rivals in “A Chorus Line” are about to appear for the last time at the Palladium in their battle for stardom. Information:  http://www.achoruslinelondon.com  +44-844-412-2957.  Two other excellent shows, both comedies, are also coming to the end of their runs on Aug. 31: “The Cripple of Inishmaan” starring  Daniel Radcliffe , and Alan Ayckbourn’s “Relatively Speaking” with Felicity Kendal.  DINING  Picture is an informal new restaurant and bar just north of Oxford Street. This shopping area is filled with fast-food outlets and could well use more good places to eat. Picture was opened earlier this year by three friends who previously worked at Arbutus and  Wild Honey . You can see the inspiration in a menu that offers quality cooking at everyday prices.

It’s difficult to find but worth the effort. Stevie Parle is a young chef who is not afraid to experiment. He’s traveled widely, including for his TV series “ Spice Trip ,” which took him to  Mexico , Zanzibar, Cambodia and  Turkey . You can taste a range of influences in his ever-changing menu. Information:  http://www.dockkitchen.co.uk/about.php  or +44-20-8962-1610.  VISUAL ARTS  Mexico was once the go-to place for artists seeking low-cost living and a revolutionary atmosphere. Even D.H. Lawrence made his way over.  You can see some of the results in the  Royal Academy ’s “Mexico: A Revolution in Art, 1910-1940.” The finest painting of all is by Kahlo: a self-portrait so tiny it would fit in a locket, with her signature monobrow. Otherwise, the photography stands out -- especially Henri Cartier-Bresson’s Mexican prostitutes.  “Mexico: A Revolution in Art, 1910-1940” is at the Royal Academy through September 29:  http://www.royalcademy.org.uk  or +44-20-7300-8000.  MUSIC  At the Roundhouse on Sunday, Lady Gaga previews the “Artpop”  album  out later this year. The star normally plays London’s largest venues such as Twickenham Stadium. This time she is downsizing at the start of the iTunes Festival, now in its seventh year, which brings 30 nights of free music to those who win ticket ballots.  The series also includes shows by  Justin Timberlake , Haim,  Elton John  and Kings of Leon.  http://www.itunesfestival.com/   The BBC Proms continues with its eclectic program at the  Royal Albert Hall . Strauss’s “Also Sprach Zarathustra” Friday is followed by movie music Saturday and Arvo Part Sunday.  OTHER LONDON OUTINGS  Tremble in the forecourt of the  British Museum .  “Monster Weekend” features horror movies inspired by the museum and its collections. “Dracula” screens on Friday and “The Mummy” Saturday, both at 8 p.m. For more information:  http://www.britishmuseum.org  or +44-20-7928-3232.
