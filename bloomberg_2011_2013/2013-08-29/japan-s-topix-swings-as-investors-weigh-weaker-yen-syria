Japan’s  Topix index  swung between
gains and losses as a weaker yen boosted exporters while
investors shunned risk assets on the possibility the U.S. will
lead military action against Syria.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest carmaker, advanced 0.5
percent after the yen dropped 0.6 percent against the dollar
yesterday. Oil stocks led gains on the  Topix (TPX)  after crude traded
at a two-year high yesterday. Power producers declined the most
among the gauge’s 33 industry groups. Komatsu Ltd. slid 1.4
percent after rival Joy Global Inc., the largest maker of
underground mining equipment, projected a decline in sales amid
a slowdown in demand for metals and coal.  The Topix added less than 0.1 percent to 1,114.26 as of
9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , after falling as much as 0.1 percent. The
gauge lost 1.8 percent yesterday to close at its lowest level
since June 27. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average increased 0.5
percent today to 13,400.97.  “With the recent correction and the growing feeling stocks
are undervalued, some investors will be buying back shares,”
said  Mitsushige Akino , chief  fund manager  at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “But increasing concerns and
complications mean investors may take a wait-and-see approach
and buying will be limited.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
