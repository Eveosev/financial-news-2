Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded as producers of the biofuel sold to take advantage of
the highest corn crush spreads this year and as exports sank.
Renewable Identification Numbers tumbled.  The spread, or price difference, widened 0.29 cent to 60.14
cents a gallon a day after the corn crush spread, or the price
difference between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to
make it, touched 66 cents. Separately, RINs dropped after the
government said the amount issued in July rose.  “They’re letting it go at the right price,” said Mark
Ruyack, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida .
“They’re keeping the tanks wet.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 3.1 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $2.465 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
