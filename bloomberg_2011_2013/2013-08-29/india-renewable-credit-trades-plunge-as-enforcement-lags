Renewable-energy  credit trading in
India slumped to a record-low this month as states failed to
enforce rules requiring utilities, steelmakers and mining
companies to buy the allowances.  Bids to sell wind, hydro and biomass credits outnumbered
bids to buy them more than 70-fold. That meant only 40,889
trades were cleared, or 1.4 percent of the credits available for
sale, the lowest percentage since trading began in 2011,
according to data from trader REConnect Energy Solutions Pvt.  The government requires companies such as  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) 
and  Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  to get as much as 10 percent of their energy
from renewables. Those unable to source enough locally can meet
targets by purchasing credits from clean-energy utilities sold
on the power exchanges.  The credits are languishing at their minimum price because
the rules haven’t been strictly enforced, according to the
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. Regulators in Gujarat
state, India’s third-largest for renewable capacity, this month
waived targets and fines for local utilities including  Torrent
Power Ltd. (TPW)   Wind, hydropower and biomass credits traded at their floor
price of 1,500 rupees ($22) for a 12th straight month. Solar
credits, which trade separately, also cleared at their minimum
price of 9,300 rupees. Each credit represents 1 megawatt-hour of
electricity fed into the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
