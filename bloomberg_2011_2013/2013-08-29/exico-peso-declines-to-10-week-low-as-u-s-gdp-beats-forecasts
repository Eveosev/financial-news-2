Mexico ’s peso fell to a 10-week low
as a report showed that the U.S. economy expanded faster than
forecast last quarter, adding to speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce monetary stimulus next month.  The currency slipped 0.1 percent to 13.3339 per  U.S. dollar 
at 9:35 a.m. in Mexico City, leaving it down 3.6 percent this
year. Yields on Mexico’s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.39 percent
today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s peso has been  Latin America ’s worst-performing
major currency in August, and closed yesterday at its weakest
level since June 20, on concern that a tapering of the Fed’s $85
billion monthly bond purchases will pare capital flows into the
country. Bets on reduced stimulus were fueled today by data
showing the  U.S. economy  grew at a 2.5 percent annualized rate
in the second quarter, above analysts’ 2.2 percent estimate.  “The market is now discounting that we’re very close to a
reduction in stimulus,” Eduardo Rodriguez, a currency trader at
Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB, said in a telephone interview from
Guadalajara, Mexico. “As long as there’s nothing convincing,
like a statement from the Fed or very bad U.S. data, we’re going
to continue with a relatively weak peso.”  Mexico central bank Governor Agustin Carstens has asked the
Fed to clarify plans for tapering. The Fed will pare its monthly
bond purchases at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, according to 65
percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg Aug. 9-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
