Eike Batista , the Brazilian
entrepreneur whose fortune declined by more than $30 billion
since last year, sold a 5.4 percent stake in  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3)  after
it said he would inject capital into the cash-strapped ship
company.  The sale “doesn’t modify the controlling or administrative
structure of the company,” OSX said in a regulatory filing
today. Batista sold the stake in two batches on Aug. 27 and
yesterday, according to the filing. The company based in Rio de
Janeiro said two days ago that it would exercise a portion of a
put option pledged by controlling shareholder Batista.  OSX is seeking to sell assets, close projects and cut debt
amid a restructuring overseen by Marcelo Gomes, who took over as
chief executive officer Aug. 23. The restructuring started in
May after its main client, Batista’s  OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA (OGXP3) , missed financial and production targets that
have dragged down Batista’s interlinked commodities and energy
empire.  Batista sold 6.4 million OSX shares on Aug. 27 and 10.4
million yesterday, according to the filing, which didn’t
disclose how much he raised. OSX shares, which dropped a total
of 31 percent over the past three days, closed at 87 centavos
yesterday in Sao Paulo. Today’s filing was released before the
market opened for regular trading.  OSX slid as much as 20 percent and traded down 13 percent
at 77 centavos at 11:13 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The stock has plunged
93 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
