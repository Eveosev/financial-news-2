Chevron Corp. (CVX)  pulled out of
Nigeria’s Olokola liquefied natural gas plant venture, becoming
at least the second partner to withdraw from the project.  The decision to divest the 23 percent holding is based on
“a review of our investment decision, the lack of progress on
the project, and a reprioritization of resources to focus on
growing domestic gas supply,” Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the U.S. oil company’s Nigeria unit, said today in an
e-mailed statement from Lagos, the commercial capital.  Tumini Green, a spokeswoman in the capital Abuja for state-owned partner Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., didn’t
immediately respond to two phone calls seeking comments.  Last year  BG Group Plc (BG/)  withdrew from the OK LNG project,
formed by NNPC in 2007. The remaining partner,  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA) , pulled out in July, according to the Chevron statement.
Shell’s spokesman in Lagos,  Precious Okolobo , declined to
comment when reached today by Bloomberg News.  NNPC has been informed of Chevron’s decision, and the
divestment process is being managed in line with the terms of
the shareholder agreement, according to the statement.  Chevron, Nigeria’s third-biggest energy producer, said it
remains committed to Nigeria and continues to pursue other
investments in the West African nation’s oil and gas industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
