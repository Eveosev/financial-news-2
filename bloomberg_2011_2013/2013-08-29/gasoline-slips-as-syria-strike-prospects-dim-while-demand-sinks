Gasoline slipped as crude retreated
on fading prospects for an imminent strike against  Syria  by the
U.S. and its allies and as the end of the U.S. summer driving
season looms.  Futures slid as much as 0.9 percent. The U.K. and  France 
said they favor waiting for results from a United Nations
investigation into alleged use of chemical weapons by Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad against his own people. The U.S. won’t
act without allies, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said today.
U.S. gasoline  demand  slipped to a five-week low in the seven
days ended Aug. 23, government data show.  “The market got ahead of itself as did the politicians,
and there seems to be a little bit of a pullback from the
brink,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline for September delivery fell 1.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $3.0795 a gallon at 10:21 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 21 percent below the
100-day average.  Supplies of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB, along the U.S.
East Coast, where Nymex futures are delivered, rose 687,000
barrels last week to 17 million, 8 percent higher than a year
ago. Demand for the motor fuel in the U.S. typically declines
after the Labor Day holiday, which falls on Sept. 2 this year,
as the weather cools and students head back to school.  Higher Inventories  “Gasoline inventories are higher than last year. As for
demand, once this weekend is over, that’s about it,” Armstrong
said.  Gasoline settled at the highest level since July 19
yesterday as  Brent crude  reached a six-month high on concern
that a strike on Syria would ignite regional tensions and
disrupt oil supplies. The UN’s investigators will continue their
on-site probe tomorrow, leave Syria by early Aug. 31 “and
report to me as soon as they come out,” Secretary-General Ban
Ki-moon told reporters in Vienna today.  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude rose 7 cents to $14.36 a barrel. The fuel’s
 premium  over Brent was unchanged at $7.78.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 1.8 cents to $3.564
a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
That’s the biggest increase since July 16. Prices are 24 cents
below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery fell 0.69
cent to $3.2014 a gallon, after reaching a six-month high
yesterday. Trading volume was 12 percent below the 100-day
average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 47 cents to $25.25 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose 39 cents to $18.66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
