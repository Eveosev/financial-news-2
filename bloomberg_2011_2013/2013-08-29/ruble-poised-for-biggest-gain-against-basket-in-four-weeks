The ruble strengthened against the
central bank’s basket of currencies, heading for the biggest
advance in four weeks. Government bonds rose.  The ruble advanced 0.3 percent to 38.0744 versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket by 2:26 p.m. in Moscow, poised
for its strongest daily gain on a closing basis since Aug. 2.
The yield on the government’s ruble debt due February 2027 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.03 percent.  A slowdown in a sell-off of the Indian rupee and the
Indonesian rupiah after the countries’ central banks acted to
support the currencies and a correction in the euro versus the
dollar helped the ruble against the basket today, OAO  Rosbank (ROSB) 
analysts headed by Vladimir Kolychev said in an e-mailed note.
The rupee snapped three days of declines, rebounding from a
record low against the dollar, while the rupiah strengthened 2.9
percent.  The ruble was unchanged against the dollar at 33.2100 and
advanced 0.6 percent against the euro to 44.0200.  Russia ’s central bank sold 13.27 billion rubles ($399
million) of foreign currency on Aug. 27, bringing the total
amount spent since May 29 to almost 432 billion rubles.  With the central bank offering $7 billion to $8 billion in
the foreign exchange market a month, the ruble may continue to
outperform other emerging-markets currencies, VTB Capital
analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin said in an e-mailed
note. The ruble has lost 11 percent in spot terms from this
year’s peak compared with drops of more than 15 percent for the
Brazilian real, Turkey lira and South African rand, they said.  “We do not see any reasons for the ruble to follow the
same disorderly depreciation path as rupee and rupiah,” Korovin
and Nikitin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
