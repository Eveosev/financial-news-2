The Ministry of the Environment  is
requesting 43.5 billion yen ($443 million) in next fiscal year’s
budget to create a low-carbon society using clean energy.  The amount includes 2 billion yen to subsidize part of the
cost to put together business plans and buy equipment for
geothermal power producers, according to the ministry’s budget
request released today.  The ministry is also requesting 70 billion yen for a clean
energy fund for the year starting April 1. The fund was set up
in July with an initial budget of 1.4 billion yen.  The fund is intended for investment in clean energy
projects to support regional companies and reduce carbon dioxide
emissions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
