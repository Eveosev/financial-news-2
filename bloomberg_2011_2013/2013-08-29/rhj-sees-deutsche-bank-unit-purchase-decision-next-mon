RHJ International (RHJI) , the investment
firm seeking to buy  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s BHF-Bank unit, said
German banking regulator Bafin will probably decide whether to
approve the transaction by the end of next month.  RHJ and all except one of its co-investors have submitted
the necessary filings for the German wealth manager to Bafin,
according to a  statement  on the Brussels-based firm’s website
today. The watchdog has started a “material review,” it said.  RHJ, led by Chief Executive Officer Leonhard Fischer,
entered talks with Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank more than two
years ago to acquire BHF-Bank to expand its array of financial
services. Should the transaction fail to proceed, RHJ “will
consult with shareholders on the timing, mechanism and quantum
of a proposed capital return,” it said.  Deutsche Bank has sought a buyer for BHF-Bank since
acquiring it through the purchase of Sal. Oppenheim Group in
2010. RHJ reached an agreement with Deutsche Bank to buy the
business for 384 million euros ($509 million) in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
