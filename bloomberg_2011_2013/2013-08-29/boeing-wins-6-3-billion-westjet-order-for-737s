WestJet Airlines Ltd. (WJA)  agreed to
purchase 65  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 Max planes with a list value of $6.3
billion, helping bolster the carrier’s edge over Air Canada in
using  fuel efficiency  to reduce costs.  The 737 Max will decrease fuel burn and carbon dioxide
emissions by 13 percent compared with the most efficient single-aisle jets currently on the market, Calgary-based WestJet,
Canada’s second-largest carrier, said in a statement today.  As oil prices touch five-year highs this week, WestJet
Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky is counting on a fuel-efficient fleet as part of a plan to cut expenses by C$100
million ($95 million) by the end of 2015. WestJet’s fuel cost
per available seat mile, a measure of efficiency, was 4.5 cents
last year, compared to  Air Canada (AC/A) ’s gauge of 5.3 cents,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “When I look at WestJet I’m seeing a huge cost
advantage,” Chris Hensen, a  fund manager  at Manulife Asset
Management Ltd., which oversees about C$1 billion, said by phone
from Toronto before today’s release. “Air Canada has closed the
gap a bit but it’s still there.”  WestJet, which is tied with JetBlue Airways Corp. for
having the youngest fleet in the Americas, signed a letter of
intent to purchase 40 of the 737 Max 8 planes and 25 of the 737
Max 7, according to the statement. Delivery for the new planes
is scheduled to start in September 2017, the company said.
WestJet plans to make a purchase agreement before Sept. 30 of
this year.  Younger Fleet  This upgrade substitutes 15 of WestJet’s current 737 plane
orders, for a net increase of 50 committed deliveries, WestJet
said. The carrier estimates 2013 capital expenditures will be as
much as C$710 million, up from from its previous projection of a
maximum of C$630 million, according to the statement.  WestJet’s fleet, which is comprised mostly of Boeing 737s,
has a mean age of 6.7 years, compared to Air Canada’s average of
12.6 years, the Bloomberg  data  show.  WestJet  slipped  1 percent to C$21.80, while Air Canada
advanced 5.3 percent to C$2.80 at the close in Toronto. Boeing
added 1.6 percent to $104.93 in New York.  CFM International , the joint venture between  General
Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF) , said WestJet also ordered engines
for the planes with a list price of $1.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
