Italian  consumer confidence  rose
this month more than economists expected as households grew
optimistic amid expectations that the government would cut a
property tax.  The  confidence index  increased to 98.3 from a revised 97.4
in July, the Italian statistics office Istat said in Rome today.
Economists had forecast a reading of 97.8, according to the
median of nine projections in a Bloomberg News survey. Istat
surveyed 2,000 Italians in the first half of the month.  Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government yesterday passed a
new fiscal plan canceling the payment of a property levy on
first homes for this year and refinancing an income-support
scheme for unemployment. Still, the efforts by the government to
revive the euro region’s third-biggest economy have failed so
far to succeed. Italy remained in recession in the second
quarter even as the broader euro area returned to growth.  Joblessness stayed in June near a record high as businesses
were reluctant to hire amid the nation’s longest slump since the
World War II. Retail sales fell in the same month after rising
in May for the first time in a year, Istat said yesterday.  Istat originally reported the consumer confidence index at
97.3 in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
