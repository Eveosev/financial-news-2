Admiral Group Plc (ADM) , the U.K. motor
insurer that owns the confused.com website, raised its dividend
8 percent as it posted better-than-expected first-half profit.  Pretax profit climbed 5.6 percent to 181.4 million pounds
($282 million) from the year-earlier period, the Cardiff, Wales-based insurer said today in a statement. That beat the 177.2
million-pound  estimate  of 14 analysts provided by the company.
The interim dividend rose to 48.9 pence a share.  “Any time you can increase profits when competitors are
cutting prices you’ve got to be happy,” Chief Executive Officer
Henry Engelhardt said in the statement. “We are poised to meet
our expectations for the full year.”  Admiral, which insures about 3.6 million vehicles mainly in
the U.K., is slowing its growth in its home market as prices
fall after reaching an all-time high in 2012. The company, which
has gained about 11 percent this year, said first-half profit
was helped by “excellent claims experience.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
