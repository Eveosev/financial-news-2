Brazil ’s population will surpass 200
million this year for the first time, and will continue rising
longer than previously estimated as members of the nation’s
expanding middle class live longer than their parents.  The estimate comes from a  report  published today by the
national statistics agency that shows the population will peak
at 228.4 million in 2042 -- three years later than estimated in
the previous study from 2008 -- before stabilizing at about 218
million in 2060.  As Brazilian women enter the workforce in larger numbers,
they’re waiting longer to start families and giving birth to
fewer children. The country’s fertility rate has declined
sharply since the 1970s, when women on average had more than
four children, to 1.77 births per woman currently, below the
U.S.  rate  of two per woman in 2009. In 2034, the rate will fall
to 1.5 and stay at that level through 2060, the study found.  At the same time,  life expectancy  has grown to an average
71.3 years for men and 78.5 years for women. By 2041, both men
and women will be living beyond the age of 80, according to the
study, which was based on census data  The central bank has regularly highlighted the economic
benefits reaped from Brazil’s so-called demographic bonus,
whereby more people enter the workforce each year than leave it,
making it easier for governments and families to save. As the
population ages, and greater access to medical care allows
Brazilians to live as long as wealthier populations in  Europe ,
the opposite takes place, as demands for health care and
pensions strain budgets.  Brazil’s population will reach 201 million this year, the
study found. In 2008, it was forecast to surpass 200 million in
2015.  Brazil is the fifth most populous country in the world,
surpassed only by  China ,  India , the U.S. and Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
