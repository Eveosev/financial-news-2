Dry weather in Eritrea delayed crop
growth “substantially” this season in the eastern African
nation and eroded pastures needed to feed livestock, the
European Union’s crop-monitoring service said.  Drier-than-normal weather in July postponed the start of
the so-called Kremti rainy season, which usually runs from late
June to September, the EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources
unit said in an online  report  today. Crops and pastures are in
“poor and very poor condition” in main growing regions in
Eritrea’s southwest, according to the report.  “The dry weather affected not only crop development, but
had also an effect on cultivated area,” MARS said. “Abundant
rains of early August have improved the situation, but the
negative effect of the delay on this year’s harvest will not be
completely reversed.”  While most of Eritrea’s north and southeast is too dry for
agriculture, about 56 percent of its land area is used for
raising livestock and 5 percent for growing rain-fed arable
crops including grain, MARS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
