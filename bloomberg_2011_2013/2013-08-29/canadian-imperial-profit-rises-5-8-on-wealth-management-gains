Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-largest lender by assets, said third-quarter
profit rose 5.8 percent, lifted by its wealth-management unit.  Net income for the quarter ended July 31 climbed to C$890
million ($847 million), or C$2.16 a share, compared with C$841
million, or C$2, a year earlier, the Toronto-based company said
today in a statement.  Adjusted profit excluding some items was C$2.29 a share,
the bank said, beating the C$2.13  average estimate  of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  CIBC advanced 0.3 percent to C$80.44 in Toronto trading
yesterday. The shares have climbed 0.6 percent this year,
 compared  with a 5.7 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Financials Index of 45 Canadian companies over that same period.  CIBC is the fourth of the country’s biggest six banks to
disclose quarterly results this week.  Bank of Montreal (BMO) ,  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS) , and  National Bank of Canada (NA)  each reported earnings
that beat analyst estimates.  (CIBC will hold a conference call to discuss results at +1-416-340-2217 or +1-866-696-5910 passcode 3201624 starting at
8:30 a.m. Toronto time.)  To contact the reporters on this story:
