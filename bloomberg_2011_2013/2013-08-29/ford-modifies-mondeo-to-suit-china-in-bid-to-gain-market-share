Ford Motor Co. (F)  made changes and
added features to its mid-sized sedan to woo China consumers as
it aims to more than double market share there by 2015 and
compete against segment leaders  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)   Ford is introducing the revamped Mondeo, priced from
179,800  yuan  ($29,400) to 265,800 yuan, today, said Trevor Worthington, vice president of product development in the Asia
Pacific region. The automaker expects to sell between 70,000 to
110,000 units of the model a year, he said.  Sales of the second-largest U.S. carmaker in China jumped
50 percent in the first seven months of this year as it benefits
from expanding its lineup and doubling production capacity in
the country. Ford, which has lagged behind  General Motors Co. (GM)  in
the world’s largest auto market, is counting on the refurbished
Mondeo to take on Volkswagen’s Magotan and Passat, Toyota’s
Camry,  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Accord,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Teana, and
GM’s Buick Regal and Lacrosse.  “We do see ourselves with this vehicle as being a volume
player that appeals to a range of different people,”
Worthington said in an interview in Shanghai. “There are unique
requirements that a customer has that perhaps U.S. customers or
European customers haven’t, so it’s our job to make sure that
from an appearance, craftmanship perspective, that all of those
things are able to be taken into account.”  Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, had annual sales of
fewer than 70,000 units of its earlier versions of the Mondeo in
China from 2008 to 2012, according to data from researcher LMC
Automotive. Mondeo is sold as the Fusion in the U.S.  Fuel Efficiency  “The Mondeo will do well against the others in the
category,” said  Yale Zhang , Shanghai-based managing director of
consultancy Autoforesight Shanghai Co. “The Japanese used to
dominate because of their reputation for  fuel efficiency , but
the Americans and Europeans have now caught up, and even
surpassed them, with cutting edge design and powertrain
technology.”  The Mondeo’s overall fuel consumption of 6.9 liters per 100
kilometers on its 1.5 liter EcoBoost turbocharged direct
injection gasoline engine compares with the Passat’s 5.7 liters
per 100 kilometers on its 2.0 TSI engine, traveling at 90
kilometers per hour.  The Passat was the top-selling model in the category last
year at 210,567 units and continues to lead with 137,421
vehicles delivered in the first seven months of the year,
according to data from LMC Automotive. VW’s Magotan followed the
Passat in beating others in its class in 2012 and the first
seven months of this year.  Design Changes  Ford, which aims to reach 6 percent of  China ’s market share
by 2015, had about 2.5 percent of the market last year,
according to LMC Automotive. GM had 15.6 percent share of the
market, while Volkswagen had 14.5 percent, it said.  The  automaker  took at least three years of market research
with more than 700 potential customers to come up with ideas to
modify the Mondeo’s design and features to appeal to Chinese
consumers, Worthington said.  In the China version of the car Ford has included LED
headlights, enabled control of cabin music as well as
adjustments to the front passenger seat by those sitting in the
rear seats, Worthington said. The shape of the taillights has
been changed to a circle instead of a C-shape as it appeals more
to Chinese customers culturally, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
