The U.S. Energy Department is
providing $16 million to back 17 projects related to capturing
power from waves and tides.  The recipients include  Ocean Power Technologies Inc. (OPTT) , which
is developing a power buoy that produces electricity;  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) ,
which is building a compact generator; the University of Maine,
which is studying the reactions of marine life to power systems;
and Dehlsen Associates LLC, which is designing software to
predict wave conditions.  The agency has identified as much as 1,400 potential
terawatt-hours of annual generating capacity from waves and
tides, according to a  statement  today on the agency’s website.
One terawatt-hour could power about 85,000 homes.  “Wave and tidal energy represent a large, untapped
resource,” David Danielson, assistant secretary for energy
efficiency and renewable energy, said in the statement. The U.S.
uses about 4,000 terawatt-hours annually, according to the
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
