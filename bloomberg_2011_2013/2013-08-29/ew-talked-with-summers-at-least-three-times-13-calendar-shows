U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
has met or talked with Harvard professor  Lawrence Summers , a
candidate to become the next Federal Reserve chairman, at least
three times this year, according to a  calendar  released today of
Lew’s meetings and phone calls.  Lew held talks with Summers on March 19, the calendar
shows. The call was place to Summers while Lew was traveling in
China and a financial crisis was unfolding in Cyprus. The others
listed were meetings in Lew’s office April 5 and June 4, the
records show.  The Treasury chief also met with former Fed Vice Chairman
 Donald Kohn , on March 22, the calendar showed. Kohn was
mentioned last month by President Barack Obama as another
possible contender to replace Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ,
whose term ends Jan. 31.  The calendar, portions of which were redacted, doesn’t show
that Lew has had calls or meetings with Janet Yellen, the Fed’s
current vice chairman who is also in the running to get the top
job.  The records released today, from February through July 31,
also showed Lew had conversations with former Treasury
secretaries other than Summers, including Robert Rubin,  Henry Paulson  and Timothy F. Geithner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
