OPEC  crude production climbed for a
second month in August as  Saudi Arabia  pumped barrels at the
fastest pace in at least 24 years, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Output by the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increased 116,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to an
average 31.04 million barrels a day this month from a revised
30.924 million in July, the survey of  oil companies , producers
and analysts showed. The July total was revised higher by
262,000 barrels a day because of changes to estimates for Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Iraq and Ecuador.  Saudi output climbed 150,000 barrels to 9.95 million
barrels a day in August, the sixth straight gain and the highest
for OPECâ€™s biggest supplier in monthly data going back to 1989.
It was the biggest gain of any OPEC member this month.  Libyan output  tumbled 225,000 barrels to 575,000 barrels a
day this month, the survey showed. It was the fifth straight
decline and sent production to the lowest level since October
2011. Two years after the war that swept the late  Muammar Qaddafi  from power, Libyan government efforts to revive the oil
industry are being stymied by feuding militias and protests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
