Juliette has weakened to a tropical
depression in the  Pacific Ocean  off the coast of  Mexico ’s Baja
California, according to the U.S.  National Hurricane Center .  It was located 130 miles (209 kilometers) northwest of Cabo
San Lazaro, Mexico, with top sustained winds of 35 miles per
hour, the center said in an advisory at about 5 p.m.  New York 
time. A system must maintain winds of at least 39 mph to be
classified as a tropical storm.  “Additional weakening is forecast during the next 24
hours,” according to the Miami-based center. “Juliette is
expected to become a remnant low tonight or early Friday.”  It is the 10th storm of the eastern Pacific hurricane
season, which runs from May 15 to Nov. 30.  Forecasters are tracking two areas of disorganized
thunderstorms in the Atlantic. One of the clusters off the coast
of  Africa  has a 30 percent chance of becoming a tropical system
in two days, while the other in the central Atlantic has a 10
percent chance, according to the hurricane center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
