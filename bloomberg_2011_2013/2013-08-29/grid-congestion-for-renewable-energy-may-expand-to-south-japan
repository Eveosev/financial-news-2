Power grids in southern Japan are
close to capacity for solar and wind projects as the country
pushes to add stations that derive power from clean energy.  Chugoku Electric Power Co. (9504)  and  Kyushu Electric Power Co. (9508) 
each have less than 1 gigawatt of available grid capacity for
solar or wind projects after deducting existing and approved
capacity, according to estimates by Bloomberg New Energy Finance
released yesterday.  The study coincides with a debate about how to fix grid
congestion on Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan.
 Hokkaido Electric Power Co. (9509) , the island’s sole utility, says
applications for large-scale solar plants have surged since
Japan began offering inducements to promote clean energy,
leaving it with more proposed capacity than its grid can handle.  Japan has approved 22.4 gigawatts of renewable energy
capacity since an incentive program began in July 2012,
according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. BNEF
estimates  Japan  has 34 gigawatts of technical grid availability
for new solar and wind projects.  Reform of the power market could improve the country’s
grid, the London-based researcher said in the report. Such a
bill is expected to be submitted to parliament in the autumn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
