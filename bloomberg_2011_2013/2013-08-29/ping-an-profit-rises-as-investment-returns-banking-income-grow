Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (2318) ,
 China ’s second-largest insurer, said first-half profit rose 28.3
percent as investment income expanded and earnings from banking
operations grew.  Net income  climbed to 17.91 billion  yuan  ($2.93 billion),
or 2.26 yuan a share, from 13.96 billion yuan, or 1.76 yuan a
share, a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company said in a
statement to the Shanghai stock exchange today.  Ping An joins peers including China Life Insurance Co. in
improving investment returns from a bull run in the benchmark
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  early this year. An 11.4 percent profit
increase at its banking unit amid the nation’s economic slowdown
also helped China’s most diversified major insurer bolster
earnings.  “Ping An’s profit should increase from the relatively low
basis a year earlier, benefiting mainly from higher investment
returns and banking profit,” Olive Xia, a Shanghai-based
analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Ltd., said before
the results. “The second half should also see a profit increase
year on year although underwriting profitability in the non-life
business faces quite some pressure.”  Investment Income almost doubled to 26.44 billion yuan,
Ping An said.  Net investment income, mainly comprised of
interest and dividends, rose 24 percent to 25.97 billion yuan.
Impairment losses from investments, which more than doubled last
year, narrowed by 73 percent to 1.05 billion yuan in the first
half, according to the statement.  Bull Market  After falling about 20 percent in the past two years, the
Shanghai Composite entered a  bull market  on Jan. 29, surging 20
percent from a December low. The gauge tumbled 13 percent in the
first half as the nation’s  economic expansion  slowed, and has
rallied 5.1 percent since June 30.  China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the nation’s largest insurer,
said yesterday profit jumped 68 percent in the first half as
investment income rose and impairment losses dropped. China
Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., the third-largest, said net
income more than doubled after impairments from investments
dropped 80 percent.  Ping An Bank Co., a unit, said Aug. 22 that profit rose to
7.5 billion yuan in the first half as loan margins improved and
non-interest income jumped 41 percent.  New business value, which measures the profitability of new
life policies sold, increased 14.2 percent, according to the
statement.  The combined ratio of Ping An’s non-life insurance unit,
used to measure claims and expenses as a percentage of premiums
earned, was 95.5 percent, according to the statement. Bigger
 PICC Property & Casualty Co. (2328)  on Aug. 26 reported a 1.2
percentage point increase in the gauge to 93.6 percent as
competition intensified.  The solvency margin, which gauges an insurer’s ability to
settle claims, was 162.7 percent, Ping An said.  The  stock  rose 1.2 percent to HK$53.85 in  Hong Kong ,
trimming this year’s decline to 17 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
