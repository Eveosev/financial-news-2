German stocks  advanced, snapping a
two-day decline for the  DAX (DAX)  Index, as investors awaited reports
on U.S. economic growth and jobless claims.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Continental AG (CON)  each rose more than 1
percent, as a gauge of European carmakers climbed on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  Gildemeister AG (GIL)  added 2.8 percent as the maker
of cutting tools said it will sell shares in a rights issue to
fund its expansion in  Russia .  The DAX increased 0.4 percent to 8,189.17 at 9:58 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The gauge has still lost 4.1 percent since May 22 as
the  Federal Reserve  said it may reduce bond purchases if the
economy improves sustainably. The broader HDAX Index rose 0.5
percent today.  German unemployment unexpectedly increased in August for
the first time in three months. The number of people out of work
rose by a seasonally adjusted 7,000 to 2.95 million, the
Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Agency said today. Economists
predicted a decline by 5,000, according to the median of 25
estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey . The  adjusted jobless rate 
stayed at 6.8 percent, near a two-decade low.  In the U.S., revised Commerce Department data at 8:30 a.m.
Washington time may show the economy grew at a 2.2 percent
annualized rate in the second quarter, according to a Bloomberg
News survey, compared with the initial reading of 1.7 percent. A
separate report may show applications for  jobless benefits  fell
by 4,000 to 332,000 last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
