Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR) , the Israeli maker of
wireless communication equipment that sank 81 percent this year,
rose to the highest in a week in New York after requesting court
approval for a buyout by Valley Telecom Ltd.  Shares of Tel Aviv-based Alvarion soared as much as 38
percent to 87 cents, and traded at 69 cents at 2:22 p.m. in New
York. Trading volume was triple the average of the past 90 days.
It climbed 8.8 percent to 2.85 shekels in Tel Aviv.  Yoav Kfir, the court-appointed receiver for Alvarion, has
asked the court to approve Valley Telecom’s bid to buy Alvarion,
according to a statement today. The bid will probably be
approved on Sept. 2, Kfir said.  “It seems like a very good solution for the company,
because it will stay in business and will remain a listed
company,” he said by phone from Tel Aviv today. Alvarion has
already stopped losing money and is at a turning point as
“Valley Telecom will get it to a better place,” Kfir said.  Nasdaq  issued the company with a delisting notice after its
shares dropped below the minimum bid requirement of $1, Alvarion
said on May 1. The stock needs to trade at least $1 for a
minimum 10 consecutive business days by Oct. 23 for the company
to remain in compliance with the exchange’s rules, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
