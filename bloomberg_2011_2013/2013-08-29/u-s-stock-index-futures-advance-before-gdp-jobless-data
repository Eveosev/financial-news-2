U.S.  stocks  rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher for a second day, as data
showed the economy expanded at a faster pace in the second
quarter and concerns over  Syria  eased.  Verizon Communications Inc. added 2.7 percent as Vodafone
Group Plc said the companies are in talks over their Verizon
Wireless venture.  Guess? Inc. (GES)  rallied 13 percent after the

market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, which oversees about
$400 billion, said in a phone interview. “That gives more
evidence why the Fed should ultimately taper. But over the last
couple of months the markets have been a lot more comfortable
with that notion.”  Gross domestic product rose at a 2.5 percent annualized
rate, up from an initial estimate of 1.7 percent, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median

331,000 from a revised 337,000 the week before that was higher
than initially reported, the Labor Department said today in
Washington. The median forecast of 50 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 332,000.  The equity benchmark has fallen 2.8 percent in August amid

its forecasts. Fed stimulus helped  push  the S&P 500 up as much
as 153 percent from its March 2009 low, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The prospect of imminent military strikes on Syria receded
as the U.K. and  France  said they favor waiting for the results
of a United Nations investigation into alleged use of chemical
weapons. The U.S., which says it has evidence that Syria’s
government was responsible, won’t act without allies, Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel said today.  Low Volume  “We’re back to focusing on economic data, specifically out
of the U.S. and Europe, and the Fed tapering, as the market is
coming around to believe the Syrian conflict poses only a short-term risk,” said Manish Singh, who helps oversee $2 billion as
head of investment at Crossbridge Capital in  London . “I am of
the opinion that tapering will happen in September, regardless
of data.”  About 4.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.
