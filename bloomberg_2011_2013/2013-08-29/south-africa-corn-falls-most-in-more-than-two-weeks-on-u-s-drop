Corn futures in  South Africa  fell
the most in more than two weeks following a decline in prices in
the U.S.  Yellow corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 1.6 percent to 2,193 rand ($212) a metric ton
by the midday close on the South African Futures Exchange.
That’s the biggest one-day slump since Aug. 14. The white
variety slipped 1.3 percent to 2,351 rand a ton.  South African prices often follow moves in the U.S., where
corn is the biggest crop. Parts of the Midwest will have cooler
 weather  from the weekend and rain may fall in  Iowa , the top
growing state, National Weather Service data show.  “The U.S. is said to experience cooler temperatures so
their prices went down and we usually follow them,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes
Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s staple
foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for December delivery lost 0.5 percent to 3,431 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
