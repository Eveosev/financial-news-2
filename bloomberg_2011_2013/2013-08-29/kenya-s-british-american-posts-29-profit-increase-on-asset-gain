British-American Investments Co., a
Kenyan financial-services company, said net income in the first
half of this year advanced 29 percent after it realized gains on
financial assets.  Net income surged to 2.16 billion shillings ($24.7 million)
in the six months through June from 1.68 billion shillings a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement e-mailed by
the Nairobi Securities Exchange.  The company’s businesses include asset management,
insurance, banking and private equity, and have benefited from
the Kenyan stock market’s rally. Kenyan stocks are the second-best performers in  Africa  this year, trailing only Ghanaian
equities.  Revenue grew 38 percent to 7.99 billion shillings, the
company said, while gains from financial assets amounted to
333.8 million shillings compared with 2.06 million shillings a
year earlier.  Shares in Britam, as the company is known, rose 1.3 percent
in Nairobi trading. They have rallied 33 percent this year,
outpacing the 25 percent gain by the FTSE-NSE 25-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
