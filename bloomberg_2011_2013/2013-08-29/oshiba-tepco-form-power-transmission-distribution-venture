Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501)  will set up a venture for power transmission and
distribution systems for markets outside Japan.  Toshiba will take an 85.1 percent in the venture to be set
up on Sept. 2 while Tokyo Electric, operator of the wrecked
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant, will hold the remaining
stake, the companies said in a statement.  The venture will provide engineering support for power
transmission and distribution projects. Support will initially
be provided to projects promoted by Toshiba, which acquired
Swiss electronic-metering company Landis+Gyr AG in 2011,
according to today’s statement.  The new company will integrate Toshiba’s technologies in
power transformation and power grid solutions with  Tokyo 
Electric’s know-how in grid planning, system design, operation
and maintenance, said the companies, which are both based in
Tokyo.  Toshiba and Tepco, as the utility is known, will target
markets from advanced nations to emerging economies such as
India, and South Asian and Latin American countries, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
