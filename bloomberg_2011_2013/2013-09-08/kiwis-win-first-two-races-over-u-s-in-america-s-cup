Emirates Team New Zealand has the
lead over defending-champion Oracle Team USA going into the
second day of races in the 34th America’s Cup championship.  The Kiwis won Race 1 by 36 seconds yesterday and followed
with a 52-second win in Race 2 on San Francisco Bay.  “For us, it couldn’t have been a better start,” said Dean
Barker, skipper of the New Zealand yacht. “I’m really proud of
the way the guys sailed. The boat was spot-on today.”  The teams are competing in a best-of-17 series. New Zealand
needs seven more wins to claim the trophy.  The Oracle team must win 11 races to retain the cup after
being penalized two races when it was found to have made
improper modifications to the smaller 45-foot yachts used is
last year’s America’s Cup World Series.  The 72-foot catamarans return to the course today for two
races.  To contact the reporter on this story:
