Rookie quarterback Geno Smith passed
for 256 yards and a touchdown as the  New York  Jets beat the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers 18-17 for their third straight opening-game
victory at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  Smith led the Jets on five-play, 50-yard drive to set up
the go-ahead field goal by  Nick Folk  from 48 yards out with two
seconds left in the game. The key play in the drive was a 15-yard penalty assessed against Tampa Bayâ€™s Lavonte David for
hitting Smith after he had run out of bounds.  The Buccaneers have now lost to the Jets 10 times in 11
meetings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
