Thomas Bjorn won on the opening
playoff hole to take golf’s European Masters after his opponent
Craig Lee missed a last-hole birdie putt that would have given
him his first tour victory.  Denmark’s Bjorn and Lee of  Scotland  finished level on 20-under par 264 at Crans-sur-Sierre, Switzerland, after shooting
final rounds of 65 and 67, respectively. Lee, 36, had been the
overnight leader after a 61 yesterday.  Bjorn, 42, picked up a check for 366,660 euros ($483,000)
with his first win since victory at the event two years ago and
his 14th overall on the European Tour.  “It was nice, I had a really good run through the summer
and did not really get close enough,” Bjorn told the Tour
website. “I had to grit my teeth for a while and I really
wanted to get out and try to win a golf tournament again.”  To contact the reporter on for this story:
