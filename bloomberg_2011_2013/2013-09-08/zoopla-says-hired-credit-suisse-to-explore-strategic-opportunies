Zoopla Property Group Ltd., an
online property website company, has hired Credit Suisse Group
AG to identify strategic options for growth.  “We work with various advisers and have recently engaged
Credit Suisse to help us explore further strategic opportunities
as we continue to grow,” Lawrence Hall, a London-based
spokesman, said by e-mail today.  The company is studying an initial public offering and may
be worth as much as 1.3 billion pounds ($2.03 billion), the
Sunday Times reported today, citing unidentified bankers.
Zoopla, which owns property portals Zoopla.co.uk and
PrimeLocation.com, said last week it bought Trinity Mirror
Digital Property Ltd., which also runs several real estate
websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
