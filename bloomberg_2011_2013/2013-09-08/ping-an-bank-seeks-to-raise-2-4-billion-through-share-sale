Ping An Bank Co. (000001) , the least-capitalized among China’s 17 publicly traded lenders, plans to
sell 14.8 billion  yuan  ($2.4 billion) of stock to its
controlling shareholder to bolster its financial strength.  Ping An Insurance Group Co. (2318)  will buy about 1.32 billion
shares at 11.17 yuan each in a private placement, the Shenzhen-based insurer said in an exchange filing yesterday. The
subscription price is about 1.3 percent higher than Ping An
Bank’s Sept. 5 closing value.  The sale, smaller than an earlier announced plan, adds to a
round of fundraising by Chinese lenders, which have announced
equity and bond sales this year seeking as much as 327 billion
yuan as capital rules tighten. Ping An Bank is seeking to
bolster its balance sheet and speed up branch expansion to cope
with growing competition from rivals such as  China Merchants
Bank Co. (600036)  and  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)   “The new plan is less than the market expected and not
enough to completely relieve Ping An Bank’s capital shortage,”
said Tang Yayun, a Shanghai-based analyst at Northeast
Securities Co., who rates the stock a buy. “It needs to sell
more debt to boost supplementary capital, or retain more
earnings to meet the new rules.”  The bank’s shareholders in September 2011 approved a plan
to raise 20 billion yuan by selling shares to Ping An Insurance.
The authorization was extended for a year in 2012 and expired
this month.  Shares Rise  Banking shares surged in  Shanghai  today after Money Week
reported that the securities regulator has held meetings with
banks on allowing them to sell preferred shares.  Agricultural
Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (600000)  Co. may
be the first to issue the securities, the report said.  Ping An Bank rose 6.9 percent, the biggest intraday advance
in three weeks, to 11.79 yuan at 10:01 a.m. in Shenzhen. Ping An
Insurance gained 2.7 percent to 36.75 yuan in Shanghai.  The share sale is awaiting regulatory approval, Ping An
Insurance said. The transaction will help the bank boost its
capital adequacy ratios to meet “increasingly strict”  capital
requirements  from the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the
Shenzhen-based lender said in a separate statement.  It will also help the bank handle risk in a fast-changing
domestic and external economic environment, Ping An Bank said.  Three Arms  Ping An Insurance is buying the new shares to accelerate
growth in its banking business, and to improve cross-selling
between its insurance, banking and investment arms, China’s
second-biggest insurer said. The stake held by the company and
its affiliates would rise to 59 percent from about 52 percent.  Merchants Bank (3968) , the nation’s sixth-largest lender by market
value, said Sept. 4 it raised 27.5 billion yuan in the Shanghai
portion of a rights offer, paving the way for it to complete the
world’s third-largest share sale this year.  The share sale would help improve the bank’s capital
adequacy ratio to 9.97 percent at the end of the year, according
to Ping An Insurance, which cited unidentified market analysts.
The lender’s core capital adequacy ratio may increase to 8.83
percent, the parent company said.  Ping An Bank said it targets a minimum capital adequacy
ratio of 10.5 percent between 2013 and 2016, with a core tier-1
ratio of 8.5 percent at least.  Its capital adequacy ratio fell to 8.78 percent as of June
30, and its core tier-1 ratio stood at 7.29 percent. Both
measures ranked the lowest among the nation’s listed lenders.  Capital Rules  Under capital rules that took effect in  China  Jan. 1, non-systemically important lenders such as Ping An Bank must have a
minimum core tier-1 ratio of 5.5 percent, a tier-1 ratio of 6.5
percent and a total ratio of 8.5 percent by the end of 2013.
Those levels will rise by 0.4 percentage point a year for the
following five years.  The deal will need the approval of Ping An Bank
shareholders and regulators including the CBRC and China
Insurance Regulatory Commission. Ping An Insurance will finance
the buyout using internal capital and would be restricted from
transferring the new shares for three years.  Ping An Bank shareholders approved a plan in May to issue
no more than 50 billion yuan of Tier-2 debt in the next three
years, which will further boost its  capital ratios , Ping An
Insurance said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
