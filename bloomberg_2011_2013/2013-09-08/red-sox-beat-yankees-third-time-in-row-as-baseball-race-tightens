Mike Napoli  hit two homers and Jonny Gomes drove in four runs as the Boston Red Sox won 13-9 to hand
the New York Yankees their third straight loss in the Major
League Baseball.  The Red Sox (87-57) lead the American League East, 11 games
ahead of the fourth-place Yankees (75-67). New York also failed
to gain ground in the race for the AL’s wild-card spots, which
go to the two non-division winners with the best records.  Napoli, who drove in three runs, hit a two-run home run in
the second inning yesterday, while Gomes had a three-run homer
in the third inning for a 5-1 Red Sox lead at Yankee Stadium.  “Right now, they’re not missing pitches,” Yankees manager
 Joe Girardi  said referring to the Red Sox batters.  The Yankees, trailing by 12-3 after the fifth inning,
scored four runs in the sixth on  Brett Gardner ’s two-run double
and run-scoring singles by  Derek Jeter  and Alfonso Soriano.  Mark Reynolds  hit a two-run double in the eighth to bring
the Yankees within three before Napoli added a solo home run in
the ninth.  Boston’s  John Lackey  (9-12) gave up seven runs on eight
hits and struck out six in 5 2/3 innings. Yankee starter David Huff (2-1) allowed nine runs on eight hits while striking out
two in 3 1/3 innings.  Jeter was pulled from the game after reaching first in the
sixth inning when manager Joe Girardi became concerned about his
ankle. Jeter’s scan of the left ankle that had been fractured a
year ago was negative. The team is seeking an opinion from the
surgeon who repaired the 39-year-old shortstop’s ankle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
