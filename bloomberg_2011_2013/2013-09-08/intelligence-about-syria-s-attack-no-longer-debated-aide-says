White House Chief of Staff  Denis
McDonough  said “nobody now debates” U.S. intelligence showing
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is responsible for a deadly
chemical attack near Damascus last month.  McDonough, in an interview today on CNN’s “State of the
Union” broadcast, said Congress when it considers President
 Barack Obama ’s request for military action needs to determine
“should there be consequences” for the Aug. 21 attack that
killed more than 1,400 people.  “He is responsible for this and should be held
accountable,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
