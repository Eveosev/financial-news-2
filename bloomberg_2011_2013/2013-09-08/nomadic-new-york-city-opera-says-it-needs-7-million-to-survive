New York City Opera  said it must
raise $7 million this month or the season’s first production may
be the last.  General Manager  George Steel ’s appeal comes two years after
he began “dismembering” the company, in the words of
protesters such as director Hal Prince, by slashing productions
and abandoning its Lincoln Center home.  The once-venerable institution, founded in 1943, has taken
to the online fundraising service  Kickstarter  to raise $1
million of the $7 million, the opera said in a release. As of
4:35 p.m. eastern time, it had raised $6,430 from 59 backers.  “We have reached a crossroads: simply put, we need
capitalization, both for the rest of this season and for the
company to continue forward on solid financial footing,” Steel
said in a statement.  The opera needs an additional $13 million by year-end to
pay for future seasons, it said.  “Anna Nicole” is to begin Sept. 17 at the  Brooklyn 
Academy of Music. The show about the surgically enhanced heiress
Anna Nicole Smith had a well-reviewed premiere at  London ’s Royal
Opera House. The remainder of the season is scheduled for the El
Museo del Barrio in upper  Manhattan , St. Ann’s Warehouse in
Brooklyn and New York City Center.  In 2011-12, NYCO received $9.7 million in grants and
contributions, half of the amount of five years earlier,
according to audited financial statements. Ticket sales in 2011-12 were $1.1 million, down two-thirds from the previous season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
