Top-seeded  Serena Williams  has won
the first set 7-5 against second-seeded  Victoria Azarenka  in a
wind-swept women’s final at the U.S. Open tennis tournament.  Williams, 31, the tournament’s defending champion,
struggled with the swirling wind at Arthur Ashe Stadium before
winning the last three games of the set.  Wind gusts sent napkins flying through the stands and made
Williams’s tennis dress flap as she prepared to hit shots.
Williams had 15 enforced errors and 15 winners in the set.  The National Weather Service said the wind at the start of
the match was blowing at 18 miles per hour (29 kilometers per
hour) at nearly LaGuardia Airport.  Williams, an American, is seeking her fifth singles title
at the National Tennis Center in New York and her 17th Grand
Slam singles title.  Azarenka, 24, from Belarus, lost to Williams in the final
last year and is seeking her first  U.S. Open  championship. She
is a two-time defending champion of the Australian Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
