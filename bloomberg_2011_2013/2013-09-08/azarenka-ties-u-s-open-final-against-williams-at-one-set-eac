Second-seeded Victoria Azarenka won
a second-set tiebreaker against top-seeded  Serena Williams  to
even the wind-swept U.S. Open women’s final at one set apiece.  Azarenka, who lost the first set 7-5, won the tiebreaker
eight points to six and sent the match to a third and decisive
set.  Wind gusts sent napkins flying through the stands and made
Williams’s tennis dress flap as she prepared to hit shots in the
match at the National Tennis Center in New York.  The  National Weather Service  said the wind at the start of
the match was blowing at 18 miles per hour (29 kilometers per
hour) at nearly  LaGuardia Airport .  Williams, an American, is seeking her fifth U.S. Open
championship and her 17th Grand Slam singles title.  Azarenka, 24, from Belarus, lost to Williams in the final
last year and is seeking her first U.S. Open championship. She
is a two-time defending champion of the Australian Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
