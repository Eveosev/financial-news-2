The U.S. took an 8-4 lead over the
team from  Great Britain  and Ireland in the Walker Cup amateur
golf matches in Southampton, New York.  Max Homa, from the  University of California , beat Max Orrin
5-and-3 at the National Golf Links of America as the U.S. team
won the first six singles matches of the day.  The competition is in match play, in which golfers compete
for each hole. Homa led Orrin by an insurmontable five holes
with three to play.  The Walker Cup was first contested at National Golf Links
in 1922. This yearâ€™s tournament will finish today with morning
foursomes and afternoon singles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
