Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  has no plans to
introduce a phone this year, said Drew Herdener, a spokesman for
the Seattle-based e-commerce company.  Technology blog  Jessicalessin.com  reported Sept. 6 that
Amazon will offer a free smartphone. Herdener said in an e-mail
yesterday that if Amazon were to offer a phone in the future,
the device won’t be free.  Amazon has been developing a smartphone that would vie with
Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices that run Google Inc.’s Android
operating system, two people familiar with the plan said last
year.  Foxconn International Holdings Ltd. (2038) , the Chinese mobile-phone maker, has been working with Amazon on creating a phone, a
person with knowledge of the matter said at the time.  Amazon, led by Chief Executive Officer  Jeff Bezos , has been
acquiring patents that cover wireless technology to help it
defend against allegations of infringement, other people
familiar with the situation said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
