Australia  captain Michael Clarke
smashed a century to lift his team to an 88-run win over England
and a 1-0 lead in their best-of-five one-day cricket series.  After the opening match was rained out, Clarke scored 105
off 102 balls yesterday at Old Trafford, Manchester, to help
Australia score 315-7 -- its highest one-day international total
against England in the U.K. George Bailey made 82.  Jos Buttler top scored for the home team with 75, opener
Kevin Pietersen made 60 and Eoin Morgan 54, though seven batsmen
finished in single figures as England was all out for 227 with
5.4 overs remaining. Australia had six different wicket-takers,
led by Clint McKay with 3-47.  The third game is at Edgbaston, Birmingham, in two days.
The teams already split two Twenty20 matches after  England  won
the best-of-five Ashes Test series 3-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
