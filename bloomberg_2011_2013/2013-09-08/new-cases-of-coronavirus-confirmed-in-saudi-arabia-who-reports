The  World Health Organization  says
it has been informed of four more laboratory-confirmed cases of
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection in Saudi
Arabia.  Two of those -- a 41 year-old female healthcare worker from
Riyadh and a 79 year-old woman from Hafar al-Batin province --
have died, WHO said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  A 30 year-old Saudi male healthcare worker from Riyadh and
a 47 year-old Saudi man from Hafar al-Batin province are both
said to be in a critical condition, according to WHO.  Since September 2012, WHO says it has been informed of 114
laboratory-confirmed cases globally of infection with MERS-CoV,
including 54 deaths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
