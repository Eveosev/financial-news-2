Team  New Zealand  leads defending
champion Oracle Team USA 3-0 after the catamarans each won a
race on  San Francisco Bay  during the second day of sailing’s
34th America’s Cup.  The Americans’ victory in yesterday’s second race erased
one of two negative points they were assessed for making
improper modifications to the smaller 45-foot boats used in last
year’s America’s Cup  World Series . They need to win 10 more
races of the best-of-17 series to retain the trophy; New Zealand
needs to capture six more to secure the America’s Cup.  The Kiwis won yesterday’s opening race by 28 seconds and
took the two races the previous day by 36 and 52 seconds. Oracle
won the fourth race by eight seconds, reaching a top speed of 46
knots (53 miles per hour) as winds peaked at 23 knots.  “It’s a real confidence boost for the boys,” U.S. skipper
Jimmy Spithill said. “It feels good to shift the momentum over
to us. We’re going to work hard and come out with the same
attitude on Tuesday.”  The 72-foot catamarans return to the course tomorrow.
Racing is scheduled for Saturdays, Sundays, Tuesdays and
Thursdays, with two races per day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
