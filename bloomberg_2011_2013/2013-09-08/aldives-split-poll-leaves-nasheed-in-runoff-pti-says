Former Maldivian president Mohamed
Nasheed, who was ousted from office last year in what he called
a coup, will face a presidential runoff after failing to win an
outright majority in the polls, the  Press Trust of India  said.  Nasheed received 45.5 percent of the votes in yesterday’s
ballot, the report said citing Election Commissioner Fuwad
Taufeek. His nearest rival was Abdullah Yameen, brother of
former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom while incumbent Mohamed
Waheed had 5 percent of the votes.  Nasheed’s election may create fresh political turmoil as he
had pledged during the campaign to arrest those responsible for
what he called the coup. The Commission of National Inquiry set
up by the government last year found no evidence of a coup,
according to the  CIA Factbook .  The island nation, located near busy shipping lanes, has
been marred by political unrest since Nasheed’s ouster and his
subsequent trial on abuse-of-power charges for ordering the
arrest of a judge.  Under the country’s election laws, if none of the
candidates get more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff
between the top two is required, Press Trust of  India  said.  The Maldives derives almost 30 percent of its gross
domestic product from tourism, according to the  World Bank , and
is renowned for its beaches and scuba diving. The country’s
population is scattered across 200 of its islands southwest of
India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
