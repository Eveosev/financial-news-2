The dollar fell as Treasury  two-year 
yields declined for a second day on speculation lower-than-forecast job growth may prompt the Federal Reserve to be less
aggressive when reducing monetary stimulus.  The yen weakened against its 16 most-traded peers as a
report showed the nation’s economy expanded faster than
initially estimated and as  Tokyo ’s winning bid to host the 2020
Olympics boosted optimism in the government’s policies.
Australia’s dollar touched a six-week high and the South Korean
won climbed to the highest level since May after a report showed
 China ’s exports increased. The Canadian dollar extended gains
after building permits rose to a record in July.  “The dollar has been driven higher by front-end rates,”
 Vassili Serebriakov , a foreign-exchange strategist at BNP
Paribas SA in New York, said in a telephone interview. “The
majority is still looking for tapering, but that view has
probably become more questionable or less clear cut,” he said
of the market’s view of Fed policy.  The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the
greenback against 10 major peers, fell for a second day and
touched its lowest level since Aug. 28 before trading at
1,027.65 at 5 p.m. New York time.  The yen depreciated 0.5 percent to 99.58 per U.S. dollar.
It reached 100.23 on Sept. 6, the weakest level since July 25.
Japan’s currency dropped 1 percent to 131.99 per euro. The
dollar fell 0.6 percent to $1.3255 per euro, after advancing 0.3
percent last week.  Aussie Strength  Australia ’s dollar, which is down 11.2 percent this year,
strengthened after data showed exports rose more than expected
in China, its biggest trading partner. Overseas shipments rose
7.2 percent in August from a year earlier, the General
Administration of Customs said in Beijing yesterday. That
compares with the 5.5 percent median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg and July’s 5.1 percent gain.  China’s  consumer prices  rose 2.6 percent last month from a
year earlier, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics
said today, matching the median economist estimate in a
Bloomberg poll. Premier Li Keqiang is seeking to keep price
gains within 3.5 percent this year.  The Aussie dollar rose 0.5 percent to 92.28 U.S. cents
after touching the strongest since July 29.  South Korea’s currency gained 0.5 percent to 1,086.80
against the greenback after touching 1.086.69, the strongest
level since May 8.  Brazil ’s real advanced 1.3 percent to 2.2761
per dollar after gaining 3.4 percent last week, the most since
January 2012.  Canada Dollar  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.4 percent to C$1.0369
per U.S. dollar.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $20 billion, compared with $19 billion on Sept. 6,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the Australian-dollar versus U.S.-currency exchange rate
amounted to $4 billion, the largest share of trades at 20
percent. Options on the U.S. dollar-yen rate totaled $3.3
billion, or 16 percent.  Aussie-U.S. dollar options trading was 101 percent more
than the average for the past five Mondays at a similar time in
the day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Greenback-yen options
trading was about 9 percent less than average.  Japan Economy  Japan ’s  gross domestic product  rose an annualized 3.8
percent in the second quarter from the previous three months,
compared with a preliminary estimate of 2.6 percent, the Cabinet
Office said in Tokyo today. Japan’s capital, which staged the
1964 Summer Games, beat  Madrid  and Istanbul to win the 2020 host
role, the International Olympic Committee said Sept. 7 in Buenos
Aires.  Combined with gross domestic product data, the report added
to signs Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s package of fiscal
and monetary policies are giving the nation momentum.  “There’s been a lot of talk about the Olympics, the
Chinese trade numbers and the better growth data for Japan,”
said Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International in  London . “However, before we can expect the yen
to hold a move above 100, we are going to need to see a bit more
dollar strength.”  The yen will trade at 105 per dollar in 12 months, Foley
said.  Fed View  The Fed will taper its monthly bond purchases to $75
billion from the current $85 billion pace at its Sept. 17-18
meeting, according to the median estimate of 34 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News on Sept. 6.  The U.S. central bank will keep purchases of mortgage-backed securities at the current $40 billion per month pace,
while cutting Treasury bond buying to $35 billion per month,
from $45 billion, economists said. Last month, analysts
estimated the Fed would reduce purchases to $35 billion in MBS
and $40 billion in Treasuries.  Yields on Treasury two-year notes declined to 0.44 percent
after touching 0.53 percent on Sept. 6, the highest level since
2011.  U.S. payrolls rose by 169,000 last month, less than the
180,000 estimate in a Bloomberg survey, Labor Department figures
showed on Sept. 6. That followed a revised 104,000 increase in
July that was smaller than initially estimated.  The dollar weakened even as President  Barack Obama 
intensified his campaign to persuade a reluctant American public
to back military action against  Syria  and Bashar al-Assad
threatened retaliation “direct and indirect” if the U.S.
attacks.  “You could make the argument the dollar should do well on
risk aversion,” BNP’s Serebriakov said. “But I think here it’s
more about markets already having a positive bias on the
currency and the potential for higher oil prices probably hurts
the dollar more than its helps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
