U.K. Energy Secretary  Ed Davey  will
warn of “hype” over the benefits of fracking for shale gas in
a speech tomorrow, The Sunday Times  reported .  Davey, who is a member of the Liberal Democrat junior
partners in Prime Minister David Cameron’s coalition government,
will say the benefits won’t be felt until 2020 and can’t be at
the expense of environmental protection, according to the
newspaper.  Cameron and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne have
predicted that fracking in the U.K. will cut energy prices and
as a result boost industry and relieve financial pressure on
families. Environmentalists have claimed that it could lead to
increased greenhouse gas emissions and cause other damage to the
environment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
