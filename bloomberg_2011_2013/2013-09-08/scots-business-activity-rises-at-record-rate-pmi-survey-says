Growth in  Scotland ’s private sector
gained momentum with increases in business activity and new work
setting a record, according to a PMI survey for August by the
 Bank of Scotland .  The Bank of Scotland PMI rose to 58.3 last month, its
highest since the bank conducted the survey, up from 56.7 in
July. Services companies led the increase, the bank said today
in an e-mailed statement.  The survey also showed an increase in new business helped
by increased marketing efforts and improved market confidence,
the Bank of Scotland said. Scotland’s jobs market continued to
benefit from growth in the private sector, with employment
rising for the ninth consecutive month and by the most since
June 2007, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
