The  New York  Yankees avoided a four-game sweep against the Boston Red Sox by rallying for a 4-3 win
in the bottom of the ninth after Mariano Rivera blew a save
opportunity in the top of the inning.  Ichiro Suzuki had a one-out single, stole second base,
moved to third on a flyout and scored the winning run on a wild
pitch by Red Sox reliever Brandon Workman yesterday at Yankee
Stadium. The Yankees (76-67) are 2 1/2 games behind Tampa Bay
for the second of the American League’s two wild card playoff
spots.  “If we lose this one, it would have been a big hit
mentally,” Ichiro said through an interpreter. “It would have
been tough. But we did win, and hopefully we can take this win
here, get on a run, and really use it to our advantage.”  The Red Sox, who scored 34 runs in winning the first three
games of the series, had tied the game in the top of the ninth
inning when Will Middlebrooks hit a leadoff home run against
Rivera, who had also pitched the eighth inning. It was the
seventh blown save of the season for Rivera and his second in
his past two games against  Boston .  Mark Reynolds doubled in the Yankees’ first run and
Robinson Cano added a two-run double for the home team. Yankees
captain Derek Jeter sat out the Major League Baseball game with
soreness in his surgically repaired left ankle.  The Red Sox (87-58) still have a 7 1/2-game lead over the
Rays atop the AL East. Tampa Bay beat the Seattle Mariners 4-1
yesterday and is two games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and
Baltimore Orioles for the second AL wild card berth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
