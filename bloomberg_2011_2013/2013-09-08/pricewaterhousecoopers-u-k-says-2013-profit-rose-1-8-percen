PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s U.K.
partnership said profit rose 1.8 percent for the year ended in
June, with its consulting and tax-advisory businesses reporting
the most growth.  Earnings increased to 740 million pounds ($1.2 billion)
from 727 million pounds in the year-earlier period, PwC U.K.
said in an emailed statement today. Profit per partner rose 4
percent to 705,000 pounds from 679,000 pounds.  Consulting revenues rose 9 percent to 478 million pounds,
while sales from advising on taxes increased 3 percent to 680
million. Assurance, which includes PwC U.K.’s auditing practice,
still accounts for the biggest portion of the firm’s business
and grew by 1 percent last year to 969 million pounds.  The firm is “optimistic” about the economic outlook in
the U.K., estimating that the country’s economy will grow 1.3
percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2014, Chairman Ian Powell
said in the statement. Such figures reflect a “new normal” for
the U.S. and western  Europe  that will fail to match the rapid
economic growth experienced before the 2008 financial crisis,
Powell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
