What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that grain
demand may ease amid a slowing global economic recovery and as
warmer, drier weather improves U.S. crop potential, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as stagnant U.S. consumer spending and higher capital
adequacy requirements for the worldâ€™s biggest lenders spurred
concern that commodity demand will decline amid cooling global
growth, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.35
cent to 0.45 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may
open down $1 to up $1 for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as favorable weather boosts the prospects for
global yields and as dry weather aids harvesting of U.S. winter
wheat, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
