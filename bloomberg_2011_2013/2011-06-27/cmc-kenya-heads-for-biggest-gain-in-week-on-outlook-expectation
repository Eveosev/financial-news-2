CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH)  climbed the most
in almost a week on expectation the Kenyan car dealer’s new
management will change the company’s strategy, according to Apex
Africa Ltd.  The stock rose 1.2 percent to 10.8 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the capital, the biggest gain since June 22.  Former Chief Executive Officer Martin Forster left the
company as part of a “normal restructuring” exercise, it said
on March 15. Bill Lay, the former chief executive of General
Motors East Africa Ltd. replaced Forster on June 3 while
Jeremiah Kiereini, who resigned as chairman on March 28, has
since been replaced by Peter Muthoka.  “We have seen a lot of boardroom changes in the last three
months, which means they are getting a new strategy, which the
market seems to be buying into,” George Bodo, an equity
strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa, a brokerage, said in a
phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
