Indonesia ’s rupiah declined to a
seven-week low as concern Greece will fail to meet conditions
for international aid damped demand for emerging-market assets.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional stocks dropped the
most in more than a week as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  seeks lawmakers’ approval on budget cuts before the
nation can tap the next installment from a European Union-led
bailout. Overseas investors reduced holdings of Indonesian
government debt by 2 percent to 233.17 trillion rupiah ($27
billion) in the first four days of last week, according to  data 
from the  finance ministry .  “The market is still very volatile because of the
uncertainties in Europe,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “Investors are
waiting for firm action.”  The rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 8,625 per dollar as of
4:20 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It fell to 8,630 earlier, lowest level since May 6.  The currency’s weakness is “temporary” and is due to the
debt crisis in  Europe  and a deteriorating outlook in the U.S.
economy, Hendar, director of monetary operations at  Bank
Indonesia , said in an interview June 24. Like many Indonesians,
he goes by only one name  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds declined, snapping a
three-day gain. The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021
climbed seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.56
percent, according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
