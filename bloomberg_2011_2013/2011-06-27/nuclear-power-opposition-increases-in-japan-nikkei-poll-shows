Opposition to nuclear power is
increasing in Japan following the crisis at  Tokyo  Electric Power
Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi atomic plant, the Nikkei newspaper
 reported  today, citing the results of its own poll.  A total of 69 percent of respondents oppose the restart of
nuclear reactors currently shut for maintenance, the newspaper
said citing a phone poll of 893 people from June 24 to 26. Some
47 percent of those polled want to reduce the number of atomic
plants, an increase of 5 percent from a month earlier, the paper
said.  Nuclear power accounted for a third of Japan’s electricity
before an earthquake and tsunami on March 11 knocked out cooling
systems at  Tokyo Electric ’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing a
meltdown of three reactors and radiation to leak. Across the
country, 35 of  Japan ’s 54 nuclear reactors are closed for
maintenance, safety checks or disaster recovery.  Japan’s electricity prices may rise 18 percent next fiscal
year without nuclear power, the Nikkei reported in a separate
story today, citing Japan’s Institute of Energy Economics.  Antinuclear protests were held across Japan on June 11,
three months after the Fukushima plant began spewing radiation.
More than 60,000 people marched in demonstrations, including in
Tokyo,  Osaka , Hiroshima and Fukushima, local media reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
