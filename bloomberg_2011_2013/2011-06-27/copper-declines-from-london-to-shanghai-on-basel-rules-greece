Copper dropped in  London  and
 Shanghai  after global regulators increased capital adequacy
requirements for the world’s biggest banks, and on concern
Greece may not meet conditions for a bailout.  Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange lost as
much as 1.1 percent to $8,950 a metric ton, and traded at $8,961
by 2:22 p.m. Singapore time. All six LME metals declined as
Greek lawmakers must approve this week the 78 billion-euro ($110
billion) austerity package to receive a loan payment and future
financing, driving the euro lower against the dollar for a
fourth day.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  agreed this
weekend on additional capital rules for as many as 30 of the
largest banks, prompting speculation that Deutsche Bank AG,
 Germany ’s biggest lender, and UniCredit SpA will be among
European banks that may have to raise additional capital.  “Metals are basically reacting to news flow in the broader
economic environment,” Qin Yongfei, an analyst at Zhongzhou
Futures Co., said from Shandong. “Investor confidence has been
shaken by the debt crisis in Europe and the mood will stay
nervous before Greece gets the money it needs.”  Copper on the Comex in  New York  fell as much as 1.4 percent
to $4.0595 a pound, while metal for September delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange shed as much as 2.4 percent to 66,420
yuan ($10,260) a ton.  The dollar rose for a fourth day against a six-currency
basket including the euro before European finance chiefs decide
on July 3 whether  Greece  has fulfilled conditions for its next
aid payment in order to avoid a default, driving commodities and
equities lower.  Zinc in London declined 1 percent to $2,232 a ton, lead
dropped 1.7 percent to $2,537 a ton and nickel shed 1.2 percent
to $21,880 a ton. Aluminum fell 0.4 percent to $2,489 a ton, and
tin decreased 1.1 percent to $24,690 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
