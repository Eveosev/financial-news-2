Hanwha SolarOne Co., a Chinese maker
of solar panels nearly half-owned by  South Korea ’s Hanwha Group,
which makes a range of products from electronics to explosives,
rose more than 5 percent today after it said it will appoint new
chief executive, financial, technology and commercial officers.  Shares of the Qidong-based company rose as much as 5.6
percent to trade at $6.13 at 10:20 a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading in  New York .  The board announced the appointments, effective July 1, to
strengthen the company’s management system, brand positioning,
research and development and marketing capabilities through
longer-term investment, Hanwha SolarOne said in a statement.  Seoul-based Hanwha Group, which in August bought its 49.9
percent stake in Hanwha SolarOne, then called Solarfun Power
Holdings Co., is replacing the current chief executive Peter Ping and chief financial officer Gareth Kung, who will both step
down.  Ki-Joon Hong, current chairman of the company’s board and
chief executive of Hanwha Chemical Corp., will become the
company’s new chief executive.  Jung Pyo Seo, former chief financial and operating officer
at Forest, Virginia-based Azdel Inc., a Hanwha Chemical
subsidiary, will become chief financial officer. Chris Eberspacher, current president of Hanwha Solar America and
former chief technology officer of  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , will
become chief technology officer. Justin Koo Yung Lee, currently
with Hanwha International in  New Jersey , becomes chief
commercial officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
