Inflation in Djibouti accelerated to
5.2 percent in May as food and fuel costs increased, the
Department of Statistics and Demographic Studies said.  The inflation rate increased from 4.9 percent in April, the
Djibouti-based agency said in an e-mailed statement on June 25.
Prices rose 0.5 percent in the month, it said.  Food costs climbed 0.7 percent from April, while
electricity, gas and other fuels jumped 1.3 percent “because of
an increase in the price of kerosene,” the department said.  Djibouti, which hosts about 2,500 U.S. military personnel
at the  Camp Lemonnier  military base, is a Horn of Africa nation
about the size of the U.S. state of  Massachusetts . The country
has a $982 million economy with fewer than 1 million people that
relies on services related to its strategic location on the Red
Sea, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, according to the
U.S. State Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
