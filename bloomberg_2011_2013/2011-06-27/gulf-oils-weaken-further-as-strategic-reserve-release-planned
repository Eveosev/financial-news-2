Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude oil
weakened to its lowest level in three months, dropping with
other Gulf grades after the Energy Department announced a
release of emergency oil stockpiles.  The U.S. government will release 30 million barrels of
mostly light, sweet, crude from storage facilities along the
Gulf of Mexico, half of a planned 60 million-barrel release
coordinated globally by the  International Energy Agency .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium fell $3.35 to $12.65 over
West Texas Intermediate as of 12:02 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level since
March 25.  The grade was at a premium of $20.35 a barrel the day
before the IEA announcement.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium dropped $2.65 to $12.35 a
barrel over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed $3.85 to $8.15 a barrel, while Poseidon lost $2
to $7.50 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $2.25 to $7 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 80 cents a barrel to
$1.90. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $3.50 to $10.50 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude rose 75 cents to $7.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 75 cents to
$20.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
