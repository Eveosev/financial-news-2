Asian stocks fell by the most in a
week ahead of the release of data that may show the  U.S. economy 
is faltering and on concern Greece won’t pass budget cuts to
meet bailout conditions, hurting the outlook for exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s No. 1 carmaker by sales,
dropped 2.3 percent. Samsung Electronics Co., South Korea’s
biggest exporter of consumer electronics, declined 2 percent in
Seoul after Apple Inc. sued the company charging patent
infringement. Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd., the nation’s
largest lender by market value, slipped 1.3 percent in Sydney
after regulators raised capital adequacy requirements for the
world’s biggest lenders.  “The consumer is the key driver of the U.S. economy, and
if confidence is looking weak, it drags down the whole economy.
said Sydney-based  Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management. “And if the U.S. consumer is struggling, it
basically takes away the market for Asian exports.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 1 percent to 130.86 as
of 7:56 p.m. in  Tokyo , with more than two stocks falling for
each that rose. The gauge tumbled 6.1 percent from this year’s
May 2 high through June 24 amid mounting concern that a slowing
U.S. economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and  China ’s steps
to curb inflation will crimp earnings.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average and South Korea’s Kospi
Index and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 1 percent.  Hong
Kong ’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.6 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.4 percent.  U.S. Data  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In  New York , the index fell 1.2 percent on June
24, as concern about the European debt crisis intensified and
Oracle Corp. dragged down technology shares.  Consumer spending in the U.S. probably climbed at the
slowest pace in almost a year and manufacturing cooled as dimmer
job prospects and elevated commodity costs weighed on the
recovery of the world’s biggest economy, economists said reports
this week will show.  Purchases rose 0.1 percent in May, the smallest gain since
June 2010, according to the median estimate of 63 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before a Commerce Department report
today. The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index due out
tomorrow is expected to rise to 61 in June from a six-month low
of 60.8 in May, according to the survey.  The Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to
51.8 this month from 53.5 in May, according to the survey median
before the July 1 release. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Toyota dropped 2.3 percent to 3,210 yen in Tokyo.  Sony
Corp. (6758) , the maker of the PlayStation gaming consoles and Bravia
televisions, slipped 2.1 percent to 2,033 yen. Nintendo Co., the
maker of Wii gaming consoles that gets 45 percent of its sales
from the Americas, lost 1.2 percent to 14,520 yen.  Samsung, Apple Dispute  Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s second-biggest maker
of mobile phones by sales, dropped 2 percent to 835,000 won in
Seoul. Apple Inc. sued the South Korean company charging patent
infringement, escalating the legal dispute between the rivals
over designs and technologies used in mobile devices.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 4 percent this year
through June 24, compared with a gain of 0.9 percent by the S&P
500 and a drop of 4.3 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.5 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  Asia-Pacific lenders fell after the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, a body of central bankers and regulators
that sets capital standards for banks worldwide, said in a
statement on June 25 that banks deemed too big to fail must hold
as much as 2.5 percentage points in additional capital as part
of efforts to prevent another financial crisis. As many as 30
lenders may face some level of surcharges, according to a person
familiar with the discussions.  ‘Negative Externalities’  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  slipped 1.3 percent to
A$50.45 in Sydney.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the country’s
second-largest lender by market value, lost 0.8 percent to
HK$6.44 in Hong Kong.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank
by market value, declined 1.5 percent to HK$75.20.  The steps “will help address the negative externalities
and moral hazard posed by global systemically important banks,”
Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank,
said in the banking committee statement after a meeting in Basel,
Switzerland.  Prime Minister George Papandreou faces his second survival
test in a week as lawmakers vote on a five-year austerity plan
that must pass for the cash-strapped nation to secure more
international aid. Greece needs loans from Europe and the
 International Monetary Fund  in order to cover 6.6 billion euros
($9.3 billion) of maturing bonds in August.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which operates container facilities at
Greece’s Piraeus port, fell 3.3 percent to HK$13.42 in Hong Kong.
 Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , the Hong Kong-based clothier that counts
Europe as its biggest market, slipped 4 percent to HK$23.05.
 Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese carmaker that gets about 18
percent of its sales from Europe, fell 1 percent to 204 yen.  To contact the reporters for this story:
