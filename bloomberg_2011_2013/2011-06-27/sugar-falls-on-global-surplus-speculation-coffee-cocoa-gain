Sugar declined for the second
straight session on expectations that global supplies will
exceed demand next year. Coffee and cocoa gained.  Sugar production will outpace use by 7.8 million metric
tons in the season that starts Oct. 1, the first surplus in
three years, VM Group and ABN Amro Bank NV said last week in
their first estimate for the period. The price jumped to a 30-
year high of 36.08 cents a pound in February on speculation
there would be a supply deficit.  “The market is expecting a big surplus next year,” said
Juliano Ferreira, a broker at ICAP Do  Brazil  Ctvm in  Sao Paulo .  Raw sugar for October delivery dropped 0.09 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at 25.91 cents at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in New York. The price rose in each of the past seven weeks
because of shipment delays in Brazil, the world’s biggest
producer and exporter.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery climbed 0.55
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.5105 a pound, the third straight
gain.  Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $36, or 1.2
percent, to $3,000 a ton, ending a two-session slump.  In  London , refined sugar declined, while cocoa and robusta
coffee advanced on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on the story:
