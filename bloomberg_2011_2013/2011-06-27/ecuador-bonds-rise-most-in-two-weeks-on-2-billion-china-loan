Ecuador ’s bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in two weeks, after the government signed an
accord for a $2 billion loan from  China .  The yield on Ecuador’s 9.375 percent bonds maturing in 2015
fell 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.55 percent
at 12:49 p.m. New York time. The price of the security rose 0.17
cent to 99.38 cents on the dollar, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ecuador agreed to take out a $2 billion loan from China
Development Bank Corp., two people familiar with the matter said
today. The agreement was signed in Beijing today, according to
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
terms haven’t been made public.  “Ecuadorean bonds have an extraordinary yield in an
enormously liquid market characterized by absurdly low yields,”
said Paul Palacios, the president of Albion Casa de Valores SA
Palacios, the nation’s third-largest brokerage. “This type of
loan shows investors that Ecuador is worthy of credit, at least
for the Chinese.”  Ecuador’s Finance Minister  Patricio Rivera  said June 14 the
country was seeking a $2 billion loan from China to finance
budgeted public works projects, including a hydroelectric plant
and repairs to railroads. The loan will have an interest rate of
6.9 percent and a maturity of eight years, he said at the time.  The  Finance Ministry  didn’t immediately respond to a
telephone message today seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
