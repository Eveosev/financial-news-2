President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said
French banks are headed towards an agreement to roll over 70
percent of their holdings of Greek debt between now and 2014.  “We’ve been working on this,” on the “voluntary
participation” in the roll-over, Sarkozy said at a press
conference in Paris. “If it wasn’t voluntary, it would be
viewed as a default, with huge risks of catastrophic results.”  He said he hoped other countries would follow the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
