Wolfson Microelectronics Plc (WLF)  plunged
the most in almost five years, losing more than a quarter of its
value after the U.K. semiconductor maker said second-quarter
revenue will be “towards the lower end of previous guidance”
and cut growth forecasts for 2011.  The shares slumped 26 percent in London trading, the
biggest decline since October 2006, closing down 62 pence to 175
pence, the lowest since July 30. Wolfson was the worst performer
among the 627 companies in the  FTSE All-Share Index. (ASX)   Second-quarter revenue will be between $37 million and $39
million and full-year sales will be 10 percent to 20 percent
higher than last year’s, Edinburgh-based Wolfson said in a
statement today. The median estimate of 12 analysts polled by
Bloomberg had been a 31 percent revenue increase this year.  The lowered forecast, due partly to delayed product
introductions by customers, may cut earnings per share by 54
percent, Alex Jarvis, an analyst at Peel Hunt LLP, said in a
note to clients today. Jarvis put her “buy” recommendation
under review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
