Colruyt NV,  Belgium ’s biggest
discount food retailer, reported profit that missed analyst
estimates as payroll expenses rose at a faster pace than sales
and purchasing costs weren’t fully passed on to shoppers.  Net income in the fiscal year that ended March 31 increased
2.5 percent to 338 million euros ($482.3 million) from 329.6
million euros a year earlier, the Halle, Belgium-based retailer
said today in a statement. Per-share profit of 2.14 euros missed
the 2.25 euro average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales increased 7.8 percent to 7.28 billion euros.  Colruyt expanded its workforce by 6.8 percent in the 12
months through March and payroll expenses jumped 9.5 percent as
worker pay increased in Belgium. Adverse winter weather also led
to additional expenses, Colruyt said. Delhaize Group SA’s price
cuts and Carrefour SA’s return to same-store sales growth in the
country, as well as accelerating food inflation, prevented the
discount food retailer from passing on all of its cost inflation
to consumers in the second half.  “The return of inflation and Carrefour injecting some
capex into its stores to recover its struggling business in
Belgium may put Colruyt operating margin temporarily under
pressure,” Xavier Le Mene, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG
in  London  who has a “neutral” rating on the stock, wrote in a
note to clients last week. “The competitive environment in
Belgium may be less easier for the discounter.”  Colruyt retreated 0.5 percent to 37.60 euros in Brussels
trading, extending the stock’s decline so far this year to 1.2
percent. That compares with a 9.8 percent drop for the 11-
company Bloomberg Europe Food Retailers Index in the period.  Food Inflation  Second-half sales growth at the 221 Colruyt stores, where
the food retailer generated 64 percent of full-year revenue,
accelerated to 6.5 percent from 6.3 percent in the first half as
food inflation accelerated. The retail unit’s operating margin
narrowed to 7.79 percent from 8.17 percent a year earlier and
shrunk as much as 96 basis points to 7.31 percent in the second
half, according to Bloomberg News calculations based on full-
year figures published today.  Colruyt plans to raise its gross dividend by 2.7 percent to
92 cents a share, the smallest increase since at least 1989.  The food retailer had forecast full-year net income would
rise 5 percent to 346 million euros and reiterated that guidance
as recently as November. Colruyt spent 7 million euros on stock
buybacks last year, less than 10 percent of the annual buybacks
in the past two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
