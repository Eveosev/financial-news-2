Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s biggest
lender, named Jerry Grundhofer non-executive chairman of its
U.S. subsidiary, which owns Sovereign Bank, three days after he
resigned from the board of  Citigroup Inc. (C)   The directors of Santander Holdings USA Inc. said
Grundhofer, 66, will take the job on July 1, replacing Gabriel Jaramillo, according to a statement issued today. The board will
also propose him for election as non-executive chairman of
Sovereign, the Philadelphia-based lender with $76 billion in
assets.  “In the past two years, Sovereign has experienced
significant progress and is well-positioned to continue on its
path to growth,” Santander Chairman  Emilio Botin  said in the
statement. “Jerry’s role as chairman is opportune as Sovereign
enters this new phase in its long-term plan.”  Santander, based in the Spanish city of the same name, is
trying to boost profit in the U.S., where it has grown through
acquisitions. The bank bought about $3.2 billion in auto loans
from Citigroup last June, and agreed to service $7.2 billion of
loans owned by the New York-based firm. Grundhofer was a
Citigroup director from 2009 to last week.  The Spanish lender bought Sovereign Bank in 2009 and held
intermittent talks to merge the unit with M&T Bank Corp. last
year, a person familiar with the matter said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
