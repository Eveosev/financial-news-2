South Africa ’s economy won’t grow
fast enough to reverse the jobs lost during the recession and
create new ones, President  Jacob Zuma  said.  The economy needs new ways of creating jobs, Zuma said in a
speech in Johannesburg today. The government is looking at the
 mining industry  to create more jobs and the country isn’t
reaping the full benefits of its mineral wealth, he said.  While the land reform policy hasn’t yielded “desired
results,” the issue needs “careful handling,” Zuma said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
