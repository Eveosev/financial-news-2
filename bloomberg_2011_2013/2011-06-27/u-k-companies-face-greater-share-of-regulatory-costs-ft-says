U.K. regulators may get the power to
compel public companies to hire external experts for scrutiny of
controls or governance if there are questions about those
companiesâ€™ listings or transactions, the Financial Times
reported.  Under proposals in a draft financial reform bill, that
power would be vested in the planned Financial Conduct
Authority, which is likely to supervise markets and consumer
protection after the existing Financial Services Authority is
split up in 2013, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
