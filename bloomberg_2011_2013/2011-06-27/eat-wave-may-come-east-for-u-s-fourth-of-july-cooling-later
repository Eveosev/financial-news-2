The U.S. Midwest and East may get a
heat spike in time for the Fourth of July holiday, with the main
emphasis for above-normal warmth in the South and West,
according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC.  “The main 6- to 15-day heat focus is in the South and
West,” Rogers said today in a note to clients. “We could see
stronger much-above-normal levels at times again from central
California north in the Pacific North West.”  In the 6- to 10-day forecast, Rogers said the northern
Midwest will be seasonal and in the 11- to 15-day outlook from
July 7 to July 11 it will actually become cooler than normal
with the Northeast being seasonable.  Natural-gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
whether temperatures may boost heating or cooling demand.
Predictions of below-normal or above-normal temperatures may
prompt traders to buy or sell gas futures.  Rogers said an area of disturbed weather over the Yucatan
Peninsula won’t be a major concern. The National Hurricane
Center gives the area a 20 percent chance of becoming a tropical
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
