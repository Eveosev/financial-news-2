Gigasolar Materials Corp. led solar
energy-related shares higher in Taipei trading after the company
told analysts on June 24 revenue will improve in June and July
from May, said Charlie Yeh, an analyst at President Securities
Corp.  The stock surged by the 7 percent daily limit to NT$615,
set for the biggest advance since Nov. 25.  Sino-American Silicon
Products Inc. (5483)  jumped 6.1 percent to NT$95.30.  Motech Industries
Inc. (6244)  climbed 4.4 percent to NT$108.  “The company told the analysts during their company visit
about the better revenue and this led to speculation that the
solar  energy industry  had reached a bottom,” Yeh said in a
telephone interview in Taipei. Gigasolar Chairman Chen Chi-jen
didn’t answer calls to his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
