The rand snapped three days of
losses and erased an earlier decline to the lowest level this
month against the dollar amid optimism  Greece ’s parliament will
approve budget cuts to avert a debt default.  South Africa ’s currency strengthened as much as 0.6 percent
to 6.8628 per dollar and traded 0.4 percent stronger at 6.8705
as of 5:06 p.m. in Johannesburg. It declined 0.3 percent to
9.8159 per euro.  The euro snapped a three-day slump versus the yen and
dollar as Vittorio Grilli, head of the European Union’s Economic
and Finance Committee, met representatives of some of the
world’s biggest banks to discuss how private investors can
participate in a new rescue. The rand often tracks the euro,
which accounts for 45 percent of South Africa’s exports and 34
percent of its imports.  “The intraday and intraweek focus will remain firmly on
Greece for short-term direction,” Tradition Analytics
researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in
a research note. “At the moment, the odds are still stacked in
favor of the Greek parliament being able to push through their
austerity measures.”  European Union leaders vowed to stave off a Greek default
as long as Prime Minister  George Papandreou  pushes through a 78
billion-euro ($111 billion) austerity package. European finance
chiefs will decide on July 3 whether Greece has met conditions
for its next aid payment. The first session of the Greek
parliament’s three-day debate on the austerity measures is
scheduled to begin today, with a vote expected on June 29.  Bonds gained. The 13.5 percent note due 2015 rose 25 cents
to 121.59 rand, driving the yield down seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage points, to 7.42 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
