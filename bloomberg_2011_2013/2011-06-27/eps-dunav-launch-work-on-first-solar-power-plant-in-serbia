Dunav Osiguranje AD (DNOS) ,  Serbia ’s top
insurer, and Elektroprivreda Srbija JP, the dominant power
producer, launched work on the country’s first solar plant
today.  The 5 megawatt plant is the first in a series of 50 small
plants for electricity generation from renewable sources that
the two companies plan together, Dunav said in an e-mailed
statement.  The investment at Mt. Zlativor in western Serbia is
estimated at 15 million euros ($21.3 million) and is to be
finished “in several years,” Jugoslava Smiljkovic, Dunav’s
public relations officer, said by phone today.  The partnership with the  power company , initiated in
February, represents a “new form of investment” for the
insurer, Dunav said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
