Russia’s two largest oil export
facilities will increase combined daily shipments of Urals crude
in July by 1 percent from this month, according to a preliminary
loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 56 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each will be
exported from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  in July. That’s
equivalent to 1.32 million barrels a day, down 6.6 percent from
this month. Urals exports in July from Novorossiysk on the  Black
Sea  will be 35 shipments totaling 3.795 million tons, or 897,334
barrels a day, 15 percent more than in June.  The world’s largest oil producer will also export four
cargoes totaling 290,000 tons of Siberian Light crude from
Tuapse on the Black Sea. That’s equivalent to 68,571 barrels a
day, 38 percent less than this month, the plan showed.  The final loading program will be released later this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
