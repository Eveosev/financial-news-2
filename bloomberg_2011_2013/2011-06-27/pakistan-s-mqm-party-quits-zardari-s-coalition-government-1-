Muttahida Qaumi Movement, which was
part of Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari’s government, said
it quit the coalition because of differences with the ruling
 Pakistan People’s Party.   “We tried the politics of reconciliation, but now we have
developed differences over policies,” Farooq Sattar, deputy
convener of the  MQM , said today at a news conference in Karachi.  Prime Minister  Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani , who convinced the
Muttahida Qaumi Movement to return to the coalition once in
January, may not repeat the move after teaming up with former
opposition party  The Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid)  on May 2.
The party, led by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, joined the coalition
for the remaining two years of the government, Farhatullah Babar,
a spokesman for the president, said that day.  Zardari’s party has 125 members in the 342-member National
Assembly, while Muttahida has 25 members and the League has 52
members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
