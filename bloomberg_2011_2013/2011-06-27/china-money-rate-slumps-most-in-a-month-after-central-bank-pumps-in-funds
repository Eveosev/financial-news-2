China ’s money-market rate fell the
most in more than a month on speculation central bank injections
of capital will help ease a cash shortage.  The People’s Bank of China added a net 87 billion yuan
($13.4 billion) of funds last week and has pumped in 467 billion
yuan in the past six weeks. A total of 142 billion yuan of
central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  will mature this
week, compared with 88 billion yuan last week, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in Shanghai.  “There will be an easing of the cash shortage this week,
especially in the latter part of the week, as the central bank
injects such a big amount of capital,” said Shi Lei, head of
fixed-income research in Beijing at Ping An Securities Co., a
unit of the nation’s second-largest insurance company.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 117 basis points to 7.25 percent
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , the biggest decline since
May 18, according to a weighted average rate compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center.  China’s inflation won’t exceed 6 percent in any single
month as the pace of price increases stabilizes and slows in the
second half of the year,  Fan Gang , a former academic adviser to
the People’s Bank of China, said yesterday.  Consumer prices climbed 5.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most since July 2008, the statistics bureau said on
June 14. China will find it difficult to meet its official
inflation target of 4 percent this year, Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said, according to a Radio Television Hong Kong report today.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, slid eight basis
points to 3.77 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 3.74 percent, the lowest level since June 15.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2021 dropped four basis points to 3.83 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  -- Judy Chen . Editor: Sandy Hendry  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
