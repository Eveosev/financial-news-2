John Calipari, who coached the
 University of Kentucky  men’s basketball team to the semifinals
of last year’s  National Collegiate Athletic Association 
postseason tournament, received a contract extension through the
2018-2019 season that will pay him at least $36.5 million.  The agreement pays him $400,000 in base salary and $3.4
million for media and endorsements next season. If the Wildcats
win the national championship and show their athletes are on
schedule to graduate, Calipari could earn as much as $4.65
million, according to his contract.  “What John Calipari has done on and off the court in the
past two years to reunite and rejuvenate this fan base has been
magical,” Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart said in a statement.  Calipari, 52, earns a $1 million retention bonus in 2012-
2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015, 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and $1.1
million in 2018-2019.  His previous contract expired after the 2017 season.  He receives an incentive bonus of $100,000 if  Kentucky  is
one of the final 16 teams in the men’s basketball tournament,
another $100,000 if they are among the final eight, an
additional $150,000 if they are one of the final four, plus
$350,000 if they win the NCAA tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
