MetLife Inc. (MET)  is in advanced
discussions for a naming-rights sponsorship at New Meadowlands
Stadium, home of the  National Football League ’s New York Giants
and Jets, SportsBusiness Journal reported.  The naming-rights package being negotiated would average
between $17 million and $18 million a year, SportsBusiness
Journal said, citing a person close to the talks it didn’t
identify.  MetLife is one of four cornerstone sponsors of the $1.6
billion stadium that opened last year, paying about $7 million
annually for in-stadium branding.  Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the New Meadowlands
Stadium, declined to comment. MetLife spokesman Christopher Breslin said in an e-mail that the company doesn’t comment on
rumor or speculation.  MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, is a sponsor of the
U.S. PGA Tour and the company’s branded blimps appear at golf
tournaments and other sporting events. The New Meadowlands
Stadium will host the  Super Bowl  in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
