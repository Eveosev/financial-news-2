Kuwait Energy Co., a privately owned
oil and natural-gas company operating in the  Middle East  and the
former  Soviet Union , said its 2010 net income rose almost four-
fold to $21.9 million.  The results benefitted from “a continued increase in
production, proceeds from partial divestments, and higher oil
and gas prices,” Chairman Manssour Aboukhamseen said in an e-
mailed statement today. Kuwait Energy earned net income of $5.6
million in the previous year.  The company generated sales of $141.8 million, up 61
percent from 2009, the statement said. Daily average production
increased 15 percent from the previous year to 13,258 barrels of
oil equivalent a day. Shareholders approved the board’s
recommendation to distribute a dividend of 5 fils (18 cents) per
share, it said.  Kuwait Energy is active in Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Oman,
Ukraine, Latvia, Russia and  Pakistan . The company had proven and
probable reserves of 48.8 million barrels of oil equivalent at
the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
