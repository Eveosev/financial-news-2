An Eric Clapton guitar, a Margaret Thatcher handbag and an Andy Warhol drawing of the late Princess of  Wales  sold tonight in a charity auction by author Jeffrey Archer that raised about 402,100 pounds ($643,000).  The top lot in the Christie’s International London event
was an Omega stopwatch used by a timekeeper in May 1954 when
Roger Bannister became the first person to run a mile in less
than four minutes. It sold for 97,250 pounds.  The Asprey black leather bag was used by Thatcher, the
U.K.’s former Prime Minister, when visiting U.S. President
 Ronald Reagan  at Camp David in 1985. It had been owned by the
“Iron Lady” for more than 30 years. Her trademark fashion
accessory was donated to the sale with an estimate of 75,000
pounds to 100,000 pounds. It fetched 25,000 pounds, and was
bought by a private collector from Cyprus, bidding by telephone.  Archer, 70, the writer of novels such as “Not a Penny More,
Not a Penny Less,” was on the rostrum for the sale of 18 items,
wielding a diamond-encrusted gavel donated by the jeweler
 Laurence Graff .  The Warhol work fetched 79,250 pounds.  Clapton gave a signed Fender Telecaster guitar which sold
for 15,000 pounds against an estimate of 20,000 pounds to 30,000
pounds.  Bernie Ecclestone , President and CEO of Formula One
Management, donated two VIP passes to next year’s Monaco Grand
Prix. They fetched 34,850 pounds, against an estimate of 75,000
pounds to 100,000 pounds.  Oxford, Cambridge  All proceeds from the auction will benefit a range of
charities that include Oxfam, the British Red Cross and
Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, chaired by
the author’s wife Mary Archer. The watch’s proceeds are being
donated to the Oxford University Athletics Club.  Tomorrow, Christie’s South Kensington will host an auction
of 150 works of art from Archer’s personal collection, as well
as pieces from the recently closed  Neffe Degandt Gallery ,
Mayfair, with whom the author had a business partnership, said
Christie’s.  Highlights of the auction will include the 1878 Claude Monet painting, “La Seine pres de Vetheuil, temps orageux,”
which has a revised estimate of 1.2 million pounds to 1.7 
million pounds, and a Warhol “Marilyn” silkscreen at 100,000
pounds to 150,000 pounds.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
