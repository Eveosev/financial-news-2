Wide receiver  Terrell Owens  had knee
surgery following an offseason injury and is likely to be out
until at least mid-to-late November, ESPN.com reported.  Owens, the five-time All-Pro who is a free agent after
playing last season for the Cincinnati Bengals, had the
procedure within the past month after tearing his anterior
cruciate ligament, the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  website  reported , citing
people familiar with the injury that it didn’t identify.  Owens, 37, was hurt while taping a television show for VH1,
one source told ESPN, while another said the injury occurred
during a personal workout. The network didn’t specify which
knee.  A telephone message left at the office of Owens’s agent,
Drew Rosenhaus, wasn’t immediately returned. Rosenhaus was
unavailable to comment to ESPN last night and people close to
the receiver ignored specific inquiries, ESPN said.  Owens had 72 catches for 983 yards and nine touchdowns last
season, which ended for him after tearing cartilage in his left
knee on Dec. 19.  He’s second in National Football League history to Jerry Rice with 15,934 career receiving yards, and has 153 touchdown
catches, trailing only Rice and tying him with  Randy Moss .  To contact the reporter on this story:
