Cross shareholdings between Japanese
companies fell to a record low at the end of March, according to
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Stocks held by corporate allies fell to 11.1 percent of
total outstanding shares as of March 31, a 0.4 percentage point
decline from a year earlier, the brokerage said in a report
today, based on a survey of 3,631 companies. Cross shareholdings,
which have declined two years running, fell to the lowest level
since Nomura started tracking the figure in 1991.  Companies are trimming their holdings after the
 International Accounting Standards Board  issued guidance in
December 2009 that the current market value of shareholdings
must be included in financial statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
