Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  won a
recommendation by an Idaho Department of Transportation official
to use the state’s Highway 12 to transport heavy equipment
destined for the company’s Kearl oil-sands project.  A hearing officer recommended the state issue permits to
haul the equipment from the port of Lewiston to the Montana
border, the department said in an e-mailed statement today.  The hearing officer found no errors were made in granting
the initial permit to haul the equipment through the state,
according to the statement. The recommendation can be appealed
to the hearing officer within 14 days and then appealed to the
head of the department.  The shipment has been held up since April when opposition
groups filed petitions with officials in Idaho and  Montana .
Imperial Oil, the Canadian division of Exxon, purchased about
200 modules to be used in the construction of a new bitumen
mining and refinery plant at its Kearl oil-sands project in
northern Alberta.  The first 33 modules, each of which is as tall as 30 feet
(9 meters) and 100 feet long, arrived from  Asia  at the port of
Vancouver,  Washington , in October, where they were to begin the
final leg of their journey along Highway 12 through Idaho and
Montana to Alberta.  Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, is still awaiting a decision
by a Montana judge to use that state’s portion of the road,
which travels through the Bitterroot Mountains and into  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
