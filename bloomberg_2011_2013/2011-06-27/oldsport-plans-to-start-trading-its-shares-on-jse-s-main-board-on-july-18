Holdsport Ltd., a South African
company that runs the  Sportsmans Warehouse  and Outdoor Warehouse
retail chains, plans to raise as much as 1.2 billion rand ($173
million) selling shares to selected investors.  The company will offer up to 30 million shares during a
book-build process at between 31 rand and 39 rand apiece before
its listing on the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange  on July 18,
Holdsport said in a statement today. The final offer price will
be determined after the book-build process, it said.  A total of 42.9 million shares will be listed on the
apparel retail division of the stock market’s main board, it
said.  Holdsport operates 51 stores in  South Africa  and one in
 Namibia . The listing aims to facilitate the exit of the
company’s 67 percent shareholder, private equity firm Ethos
Private Equity Ltd., Holdsport Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hodgson said in an interview on June 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
