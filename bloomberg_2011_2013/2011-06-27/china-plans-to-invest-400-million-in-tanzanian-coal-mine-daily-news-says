China  will invest $400 million in

megawatts of electricity, the Daily News reported, citing Energy
and Mines minister William Ngeleja.  The money comes under a soft loan arrangement, the Dar es
Salaam-based newspaper reported. Five groups, including the
state-run  National Social Security Fund , applied to run the
project, before the government accepted China’s offer, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
