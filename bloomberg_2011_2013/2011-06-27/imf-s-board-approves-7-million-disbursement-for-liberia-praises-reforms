The  International Monetary Fund 
completed a review of Liberia’s economic performance under the
extended credit facility, which will enable a disbursement
equivalent to about $7 million to the African nation.  The IMF’s board also approved authorities’ request for an
extension of the arrangement through March 31, 2012, and an
increase in funds for access by about $13 million.  “The Liberian authorities continue to implement sound
macroeconomic policies and are making progress with their broad-
based reform program,’’ the fund said in an e-mailed statement.
“Growth is expected to pick up in 2011, bolstered by increasing
foreign investment, the reserve position is comfortable, and
inflation is projected to remain broadly stable despite rising
commodity prices.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
