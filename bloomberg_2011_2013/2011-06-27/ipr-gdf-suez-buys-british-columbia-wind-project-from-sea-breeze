IPR- GDF Suez (GSZ)  North America, a
partnership between Britain’s  International Power Plc (IPR)  and
France’s GDF Suez, bought a 99-megawatt wind farm in Canada from
 Sea Breeze Power Corp. (SBX)   IPR-GDF Suez North America will pay C$12 million ($12.2
million) for the Knob Hill project, which it renamed Cape Scott
Wind Farm, Vancouver-based Sea Breeze said today in a statement.  Sea Breeze received an initial payment of C$1.9 million and
will receive the balance through similar payments by the time
the wind farm goes into operation in British Columbia. It will
also receive a percentage of the revenue from Cape Scott’s 20-
year power-sales contract with British Columbia Hydro & Power
Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
