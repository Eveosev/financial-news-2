China ’s stocks rose for a fifth day,
the longest winning streak since February, after a cash shortage
in the financial system eased and the nation’s biggest
brokerages said equities were poised to rally.  China Eastern  Airlines Corp. climbed to the highest in two
weeks after the government said it will cut import tariffs on
jet fuel. Tangshan Jidong Cement Co. led gains for cement
producers as Citic Securities Co. and China International
Capital Corp. recommended the industry on the outlook for
economic growth. Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. rose 2.2 percent after
a former central bank governor said inflation will slow.  “The domestic economy is in a good shape and a hard
landing is unlikely,” said Wei Wei, an analyst at West China
Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Stocks are pretty cheap.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, gained 12.02 points, or 0.4 percent, to
2,758.23 at the 3 p.m. close. It climbed 3.9 percent last week,
the most since the five days ended Nov. 5, after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said efforts to stem inflation have worked. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.3 percent to 3,036.49, compared with a 0.6 percent
drop for a gauge of emerging-market stocks.  The Shanghai gauge has slumped 9.8 percent from this year’s
high on April 18 on concern that government measures to cool
inflation will slow economic growth. The central bank has raised
 reserve requirements  12 times and  interest rates  four times
since the start of last year. The  stock index  has lost 1.8
percent this year, dragging down average estimated price
earnings to 12.8 times from 15.9 times at the end of 2010.  The lowest Chinese stock valuations since economic growth
collapsed three years ago are a sign to the nation’s biggest
brokerages that it’s time to buy.  Cheap Valuations  Citic and CICC, which predicted the drop this quarter, say
the market will rally in the second half as inflation peaks and
the government sustains economic expansion by easing credit.
EvenNouriel Roubini, the New York University economist who says
China may face a “hard landing” after 2013, expects growth of
at least 8.8 percent in 2011 and 2012.  “A slowdown has been fully priced-in,” said Hao Hong,
CICC’s global equity strategist. “Depressed valuation,
sentiment and technical indicators all augur well for a budding
tradable rally.”  CICC said “highly cyclical” industries such as cement,
mining, machinery, property, insurance, brokers, industrials and
consumer discretionary are likely to rally the most.  Tangshan Jidong Cement advanced 1.6 percent to 24.95 yuan.
Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-biggest coal miner, rose 2.2
percent to 34.91 yuan. Shanxi Lu’an Environmental Energy
Development Co. gained 4.9 percent to 65.98 yuan. Datong Coal
Industry Co., China’s third-largest coal company by capacity,
added 0.3 percent to 16.86 yuan.  Inflation Outlook  Premier Wen said China can keep full-year inflation within
5 percent as tightening measures take effect. The inflation rate
was 5.5 percent last month, the highest level since July 2008.  “I see difficulties in reaching the full-year inflation
target of 4 percent,” Wen said in comments broadcast today by
Hong Kong-based Cable TV. “But it still can be kept below 5
percent after the efforts we have made.” He spoke at a Chinese
community event in  London , the broadcaster said.  China’s seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 114 basis points to 7.27 percent
as of 3:29 p.m. in Shanghai, the biggest decline since May 18,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  Airlines Gain  The People’s Bank of China added a net 87 billion yuan
($13.4 billion) of funds last week and has pumped in 467 billion
yuan in the past six weeks. A total of 142 billion yuan of
central bank bills and  repurchase agreements  will mature this
week, compared with 88 billion yuan last week, according to Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co.  China Eastern, the second-largest, gained 0.6 percent to
5.24 yuan. Hainan Airlines Co. climbed 1.1 percent to 7.20 yuan.  Tariffs on gasoline and  fuel oil  will be lowered to 1
percent, the ministry said in a statement on June 24. The
current import tax on  jet fuel  is 6 percent, and 3 percent for
fuel oil.  Net income for Chinese industrial companies rose 27.9
percent in the first five months from a year earlier to 1.92
trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said on its
website today. That compares with a 29.7 percent gain for
January through April.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., the listed unit of China’s
second-biggest steelmaker, lost 0.2 percent to 6.06 yuan. SAIC
Motor Corp., China’s largest carmaker, fell 0.4 percent to 18.89
yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
