Namakwa Diamonds Ltd. (NAD)  said a mining
contractor with whom it previously held talks on a potential

proceedings against the company and the government of  Lesotho .   Any claim would be “without merit,” Namakwa said, adding
that it intends to contest any claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
