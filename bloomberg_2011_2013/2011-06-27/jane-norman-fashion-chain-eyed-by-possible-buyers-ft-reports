Edinburgh Woollen Mill Ltd.,
 Debenhams Plc (DEB)  and Aurora Fashions Holdings Ltd. are all
interested in buying all or part of Jane Norman Holdings Ltd., a
U.K. womenâ€™s fashion chain, the Financial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Jane Norman may, however, be put into a so-called pre-pack
administration, in which an agreement is reached with secured
creditors and an administrator is appointed for a few hours to
carry out the sale of the business to a new company, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
