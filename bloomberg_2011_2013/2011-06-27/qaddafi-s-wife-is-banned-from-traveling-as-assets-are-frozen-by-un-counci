Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
wife, the country’s minister of planning and finance and the
Zueitina Oil Company have been added to the list of persons and
entities subject to the  United Nations  travel ban and asset
freeze.  It’s the first tightening of sanctions against the regime
in three months. The U.S., Britain, France and  Germany  proposed
in April to impose sanctions on 24 persons and 30 companies
alleged to have financed or otherwise supported attacks on anti-
government protesters. Unanimous approval of all 15 members of
the UN  Security Council  is required for such action, and  Russia 
didn’t give its consent to any of the designations until June
24.  The list now includes Qaddafi’s wife, Safia Farkash al-
Barassi, and Minister for Planning and Finance Abdelhazi Zlitni.
The Zueitina Oil Company is described as “owned or controlled
by Libyan National Oil Corporation,” which was sanctioned on
March 17.  Still pending are proposed sanctions on Prime Minister
Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and other top government officials, the
Libyan Jamahirya Broadcasting Corp., the  National Commercial
Bank  and the Sirte, Ras Lanuf, Waha and Brega oil companies.
China and Russia have blocked the necessary accord to add them
to the sanctions list.  Qaddafi, his seven sons, his daughter, two cousins and 11
other government officials were previously hit with a travel ban
and asset freeze, and the assets of the  Central Bank  of Libya
were frozen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
