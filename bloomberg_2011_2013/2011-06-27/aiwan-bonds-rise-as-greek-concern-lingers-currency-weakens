Taiwan ’s government bonds rose, with
10-year yields dropping the most since June 16, as investors
favored the safest debt on concern an austerity plan by Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  will fail.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares slid as
Greece lawmakers vote on the five-year plan that must pass for
the cash-strapped nation to secure more international aid. The
 Taiwan dollar , which was trading 0.1 percent stronger versus its
U.S. counterpart three minutes before the end of local trading,
closed 0.2 percent weaker.  “The sell-off in Taiwan stocks has benefited bonds
today,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at
Polaris Securities Co.  The yield on the 1.375 percent bonds due March 2021, the
most-traded  government securities , fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.48 percent as of the 1:30 p.m. close
in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The Taiwan dollar dropped to NT$29.010 against its U.S.
counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. The currency touched NT$29.020, the weakest level since May
24.  Taiwan’s central bank, which raised the benchmark interest
rate by 12.5 basis points to 1.75 percent in March, will boost
the rate to 1.875 percent, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Investors are pretty much expecting a 12.5-basis point
increase in  interest rates  again,” said Leung. “The
expectations have already been priced in.”  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was steady at 0.34 percent, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
