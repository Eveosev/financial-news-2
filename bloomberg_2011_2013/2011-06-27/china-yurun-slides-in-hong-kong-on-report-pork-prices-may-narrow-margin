China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068) , a
Chinese supplier of meat products, said its gross profit margin
had a “slight decrease” in the first five months of this year,
following a record plunge in its stock after a website report.  Yurun slid by HK$5.10, or 20 percent, to HK$20.60 at the 4
p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong today. The drop was the
biggest since the company first sold shares in October 2005 and
the steepest decline today on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Rising pork prices will erode the profit margin of Nanjing,
Jiangsu province-based Yurun, the Chinese-language financial
website JRJ.com reported earlier today, without saying how it
got the information.  The company’s sales had “significant growth” in the
period up to May 31 compared with 2010 on higher hog prices and
greater slaughtering volume, Yurun said in a statement to the
 Hong Kong  Stock Exchange, citing unaudited financial
information.  The price of marbled pork in  China  rose as much as 4.3
percent to 28.20 yuan ($4.35) a kilogram in the 10 days from
June 11 to June 20 compared with the previous 10 days, the
National Bureau of Statistics said in a June 24 statement on its
website. Prices for pork thigh rose 4.1 percent to 29.05 yuan a
kilogram in the period, the statement said.  Short-selling volume for Yurun shares reached a record on
June 24, when the stock fell 5 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  --Michael Wei. Editors:  Paul Gordon , Ryan Woo  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
