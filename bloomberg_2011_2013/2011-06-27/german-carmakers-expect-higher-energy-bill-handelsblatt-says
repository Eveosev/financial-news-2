Germany ’s automotive industry will
have additional annual costs of about 160 million euros ($228
million) related to higher electricity prices because of the
country’s exit from nuclear energy,  Handelsblatt  reported,
citing Matthias Wissmann, who heads the VDA, the German
carmakers’ association.  Car prices may rise because of the higher energy costs, the
newspaper said in a preview of a report to be published
