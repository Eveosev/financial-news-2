Ferrostaal AG may pay 177 million
euros ($250 million) to settle allegations that managers paid
bribes to get a 1.6 billion-euro order for submarines in 2000,
 Der Spiegel  reported, citing negotiations between court
officials, prosecutors and defendants.  Under an agreement that hasn’t yet been completed, two
former managers would get two-year suspended sentences and be
ordered to pay fines, the magazine said.  Maria Lahaye-Geusen, a Ferrostaal spokeswoman, declined to
comment; Barbara Stockinger, a spokeswoman for Munich
prosecutors, wasn’t immediately available to comment.  Munich prosecutors said in April that a former member of
Ferrostaal’s management board and a former manager were charged
with paying bribes totaling more than 62 million euros between
2000 and 2007 to win submarine orders from Greece and Portugal.  Ferrostaal, based in Essen,  Germany , has been under
investigation since 2009. In April, the prosecutors said talks
with the company to settle the matter had failed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
