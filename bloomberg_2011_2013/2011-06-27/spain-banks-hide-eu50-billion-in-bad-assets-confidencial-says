Spanish banks have 50 billion euros
($70.7 billion) in unrecognised problematic real estate assets,
 El Confidencial  reported, citing a report by the  Boston
Consulting Group .  The consulting group estimates that Spanish banks need
between 20 billion euros and 30 billion euros in additional
capital and that  Spain â€™s bank rescue fund, known as the FROB,
could end up taking over 20 percent of the banking industry, El
Confidencial added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
