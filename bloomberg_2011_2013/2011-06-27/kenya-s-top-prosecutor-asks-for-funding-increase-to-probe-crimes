Kenya ’s office of public
prosecutions needs increased funding to hire lawyers and offer
its staff better salaries and benefits, its new chief said.  There is “a case to be made for the government to improve
substantially the budgetary allocation for the directorate,”
State Prosecutor Keriako Tobiko said today in the capital,
Nairobi, at a training program for 32 newly recruited
prosecutors.  Tobiko was sworn in on June 20 as the country’s first
director of public prosecutions, a position created under a
constitution enacted last year as part of wider changes that
aimed to avoid a repeat of post-election violence in 2008. While
the public prosecution office’s funding will almost double to
355 million shillings ($4 million) in the financial year through
June 30, 2012, it receives about a fourth of the  Kenya Anti-
Corruption Commission’s  budget, Tobiko said.  Two months of fighting sparked by a disputed election ended
after President Mwai Kibaki signed a power-sharing accord with
then-opposition leader  Raila Odinga , who was named prime
minister. The accord committed the leaders to changing the
police and judiciary and settling land disputes.  Kenya had a backlog of 688,760 court cases at the end of
last year, down 18 percent from a year earlier, the  Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics  said in a May report.  The appointment of Tobiko, along with Chief Justice Willy Mutunga and his deputy, Nancy Baraza, marks a turning point in
the reform of Kenya’s legal system, which has been marred by
unethical behavior and weak administration, Kibaki said on June
20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
