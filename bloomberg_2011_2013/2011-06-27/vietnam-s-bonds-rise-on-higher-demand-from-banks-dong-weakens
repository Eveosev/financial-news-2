Vietnam ’s government bonds advanced
on speculation demand has been bolstered because of an increase
in the amount of cash available at banks. The dong weakened.  Lenders are recalling loans to meet a central bank-imposed
lending cap ahead of a June 30 deadline, Phap Luat  Ho Chi Minh
City  newspaper reported on its website, citing Le Hoang Chau,
chairman of Ho Chi Minh City’s property association.  “Banks’ appetite for bonds has risen” due to the
availability of funds increasing recently, said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Anh, the Ho Chi Minh City-based head of fixed-income trading at
Asia Commercial Bank. “Recent drops in  interest rates  in the
interbank market reflect the funding improvement,” she said.  The yield on the benchmark five-year notes fell six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 12.54 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The overnight interbank deposit rate fell 12 basis points
to 12.44 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Lending rates in the  interbank market  have been falling with
overnight rates at 13 percent and one-week rates at 15 percent,
the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a statement on its website on
June 23.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,596 per dollar as of
4:41 p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate at
20,618 today, unchanged from June 13, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. With reporting by Diep Pham. Editors:
