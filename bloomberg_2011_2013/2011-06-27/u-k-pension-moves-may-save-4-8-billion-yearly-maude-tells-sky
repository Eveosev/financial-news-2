U.K. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude told Sky News in an interview that the government’s
proposals on public pensions would save 3 billion pounds ($4.8
billion) a year.  It would be “premature” for public sector workers to go
on strike over the changes because “talks are still going on
and making progress,” he told Sky News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
