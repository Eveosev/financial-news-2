Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell
North Sea Forties crude. No bids or offers were made for Russian
Urals in northwest  Europe  and the Mediterranean.  Russia’s two largest oil-export facilities will increase
combined daily shipments of Urals crude in July by 1 percent
from this month, according to a preliminary loading schedule
obtained by Bloomberg News.  North Sea  Trafigura sought to sell one cargo of Forties for loading
July 9 to July 11 at 40 cents a barrel below Dated Brent or
another for July 13 to July 15 at 30 cents less than the
benchmark, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. The company sold one
shipment at a discount of 30 cents on June 24.  Statoil ASA was unable to sell a consignment of Forties for
July 11 to July 13 at 25 cents below Dated Brent, the survey
showed.  Reported  North Sea  market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was 28 cents below
Dated Brent, compared with a discount of 1 cent June 24,
according to Bloomberg data.  Brent for August settlement traded at $104.97 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, down from $105.34 June 24. The September contract was at
$104.94, 3 cents less than August.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol didn’t manage on June 27 to sell 140,000 metric tons
of Urals for July 4 to July 8 delivery in the Mediterranean at
$2 a barrel below Dated Brent.  A total of 56 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each of Urals
will be exported from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  in July. That’s
equivalent to 1.32 million barrels a day, down 6.6 percent from
this month. Urals exports in July from Novorossiysk on the  Black
Sea  will be 35 shipments totaling 3.795 million tons, or 897,334
barrels a day, 15 percent more than in June.  The world’s largest oil producer will also export four
cargoes totaling 290,000 tons of Siberian Light crude from
Tuapse on the Black Sea. That’s equivalent to 68,571 barrels a
day, 38 percent less than this month, the plan showed.  West Africa  Angola  will reduce daily crude exports by 4.7 percent in
August from a month earlier, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africa’s second-largest oil producer plans to ship 50
million barrels, or 1.61 million barrels a day, in August,
compared with 52.5 million, or 1.69 million barrels a day in
July, the program showed. The number of shipments planned will
total 52 in August versus 55 a month earlier.  The country will ship nine cargoes of Dalia crude in August,
one more than the provisional schedule, while exports for other
grades are unchanged from originally planned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
