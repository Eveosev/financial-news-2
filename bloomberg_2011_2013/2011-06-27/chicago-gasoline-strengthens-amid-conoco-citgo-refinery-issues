Chicago  gasoline strengthened after
ConocoPhillips’s Wood River, Illinois, plant experienced a power
outage and Exxon Mobil Corp. shut a furnace at its refinery in
Joliet.  Conoco’s 380,900-barrel-a-day plant will operate at reduced
rates for several days while units are restarted after the June
25 power disruption,  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 6.25 cents to 7.25 versus futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:51 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 0.21 cent to
$2.6395 a gallon.  Exxon’s 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet plant released
emissions late yesterday when the incinerator unit failed, Exxon
said in a filing with the  Illinois  Emergency Management Agency.  The same fuel in the Midwest, or Group 3, strengthened 0.88
cent to narrow its discount to 12.38 cents a gallon.  Coffeyville Resources LLC had a release of gases at its
Coffeyville refinery in Kansas after a gas compressor shut down,
according to a report with the National Response Center.  Steve Eames, a Coffeyville spokesman, declined to comment.  The 120,000-barrel-a-day plant released gases from a coker
flare, according to the filing.  Regular gasoline in the Gulf Coast narrowed its discount to
futures 1.8 cents to 12 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
