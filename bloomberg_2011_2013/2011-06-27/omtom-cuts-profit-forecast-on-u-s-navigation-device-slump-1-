TomTom NV (TOM2) ,  Europe ’s largest maker of
portable navigation devices, slashed its full-year profit and
sales forecasts as U.S. demand for its devices declined faster
than anticipated.  Earnings per share will be in a range of 25 euro cents to
30 cents in 2011, TomTom said in a statement today. In April,
the company predicted “broadly flat” earnings per share
compared with 49 cents in 2010. Full-year sales will be 1.23
billion euros ($1.7 billion) to 1.28 billion euros, about 14
percent less than an earlier range and a second cut this year.  “Consumer electronics markets have been weak over recent
weeks and this trend is ongoing,” Amsterdam-based TomTom said
today. The North American portable navigation-device market “is
experiencing a faster rate of decline than earlier in the year
and we now expect this market to be down by about 30 percent.”  Rival  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  slumped as much as 6.7 percent and was
down 4.9 percent to $31.81 at 12:39 p.m. in  New York . TomTom
added 0.1 percent to 4.89 euros at the close of trading in
Amsterdam before the statement. The stock has lost 38 percent
this year, cutting its market value to 1.1 billion euros.  “More consumers are opting for entry level products than
expected and lower levels of inventory are being held in the
channel,” TomTom said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
