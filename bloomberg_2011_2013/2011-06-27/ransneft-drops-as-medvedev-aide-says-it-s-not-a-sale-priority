OAO Transneft dropped for a fourth
day after Arkady Dvorkovich, economic aide to President  Dmitry
Medvedev , said Russia’s oil pipeline operator is “not a
priority” for state asset sales.  The stock retreated 2 percent to 40,126 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow.  Transneft shareholders representing 21 percent of the
company’s preferred shares, including Prosperity Capital and
East Capital, wrote to Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in
August last year asking him to sell 25 percent of the company’s
common stock.  “Transneft is only held by speculative punters these days
and they are clinging on to fading hopes that privatization may
bring about a much-needed change in approach, one that might
prioritize minority shareholders,” Julian Rimmer, a trader of
Russian shares at CF Global Trading in  London , said in e-mailed
comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
