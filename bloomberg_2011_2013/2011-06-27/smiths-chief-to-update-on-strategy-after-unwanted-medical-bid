Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  Chief Executive
Officer Philip Bowman will update investors this week on his
strategy for the British maker of scanners, including plans for
a medical-equipment unit that’s been the focus of a takeover
offer.  Presentations to investors by Bowman and executives from
the company’s five main divisions will also touch on the outlook
for operational improvements and growth, Colin McSeveny, a
spokesman for the London-based company, said by e-mail.  Smiths is meeting investors on June 28 in  New York  in a bid
to raise its profile in the U.S., where it does about 55 percent
of its business. Investors are looking for indications on how
the company will fare after flagging sales of scanners and
medical gear in the first 10 months of its fiscal year held back
growth driven by demand for mechanical seals.  “The better we get the businesses to perform the more
valuable they are in the event that portfolio change happens,”
said  Sandy Morris , an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc.  Bowman turned down a $3.89 billion offer for the medical-
equipment unit in January, saying it failed to value the
business properly. His appointment in 2007 fanned speculation
about a possible breakup. Bowman had negotiated the sales of
Scottish Power Plc and Allied Domecq when he was CEO of those
companies.  Smiths, founded in 1851 as a watch shop, already sold an
aerospace division to General Electric Co. for $4.8 billion in
2007. That left the U.K. company focused on X-ray machines and
scanners for airports and hospitals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
