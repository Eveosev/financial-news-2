Tax increases are “politically
impossible” and can’t be part of any debt-cutting agreement
between congressional Republicans and President  Barack Obama ,
said Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell .  “We have seen the consequences of giving Washington a
blank check,” McConnell said today on the Senate floor. “My
message to the president is simple: It’s time for Washington to
focus on fixing itself. It’s time Washington take the hit, not
the taxpayers.”  The Kentucky Republican plans to meet with Obama at the
White House later today in an effort to revive deficit-reduction
talks that stalled over differences on tax increases and cuts to
entitlement programs such as Medicare. McConnell said he will
ask Obama to drop any push for revenue increases.  Leaders in both political parties are seeking a way to cut
at least $1 trillion from the long-term deficit and raise the
nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling before an Aug. 2 deadline.  Obama met this morning with Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid . Both agreed any final package must be “balanced” by
including tax increases along with cuts to federal programs,
said White House spokesman Jay Carney.  Moody’s Investors Service this month said it will put the
U.S. government’s Aaa  credit rating  under review for a downgrade
unless there’s progress on increasing the limit by mid-July.
 Standard & Poor’s  in April put the U.S. on notice that it risks
losing its top credit rating unless policy makers agree on a
plan by 2013 to reduce budget deficits and the national debt.  To contact the reporters on this story:
