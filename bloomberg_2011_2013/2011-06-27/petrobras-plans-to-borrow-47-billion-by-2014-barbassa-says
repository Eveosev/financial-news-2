Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, said it’s seeking to borrow about
$47 billion by 2014 as it develops the Americas’ largest crude
discovery in three decades.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based company is known,
will need to raise about $17 billion of net debt and plans to
refinance about $29 billion of existing debt in that time, Chief
Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said today in  Sao Paulo . The
company, which has ruled out additional dollar-denominated bond
sales this year after a $6 billion issue in January, may sell
debt in pounds or other foreign currencies, he said.  “For dollar debt, the issue we had to do we did in
January,” Barbassa said. “So we won’t be going back to the
market for dollars. But we are analyzing other currencies.”  Petrobras is currently revising its five-year, $224 billion
investment plan, which is updated annually, as it develops  oil
fields  in Brazil’s offshore pre-salt region. The company’s Lula
field was the biggest crude find in the Americas since  Mexico ’s
Cantarell in 1976.  The yield on Petrobras’s bonds due in 2019 rose 4 basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.71 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Petrobras rose 21 centavos, or 0.9 percent, to close at
23.08 reais in Sao Paulo trading. The stock has lost 17 percent
in the past year, more than the 5.6 percent drop for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
