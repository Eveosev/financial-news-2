Zimbabwe  plans to introduce new
diamond mining and trading laws aimed at making the industry
more transparent, the  Daily News  reported, citing Deputy Mines
Minister Gift Chimanikire.  The so-called Diamond Act will create a commissioner who
will ensure Zimbabweâ€™s diamond mines and exports meet all
international standards, the Harare-based newspaper said. The
law will also specify the role of state security at gem mines,
the Daily News cited Chimanikire as saying.  While the law will give the state exclusive rights to mine
diamonds in Zimbabwe, joint-ventures will be allowed, the
newspaper said. In 2008, more than 200 people were killed when
security forces took over the Marange diamond fields in
Zimbabwe, according to a report by  Human Rights Watch .  To contact the reporter on this story:
