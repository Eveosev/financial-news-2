Two people were injured in a blast
outside in Maiduguri,  Nigeria , in a third day of violence in the
northeastern city, said Major-General Jack Nwaogbo, commander of
the military  task force  in the area.  “The explosion was detonated in front of the customs office
today, with two officials sustaining minor injuries,” he said by
phone from the city. It may have been carried out by Islamic
militants, he said.  The incident follows yesterday’s bomb attacks on bars in
Maiduguri that killed at least 25 people. On June 25, gunmen
shot dead two people in the city, including a Muslim cleric, the
police spokesman, Lawal Abdullahi, said by phone today.  Authorities in northern Nigeria have blamed Boko Haram,
which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for
a spate of bomb attacks and killings targeting government
officials and the security forces since last year. The group
claimed responsibility for a blast on June 16 at  Nigeria ’s
police headquarters in the capital, Abuja, which killed at least
five people and injured 11.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s most populous nation with more than 140
million people, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and a predominantly Christian south. More than 14,000 people
died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West African nation
between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
