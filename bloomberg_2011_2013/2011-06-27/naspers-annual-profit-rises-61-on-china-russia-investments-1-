Naspers Ltd. (NPN) ,  Africa ’s largest media
company, said full-year profit climbed 61 percent, boosted by
its investments in  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  and  Russia ’s Mail.ru
and its pay-television unit.  Net income in the 12 months through March increased to 5.26
billion rand ($758 million) from 3.26 billion rand a year
earlier, Cape Town-based Naspers said in a statement today.
Sales increased 18 percent to 33.1 billion rand. That compared
with average analyst estimates in Bloomberg surveys of 5.79
billion rand for net income and 32.6 billion rand in revenue.  Naspers will now focus on growing existing businesses
because internet-company valuations “have become inflated and
good value is hard to find,” it said. The focus on organic
growth and developing new technologies may “dampen earnings in
the year ahead” while improving long-term growth prospects.  The company’s revenue from Tencent,  China ’s largest
Internet service provider, in which Naspers owns 35 percent,
increased 48 percent to 7.22 billion rand while trading profit
jumped 50 percent to 3.5 billion rand. The South African
company’s 30.3 percent stake in Russian Internet company
Mail.ru, which has a stake in Facebook Inc., also helped to
boost earnings.  Trading profit grew in all the group’s businesses, with the
exception of newspapers and magazines, while the number of pay-
TV subscribers in  South Africa  climbed by 637,000 to 3.5 million
and by 340,000 in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa to 1.4 million.
Naspers said its core headline earnings, its main measure of
profit, increased 13 percent to 6 billion rand.  Naspers shares’ gained 1.2 percent to 372.51 rand, where it
was trading as of 9:27 a.m. in Johannesburg, giving the company
a market value of 151.3 billion rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
