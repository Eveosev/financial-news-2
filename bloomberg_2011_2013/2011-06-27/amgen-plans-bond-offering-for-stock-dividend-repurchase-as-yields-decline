Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  sold $3 billion of bonds
in the largest debt sale this month as borrowing costs for
investment-grade companies fall to about the lowest this year.  The world’s largest biotechnology firm sold five, 10- and
31-year debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds
are slated for general corporate purposes including debt
repayment, buying back shares and quarterly dividends, the
 Thousand Oaks , California-based company said today in a
regulatory filing.  Amgen said in April it will start paying its first dividend
after its cash hoard grew to $17.4 billion. Its shares have
slumped 27 percent since the end of 2005. Yields on investment-
grade debentures fell to 3.69 percent on June 24 from 3.73
percent on June 17, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. That’s within one basis point of this year’s low on
June 1.  The $750 million of 2.3 percent, five-year notes yield 90
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the $1
billion of 4.1 percent, 10-year debt pays a spread of 120 basis
points and $1.25 billion of 5.65 percent bonds due in 2042 yield
140 basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The offering is the largest dollar-denominated debt sale
since Hewlett-Packard Co. issued $5 billion on May 25, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Issuance globally declined last week to $33.1 billion, a 16
percent decline from the $39.5 billion issued in the five days
ended June 17 and the least since $13.3 billion of debt was sold
in the period ended Dec. 31, Bloomberg data show.  Amgen last issued debt in September 2010 with a $1.5
billion two-part offering, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Its $900 million of 3.45 percent bonds due in 2020 traded
at 96.9 cents on the dollar on June 13 to yield 86.1 basis
points more than Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporters on this story:
