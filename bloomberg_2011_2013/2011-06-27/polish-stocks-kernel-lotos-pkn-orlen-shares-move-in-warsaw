Poland’s WIG20 Index fell 13.41, or
0.5 percent, to 2,788.18 in Warsaw, the lowest closing level
since March 24.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Astarta Holding NV (AST)  , a Ukrainian producer of sugar
and grains, slid by the most in more than three months, losing
3.5 zloty, or 4 percent, to 85 zloty. KSG Agro SA (KSG PW),
which sold shares in an initial public offering in April,
declined 1.07 zloty, or 4.8 percent, to 21.48 zloty.  Kernel
Holding SA (KER)  , the largest Ukrainian agriculture stock
traded in Warsaw, lost 0.5 zloty, or 0.6 percent, to 79.5 zloty.  Commodities declined ahead of a vote by Greek lawmakers
this week on a five-year austerity plan needed before the
release of a loan payment and future financing, and after the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision raised capital
sufficiency requirements.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, slid
0.6 zloty, or 1.2 percent, to 51 zloty.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  ,
the second-largest refiner, declined 1.28 zloty, or 2.8 percent,
to 44.18 zloty.  Oil prices  retreated on concern economic
expansion in the U.S. and China is slowing and as the
 International Energy Agency  said it’s prepared to release
additional crude from stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
