Treasury four-week bills traded
negative for the first time since January 2010 on quarter-end
buying amid a shrinking supply of the securities.  The one-month rate on the bill reached negative 0.0051
percent today, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The
rate is down from as high as 0.1562 percent this year on Jan.
10. The average rate is about 1.8 percent over the past decade.  Negative bill rates mean investors are willing to pay the
government to hold their money, protecting them from the
potential losses of other investments. Investors such as banks
and securities firms are often attracted to the safest
maturities at quarter-end to improve the quality of assets on
their balance sheets.  “Short-term Treasury bill rates are falling due to the
normal quarter-end demand for the securities,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in  New York  at Jefferies
Group Inc., one of the 20 primary dealers that trade directly
with the  Federal Reserve . “There is already a limited supply of
bills and the pick-up in demand ahead of the end of the quarter
is pushing rates lower.”  Bill rates have traded close to record lows as the Treasury
has reduced sales to conserve borrowing as the U.S. grapples
with increasing the federal debt limit.  The Fed has kept its target rate for overnight loans locked
at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, driving down short-
term rates to record lows. Four-week bill rates reached a record
negative 0.09 percent on Dec. 4, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
