Dish Network Corp. (DISH) ’s $1.38 billion
deal for TerreStar Networks Inc. is set to go to court for
approval after no competing bids were made for TerreStar, a
person familiar with the matter said.  TerreStar plans to proceed with the Dish deal after no
rival bids were made by a 5 p.m. deadline yesterday, said a
person with direct knowledge of the matter who didn’t want to be
identified because it isn’t public.  Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, agreed
to buy Reston, Virginia-based TerreStar out of  bankruptcy
protection , as it makes acquisitions to move beyond its
traditional pay-television business. Dish’s agreement was
subject to higher bids at an auction that had been scheduled for
June 30.  TerreStar, which provides wireless communications using a
satellite network, filed for bankruptcy last year. It put itself
up for sale after an earlier restructuring plan fell apart. It
will seek a judge’s approval for the Dish sale at a July 7
hearing at the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan , the person
said.  Marc Lumpkin, a spokesman for Englewood, Colorado-based
Dish, declined to comment. Arik Preis, a TerreStar lawyer,
didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday.  Dish’s deal for TerreStar follows moves by  Charlie Ergen ,
Dish’s chairman, to buy out of bankruptcy video-rental chain
Blockbuster Inc. and DBSD North America Inc., another satellite
communications company.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
