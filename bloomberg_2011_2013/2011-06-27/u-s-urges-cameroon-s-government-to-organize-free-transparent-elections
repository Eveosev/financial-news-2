The U.S. wants Cameroon’s government
to organize free, fair, open and transparent presidential,
parliamentary and local elections, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson said in Yaounde today.  Open public discussions are a necessary prerequisite to
free elections and any intimidation of candidates in the lead up
to the elections will be viewed as having a negative impact on
the credibility of the electoral process, he told journalists
after a series of working sessions with Cameroonian officials.  “The government of Cameroon should make sure governmental
authorities allow citizens to participate in open public
discussions about all issues of interest to the voters,” Carson
said.   Cameroonians are expected to go to the polls in October
this year to elect a President for the next seven-year term.
Incumbent Paul Biya, who has ruled the West African nation since
1982, is eligible for the election after a change of
constitution in 2008 instituting a limitless term of office.   “I did talk to the Prime Minister about the selection of
the six additional board members of ELECAM, hoping that they
will be individuals who are independent, have integrity and 
command respect,” Carson said.  ELECAM is Cameroon’s Electoral commission whose membership
has been raised to 18 from 12 after the opposition criticized
the composition of the commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
