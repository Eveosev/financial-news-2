Transnet SOC Ltd. is considering
whether to seek a private investor to help it develop a
manganese terminal at its Ngqura or Saldanha ports to help ship
the steelmaking raw material from the biggest producing nation.  Exports of manganese increased 23 percent to 4.8 million
metric tons in the 12 months to March, Transnet Chief Executive
Officer Brian Molefe told reporters in Johannesburg today.
Samancor Manganese, a South African venture between  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , is the world’s biggest manganese
producer.  Transnet expects exports of manganese will increase to
about 8.5 million a year by 2016, the state-owned ports and rail
operator said in a statement. Ngqura is on the country’s south
coast and is being developed as a new port while Saldanha, on
the west coast, is South Africa’s main  iron ore  export terminal.  Manganese is mainly exported through ports in Durban and
 Port Elizabeth . The site of a new terminal would depend on
rising exports of other minerals such as iron ore, said Molefe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
