The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 5.5 basis points to 122 basis
points as of 8:36 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc. The Markit iTraxx Japan index gained 3.5
basis points to 133.5 as of 9:38 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 3 basis points
to 122 as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices.  Credit-default swaps protect bond investors against default,
and traders use them to speculate on credit quality. A drop
signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
