BG Group Plc (BG/) , which plans to supply
Australian liquefied natural gas to clients in  Asia , signed an
agreement with Bank of  China  for up to $1.5 billion of new
funding options to expand projects.  BG already has $200 million in loans with the bank, the
company said today in a statement. The latest agreement has
increased BG’s total borrowing facilities to $4.4 billion, it
said.  “This agreement builds on our existing facilities with
Bank of China and provides the option for substantial additional
funding for our commitments in China and also our global growth
program,” BG Chief Executive Officer  Frank Chapman  said in the
statement.  Reading, England-based BG last year agreed to sell China
National Offshore Oil Corp. liquefied natural gas from
Queensland, in  Australia ’s largest export deal for the fuel at
that time. The company is also  exploring  for oil and gas
offshore China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
