Universal Studios President Ron Meyer’s contract was renewed through 2015, six months after the
maker of the “Fast and the Furious” movies became a unit of
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)   Meyer, 66, will also remain chief operating officer, NBC
Universal said today in an e-mailed statement. His previous
contract was set to expire at the end of 2012.  Universal is in second place in box-office sales in the
U.S. and  Canada  this year with $789.1 million as of June 26,
after finishing last among the major studios in 2010 and 2009,
according to researcher  Box Office Mojo . The revival has been
led by hits including “Fast Five,” the fifth in the series
about street racers, and the R-rated comedy “Bridesmaids.”  Meyer, whose responsibilities also include Universal’s
theme parks, will report to NBC Universal Chief Executive
Officer Steve Burke. Meyer has led the studio since 1995, after
serving for 20 years as president and co-founder of  Creative
Artists Agency .  Philadelphia-based Comcast, the largest U.S. cable TV
operator, paid about $13.8 billion in cash and assets for 51
percent of  NBC Universal  in a deal that closed in January.  Comcast rose 69 cents, or 3 percent, to $24.27 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
gained 10 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
