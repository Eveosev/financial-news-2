Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) , the largest
U.S. auto supplier, said it will convert a lead-acid battery
factory in  Ohio  to make an advanced, more profitable type of
vehicle battery.  The factory, near Toledo, will be able to make 6 million
absorbent glass mat batteries annually by 2013, Johnson Controls
said in a statement today. The batteries, also called AGMs, are
used in vehicles with fuel-saving features.  The new power sources sell for twice as much as the
traditional lead-acid batteries now made at the factory and are
three times as profitable, Chief Financial Officer Bruce McDonald said at an investor presentation last month. AGM
batteries have greater power to handle new fuel-saving
equipment, such as devices that turn an engine off when a
vehicle is stopped.  “We see this market growing to 35 million batteries
globally by 2015 and the  United States  is an important piece of
the market,” Alex Molinaroli, president of Johnson Control’s
battery unit, said in today’s statement.  Johnson Controls will spend $138.5 million to convert the
facility, which employs about 400 people. The conversion will
add 50 jobs, the statement said. Johnson Controls produced more
than 120 million lead-acid batteries in the year ended Sept. 30.  Johnson Controls rose 35 cents to $39.52 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have risen
3.5 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
