New Jersey officials are negotiating
a temporary  bank loan  with  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  of as much as
$2.25 billion to cover a revenue gap in its new fiscal year, the
Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the deal.  The state is considering tapping a so-called bridge loan,
or credit line, to cover bills coming due early in the year
beginning July 1 as it prepares to sell tax-revenue anticipation
notes to cover expenses until it collects taxes, the newspaper
said on its website. The notes would repay the bank loan.  The newspaper said state officials are negotiating with
JPMorgan following competition for the business. A bank
spokesman, whom the newspaper didnâ€™t identify, declined to
comment. A spokesman for  New Jersey , also unidentified, also
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
