A single options bet that oil and
gas companies will extend losses lifted put volume for an
exchange-traded fund tracking the industry to a six-week high.  Almost 38,000 puts to sell the  SPDR S&P Oil & Gas
Exploration & Production ETF (XOP)  changed hands as of 4 p.m. in  New
York , 3.4 times the four-week average, as the fund fell 0.1
percent to $55.08. An investor sold 10,000 September $59 puts to
purchase 20,000 September $54 puts, according to a report from
today Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP in  Bala Cynwyd ,
 Pennsylvania .  “They’re extending a winning bet,” according to Frederic Ruffy, a senior options strategist at WhatsTrading.com, a New
York-based provider of options-market analytics. “They made a
substantially bearish bet earlier this month and now they’re
extending it and positioning themselves for further losses.”  The ETF tracking 75 companies has dropped 9.5 percent this
month, more than the 5.7 percent slide for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index. Oil retreated 55 cents to $90.61 a barrel, the lowest
since Feb. 18, as data showed U.S. consumer spending stagnated
last month and after the  International Energy Agency  said it’s
prepared to release more crude from stockpiles.  The September $59 puts had an open interest of 10,410
outstanding contracts before today. The total increased by 5,000
on May 26 and then about the same amount June 1, Bloomberg data
show. The price of the puts has surged 66 percent to $6.30 since
May 26, when the ETF closed at $59.88.  To contact the reporters on this story:
