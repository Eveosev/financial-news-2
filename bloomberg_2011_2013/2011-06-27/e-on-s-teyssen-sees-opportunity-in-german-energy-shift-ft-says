E.ON AG (EOAN) ’s Chief Executive Officer
Johannes Teyssen said  Germany ’s move away from nuclear power
will turn the country into “a laboratory for the accelerated
switch to renewable energy,” the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview. “Eon will position itself in this process
-- and then take what it learns out into the world,” Teyssen
said, according to the FT.  The government’s decision to phase out nuclear power by
2022 instead of 2036 “will have an impact on our business,”
while also offering “a huge opportunity to develop new
technologies and business models,” the newspaper cited Teyssen
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
