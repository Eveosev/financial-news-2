South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  and its labor-federation ally, the Congress of
South African Trade Unions, may clash over who will takeover the
leadership of the party, IOL said.  Paul Mashatile, the ANC’s Gauteng chairman, said a
disciplined discussion on the party’s leadership should begin
before the ANC’s elective conference next year, the
Johannesburg-based website said, citing Mashatile. Cosatu
General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi doesn’t want to start the
discussion too early, IOL said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
