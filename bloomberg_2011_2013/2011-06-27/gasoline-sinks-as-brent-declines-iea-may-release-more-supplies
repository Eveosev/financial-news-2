Gasoline and heating oil rose as
 Brent crude  oil reversed an earlier loss and the dollar
weakened, increasing the investment appeal of commodities.  Futures rebounded after touching the lowest level since
February as Brent crude on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
jumped, boosting production costs for refiners in Europe and on
the U.S. East Coast that process oil versus the European
benchmark. The U.S. currency dropped 0.6 percent against the
euro as of 3:13 p.m. in New York.  “We failed to break the 200-day moving average on Brent,
giving it a little bit of a bounce, and the dollar is on the
defensive,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the
Energy Management Institute in New York. “This is going to be a
choppy market for a while.”  Gasoline for July delivery gained 3.09 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $2.8075 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have dropped 11 percent this month
and by 9.7 percent in the quarter that ends June 30.  Prices touched $2.7348 earlier, the lowest level since Feb.
28, after the  International Energy Agency  said it will release
more oil from emergency stockpiles if needed. IEA Executive
Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said the agency could release more than
the previously announced 60 million barrels of oil.  “The IEA release is going to be mostly sweet crude and
products, which pressures Brent price and gasoline since the
East Coast imports a significant amount of gasoline priced off
Brent,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Third Release  The IEA said 28 countries, including the U.S., will release
reserve stockpiles, marking only the third time in 30 years for
such an action.  “There are uncertainties that have been introduced by the
oil release and by the prospect of more,” said  Tom Knight , vice
president of trading and supply at Truman Arnold Cos. in
Texarkana,  Texas .  Gasoline and heating oil premiums over crude oil on Nymex
increased as Brent on the ICE Futures Europe exchange gained
more than West Texas Intermediate oil.  “Products continue to trend much, much closer to Brent,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The premium for gasoline, or the crack spread, based on
August futures, increased $1.74 to $24.65 a barrel on the
exchange, while the August heating oil crack spread gained $1.08
to $26.21.  WTI-Brent Spread  The WTI-Brent spread, based on August futures, was $15.38 a
barrel, from $13.96 on June 24.  “The Brent/WTI spread moved out a little, the euro popped
a little and all the metals are off their lows,” said Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Gasoline was the second-best performer, behind cocoa, on
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities. The
index fell 0.4 percent as 10 of 19 contracts declined.  U.S. inventories of gasoline probably rose 775,000 barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Supplies of industrial, trucking and
home-heating fuels probably increased 1.05 million barrels.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 1 cent to $3.565
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website. It’s the lowest
level since March 24.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.46 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $2.7649 a gallon on the exchange, after
touching $2.715, the lowest level since Feb. 18. Heating oil has
dropped by 9.5 percent in June and by 11 percent this quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
