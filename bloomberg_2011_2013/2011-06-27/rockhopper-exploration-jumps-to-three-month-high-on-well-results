Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH)  advanced
to a three-month high in London trading after reporting
“commercially viable” flow rates from a well in the North
Falkland Basin.  Rockhopper jumped as much as 11 percent to 305.75 pence,
the highest since March 21, and traded at 281 pence as of 8:35
a.m. local time.  The 14/10-5 appraisal well flowed at stabilized rates of
5,508 barrels a day with a maximum rate of 9,036 barrels a day,
the Salisbury, England-based company said today in a statement.  Rockhopper surged 10 percent on June 1 following the
announcement of a “significant” oil and gas discovery at the
Sea Lion field. It now plans to drill a third appraisal well
about 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) west of the 14/10-5 well.  “This very positive well test result is another key
milestone in establishing Sea Lion commerciality,” Chief
Executive Officer Sam Moody said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
