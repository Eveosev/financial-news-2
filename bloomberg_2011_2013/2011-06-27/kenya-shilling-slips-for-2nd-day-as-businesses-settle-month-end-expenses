Kenya ’s shilling weakened for a
second day against the dollar as businesses bought the U.S.
currency to settle month-end costs.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 90.80 per dollar and traded 0.1
percent down at 90.60 by 2:31 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. The
currency is 1.45 shillings stronger than a 17-year low of 92.05
per dollar reached on June 22.  “The weakening is due to increased dollar demand
occasioned by businesses settling their end-of-month
obligations,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African
Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  Kenya’s shilling has depreciated 11 percent against the
dollar this year, ranking it the world’s third-worst performer
after Suriname’s dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa. The East African
nation is grappling with 13 percent inflation, up from 3.2
percent in October, as the price of corn, the nation’s staple
food, soared 31 percent in the period.  The bank will “consider further tightening of monetary
policy to tame future inflation, and stabilize the  exchange
rate ,” Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said on June 23.
