Kuwait Finance Minister Mustafa al- Shimali proposed amending a draft budget law to raise spending
allocations for the current fiscal year by 1.77 billion dinars
($6.4 billion),  Al-Qabas  reported, citing a letter to
parliamentâ€™s budgets committee.  The proposed increase is to help cover benefits and wage
increases for Kuwaitis, the newspaper said.  Al-Shimali said in January that the government planned to
increase spending by about 10 percent, to 17.9 billion dinars,
in the fiscal year that started in April. Revenue was estimated
at 13.5 billion dinars, al-Shimali said then.  The draft budget is scheduled to be debated by parliament
on June 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
