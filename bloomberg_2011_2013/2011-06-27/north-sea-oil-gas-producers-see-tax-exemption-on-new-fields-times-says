U.K. Treasury officials are in talks
with North Sea oil and gas producers to try to avoid having a

got the information.  The producers are showing growing optimism that an Energy
and Climate Change Committee hearing tomorrow will be told that
new fields will be exempt from the tax, the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
