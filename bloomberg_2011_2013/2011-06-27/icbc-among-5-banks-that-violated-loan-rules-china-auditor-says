Industrial & Commercial Bank of
China (601398)  Ltd. is among five mainland lenders that loaned 58 billion
yuan ($9 billion) in violation of credit rules, according to the
nation’s auditors.  About 25.4 billion yuan in loans to projects didn’t have
the required approval and documents or lacked adequate paid-in
capital, according to the  transcript  of a speech by Liu Jiayi,
the country’s auditor-general, that was posted on the agency’s
website today. The audit office examined 347.2 billion yuan of
new advances in an annual probe into central and local
governments’ budget implementation, it said.  Chinese policy makers are grappling with risks stemming
from the 7.95 trillion yuan of new loans made by banks last year
and an unprecedented 9.6 trillion yuan in 2009 to fuel the
nation’s economic growth following the global recession. Banks’
non-performing loans may climb to 5 to 10 percent of total
advances in three years,  Standard & Poor’s  said last month.  ICBC, the world’s most profitable lender, had 7.06 trillion
yuan of loans outstanding as of March 31, with a bad-debt ratio
of 1 percent. The state-run lender’s Beijing-based press officer,
Wang Zhenning, declined to comment.  Some of the loans were misused to pay other debt, Liu said
without elaborating. The agency didn’t name the other four banks.  --Luo Jun. Editors: Chitra Somayaji, Russell Ward  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
