Canada ’s dollar swung to a gain
versus its U.S. counterpart after touching the lowest level in
more than three months as U.S. stocks climbed and losses in
commodities such as crude oil were tempered.  The Canadian currency, sometimes called the loonie, headed
for a 1.8 percent drop in June after a 2.4 percent decline in
the previous month. Futures traders reduced bets the  Bank of
Canada  will raise  interest rates  in 2011 after Canadian and U.S.
policy makers reduced growth estimates.  “Everything turned on a dime with equities,” said  Steve Butler , director of foreign-exchange trading in Toronto at Bank
of Nova Scotia’s Scotia Capital unit. “I don’t see it too much
lower with commodities not looking too well supported,” he
said, referring to the  U.S. dollar .  Canada’s dollar appreciated 0.3 percent to 98.61 cents per
U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 98.86 cents on
June 24. The loonie earlier fell as much as 0.3 percent to 99.13
cents, the weakest level since March 17. One Canadian dollar
buys $1.0141.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.9 percent, the first
gain in four days, after regulators issued new capital rules to
safeguard the global financial system. The MSCI World, an index
of developed-market stocks, advanced 0.5 percent.  Crude futures for August delivery dropped as much as 1.7
percent to $89.61 a barrel in  New York , before trading at $90.81
a barrel, down 0.4 percent.  Two-Month Loss  The loonie is headed for the first two-month loss in a year
as rising concern that debt-strapped  Greece  will default and an
economic slowdown in the U.S. makes interest-rate increases by
the Bank of Canada less likely, according to wagers made by
futures traders.  The yield on the December 2011 bankers’ acceptances futures
contract slipped to 1.33 percent today, the lowest since the
contract started trading in December 2008, indicating traders
are trimming bets on a rate increase this year.  “Risk dynamics and commodity performance have proved to
favor the U.S. dollar overall at the expense of currencies like
the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar,” said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director of foreign-exchange strategy at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “We have rate
strips in Australian dollars and Canadian dollars moving higher,
which is limiting rate support for the currencies,” he said,
referring to the so-called Bax contracts, whose yield falls as
the price climbs.  Through Parity  Stretch predicted the currency could depreciate through
parity and beyond versus the greenback should Greek lawmakers
fail to pass austerity measures. Greek lawmakers is starting
today to debate the 78 billion-euro ($111 billion) budget
package that officials say is needed to receive a loan payment
and future financing.  “Should Greek politicians press the nuclear buttons we
could rally toward C$1.0060 per U.S. dollar relatively easily
and potentially above there, C$1.02,” Stretch said.  Canadian consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in May from a
year earlier, matching April’s pace, according to the median of
24 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  Statistics Canada  is due to
report the data on June 29 in Ottawa.  Yields on 10-year Government of Canada bonds rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.90 percent after
touching 2.84 percent, the lowest level since November. The
price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in June 2021 slid 38
cents to C$102.97.  To contact the reporter on this story:
