Tea shipments from  Kenya , the
world’s biggest exporter of the black variety of the leaves,
climbed 11 percent to 34.4 million kilograms (75.8 million
pounds) in May, the  Tea Board of Kenya  said today.  Egypt was the biggest importer of Kenyan tea, taking about
19 percent, followed by the U.K., Afghanistan, Pakistan and
Sudan, the Nairobi-based board said in an e-mailed statement.  Kenyan production of tea in the five months through May
decreased by 18 percent to 149.5 million kilograms, due to low
and poorly distributed rain in most growing regions, it said.  Average tea prices at sales in May in the port city of
 Mombasa , the world’s largest auction for tea, stood at $2.88 a
kilogram compared with $2.53 a kilogram a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
