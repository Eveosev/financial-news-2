Russia’s Micex Index fell for the
second day in three after oil slid below $90 as the
 International Energy Agency  said it’s prepared to release more
stockpiles, hurting the outlook for producers.  The 30-stock Micex dropped 0.5 percent to 1,625.42 by 10:59
a.m. in Moscow. Oil producers OAO Gazprom Neft and OAO Lukoil
slipped 1.3 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. OAO  Uralkali (URKA) ,
the country’s largest potash producer, decreased 1 percent. The
dollar-denominated RTS Index lost 0.4 percent to 1,849.6.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, declined as much as
$1.34 to $89.82 a barrel in New York after the International
Energy Agency said it’s prepared to take further steps to
stabilize prices after a June 23 pledge to inject 2 million
barrels a day for 30 days.  “A decline in  oil prices  may continue through November --
that means additional currency risk for ruble-denominated
investments,” Elena Matrosova, a Moscow-based economist at BDO
International, a financial adviser that lists the central bank
among its clients, said in a telephone interview. “It’s not
exactly the right time for investments in Russian equities.”  -- With assistance by Halia Pavliva in  New York  Editors: Alex
