KKR & Co., the New York-based
leveraged-buyout firm, received a license from  Saudi Arabia ’s
Capital Market Authority to operate in the kingdom.  The authority authorized KKR Saudi Ltd. Co. to “conduct
arranging,” a statement on the Saudi bourse website said.  KKR is among international private-equity firms including
Carlyle Group that are expanding in the  Middle East  as oil
revenue boosts regional economies. The firms are seeking smaller
deals than the transactions in excess of $10 billion that
dominated the LBO market before the credit crisis.  In December, KKR named Kaveh Samie as managing director and
head of Middle East and North Africa, replacing Makram Azar, who
moved to Barclays Plc. Reuters reported the license earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
