Jordan plans to sign an agreement
with Estonia for the construction of a power plant in the Arab
kingdom that would burn shale oil and generate 600 to 900
megawatts of electricity,  Al Arab Al Yawm  reported.  The agreement with Estonia, the only country where oil
shale is the primary source of energy, would be part of Jordanâ€™s
effort to exploit local resources to reduce its dependence on
imported oil and gas, the Amman-based newspaper reported, citing
an unidentified person at the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources. Jordan estimates its total shale oil holdings at
about 42 billion metric tons, which the government wants to
develop for electricity generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
