Most large U.S. banks that
weathered the financial crisis by strengthening the level and
quality of their capital should be able to pass future stress
tests, said a researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank of  San
Francisco .  Banks have managed over the past two years to improve their
 capital ratios , regardless of whether they participated in the
stress tests of 2009, Fred Furlong, a group vice president in
the San Francisco Fed’s economic research department, said in a
paper released today, without identifying the banks.  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  are among those that took steps
to bolster their capital positions in 2009.  “The capital positions of large banking organizations
should be strong enough to allow most of them to pass stress
tests more routinely,” given their recent improvements in
capital and other changes, Furlong wrote.  Global central bank governors agreed this weekend on extra
capital rules for banks whose size or systemic importance means
their failure could cause another financial crisis. Regulators
agreed that as many as 30 of the world’s largest lenders should
face surcharges that range from 1 percentage point to as much as
2.5 percentage points of core capital to prevent them from
causing another financial crisis.  Capital rules, known as Basel III, are scheduled to be
phased in from 2013 through 2019. The  Bank for International
Settlements  is the parent organization of both the  Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision  and the Group of Governors and
Heads of Supervision, which oversees the committee’s work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
