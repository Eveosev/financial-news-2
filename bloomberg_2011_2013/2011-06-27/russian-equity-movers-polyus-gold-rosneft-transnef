The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  slid 0.4
percent to 1,626.95 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, paring an
earlier loss of as much as 1.1 percent. The dollar-denominated
RTS Index declined 0.8 percent to 1,842.2.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Polyus Gold (PLZL RX), Russia’s largest gold producer,
fell for a seventh day, its worst losing streak since January.
The shares fell 2.3 percent to 1,761.8 rubles. Gold retreated
$2.80 to $1,498.10 an ounce as weaker  oil prices  and a pledge by
European Union leaders to avert a Greek default pared the
metal’s appeal as a haven.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN RX),  Russia ’s largest oil producer,
slipped to its lowest in more than a month as crude dropped
below $90 a barrel in  New York . The shares fell 1.1 percent to
228.78 rubles, its worst close since May 24.  OAO Transneft (TRNFP RX) dropped for a fourth day after
Arkady Dvorkovich, economic aide to President  Dmitry Medvedev ,
said Russia’s oil pipeline operator is “not a priority” for
state asset sales. The stock lost 2 percent to 40,126 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
