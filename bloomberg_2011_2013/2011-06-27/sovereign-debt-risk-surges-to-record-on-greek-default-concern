The cost of insuring European
sovereign debt rose to a record on concern  Greece  will default
if its government fails to pass an austerity plan this week,
triggering a banking crisis across the region.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose 3 basis points to a record
246 at 11:30 a.m. in London. Swaps on Greece climbed 28 basis
points to 2,143, signaling an 84 percent probability of default
within five years, according to CMA.  Prime Minister  George Papandreou  needs to unite his
lawmakers in two votes on a 78 billion-euro package ($110.8
billion) of budget cuts and asset sales before Greece can tap a
fifth loan payment from last year’s 110 billion-euro rescue. The
 European Central Bank  has warned a Greek collapse would cripple
the nation’s lenders and hurt banks across the region that are
already under pressure to bolster capital.  “If Greece will end in an uncontrolled debt restructuring,
the risk of a run on Greek banks and of that spilling over to
other banking systems is quite high,” said  Philip Gisdakis , a
strategist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. “Although most people
still say their base case expectation is that it will go
through, people are concerned about what’s going to happen if
this vote is going to fail.”  Contracts on Ireland jumped as much as 27 basis points to a
record 832 and  Portugal  increased 21.5 to an all-time high of
859.5, while Spain and  Italy  rose to the highest levels since
January. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit
quality .  Market Discomfort  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 European banks and insurers increased 4 basis points to 180
and the subordinated index climbed 5.5 to 310.5, the highest
since Jan. 12, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “Now it appears that international financial stability
rests on a few Greek politicians and people are not so
comfortable with that,” Gisdakis said.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose as much as 2 basis points to
116.75 basis points, the highest since Nov. 30, and was trading
at 115.75 basis points, according to JPMorgan.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 9
basis points to 437, the highest since Jan. 11.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
