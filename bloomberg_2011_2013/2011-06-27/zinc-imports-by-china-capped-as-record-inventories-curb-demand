Zinc imports by  China , the largest
user, may be capped even after the government lowered tariffs on
shipments of the metal, as record domestic stockpiles curb
demand for overseas purchases.  “Zinc isn’t something China is really short of, like
copper, so the tariff cut won’t really help imports,” said Wang
Xiang, an analyst at Cofco Futures Co. Net imports may grow
20,000 metric tons, or 7 percent, to about 300,000 tons this
year, unchanged from an earlier estimate, Wang said.  Zinc, the worst performer on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
this year, has fallen 13 percent as stockpiles climbed to a
record. The duty on imports will be cut to 1 percent from 3
percent starting from July 1, the Ministry of Finance  said  June
24. The metal is used mainly to galvanize steel.  “China’s consumption won’t grow as fast as last year as
downstream sectors, including auto, slow down,” said Annett
Huang, chief China representative of the International Zinc
Association. “So the duty cut won’t be able to boost imports.”  Zinc for delivery in September on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange closed today 1.5 percent lower at 17,190 yuan ($2,654),
including a 17 percent value-added tax. Three-month zinc on the
London Metal Exchange fell 0.8 percent to $2,236 a ton.  Total zinc stockpiles in China reached 628,500 tons in mid-
April, and fell to 598,500 tons at the end of June, according to
data provider SMM Information & Technology Co. Given the supply
glut, domestic prices may be under greater pressure in the
short-term, and this means imports will continue to be
unprofitable, even after the duty cut, SMM analyst Lei Xiaoli
said.  Imports Tumble  China’s zinc imports halved to 323,354 tons last year,
while exports totaled 43,143 tons, according to the General
Administration of Customs. In the first five months of this
year, imports rose 16 percent from a year ago to 141,955 tons.  Zinc for immediate delivery in Shanghai is traded at 17,100
a ton today, while many smelters need the price to reach 17,500
a ton to be profitable, so “perhaps the policy is aimed at
curbing domestic capacity growth as this would be another blow
to the smelters,” Lei said.  China produced a record 5.27 million tons of zinc in 2010,
up 20 percent from the previous year, according to the National
Bureau of Statistics. Output in May fell 3.7 percent to 419,000
tons from 435,000 tons in April.  “The weakness in output represents to us conscious smelter
production cuts in response to lower demand from the galvanized
steel sector,”  Barclays Capital  said in a research report on
June 14. “We view this zinc data as a bearish representation of
weak Chinese fundamentals.”  Output Decline  “A power shortage in the months ahead and falling
treatment charges may lead to a further drop in zinc output in
the coming months, which could be a reason for the cut in  import
taxes ,” said He Qi, head of research at Yinjian Futures Co.  An electricity shortfall this summer may be as much as 40
gigawatts, surpassing the 2004 record, according to State Grid
Corp. of China. Power prices for industrial and commercial users
in 15 provinces were increased on June 1, according to the
National Development and Reform Commission.  Some smelters have brought forward their repair and
maintenance plans amid a sluggish market, SMM’s Lei said. Two of
the biggest producers in China are Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. and
 Huludao Zinc Industry Co. (000751)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
