Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore miner, cut its target for 2015 output by 10 percent.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company expects to produce 469
million metric tons a year of the steelmaking ingredient by that
time, compared with an Oct. 28 forecast of 522 million tons, it
said today in an e-mailed statement. No more details were given.  Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira, who replaced  Roger Agnelli  this year after the Brazilian government criticized
Vale’s strategy, is cutting targets amid concern raw materials
demand in China will slow as the country boosts  interest rates 
to combat quickening inflation. The benchmark Standard & Poor’s
GSCI commodity index is heading for a second monthly drop.  “They were being a bit optimistic about the 2015 target,”
Leonardo Alves, an analyst at Link Investimentos, said today by
telephone from  Sao Paulo . He rates the stock “outperform.”  Vale produced 71.5 million metric tons of  iron ore  in the
first quarter, up 3.6 percent from a year ago, it said May 6.  The company is seeking to boost output from about 308
million tons a year now to meet rising demand from steelmakers
in  Asia , where the company is competing with rivals BHP Billiton
Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group. The company is buying ships in China
and also setting up distribution centers in the region  Vale fell 15 centavos, or 0.3 percent, to 43.95 reais as of
2:49 p.m. in Sao Paulo and has declined about 9.4 percent this
year, compared with a 12 percent drop for the Bovespa Index.  Year-End Investments  Total year-end investments may be about $20 billion, less
than the $24 billion included in the company’s budget, Chief
Financial Officer Guilherme Cavalcanti said May 6 on a
conference call with analysts. The company, which is delaying
the start of four projects, faces equipment, workforce and
licensing “constraints,” he said. Chief Executive Ferreira has
said that the current $24 billion budget remains.  Steel demand in  China , the world’s biggest consumer, may
rise by as much as a quarter by 2015 from last year, according
to a projection from the China Iron & Steel Association, which
represents producers.  Vale plans to boost iron ore output by 1 percent to 311
million tons this year. It will invest $2.9 billion to expand
iron ore capacity at the Carajas mine, the world’s largest, and
to improve logistics to its port terminal at the Port
of Ponta da Madeira, in Maranhao, Brazil. It will also invest
$861 million in 2011 to start producing iron ore and rebuild a
railway for its Simandou project in  Guinea , and $681 million to
boost copper output at its Salobo mines in Para state,  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
