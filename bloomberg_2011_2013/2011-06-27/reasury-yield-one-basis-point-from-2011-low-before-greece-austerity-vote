Treasury two-year note yields rose
from almost a record low before today’s $35 billion auction of
the securities on bets  Greece ’s lawmakers will approve austerity
measures needed to secure a bailout.  Yields on 10-year notes increased for the first time in
four days as the German government welcomed proposals from
French banks and insurers on voluntary participation in a
roll-over of Greek debt. Four-week bill rates traded negative
today for the first time in more than a year on quarter-end
buying amid a shrinking supply of the securities.  “At these levels, we are really pricing for a complete
disaster,” said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. rates strategy
for fixed-income and currencies in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada, one of the 20 primary dealers obligated to participate
in U.S. government debt offerings “Things are bad in  Europe  and
the economy is much weaker than we’d like it to be here, but we
are not at a point where buying the two-year at 35 basis points
makes sense.”  Yields on two-year notes gained three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 0.36 percent at 11:22 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 0.5 percent
security maturing in May 2013 fell 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000
face amount, to 100 1/4.  The two-year note yields dropped on June 24 to 0.32
percent, the lowest level since Nov. 4, when they reached a
record low 0.3118 percent.  Ten-Year Yields  Yields on 10-year notes advanced two basis points to 2.88
percent after falling earlier today to 2.84 percent, the lowest
level since Dec. 1. The rate on the four-week bill was negative
0.005 percent, the lowest since January 2010. The yield on the
30-year bond climbed as much as five basis points to 4.24
percent, the highest level since June 21.  Greek lawmakers begin a three-day debate today on the
78 billion euro ($111 billion) of austerity measures, with a
vote expected to be on June 29. Failure to pass the plan may
lead to the euro area’s first sovereign default.  “Even though the vote will be tough, the market still
thinks it will go through,” said  Michael Franzese , managing
director and head of trading at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in
New York. “The world’s not coming to an end.”  At a press conference in Paris, President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
said French banks and insurers proposed rolling over 70 percent
of their holdings of Greek debt on a voluntary basis.  ‘Private Sector’  “The German government welcomes it when proposals come
from the private sector, including those on private-creditor
participation that are now coming out of  France ,” the German
Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kreienbaum told reporters in
Berlin today.  In the U.S., the government is scheduled to sell
$99 billion of notes this week starting with today’s offering of
two-year debt. The Treasury plans to sell $35 billion of
five-year securities tomorrow, followed by a $29 billion sale of
seven-year notes on June 29.  The two-year debt scheduled for sale today yielded 0.38
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 0.56 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on May 24.  Investors bid for 3.46 times the amount of debt on offer
last month, compared with an average of 3.39 for the past 10
sales. Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks,
bought 31.3 percent of the notes. Direct bidders, non-primary
dealers buying for their own accounts, purchased 19.1 percent,
the most this year.  Fed Debt Buying  The  Federal Reserve  purchased $4.578 billion of securities
maturing from June 2015 and September 2016 today as part of its
$600 billion program of debt buying expiring this week.  The central bank said on June 22 that it will continue to
buy Treasuries with proceeds from the maturing debt it currently
owns. That could mean purchases of as much as $300 billion of
government debt over the next 12 months without adding money to
the financial system.  U.S. consumer spending unexpectedly stagnated in May after
an increase of 0.3 percent in the previous month, the Commerce
Department reported. The median forecast of 70 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.1 percent increase.  Treasuries have returned 1 percent in the past month as of
the end of last week, extending their gain this year to 3.6
percent, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  “Right now It’s time to stay out of the way rather than
taking a lot of the risk in the fixed-income market,’’ RBC’s
Cloherty said. “If we do get any sign that the economic numbers
aren’t as bad as people are assuming, we could see a significant
rise in yields.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
