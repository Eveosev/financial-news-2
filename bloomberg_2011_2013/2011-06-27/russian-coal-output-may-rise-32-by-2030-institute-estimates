Russia’s annual coal production may
rise almost a third to 420 million metric tons by 2030,
according to the Energy Research Institute of the Russian
Academy of Sciences.  The estimate is the institute’s most optimal for the
industry, Deputy Director Yuri Plakitkin said today at the 5th
Coaltrans Russia and CIS conference in Moscow. Exports of the
commodity may increase to between 170 million and 180 million
tons under that forecast, he said. Russia produced 317 million
tons of coal in 2010 and shipped about 115.7 million tons,
according to the Federal State Statistics Service.  “The outlook for Russian exports growth and coal
production generally is certainly very positive,” Steve Hulton,
principal coal supply analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said at the
conference.  While transportation expenses as a portion of production
costs are higher than in other nations, Russian metallurgical
coal is competitive on the world market because its higher
quality bolsters margins, Hulton said.  Annual Russian coal output may come to between 320 million
and 330 million tons by 2030 under the  institute ’s midrange
forecast, Plakitkin said. Exports in that case may amount to 120
million to 150 million tons, he said.  The institute’s least optimistic projection is for
production of at least 290 million tons of coal a year by 2030
with exports of between 80 million and 90 million tons,
according to Plakitkin.  The estimates depend on world oil prices and the state of
the coal market, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
