A 34-year-old woman who works at a
U.K. newswire has been arrested as part of an ongoing
investigation into phone hacking by journalists.  The woman, who wasn’t identified, was arrested at a central
London police station on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting
mobile-phone voice-mail messages, police said. The Press
Association said one of its reporters was being held by police
in connection with the probe.  She is the fifth person arrested as part of the
investigation into the phone-hacking probe that is centered on
 News Corp. (NWS) ’s News of the World newspaper. The other four
arrested were linked to the weekly tabloid including the
questioning last week of a 39-year-old woman who had contributed
freelance stories.  Officials at the London-based Press Association declined to
comment beyond a statement that confirmed the arrest. Daisy Dunlop, a spokeswoman for News International, News Corp.’s U.K.
unit, wasn’t immediately able to comment.  London police in April arrested News of the World reporter
James Weatherup. The paper’s former news editor, Ian Edmondson,
and former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck have also been
arrested as part of the investigation.  The paper’s former royal reporter,  Clive Goodman , and
private investigator  Glenn Mulcaire  were jailed in 2007 for
accessing mobile-phone voice-mail boxes of members of the royal
household.  News Corp. (NWSA)  has apologized to some of the more than two-
dozen celebrities that have sued over the allegations and has
reached settlements with actress  Sienna Miller  and sports
commentator Andy Gray.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
