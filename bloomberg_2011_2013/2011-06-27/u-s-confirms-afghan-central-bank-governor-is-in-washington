Afghanistan ’s central bank governor,
Abdul Qadeer Fitrat, is in Washington after he was reported to
have fled Kabul because he feared for his life.  “We’re not aware of an asylum request,” State Department
spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. “We do know that he
is in Washington.”  The Financial Times reported today that Fitrat flew to the
U.S. after identifying people who profited from a scandal at
Kabul Bank, the country’s biggest lender which nearly collapsed
last September and is now under the control of Afghanistan’s
central bank.  Fitrat, who spoke to the FT from a location in Washington’s
Virginia suburbs, said he had resigned and flown to the U.S. a
week ago after receiving information his life was in danger.  “If there were to be a change of leadership at the Afghan
Central Bank, we would continue to encourage that government to
take all the necessary steps to reform and strengthen the
financial sector,” Nuland said at the news briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
