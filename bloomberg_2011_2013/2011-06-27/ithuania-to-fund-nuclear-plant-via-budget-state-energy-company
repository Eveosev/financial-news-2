Lithuania  will finance the
government’s share in a planned nuclear power plant through the
budget and state energy company VAE, President Dalia Grybauskaite said.  “It will be done not only by the state budget but by the
state energy company,” Grybauskaite said in an interview in
Brussels June 22 before the EU summit. “Latvian, Estonian and
Polish companies are still pledging and would like to
participate in the project.”  Lithuania, together with its two Baltic neighbors and
 Poland , plans to build a nuclear plant in Visaginas by 2020 to
diversify the region’s energy resources after the closure of the
Soviet-era Ignalina atomic facility at the end of 2009.
Pittsburgh, PA-based Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Hitachi-GE
Nuclear Energy Ltd. are competing to supply equipment and
acquire a controlling stake in the plant.  Lithuania is “satisfied” to have received the two bids
this month, Grybauskaite said. It’s too early to say how
attractive the proposals are as talks are continuing, he added.  A strategic investor may be offered as much as 51 percent
in the project, while the remainder would be split between
Lithuania,  Latvia , Estonia and Poland, the government has said.
The plant may cost 5 billion euros ($7 billion), according to
official estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
