Rainfall “enormously” helped  Black
Earth Farming Ltd. (BEFSDB) ’s grain crops in central Russia and yields
may be normal this season after drought parched fields last
year, Chief Executive Officer Richard Warburton said.  “I don’t think we are in a 2010 situation,” Warburton
told journalists at a Renaissance Capital investor conference in
Moscow today. “I think we are in a more normal year, hopefully
within the normal crop-yield volatility,”  Moisture levels rose in the company’s fields after rainfall
last week, and more rain is forecast next week, while the
weather in July remains crucial for the crop, Warburton said.
“It’s still a long way to go before we know enough to be
categoric about the harvest,” he said. The company’s harvest-
target was 700,000 metric tons of grain, with 75 percent of that
wheat, Chief Financial Officer Michael Shneyderman said June 2.  Russia  experienced its most severe drought in at least half
a century last year, slashing the total grains harvest 37
percent to 60.9 million tons. Russian farmers may reap between
82 million and 86 million tons of grains this year on good
sowing results and favorable weather, Moscow-based researcher
SovEcon said today, raising a previous estimate.  St Helier, Jersey-based Black Earth Farming controlled
328,000 hectares (810,500 acres) at the end of last year, with
more than 180,000 hectares in production, according to its
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
