Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR) , the world’s
biggest operator of land-based wind parks, agreed to buy 700
million euros ($993 million) of turbines from  Siemens AG (SIE)  for its
first offshore project.  Iberdrola Renovables’ ScottishPower unit is building the
389-megawatt West of Duddon Sands wind farm in the  Irish Sea 
with Danish utility Dong Energy A/S. It will cost 1.6 billion
pounds ($2.56 billion) and will generate enough power for
300,000 homes when it goes into operation in 2014, Iberdrola
Renovables said today in a  statement .  Britain has more turbines installed at sea than any other
country and this project will help it reach its goal of having
13 gigawatts in operation by 2020, to meet European Union
renewable energy targets.  Siemens will design, transport and install 108 turbines,
each with capacity of 3.6 megawatts. The turbines will use
gears, Alfons Benzinger, a spokesman for Munich-based Siemens,
said today by phone, though the company also has a model that
doesn’t contain gears.  Dong and Bilbao-based Iberdrola Renovables  said  they will
fund the wind farm equally and expect to award additional
contracts this year. The project, 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) off
the coast of Barrow-in-Furness in northern  England , also
includes an offshore transmission line that will be sold to an
operator once it goes into operation.  The companies have commissioned two installation vessels,
according to the statement. Under a separate contract, Siemens
will provide maintenance for the turbines for five years.
Delivery is expected in mid-2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
