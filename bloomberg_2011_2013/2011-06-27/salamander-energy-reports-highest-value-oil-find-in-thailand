Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , the U.K.-
based oil and gas explorer focused on southeast  Asia , reported a
“material” oil discovery in the Bualuang East Terrace well in
 Thailand . Shares rose.  The well encountered about 35 meters of net oil pay within
three zones. The reservoir may contain about 50 million barrels
of oil in place and as much as 14 million barrels recoverable,
the company said in a statement in  London  today.  “These are the highest value barrels in our portfolio,”
Chief Executive Officer James Menzies said in a telephone
interview today. “This discovery prolongs the life of the field
and will keep production on plateau for more than three years.”  The Bualuang field will make up half the company’s
production base by 2013 as it targets output of 30,000 barrels
of oil equivalent a day from about 22,000 barrels this year.
Salamander had drilled four of a planned 13 exploration and
production wells this year and is generating more cash than it
is spending on investment, Menzies said.  Salamander climbed as much as 9 percent in London and
traded at 269 pence as of 8:58 a.m. local time.  “This discovery is significant as it adds high value
barrels to the company’s reserves as well as de-risking the Far
East terrace prospect,” said  Richard Rose , an analyst at Oriel
Securities Ltd. in London, in an e-mailed note. “We re-iterate
our Buy recommendation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
