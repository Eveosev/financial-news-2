The  International Monetary Fund  is
encouraged by Seychelles’ progress in implementing structural
economic reforms, the Washington-based institution said in an e-
mailed statement.  The changes include preparations to introduce value-added
tax in 2010 and strengthening competition in the financial
industry, the IMF said.  Economic output continued to increase, boosted by tourism,
and inflation remained low as international food and oil prices
haven’t yet passed through to domestic prices, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
