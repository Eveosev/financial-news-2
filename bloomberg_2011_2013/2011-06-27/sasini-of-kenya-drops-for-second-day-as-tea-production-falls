Sasini Ltd. (STCL) , a Kenyan tea and coffee
grower, erased an earlier decline caused by a report that showed
production of the tea leaves in the East African nation fell 7
percent in the year through May.  The stock was unchanged at 11:35 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Nairobi, after retreating as much as 0.9
percent.  Tea output in  Kenya , the world’s biggest exporter of the
black variety, decreased to 32.8 million kilograms (72.3 million
pounds) in May from a year earlier due to a “depressed and
poorly distributed rainfall pattern experienced in most tea-
growing areas,” James Finlay (Mombasa) Ltd., a tea broker, said
in an e-mailed report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
