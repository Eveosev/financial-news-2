Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  is being
“massively undervalued” by investors, and its stock will
recover as earnings outpace costs linked to troubled home loans,
said Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC.  “Under the bleakest of scenarios Bank of America’s book
value will rise in the next three years,” Bove, who is based in
Lutz,  Florida , wrote today in a note to clients. “At some point
the market will adjust to the company’s real values.”  Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by assets, has
slid 19 percent in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
this year amid mortgage writedowns and legal costs tied to the
nation’s housing slump. Shares of the  Charlotte , North Carolina-
based bank climbed 33 cents to $10.85 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading after international regulators
announced planned  capital requirements  that eased concerns that
rules would be more stringent.  “For longer-term investors willing to accept less than
desirable returns near-term, Bank of America is a very, very
undervalued stock,” Bove said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
