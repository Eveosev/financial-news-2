(Corrects type of crude in third paragraph.)  Angola  will reduce daily crude
exports by 4.7 percent in August from a month earlier, according
to a final loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Africaâ€™s second-largest oil producer plans to ship 50
million barrels, or 1.61 million barrels a day, in August,
compared with 52.5 million, or 1.69 million barrels a day in
July, the program showed. The number of shipments planned will
total 52 in August versus 55 a month earlier.  The country will ship nine cargoes of Dalia crude in August,
one more than the provisional schedule, while exports for other
grades are unchanged from originally planned.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  Details of the program are as follows. Cargo size is in
1,000 barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
