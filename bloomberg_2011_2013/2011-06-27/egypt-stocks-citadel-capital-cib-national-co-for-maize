Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 1.2 percent, the most in more than three weeks, to
5,375.73 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo.  The following shares rose or fell in Cairo. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Citadel Capital SAE (CCAP EY) rose for the first time in
three days, advancing as much as 2.7 percent before closing 0.9
percent higher at 5.91 Egyptian pounds. The private equity firm
will sign an agreement on June 28 for $21 million with the
 European Investment Bank  and Germany’s DEG. The money will go to
a fund that controls Citadel’s river transport investments in
Egypt.  Commercial International Bank Egypt SAE (COMI)   lost 2.8
percent to 28.88 pounds, the lowest level since May 12. Egypt’s
Finance Minister said June 25 the country does not need to
borrow from the  International Monetary Fund  and  World Bank  “at
the moment.”  “The assumption was made by the market in May that the
government’s success in obtaining international and bilateral
aid packages would improve the fiscal outlook, which was
reflected positively on banking stocks,” said Dubai-based Ryan
Ayache, a banking analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. “Banks tend to
be the most sensitive to macroeconomic developments.”
Commercial Bank jumped 16 percent in May.  National Co. for Maize Products (NCMP EY) gained 2 percent,
the most in more than two weeks, to 17.01 pounds. The Cairo-
based milling plant said it is seeking to buy land from the
government for a project with a foreign investor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
