Ethanol futures slipped to a three-
week low in  Chicago  as favorable weather in the U.S. Midwest
reduced the cost of producing the fuel from corn.  The grain-based biofuel dropped for a fourth day as warm,
wet weather conducive to crop development blanketed the Midwest,
lowering corn prices. Ethanol is made mostly from the grain in
the U.S.  “Ethanol’s healthy, it’s doing well,” said Justin Dirico,
senior ethanol trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “Corn
is continuing its losing trend as the weather outlook remains
good for growing. A lot of producers are selling.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 2.3 cents, or
0.9 percent, to settle at $2.61 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since June 6. Futures have fallen four
consecutive days in the longest such streak since April 15.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 10.5
cents, or 4 percent, to $2.60 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive plunged 10 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $2.70, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the  Gulf Coast  dipped 7 cents, or 2.5 percent,
to $2.725 a gallon and on the West Coast fell 3 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.785.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 5.25 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $6.2675 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel can make
at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
