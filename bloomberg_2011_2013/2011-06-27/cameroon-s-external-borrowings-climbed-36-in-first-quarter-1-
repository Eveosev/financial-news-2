Cameroon borrowed 23.6 billion CFA
francs ($51.1 million) from abroad in the first quarter, 36
percent more than a year earlier, according to Finance Minister
Essimi Menye.  The cost of servicing the debt climbed 12.7 percent to 11.5
billion over the same period, Menye said in a statement handed
to reporters today in the capital, Yaounde. He didn’t give a
figure for the outstanding debt.  The cost of serving domestic debt rose to 55.6 billion CFA
francs from 45.3 billion, Menye said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
