U.S. stock index futures maintained
gains, indicating the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index may end its
three-day losing streak, after  consumer spending  unexpectedly
stagnated in May.  S&P 500 futures expiring in September climbed 0.2 percent
to 1,265.90 at 8:31 a.m. in  New York .  Purchases were little changed, the weakest outcome since
June 2010, after a revised 0.3 percent gain the prior month that
was smaller than previously estimated, U.S. Commerce Department
figures showed today. The median of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a 0.1 percent gain. Prices excluding
food and energy rose more than forecast.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
