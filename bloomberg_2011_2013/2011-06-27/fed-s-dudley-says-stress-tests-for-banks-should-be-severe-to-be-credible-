Federal Reserve Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said so-called bank stress tests
must use scenarios that are “severe” in order to be
“credible,” and disclosure of the results must be
“sufficiently granular” so that they can be readily analyzed.  U.S. regulators have found stress-tests “useful in
identifying best practices and to determine where particular
banks were deficient,” Dudley said in the text of remarks
delivered in Bern,  Switzerland  on May 28, which were released
today. He said his remarks were intended to be “of interest”
to European regulators.  The results of the stress tests must also be “credible in
terms of expected losses,” and “there needs to be a credible
capital backstop so that market participants can be sure banks
will be able to raise the capital that they need under a stress
environment,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
