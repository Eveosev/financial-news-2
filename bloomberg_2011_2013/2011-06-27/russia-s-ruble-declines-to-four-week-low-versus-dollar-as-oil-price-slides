The ruble slid to its weakest
against the dollar in a month as oil, Russia’s chief export
earner, dropped on speculation the  International Energy Agency 
may release more of its stockpiles to steady prices.  The ruble lost 0.6 percent to 28.33 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest since May 25. The Russian
currency was down 0.2 percent at 40.2 per euro, leaving it 0.4
percent weaker at 33.6715 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket, its lowest level in two months based on
closing prices.  The IEA will act again if needed after announcing its third
release of emergency stockpiles since its creation in 1974 last
week, aimed at stabilizing prices as the war in Libya chokes
global crude supplies, Executive Director  Nobuo Tanaka  said in
Beijing June 25. Crude for August delivery dropped as much as
$1.34 a barrel today, and last traded down 1 percent at $90.22 a
barrel.  “The oil and  Russia  relationship remains close,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist and head of research for Russia at ING
Groep NV in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note June 25.  Oil
prices  “will again be one of the major factors determining
Moscow’s bourses and the ruble,” he wrote.  Crude prices slipped 15 percent in the three months after
the IEA last released emergency supplies in September 2005. The
agency released stockpiles after  Hurricane Katrina  knocked out
10 percent of U.S. refining capacity.  Russian government dollar bonds due 2015 fell, pushing the
yield up eight basis points to 2.996 percent. The country’s
ruble Eurobond yielded two basis points more at 7.021 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards, which allow companies to hedge
against currency movements, show the ruble at 28.6088 per dollar
in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
