AGL Energy Ltd. (AGK) , the Australian
electricity retailer, sold its 67.2-megawatt wind park in
Victoria state to an unidentified investor and will continue to
develop the project until completion in early 2012.  The Melbourne-based utility will recoup the approximately
A$164 million ($171 million) it has spent and will receive a
A$38 million development fee to complete the Oaklands Hill Wind
Farm in Victoria state power station south of Glenthompson, it
said today in a statement.  Utilities in Australia and  Europe  are recycling investments
in renewable-energy assets and keeping the electricity for their
own use to help fund new projects while meeting emissions goals.
AGL will operate and maintain the project and buy all of the
electricity produced at prices that are pegged to the wind’s
strength, it said.  “The payments made by AGL under the off-take arrangements
will reflect a sharing of the risks associated with the wind
speed variability at the site,” AGL said.  The utility will retain until 2036 the rights to all
renewable energy certificates from the wind farm, according to
the statement sent to the Australian Stock Exchange.  The development fee will be received from the Australian
buyer when construction is completed with about A$30 million to
be paid in the financial year 2011 and the balance in 2012.  The project, currently under construction by Suzlon Energy
Ltd., is scheduled to be completed in early 2012. The buyer will
fund all remaining development and construction costs, AGL said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
