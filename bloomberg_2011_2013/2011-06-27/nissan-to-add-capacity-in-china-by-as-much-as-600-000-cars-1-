Nissan Motor Co. plans to boost
production capacity in  China  by as much as 600,000 vehicles over
the next six years as Japan’s second-largest automaker expands
in the world’s biggest auto market.  China and  North America  are also the “two main
contenders” as possible locations for a plant to produce
Nissan’s luxury Infiniti brand vehicles, Chief Executive Officer
 Carlos Ghosn  said in an interview in Yokohama yesterday.  “We are envisioning breaking the monopoly of Infiniti
being made in Japan,” Ghosn said. “Infiniti is going to grow,
and we cannot depend on one currency for a brand that is
global.”  The automaker plans to boost sales in emerging economies
and to capture a larger share of the high-margin luxury-car
market as growth slows in  Japan . Nissan aims to increase its
share of the global car market to 8 percent over the next six
years from 5.8 percent last fiscal year as the company expands
in fast-growing markets such as China, it said in a midterm plan
yesterday.  Nissan is targeting a 10 percent share of the Chinese
market by fiscal 2016, compared with 6.2 percent now, it said.  The automaker’s new plant in  Brazil , which will have
capacity to build 200,000 vehicles a year, is expected to begin
production by the end of 2013, Ghosn said. The carmaker aims to
expand its market share in the South American nation to 5
percent from 1.2 percent now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
