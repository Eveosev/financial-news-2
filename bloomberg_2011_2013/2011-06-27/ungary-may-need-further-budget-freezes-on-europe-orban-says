Hungary may need to freeze some
budget funds as  Europe â€™s economy is in "very serious trouble"
and western economies will probably stagnate or slump, Prime
Minister  Viktor Orban  said today.  Orban in February approved the freeze of 250 billion forint
($1.3 billion) of budget funds to protect fiscal stability. The
government is proposing to permanently cancel funds from budget
spending, Orban told parliament today.  "When talking about the state of the European economy, the
only thing that gives reason for optimism is the fact that we
are fighting assiduously," said Orban, who is handing over the
rotating presidency of the European Union to Poland this week.
"The situation is more than worrisome."  The most likely trajectories for western economies are an
"L-shaped" stagnation or a "W-shaped" return to recession that
may be deeper than the previous one, Orban added when explaining
why the government may ask to increase budget reserves.  Hungary , which received a 20 billion-euro ($28 billion)
bailout led by the  International Monetary Fund  in 2008, is
planning to finance itself from the market in the future, Orban
said.  Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
