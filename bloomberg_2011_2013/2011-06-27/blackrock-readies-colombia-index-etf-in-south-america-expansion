BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  is preparing to start
a local exchange-traded fund in Colombia as the world’s largest
money manager expands its operations in  South America .  The fund will be denominated in Colombian pesos and will
track the Colcap Index, said Axel Christensen, BlackRock’s
managing director for South America excluding Brazil.  “We’re very close to starting a product in Colombia,” he
said in an interview from London during a Chilean investment
promotion event. “We are days away, we hope.”  IShares, the ETF fund business of New York-based BlackRock,
also plans to start a local fund in Chile after regulatory
changes that enable ETFs take effect next month, Christensen
said. IShares already has local ETFs in Mexico and  Brazil , Latin
America’s two largest markets.  ETFs issue a fixed number of shares and trade throughout
the day like stocks. Most are designed to passively track a
benchmark equity index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
