The euro snapped three-day slumps
against the dollar and the yen amid optimism  Greece ’s parliament
will approve austerity measures to help avert the currency
bloc’s first default.  The shared currency rose versus the majority of its most-
traded peers as the German government welcomed proposals from
French lenders on voluntary participation in a roll-over of
Greek debt. Stocks rose.  New Zealand ’s dollar was the biggest
loser against the euro as the nation’s trade surplus narrowed.  “ France  and  Germany  are giving people confidence,” said
 Brian Taylor , chief currency trader a Manufacturers & Traders
Trust in Buffalo, New York. “The optimism in the equity market
today is helping the euro, and people are feeling good that a
deal might be struck. We are not buying it because we’re not
confident enough yet in what we’re hearing.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.4287 at 5 p.m. in  New
York , from $1.4188 on June 24. It climbed 1.3 percent to 115.58
yen, from 114.13. The dollar appreciated 0.6 percent against the
Japanese currency to 80.89 yen, from 80.43.  “We will be capped on this present move at $1.4325,”
Taylor said.  The Swiss franc, which reached a record high 1.1806 per
euro last week amid investor concern Greek lawmakers would be
unable to pass the austerity plan, fell for the first time in
four days. It declined 0.9 percent to 1.1932 per euro.  Greek lawmakers are starting debate today on the five-year,
78 billion-euro ($111 billion) package of budget cuts and asset
sales that officials say is needed to receive a loan payment and
future financing from the European Union and the  International
Monetary Fund .  ‘Institutional Desire’  “There is a tremendous amount of institutional desire not
to see Greece default, and that is what the market is beginning
to understand,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at
the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “As difficult
as it may be, the Greek parliament will pass the austerity
measures and the market is breathing a sigh of relief.”  Greek creditors may be headed toward an agreement to roll
over 70 percent of their bonds into longer-maturity debt to
prevent a default. France proposed the 70 percent target after
talks last week with banks. German Finance Ministry spokesman
Martin Kreienbaum said in Berlin his government welcomes
proposals from the private sector. Talks with German financial
institutions are proceeding, he said.  German and French lenders are the biggest European holders
of Greek debt. European banks hold 17.2 billion euros of Greek
bonds maturing by the end of 2013, Citigroup Inc. estimated in a
June 23 report.  Gained for Month  The euro gained 1 percent over the past month in the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track the currency
against those of nine other developed nations. The dollar
advanced 1.3 percent.  The greenback extended losses versus the euro as stocks
rose after global regulators announced rules to safeguard the
world’s financial system. They said banks deemed too big to fail
must hold as much as 2.5 percentage points in additional capital
as part of efforts to prevent another financial crisis.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, fell 0.5 percent
to 75.313. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.9 percent.  U.S. consumer purchases stalled in May, the weakest outcome
since June 2010, after a revised 0.3 percent gain the prior
month that was smaller than previously estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed today in  Washington .  U.K. Business  The pound strengthened against the yen after the Lloyds TSB
Business Barometer index for business activity in the next 12
months rose to 46 in June, the highest since May last year,
while a Lloyds index for current economic optimism increased to
36 from 14.  The pound appreciated 0.8 percent to 129.36 yen and rose
0.2 percent versus the dollar to $1.5990.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slumped after a
report showed the trade surplus narrowed in May more than
forecast. The currency fell 0.7 percent to 80.58 U.S. cents. The
kiwi earlier touched 80.09 cents, the weakest since June 16. It
declined 0.2 percent to 65.19 yen.  The nation’s  trade surplus  was NZ$605 million ($485
million) in May, the statistics office said in Wellington,
compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists for a NZ$1 billion surplus.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of raw materials
fell 0.4 percent in its fourth consecutive day of losses, the
longest losing streak in more than a month.  Canada ’s dollar rose from a three-month low against the
dollar as stocks advanced. It earlier touched the weakest level
in more than three months after futures traders reduced bets the
 Bank of Canada  will raise  interest rates  in 2011.  The Canadian currency gained 0.2 percent to 98.65 cents per
 U.S. dollar  after earlier depreciating as much as 0.3 percent to
99.13 cents, the weakest level since March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
