Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  fell to a seven-
month low in London trading after saying it plans to abandon an
unsuccessful exploration well in  Indonesia .  Premier Oil slid as much as 4.4 percent to 431.8 pence, the
lowest since November, before trading at 437.9 pence as of 9:30
a.m. local time.  Although oil and gas shows were found at the Gajah Laut
Utara-1 well on the Tuna block, the results indicated the
“majority of these Oligocene sandstones are tight,” the
company said today in a statement.  The Ocean General rig will now move to drill the Belut
prospect, which is located about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north-
west of Gajah Laut Utara.  Separately, Premier said it started to drill a sidetrack at
its Grosbeak 35/12-4 S well in Norway, which is due to be
completed by the end of July.  In  Pakistan , the K-27 exploration well at the Kadanwari
block was successful and  Eni SpA (ENI) , the project operator, plans to
start gas production from the field by the end of the third
quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
