The additional yield investors
demand to hold Greek bonds instead of German debt may drop by
almost a third because the premium has risen too fast,  Daiwa
Securities  Capital Markets Co. said, citing trading patterns.  Greece’s 10-year yields touched a euro-era record 18.35
percent on June 17 on concern Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
will be unable to win parliamentary passage of a new austerity
plan. The extra yield on Greece’s 10-year debt over German bunds
reached 15.03 percentage points on June 16, the most since the
euro’s debut in 1999, before falling to 13.92 points yesterday.  The premium climbed this month above the top of a so-called
ascending channel that extends from May 2010, signaling it may
have reached “excessive levels,” said Eiji Kinouchi, chief
technical analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. The top line of
an ascending channel suggests the upper limit of a level.  The widening of the  yield spread  tends to pause after the
end of each quarter, suggesting the recent expansion may ease
after this month ends, Kinouchi said. The gap may eventually
narrow to 9.5 percentage points, the bottom of the ascending
channel, according to Kinouchi.  Papandreou will seek parliament’s approval this week for a
78 billion-euro ($111 billion) package of budget cuts and asset
sales, a condition for more aid from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
