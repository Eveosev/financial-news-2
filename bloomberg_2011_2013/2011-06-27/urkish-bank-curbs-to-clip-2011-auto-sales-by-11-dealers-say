Turkish car sales will be almost 11
percent lower than estimated this year after the country’s
central bank moved to curb domestic demand and narrow the  trade
gap , according to the  Oyder  automobile dealers’ association.  Car and van demand will total about 850,000 units, 100,000
lower than previously forecast, Oyder said in an e-mailed
statement. The revised figure would still represent a 12 percent
increases on sales that totaled 760,000 in 2010, it said.  Turkey has increased the  reserve requirements  that
individual banks must keep at the central bank, leaving them
with less room to lend, while the banking regulator on June 18
lifted levies against lenders with consumer loans exceeding 20
percent of their total portfolio to 4 percent from 1 percent.  Turkish car and van sales will total about 80,000 this
month before declining in July and August, the association said
in its statement on June 25. The fasting month of Ramadan,
during which economic activity slows, falls in August this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
