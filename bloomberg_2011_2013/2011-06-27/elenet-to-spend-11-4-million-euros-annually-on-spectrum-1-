Telenet Group Holding NV (TNET) , the
Belgian cable operator controlled by  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) , said
it will acquire wireless spectrum at an average cost of 11.4
million euros ($16.2 million) a year through 2020 to expand in
mobile-Internet services.  Telenet and Tecteo, the municipal holding company that owns
cable operator Voo, will jointly buy  Belgium ’s fourth so-called
3G wireless license for the minimum bid price of 71.5 million
euros, Mechelen, Belgium-based Telenet said in a  statement 
today. Telenet and Tecteo also plan to pay 31.5 million euros
for additional 2G spectrum from November 2015 to March 2021.  Telenet, which currently uses  Mobistar SA (MOBB) ’s network for its
wireless-telephony offering, will seek “more intense”
partnerships with existing owners of mobile networks in Belgium
to share telephony masts and avoid  capital spending  on the
network roll-out. The cable-TV company was the first mobile
operator to start subsidizing smartphones in Belgium in 2009 to
gain subscribers and reverse a slowdown in revenue growth.  “Owning mobile frequency spectrum acts as an insurance
policy against future capacity constraints on existing mobile
networks,” Telenet said in the statement. “The acquired
spectrum can be partially or fully traded under certain
conditions, lowering the overall risk of the investment.”  Telenet said the purchase price will be paid in annual
installments, forecasting a cost of about 8 million euros a year
through 2014, which will increase to about 13.8 million euros
annually in the six years through 2020 because of the additional
2G spectrum to be bought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
