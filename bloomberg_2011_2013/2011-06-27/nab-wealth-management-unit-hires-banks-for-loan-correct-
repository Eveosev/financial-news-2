National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) â€™s
wealth management unit hired Bank of China Ltd., Chinatrust
Commercial Bank and Mega International Commercial Bank Co. to
help it organize a A$200 million ($208.7 million), three-year
 term loan , according to an e-mailed statement.  The facility offers a margin of 120 basis points more than
the bank-bill swap rate, the National Australia Bank statement
said. NAB will also help arrange the loan, it said.  Banks contributing A$25 million or more will receive margin
and fees for a so-called all-in price of 150 basis points over
the swap rate, the statement said.  Meetings to market the facility to other lenders will be
held in Taipei on July 4 and  Singapore  on July 5, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
