Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators climbed for the first time in six
days as shipments to  Texas  gained the most in almost eight
weeks.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to power plants in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments rose 10 percent to 17.7 million
dekatherms (17.3 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Shipments to a region that includes most of Texas
gained 23 percent to 1.85 million dekatherms, the biggest one-
day increase since May 7.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 14.5 percent
to 22.2 million dekatherms.  The high temperature in Austin, Texas, today may be 103
degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Wholesale gas at the Katy hub near Houston rose 5.98 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $4.3094 per million British thermal units as
of 2:18 p.m. on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
advanced 5.52 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.2502 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
