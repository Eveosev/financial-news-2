A Jean-Michel Basquiat self-portrait
sold last night as  London  started a week of contemporary-art
events that include evening auctions with a top estimate of 200
million pounds ($320 million) and the  Masterpiece  fair.  The Basquiat, dating from 1985 and featuring a half-length
self-portrait next to a wooden panel covered in bottle tops,
fetched 2.1 million pounds ($3.4 million) at Phillips de Pury &
Co.’s first contemporary sale at Claridge’s in Mayfair. The
price was five times the $647,500 it fetched at Phillips de
Pury, New York, in 2003.  Auction houses are optimistic about this latest round of
offerings after dealers reported many sales in the $200,000 to
$2 million-range this month at  Art Basel ,  Switzerland , showing a
return to 2007 levels of demand. Phillips also hoped to benefit
by its sale location: its Victoria base has proved too remote
for some collectors, dealers said.  “Claridge’s is a prestigious venue with better access,’’
 New York  dealer Christophe van de Weghe said. “It’s intimate,
which makes people bid more. And the market has improved.’’  The 31-lot sale in Claridge’s ballroom, attended by 200
people, came after Phillips leased a 750-square-foot (69 square
meter) gallery in the Art Deco hotel’s Brook Street frontage.  The Basquiat was one of five works with minimum bids by
third party guarantors. It fell to the guarantor, bidding by
phone, for slightly more than the 2-million-pound low estimate.  Success Rate  The sale raised 11.2 million pounds with fees, against an
estimate of 10 million pounds to 14.5 million pounds, based on
hammer prices. Eighty-seven percent of the lots sold. The
equivalent event last year made 4 million pounds with a success
rate of 53 percent.  Phillips’s  sale of 269 more affordable works
works today will, however, be offered in Victoria.  Also today, Christie’s International’s evening sale will
include the 1953 Francis Bacon painting “Study for a Portrait,”
estimated at 11 million pounds.  Sotheby’s (BID)  auction the following
evening will include 35 lots from the Duerckheim collection of
German art, which is estimated to raise as much as 47.5 million
pounds in total.  The second annual Masterpiece London fair will preview
tomorrow. The event, showcasing high-end art, antiques and
luxury goods, will take place at the South Grounds, Royal
Hospital, Chelsea.  Marlborough Fine Art , Vacheron & Constantin
SA and  Rolls-Royce Motor Cars  will be among the 150 exhibitors.  Bidding remained measured at Phillips, with buyers
reluctant to spend more than $2 million.  Mark Tansey’s  1994
painting “Library (of Babylon),’’ a 16-foot-wide canvas
featuring Piranesi-style prison scenes, was another guaranteed
work. It sold for a low-estimate 1.2 million pounds, and like
the Basquiat, it fell to the guarantor’s telephone bid.  In a sign of growing demand for South American art, a phone
bidder paid a record 713,250 pounds for the flowery 2002
abstract “O Moderno’’ by Brazilian painter Beatriz Milhazes.  New York collector Jose Mugrabi paid 690,850 pounds, near
the low estimate, for the 2008 Damien Hirst butterfly painting
“Confession.’’  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
