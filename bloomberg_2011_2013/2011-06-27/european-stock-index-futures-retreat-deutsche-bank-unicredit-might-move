European stocks closed little
changed as Greek lawmakers debated austerity measures needed to
secure more aid and stave off default.  Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG)  soared 8 percent after  Cheung
Kong  Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. said it may make a takeover
offer for the U.K. utility. Niscayah AB jumped to a three-year
high after agreeing to be bought by Stanley Black & Decker Inc.
 Akzo Nobel NV (AKZA)  sank the most in 16 months after the world’s
biggest paint maker forecast a drop in profit.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced less than 0.1 percent
to 264.01 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London . The gauge has fallen
for eight straight weeks, the longest decline since 1998, as
concern grew that Greece will default on its debt and U.S.
economic data trailed forecasts. The retreat has left the
measure trading at the cheapest valuation compared with reported
profits since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is clearly a lot of value in  Europe  but investors
don’t like value when there is a lot of fear around,” said
 Karen Olney , head of thematic equity strategy at UBS AG in
London. “Everyone thinks there will probably be a default in
Greece, the question is when and how. It’s likely going to be
pushed out to 2013 and beyond.”  Greek Vote  Greek lawmakers are due to vote on a five-year austerity
plan this week that is crucial for the country to secure more
international aid. Failure to pass the plan may lead to the euro
area’s first sovereign default as Greece needs to cover 6.6
billion euros ($9.4 billion) of maturing bonds in August.  The first session of the three-day debate began in  Athens 
today and a vote is expected on June 29. An implementation law,
which provides the technical details of how the five-year plan
will be applied is also due to be discussed and approved by the
deadline of June 30.  National benchmark indexes fell in 11 of the 18 western
European markets.  Germany ’s DAX slipped 0.2 percent while
 France ’s CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose
0.4 percent.  Greece ’s ASE dropped 0.5 percent.  “The chance of the Greeks to pass the vote is high but
it’s not negligible it will go wrong, so the market is really
trading sideways,” said Didier Abbato, a client trading senior
manager at Copenhagen-based Saxo Bank.  Northumbrian Water gained 8 percent to 413.5 pence, the
biggest increase since February 2010, after Cheung Kong said
it’s in the preliminary stages of assessing a possible cash
offer for the company. United Utilities Plc, a rival U.K. water
company, climbed 3.3 percent to 587.5 pence.  Niscayah, Securitas  Niscayah jumped 16 percent to 18.20 kronor after Stanley
Black & Decker agreed to buy the Swedish company for about $1.2
billion to secure expansion in the market for electronic
security systems.  Securitas AB (SECUB) , which last month offered to acquire Niscayah
through a share swap, advanced 1.8 percent to 62 kronor.  Akzo Nobel tumbled 6.5 percent to 42.76 euros, the biggest
drop since February 2010, after the chemical company said
second-quarter results will be hurt by higher raw-material
prices and one-off costs related to factory maintenance.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
will amount to about 550 million euros. That compares with about
614 million euros a year earlier.  Danish Banks Slide  Danske Bank A/S led Danish banks lower as Fjordbank Mors
A/S became the nation’s second regional lender to resort to the
state’s bank resolution package in 2011 after it failed to meet
solvency requirements.  Danske Bank lost 5.2 percent to 88.60 kroner, Jyske Bank
A/S retreated 3.1 percent to 191.5 kroner and Sydbank A/S fell
2.4 percent to 110 kroner.  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC)  surged 5.3 percent to
39.52 pence. Chief Executive Officer Tony Rice bought 2.5
million shares in the phone company at 37.63 pence apiece before
an investor day on July 1.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  fell 1.1 percent to 3,026 pence after the
U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker said patients taking its
experimental diabetes pill had more breast and bladder cancers
than those on a standard drug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
