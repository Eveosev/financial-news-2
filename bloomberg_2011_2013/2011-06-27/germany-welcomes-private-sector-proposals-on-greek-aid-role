The German government welcomed
proposals from French banks and insurers on voluntary
participation in a second Greek aid package.  “The German government welcomes it when proposals come
from the private sector, including those on private-creditor
participation that are now coming out of  France ,” German
Finance Ministry spokesman Martin Kreienbaum told reporters in
Berlin today.  French banks and insurers proposed rolling over 70 percent
of their holdings of Greek debt, President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said,
adding that he hopes other countries will join the proposal.  “The German government is still in talks with financial
institutions, with banks and insurers that are private creditors
for example through investment funds,” Kreienbaum said. “These
talks will obviously also deal with corresponding proposals. But
in general, it’s extremely welcome that the private sector has
itself come up with suggestions so that we can come to a
solution.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
