Old Republic International Corp. (ORI)  had
mortgage insurance subsidiaries downgraded by  Standard & Poor’s 
as the units lose market share.  The ratings were cut to BB+ from BBB- on “diminished
business and capital position, currently weak earnings and poor
earnings prospects,” S&P said today in a statement on the
businesses at Chicago-based Old Republic. “Declining market
share combined with the continuing unfavorable mortgage lending
climate has also weakened the company’s competitive position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
