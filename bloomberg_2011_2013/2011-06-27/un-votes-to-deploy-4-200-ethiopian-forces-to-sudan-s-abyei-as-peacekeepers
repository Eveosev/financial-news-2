The  United Nations   Security Council 
voted 15-0 today to deploy 4,200 Ethiopian soldiers to the
Sudanese region of Abyei, a peacekeeping mission that will allow
the withdrawal of forces of northern and  Southern Sudan .  Northern and Southern Sudan agreed on June 20 to withdraw
their troops from the disputed border region. Sudan’s army
seized the main town in Abyei on May 21 after accusing Southern
Sudan’s security forces of attacking its forces.  The south is due to become independent on July 9. Fighting
in Abyei and the northern Sudanese border state of Southern
Kordofan has raised concern of a return to the two-decade civil
war in sub-Saharan  Africa ’s third-biggest oil producer that
ended in 2005.  The draft resolution creates a UN Interim Security Force
for Abyei for a period of six months, with a mandate that
includes providing security for oil facilities in the area
“when necessary and in cooperation with the Abyei Police
Service.” The Ethiopians would also “monitor and verify” the
withdrawal of the northern and Southern Sudanese forces and
facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.  Since the Sudanese army’s occupation of Abyei, about
113,000 people have fled their homes, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
