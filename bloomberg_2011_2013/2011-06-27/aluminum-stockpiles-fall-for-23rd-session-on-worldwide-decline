Aluminum inventories tracked by the
 London  Metal Exchange dropped for a 23rd session, declining in
warehouses around the world.  Stockpiles of the lightweight metal fell 11,475 metric tons
to 4.53 million tons, daily exchange figures showed. That was
the lowest level since Feb. 4. Declines were registered in
warehouses from  Detroit  to  Singapore . Inventories are down 3.8
percent since rising to a record 4.71 million tons on May 18.  Canceled warrants, or orders to draw aluminum from LME
stocks, fell 11,475 tons to 461,725 tons. They jumped 71 percent
in the four weeks through June 10 and reached the highest level
since at least October 1997 on June 6.  The increase was “the result of the breakdown in the
profitability of the carry trade throughout May,” said Angus Staines, an analyst at UBS AG in London. “My calculations
suggest that it was not profitable to roll the carry trade
during most of May,” he said June 24.  Lead inventories rose 750 tons to 322,500 tons, while
canceled warrants increased 2,875 tons, or 7.9 percent, to
39,250 tons on a gain in Port Klang,  Malaysia . Zinc stockpiles
fell 475 tons to 866,750 tons and canceled warrants declined 375
tons to 48,850 tons.  Copper inventories dropped for a third day, falling 3,175
tons to 470,525 tons. Canceled warrants declined 4,750 tons to
29,350 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
