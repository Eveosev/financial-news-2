Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL) , a Nigerian lender
bailed out by the central bank two years ago, advanced to its
highest in more than three weeks after a court dismissed a bid
to halt its sale to  First City Monument Bank Plc. (FCMB)   The stock gained 2 kobo, or 3.6 percent, to 57 kobo by 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos, the highest since June 3.  Federal High Court Justice Okechukwu Okeke said June 24
that the suit filed by Okey Nwosu, a former managing director of
Finbank, amounted to an abuse of court process since a similar
suit has been initiated by the bank’s shareholders.  First City Monument Bank signed a memorandum of
understanding to merge with and recapitalize Finbank, FCMB’s
spokesman Kenny Aliu said May 5. The central bank fired eight
chief executives of  Nigeria ’s 24 banks in 2009 after a debt
crisis, in part resulting from loans to domestic stock
speculators, threatened the country’s banking industry with
collapse. The regulator bailed out the industry with 620 billion
naira ($4 billion). Finbank was one of the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
