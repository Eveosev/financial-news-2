Reyal Urbis SA (REY) ,  Spain ’s fourth-
biggest property company by market value, plans to renegotiate
its debt for the second time in just over a year as the
country’s real-estate market deteriorates.  “With the aim of guaranteeing the stability of the
company’s business in the medium term, Reyal Urbis has decided
to start a new process with lenders to adapt its business plan
and debt to market circumstances,” the Madrid-based company
said today in regulatory filing.  Spanish real estate companies relied on debt to buy rivals
during a decade-long property boom and then struggled to meet
sales targets when the market collapsed. In May 2010, Reyal
Urbis refinanced 4.6 billion euros ($6.5 billion) of loans and
extended the maturity of its syndicated loan to December 2016.    Metrovacesa SA (MVC) , the largest Spanish property developer by
market value, is currently in talks to restructure 5.2 billion
euros of debt. Last month, Spain’s Renta Corporacion Real Estate
SA agreed to a new debt deal with creditors.  Reyal Urbis rose 5 cents, or 5.6 percent to 94 cents as of
2:50 p.m. in Madrid trading, giving the company a market value
of 276 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story: Sharon Smyth in Madrid at
