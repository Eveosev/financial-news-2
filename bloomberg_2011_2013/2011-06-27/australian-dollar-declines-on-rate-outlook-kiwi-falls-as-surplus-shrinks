The Australian dollar fell to a
two-month low versus the greenback as traders added to bets the
 Reserve Bank  will lower  interest rates  as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis slows global growth.  New Zealand’s currency slid against all its major
counterparts after a government report showed the trade surplus
narrowed last month more than economists forecast. Both
currencies also declined as a slump in commodity prices sapped
investor demand for higher-yielding assets.  “That increasing-yield argument that had been supporting
the Aussie dollar has dissipated,” said  Thomas Averill , a
director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency and interest
rate risk management company. “There’s generally a bit of risk
aversion out there.”  Australia’s dollar fell 0.5 percent to $1.0439 at 2:24 p.m.
in  New York , from $1.0491 last week, after dropping to $1.0391,
the lowest level since April 12. The currency rose 0.1 percent
to 84.46 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar declined 0.8 percent to 80.55
U.S. cents and slid 0.2 percent to 65.18 yen.  Benchmark rates are 4.75 percent in Australia and 2.5
percent in New Zealand, compared with as low as zero in the U.S.
and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific nations’
assets. The risk in such trades is that currency market moves
will erase profits.  New Zealand’s dollar fell for a third day versus the
greenback after the government said the trade surplus shrank to
NZ$605 million ($488 million) in May. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast a surplus of NZ$1 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
