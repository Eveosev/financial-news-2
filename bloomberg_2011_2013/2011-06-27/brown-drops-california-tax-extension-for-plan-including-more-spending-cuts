California Governor  Jerry Brown  said
he dropped his plan to extend expiring taxes to close a $10
billion budget deficit and will back a new proposal based on $4
billion in higher-than-forecast revenue and additional spending
cuts.  The agreement requires only a simple majority to pass the
Democratic-controlled Legislature, meaning Brown doesn’t need
Republican cooperation to adopt the spending plan for the year
beginning July 1.  Brown, a 73-year-old Democrat, took office in January on a
pledge to fix the fiscal malfunctions that have left California
with the lowest credit rating of any state from  Standard &
Poor’s . The governor spoke in a news conference in Sacramento.  The Golden State, which accounts for 13 percent of the U.S.
gross domestic product, began the year with a $26 billion
deficit. Since then, spending cuts approved in March and better-
than-projected tax revenue shrank the gap to $10 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
