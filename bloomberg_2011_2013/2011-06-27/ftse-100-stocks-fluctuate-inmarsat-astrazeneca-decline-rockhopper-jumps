U.K. stocks advanced before Greek
lawmakers meet to debate austerity measures that the European
Union has made a condition of providing further aid to the
indebted country.  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  dropped 1.1 percent as Citigroup Inc.
downgraded its recommendation on the shares.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) 
retreated 0.9 percent as the company and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. said patients taking their experimental diabetes pill had
more breast and bladder cancers than people using a standard
drug.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 0.3 percent to 5,714.29
at 10 a.m. in London. The FTSE All-Share Index also gained 0.3
percent, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.1 percent.  U.K. stocks fell last week, the gauge’s fifth straight week
of losses, as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke cut
his growth forecast for the world’s largest economy. Since its
peak this year on Feb. 8, the FTSE 100 has tumbled 6.2 percent
as U.S. economic data trailed forecasts and concern mounted that
 Greece  will default on its debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
