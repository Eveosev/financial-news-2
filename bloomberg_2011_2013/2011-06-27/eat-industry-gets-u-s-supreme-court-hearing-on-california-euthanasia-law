The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
hear a meat industry trade group’s challenge to a  California  law
that requires slaughterhouses to immediately euthanize animals
that are too sick to stand up.  The justices today granted an appeal by the National Meat
Association, which argues that U.S. meat-safety law bars
California from imposing its requirements on federally inspected
slaughterhouses.  The state law was enacted in 2008 after the  Humane Society 
of the United States released a video of so-called downer cows
being kicked, electrocuted, dragged with chains and rammed with
a forklift at a Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. slaughterhouse.  The California law bans slaughterhouses from buying or
selling downer cows and from butchering them for human
consumption. The measure also requires humane handling of the
animals.  A San Francisco-based federal appeals court refused to
grant a preliminary injunction blocking the law. Although the
court said the humane-handling provision probably was pre-empted
by federal law, the three-judge panel declined to block it,
saying the trade group hadn’t shown its members would suffer
“irreparable injury.”  The case is National Meat Association v. Harris, 10-224.  To contact the reporter on this story:
