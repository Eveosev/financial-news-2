Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  agreed
to sell its stake in Manhattan’s  200 Fifth Ave. , the former
International Toy Center, to a real estate fund run by JPMorgan
Asset Management, two people with knowledge of the deal said.  The fund paid about $700 million for Lehman’s majority
interest, said the people, who asked not to be named because
details of the transaction are private. The building’s tenants
include Tiffany & Co., which has 260,000 square feet (24,150
square meters) of offices, and Eataly, an Italian food emporium.  Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy almost three years ago,
has been planning real estate sales as values for its properties
increase. Chief Executive Officer  Bryan Marsal  said on Dec. 30
that the firm would bring “some very high-quality assets” to
market in the first half of 2011.  The company, in a partnership with New York-based real
estate investor  L&L Holding Co. , bought 200 Fifth Ave. in 2007
for $480 million, according to property records. L&L, which
manages the 800,000-square-foot building, remains an owner, one
of the people with knowledge of the transaction said.  The Wall Street Journal reported the deal earlier today.  Brokerage Eastdil Secured LLC represented Lehman in the
sale of its stake.  Kimberly Macleod , a Lehman spokeswoman,
declined to comment on the deal, as did Kristen Chambers, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan.  David Levinson , chairman and CEO of
L&L, didn’t return a phone message left at his office.  Lehman, once the fourth-largest investment bank, listed
real estate assets of $23 billion the day before its Sept. 15,
2008, bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history. Its properties
had a market value of about $14 billion nine months later, the
New York-based company said in court papers.  The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
