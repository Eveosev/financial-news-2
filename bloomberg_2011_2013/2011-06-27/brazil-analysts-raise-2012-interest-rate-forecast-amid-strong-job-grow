Brazilian economists cut their 2012
inflation forecasts for the first time since February, a sign
they are more confident that the central bank will succeed in
cooling the economy.  Consumer prices will rise 5.15 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in a June 24  central bank survey  of about
100 economists published today. The figure was down from 5.18
percent the previous week. Prices, as measured by the IPCA
index, will rise 6.16 percent this year, the survey found.
That’s down from 6.18 percent the previous week and 6.37 percent
at the end of April.  “It’s the first time for many months that you see both
2011 and 2012 inflation forecasts going down,” said Enestor  Dos Santos , senior Brazil economist for BBVA in  Madrid . “The market
is putting less pressure on the central bank.”  The central bank raised  interest rates  for a fourth
consecutive meeting this month, raising its benchmark lending
rate a quarter-point to 12.25 percent. In the minutes to the
meeting policy makers said the inflation outlook is “more
favorable” than it was in April, though warned of a risk to
their inflation outlook caused by a tight labor market.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.39 percent at 9:07 a.m.
New York time. The real strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.6017 per
 U.S. dollar   Rates Forecast  In today’s survey economists increased their 2012 interest
rate forecast for the first time in seven weeks. The benchmark
rate will increase to 12.5 percent in July and remain at that
level through the end of 2012, the survey found. A week ago,
economists saw the Selic ending 2012 at 12.25 percent.  Analysts raised their interest rate forecasts on concern
that the government will not be able to rein in spending next
year, leaving the central bank to fight inflation pressure on
its own, according to Dos Santos.  “Everyone is looking at the minimum wage adjustment in
2012,” Dos Santos said. “Economists don’t expect any help from
fiscal policy in 2012.”  The minimum wage is likely to rise more than 13 percent
next year, under a formula that takes into account inflation and
gross domestic product growth from two years prior, when it
expanded at the fastest pace in two decades.  Brazil ’s government
uses the minimum wage to calculate pension payments.  The bank has signaled it may raise rates further this year
to cool inflation that has exceeded the upper limit of the
government’s target range since April.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through mid-
June. The central bank aims to slow inflation back to the 4.5
percent midpoint of its target in 2012.  Economists cut their forecast for 2011 economic growth to
3.95 percent, from 3.96 percent a week earlier, and their 2012
growth forecast was unchanged at 4.1 percent.  Brazil’s unemployment rate fell in May to 6.4 percent, the
lowest ever for the month, from 7.5 percent a year earlier.
Average real wages rose 4 percent from a year ago, and 1.1
percent from April, to 1,567 reais ($983) per month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
