Philippine bonds rose for a second
day on speculation investors are buying the securities ahead of
a debt swap. The peso fell the most in a month.  The bond exchange still needs the approval of President
 Benigno Aquino , which the government expects to get soon,
Treasurer  Roberto Tan  told reporters today. There’s still a
chance the swap will start this week, as earlier targeted, Tan
said. The plan was to offer new 10- and 20-year bonds in
exchange for shorter-maturity notes starting June 28 to early
July, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said on June 21.  “There’s some buying on short to mid-term securities,
those due in three to seven years that are most likely qualified
for the swap,” said Deanno Basas, investment director for fixed
income at ATR KimEng Asset Management Inc. in Manila.  The yield on the 6.25 percent bonds due January 2014 fell
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 4.45 percent as
of 4:05 p.m. local time, the lowest level since May 2, according
to Tradition Financial Services. The peso dropped 0.4 percent to
43.592 per dollar, the biggest decline since May 25, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Government spending  was within target in May and is
“accelerating” compared with previous months, Budget
Undersecretary Laura Pascua said today.  The Bureau of the Treasury spurned bids for 3.5 billion
pesos ($80 million) of 182-day Treasury bills for a second
straight auction, while it allowed one-year borrowing cost to
rise, data from the Bureau of the Treasury showed.  The yield on the 364-day notes climbed to 3.219 percent
from 2.911 percent at the June 13 auction, while the 91-day rate
was almost unchanged at 2.88 percent. The Treasury sold all the
three-month bills on offer and about half of the 4 billion pesos
of one-year notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
