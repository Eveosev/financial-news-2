Police authorities in  Nigeria ,
 Africa ’s biggest oil producer, said a militant Islamic sect
carried out three bomb attacks on bars in the northeastern city
of Maiduguri yesterday that killed at least 25 people.  “No doubt, it is the work of Boko Haram,” Lawal
Abdullahi, the police spokesman in the city, said by phone
today, referring to the sect that draws inspiration from
 Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement. In a separate incident, gunmen
shot dead two people in the city on June 25, including a Muslim
cleric, Abdullahi said.  Authorities in northern Nigeria have blamed the group for a
spate of bomb attacks and killings targeting government
officials and the security forces since last year. The group
claimed responsibility for a blast on June 16 at Nigeria’s
police headquarters in the capital, Abuja, which killed at least
five people and injured 11.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation with more than 140
million people, is roughly split between a mainly Muslim north
and a predominantly Christian south. More than 14,000 people
died in ethnic and religious clashes in the West African nation
between 1999 and 2009, according to the Brussels-based
 International Crisis Group .  To contact the reporter on this story:
