(Corrects date of Prokhorov’s election in second
paragraph.)  President  Dmitry Medvedev  is backing
billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s call to decentralize power in
 Russia  even as other ideas proposed by the billionaire are too
“revolutionary.”  “It’s absolutely obvious that the centralization of power
in any country, even in such a complicated federation as Russia,
can’t continue forever,” Medvedev said at a meeting outside
Moscow with Prokhorov, who was elected chairman of the Pravoye
Delo, or Right Cause, political party on June 25.  Russia’s third-richest man said last week he would be
willing to become prime minister if such a proposition were
made. Prokhorov, the 46-year-old owner of the New Jersey Nets
basketball team, will lead Pravoye Delo, a party with 56,000
members, into December elections for the lower chamber of
parliament.  “At present our country is excessively centralized,”
Prokhorov told the president today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
