Malaysia’s ringgit fell to a one-
week low as concern  Greece ’s debt crisis may worsen eroded
appetite for emerging-market assets.  The currency weakened for a third day before Greek
lawmakers vote on a proposal for budget cuts on June 29 to win a
second round of financial aid. European finance chiefs will
decide on July 3 whether Greece has met conditions for its next
assistance payment. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks
dropped 1.2 percent, its biggest loss since June 16.  Government
bonds  were steady.  “There’s renewed credit stress in the market as people are
in a risk-management mode just in case something bad happens,”
said Sim Moh Siong, a currency strategist at Bank of  Singapore 
Ltd. “While Greece may be able to pass the budget cuts there is
still concern about the debt-restructuring process.”  The ringgit declined 0.5 percent to 3.0605 per dollar as of
4:17 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  and reached 3.0633, the weakest level
since May 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has slipped 1.2 percent this quarter and traders expect
it to drop another 0.5 percent to 3.0757 in three months,
according to non-deliverable forwards contracts.  European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on
June 22 in  Frankfurt  that risk signals for financial stability
in the euro area were flashing “red” as the crisis threatens
to infect banks.  Benchmark three-year bonds were little changed, erasing
earlier losses, as the fastest inflation since March 2009 stoked
concerns the central bank will raise borrowing costs next week.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note due August 2014 held at
3.23 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The rate has climbed
from 3.18 percent on June 10.  Bank Negara  will next meet on July 7 to decide on  interest
rates , after raising it twice to 3 percent in the past 12 months.
Consumer prices rose 3.3 percent in May from a year earlier, the
most since March 2009, government data showed on June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
