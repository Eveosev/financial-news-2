Tanzania plans to offer as much as
15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of land each to sugar investors
to increase output in East Africa’s second-biggest economy.  “We promise between 10,000 and 15,000 hectares of
unencumbered land to each investor,” Agriculture Minister
Jumanne Maghembe said in a statement released today in  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital. The investors are encouraged to
also buy cane from local farmers, Maghembe said. The statement
didn’t give the terms on which the land would be offered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
