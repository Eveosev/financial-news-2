The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
question the conviction of three men, including two former KPMG
LLP executives, for selling illegal tax shelters that helped
wealthy clients save hundreds of millions of dollars.  The justices today turned away appeals from John Larson, a
former KPMG senior manager; Robert Pfaff, a former KPMG partner,
and Raymond Ruble, a former partner at the law firm Brown & Wood
LLP.  The convictions stem from what at one point was the largest
criminal tax case in U.S. history, involving 17 ex-KPMG
executives and two outsiders. The group was accused of costing
the Treasury at least $2 billion in  tax revenue . KPMG admitted
wrongdoing and agreed to pay $456 million to avoid criminal
prosecution in 2005.  Larson was sentenced to 10 years in prison, Pfaff 8 years
and Ruble 6 1/2 years.  The cases are Larson v. United States, 10-1049, and Ruble
v. United States, 10-1061.  To contact the reporter on this story:
