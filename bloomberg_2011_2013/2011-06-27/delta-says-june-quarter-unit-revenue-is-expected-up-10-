Delta Air Lines Inc . may post an
operating margin as high as 7 percent for the three months
through June, even after the earthquake in Japan curbed sales by
$125 million.  The lower end of Delta’s second-quarter operating-margin
forecast was 6.5 percent, as higher sales largely made up for $1
billion in higher  fuel  costs, the Atlanta-based company said
today in a regulatory  filing . Delta, the world’s second-biggest
carrier, said revenue for each seat flown a mile would increase
10 percent.  Delta climbed 23 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $9.66 at 10:25
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The  Bloomberg
U.S. Airlines Index  of 11 carriers gained 1.7 percent. The index
tumbled 4 percent on June 24 after United Continental Holdings
Inc. said revenue growth slowed for the quarter.  Delta is consolidating facilities in its hub cities of
Atlanta, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Memphis to reduce related
costs, and the carrier said it’s trying to find buyers for the
vacant buildings.  Delta may post  earnings  of 57 cents per share, excluding
some items, on sales of $9.16 billion in the quarter, the
averages of estimates from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. A
year ago, Delta reported  adjusted earnings  of 65 cents a share
on sales of $8.17 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
