Evans Analytical Group LLC, the
material-testing and surface-analysis company, is seeking $150
million of loans to refinance existing debt, according to a
person with knowledge of the request.  The financing is split between a five-year, $15 million
revolving line of credit and a six-year, $135 million  term loan ,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the terms
are private.  Both loans have initial price guidance of 5 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate with a 1.5
percent floor on the benchmark, the person said. The loans will
be sold at 99 cents on the dollar.  GE Capital Markets, the lending unit of  General Electric
Co. (GE) , is arranging the transaction for the Sunnyvale, California-
based company. Lenders must let GE know by July 7 whether they
will participate, the person said.  Evans is owned by Odyssey Investment Partners LLC.
Christine Russell, chief financial officer, referred a call to
Odyssey. Randy Paulson, managing principal at Odyssey, didn’t
immediately return a telephone call seeking comment.  In a revolving credit, money can be borrowed again once
it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
