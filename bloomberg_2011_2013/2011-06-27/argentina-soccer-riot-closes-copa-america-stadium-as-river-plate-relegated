A  Buenos Aires  prosecutor ordered
the closure of Argentina’s largest stadium after clashes
yesterday between police and fans injured more than 30 people as
the country prepares to host this week South America’s top
soccer tournament.  The closure of Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires was
ordered after fans of Club Atletico River Plate hurled bleachers
at police and destroyed concessions stands following a match
that saw the team relegated to the second division for the first
time in its 110-year history. River Plate has won 33 Argentine
titles, more than any other team.  The stadium, where Argentina won the 1978  World Cup , was
shut down to allow police to “secure the crime scene and gather
evidence,” prosecutor Gustavo Galante told news channel C5N
today. The facility will remain shuddered as long as the
prosecution requires, Galante said.  Argentina  is seeking to win its first  Copa America , as the
South American soccer tournament is called, since 1993 and
unseat reigning champion  Brazil , which has won four of the last
five titles.  Argentina’s squad includes 24-year-old  Lionel Messi , who
plays for European champion Barcelona and was chosen the world’s
best player in 2009 and 2010. The final of the Copa America is
scheduled for July 24 in the Monumental, which has a capacity to
seat 57,921 people.  River Plate was relegated yesterday after losing a two-
match playoff to Club Atletico Belgrano de Cordoba.  To contact the reporters on this story:
