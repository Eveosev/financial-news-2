Nigeria ’s  Debt Management Office 
expects the country’s borrowing costs to fall after the central
bank lifts a requirement for foreigners to hold local bonds for
at least a year, Director General Abraham Nwankwo said.  “The measure has removed residual restrictions on entry
and exit of non-resident investments in Nigerian securities,”
Nwankwo said in a phone interview yesterday from Abuja, the
capital. “All things being equal, the new rule would moderate
yield downwards,” he said, without providing estimates.  The control will be eliminated on July 1, Central Bank of
Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said on June 23. Africa’s most
populous nation had 4.87 trillion naira ($31 billion) of
outstanding domestic debt as of March 2011, according to the
Debt Management Office.  Bonds rose following Sanusi’s announcement, data compiled
by the  Financial Market Dealers Association  showed. The yield on
the 9.45 percent debt due January 2013 retreated 48 basis
points, or 0.48 percentage point, to 9.87 percent on June 24.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer, plans to sell 852
billion naira of bonds this year, excluding excludes the sale of
bills maturing in less than a year, Nwankwo said. The West
African nation estimates borrowing of 865 billion naira to fund
its  budget deficit  for the fiscal year, which runs through
December, 38 percent less than in 2010, the  finance ministry 
said on Jan. 5.  Lawmakers approved an amended 2011 budget of 4.5 trillion
naira on May 25, which slashes almost 500 billion naira off the
spending plans passed two months earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
