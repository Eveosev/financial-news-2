President  Barack Obama ’s re-election
campaign is asking wealthy supporters to commit to making the
maximum contributions allowed under the law to the president’s
effort and to the  Democratic National Committee .  Donors who pledge $75,800 to the Obama Victory Fund will be
named “Presidential Partners” and will be invited to quarterly
campaign briefings that are sometimes attended by the president,
said a Democratic official who wasn’t authorized to comment
publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.  The program secures two years’ worth of a supporter’s
allowable donations. Presidential Partners contribute $5,000 to
the Obama campaign, $61,600 to the Democratic committee and an
additional $9,200 to a committee that the campaign and the
national committee use in statewide races.  The big-money fundraising program is the latest weapon in a
campaign-financing arms race. It was reported by the Los Angeles
Times. The 2012 election may dwarf previous races with the
campaigns, party committees and independent political groups
projected to raise and spend a combined $2 billion before
Election Day.  “There’s not too much money in politics,” said Mike Duncan, former chairman of the  Republican National Committee  and
current chairman of the independent fundraising group American
Crossroads, which backs Republican candidates.  “It’s a matter of perspective,” he said. “There’s more
money spent each year on Halloween candy and costumes.”  Obama’s campaign is continuing to reach out to small donors
on the Internet. A June 21 e-mail appeal from Vice President  Joe Biden  urged voters to donate $5 or more and get a chance to have
dinner with the president.  The president’s re-election campaign has received 300,000
contributions via the Internet, compared with 180,000 at this
juncture in 2007, said spokesman  Ben LaBolt . The campaign has
set a goal of 450,000 donors by June 30, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
