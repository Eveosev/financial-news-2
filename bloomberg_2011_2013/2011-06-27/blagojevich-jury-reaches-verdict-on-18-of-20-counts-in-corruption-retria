The  Chicago  jury deciding the fate
of former  Illinois  Governor  Rod Blagojevich , standing trial for
the second time on political corruption charges, said it has
reached verdicts on 18 of 20 counts.  “The jury has come to a unanimous decision on 18 of the 20
counts,” the panel of 11 women and one man told U.S. District
Judge James B. Zagel in a note today. Further deliberations were
unlikely to resolve a deadlock on the remaining charges, they
said. The prosecution and defense said they will accept the
partial verdict, which will be announced after 1 p.m. Chicago
time.  The twice-elected Democrat is accused by prosecutors of
attempting to trade official acts, including the appointment of
a U.S. senator to replace  Barack Obama  in 2008, for personal
favors and campaign cash.  Opening statements in the trial were delivered May 2. The
jury began deliberating June 10.  A different jury last year deadlocked on 23 of 24 counts,
convicting Blagojevich, 54, on a single charge of lying to
federal agents about whether he kept track of campaign
contributions.  The case is U.S. v. Blagojevich, 08-cr-00888, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
