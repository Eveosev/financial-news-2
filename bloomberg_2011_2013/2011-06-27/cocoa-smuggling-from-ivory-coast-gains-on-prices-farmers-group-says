Ivory Coast  farmers smuggled as much
as 350,000 metric tons of cocoa into neighboring countries since
Oct. 1 in response to an export ban and higher prices, the head
of a regional farmers’ cooperative said.  The estimate of 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons is based on
truck sightings and reports from other farm groups, Bile Bile,
head of the cooperative in the eastern town of Abengourou and
vice president of the national cocoa farmers union known as
ANAPROCI, said by phone today. The London-based International
Cocoa Organization estimates smuggling reached about 100,000
tons, Executive Director Jean-Marc Anga said May 26.  “Unfortunately, there is no way of controlling it and we
have no reliable statistics of the amount of  cocoa beans  in
question,” said Eric Koffi, the interim operations director of
the National Coffee and Cocoa Management Committee, which
regulates the Ivorian industry.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, relies on
agriculture to provide employment for 68 percent of its  labor
force , according to the CIA World Factbook. Smuggling cuts tax
revenue for the government, which is seeking to stabilize the
nation after a civil war erupted following a disputed
presidential election in November.  President  Alassane Ouattara  ordered a cocoa export ban in
January to cut off funds to former leader  Laurent Gbagbo , who
refused to cede power after losing the vote. The ban ended April
15 after Gbagbo was captured. Cocoa deliveries to ports in  Ivory
Coast  jumped 18 percent in the season to June 19, according to a
document from the Abidjan-based Bourse du Cafe et du Cacao.
Since the start of the season on Oct. 1, deliveries total 1.22
million tons, the data show.  Cocoa Declines  Cocoa fell 22 percent since reaching an eight-month high in
March in  London  trading on forecasts for surplus supply. July-
delivery beans rose 16 pounds ($25.57) to 1,885 pounds per ton
by 3:22 p.m.  Ivory Coast will reap 1.325 million tons in the 12 months
ending in September, 6.7 percent more than a year earlier, the
ICCO forecast in March. Ghana’s harvests will rise 31 percent to
825,000 tons, according to the group, whose members account for
about 85 percent of global cocoa output.  Ghana ’s main-crop harvest reached a record 903,646 tons,
the Ghana Cocoa Board said May 30.  “We’ve got an anti-smuggling  task force  that monitors the
borders, ensuring that cocoa is not smuggled out or into the
country,” Frank Odame, an assistant to the spokesman for the
board, known as Cocobod, said by phone from Accra on June 17.
The jump in output was the result of better farming and improved
prices paid by the board, he said.  Ivorian farmers get 950  CFA francs  ($2.05) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) from Ghanaian buyers and 750 CFA francs from local
traders, said Kouassi N’Guessan, the head of a local farmers’
cooperative in the Ivorian border town of Bettie. He estimated
the smuggling at about 200 tons a day.  Cocoa from Ivory Coast has also “leaked” into Liberia,
Guinea and  Sierra Leone , VM Group and ABN Amro Bank NV said in a
report in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
