Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) ,  Europe ’s
third-largest electronics retailer, said its largest
shareholder, Knight Vinke Asset Management LLC, increased its
holding in the company.  Knight Vinke raised its total stake in Kesa to 19 percent,
Kesa said today in a Regulatory News Service statement. The
asset manager had held 18 percent of the company’s outstanding
shares since March, according to company filings. Knight Vinke
now has 15 percent of London-based Kesa’s voting rights.  Knight Vinke first disclosed a 3 percent stake in Kesa in
June 2010. Kesa has been considering ways to exit its Comet
chain in the U.K. after losses at the unit held back earnings
growth last year. Knight Vinke has asked the company to consider
options including ending Comet’s operations, a person familiar
with the situation said last month.  The activist investor this year questioned plans by
Carrefour SA to list 25 percent of its property unit. The French
retailer later said it would postpone the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
