Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  is the only
Canadian lender with a “reasonable shot” at being classified
as “globally systemically important” by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, Canaccord Genuity analyst Mario Mendonca
said.  The committee has called for increases in bank capital as
governments aim to prevent the need for new taxpayer-funded
bailouts. Lenders deemed too big to fail, or “systemically
important” will be required to hold as much as 2.5 percentage
points in additional capital, the Basel Committee said June 25.  If Canada’s largest bank by assets is classified as such,
it would be near the bottom of the 1 percent to 2.5 percent
range, Mendonca wrote today in a note to clients.  The analyst also said that  Canada ’s banking  regulator  would
be unlikely to treat Toronto-based Royal Bank differently than
the country’s other five main lenders.  Tanis Robinson, a spokeswoman at Royal Bank, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
