Kenneth Heller, a disbarred lawyer
charged with using an offshore  UBS AG (UBSN)  account to hide more than
$26 million from the  Internal Revenue Service , pleaded guilty to
evading taxes.  Heller, 81, pleaded guilty to three counts of personal
income tax evasion from 2006 to 2008 in a hearing today before
U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in  Manhattan .  Heller faces as long as 15 years in prison when he’s
sentenced Sept. 27. He told Castel he has memory loss and needs
a kidney transplant. Based on his health, prosecutors agreed to
recommend a sentence below the 30 to 37 months that both sides
agreed would be called for under federal sentencing guidelines.  “I did not pay the  United States  a substantial amount of
taxes for the calendar years charged in the indictment,”
Heller, reading from a statement, told the judge.  Heller was arrested in April 2010 and charged with evading
more than $2.3 million in federal income taxes. He was one of
seven ex-clients of Zurich-based UBS arrested on the same day
and charged with hiding a total of more than $100 million from
the IRS.  UBS admitted in February 2009 that it helped U.S. clients
evade taxes. The bank avoided prosecution by paying a
$780 million fine and turning over the names of U.S. account
holders to investigators.  As part of a plea agreement, Heller agreed to pay a
$9.8 million penalty to the IRS.  The case is U.S. v. Heller, 10-mg-742, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
