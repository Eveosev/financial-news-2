surged by the 7 percent daily limit to NT$615, the biggest
advance since Nov. 25. The company told analysts on June 24
revenue will improve in June and July from May, said Charlie
Yeh, an analyst at President Securities Corp.  Sino-American
Silicon Products Inc. (5483)  (5483 TT) jumped 6.1 percent to NT$95.30.
 Motech Industries Inc. (6244)  (6244 TT) climbed 5.3 percent to NT$19,
the highest close since April 28.  “The company told the analysts during their company visit
about the better revenue and this led to speculation that the
solar  energy industry  had reached a bottom,” Yeh said in a
telephone interview in Taipei. Gigasolar Chairman Chen Chi-jen
didn’t answer calls to his office.  Compal Communications Inc. (8078)  (8078 TT) surged 6.9 percent to
NT$31.10, the highest close since March 8. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. raised the handset maker’s stock rating to “buy” from
“sell,” saying the company is the “best” contract maker
partner for Nokia OYJ. Nokia’s platform transition will drive a
“significant turnaround” in Compal’s earnings from the fourth
quarter, Goldman said.  Silitech Technology Corp. (3311)  (3311 TT) retreated 1.3 percent
to NT$67.60, the lowest close since July 9, 2009, after the
maker of phone components was cut to “sell” from “neutral”
at Goldman Sachs.  Tatung Co. (2371 TT) jumped 6.7 percent to NT$12.70, the
biggest advance since Dec. 1, after the China Times reported on

price to exceed NT$80 when the company reaches its 100th year
anniversary. The company was established in 1918. Lung-chieh
Wang, spokesman for the company, wasn’t immediately available at
