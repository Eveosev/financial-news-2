The Bovespa stock index advanced,
rebounding from a two-day drop, after economists reduced their
inflation forecasts for 2012 and a report showed consumer prices
declined more than forecast in June.  Homebuilder Cyrela  Brazil  Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes advanced the most in a month, leading gains by
companies that depend on domestic demand.  EDP - Energias do
Brasil SA (ENBR3)  climbed after saying it plans to raise 748.8 million
reais ($469 million) by selling 19.9 million shares for 37.59
reais each in a secondary offering in Brazil, according to a
statement posted on the website of Brazil’s securities
regulator.  The Bovespa rose 0.3 percent to 61,216.98 at the close of
Sao Paulo trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time after earlier
falling as much as 0.4 percent. Forty stocks climbed on the
index, while 26 fell. The real strengthened 0.6 percent to
1.5949 per  U.S. dollar .  “The latest inflation data suggest that price indexes are
converging to the government’s target,” William Castro Alves,
an analyst at brokerage XP Investimentos, said in a phone
interview.  Brazil’s IPC-S consumer price index declined 0.15 percent
in the month ending June 22, the Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio
Vargas Foundation said today. That compares to a median forecast
of a 0.13 percent drop in a Bloomberg survey of 11 economists.  Consumer Prices  Consumer prices will rise 5.15 percent in 2012, from a
week-earlier forecast of 5.18 percent, according to a June 24
central bank survey of about 100 economists published today.
Policy makers target inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Cyrela gained 3.7 percent to 15.40 reais, the most since
May 20. Energias do Brasil climbed 1.7 percent to 38.75 reais.  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore producer, slid 0.1
percent to 44.04 reais after earlier dropping 0.8 percent. The
Rio de Janeiro-based company cut its annual production target by
10 percent to 469 million metric tons in 2015. Vale previously
targeted 2015 output of 522 million tons, according to an e-mail
statement sent today by the company’s press office.  Brazil Pharma SA slumped 4.9 percent to 16.40 reais. The
pharmacy chain controlled by Banco BTG Pactual SA started
trading in Sao Paulo today after selling shares at 17.25 reais
each in an initial public offering last week.  Petrobras Gains  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s state-controlled oil
company, rose 0.9 percent to 23.08 reais. Petrobras, as the
company is known, is seeking to borrow about $47 billion by 2014
as it develops the Americas’ largest crude discovery in three
decades, Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said today in
 Sao Paulo .  Petrobras is currently revising its five-year, $224 billion
investment plan, which is updated annually, as it develops  oil
fields  in Brazil’s offshore pre-salt region. The company’s Lula
field was the biggest crude find in the Americas since  Mexico ’s
Cantarell in 1976.  Separately, the company discovered natural gas in an
onshore field near an area where Brazil plans to auction
exploration licenses later this year. The gas discovery at the
Ilha Pequena block in the Sergipe Basin hasn’t been declared
commercial yet, the National Petroleum Agency said on its
website.  The Bovespa has lost 16 percent from a November high on
concern quickening inflation may hurt domestic demand, while a
slowdown in global economic growth could cut the appetite for
commodities.  Earnings Estimates  The Bovespa trades at 9.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.8 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 6.2 for  Russia ’s Micex and 14.9 for
 India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 4.7 billion reais in stocks today, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a daily average
this year of 6.5 billion reais, according to data from the
exchange.  Investors pulled 1.48 billion reais from  Latin America ’s
largest equity market in the year through June 8, according to
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
