The pound fell against the euro as a
report showing  house prices  fell for a second month in June
added to signs that the U.K. economic recovery is stalling.  Sterling earlier touched the lowest level against the
dollar since January. The average cost of a home in the U.K.
slipped 0.1 percent in June from May, London-based property
researcher Hometrack Ltd. said in an e-mailed report.  U.K. data “is systematically disappointing at the
moment,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at
Mizuho Financial Group Inc. “We’re still in sterling-selling
mode. That sentiment is yet to run its course.”  The pound depreciated 0.4 percent against the euro to 89.27
pence as of 4:45 p.m. in London. It climbed 0.3 percent to
$1.6004 after touching $1.5914, the weakest since Jan. 31, and
added 0.7 percent to 129.21 yen.  Futures traders reversed their bets that the currency will
gain against the  U.S. dollar . The difference in the number of
wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators on a decline
in the pound compared with those on a gain -- so-called net
shorts -- was 11,360 on June 21, compared with net longs of
11,226 a week earlier, according to figures from the Washington-
based Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The British currency has fallen 7.3 percent in the past 12
months, making it the third-worst performer among 10 major-
economy currencies after the U.S. and Canadian dollars,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  Gilts Underperform  Gilts fell as stocks rose, pushing the 10-year yield up
three basis points to 3.16 percent. The 3.75 percent security
due in September 2020 fell 0.245, or 2.45 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 104.66. Two-year note yields also rose three
basis points, to 0.73 percent. The FTSE 100 Index advanced 0.4
percent, reducing demand for a safe haven.  British  government securities  underperformed their German
counterparts this month, handing investors 0.8 percent compared
with a 1 percent return from German debt, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies.  Year-to-date, gilts beat their European peers, returning
3.3 percent while German bonds advanced 1.1 percent, on bets the
U.K. central bank will keep its benchmark rate at a record low
in coming months while the  European Central Bank  continues to
raise borrowing costs.  While Britain’s inflation rate was 4.5 percent in May, more
than twice the government’s target, the central bank kept its
benchmark rate at a record low 0.5 percent this month and  Bank
of England  Governor  Mervyn King  said on June 16 that weak growth
in wages and money signal the current bout of above-target
inflation will prove temporary.  Ten-year gilt yields will end the year at 3.85 percent,
according to a weighted average of 12 economist forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
