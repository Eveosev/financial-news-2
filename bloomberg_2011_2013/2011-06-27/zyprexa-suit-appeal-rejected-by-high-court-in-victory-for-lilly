The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a bid to press a class-action suit against  Eli Lilly &
Co. (LLY)  over the marketing of Zyprexa, the company’s schizophrenia
treatment.  The justices today turned away an appeal by pension funds,
unions and insurers that claim they spent more for the drug than
it was worth. The plaintiffs say Lilly violated a federal
racketeering law by making fraudulent claims about Zyprexa’s
safety and effectiveness and promoting it for non-approved uses.  The group was seeking $6.8 billion on behalf of thousands
of so-called third-party payors. A federal appeals court said
the case wasn’t appropriate for class-action status and told a
trial judge to consider whether the plaintiffs filing the suit
could press their individual claims.  Indianapolis-based Lilly in 2009 pleaded guilty to
promoting Zyprexa for unapproved uses and agreed to pay $1.4
billion in criminal and civil penalties. Zyprexa is its top-
selling drug.  The case is Sergeants Benevolent Association Health and
Welfare Fund v. Eli Lilly & Co., 10-1173.  To contact the reporter on this story:
