The European Commission is likely to
propose an increase in its revenue-raising powers, including the
introduction of taxes that apply throughout the European Union,
the Financial Times reported, citing officials involved in
drafting the budget that’s due to be presented this week.  The commission will make an “ambitious” proposal, the
newspaper cited Andreas Schwarz, a member of the budget
commissioner’s cabinet, as saying.  A tax on financial transactions or activity is one option
being considered; others include levies on airline tickets and
tapping some revenue from the EU’s emissions-trading system, the
FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
