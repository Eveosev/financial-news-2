Ricoh Co., the Japanese office-
equipment maker, said it erected the world’s first billboard
fueled by wind and solar power.  The 12-by-3-meter (39-by-10-foot) sign is on the U.K.’s M4
motorway linking  London  to Heathrow Airport, said Tom Wagland,
head of the environmental management group at Ricoh’s European
unit. It’ll advertise Tokyo-based Ricoh’s products and follows
the installation last year of a solar-powered board in  New
York ’s Times Square, he said.  “The wind turbines are on top and the solar panels are
mounted on the framework,” Wagland said in a phone interview.
“If the sun’s out, the solar panels will be charging the
battery so it can run at night” for up to 11 hours, he said.  The board will use the same power in a year as 1.4 typical
U.K. homes, according to Ricoh. It was developed by the Japanese
companies Ad Gear Ltd. and Zephyr Corp., it said. Wagland didn’t
immediately have information on who supplied the  wind turbines 
and solar panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
