Commodities fell to a five-month
low, extending two weeks of losses as Greek lawmakers discuss
budget cuts needed to ensure a bailout loan, raising speculation
of slower growth and demand for raw materials.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials fell
0.5 percent to 641.91 by 3:53 p.m. in  London , after earlier
today falling to 635.27, the lowest level since Jan. 28. Cotton
was down as much as 5 percent at $1.1692, the lowest level since
Dec. 1.  Greek lawmakers are debating a 78 billion-euro ($110
billion) austerity package needed before the release of a loan
payment and future financing. The GSCI index is up 1.5 percent
this year.  “Investors are withdrawing funds from commodities as they
are afraid of a slowdown,” said  John Flanagan  , the president
of Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina,  North Carolina .
“People are moving away from riskier assets.”  Money managers cut their net-long positions in 18 U.S.
commodities by 13 percent to 1.13 million futures and options
contracts in the seven-days ended June 21, data from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. That’s the biggest
decline since May 10.  Crude oil for August delivery declined 38 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $90.78 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The most active contract has lost about 12 percent this month
and is heading for its worst performance since May 2010 as the
 International Energy Agency  said it’s prepared to release more
stockpiles to stabilize prices, after a June 23 pledge to inject
2 million barrels a day for 30 days.  IEA Decision  “Leading into the IEA’s decision to release stockpiles, we
had a global economy that was slowing and we already had
concerns over Greece,” said  Jonathan Barratt , managing director
of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.  Silver for September delivery fell 68 cents to $33.95 an
ounce on the Comex in New York. Copper for three-month delivery
declined 3.2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.083 a pound on the
Comex in  New York .  Wheat futures fell 1.5 percent to $6.5125 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures were little changed at
$6.3175 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
