LDK Solar Co., a Chinese
manufacturer of polysilicon wafers and modules, surged in pre-
market trading in  New York  after announcing plans to buy back as
much as $110 million of its American depositary receipts.  LDK gained 39 cents, or 5.7 percent, to $7.20 as of 9:05
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange trading. Before today, the
shares had dropped 33 percent this year.  The repurchase program does not require the company to buy
any shares and may be suspended at any time, LDK said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
