The  Food and Drug Administration 
said it will issue preliminary findings on the health effects of
menthol cigarettes this year after outside advisers review an
internal report starting next month.  The U.S. market for menthol tobacco products is $25 billion
a year, or about 30 percent of cigarette sales, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg Government.  Lorillard Inc. (LO)  of
Greensboro, North Carolina, makes the best-selling brand,
Newport, with sales of $5 billion a year. Marlboro Menthol, made
by Richmond, Virginia-based  Altria Group Inc. (MO)  and the Kool and
Salem brands sold by  Reynolds American Inc. (RAI)  of Winston Salem,
North Carolina, are other leading brands.  The FDA is weighing whether to outlaw sales of flavored
cigarettes, including menthol products, under a  2009 law  that
gave the agency regulatory authority over tobacco products. An
outside panel advised regulators in a March  report  that while
menthol cigarettes weren’t proven to be more harmful, removing
them from the market would improve public health partly because
the mint-flavored cigarettes attract new smokers.  The agency doesn’t face a deadline to make a decision, Jeff
Ventura, an agency spokesman,  said  by telephone.  More than 20 percent of adults in the U.S., or  46 million
people , smoke cigarettes, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Smoking is the nation’s
biggest cause of preventable death, killing about 443,000 people
a year, according to the public-health agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
