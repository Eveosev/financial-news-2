Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods company, reported fourth-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as sales climbed in North America.
The shares surged.  Net income rose 14 percent to $594 million, or $1.24 a
share, in the quarter ended May 31, from about $522 million, or
$1.06, a year earlier, Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said today
in a statement. Analysts projected $1.17 a share, the average of
15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker has boosted sales and
reduced marketing costs from a year earlier, when Nike promoted
around the  World Cup , to fight rising costs for cotton, labor
and transportation that have reduced profitability in the
apparel industry this year.  “Demand for the brand is strong,” said  Matt Arnold , an
analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  Des Peres ,  Missouri , who
recommends buying Nike shares. “When you are operating from a
position of strength, it’s easier to overcome that.”  Nike rose $3.65, or 4.5 percent, to $85.27 at 5:16 p.m.,
after the close of regular New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares had dropped 4.4 percent through regular
trading today.  Nike Brand Orders  Orders for the Nike brand from June to November increased
12 percent, excluding currency fluctuations. That topped the
average estimate of five analysts for a gain of 9.4 percent.  Total revenue rose 14 percent to $5.77 billion. Analysts
projected $5.54 billion, the average of 13 estimates. Sales in
 North America , Nike’s largest market, advanced 22 percent to
$2.1 billion, led by the running category.  Increased costs narrowed Nike’s gross margin, the
difference between sales and cost of goods, by 3.1 percentage
points in the quarter.  In March, Nike projected fourth-quarter gross margin would
contract by at least 3 percentage points. The company said at
the time it would start raising some prices and that such
increases would become widespread in 2012.  Nike’s gross margin shrank 1.1 percent in third quarter as
net income missed analysts’ estimates for the first time in 19
quarters and the stock sank the most in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
