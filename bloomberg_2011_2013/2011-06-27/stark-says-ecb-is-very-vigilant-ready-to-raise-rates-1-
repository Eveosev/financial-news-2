Board member Juergen Stark said the ECB is ready to raise
 interest rates  for a second time.  “We are very vigilant,” Stark said in a speech in Hamburg
today, using a phrase that signals a rate increase is imminent.
“We are ready not to leave the interest-rate increase from
April stand by itself.”  The ECB in April raised its benchmark interest rate from a
record low of 1 percent and has signaled another quarter-point
step is likely in July, even as European leaders struggle to
contain a worsening debt crisis that has eroded investor
confidence and clouded growth prospects. Inflation in the 17-
nation euro region has breached the ECB’s limit each month since
December.  “The epicenter of the crisis is in the periphery and those
countries have to contribute to solving their crisis,” Stark
said. In  Greece , “it’s not only about budget consolidation but
also about competitiveness and structural reforms,” he said,
adding that he sees “enormous potential” in privatizations.  Risks for the ECB stemming from its bond-purchase program
are “manageable” because the assets were purchased at market
prices and taken onto the bank’s balance sheet with additional
haircuts, Stark said. The ECB would no longer be able to accept
Greek bonds as collateral if rating companies downgraded the
country’s credit rating to default, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
