Serbia delegated more funds to
local-level governments as part of decentralization efforts, a
move that may force it to make spending cuts in order to keep
budget gap limits agreed with the  International Monetary Fund .  Lawmakers today voted to give 80 percent of revenue
collected from income tax back to districts and municipalities,
from 40 percent previously. Belgrade will receive 70 percent
because the capital is the most developed part of the country.
The measure is to be valid as of October 1.  The government, which faces parliamentary elections next
year, has made it a priority to help underdeveloped areas hurt
by the global economic crisis. Still, the change may require
other spending cuts in order to keep the budget gap below 4.25
percent of gross domestic product in 2011 and 3.2 percent in
2012, said Vladimir Vuckovic, a member of the Fiscal Council.  “It’s of crucial importance to prove that we can honor the
fiscal rules,” Vuckovic said. Reshuffling the revenue to boost
local-level authorities will “require finding other” spending
“items to cut, because breaching the limits would not look good
in the eyes of investors.”  Serbia, which concluded a 3 billion euro ($4.3 billion)
bailout deal with the IMF in April, plans to sign a new, 18-
month, 1 billion-euro precautionary loan program with the lender
in September.  The change “can deepen the gap by some 40 billion dinars
($560 million) in 2012, at a time when we’re supposed to
continue reducing our deficit,” Vuckovic said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
