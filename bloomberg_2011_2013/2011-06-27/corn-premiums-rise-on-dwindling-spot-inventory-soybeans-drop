Cash premiums for corn shipped in
June to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as demand by U.S. processors limited export supplies.
Soybean premiums fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 62 cents to 63 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 61 cents to 62 cents on June 24, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis declined to 72 cents to
76 cents a bushel from 73 cents to 76 cents.  “Processor and ethanol producer corn ownership is full
until August,” reducing spot supplies available for exporters,
said Scott Stoller, a grain merchandiser at Michlig Agricenter
Inc. in Manlius,  Illinois . “Soybean-export demand is very slow
and supplies appear to be more than adequate.”  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 9.25 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $6.6075 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
lowest settlement for the contract since March 17.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 9.5 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $13.2975 a bushel. The contract dropped 6.7 percent
in the previous three weeks as export demand ebbed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
