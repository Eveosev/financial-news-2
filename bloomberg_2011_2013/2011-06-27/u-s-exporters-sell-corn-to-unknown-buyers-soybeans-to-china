U.S. exporters sold 120,000 metric
tons of soft red winter wheat to unknown destinations, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in an e-mailed message. The
wheat is for delivery in the 2011-2012 marketing year, which
began June 1, the USDA said today in an e-mailed statement.  The USDA also said that a sale of 120,000 tons of soybeans
to  China  for delivery in the 2010-2011 marketing year that had
been reported as “optional origin” has been reclassified as
U.S. origin. An optional-origin contract provides that the
origin of the commodity may be the U.S. or one or more other
exporting countries. The marketing year for soybeans began Sept.
