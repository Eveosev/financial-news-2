Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM)  climbed to
a record high after the stock was rated “overweight” in new
coverage at  Barclays Capital .  The shares of Turkey’s biggest phone company rose 18 kurus,
or 2.2 percent, to 8.26 liras at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul
trading, the highest since the shares went public in May 2008.  Barclays estimates the stock will advance to 9.50 liras in
12 months, the British bank wrote in an e-mailed report.  “Everybody is long Turk Telekom anyway so they are using
the Barclays report as another excuse to push up their
positions,” Isik Okte, a trader at Finans Invest in Istanbul,
said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
