The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a lawsuit that accused two military contractors of
abusing inmates at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, turning away
an appeal by 26 onetime prisoners.  The inmates sought to sue  CACI International Inc. (CACI) , which
helped interrogate prisoners at the facility, and Titan Corp.,
which provided translation services. Titan has since been
renamed and is now part of  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)   The inmates, who were civilian detainees, said they were
subjected to abuses by CACI and Titan employees including
beatings, sexual humiliation, exposure to extreme temperatures
and rape. In court papers, the inmates said some prisoners were
tortured into unconsciousness and several were murdered.  Abu Ghraib became an international embarrassment for the
U.S. in 2004, when photographs surfaced showing guards
mistreating inmates.  Two groups of inmates were seeking to sue under the 1789
U.S. Alien Tort Statute and District of Columbia law.  A federal appeals court in  Washington  rejected the suits on
a 2-1 vote. The majority said that the Alien Tort Statute
generally canâ€™t be invoked against a private party and that
contractors are shielded from suits under state law for wartime
activities that are closely supervised by the military.  The Obama administration urged the  Supreme Court  to reject
the appeal, saying the justices should wait until more lower
courts have considered similar cases.  The case is Saleh v. CACI International, 09-1313.  To contact the reporter on this story:
