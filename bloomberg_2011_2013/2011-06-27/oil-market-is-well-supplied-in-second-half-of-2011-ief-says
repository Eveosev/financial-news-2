The oil market will be “well
supplied” in the second half of 2011 as consuming and producing
nations are pumping more crude when necessary, said Noe van Hulst, secretary general of the  International Energy Forum .  Markets are “well supplied” at the moment despite the
disruption in supplies from  Libya  caused by the armed conflict
in the country, he said in a telephone interview today.
Commitments of producers such as  Saudi Arabia  to increase
output, and the plan by International Energy Agency members to
release oil stockpiles, will leave the market with ample supply
in the second half of the year, van Hulst said.  Brent crude on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
rose to a 2 1/2-year high of $127.02 a barrel on April 11 as
armed conflict halted exports from Libya and concern grew that
political unrest in the  Middle East  could affect other oil-
producing nations such as Syria, Yemen and Egypt.  “The markets have to calm down as consumers and producers
are doing what they can to remedy the market from any
disruption,” the secretary general of the Riyadh-based
organization said.  Van Hulst said there is a consensus among large oil
producers and consuming nations that geopolitical concerns are
overstated and that the physical markets are well supplied, with
comfortable levels of spare capacity and stockpiles.  IEF is the largest global gathering of energy ministers
with over 80 countries including Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries member states,  United States ,  China , India,
Russia, Brazil and Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
