China , the world’s biggest emitter
of  greenhouse gases , plans to set up a unified national carbon-
trading platform by 2015, Beijing News  reported , citing Tang
Maosong, director of the China Beijing Environmental Exchange.  The report didn’t give details of the plan. China said
previously that it plans to accelerate the development of a
carbon-trading system to help cut emissions.  The nation is taking measures to meet a target of cutting
the quantity of carbon it emits per unit of economic output by
as much as 45 percent in 2020 from 2005 levels.  China is working on setting up a carbon-trading market and
there is no time-frame for the plan,  Su Wei , head of climate-
change negotiations at the National Development and Reform
Commission, said June 21.  It plans to start carbon-trading pilot programs in the
cities of Beijing, Chongqing,  Shanghai , Tianjin and the
provinces of Hubei and Guangdong during the five years through
2015, the China Securities Journal reported May 27, without
citing anybody.  A cap-and-trade system puts a price on carbon by setting
limits on the quantity of emissions that polluters can produce.
Those exceeding the limit must buy credits to offset their
emissions, while those that emit less can sell their balance in
the carbon market.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
