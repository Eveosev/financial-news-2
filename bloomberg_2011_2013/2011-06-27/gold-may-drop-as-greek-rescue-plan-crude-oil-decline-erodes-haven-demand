Gold declined, after capping the
biggest weekly drop in seven weeks, as weaker  oil prices  and a
pledge by European Union leaders to avert a Greek default
slashed the metal’s appeal as a haven.  Bullion for immediate delivery declined as much as 0.3
percent to $1,498.15 an ounce and was at $1,500.18 by 3:17 p.m.
in  Seoul . It plunged 2.4 percent last week, the biggest loss
since the week ending May 6. Futures for August delivery were
little changed at $1,500.50 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  “In addition to the Greek rescue plan, gold is falling on
the back of the strengthening dollar,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. “Oil
tumbled, lowering inflation pressure.”  EU leaders vowed to help stave off a Greek default as long
as Prime Minister  George Papandreou  pushes through a package of
budget cuts this week. European finance chiefs will decide on
July 3 whether Greece has met the conditions for its next aid.
Greek lawmakers are expected to start a three-day debate today
and vote on the austerity measures on June 29.  The dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of six major
currencies, after rising for three straight weeks, eroding the
allure of gold as an alternative investment. Crude oil lost 1.1
percent after falling 2 percent last week, the fourth straight
decline, reducing demand for an inflation hedge.  Gold, which has increased 5.5 percent this year, gained as
much as 0.2 percent to $1,506.28 an ounce earlier.  “There might be some people who say the correction is
done,” said Viral Shah, vice president at Geojit Comtrade Ltd.
in Mumbai. “We are at the lower end of the range so probably we
will see some bounces. There is a lot of interest to buy gold at
lower prices.”  The price reached a record $1,577.57 on May 2 as  Greece ’s
debt crisis and record-low U.S. borrowing costs boosted demand
for an alternative to currencies.  Immediate-delivery silver dropped 1.8 percent to $33.68 an
ounce after plunging 4.4 percent last week, the fourth straight
loss. Cash palladium declined 1.2 percent to $725.50 an ounce
and spot platinum decreased 0.9 percent to $1,674.25 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
