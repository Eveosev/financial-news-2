India’s benchmark stock index rose
for the third day, extending the biggest rally in four months,
as a drop in oil outweighed concern an increase in local fuel
prices will stoke inflation.  Oil &  Natural Gas  Corp., the nation’s largest state-owned
explorer, surged the most in a month, and Indian Oil Corp. rose
3.2 percent after the government increased diesel costs for the
first time in a year. Oil fell in  New York  as the  International
Energy Agency  said it’s prepared to release more stockpiles to
stabilize prices.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering
company, added 2.7 percent.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
171.73, or 0.9 percent, to 18,412.41 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. The measure surged the most since March 1 on June 24 as
crude prices plunged. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange climbed 1 percent to 5,526.60 and its June
futures settled at 5,536.60. The BSE 200 Index added 1.1 percent
to 2,274.30.  “The fuel price hike will raise inflation by 1 percentage
point but that will be more than offset by a decline in global
commodity prices,” said  Manish Sonthalia , who manages $300
million in equities at Motilal Oswal Asset Management Co. in
Mumbai. “Lower commodity prices are the biggest positive.”  Policy makers allowed state refiners June 24 to increase
diesel prices by 3 rupees (7 cents) a liter, kerosene by 2
rupees a liter and cooking gas by 50 rupees for every 14.2
kilogram bottle. Refiners lost 450 billion rupees ($10 billion)
in the first quarter from selling fuel below cost.  Asia ’s third-biggest economy caps diesel and cooking-fuel
prices to shield 66 percent of the population that lives on less
than $2 a day from price pressures.  India ’s inflation is running
at 9.06 percent, more than twice the rate in the U.S. and almost
four times  Germany ’s.  ‘Sweet Spot’  Oil & Natural Gas jumped 4.2 percent to 284.2 rupees, the
most since May 26. Indian Oil, the biggest refiner, gained 3.2
percent to 347.7 rupees. Bharat Petroleum Corp. climbed 4.6
percent to 663.95 rupees. Hindustan Petroleum Corp. surged 5.8
percent to 415.4 rupees.  “The government has set the ball rolling with the fuel
price hike and is now in a sweet spot to fully decontrol diesel
prices,” Motilal’s Sonthalia said. “Oil-marketing companies
will not incur any losses if Brent comes to $90 a barrel.”  August-delivery Brent oil fell as much as 2.7 percent to
$102.28 a barrel in  London . Prices tumbled 2 percent to $105.12
on June 24, the lowest close since Feb. 18.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, increased 2.9 percent to 693.3
rupees amid speculation higher farm output, spurred by above-
average rain, will boost demand for its tractors.  India’s  monsoon,  the main source of irrigation for the
nation’s 235 million farmers, was 7 percent above a 50-year
average since the season began June 1, the weather office.  Economic Headwinds  The Sensex is the second-worst performer among Asian
benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg this year as India’s
central bank has raised rates 10 times since the start of last
year to cool rising consumer and food prices. Sensex stocks are
valued at 14.9 times estimated earnings, compared with 10.8 for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Still, the economic headwinds are starting to “subside,”
Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts led by Prabhat Awasthi wrote in a
report today. The firm is changing its “bearish” stance amid
the “significant” underperformance of Indian stocks this year
and as inflation momentum shows signs of slowing.  ‘Buying Opportunity’  “While growth has been a casualty of increasing rates and
policy procrastination, we are encouraged by slower growth as it
eases pressures on India’s supply-side constrained economy,”
Awasthi wrote. “A correction in the market should be used as a
buying opportunity.”  Sensex companies are trading at a 17 percent discount to
their average valuation over five years, indicating the market
has priced in “significant risk,” Awasthi estimated. His top
stock picks are Larsen & Toubro, Mahindra & Mahindra, DLF Ltd.,
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the country’s second-biggest lender, rose
1.4 percent to 1,079.4 rupees.  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the biggest,
advanced 1.8 percent to 2,326 rupees.  Larsen climbed 2.7 percent to 1,786.5 rupees and its June
futures settled at 1,788 rupees.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA)  climbed 1.8
percent to 589.35 rupees.  Overseas investors bought a net 4.84 billion rupees ($108
million) of Indian stocks on June 23, the first purchase in 10
days, paring their withdrawals from local equities this year to
19.3 billion rupees, data compiled by the regulator show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
