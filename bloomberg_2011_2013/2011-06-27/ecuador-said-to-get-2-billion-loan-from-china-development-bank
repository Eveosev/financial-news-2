Ecuador  signed a $2 billion loan
with China Development Bank Corp., its second in less than a
year, as the Asian nation seeks to secure energy and commodities
supplies to meet demand in the world’s second-biggest economy.  The agreement was signed in Beijing yesterday, Ecuador’s
 Finance Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement, without
providing more details. Finance Minister  Patricio Rivera  said
June 14 the loan will be used to finance budgeted public works
projects and will have a maturity of eight years.  China is the world’s largest energy consumer and has become
the South American nation’s biggest credit source since Ecuador
defaulted on $3.2 billion of bonds in 2008 and 2009. The Asian
nation has loaned Ecuador, the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries’ smallest member, at least $6.68 billion
since 2009 for projects ranging from the construction of a
hydroelectric dam to cash advances to guarantee future crude
shipments to  China .  “This type of loan shows investors that Ecuador is worthy
of credit, at least for the Chinese,” said Paul Palacios, the
president of Albion Casa de Valores SA, the nation’s third-
largest brokerage.  State-owned China Development Bank is the country’s largest
overseas lender with $134.6 billion in foreign currency loans
last year, Chairman  Chen Yuan  said May 31. The volume of foreign
currency loans increased more than eightfold during the past
five years, according to the bank’s 2010 annual report.  Ecuador Loans  Yesterday’s loan comes on top of the $1 billion that
PetroChina Co., the Asian nation’s largest oil producer,
released in February in exchange for future oil sales. Ecuador
negotiated a similar deal with China for $1 billion in 2009.  Ecuador got a separate $1 billion, four-year loan from
 China Development Bank  last year for infrastructure projects at
an interest rate of 6 percent. The Export-Import Bank of China
in June 2010 agreed to finance a $1.68 billion, 1,500-megawatt
hydropower plant known as  Coca-Codo Sinclair  in the Amazon
region. China’s Sinohydro Corp. will build it.  The yield on Ecuador’s 9.375 percent bonds maturing in 2015
fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.57
percent as of 5:21 p.m. New York time yesterday, the biggest
drop on a closing basis in almost two weeks. The price of the
security rose 0.09 cent to 99.31 cents on the dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Andean country’s dollar debt yields 806 basis points
more than U.S. Treasuries, the second-most among 15 emerging
markets tracked by JPMorgan’s EMBI+ index, after  Venezuela . Debt
from  Argentina , which defaulted on $95 billion in 2001, yields
622 basis points more than Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
