It’s too early to assume that Poland
is finished with interest-rate increases,  Jerzy Hausner  of the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Council was quoted today as
saying in an interview in  Gazeta Wyborcza .  Hausner said the central bank “has done what it can” to
curb inflation without harming economic growth and that it is
now up to the government to “build a fiscal balance” that
supports economic expansion, the newspaper reported.   Poland’s growth rate may decline to about 3 percent due to
budget cuts, slowing public investments and a weaker net
contribution of exports to gross domestic product, Hausner said,
according to Gazeta. The inflation rate will probably fall to
the central bank’s 2.5 target in about a year, the newspaper
quoted Hausner as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
