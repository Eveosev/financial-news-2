A proposal to question Iranian
President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  in parliament about some
“irregularities” by his administration has been signed by 100
lawmakers and submitted to country’s main legislative body,
state-run  Mehr News agency reported .  The document, submitted yesterday to the Majlis presiding
board, raises issues including delays in the nomination of a
sports and youth minister and the use of funds for the Tehran
Metro, the report published on Mehr’s website yesterday said.  Iran ’s constitution requires the president to appear before
parliament when at least 25 percent of the country’s lawmakers
submits such a request. He must appear before parliament within
a month of the submission, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
