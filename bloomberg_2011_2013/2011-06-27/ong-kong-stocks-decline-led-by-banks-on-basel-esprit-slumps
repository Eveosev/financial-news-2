Hong Kong stocks swung between gains
and losses ahead of a vote by Greek lawmakers that may allow
budget cuts needed to secure financial aid, reducing risk for
banks, and as  Li & Fung Ltd. (494)  slumped after UBS AG reiterated a
‘sell’ on the shares.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Europe ’s biggest bank by market value,
gained 0.9 percent.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that counts
Europe as its biggest market, climbed 1.9 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) ,
an oil producer, increased 1.5 percent after crude  oil prices 
advanced. Li & Fung Ltd. posted the largest decline in the Hang
Seng Index after UBS analyst Spencer Leung said quality was
falling at the world’s No. 1 supplier of clothes and toys to
retailers.  “People are waiting for something to happen and whether
the Greek problem will be solved,” said  Castor Pang , head of
research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi International Ltd. in  Hong
Kong . “Overall sentiment will be weak, as the Greek issue and
inflationary concerns in China remain.”  The Hang Seng Index was little changed at 22,074.26 as of
3:10 p.m. after rising 0.8 percent and falling 0.2 percent local
time. About five shares rose for every four that fell on the 46-
member gauge. The index has recovered 2.2 percent from June 17,
when the measure entered a so-called correction, or a more than
10 percent decline from its April 8 high this year, as China
intensified efforts to fight inflation and on mounting concern
 Greece  would fail to resolve its debt crisis.  HSBC,  Standard Chartered   The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of Chinese companies’

capital flight from China,” said Haitong’s Yan. “This has
started to reverse now, and there’s a liquidity issue. There’s
not enough liquidity in Hong Kong.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve said on June 22 that the central
bank would complete $600 billion in bond-buying -- the second
round, dubbed QE2 -- as scheduled this month.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  has fallen 4.2 percent this year
