Last year’s Deepwater Horizon rig
disaster will continue to slow offshore production in  North
America , said William Kovacic, a commissioner at the U.S.
 Federal Trade Commission .  “Deepwater Horizon is going to stall offshore production
for a long time,” Kovacic said today at a seminar in Lisbon.
“There are going to be continuing concerns domestically about
drilling elsewhere.”  The Deepwater Horizon rig was destroyed in the April 2010
blowout of BP Plc’s Macondo well in the  Gulf of Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
