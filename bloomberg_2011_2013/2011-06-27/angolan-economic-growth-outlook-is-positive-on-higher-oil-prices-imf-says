The outlook for Angola’s economy is
positive amid higher  oil prices , the  International Monetary Fund 
said.  “Angola’s economy continues to recover from the 2009
fiscal and balance of payments crises,” the IMF said in an e-
mailed statement after a staff team visited Luanda from May 25
to June 8. “Macroeconomic prospects for 2011 are positive,
reflecting higher oil prices and projected oil production of
around 1.7 million barrels per day.”  The fund noted that as the global environment “remains
unusually uncertain, the authorities are also committed to
further strengthen foreign reserves as a buffer against oil
revenue volatility, a key program objective.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
