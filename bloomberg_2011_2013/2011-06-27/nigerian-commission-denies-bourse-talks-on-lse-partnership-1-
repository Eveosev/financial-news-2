Nigeria ’s Securities and Exchange
Commission denied a report by the  Independent on Sunday  that the
country’s bourse held partnership talks with the  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE) , SEC Director General Arunma Oteh said.  “I was misquoted,” Oteh said in an interview today in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital. Oteh said she told the
newspaper that while the bourse had considered using LSE’s
trading platform, it eventually settled for the Nasdaq platform.  Oscar Onyema, chief executive officer of the Nigerian
exchange, said by phone today from Moscow that he wasn’t aware
of such talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
