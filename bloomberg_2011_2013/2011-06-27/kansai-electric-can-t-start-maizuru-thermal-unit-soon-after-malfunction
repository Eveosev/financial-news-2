Kansai Electric Power Co. said the
900-megawatt No. 1 unit at its Maizuru thermal plant in western
 Japan  won’t restart in time to meet a capacity shortfall from
closing nuclear reactors for maintenance.  The coal-fired Maizuru unit was shut on May 30 after a
malfunction and the company can’t say when it will resume
operation, spokesman Kazushige Maeda said by phone.  Kansai Electric will shut two nuclear reactors with
combined capacity of 2,050 megawatts by the end of August, Maeda
said.  The company earlier requested customers try to cut power
demand by 15 percent to meet potential shortfalls, after the
March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out generation capacity
in other parts of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
