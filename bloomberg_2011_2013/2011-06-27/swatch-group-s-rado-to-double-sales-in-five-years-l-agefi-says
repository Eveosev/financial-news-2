Swatch Group AG (UHR) ’s Rado brand aims to
double sales within five years,  L’Agefi  said, citing division
Chief Executive Officer Matthias Breschan.  Rado has increased prices as much as 5 percent to offset
the gains of the Swiss franc, Breschan told the newspaper.
Swatch Group doesn’t disclose revenue for the brand, whose
watches sell mostly for 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,200) to 3,000
francs, L’Agefi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
