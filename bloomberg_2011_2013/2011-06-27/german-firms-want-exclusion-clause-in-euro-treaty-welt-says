An association of German family-run
companies says it wants mechanisms included in the treaty
governing  Europe â€™s single currency that would allow countries to
be excluded from membership, Die  Welt  reported.  Around a hundred firms belonging to the  Stiftung
Familienunternehmen  signed a letter to lawmakers saying it
should be made possible for a country to exit the euro or to be
excluded for running excessive deficits, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
