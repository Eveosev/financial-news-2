Tea production in  Burundi  may
decline 2.6 percent this year after the crop was damaged by a
hail storm in February, the Burundi Tea Board said.  Output may drop from 8,025 tons a year earlier, Alexis
Nzobonimana, a director of the Bujumbura-based board, said in an
interview on June 23. The storm earlier this year damaged almost
all the tea plantations in the country, he said. Growers have
also failed to apply fertilizer to their crops, he said.  “They are not able to afford fertilizers prices,”
Nzobonimana said.  Burundi relies on tea and coffee to generate 90 percent of
its foreign-exchange earnings, according to the CIA World
Factbook. Yields in the East African country have fallen from
more than 9,000 tons in 2001 because of an insurgency that
displaced small-scale farmers, who account for 80 percent of
production. In the first five months of this year, farmers
harvested 4,492 tons of the leaves, Nzobonimana said.  The Tea Board plans to help boost production by urging
farmers to use more fertilizer. Growers are also being paid more
for their crop, Nzobonimana said.  In January, the price paid to tea farmers for their leaves
was increased to 220 Burundian francs (18 cents) from 200
francs. The rate is expected to be revised every six months, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
