China Youngman Automobile Group Co.
is the new frontrunner for a deal with with  Saab Automobile , the
Swedish carmaker owned by  Spyker Cars NV (SPYKR) ,  Dagens Industri 
reported, citing unidentified sources.  Youngman , based in the Chinese city of Jinan, has been
holding discussions with Saab for months, and has emerged as the
prime candidate for an investment and production deal after
Saab’s tentative agreement with Hawtai Motor Group ended May 12,
the Swedish newspaper said.  Eric Geers, a Saab spokesman, didn’t immediately return a
phone message seeking comment.  Youngman, together with Great Wall Motor Co. and Jiangsu
Yueda Group Co., on April 29 were the main candidates for
signing an agreement with Saab before the Trollhaettan, Sweden-
based carmaker selected Hawtai on May 3, two people with direct
knowledge of the matter said at the time.  Saab is holding investment talks with “various” potential
Chinese partners, Spyker said on May 12.  Saab first halted production on March 29 amid a payment
dispute with component suppliers. Production will resume after
additional funding is secured, Spyker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
