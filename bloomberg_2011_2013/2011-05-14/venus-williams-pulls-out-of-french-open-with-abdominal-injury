Venus Williams withdrew from the
 French Open , joining her sister Serena on the sideline for the
season’s second Grand Slam tennis tournament.  Venus Williams, 30, still hasn’t recovered from an
abdominal injury sustained at the Australian Open in January,
French Open organizers said in a statement. The seven-time Grand
Slam champion was limited to one tournament in the final six
months of 2010 by a left knee injury.  Serena Williams, 29, pulled out of the tournament two days
ago because she’s still recovering from a blood clot. It will be
the first Grand Slam without either of the Americans since 2003.  The French Open begins May 22 at  Roland Garros  in Paris.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
