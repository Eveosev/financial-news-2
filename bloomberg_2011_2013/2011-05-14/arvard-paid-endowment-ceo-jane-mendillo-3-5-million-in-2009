Harvard University , the world’s
richest school, paid Jane Mendillo $3.5 million in 2009 as the
fund began rebounding from a record loss during the global
financial crisis.  Mendillo, who took over as president and chief executive
officer of Harvard Management Co. in July 2008, was the fourth
highest-paid  money manager  at the endowment, according to a
statement from the university yesterday. She made almost $1
million for six months of work in 2008.  The fund’s top internal managers on Mendillo’s staff earned
about $25.3 million combined, the Cambridge, Massachusetts,
university said. In 2008, the top-paid executives earned almost
$26 million.  Harvard’s investments climbed 11 percent in the year ended
June 30, 2010, beating the school’s own benchmark while trailing
the average return of a broad group of institutions. The $27.6
billion fund recouped some of its losses from the previous year,
when investments dropped 27 percent. Following the decline,
Mendillo moved to reduce the influence of independent firms that
oversee two-thirds of the fund.  The endowment’s model of combining internal managers with
outside firms “is extremely cost effective for the university,
operating at a fraction of the expense of equivalent external
management, saving Harvard over $1 billion in management fees
over the past decade,” said James Rothenberg, Harvard’s
treasurer, in the statement.  The endowment fell a record 30 percent to $26 billion from
$36.9 billion in the year ended June 30, 2009. John Longbrake, a
Harvard spokesman, declined to comment beyond the company’s
statement.  Stephen Blyth  Harvard’s highest-paid manager in 2009 was Stephen Blyth,
the head of internal  portfolio management , whose pay rose 32
percent from the previous year to $8.44 million.  Blyth was followed by Steven Alperin, an emerging-market
stocks manager who earned $6.85 million, and Apoorva Koticha, a
bond manager who made $4.47 million. Marc Seidner, a former
manager in the fixed-income group, earned $2.9 million while
Graig Fantuzzi, of the bond unit, got $2.73 million.  Jack Meyer , who ran the endowment for 15 years, resigned in
2005 amid complaints by an alumni group from the class of 1969
about money-manager compensation. Alumni first criticized pay
packages in 2003, calling them excessive in a letter to  Lawrence Summers , then the school’s president. The top six in-house
managers earned a combined $107.5 million in the previous year.
Alumni members said more money should be used for scholarships,
even if that meant lower returns from the endowment.  Under Mendillo, Harvard revamped its compensation
structure, saying pay for her senior managers will be linked to
the fund’s performance for the first time. The school has also
increased the number of years before it pays out total bonuses,
the endowment said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
