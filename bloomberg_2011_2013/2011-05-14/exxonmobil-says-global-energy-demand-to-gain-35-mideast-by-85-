Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  expects global
energy demand to increase 35 percent by 2030 compared with 2005
and demand in the Middle East to climb 85 percent during the
period as electricity needs rise to match population gains.  “Oil, natural gas and coal will continue to meet most of
the world’s needs during this period because no other energy
sources can match their availability, versatility, affordability
and scale,” said Rob Gardner, manager for the energy and
economics division of Exxon Mobil’s Corporate Strategic Planning
department.  Power generation will represent 55 percent of the total
growth in demand and in 2030 will account for about 40 percent
of total primary energy consumption, Gardner said today at a
seminar in  Riyadh ,  Saudi Arabia .  “The key role oil and natural gas plays in the global
energy outlook for decades to come underlines the importance of
the Middle East region as a major supplier in meeting the
world’s needs,” Gardner said, while discussing his company’s
outlook for energy to the year 2030.  According to Exxon’s outlook, efforts to secure reliable
and affordable energy, while limiting greenhouse gas pollution,
will lead to many countries putting a cost on carbon dioxide
emissions. As a result, natural gas will become increasingly
competitive as a source of power generation as its use results
in less CO2 releases than other energy sources, he said.  The cost of producing one metric ton of carbon dioxide will
reach about $60 in Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development nations over the coming years if strict policies
were applied, said Gardner, who is responsible of producing the
company’s thirty years outlook.  To contact the reporters on this story:
