Kenya  will raise the maximum retail
price for the most-commonly used gasoline by 3.8 percent in the
capital, Nairobi, after global crude costs climbed,  Energy
Regulatory Commission  said.  The price of “super” gasoline will increase to 115.35
shillings ($1.35) per liter from tomorrow until June 14, the
Nairobi-based agency said in its monthly review of fuel costs,
e-mailed today. Nairobi, Kenya’s most-populated city, accounts
for as much as 55 percent of total fuel consumption in East
Africa’s biggest economy.  Kenyan inflation rose for the sixth consecutive month to
12.05 percent in April after  transport  costs, which include
petrol and diesel, advanced 20 percent compared with a year
earlier, and food costs surged 19 percent.  “We have noted that since the beginning of May 2011 the
international prices of both crude oil and refined petroleum
products have started a downward trend,” the statement said.
“Any decrease in the procurement costs realized during the
month of May will be passed on to consumers in the next price
review.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
