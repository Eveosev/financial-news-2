Manchester United  won its record 19th
English soccer championship today with a 1-1 tie at Blackburn.  Following a win over second-place Chelsea last week, United
needed just a draw at Ewood Park to eclipse the mark of 18
titles it shared with Liverpool. It’s the club’s 12th Premier
League championship in the 19-year history of the league.  Wayne Rooney ’s 73rd-minute penalty kick earned United the
tie after Brett Emerton scored in the first half for Blackburn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
