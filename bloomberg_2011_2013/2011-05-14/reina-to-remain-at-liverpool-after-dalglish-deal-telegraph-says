Goalkeeper Pepe Reina has been
convinved to stay at Liverpool after  Kenny Dalglish  was made the
permanent manager yesterday, the  Daily Telegraph  said.  Media reports in the U.K. said the 28-year-old may leave
for a club playing in the Champions League next season.  Dalglish signed a three-year contract yesterday after
taking Liverpool up to fifth place from 12th place since
replacing Roy Hodgson in January. Reina has been convinced to
stay by the results on the field and the change of atmosphere at
the club, the Telegraph said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
