Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
asked three government ministers, including Oil Minister Masoud Mir-Kazemi, to step down as part of plans to combine some
ministries.  The responsibilities of Mir-Kazemi, as well as Industry and
Mines Minister Ali Akbar Mehrabian and Welfare Minister Sadegh
Mahsouli, have ended, Ahmadinejad said in separate letters
published on the Tehran-based presidency  website  today.  Iran  announced May 9 that the oil ministry will merge into
the energy ministry to help reduce the number of departments to
17 from 21 and boost the administration’s efficiency. The
Industries and Mines Ministry will be combined with the Commerce
Ministry and the Welfare Ministry with the Labor Ministry.  Ahmadinejad’s government will need to nominate ministers
for the combined ministries to parliament, senior parliamentary
member Hossein Sobhaninia said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
