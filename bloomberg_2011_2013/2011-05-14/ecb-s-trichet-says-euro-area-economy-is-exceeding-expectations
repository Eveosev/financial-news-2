European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the euro-area economy is exceeding
expectations and first-quarter growth was “encouraging.”  “Quarter after quarter, the data has frequently exceeded
expectations,” Trichet said in an interview with  Spain ’s El
Pais, according to a text published by the Frankfurt-based ECB.
“This has been particularly evident in the first quarter of
this year with an increase of 0.8 percent, more than projected,
and several economies in the euro area with better results, even
significantly better than expected. We have to be very cautious
and we do not declare victory, but I think that’s encouraging.”  Asked about the ECB’s opposition to a Greek debt
restructuring, Trichet said Greece should continue to implement
its fiscal consolidation plan.  “What we are asking for is that the plan be implemented as
strictly as possible, as it was negotiated, with rigorous
efforts being made by  Greece ,” he said. “There is no other way
than the strict application of this adjustment plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
