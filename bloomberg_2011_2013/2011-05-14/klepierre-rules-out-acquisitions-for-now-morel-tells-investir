Klepierre (LI)  SA ruled out acquisitions
and is betting on internal growth, Investir reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Laurent Morel.  The company sees no acquisition target that would
“immediately create value,” Morel told the French weekly
newspaper in an  interview  published today.  Europe ’s second-
largest shopping-center owner has its own pipeline of projects
to build sites or to expand existing ones that’s worth more than
3 billion euros ($4.24 billion), Morel was cited as saying. The
company will remain “very opportunistic” in terms of
investments in office spaces, he said.  Paris-based Klepierre will continue with assets sales,
Morel told Investir. The company plans to sell each year 200
million euros to 300 million euros worth of its less profitable
assets, he said. The company spends as much as 600 million euros
annually in investments, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
