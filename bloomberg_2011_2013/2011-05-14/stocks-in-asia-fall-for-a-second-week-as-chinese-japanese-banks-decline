Asian stocks fell, dragging the
region’s benchmark index to its second straight weekly drop as
 China  restricted bank lending, stoking concern anti-inflation
policies may slow growth in the world’s second-biggest economy.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the nation’s
biggest lender, lost 1.1 percent in  Hong Kong . Mitsui & Co.,
which gets 42 percent of sales from commodities, sank 3.1
percent in Tokyo on speculation monetary tightening in China,
the world’s No. 1 user of copper and aluminum, will crimp
demand. Japanese banks fell as the government said lenders may
have to write off loans to Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of a
nuclear reactor crippled by the March earthquake.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index declined 1 percent to 136.17
this week. The gauge dropped 1.4 percent the previous week as
U.S. economic data and plunging commodity prices added to signs
a global economic recovery is faltering, and as the  Federal
Reserve  prepares to end a $600 billion asset-purchase program
known as quantitative easing.  “Investors are worried inflation may slow a recovery in
the global economy,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee
about $17 billion as chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management
Co. in Tokyo. “That may cause a slump in global demand,
trimming companies’ earnings outlooks.”  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 2.1 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi index dropped 1.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index lost 0.7 percent in the week, as the statistics bureau
reported the nation’s employers unexpectedly cut workers in
April by the most since 2009.  Reserve Requirements  China’s lenders dropped after the nation’s central bank on
May 12 raised lenders’ reserve requirements for the fifth time
this year, prompting analysts from Credit Suisse Group AG to
Citic Securities Co. to predict further tightening.  China’s inflation held above 5 percent in April and lending
exceeded analyst estimates, signaling that further monetary
tightening may be needed to cool the world’s fastest-growing
major economy.  “Markets always struggle with tightening cycles,” said
James Holt, Sydney-based director of BlackRock Investment
Management (Australia) Ltd., which oversees about $40 billion in
assets. “The China inflation data show that the country will
need to do more tightening.”  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  dropped 1.1 percent
to HK$6.40.  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , the nation’s third-biggest
lender, lost 0.5 percent to HK$4.24. China Merchants Bank Co.
declined 1.7 percent to HK$19.48.  Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. (1638) , a
Hong Kong-based developer of properties in China, slumped 18
percent to HK$2.77.  ‘Hard Landing’  “China’s reserve ratio requirement rise has been seen by
some investors as adding to the risks of a hard landing,” said
 Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which manages $98 billion in Sydney. “In my
view this perception is mistaken.”  Raw material producers declined as a Bloomberg survey
released this week showed global investors have tempered their
optimism about the U.S. and world economies and plan to put more
of their money in cash and less in commodities over the next six
months.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , which gets about 40 percent of sales from
commodities, sank 4.4 percent to 2,080 yen in Tokyo. Rival
Mitsui & Co. dropped 3.1 percent to 1,368 yen.  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company, lost 0.6 percent to
A$44.32 in Sydney, capping five straight weeks of declines.  Japanese Banks  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
publicly traded lender, fell 2.5 percent to 383 yen, while
smaller rival  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  declined 3.3
percent to 2,452 yen after Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that “people won’t support” using
taxpayer funds for Tokyo Electric unless banks waive some loans
made before the March 11 earthquake.  Tepco, as the company is known, lost 0.4 percent to 453 yen
after Kyodo News reported this week that the utility found holes
in the bottom of the pressure vessel of a reactor.  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) , South Korea’s fourth-largest
financial company, tumbled 14 percent to 37,850 won in Seoul
after Chairman Kim Seung Yu expressed concern that his bid for
Korea Exchange Bank may fail as regulators delay approval.  To contact the reporters on this story:
