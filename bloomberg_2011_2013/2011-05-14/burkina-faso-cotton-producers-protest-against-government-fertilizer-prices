Cotton growers in western  Burkina
Faso ,  Africa ’s biggest producer of the fiber, held protests in
two cities yesterday against government-set prices and
threatened to boycott the crop season, union officials said.  More than 2,000 producers demonstrated in Bobo Dioulasso,
360 kilometers (217 miles) west of the capital, Ouagadougou,
Abou Ouattara, president of a producers union in Houet Bobo
province, said in an interview yesterday. About 2,500 people
marched in Dedougou, 250 kilometers northwest of the capital,
Nouhanta Bonzi, a spokesman of the demonstrators, said by phone.  The growers demand fertilizer prices be reduced to last
year’s levels, Ouattara said. The state increased the price by
38 percent. Farmers also want the government to double the
minimum price it pays growers to 500  CFA francs  ($1.07) per
kilogram (2.2 pounds). The West African state raised the fee by
35 percent to 245 francs on April 25.  Burkina Faso produced 226,000 metric tons of cotton in
2008, the latest data available on the Food and Agricultural
Organization’s  website . The country is the world’s 11th biggest
grower of the fiber, according to the United Nations agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
