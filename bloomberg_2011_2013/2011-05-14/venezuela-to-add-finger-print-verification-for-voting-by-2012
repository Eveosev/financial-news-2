Venezuela ’s electoral board approved
a device for finger print verification to be added to
computerized voting machines in time for regional and
presidential elections to be held in 2012.  The move aims to confirm voter identity and limit fraud,
according to a  statement  dated May 12 and posted on the
electoral board’s website. Venezuela’s opposition has accused
President  Hugo Chavez  of manipulating the country’s electronic
voting machines even as international groups have endorsed
election results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
