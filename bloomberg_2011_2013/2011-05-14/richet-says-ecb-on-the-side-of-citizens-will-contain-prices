European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said the bank will ensure  price stability  even as
the euro area grapples with a sovereign debt crisis.  “The current period is still not easy,” Trichet said in a
guest column for  Germany ’s Bild newspaper, according to a text
published by the ECB. “The citizens can trust that the ECB will
ensure price stability in the years to come as we did in the
last 12 years. We are on the side of citizens. We know that
inflation hurts the weakest members of society most, and we will
do all that is necessary to prevent inflation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
