Peer Steinbrueck, the finance
minister in German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s first-term
government, signalled that he is ready to stand as chancellor-
candidate for the opposition  Social Democratic Party , Deutsche
Presse-Agentur reported, citing comments made in an interview to
be broadcast on  Hessischer Rundfunk  tomorrow.  Steinbrueck was quoted as saying that the “time will
come” when he consults with SPD leaders about possibly running
against Merkel at the 2013 federal election, DPA said. The SPD
will only decide on its lead candidate within a year at the
