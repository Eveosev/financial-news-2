The Public and Commercial Services
Union is planning a national strike on June 30 and will ask
workers to vote next week, the London-based  Times  reported,
citing  Mark Serwotka , its general secretary.  The U.K.’s largest civil service union will ask members at
its annual conference on May 18 to vote on a motion to strike
against cuts to jobs, pay and pensions, the newspaper said.  U.K. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude has ordered
emergency strike-breaking operations to be put in place,
according to the report.  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
