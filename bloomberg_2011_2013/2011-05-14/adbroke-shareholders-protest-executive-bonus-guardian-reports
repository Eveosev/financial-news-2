Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  shareholders yesterday
protested against the U.K. bookmaker’s remuneration report,
according to the  Guardian  which didn’t cite anyone.  Forty-five percent of its investors either voted against or
withheld their support after being angered by a 350,000 pounds
($566,300) retention bonus awarded to Brian Wallace, the
outgoing finance director, the newspaper said. A Ladbrokes
spokesman said they had “noted the disquiet,” according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
