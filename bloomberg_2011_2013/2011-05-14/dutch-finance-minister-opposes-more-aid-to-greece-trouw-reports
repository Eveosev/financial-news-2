Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  opposes extra financial aid to Greece before the country
has met conditions it agreed to with the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund ,  Trouw  reported.  Representatives of the EU, the IMF and the European Central
Bank are in Greece to check if the government is doing enough to
reduce its budget deficit and to implement economic reforms,
according to the Dutch newspaper. If not, De Jager wants to
withhold a payment of 12 billion euros ($17 billion) scheduled
for June, Trouw cited him as saying after a cabinet meeting in
The Hague yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
