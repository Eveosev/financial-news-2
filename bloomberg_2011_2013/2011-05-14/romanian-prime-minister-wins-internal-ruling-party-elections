Romanian Prime Minister Emil Boc has
won an internal election held by his ruling Democrat-Liberal
Party, confirming support for his Cabinet.  Boc, 45, won with more than 60 percent of the vote,
according to a preliminary count, Sulfina Barbu, the Liberal
Democrat who oversaw the elections, said in a phone interview
from Bucharest today.  The Democrat-Liberals, part of the ruling coalition and
facing general elections next year, saw their public support cut
in almost half in a year to 20 percent over measures taken to
keep funds from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union flowing in 2009 and 2010, a poll conducted between May 11
and May 13 by the Bucharest-based polling company CURS showed.  Boc’s government, which survived five no-confidence votes
in the past year, has embarked on a budget austerity program to
reassure investors it will maintain fiscal discipline ahead of
elections, after signing a new two-year precautionary agreement
with the international lenders, worth 5 billion euros ($7
billion). It plans to narrow the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of
gross-domestic product next year, from 6.5 percent in 2010.  “Romania will have difficulties meeting this pledge,
without reforming the unprofitable state-owned enterprises,”
IMF Mission Chief Jeffrey Franks said May 9.  The administration cut public wages 25 percent and raised
the value-added tax 5 percentage points to 24 percent last year
to narrow the budget shortfall, boosting inflation and prompting
the central bank to halt its rate-cutting cycle aimed at shoring
up the economy.  The Balkan nation’s economy is poised to recover from a
two-year recession and grow as much as 1.5 percent this year,
according to the IMF.  To contact the reporters on this story:
