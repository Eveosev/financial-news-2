Tokyo Electric Power Co. increased
its crude and  fuel-oil  consumption last month after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami forced the utility to shut two of its
nuclear power plants.  The Tokyo-based company, known as Tepco, consumed 85,000
kiloliters of crude oil at its thermal power plants last month,
up from 58,000 kiloliters a year earlier, it  said  on its
website. Fuel-oil consumption rose to 120,000 kiloliters from
85,000 kiloliters.  The combined capacity of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi and
Fukushima Dai-Ni nuclear plants, which were crippled by the
quake and ensuing tsunami, is 9,096 megawatts, or 14 percent of
the company’s total, according to Tepco.  The following table shows Tokyo Electric’s consumption and
intakes of fuel oil, crude, liquefied natural gas and coal for
January. For fuel oil and crude, the volume is in kiloliters
while LNG and coal are in metric tons.
