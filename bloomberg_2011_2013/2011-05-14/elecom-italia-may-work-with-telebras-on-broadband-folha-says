Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) ’s Chief Executive
Officer Franco Bernabe proposed to the Brazilian government to
partner with Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA on the country’s
broadband plan,  Folha de S. Paulo  reported.  Telecom Italia’s proposal to the government included
offering broadband access to Brazilian users at a lower price
than the 35 reais ($21) per month set by the government, Folha
said, citing Bernabe.  Brazil’s government chose state-controlled Telecomunicacoes
Brasileiras, known as Telebras, in August 2010 to provide high-
speed Internet access in more than 4,000 cities by 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
