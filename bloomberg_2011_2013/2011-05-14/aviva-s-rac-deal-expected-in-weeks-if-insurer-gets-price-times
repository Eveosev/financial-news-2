Aviva Plc’s sale of its RAC roadside
recovery service unit may occur within weeks if the insurer gets
the right price, the London-based  Times  reported, citing an
unidentified source.  JPMorgan Cazenove was appointed last month to examine the
sale to private equity firms which include  BC Partners , Dublier
& Rice LLC and  Carlyle Group , the newspaper said. Aviva is yet
to finally approve the sale, with its agreement dependent on
price, according to the report.  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
