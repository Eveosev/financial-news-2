The  Memphis  Grizzlies defeated the
Oklahoma City Thunder 95-83 to force their National Basketball
Association conference series to a seventh and decided game.  The series will be decided tomorrow in Oklahoma City, with
the winner to meet the  Dallas Mavericks  in the Western
Conference final.  “ I feel good, but the job ain’t done yet,” said Zach Randolph, who scored a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds for
the Grizzlies. “We know it’s going to be tough going to
Oklahoma trying to win that game.”  O.J. Mayo added 16 points for the Grizzlies last night at
FedEx Forum in Memphis.  Russell Westbrook scored 27 points and James Harden added
14 for the Thunder.  Kevin Durant  had a post-season low 11 points.  “It’s going to be a tough Game 7 at our place,” Durant
told reporters. “I’m looking forward to it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
