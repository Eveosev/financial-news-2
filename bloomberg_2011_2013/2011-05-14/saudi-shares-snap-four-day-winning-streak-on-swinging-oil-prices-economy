Saudi Arabian shares dropped the most
in a week, snapping four days of gains, on concern that swinging
oil prices will affect the economy of the world’s largest crude
exporter.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker and  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest
publicly traded lender by market value, led the losses.  The 146-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.1
percent, the measure’s first loss since May 7, to 6,713.63 at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh.  “Fluctuations in oil prices have increased market
volatility in recent sessions,” said Amro Halwani, a senior
trader at Shuaa Capital PSC in Riyadh. “This has led investors
to be cautious as they watch headlines closely for trading cues,
especially from Europe.”  Oil in New York climbed as much as 1.8 percent and dropped
as much as 1.9 percent yesterday. The contract has traded in a
$20.20 range over the past two weeks. Crude oil for June
delivery increased 0.7 percent to $99.65 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. Prices advanced 2.5 percent
this week and are up more than a third in the past year. Saudi
Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Sabic declined 0.9 percent to 108.25 riyals, the lowest
price since May 8.  Al Rajhi  dropped 0.3 percent to 75.50 riyals.
 Sahara Petrochemical Co. (SPC)  weakened 2.6 percent, the largest drop
since May 7, to 24 riyals.  “Retail investor focus has shifted to locally driven mid
caps with lower correlation to international markets,” said
Halwani. “This will remain the theme of the market until the
volatility settles.”  Saudi Automotive Services Co. jumped 3.5 percent, the
biggest gain since May 2, to 14.95 riyals. The company that
operates service stations and restaurants has added 43 service
locations in the kingdom and now has 93 locations, including 26
under construction, it said.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
