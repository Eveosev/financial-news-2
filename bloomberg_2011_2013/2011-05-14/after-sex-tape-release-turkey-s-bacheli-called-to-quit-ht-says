A group that released sex videos,
which led to the resignation of four Turkish Nationalist Action
Party politicians gave the party’s leader Devlet Bahceli until
May 18 to resign, according to  Haberturk  newspaper.  The group, calling itself ‘Different Nationalism,’ sent the
demand by e-mail and on Twitter yesterday after the website it
used to post the videos was shut by  Turkey ’s communications
agency in Ankara, the newspaper said.  Bahceli should resign by 10 a.m. on May 18 or it would
release more videos, Haberturk cited the group as saying. It
wanted the party, which is fighting to win the 10 percent of
votes necessary to enter parliament under Turkish election laws,
to regroup and enter the June 12 general elections “completely
clean and strong” under a new leadership.  The party’s candidates Recai Yildirim, Metin Cobanoglu,
Bulent Didinmez and Ihsan Barutcu resigned after sex videos were
anonymously posted on the internet.  Gokcen Konca, an Ankara-based spokeswoman for the MHP, as
the party is known, declined to comment. Huseyin Ozturk, a
bodyguard for deputy party leader Oktay Vural, who answered a
call to him said the politician had no comment on the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
