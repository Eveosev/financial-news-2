U.S. stocks declined, giving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index a second straight weekly loss, as
concern over Europe’s debt crisis deepened and inflation reports
spurred speculation global  interest rates  will rise.  Citigroup Inc. (C) , the most-traded U.S. stock in 2011, led
financial shares in the S&P 500 to the biggest drop among 10
industries, falling 8.1 percent after a 1-for-10 reverse split.
 Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold
Inc. (FCX)  slumped at least 3.7 percent as data from China increased
expectations for higher interest rates.  Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) 
plunged 11 percent, more than any other S&P 500 company, after
saying its chief executive officer will retire.  The S&P 500 lost 0.2 percent to 1,337.77 this week,
including the biggest one-day decline since March. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 42.99 points, or 0.3 percent, to
12,595.75. The Dow fell during the first two weeks of a month
for the first time since July 2009.  “It’s a very volatile period,” said Peter Tuz, president
of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, which
manages $1.5 billion. “We’re driven by the statistic of the day
now that earnings season is over, and even when it’s positive,
it may not be as positive as expected. I wouldn’t be surprised
if the market stays flat for a while.”  The  S&P 500  has advanced 6.4 percent in 2011 after 72
percent of its companies that reported first-quarter results
since April 11 topped the average analyst earnings projection.
The index had fallen to 1,256.88 on March 16, below the
measure’s Dec. 31 level, amid concern that Japan’s earthquake
and tsunami would curb global demand.  Oil Falls  Oil fell below $100 a barrel this week, down from its
intraday high of $114.83 this month. Raw-material companies in
the S&P 500 had the second-biggest drop behind financials this
week, as data showed inflation in China stayed above the
government’s target, stoking concern about further monetary
tightening that may curb demand. Chinese inflation remained
higher than 5 percent in April and lending exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Cliffs Natural Resources, an iron-ore producer, slipped the
most in a group of 30 materials companies in the S&P 500,
falling 5.1 percent. Freeport-McMoRan lost 3.8 percent, adding
to its 8.8 percent decline the week before.  Energy stocks in the S&P 500 slid 1.4 percent.  Peabody
Energy Corp. (BTU) , a coal producer, lost about 6 percent to $58.45
after falling four straight days.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ,  Consol Energy
Inc. (CNX)  and  Massey Energy Co. (MEE)  all slumped at least 3.7 percent.  Citigroup, JPMorgan  Citigroup lost 8.1 percent to $41.53, the biggest weekly
slump since May 2010. The bank accounted for 6 percent of U.S.
trading this year through last week, Bloomberg data show.
Financial shares in the S&P 500 declined 2.1 percent for the
biggest drop since February.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  lost the most
in the Dow, retreating 4.2 percent to $43.15.  H&R Block Inc. (HRB)  fell 8.2 percent to $15.82. Mortgage-bond
holders are organizing to force repurchases of soured loans by
H&R Block’s Option One Mortgage Corp. unit, according to a
Dallas lawyer who is helping coordinate the effort.  The S&P 500 has climbed 28 percent since Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled in August that he would buy
more bonds to stimulate the economy. The Fed’s second program of
quantitative easing, or QE2, which was officially announced in
November, ends in June. With earnings season over, investors are
more focused on how the end of the bond-buying program will
affect equities, said Tuz.  Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co.’s  Jeremy Grantham  said
he’s growing more bearish on U.S. stocks.  ‘Lighten Up’  “Lighten up on risk-taking,” Grantham, the chief
investment strategist for Boston-based Grantham Mayo Van
Otterloo & Co., which manages more than $108 billion, wrote in a
report this week. The S&P 500 “may still get to 1,500 before
October, but I doubt it, especially without a QE3,” he wrote.
“And whether it will reach 1,500 or not, the environment has
simply become too risky.”  Boston Scientific lost 11 percent, the most since October
2009. The second-biggest maker of implanted heart devices said
Ray Elliott will retire as CEO at the end of 2011. Elliott, 61,
served as president and CEO for less than two years and presided
over a period of stagnant revenue as demand waned for the
company’s heart stents and pacemakers. He said in February that
2011 would be a “difficult” year for Boston Scientific as
economic pressures continued to curb sales.  Yahoo! Inc. fell five straight days as signs of tension
with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. raised speculation it may
benefit less from part ownership of  China ’s largest e-commerce
provider. The shares lost 11 percent to $16.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
