President  Dmitry Medvedev  reiterated
today that Russia should be accepted as an equal partner in a
missile-defense system planned by the U.S. and its European
allies.  The European anti-missile defense shield will only be
“truly efficient and viable” if Russia takes an equal part,
the Kremlin press service said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing Medvedev’s message to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization-Russia Council. The defense system must not be
targeted against either of the parties, Medvedev said.  In November, Russia offered at the NATO summit in Lisbon to
take part in the missile-defense system, with the proviso on
partnership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
