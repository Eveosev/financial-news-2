Wolfgang Koehler, a board member of
DZ Bank AG, said that the incoming capital-buffer requirements
of the Basel III agreement will hurt profitability in the

buffers would cause a “considerable restructuring” of
liquidity portfolios at DZ and many other banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
