Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  shut dock
operations at its refinery in Baton Rouge as the Mississippi
River rose, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman said.  The refinery, located on the banks of the river, continues
to operate and produce products, Allexon, who is based in
Fairfax, Virginia said in an e-mail today.  “We have no plans to shut down the complex at this time,”
Allexon said. “We will, of course, continue monitoring river
conditions and will make operational adjustments as conditions
require.”  For weeks, the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, swollen by
heavy rain and melted snow, have been inundating cities and
towns, flooding cropland and disrupting shipping.  The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S. after
Exxon’s refinery in Baytown,  Texas , can process 525,000 barrels
of oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company’s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the  North
Sea , West Africa,  South America , Central America and the Arabian
Gulf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
