A Minsk court sentenced Andrei Sannikov, Belarus’ opposition candidate in December’s
presidential elections, to five years in prison, the state-run
news service Belta reported today.  Sannikov and four others were found guilty of organizing
protests after the Dec. 19 vote. They will serve their terms in
a high-security prison, the news service said.  More than 700 people, including Sannikov and other
opposition presidential candidates, were arrested after protests
in Minsk following the election in which Alexander Lukashenko
was declared to have won a fourth term in office with almost 80
percent of the vote.  Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994 under a regime
dubbed the “last dictatorship in  Europe ” by the U.S, had vowed
to punish protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
