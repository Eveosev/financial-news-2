A 12-year-old Ugandan girl died in a
new outbreak of the  Ebola  virus in Zirobwe, 40 miles north of
the capital, Kampala on May 6, the African nation’s health
ministry said.  The government is monitoring people who came into contact
with the girl to try to contain the hemorrhagic disease, the
ministry said in a statement today. It restarted an ebola
taskforce and will source the drugs to stop the outbreak, it
said.  Ebola killed 30 of 116 people infected during an outbreak
in the East African country’s western Bundibugyo district in
2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
