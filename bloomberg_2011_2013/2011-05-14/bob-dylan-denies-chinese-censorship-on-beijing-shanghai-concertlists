Bob Dylan  denied that he was censored
by Chinese authorities in a tour last month and was never
refused permission to perform in the country, the folk singer
wrote on his official  website .  “The Chinese government had asked for the names of the
songs that I would be playing,” he said in the statement posted
yesterday. “If there were any songs, verses or lines censored,
nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we
intended to play.”  Dylan said the Chinese authorities were unaware of reports
that the Ministry of Culture refused him permission to play. He
held one show in Beijing and another in  Shanghai  in his first
tour of the country.  The Sunday Morning Post reported April 4 that Dylan had
canceled legs of his Asian tour after authorities banned the
concerts. The newspaper cited the promoter’s chief of
operations, Jeffrey Wu.  Dylan said his band went to  China  with a different
promoter.  -- Editors: Raj Rajendran, Gordon Bell  To contact the reporter on this story:
