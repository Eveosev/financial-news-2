The U.K. government is to sell some
of its wine cellar, which includes 10,000 pound ($16,180)
bottles of Chateau Latour, to reduce the drinks bill for state
banquets, the  Financial Times  reported.  The income raised from the more expensive vintages will be
used to replenish stocks with younger varieties in a bid to make
the cellar self-financing, the FT said, citing the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office.  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
