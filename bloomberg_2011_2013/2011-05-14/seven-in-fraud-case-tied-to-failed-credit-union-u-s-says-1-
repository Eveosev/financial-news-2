A federal grand jury in  Cleveland 
issued a 22-count indictment against six people in connection
with a fraud against Ohio’s failed St. Paul Croatian Federal
Credit Union, whose collapse resulted in $170 million in losses,
the U.S.  Justice Department  said.  The indictment alleges that Anthony Raguz, the credit
union’s former chief operating officer, helped facilitate $4.5
million in loans from 2006 to 2009 to an individual who used the
money to pay for gambling excursions and renovations of a bar
and grill, the agency said today in an e-mailed statement. The
man and others were charged with bank fraud and  money
laundering , according to the statement.  A related indictment alleges that another Ohio man
fraudulently obtained $1. 6 million in loans from the credit
union with the chief operating officer’s help. Both borrowers
paid the executive a total of $200,000 for his help, prosecutors
said.  St. Paul Croatian Federal Credit Union in Eastlake,  Ohio ,
went into conservatorship and then forced liquidation in April,
resulting in $170 million in losses to the National Credit Union
Share Insurance Fund, one of the worst failures in history, the
Justice Department said.  John Pyle, a lawyer for Raguz, didn’t immediately respond
to a voice-mail seeking comment after regular business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
