France ’s Radical party, led by former
French energy minister Jean-Louis Borloo, voted to split from
the governing UMP party,  Le Parisien  reported, citing Borloo.  The Radical party had been associated with the UMP since
its creation in 2002, according to the French daily newspaper.
Members of the party today also formally requested that Borloo
run for president next year, Le Parisien said.  Borloo is considering whether to run as candidate for the
2012 French presidential elections, the daily newspaper  Le
Figaro  reported earlier today, citing the former minister. It’s
a decision that “cannot be taken lightly,” Borloo was cited as
saying. Borloo said he will decide “before the autumn,”
according to Le Figaro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
