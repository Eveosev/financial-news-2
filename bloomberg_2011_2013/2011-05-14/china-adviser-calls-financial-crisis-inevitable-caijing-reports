Financial crisis is “inevitable”
for developing countries in the next five to 10 years, Caijing
reported today, citing China central bank adviser  Li Daokui .  Developing countries like India and Brazil face fiscal
deficits and problems that will emerge eventually, Caijing said,
citing Li. China will play a very important role in the world’s
financial system and be able to avoid the crisis as its status
is different from most developed and developing countries, Li
said. The  U.S. dollar , euro and Japanese yen will face
depreciation pressures for the long term, Li added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
