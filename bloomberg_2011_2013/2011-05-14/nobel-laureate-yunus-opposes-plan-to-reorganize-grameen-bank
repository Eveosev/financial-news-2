Nobel Laureate  Muhammad Yunus , who
resigned as managing director of  Bangladesh ’s Grameen Bank, said
a proposal by a government panel to reorganize the microlender
will harm the institution.  The government should leave the selection of the lender’s
chairman to its board, he said today in an e-mailed statement
addressed to his ex-colleagues. Yunus stepped down from Dhaka-
based  Grameen Bank  yesterday, after the nation’s  Supreme Court 
dismissed his appeal to stay at the helm of the bank he founded.  “If Grameen Bank comes under the direct or indirect
control of the government, then politics will rear its head” at
the lender, Yunus said. “I hope that there won’t be any attempt
to transform Grameen Bank, a bank that is owned by the poor,
into something completely different.”  A government committee made a proposal on May 12 to make
changes in the way Grameen Bank is managed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
