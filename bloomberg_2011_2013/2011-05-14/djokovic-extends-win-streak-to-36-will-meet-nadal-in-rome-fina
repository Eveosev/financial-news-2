Novak Djokovic will attempt to extend
his unbeaten tennis-season start to 37 matches today after
yesterday earning a third-set tiebreaker win over  Andy Murray  in
the semifinals of the Internazionali BNL d’Italia in Rome.  Djokovic, the second seed, beat No. 4 Murray of Britain 6-1,
3-6, 7-6 (7-2). The Serb will now take on top-ranked Rafael Nadal of  Spain , who defeated Richard Gasquet of France 7-5, 6-1,
in the final.  Djokovic, 23, has won six straight tournaments to open the
2011 season, and his streak is second only to John McEnroe, who
started 42-0 in 1984. During the stretch, the Serb has beaten
Nadal three times, including the Spaniard’s first clay-court
loss in almost two years last week in Madrid.  The record for consecutive victories is 46, set by
Guillermo Vilas of  Argentina  in 1977.  To contact the reporter on this story:
