Taiwan’s government plans to sell
NT$275 billion ($9.5 billion) of bonds in the next three months,
22.2 percent more than it raised in the first quarter of 2012.  The 19 bond sales planned for the next 12 months include a
NT$40 billion allocation of 15-year notes on Jan. 9, after a
Jan. 4 auction, the Ministry of Finance said Dec. 22 in a
statement on its website. First-quarter issuance will also
include NT$40 billion of five-year securities being auctioned on
Jan. 10, NT$40 billion of 20-year notes on Jan. 23, NT$40
billion of 2-year bonds on Feb. 5, and NT$30 billion of 35-year
bonds on Feb. 22. The ministry said it will auction NT$40
billion of 10-year securities on March 1, and NT$40 billion of
20-year notes on March 18.  Taiwan was said to keep debt issuance in 2013 similar to
this year’s NT$656 billion, according to two people who were
invited to a meeting with the central bank and Ministry of
Finance on Dec 14. The Treasury administration forecast future
yearly sales will “frequently” exceed NT$610 billion,
according to dealers invited to attend the meeting. The people
asked not to be identified because they weren’t authorized to
speak publicly.  The island is poised to sell more than NT$600 billion of
bonds for the fourth year, with its  percentage  to gross domestic
product rising from 27.9 percent at the end of 2007 to 34.7
percent in this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Cabinet said on Nov. 22 it plans to raise the debt ceiling
to 50 percent of GDP from 48 percent of gross national product.  Government securities  were little changed before the
announcement. The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds
due September 2022 was at 1.15 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. Benchmark 10-year yields fell 14 basis points
this year.  The  finance ministry  said it will also sell NT$65 billion
of Treasury bills, securities with maturities of less than two
years, in the coming quarter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
