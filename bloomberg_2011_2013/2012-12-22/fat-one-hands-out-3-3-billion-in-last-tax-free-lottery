Spain’s Christmas lottery, which has
one of the world’s largest jackpots, handed out 2.5 billion
euros ($3.3 billion) in prizes today in the country’s last tax-
free draw.  Ticket sales fell 8 percent from a year earlier, according
to Loterias y Apuestas del Estado. Still, 2.5 billion euros of
tickets were sold, or more than 50 euros per citizen.  Spain’s government plans to introduce a 20 percent tax on
lottery winnings next year as part of efforts to mend public
finances battered by a five-year economic slump and 26 percent
unemployment rate. Prizes have traditionally been tax-free in
Spain, where the government runs the 250-year-old operator.  The top prize, known as El Gordo, or the Fat One, is worth
4 million euros, although people tend to split each ticket into
10 strips, which they buy for 20 euros each. The lottery is a
traditional part of the build-up to Christmas, as office
workers, friends and neighbors pool funds to share tickets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
