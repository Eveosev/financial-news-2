Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta
said the country’s newly-approved government, which won a
confidence vote in Parliament yesterday, is “a good signal”
for the currency, the leu.  Ponta said in a public government meeting in Bucharest
today that the leu has strengthened to an almost seven-month
high because of “improved perception of political stability”
in the country after the ruling coalition won a two-thirds
majority in Dec. 9 elections.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
