South Korean rapper Psy’s “Gangnam
Style” has become the first video to reach one billion views on
 Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s YouTube website.  The  video , which contains satirical lyrics about the habits
of wealthy South Koreans and features choreography mimicking
horse riding, passed 1 billion views on Dec. 21, just over five
months after debuting, YouTube said on its official  blogpost .
The video had 1.004 billion views as of 8:57 a.m. in Seoul.
“Gangnam Style” passed Justin Bieber’s “Baby” on Nov. 24, to
become the most-viewed on YouTube.  The popularity of the video has vaulted 34-year-old
musician Park Jae Sang to fame under the pseudonym Psy, earning
the rapper appearances on U.S. television programs including
“The Ellen DeGeneres Show” and NBC’s “Today Show.”  YG Entertainment Inc. (122870) , which manages Psy, gained 1 percent
to 57,700 won yesterday in  Seoul , extending this year’s gain to
57 percent compared with the 22 percent slump by the Kosdaq
Index, where the company is listed.  Calls to YG Entertainment’s Seoul office made outside
regular business hours were connected to an automatic response
system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
