Saudi Arabian stocks rose to the
highest level in six weeks as telecommunications companies
rallied after a report showed Internet usage in the country
increased this year.  The Tadawul All-Share Index increased 0.2 percent to
6,902.53, the highest since Nov. 10, at the close in  Riyadh 
after declining as much as 0.6 percent in earlier trading. The
benchmark gauge for the Arab world’s biggest bourse has gained
7.6 percent this year.  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC) , the kingdom’s largest mobile-phone
service provider, rose to the highest level since Oct. 20.
 Etihad Etisalat Co. (EEC) , the second-largest phone company, advanced
the most in two weeks. Saudi Arabia had 15.2 million  Internet
users  at the end of the third quarter, compared with 13.6
million at the end of 2011, the Communications and Information
Technology Commission said in a quarterly statement today.  “This is a surprise move mainly supported by the telecom
sector,” said Mohammed Al-Omran, financial analyst and
president of the Gulf Center for Financial Consultancy in
Riyadh. “The telecommunications report that came out gave a
boost to the sector and subsequently the index.”  Mobile-phone users at the end of the quarter were 53.1
million, the regulator said.  Saudi Telecom gained 0.7 percent to 43.1 riyals, while
Etihad Etisalat rose 1.7 percent to 76 riyals.  Bank Albilad (ALBI) 
climbed 3.1 percent to 29.9 riyals, the highest level since
Sept. 15.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
