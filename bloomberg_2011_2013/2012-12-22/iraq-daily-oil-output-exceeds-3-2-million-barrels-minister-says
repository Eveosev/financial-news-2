Iraqi  crude  production will exceed
3.2 million barrels a day in December, Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul
Kareem al-Luaibi said today in Cairo.  That compares with output of 3.17 million barrels a day in
November, according to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries’ last monthly report.  Iraq  has risen this year to the rank of OPEC’s second-
biggest producer. Its output may gain to 3.7 million barrels a
day next year and 4 million barrels in 2014, according to the
minister.  “We have an ambitious plan to develop the oil industry,”
al-Luaibi said.  OPEC will decide on a successor to Secretary-General
Abdalla El-Badri by May, al-Luaibi said. El-Badri’s term was
extended by one year to the end of 2013 earlier this month when
OPEC ministers failed to agree on a successor.  Iraq, which had backed former Oil Minister  Thamir Ghadhban ,
is sticking to its candidate, al-Luaibi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
