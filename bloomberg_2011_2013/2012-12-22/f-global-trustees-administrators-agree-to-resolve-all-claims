The trustee liquidating the failed
MF Global Inc. brokerage reached an agreement with the
administrator of MF Globalâ€™s U.K. unit to resolve all claims
between the entities.  The agreement calls for $500 million to $600 million to be
returned to MF Global from the U.K. unit, depending on the final
payout from the U.K. client money and creditor estates, the
companies said in a statement. Spokesman  Kent Jarrell  said they
were originally seeking $700 million.  Trustee James W. Giddens has filed for approval of the
agreement with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  In addition, Giddens and Louis J. Freeh, Chapter 11 trustee
for  MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MFGLQ) , agreed to resolve all claims
between their respective estates.  Giddens has paid U.S. and foreign customers about $4.9
billion since the firm failed 13 months ago, and has $1.2
billion in hand, out of $1.4 billion in remaining assets,
according to data through Oct. 31 included in a report filed in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
