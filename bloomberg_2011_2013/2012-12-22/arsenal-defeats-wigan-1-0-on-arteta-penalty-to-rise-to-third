Captain  Mikel Arteta  scored a
second-half penalty to give Arsenal a 1-0 victory at Wigan to
move the Gunners into third place of English soccer’s Premier
League.  Jean Beausejour brought down Theo Walcott in the Wigan area
and Arteta converted the penalty kick in the 60th minute. Wigan
appealed for a handball a few minutes from the final whistle at
the DW Stadium, but were turned down by referee Jon Moss.  The victory -- Arsenal’s third in a row -- pushes the
Gunners into third place after 18 games with 30 points, one more
than Chelsea, which has played two fewer matches, meets  Aston
Villa  tomorrow. Tottenham, which hosts Stoke today, has 29
points after 17 games.  Wigan has lost six of its last eight matches, and are in
18th place, sitting in the relegation zone for the third
straight Christmas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
