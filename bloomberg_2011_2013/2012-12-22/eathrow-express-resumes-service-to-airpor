London  Heathrow airport ’s main rail
link to the U.K. capital is operating normally, even as flooding
on lines in the southwest of England has left train operators
advising customers not to travel.  Heathrow Express trains, which depart for  Europe ’s busiest
airport every 15 minutes, are running after shutting yesterday
because of equipment damage, Marianna Panizza, a spokeswoman for
Heathrow Airport, said by telephone. The slower Heathrow Connect
services are also functioning, according to the train operator’s
website.  Heavy rain has left tracks between Taunton and Plymouth
flooded, meaning no trains can run between the two stations,
James Davies, a spokesman for train operator First Great
Western, said by phone.  While replacement bus services between the two stations are
in operation, they are likely to be busy, Davies said. Given the
possibility of further disruption to road links, First Great
Western is advising passengers not to travel. Passengers can use
tickets for travel today on services tomorrow, he said.  Arriva Trains Wales is also advising customers not to
travel where possible, the company said on Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
