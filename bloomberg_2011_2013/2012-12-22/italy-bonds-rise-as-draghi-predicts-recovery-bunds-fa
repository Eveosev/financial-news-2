Italian 10-year bonds rose this
week, with the yield falling to a two-week low, after European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said reforms in the euro
area have revived confidence that will help foster a recovery.  Spanish 10-year bonds climbed for a second week as
borrowing costs fell at an auction of 3.52 billion euros ($4.65
billion) of bills. German bunds dropped after data showed
business confidence in the nation increased for a second month
in December, undermining demand for the euro region’s safest
fixed-income assets.  Greece ’s 10-year bonds advanced for a
seventh week after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the country’s credit
rating.  “The general perception that the worst is over is
something that is supporting  market sentiment  and higher-
yielding euro-area assets,” said Anders Moeller Lumholtz, a
Copenhagen-based analyst at  Danske Bank A/S. (DANSKE)  “The confidence
data confirmed the perception that we have seen a bottom in the
euro-area economic cycle.”  Italian 10-year yields declined 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, this week to 4.47 percent at 5 p.m. in  London 
yesterday. The rate fell to 4.35 percent on Dec. 19, the  lowest 
since Dec. 3, 2010. The 5.5 percent bond maturing in November
2022 rose 1.045, or 10.45 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to
108.51.  Spanish Sale  The rate on similar-maturity Spanish bonds declined 14
basis points to 5.25 percent and dropped to 5.20 percent on Dec.
20, the least since Dec. 3.  Spain  sold three-month bills at an average yield of 1.195
percent on Dec. 18, down from 1.254 percent at a previous
auction on Nov. 27, and six-month securities at 1.609 percent,
compared with 1.669 percent last month.  “The impression that one has of this year, at least of the
second part of this year, is of a gradual improvement in
financing conditions which is one of the reasons why we foresee
a beginning of a recovery in the second part of next year,”
Draghi said in testimony at the European Parliament’s Economic
and Monetary Affairs Committee on Dec. 18. Recent economic
“indicators have stabilized at low levels.”  Germany ’s Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, improved to 102.4 from 101.4 in
November, according to data released on Dec. 19. Economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News  predicted an increase to 102.  German  10-year yields  climbed three basis points this week
to 1.38 percent.  Greece Upgrade  S&P on Dec. 18 raised Greece’s credit rating to B- from
selective default after a bond buyback earlier this month helped
reduce the country’s debt burden.  Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras called the upgrade a
“great success” for his country, which has received 240
billion euros of loan pledges from the euro area and
 International Monetary Fund  in two bailouts since May 2010.  “The Greek upgrade did spur a move lower in Greece’s
yields,” said  Peter Chatwell , a strategist at Credit Agricole
Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “As people try and look
ahead to next year, the market is reevaluating periphery debt.”  Greece’s 10-year rate dropped 1.13 percentage points this
week to 11.90 percent, and fell to as low as 11.20 percent
yesterday, the least since the nation’s debt restructuring in
March.  Euro-region government bond markets will be closed from
Dec. 24 through Dec. 26, according to the  website  of Eurex, a
derivatives exchange unit of Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG.  German bunds returned 3.8 percent this year through Dec.
20, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian debt earned
21 percent while Spanish bonds gained 6.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
