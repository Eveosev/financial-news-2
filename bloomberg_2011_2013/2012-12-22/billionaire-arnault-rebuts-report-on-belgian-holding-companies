French billionaire Bernard Arnault,
chief executive of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , rebutted
a report that he has located parts of his business empire in
 Belgium  in order to escape taxes in  France .  LVMH and Arnault’s companies pursue “entirely real
economic activities in Belgium, where some have been located for
several decades,” LVMH said in an e-mailed statement. “All of
their activities are entirely in line in particular with the tax
laws of the Kingdom of Belgium and with international law.”  Earlier today, Belgian newspapers  De Tijd  and  L’Echo 
published a joint report that Arnault operates “letter-box
companies” in Belgium worth 7 billion euros ($9 billion) in
order to avoid French capital-gains and inheritance taxes.  Arnault, 63, said in September that he was applying for
Belgian citizenship for “personal” reasons. While he vowed to
continue paying taxes in France, his move sparked criticism from
Socialist President Francois Hollande and his government.  Arnault “remains a French resident,” according to the
LVMH statement.  John Crombez, a Belgian state secretary in charge of the
fight against fraud, told De Tijd that Belgium should hand the
Arnault tax case to the French authorities. Belgian Finance
Minister Steven Vanackere declined to comment on individual tax
cases, the newspaper said.  “If  Bernard Arnault  is working in Belgium with truly
letter-box companies, this has to be signaled to the French tax
authorities,” Crombez told De Tijd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
