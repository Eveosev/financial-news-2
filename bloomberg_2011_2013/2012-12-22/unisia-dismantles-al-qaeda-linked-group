Tunisia  arrested 16 members of a
group linked to al-Qaeda and security forces are pursuing other
suspected militants hiding near the country’s western border
with Algeria, the nation’s top security official said.  The arrests announced late yesterday by Interior Minister
Ali Larayedh came after security forces raided a training camp
in the mountains near the city of Kasserine, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Tunis.  Authorities are seeking those responsible for an attack in
Tunisia earlier this month that left a policeman dead. Eight
people were detained in Kasserine, he said. They belonged to a
group headed by three Algerians linked to al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb.  “It’s a terrorist group in the formative stage,” said
Larayedh. The groups were involved in training young Tunisians,
some of whom would be sent to Libya and  Algeria , he said.  Authorities found explosives, military uniforms, maps,
ammunition, and coded documents.  A second group of suspects was arrested in another forested
region of northern Tunisian, he said.  Tunisia’s Islamist-led troika government has been
struggling with a small Salafist undercurrent blamed for the
September attack on the U.S. embassy and nearby international
school, as well as a spate of burnings of stores selling
alcohol. The Salafis, who espouse an ultraconservative
interpretation of Islam, want to impose Islamic law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
