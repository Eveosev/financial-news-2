London police handed a file to
prosecutors after considering whether potential offenses were
committed when Sydney radio presenters made a hoax call to a
hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated.  Southern Cross Media Group Ltd. (SXL)  canceled the Hot 30 show
that aired the prank call on Dec. 10 after Jacintha Saldanha, a
nurse who answered the phone at the hospital, was found dead.  “Officers have liaised with the  Crown Prosecution Service 
as to whether any criminal offenses had been committed in
relation to the hoax call made to King Edward VII Hospital in
the early hours of Tuesday, Dec. 4,” the Metropolitan Police
said today in an e-mailed statement. “We are not prepared to
discuss further.” The case was referred to the CPS on Dec. 19.  For the hoax, radio hosts Mel Greig and Michael Christian
impersonated  Queen Elizabeth II  and Prince Charles in the call
seeking details about the health of the former  Kate Middleton ,
the pregnant wife of Charles’s son William, the second in line
to the British throne.  To contact the reporter on this story:
