Luol Deng  recorded a season-high 29
points and 13 rebounds as the Chicago Bulls defeated the New
York Knicks 110-106 in a National Basketball Association contest
marred by 50 personal fouls, nine technicals and four ejections.  Carmelo Anthony,  Tyson Chandler  and coach  Mike Woodson  of
the Knicks and the Bulls’ Joakim Noah were thrown out in the
fourth quarter last night at Madison Square Garden in New York.  Marco Belinelli had 22 points and Kirk Hinrich added 16 for
the Bulls, who lead the Eastern Conference’s Central Division
with a 15-10 record. New York, at 19-7, remains atop the
conference’s Atlantic Division.  The Bulls had a 54-39 lead at halftime before the Knicks
rallied to outscore Chicago 67-56 in the second half.  Anthony scored 29 points, reserve J.R. Smith had 29 points
and 10 rebounds, while  Raymond Felton  added 21 for the Knicks,
who took their second home loss of the season.  Anthony and Woodson received technical fouls for arguing
with officials before Chandler and Noah got into an altercation,
drawing technicals that led to their ejections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
