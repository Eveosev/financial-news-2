Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  is
targeting Barcelona striker  David Villa  in the January signing
period as the English Premier League coach tries to improve his
team’s attack, the Daily Mail said.  The Gunners are looking to bring the 31-year-old Spaniard
in on loan, but would consider a long-term contract if he can be
signed cheaply, the newspaper said. Villa isn’t playing much and
Barcelona may allow him to leave if he gets frustrated, the Mail
said. Klass-Jan Huntelaar, Adrian Lopez and Edin Dzeko are also
options for the London team, the newspaper said.  Wenger is also looking to bring in a goalkeeper to compete
with Wojciech Szczesny and is aiming for Sunderland’s Simon
Mignolet, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
