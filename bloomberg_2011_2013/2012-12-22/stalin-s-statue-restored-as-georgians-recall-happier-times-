Villagers in  Georgia  have restored a
statue commemorating Josef Stalin, with residents of his birth
town of Gori also considering plans to rebuild a monument to the
former Soviet dictator.  The statue, which was removed last year, was reinstated in
a ceremony yesterday in Alvani, in the Akhmeta region north-east
of the capital Tbilisi. Villagers gave speeches, recited poems
and talked of “happier times” during Stalin’s reign.  Stalin remains a divisive figure in his birthplace, with
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili having denounced statues
of the Second World War leader as a reminder of the Soviet
Union’s control of Georgia. Saakashvili’s party was unexpectedly
defeated by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili’s opposition
coalition in October. Ivanishvili has expressed willingness to
improve ties with  Russia .  “Long live Stalin, he liberated us from fascism and
improved Georgians’ lives, while Saakashvili’s government did
nothing but destroy the economic glory of Georgia,” Grisha
Oniani, an entrepreneur who is collecting Stalinist memorabilia,
told a crowd in Alvani.  The Stalin statue was removed from Gori in 2010. Georgia’s
parliament voted to ban Soviet symbols in 2011, 20 years after
the country declared independence from the Soviet Union. Georgia
and Russia fought a five-day war over the breakaway region of
South Ossetia in 2008 and relations between the two countries
remain tense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
