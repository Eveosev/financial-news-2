U.K. government bonds fell for a
second week as  Bank of England ’s minutes showed all except one
policy maker was against boosting debt purchases and inflation
stayed at the fastest since May.  Benchmark 10-year securities slid for eighth day through
Dec. 19, the longest losing streak since February 2011, as signs
the euro-area debt crisis was easing, undermined demand for the
relative safety of gilts. Investors boosted their expectations
for inflation to the most in eight months, bond trading showed.
The pound was little changed this week after rising a three-
month high against the dollar.  “The minutes and inflation data suggested the chance for
another round of quantitative easing is pretty low,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in  London , referring to the central bank’s program of
asset purchases.  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, this week to 1.89 percent at the 5 p.m.
close in London yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 dropped 0.195, or 1.95 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 98.81.  Bank of England policy makers voted 8-1 to leave their
bond-purchase program on hold this month as immediate dangers
from the euro-area crisis receded and near-term inflation risks
persisted, the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee’s Dec.
5-6 meeting released on Dec. 19 showed.  David Miles  dissented
and voted to increase the target by 25 billion pounds to 400
billion pounds.  ‘Immediate Risks’  “The immediate risks emanating from the euro area seemed
less pressing than they had in the summer, and financial-market
sentiment had improved,” the MPC said. It added that inflation
will probably remain above the central bank’s 2 percent target
for the “next year or so.”  Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent last month from a year
earlier, matching October’s level which was the fastest since
May, the  Office for National Statistics  said Dec. 18.  The 10-year  break-even rate , a measure of expectations of
inflation derived from the difference in yield between gilts and
index-linked securities, widened to 2.79 percentage points on
Dec. 19, the most since April 19. It was at 2.71 percentage
points yesterday.  The pound traded at $1.6158 at 5:15 p.m. in London
yesterday after appreciating to $1.6307 on Dec. 19, the
strongest level since Sept. 21. Sterling was little changed this
week at 81.43 pence per euro.  Gilts returned 1.7 percent this year, compared with a 3.8
percent gain from German bonds, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Treasuries gained 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
