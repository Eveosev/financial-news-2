Energy Future Holdings Corp., the
KKR & Co.-backed utility struggling to avoid default, has begun
a $1.4 billion bond exchange to push out maturities as it seeks
to extend the portion of its  credit line  due next year.  Energy Future, formerly known as TXU Corp., proposed
yesterday to exchange as much as $1.3 billion of new 10 percent
senior secured notes due 2020 for existing notes, according to a
regulatory filing. It’s also seeking permission from secured
bondholders to scrap “many of the restrictive covenants” in
the notes’ indentures, according to the filing.  The company also is offering to swap as much as $124
million of unsecured notes due in 2018 in exchange for
obligations due in 2017.  The company is asking lenders to extend until 2016 $645
million of a revolving loan that matures in 2013 at its Texas
Competitive Electric Holdings Co. unit, according to the filing.
One undisclosed lender holding $425 million of the financing
already agreed to the transaction, Dallas-based Energy Future
said in the document.  KKR & Co., TPG Capital and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners
acquired the electric power utility for about $43 billion in
2007 in the largest leveraged buyout ever.  TCEH will add $340 million of term loans if all the
revolving credit commitments due in 2013 are extended, according
to the filing.  ‘Likely’ Default  A default “is highly likely to occur within the next 12
months” at TCEH, Jim Hempstead, senior vice president at
Moody’s Investors Service, wrote in a Dec. 5 report. Energy
Future and the parent of its Oncor Electric Delivery Co. unit
were “increasingly unlikely” to default, he wrote.  Oncor is regulated and distributes power to homes and
businesses, while TCEH operates in the unregulated market and
has suffered from falling natural gas prices that are used to
set the electricity rates  TCEH has $1.3 billion of cash and $114 million of borrowing
capacity left under a letter of credit, according to yesterday’s
filing. It has $700 million of debt maturing in 2013 and $3.9
billion due in 2014, with annual interest payments of $2.7
billion next year and $2.6 billion in the following period.  The unit had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of $1.78 billion in the 12 months through June
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  As part of the loan extension request, Citigroup Inc. will
resign as so-called swingline lender, Energy Future said in the
filing.  Money under a revolving credit line can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
