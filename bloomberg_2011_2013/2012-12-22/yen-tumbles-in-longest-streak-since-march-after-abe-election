The yen fell for a sixth week
against the dollar, the longest streak in nine months, after the
nation’s central bank said it would review its inflation target
after a pro-stimulus government was elected.  Japan ’s currency reached to a 20-month low versus the
greenback after Shinzo Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party  won
parliamentary elections, giving him a mandate to pursue expanded
monetary easing. The  Dollar Index  erased a weekly decline after
House Republican leaders canceled a scheduled vote on Speaker
 John Boehner ’s plan to allow higher tax rates for annual incomes
above $1 million, delaying a deal beyond the Christmas recess.
Sweden’s krona and Norway’s krone rallied after central banks
held policy meetings.  “We are eventually heading toward 100 in dollar-yen and
maybe the other side of it -- that’s how significant this sea
change in Japan is,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic
strategist at  Miller Tabak  in New York. “People will still
believe that something has to give with the fiscal-cliff debate.
I am still banking on strong U.S. growth next year.”  The yen declined 0.9 percent this week to 84.24 yen per
dollar in New York, touching a 20-month low of 84.62 on Dec. 19.
The Japanese currency fell 1.1 percent to 111.08 versus the
euro, its second weekly decline. It reached 112.50 on Dec. 19,
the least since August 2011. The euro rose 0.2 percent to
$1.3188, reaching $1.3308, the strongest since May.  Futures Levels  Bets the yen will decline against dollar  decreased  from the
most since 2007, according to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. Future traders pared net-short yen positions to
89,163 contracts on Dec. 18 from 94,401 the previous week.  Wagers on the euro weakening against the dollar  fell  to
9,736, the least since September 2011.  The South African rand leads all major currencies this
month against the greenback, appreciating 3.7 percent. The yen
has weakned the most out of 16 counterparts versus the dollar,
decreasing 2.1 percent.  South Korea ’s won has appreciated more than all of its
peers versus the dollar this quarter, adding 3.5 percent. The
Norwegian krone has been the second-biggest gainer, increasing
2.7 percent.  Real Weakness  The Brazilian real has lost 10.2 percent versus the dollar
in 2012, while the yen has declined 8.7 percent. The Mexican
peso leads all 16 of the dollar’s biggest peers with a gain of
7.8 percent.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, fell after Boehner, an
 Ohio Republican , said in a statement yesterday his tax measure
“did not have sufficient support from our members to pass.”  The gauge was little changed for the week at 79.538, after
reaching the least since Oct. 18.  “If we discover that Boehner can’t control his base,
markets are not going to like that and it’s risk-off,”  Greg Anderson , the North American head of Group of 10 currency
strategy at Citigroup Inc. in New York said Dec. 20.  The dollar will strengthen to $1.27 per euro by the end of
June, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. The greenback
will trade at 84 yen, a separate survey found.  Krona Rises  Sweden’s krona jumped against all its major counterparts
after the central bank signaled it probably won’t cut  interest
rates  next year, even as it lowered its benchmark Dec. 18.  The krona strengthened 1.7 percent to 8.6420 per euro, and
climbed 1.9 percent to 6.5530 per dollar. The central bank
reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point to
1 percent.  Norway ’s krone was the second-best performer against the
dollar this week, as Norges Bank announced it would keep
interest rates a 1.5 percent. The central bank is trying to
balance rising housing prices without strengthening the krone.  The krone gained 0.8 percent to 5.5747 per dollar after
appreciating to the strongest since October 2011. It fetched
7.3507 per euro, 0.7 percent stronger.  Abe asked BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa to agree to 2
percent inflation target when the two met on Dec. 18. At its
meeting this week, the  Bank of Japan  boosted monetary stimulus
and agreed to review its 1 percent goal.  Japan Outlook  “Fears that the new Abe government is going to announce
something quite drastic are diverting flows into other
currencies,” said  Peter Frank , global head of currency strategy
at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in  London .  Declines in the yen may temper as the 14-day relative
strength index against the dollar touched 25.3, below the 30
level for the eighth day. A reading of 30 or lower indicates an
asset may have fallen too far too quickly. The yen’s relative
strength versus the euro reached 26.9.  The euro was supported this week as  Standard & Poor’s 
lifted  Greece ’s long-term rating to B-, citing the completion of
the nation’s distressed-debt buyback and the determination of
euro-zone  member states  to preserve Greece’s membership in the
currency bloc.  The euro has fallen 1 percent this year against nine-
developed nation currencies, according to the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar has retreated 2.9
percent and Norway’s krone is the best performer with a 4.9
percent advance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
