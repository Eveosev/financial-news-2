Police in New Delhi used water
cannons and tear gas to disperse a protesting crowd demanding
tougher rape laws in  India  as a 23-year old woman battled for
life after she was brutalized in a moving bus on Dec. 16.  Thousands gathered in the vicinity of the presidential
palace in the center of the nation’s capital shouting “We want
justice” as televised images showed some clashing with the
police who used batons to push them back. Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde pledged better safety while the leader of the
opposition in the lower house of parliament, Sushma Swaraj,
called for a special session to discuss violence against women.  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, during a meeting with
Shinde, directed the latter to ensure a sense of security and
prevent recurrence of such incidents, the Press Trust of India
reported today. All six men accused of raping and torturing the
woman over a period of about 45 minutes have been arrested,
Chhaya Sharma, a top New Delhi police official told reporters in
the city today. Some of the protesters demanded the death
penalty for the accused.  Data provided by India’s National Crime Records Bureau show
about 24,200 cases of rape and 228,650 cases of crimes against
women were reported in 2011. Figures given by the United Nations
show 1.8 cases of rape for every 100,000 in India, compared with
63 in  Sweden , 29 in the U.K. and 27 in the U.S. Most cases go
unreported in India.  To contact the reporters on this story:
