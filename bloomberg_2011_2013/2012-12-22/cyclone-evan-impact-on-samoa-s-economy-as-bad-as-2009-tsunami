Samoa ’s economy will be as hard hit
by the passage of Cyclone Evan earlier this month as it was by a
2009 tsunami that destroyed 20 villages and killed  143 people ,
an International Monetary Fund official said.  The category 4 storm, which hit the Pacific island country
Dec. 13, collapsed houses and tourist facilities, washed away
roads and bridges, and damaged crops and water and electricity
infrastructure, the IMF’s resident adviser Yangzheg Yang said in
an  interview  yesterday on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.  The effect would be worse than that of the 2009 tsunami, he
said. That event, sparked by an  magnitude 8.1 earthquake  about
190 kilometers (118 miles) south of the country’s capital, Apia,
displaced 3,500 people and caused damage  estimated at $147
million , equivalent to more than a quarter of the country’s
 gross domestic product .  “It’s pretty horrific,” Yang said. “The impact of this
cyclone is probably just as great, if not bigger, than the
damage caused by the tsunami.”  Cyclone Evan brought winds as high as 270 kilometers an
hour and four-meter storm surges and left more than 8,000
sheltering in emergency centers in Samoa,  Australia ’s Foreign
Minister Bob Carr said in a Dec. 18  statement  announcing a A$1
million ($1 million) aid commitment.  In neighboring Fiji, at least 13,900 people sought shelter
in evacuation centers, according to a  statement  from Australia’s
foreign aid agency on Dec. 20.  Samoa, an archipelago of two large islands and several
islets about halfway between  Hawaii  and  New Zealand , is home to
about 194,000 people, according to the Central Intelligence
Agency’s  World Factbook .  It lies just to the west of the U.S. territory of  American
Samoa , which was largely spared by the cyclone according to a
 National Weather Service bulletin .  To contact the reporter on this story:
