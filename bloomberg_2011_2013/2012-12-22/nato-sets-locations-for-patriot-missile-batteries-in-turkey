NATO allies picked the sites for
stationing Patriot missiles to defend  Turkey  from the spillover
of the civil war in  Syria .  The U.S.,  Netherlands  and Germany will each deploy two
Patriot batteries in the next few weeks, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization said in a statement in Brussels today.  The mission’s purpose is “to deter any threats to Turkey,
to defend Turkey’s population and territory and to de-escalate
the crisis on NATO’s southeastern border,” according to the
statement.  NATO agreed on Dec. 4 to deploy the defensive missiles
along the 900-kilometer (560-mile) frontier after forces loyal
to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad attacked rebel targets near
the border.  U.S. missiles will be based at Gaziantep, Dutch missiles at
Adana and German missiles at Kahramanmaras, NATO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
