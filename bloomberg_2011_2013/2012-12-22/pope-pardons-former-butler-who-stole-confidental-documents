Pope Benedict XVI  pardoned Paolo
Gabriele, his former butler, for stealing confidential papal
documents, allowing him to be released from prison.  The Pope visited Gabriele in jail today “in order to
confirm his forgiveness and communicate in person his decision
to grant Mr. Gabriele’s request for pardon,” the Vatican said
in a statement posted on its website. “This constitutes a
paternal gesture towards a person with whom the Pope shared a
relationship of daily familiarity for many years.”  Gabriele isn’t allowed to resume his previous duties or to
continue living in  Vatican City , according to the statement.
“The  Holy See , trusting in his sincere repentance, wishes to
offer him the possibility of returning to a serene family
life.”  Gabriele was convicted of theft by a Vatican tribunal Oct.
6 and was serving an 18-month sentence in a Vatican jail.
Gabriele had admitted passing confidential documents to an
Italian journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, who wrote the book “His
Holiness: Pope Benedict XVI’s Secret Papers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
