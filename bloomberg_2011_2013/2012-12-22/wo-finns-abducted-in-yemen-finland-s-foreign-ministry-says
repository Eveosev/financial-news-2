Two Finnish nationals and an
Austrian man were abducted by gunmen in the Yemeni capital of
Sanaa yesterday, Finland’s foreign ministry said.  An unidentified group of men took the Finnish couple and
the Austrian man in the city center, the ministry said today in
an e-mailed statement. Finland’s government is sending its
representative to Yemen today and Finnish officials are working
with  Austria  to resolve the situation, the ministry said.  Yemen suffers from terrorism and civil unrest as it makes
the transition to democracy under Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi, who was
elected president in February. The so-called Arab Spring, which
began almost two years ago in  Tunisia , led to the resignation of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Finland’s foreign ministry  said this month  it is advising
against traveling to Yemen, citing terrorism and kidnapping
attempts. The abducted Finnish man was studying in Yemen, and
his kidnapped partner, a woman, was visiting him, the foreign
ministry said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
