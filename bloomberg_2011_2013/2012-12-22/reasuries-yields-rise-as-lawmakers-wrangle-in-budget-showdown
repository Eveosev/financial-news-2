Treasury 10-year note yields
increased for a third consecutive week as lawmakers in
 Washington  worked to resolve a stalemate over the  budget
deficit , damping demand for  U.S. government debt .  The benchmark  yields  fell yesterday, paring the increase,
after House Speaker  John Boehner  scrapped a plan to allow higher
tax rates on income above $1 million. Without an agreement by
year-end, $600 billion of tax boosts and spending cuts will
start taking effect and may send the U.S. into recession, even
as reports have signaled the economy is improving. The U.S.
gained 140,000 jobs in December, a report Jan. 4 may show.  “Any surprising development on the fiscal cliff will cause
a reaction,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of  interest rates  at
Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York  one of 21 primary dealers that
trade with the  Federal Reserve . “We’re at that point where we
don’t expect rates to ratchet much higher. The impetus may be
some deal that’s positive. The fiscal cliff is hanging over the
market right now.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.76 percent this week in New York. The
yield fell three basis points yesterday, trimming the increase.
The price of the 1.625 percent note due in November 2022
decreased 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 3/4,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Thirty-year yields ended the week seven basis points higher
at 2.93 percent after a five-basis-point drop yesterday. They
reached 3.03 percent, the highest since Sept. 17, on Dec. 18.  Treasury Returns  Treasuries have returned 1.8 percent this year, set for the
worst annual performance since a 3.7 percent decline in 2009,
according to indexes compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
U.S. government securities have lost investors 0.4 percent this
quarter and 0.8 percent in December.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ended Dec. 18, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative  long positions , or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 67,142 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the least since August. Net-long positions fell
by 69,837 contracts, or 51 percent, from a week earlier, the
Washington-based commission said in its Commitments of Traders
report. It was the biggest weekly drop since March.  Two-Years  Large speculators increased their net-long bets on  two-year
note  futures in the same week, CFTC data showed. Long positions
outnumbered short positions by 168,622 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most since August. Net-long positions rose
by 108,231 contracts, or 179 percent, from a week earlier, the
commission said.  A vote on Boehner’s plan to allow higher tax rates was
canceled Dec. 20 because of resistance from within his own
Republican party, the House speaker said in a statement. Until
Dec. 17, President  Barack Obama  and Boehner had been edging
closer to a deal that would have included $1 trillion each in
tax increases and spending cuts to lower the budget deficit.  “The fiscal cliff is up to politics,” Steven Ricchiuto,
chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said
in a telephone interview on Dec. 20. “There’s a 60 percent
probability that they will come up with something with very few
details. They will kick the can down the road.”  The  Congressional Budget Office  has said the automatic
spending reductions and tax increases set to begin next month
unless lawmakers reach an accord would probably lead to a
recession in the first half of 2013.  Treasury Auctions  The Treasury sold $14 billion in five-year inflation-linked
notes at a record-low  negative yield  Dec. 20 as the stalemate
spurred demand for refuge. The Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities yielded negative 1.496 percent.  “It’s not the return, it’s the purpose,”  William Larkin , a fixed-income  money manager  who helps oversee $500
million at Cabot Money Management Inc. in Salem,  Massachusetts ,
said that day in an interview.  TIPS holders receive an adjustment to the principal value
of their securities equal to the change in the  consumer price
index , in addition to a fixed rate of interest that’s smaller
than what’s paid to a holder of conventional debt. The fixed
payment on five-year TIPS was pushed below zero as the rise in
the CPI was greater than the yield on regular U.S. notes, which
fell with other Treasury yields as investors sought safety.  The government sold $113 billion in coupon-bearing debt
this week: TIPS; $35 billion in two-year securities Dec. 17 at a
yield of 0.245 percent; an equal amount in five-year debt the
next day at a yield of 0.769 percent; and $29 billion in seven-
year notes Dec. 19 at 1.233 percent.  Record Demand  The week’s offerings closed the books on $2.153 trillion of
government debt sales in 2012 that set a record for
demand. The Treasury attracted $3.15 in bids for each dollar of
the notes and bonds it sold, surpassing last year’s bid-to-cover
ratio of 3.04 and the 2010 mark of 2.99.  Treasuries also fell this week as reports suggested the
 U.S. economy  is gathering momentum.  Third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product expanded 3.1
percent, more than the highest projection in a Bloomberg survey
and compared with the previous estimate of a 2.7 percent gain,
the Commerce Department reported Dec. 20. The median forecast of
economists called for 2.8 percent.  Consumer spending  increased 0.4 percent last month after a
0.1 percent drop in October, and durable-goods orders rose 0.7
percent, other Commerce Department reports showed.  U.S. employers will add almost as many jobs to payrolls in
December, according to economists in a Bloomberg survey before
the Labor Department reports the data next month, as the 146,000
new hires in November.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
recommends that, to observe the Christmas holiday, trading  stop 
at 2 p.m. New York time on Dec. 24 and remain closed Dec. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
