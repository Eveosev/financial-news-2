Indonesia ’s rupiah gained the most in
a week on optimism growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy
will attract global funds. Benchmark bonds declined.  The currency has advanced 5.1 percent this year as overseas
investors bought $2.5 billion more local shares than they sold,
exchange data show. Indonesia’s gross domestic product rose 6.49
percent in the three months through June from a year earlier,
compared with a revised increase of 6.47 percent in the previous
quarter, the Central Bureau of Statistics said Aug. 5. The
Dollar Index in New York dropped for a second day after  Standard
& Poor’s  lowered the world’s biggest economy’s  credit rating  by
one level to AA+ on Aug. 5.  “From the local side, we still have good economic
fundamentals,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of treasury at PT
Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “People think that if the U.S.
is getting worse, then money will come into  Asia . That’s why
Asian currencies including the rupiah are getting stronger.”  The rupiah gained 0.4 percent, the most since Aug. 1, to
8,543 per dollar as of 4:05 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank Indonesia will keep its benchmark interest rate
unchanged at 6.75 percent when it meets tomorrow, according to
all 20 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year government bonds fell, snapping two-days of gains.
The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 climbed two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.87 percent
according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer Market
Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
