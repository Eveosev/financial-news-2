Asia ’s gasoil traded at a discount to
the spot benchmark grade after Glencore International AG sold
the fuel for a third day in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-
trading center. Naphtha’s crack spread rebounded.  Middle Distillates  Glencore sold 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil,
or diesel, to BP Plc at 45 cents a barrel below benchmark
quotes, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the Platts window. That’s the same
discount as the previous reported transaction on Aug. 5.
Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, was the
biggest gasoil buyer in Singapore last month, purchasing at
least 4 million barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 9
cents to $19.30 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, widened 6 percent last week, the
most in five weeks.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil climbed 5 cents to $1.60 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade fell 45 cents, or 23 percent,
last week, indicating it was less profitable to produce  aviation
fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Japan ’s open-specification naphtha forward contracts for
second-half September delivery were bid at $908 a metric ton
against offers at $910, according to Ginga Petroleum Singapore
Pte, a broker. Prices last week closed at $905.38, the lowest
since June 29, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
rebounded $24.71 to $106.10 a ton at 5:50 p.m. Singapore time,
Bloomberg data showed. This crack spread last week dropped 32
percent, the most in five weeks.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 34 cents to
$4.48 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the smallest gap since June 27, signaling reduced losses
for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-centistoke
was unchanged after dropping to $8.75 a ton, PVM said. This
viscosity spread narrowed for a third week last week, meaning
bunker, or marine fuel, fell less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
