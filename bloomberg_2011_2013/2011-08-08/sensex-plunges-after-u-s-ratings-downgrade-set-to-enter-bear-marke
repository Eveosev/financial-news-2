Indian equities tumbled to the lowest
in 14 months after the loss of America’s top credit rating
fueled concern global economic growth will falter.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
sank to its lowest price since March 2009.  Hindalco Industries
Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker that controls U.S.-based Novelis Inc.,
fell the most since January. Infosys Ltd., the second-largest
software exporter, paced a decline among its peers.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
1.8 percent to 16,990.18, its lowest level since June 10, 2010.
The measure slumped 3.2 percent intraday, capping a 20 percent
drop from a November peak. A loss of 20 percent or more signals
a so-called  bear market  to some investors. The gauge trades at
13.8 times estimates earnings, the lowest since May 2009, and
down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last year’s high.  “Risk-aversion among global investors will reduce flows to
 India  in the near term, but India’s relative attractiveness
improves,” said Aneesh Srivastava, who oversees $465 million as
chief investment officer at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. in
Mumbai. “We’re using the drop to add to our holdings.”
Srivastava said he’s “positive” on banks, engineering and
construction companies.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index dropped 1.8 percent to 5,118.50.
The BSE-200 Index lost 1.7 percent to 2,118.23.  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. long-term rating one level
to AA+ after the markets closed on Aug. 5. It kept the outlook
at “negative.” Policy makers held emergency conference calls
over the weekend to try to stave off a collapse in investor
confidence that has already wiped out about $5.4 trillion in
global equity values since July 26.  ‘Incredibly Oversold’  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index retreated 2.6 percent, set
for the biggest five-day tumble since November 2008.  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index each sank 3.8
percent,  Indonesia ’s Jakarta Composite Index lost 1.8 percent
and  South Korea ’s Kospi tumbled 3.8 percent.  Equity markets are “incredibly oversold,” Marc Faber,
publisher of the Gloom, Boom & Doom report, said today in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. Stocks are “quite likely
to bottom out today or tomorrow and begin to rally,” he said.  India’s Sensex has retreated 17 percent this year, the
second-worst performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among major
indexes in the 10 biggest markets, on concern higher borrowing
costs will erode earnings. The central bank, which has lifted
rates 11 times since the start of 2010, today pledged to give
“adequate rupee and forex liquidity” to curb volatility in
interest and exchange rates.  The  Reserve Bank  of India in July maintained its growth
forecast of 8 percent for the year ending March. The economy
expanded 8.5 percent the previous year.  ‘Hawkish Stance’  India’s policy-tightening cycle is at the “fag end” and
recent global events and slowdown in the economy may force the
central bank to soften the “hawkish stance,” Kotak
Institutional Equities said in a report today.  “We expect inflation and  interest rates  to peak out over
the next two-three months and the RBI to reverse the current
tightening phase after another six to seven months once it is
comfortable with the inflation trajectory,” analysts led by
Sanjeev Prasad wrote in the report.  Reliance shed 1.4 percent to 780.65 rupees and its August
rupees settled at 784 rupees. Hindalco slumped 6.9 percent to
151.65 rupees.  Infosys fell 4.7 percent to 2,470.5 rupees. Larger rival
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  retreated 5 percent to 1,005.35
rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) , the third-biggest, tumbled 2.6 percent to
357.85 rupees. India’s software exporters secure at least 80
percent of their sales from abroad, leaving them vulnerable to a
slowdown in global economic growth.  Meeting Forecasts  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest producer of sport
utility vehicles and tractors, climbed 2.3 percent to 668.25
rupees after first-quarter profit rose 8 percent as it sold more
pick-up trucks and SUVs. Net income, excluding units, gained to
6.05 billion rupees ($135 million) in the quarter ended June,
compared with the 6.12 billion-rupee median of 32 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd., the biggest engineering company, fell
0.5 percent to 1,631.25 rupees, its fifth day of losses, after
reporting profit that matched analysts’ forecasts. Net income
climbed to 7.46 billion rupees from 6.66 billion rupees a year
earlier. That was in line with the 7.44 billion rupees median
estimate of 22 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas funds sold a net 1.47 billion rupees ($33 million)
of Indian equities on Aug. 4, paring their investment in stocks
this year to 92.1 billion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
