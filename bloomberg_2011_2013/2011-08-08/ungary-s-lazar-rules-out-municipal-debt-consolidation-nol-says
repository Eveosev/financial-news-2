Hungarian ruling party politician
Janos Lazar excluded the possibility of an “unconditional”
consolidation of local government debt, according to an
interview published on  Nol.hu  over the weekend.  Indebted municipalities should seek individual solutions
and agreements with financing banks, Nol cited Lazar, who heads
the ruling Fidesz party’s parliamentary group, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
