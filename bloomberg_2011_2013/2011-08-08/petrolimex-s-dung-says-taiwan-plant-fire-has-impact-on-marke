Vuong Thai Dung, deputy chief
executive officer of  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp. , the
country’s largest fuel importer, comments on the impact of
 Taiwan ’s  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  suspending export
obligations from its Mailiao processing plant, following a July
30 fire.  The company, known as Petrolimex, was seeking Aug. 5 to buy
45,000 metric tons of fuel oil and gasoline for August,
according to a document e-mailed to potential suppliers.The
gasoline requirement is specifically to cover imports that would
have come from Formosa, according to a person familiar with the
company’s operations.’’  On Southeast Asia oil-products market:  “In this neighborhood, there aren’t too many refineries,
so when for some reason, any refinery stops producing or
supplying products, that would have some impact on the market as
a whole.  ‘‘It has a general impact on the market. There is less
supply in the market so it will have to have an impact on
prices.’’  On the implications for Petrolimex:  ‘‘We don’t have any problem in terms of supply. With regard
to suppliers, we always have alternative plans. Without careful
preparation, any changes that have an overall impact on the
market can pose a threat’’ for procurement, he said.  ‘‘In the past, we have had some transactions with them, if
not directly, then through someone else.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
