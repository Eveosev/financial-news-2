The Libyan Embassy in London will
reopen today under the control of the rebel National
Transitional Council, which is fighting to oust  Muammar Qaddafi 
from power.  U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said on June 27 he was
expelling the remaining staff from the embassy and inviting the
NTC to appoint an envoy. The new charge d’affaires, Mahmud
Nacua, will lead a ceremony to reopen the mission at 3 p.m.  “The reopening of the embassy symbolizes how far we have
come,” Nacua said in an e-mailed statement. “The embassy
represents the legitimate government of Libya and in line with
this will serve all the Libyan community irrespective of their
political allegiances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
