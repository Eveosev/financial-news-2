Turkish clothing retailers are ending
discounts because of new taxes on imported clothing, higher raw
material prices and a depreciating lira,  Haberturk  newspaper
reported.  Customers are likely to see higher prices and a more
limited selection while retailers will have lower profit
margins, the Istanbul-based newspaper said, citing Turkish
clothing-industry executives. Import taxes of as much as 30
percent took effect on July 21, Haberturk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
