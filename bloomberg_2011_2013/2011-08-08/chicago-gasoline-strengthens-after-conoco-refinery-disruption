Gasoline in  Chicago  strengthened
after ConocoPhillips’ Wood River refinery in Illinois reported
it experienced a decline in its power supply over the weekend.  “We did have a power dip at about 2:30 a.m. and
everything’s been restarted and our units are operating
normally,” Janet Grothe, a Houston-based spokeswoman for
ConocoPhillips, said in a telephone interview. She declined to
comment on which units were affected from the Aug. 6 incident.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 1.5 cents to 4.75 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:35 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
9.63 cents to $2.6464 a gallon.  Conoco’s 380,900-barrel-a-day plant has had at least four
electrical disruptions in six weeks, based on regulatory
filings.  The same fuel in the Gulf Coast also narrowed its discount
0.1 cent to 9.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  said an off-gas compressor fire
resulted in gases being flared at its Big Spring refinery in
Texas, according to a  filing  with state regulators.  Emergency crews responded, controlled the event and stopped
the flaring, the Dallas-based company said in a notice to the
 Texas Commission on Environmental Quality . The Aug. 5 incident
lasted about 42 minutes, the filing showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
