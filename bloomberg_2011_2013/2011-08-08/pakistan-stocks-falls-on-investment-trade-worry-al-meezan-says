Mohammad Shoaib, who oversees the
equivalent of $346 million in Pakistani stocks and bonds at Al-
Meezan Investment Management Ltd. in Karachi, comments on the
outlook for Pakistani equities after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the
U.S. credit rating, fueling concern a global economic recovery
is faltering. Shoaib spoke in a phone interview.  The Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index fell 2.6 percent to
11,083.22 at 9:29 a.m. local time.  On the share-market impact:  “The impact on  Pakistan ’s market is driven more by worries
about a global slowdown and how that will affect our exports,
and less by the pullout of foreign investors from the market.
There are also now worries about receiving support funds from
the  United States  and the  International Monetary Fund .”  On support levels:  “The market started falling on Friday and is falling
further in line with regional markets. The Karachi Stock
Exchange 100 Index may find support at the 11,000 level, and
that can also be taken as an opportunity for fresh buying.”  On the sectors that will be affected:  “Oil and gas would definitely be affected due to the price
fall and sectors that are less dependent on global trade will be
safer to stay in, such as fertilizer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
