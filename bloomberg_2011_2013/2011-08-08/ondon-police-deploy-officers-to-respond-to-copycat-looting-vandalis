London police continued to deploy
officers in areas in the north, east and south of the city in
response to “copycat criminal activity,” the  Metropolitan
Police Service  said in an e-mailed statement.  Looting has occurred in a number of areas “by small and
mobile groups,” the statement said, adding that “groups of
youth continue to attack police officers, and a number of police
vehicles have been damaged.”  Three officers were taken to hospital after being hit by a
“fast-moving vehicle,” the statement said. Stores were
vandalized and looted in Walthamstow Central, Waltham Forest and
Brixton. Other areas where disturbances and looting occurred
included Enfield Town Centre, Oxford Circus, Islington and
Ponders End, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
