Ananth Narayan G., the Mumbai-based
head of South Asian currency and bond trading at Standard
Chartered Plc, comments on the outlook for Indian 10-year notes,
the rupee, and the repurchase rate.  On bonds:  “Broadly, the move should be towards 8.25 percent for the
10-year note till the end of the month. Overall,  interest rates 
should head southward because lower  oil prices  give a lot of
room to maneuver for credit policy and inflation. Having said
that, the fact that we’ll have relentless supply will mean the
fall cannot be sharp.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent 10-year bond fell seven basis
points to 8.25 percent as of 1:47 p.m. in Mumbai.  On the rupee:  “In the medium term, we still think given the interest-
rate differential and the fact that risk-off eventually means
lower commodity and oil prices as well, it would be positive for
the rupee.”  The U.K. bank is retaining its forecasts for the rupee to
strengthen to 44 per dollar by the end of September, he said.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.6 percent to
45.48 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
contracts reflect bets the rupee will drop 1.1 percent from the
spot rate of 44.96.  On the repurchase rate:  “A lot depends on where oil prices eventually settle and
right now that is unclear. If things stay as they are right now,
then I personally don’t think there’s a rate hike” from the
 Reserve Bank  of India when it reviews policy in September.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
