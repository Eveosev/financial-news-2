Russia  is “clearly underrated” by
credit rating companies because its debt relative to the
economy’s size is below the level in most developed and emerging
nations, the Finance Ministry said.  Russia, rated BBB at  Standard & Poor’s , the second-lowest
investment grade, has a debt-to-GDP of 9.3 percent, the ministry
said today in a  report  on its website. That compares with 42.7
percent for similarly rated  Mexico , it said.  The ratio will rise to 17 percent by the end of 2014 as
Russia seeks to borrow more than 2 trillion rubles ($70 billion)
a year to finance budget shortfalls, according to the report.
Boosting the rating to “A” level is a government priority, the
ministry said. The country’s low rating is an “outrage,” Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  said July 13.  “Low levels of state debt favorably set Russia apart from
the vast majority of developed and developing countries,” the
ministry said in the report, which outlines its debt strategy
through 2014. Russia’s rating at all three major agencies
“shows that our country is clearly underrated.”  The nation’s sovereign credit rating was last raised by
Moody’s Investors Service in 2008 to Baa1, the third-lowest
investment grade, one step above  Brazil  and four below  China .  Ruble Debt  Ruble-denominated government debt lost 2.6 percent in
dollar terms last week, JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes show. The
benchmark 2018 ruble Eurobond yielded 7.054 percent today, the
highest since April 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are fleeing riskier assets as policy makers in
the U.S. and  Europe  grapple with sovereign debt crises amid
signs of slowing economic growth. The  European Central Bank 
returned to bond markets as a slump in Italian and Spanish bonds
intensified threats to the euro region.  Russia, which defaulted on $40 billion of local debt in
1998, sold dollar-denominated Eurobonds for the first time in a
decade last year, issuing a total of $5.5 billion. The
government in February sold its debut offering of local-currency
debt to international investors.  ‘Limited Volumes’  The government will place Eurobonds in “limited volumes”
to maintain its presence as a borrower on global financial
markets, the ministry said in the report.  Russia will seek to cover on average 90 percent of its
budget deficits through 2014 through domestic borrowing, the
ministry said.  Domestic debt issuance is set to reach 2.18 trillion rubles
next year before rising to 2.28 trillion rubles in 2013 and 2.47
trillion rubles in 2014. Foreign debt sales are expected to be
203.8 billion rubles next year, before easing to 201.8 billion
in 2013 and 200.5 billion in 2014.  “Developing the national  debt market  is an absolute
priority” in the medium term, including improvements to market
infrastructure, boosting liquidity and expanding the investor
base, the ministry wrote.  Russia’s debt plan faces risks, including the rising debt-
to-GDP ratio, which may reach 11.2 percent at the end of this
year, 14.1 percent next year and 16.1 percent in 2013, the
report said. The country’s revenue is also highly dependent on
 oil prices  remaining near current high levels, the report said.  A $10 drop in oil prices would cut Russian budget revenue
by about 500 billion rubles, boosting the deficit by 1 percent.  Oil Drops  Oil fell to the lowest price in more than eight months
today, dropping as much as 5 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Urals crude, Russia’s main export blend, was trading
at $105.97 a barrel, down 1.9 percent.  The government predicts Urals will average $93 in 2012, $95
in 2013 and $97 in 2014. Crude prices would have to average $125
over the period for the budget to balance, the  Finance Ministry 
has said.  State debt may exceed 21 percent of GDP by 2013 or 2014 if
oil prices drop to $60 a barrel, the Finance Ministry said,
citing its stress tests. The deficit would balloon to more than
5 percent of GDP, compared with a planned 2.7 percent in 2012-
2013 and 2.3 percent the following year.  Under that scenario, cash from state asset sales, the
National Welfare Fund and higher taxes could be used to fund the
government’s revenue shortfall, according to the document. This
would lead to a “buildup in significant budget risks, including
at the very least a significant worsening of Russia’s borrowing
terms.”  The market for so-called OFZ bonds is highly volatile
because of dependence on external factors such as conditions on
global capital and commodities markets, the ministry said.  Foreign investors hold about 64 billion rubles in OFZs, or
3 percent of the outstanding volume, the ministry said. OAO
Sberbank holds 29 percent, while other Russian lenders own 30
percent, and VEB, the state development bank controls 16
percent. The central bank controls another 10 percent.  Russia will focus on mid- to long-term issues while using
debt with maturities of up to one year as an “exceptional
measure,” according to the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
