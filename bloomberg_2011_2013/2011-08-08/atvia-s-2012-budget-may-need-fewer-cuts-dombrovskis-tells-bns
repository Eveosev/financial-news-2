Latvia may need fewer budget cuts
than previously estimated to meet its 2012 deficit target as the
economy recovers from a two-year recession, Prime Minister
Valdis Dombrovskis said, the  Baltic News Service  reported.  “We see a positive trend in the macro economy and the
second-quarter data will be better than in the first quarter,”
the Riga-based newswire cited Dombrovskis as saying today. Cuts
may be lower than a previous estimate of as much as 110 million
lati ($220 million), said Dombrovskis, who also cited higher-
than-expected tax receipts, BNS reported.  Latvia plans to report an initial estimate of second-
quarter gross domestic product tomorrow. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of nine economists is for growth of 4.5
percent, which would be the quickest since the end of 2007.  The Baltic country expects a budget deficit of 2.5 percent
of GDP in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
