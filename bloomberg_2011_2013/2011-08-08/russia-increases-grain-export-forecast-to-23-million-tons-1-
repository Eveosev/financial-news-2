Russia  raised its grain-export
forecast the third time in as many weeks to as much as 23
million metric tons as the domestic crop recovers from last
year’s drought.  The country plans to export 20 million to 23 million tons
of grain this year, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik 
told reporters today in Krasnodar in southern Russia. Russia has
exported 2.6 million tons of grain so far this year, almost 25
percent more than a year earlier, she said.  Russia resumed grain exports in July after banning overseas
sales in August because of the worst drought in at least 50
years. The ministry maintained its grain-crop forecast of 85
million to 90 million tons this year, Skrynnik said. Wheat
yields are 35 percent higher than in 2010, according to the
ministry.  Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  raised its grain export
forecast to 20 million tons on July 25, and to 18 million tons
on July 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
