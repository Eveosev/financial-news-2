Oil fell to the lowest level in more
than eight months as investors fled commodities for assets such
as Treasury bills and gold after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded
the U.S. credit rating for the first time.  Futures dropped 6.4 percent on the first trading day after
the ratings service cut the U.S. one level to AA+ late on Aug. 5
and kept the outlook at “negative.” Two-year Treasury yields
fell to a record low and gold touched a record high on the Comex
in New York. The MSCI All-Country World Index of stocks slid as
much as 5.1 percent.  “There’s flight away from any kind of risky assets at the
moment,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity
Futures Inc. in New York. “It’s hard to say where the bottom
is.”  Oil for September delivery fell $5.57 to $81.31 on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since Nov. 23.
It was the biggest one-day decline since futures tumbled 8.6
percent on May 5. Crude has fallen 15 percent in August and 11
percent in 2011.  New York futures have tumbled 29 percent since reaching a
two-year high of $114.83 in intraday trading on May 2. Implied
volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was at 68.7 percent at 3 p.m. in New York, up
from 40.9 percent Aug. 5.  Brent crude for September settlement on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange decreased $5.63, or 5.2 percent, to
settle at $103.74 a barrel. The European benchmark contract was
at a $22.43 premium to U.S. futures, near the record $22.67
spread based on settlement prices Aug. 2.  U.S. Downgrade  S&P said it downgraded the U.S. credit rating because the
agreement by President  Barack Obama  and congressional
Republicans didn’t do enough to stabilize the government’s
“medium-term debt dynamics.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 4.4 percent to
1,147.07 and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 3.5 percent
to 11,047.42 at 3:21 p.m. in New York.  “This is a blow to the market psyche and confidence going
forward,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a
New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “The pressure
is going to remain on prices until we see some sign that things
are improving.”  Fibonacci Analysis  Oil settled below technical support at both $82.87, its low
from last week, and $83.85, the 61.8 percent retracement of the
rally from the 2010 lows in a Fibonacci study.  Tom Fitzpatrick ,
chief technical analyst at Citi FX, a part of Citigroup Capital
Markets in New York, said in a note to clients today that
breaching those levels would send crude to test $76.17, a price
that corresponds with the 76.4 percent retracement level on the
Fibonacci chart.  The Group of Seven nations said they will act to stabilize
financial markets following the U.S. rating cut as a slump in
Italian and Spanish debt intensified threats to the global
economy. The  European Central Bank  said late yesterday that it
will “actively implement” its bond-purchase program, signaling
it’s ready to start buying Italian and Spanish securities to
counter the sovereign-debt crisis.  “The U.S. downgrade is pushing equities and oil lower, and
we might see a further slump until the government announces
actions to boost liquidity, such as a new round of quantitative
easing,” said  Eugen Weinberg , an analyst at Commerzbank AG.
“The European Central Bank buying Italian and Spanish bonds
will increase confidence in markets, helping them recover.”  $130 a Barrel  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. maintained its 2012 forecast for
 Brent crude  to average $130 a barrel and recommended investors
hold a “long” trading position on December 2012 contracts, New
York-based analyst  David Greely  said in an e-mail today.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities dropped as much as 4 percent to the lowest level
since Jan. 26 as energy and agricultural markets tumbled.  Gold futures for December delivery touched a record
$1,723.40. They settled up $61.40, or 3.7 percent, at $1,713.20
on the Comex.  Yields on 10-year notes fell 22 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, to 2.34 percent at 2:33 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Hedge funds  cut bullish bets on crude oil by the most in
more than six months on growing concern that the faltering
economic recovery will sap energy demand.  The funds and other large speculators cut wagers that
prices will rise by 16 percent in the week ended Aug. 2, the
most since Jan. 25, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders report. Crude dropped
5.8 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  in the period
covered by the data.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 805,219
contracts as of 3:23 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 964,423
contracts Aug. 5, 40 percent above the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
