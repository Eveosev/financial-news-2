Climate Energy Ltd., which advises
British authorities and landlords on  carbon emissions  and energy
savings, acquired  Ecotech , a provider of energy-efficient homes,
to expand the company’s holdings.  The Witham, U.K., company approached Ecotech, based in
Newbury, in April and bought it on July 29. Catherine Owen, a
spokeswoman for Climate Energy, would not disclose terms of the
purchase.  Under the government’s Green Deal program, private
companies will be able to offer consumers  energy-efficiency 
improvements at no immediate cost, recouping payments later
through installment charges on their energy bills. The plan was
introduced as part of the government’s energy bill last December
and is expected to be completed late next year.  Andrew Holmes, managing director of Climate Energy,
welcomed Ecotech’s experience in sustainable housing. “We are
closer to realizing our ambitions to further our influence over
the sustainable  construction industry ,” he said in a statement.  Climate Energy, founded in 2005, advises more than 100
local authorities and registered landlords about energy
efficiency, according to its website. The company was bought by
Climate Change Capital Ltd., a London-based environmental
investment manager, in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
