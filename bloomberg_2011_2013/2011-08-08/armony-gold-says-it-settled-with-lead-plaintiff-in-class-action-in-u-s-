Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s
third-biggest producer of the metal, said it settled with the
lead plaintiff of a group that claimed the company overstated
earnings in 2007.  The settlement is a “reasonable amount with which we’re
comfortable,” Marian van der Walt, a spokeswoman for
Johannesburg-based Harmony, said today by mobile phone,
declining to disclose the details.  Harmony hasn’t admitted any liability in connection with
the proposed settlement of the class action, filed in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of  New York  in May
2008, it said in a statement. The court will hold a hearing on
Nov. 10 to rule on whether the agreement will be approved.  “A mediated settlement process was followed to avoid
protracted and expensive litigation,” Harmony’s Chief Executive
Officer Graham Briggs said in today’s statement.  The company dropped 1.1 percent to 92.70 rand by the 5 p.m.
close of Johannesburg trading. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share
Index declined 3 percent.  Former Chief Executive Officer Bernard Swanepoel and
Financial Director Nomfundo Qangule resigned in 2008 after the
company said it overlooked about 250 million rand ($35 million)
of costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
