The Czech Republic’s stock index fell
for a fifth day, headed for its biggest decline in more than 14
months, as investors ditched riskier assets worldwide after
 Standard & Poor’s  cut the AAA rating on America’s debt.  The PX gauge of 14 companies fell 3.4 percent to 1,055.8 by
1:10 p.m. in  Prague . A close at that level would mark the
biggest one-day drop since June 4, 2010. The index has lost 10.5
percent in the past five days.  European stocks, U.S. index futures and oil fell while gold
rose to a record as the U.S. rating cut fueled concern that the
global economy will slow, overshadowing the  European Central
Bank ’s purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds.  “The U.S. rating cut is the main theme of this morning,”
Petr Bartek, an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS in Prague, wrote
in a report to clients today. “We expect a near-term outflow of
investors from riskier assets, mainly stocks.”  Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG) , with a 19 percent weighting
in the index, slid 3.3 percent to 672.9 koruna, heading for its
lowest close since June 2010. Mining company New World Resources
Plc slumped 11 percent to 165 koruna, heading for the lowest
since December 2009.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV) 
fell to a two-year low, falling 15 percent to 216 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
