Serbian shares fell the most in
almost three years, leading declines among former Yugoslavian
stock indexes on concern about the effects of the U.S. credit
downgrade and the debt crisis in  Europe .  Serbia’s Belex15 gauge dropped 5.9 percent, the most since
October 2008, to close at 639.33 points in Belgrade. Lender
Agrobanka AD led the declines with a 10.5 percent drop.
Croatia’s Crobex slid 4.6 percent, the most in more than two
years while Slovenia’s SBITOP fell 2.6 percent, sinking to the
lowest level in almost eight years.  “The recent downturn on world equity markets and the
eurozone debt crisis also affect  stock exchanges  in the former
Yugoslavia,” Jernej Kozlevcar, a fund manager at Triglav Asset
Management Co in Ljubljana, said in a phone interview today.
“Main stock indexes in Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade were
severely hit with low market depth and liquidity also being one
of the reasons for allowing big daily swings.”  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S. credit score for the
first time. The  European Central Bank  started buying Italian and
Spanish assets as it seeks to contain the spreading of the
European debt crisis.  In Romania, the BET stock index led declines among all
Balkan nations, closing down 8.4 percent, the biggest one-day
decline since May last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
