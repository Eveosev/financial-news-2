The cost of insuring against default
on corporate debt fell, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 9.5 basis points to 541
at 7:31 a.m. in  London , according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 3.75 basis points to 133 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 17 basis points to 195 and
the subordinated index dropped 25.5 to 339.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
