JA Solar Holdings Co., a Chinese
manufacturer of solar cells and panels, fell to its lowest in
almost two years after it said gross margin may plunge.  JA fell 69 cents, or 17 percent, to $3.35 at 5:20 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  The company estimated that while product shipments in the
second quarter would be in line with previous guidance of about
400 megawatts, the company’s expected gross margin indicates
that it will lose money on the shipments, according to a
statement today. The company reported gross margin of 17.3
percent in the first quarter.  “Our gross margin was negatively impacted by a worse than
anticipated decline in average selling prices, and the impact of
high-cost inventory provisions for the quarter,” Chief
Executive Officer Peng Fang in the statement.  Germany , the U.S. and  China  are expected to be
“particularly strong” in the second half, he added.  JA’s board also authorized the repurchase of up to $100
million of its American Depositary Shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
