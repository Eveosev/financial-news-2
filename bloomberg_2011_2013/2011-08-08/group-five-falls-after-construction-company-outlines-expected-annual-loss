Group Five Ltd., a South African
construction company, fell 2.8 percent in Johannesburg trading
after outlining its full-year loss estimate.  Group Five declined 79 cents to 27.57 rand, bringing its
slump this year to 25 percent.  The company will report a per-share net loss within a range
of 2.18 rand to 2.43 rand for the year ended June 30,
Johannesburg-based Group Five said in statement today. Excluding
one-time items, earnings per share probably dropped by as much
as 45 percent to 3.37 rand. Group Five had said on July 5 that
it would probably report a full-year net loss of 2.52 rand to
2.80 rand.  “This is confirmation that the construction sector is
struggling,” Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio manager at
Johannesburg-based RMB Asset Management, said by phone. “Group
Five’s earnings could be at the bottom now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
