Evraz Highveld Steel & Vanadium Ltd.,
 South Africa ’s second-biggest steelmaker, said it’s not aware of
any reason for the gain today in its stock, which jumped the
most in two years in Johannesburg trading.  The shares advanced as much as 15 percent to 44.99 rand,
the largest intraday increase since July 14, 2009, and were at
43.99 rand at 4:23 p.m., valuing Evraz Highveld at about 4.4
billion rand ($630 million). In excess of 180,000 shares were
traded, more than triple the three-month average. The FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index was down 2.2 percent.  The company has no information to disclose that would
explain today’s trading, Cathie Lewis, a spokeswoman, said by
mobile phone. “We think the share has been undervalued, and
hopefully the market is starting to see this.”  Highveld has slumped 46 percent this year and dropped 11
percent to 39 rand on Aug. 5, the lowest close since November
2004. The steelmaker is 85 percent owned by Mastercroft Ltd., a
unit of  Evraz Group SA (EVR) , according to the South African company’s
2010 annual report.  The company operates an iron ore mine in Limpopo province
and produces structural and flat steel products and vanadium
slag. It is due to release interim results on Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
