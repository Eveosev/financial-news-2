European coal may average $123 to
$124 a metric ton in the fourth quarter, said Miswin Mahesh, an
analyst at  Barclays Capital  in London. Thermal coal to make
electricity fell $1.65, or 1.3 percent, to $125.25 a ton by 5:19
p.m. in London. Mahesh commented by e-mail today from London.  On European coal prices:  “We expect fourth quarter demand to be supported by
restocking demand in  Europe  and also from increased coal burn in
Germany to offset the loss from nuclear generation.”  “Our price forecasts hold true if on the supply side we do
not see any major disruption similar to what we had seen last
year where abnormal events played its part.”  “These prices will hold given the expected demand and
supply dynamics which currently point to a well supplied market
and a potentially more elevated demand during the winter
months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
