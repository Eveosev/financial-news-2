President Barack Obama today approved
$105 million in famine relief for the Horn of  Africa , where
millions of people are in urgent need of aid amid the worst
drought in 60 years, the White House said.  More than 12.4 million people in  Ethiopia ,  Kenya , and
Somalia require humanitarian assistance, according to the  United
Nations . The famine has been compounded by two decades of civil
war in Somalia. Thousands of Somalis are fleeing the famine and
seeking refuge in Kenya and Ethiopia, which are also affected by
the drought, according to the White House.  Aid announced today comes after previous donations of about
$565 million in humanitarian assistance, including food, health,
shelter, water and sanitation assistance, the White House said
in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
