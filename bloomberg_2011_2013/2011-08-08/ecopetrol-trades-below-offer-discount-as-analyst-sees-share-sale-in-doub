Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  fell to a three-week low
to trade below a discount price for investors paying cash to
take part in a $1.38 billion stock sale that is  Colombia ’s
largest in almost four years amid a rout in global equities.  The Colombian state-controlled oil producer slid 1.8
percent to 3,595 pesos in Bogota trading, the lowest close since
July 15. The company seeks to sell 676 million shares at 3,700
pesos per share, or 3,608 pesos a share for cash payment. The
sale is from July 27 until Aug. 17.  “The timing for Ecopetrol wasn’t the best,” said  David Aldana , an economic analyst at brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA in
Bogota. “A price under 3,608 brings a bit into doubt the
success of the placement.”  A slump in U.S. equities markets and a drop in oil prices
to a more than eight-month low may stymie efforts by Latin
American oil producers to raise expansion funds. Brazilian
state-controlled producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s Chief
Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said today that the
global equities and economic crisis may reduce demand for assets
it seeks to divest.  1-Trillion Pesos  As of Aug. 4, Bogota-based Ecopetrol received orders for
about 1 trillion pesos ($551.4 million) of shares, an official
who can’t be identified because of corporate policy said today
in an e-mail.  The company seeks to raise as much as 2.5 trillion pesos in
the Andean nation’s largest sale since Ecopetrol raised 5.72
trillion pesos in its initial public offering in 2007.  The sale will help fund an $80 billion investment plan this
decade to boost output to about 1.3 million barrels a day in
2020. Second-quarter output rose to 727,200 barrels a day from
an average 594,400 barrels a year earlier.  Ecopetrol plans to produce 1 million barrels per day in
2015, in part from acquisitions.  This year, the stock has declined 12 percent. Colombia’s
benchmark Colcap index has dropped 15 percent.  Oil for September delivery fell $5.57 to $81.31 a barrel at
2:03 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Nov. 23. Crude has fallen 15 percent in August
and 11 percent in 2011.  U.S. stocks sank the most since December 2008. The  S&P 500
Index  lost 6.7 percent to 1,119.46 at 4 p.m. in  New York , its
lowest level since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
