Bulgaria  will complete the tender for
the sale of 80 percent of  Bulgartabak Holding (57B) , the state tobacco
company, even though only one bidder remained after  British
American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  pulled out,  Dnevnik  reported.  Bulgaria’s asset-selling agency will evaluate a bid by BT
Invest GmbH, owned by Russia’s VTB bank, that’s to be submitted
by Aug. 29, the newspaper said, citing Emil Karanikolov, who
heads the agency. If the bid complies with all criteria,
Bulgartabak will be sold to BT Invest, if not, the transaction
will be canceled, according to Dnevnik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
