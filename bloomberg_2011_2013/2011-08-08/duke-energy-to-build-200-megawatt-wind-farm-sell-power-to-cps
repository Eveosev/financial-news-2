Duke Energy Corp. (DUK)  agreed to build a
200-megawatt windpower plant in southern  Texas  and sell the
output to CPS Energy,  San Antonio ’s municipal utility.  Duke plans to begin construction later this year and
complete it by the end of next year, the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company said in a statement today. The project,
located about 120 miles (190 kilometers) south of  Corpus
Christi , will be Duke’s fourth wind farm in Texas.  CPS agreed to buy the output and renewable energy credits
from the Los Vientos I wind farm over 25 years, according to the
statement. The utility also buys output from Duke’s 14-megawatt
solar plant in San Antonio, completed last November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
