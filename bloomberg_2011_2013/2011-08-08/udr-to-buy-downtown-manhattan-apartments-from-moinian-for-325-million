UDR Inc. (UDR) , the third-largest publicly
traded U.S. apartment owner, agreed to buy a downtown Manhattan
apartment tower owned by the Moinian Group for about $325
million, expanding its foothold in the  New York  market.  The 507-unit  Dwell95  will give UDR 1,916 apartments in the
borough, the Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based real estate
investment trust said today in a statement. The 22-story
building at 95 Wall St. was home to JPMorgan Chase & Co. before
it was acquired by Moinian in 2006 and converted to apartments
two years later, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.  “Dwell95 provides a unique opportunity to further our
presence in the Financial District, an area of Manhattan that we
believe will continue to benefit from the redevelopment of the
World Trade Center and surrounding areas,” Tom Toomey, UDR’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  The purchase, the REIT’s fourth in the borough, will be
funded in part with $275 million in cash UDR raised from its
sales of apartment communities, according to the statement. The
company will also issue about $50 million in operating
partnership units.  UDR made its first  Manhattan  purchase earlier this year,
when it paid $260.8 million for 10 Hanover Square in the
Financial District, about a block from Dwell95. Last month, the
company said it will pay a combined $581 million for two
Manhattan rental communities: the 706-unit Rivergate complex in
Murray Hill and a 210-unit community called 21 Chelsea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
