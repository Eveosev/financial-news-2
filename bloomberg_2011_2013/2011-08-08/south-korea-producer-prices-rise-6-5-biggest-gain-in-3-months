South Korea ’s producer prices rose at
the fastest pace in three months, complicating the central
bank’s interest rate decision this week as it grapples with the
escalating debt problems in the U.S. and  Europe .  Prices increased 6.5 percent in July from a year earlier,
after a 6.2 percent gain in June, the Bank of Korea said in a
statement in Seoul today. They rose 0.4 percent from June.  The central bank will probably hold its benchmark seven-day
repurchase rate at 3.25 percent on Aug. 11 after three increases
this year, according to nine of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Financial market volatility may overtake
inflation as the most immediate threat to the economy after the
Kospi stock index slid 3.8 percent yesterday, its biggest drop
since November 2009.  Consumer prices rose 4.7 percent last month from a year ago,
breaching the central bank’s 4 percent target ceiling for a
seventh straight month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
