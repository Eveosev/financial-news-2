South Africa ’s benchmark stock index
fell to the lowest level in almost 11 months as commodity prices
declined on concern a cut in the U.S. credit rating by  Standard
& Poor’s  may worsen the economic slowdown, eroding demand.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share index retreated for a fifth
day, losing 3 percent to 28,391.18, the lowest since Sept. 10,
at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. BHP Billiton Ltd., the
world’s largest mining company, fell for an 11th day, the
longest losing streak on record, slipping 4.9 percent. Anglo
American Plc dropped 5.1 percent, closing at its lowest level
since Aug. 31 as copper fell as much as 3.2 percent in  London .  Group of Seven nations said they’re ready to stabilize
financial markets after S&P lowered the U.S. rating by one level
to AA+. A collapse in investor confidence has wiped $5.4
trillion off global equity values since July 26, driving the
MSCI All-Country World Index down more than 17 percent from this
year’s high.  The JSE has dropped 14 percent from its Feb. 14 closing
high, losing almost 600 billion rand ($84 billion) in market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
