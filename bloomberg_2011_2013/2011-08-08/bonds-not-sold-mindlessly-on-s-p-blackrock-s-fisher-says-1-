Investors aren’t selling Treasuries
“mindlessly” after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the long-term U.S.
credit rating from AAA, according to  Peter Fisher , head of fixed
income at BlackRock Inc.  The decision by S&P is a “warning shot” to investors and
politicians, said New York-based Fisher, whose company is the
world’s biggest money manager, in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “InsideTrack” with Erik Schatzker.  Treasuries rallied, erasing an initial decline sustained in
response to the S&P downgrade following the close of markets on
Aug. 5. The yield on the two-year U.S. note dropped to a record
low 0.24 percent on demand for a refuge. Futures on the  S&P 500
Index  expiring in September slid 2.4 percent.  Bond volatility isn’t as bad as some may have seen, said
Fisher, 55. U.S. government debt securities remain the most
liquid and transparent investments, the former Treasury
Department undersecretary said in a phone interview.  S&P lowered the top AAA credit rating for the U.S. for the
first time following the close of markets on Aug. 5, criticizing
the nation’s political process and saying lawmakers failed to
cut spending enough to reduce record deficits.  The ratings company dropped the U.S. long-term ranking one
level to AA+ after warning on July 14 that it would reduce the
rating in the absence of a “credible” plan to lower deficits.  BLK US <Equity> CN  To contact the reporters on this story:
