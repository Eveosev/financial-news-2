Egypt ’s central bank will offer 8
billion Egyptian pounds ($1.3 billion) in seven-day  repurchase
agreements  at an auction tomorrow.  The contracts, or repos, allow holders of  government
securities  to sell them back to the central bank to access funds
for one week at 9.25 percent, according to Central Bank of Egypt
data on Bloomberg. The bank accepted all 1.19 billion pounds of
bids for repos on Aug. 2 from the 3 billion pounds it had
offered.  The nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bond maturing in April
2020 advanced. The yield dropped seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 5.59 percent at 4:50 p.m. in Cairo,
according to Bloomberg prices.  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to 5.9595 against the
dollar. The currency earlier dropped to 5.9611, matching the low
on July 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
