Opposition parties in  Mauritania ,
 Africa ’s second-biggest iron-ore producer, set conditions
including the ability to hold peaceful demonstrations that
need to be met before they start talks with President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.  The Rassemblement des Forces Democratiques and the Union
des Forces du Progres, the northwest African nation’s biggest
opposition parties, also called for a halt to the use of
security forces for “political purposes,” opening up of the
state media for civil-society and political groups and
agreement on an election framework, according to the e-mailed
statement.  The parties also want the talks to take place as outlined
in the 2009 Dakar Agreement, which called for dialogue
following a coup in August 2008 that ousted Sidi Ould Cheikh
Abdallahi from power.  Mauritania is scheduled to hold legislative and local
elections in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
