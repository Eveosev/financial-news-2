GB Auto, the biggest independent car
maker in the  Middle East , said its second-quarter profit fell 35
percent because of the economic collapse following the public
revolt that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  Net income declined to 50.5 million Egyptian pounds ($8.5
million) from 77.7 million pounds in the same quarter a year-
earlier, the Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Sales rose 6.8 percent to 1.86 billion pounds.  “We are very encouraged by the outcome of a second quarter
in which key lines of business posted commendable results given
the economic and political environment in which we continue to
operate,” GB Auto Chief Executive Officer Raouf Ghabbour said
in the statement.  Revenue from passenger cars rose 6 percent to 1.38 billion
pounds while sales from motorcycles and three wheelers increased
79 percent to 239.5 million pounds, GB Auto said.  Shares of GB Auto declined 2.4 percent to 30.54 Egyptian
pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, valuing the company at
3.94 billion pounds ($661 million).  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
