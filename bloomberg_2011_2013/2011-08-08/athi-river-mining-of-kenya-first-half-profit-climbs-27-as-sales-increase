Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML) ,  Kenya ’s
second-biggest cement maker by market value, said first-half
profit climbed 27 percent amid growing demand for its products.  Net income increased to 441.9 million shillings ($4.75
million) in the six months through June, from 347.9 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement published in the Standard newspaper today. Revenue
rose 30 percent to 3.7 billion shillings, it said.  “Demand for all the company’s products remains strong,”
it said. “The company has taken measures to counter the impact
of higher input costs, depreciation of local currency, the
highly competitive market environment and the effect of the
drought on the economy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
