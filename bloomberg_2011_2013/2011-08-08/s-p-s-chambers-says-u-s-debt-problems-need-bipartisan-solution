U.S. lawmakers need to come together
as they did for a 1980s overhaul of Social Security and
compromise on the medium-term consolidation of the country’s
fiscal position, said  John Chambers , chairman of  Standard &
Poor’s  sovereign debt committee.  “This is a problem that has to be addressed by the full
spectrum of political parties,” he said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television.  S&P on Aug. 5 lowered the U.S.’s long-term rating one level
to AA+ and kept the outlook at “negative,” saying it was
becoming less confident in lawmakers’ ability to tackle the
deficit. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed
their AAA credit ratings for the U.S. on Aug. 2, the day
President  Barack Obama  signed a bill that ended a debt-ceiling
impasse that had pushed the country to the edge of default.  “You’ve got a position here where the debt is on a rising
share if you measure it against GDP,” Chambers said. “The plan
that has been put forward and we think will be adopted gets you
part of the way there but it doesn’t get you all the way there.
And we don’t see in the next few years a consensus forming that
will get you the rest of the way.”  Five governments have gotten their AAA ratings back after
losing it, and “it’s taken them between nine and 18 years to do
so,” he said. “Usually, when you lose a AAA rating you don’t
get it back right away.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
