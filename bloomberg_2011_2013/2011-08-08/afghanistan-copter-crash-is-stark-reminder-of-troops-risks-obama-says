President  Barack Obama  said the loss
of U.S. troops in Afghanistan “is a stark reminder of the
risks” American soldiers take for their country.  “We will press on and we will succeed” in helping
Afghanistan make the transition to self-government, the
president said in a statement at the White House.  Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  called Obama yesterday to
offer condolences after 30 U.S. soldiers, 22 of them with the
elite Navy SEAL commando force, and seven Afghan soldiers were
killed in an Aug. 6 helicopter crash in eastern Afghanistan.  The deaths marked the worst single-day loss of U.S. troops
since the start of the war almost 10 years ago. The CH-47
Chinook was shot down by the Taliban, Shahidullah Shahid, a
spokesman for the Maidan Wardak province, said in a phone
interview.  Obama and Karzai “reaffirmed their commitment to the
mission in Afghanistan, which is critical to the security of
both our countries,” the White House said in a statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
