TAG Heuer, the Swiss watchmaker owned
by  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , ended its endorsement
agreement with Tiger Woods when the golfer’s contract expired
last month.  TAG Heuer, based in La Chaux-de-Fonds, had limited its use
of Woods’s image in certain markets following a November 2009
car accident that led to his admission of marital infidelity and
personal and professional decline. The company signed Woods in
2002.  Mark Steinberg , Woods’s agent, confirmed in an e-mail that
the agreement ended. He declined to provide further details.  Over the past 19 months, Woods has lost endorsement
agreements with companies including  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Accenture Plc (ACN)  and
PepsiCo Inc.’s Gatorade brand. The 14-time major champion has
maintained commercial contracts with  Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) ,  Nike
Inc. (NKE) , Upper Deck, Berkshire Hathaway’s NetJets Inc., and TLC
Vision Corp. He began promoting a muscle-relief heat rub made by
Japan-based Kowa Co. in June.  Woods, 35, hasn’t won a tournament since the 2009
Australian Masters, a week before the accident, and is 30th in
the  Official World Golf Ranking . He finished 37th yesterday in
the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational, 18 shots
behind winner  Adam Scott , who is now using Woods’s former
caddie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
