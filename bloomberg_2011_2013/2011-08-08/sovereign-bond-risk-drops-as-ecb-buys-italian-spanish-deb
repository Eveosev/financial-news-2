The cost of protecting European
 government bonds  from default dropped as the  European Central
Bank  was said to be buying Italian and Spanish sovereign debt.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps linked to the debt of 15 governments dropped 8
basis points to 278 at 4:25 p.m., the lowest since Aug. 1.
Contracts on European corporate debt jumped to the highest in
more than a year as stocks slumped.  The ECB bought Italian and Spanish government bonds,
according to five people with knowledge of the trades, after
pledging yesterday to “actively implement” its bond-purchase
program. The ECB’s failure to enter Italian and Spanish bond
markets last week helped fuel a global rout, forcing policy
makers to step up their response to  Europe ’s debt turmoil.  “It’s a positive for everything that has any tinge of risk
because you take away, in the short-term at least, the doomsday
scenario which is that Italian and Spanish bond yields continue
to rise and it’s game over for the European Union and a complete
financial meltdown,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at
Evolution Securities in London.  The cost of insuring against an Italian default tumbled 50
basis points to 337, while swaps on  Spain  dropped 66 basis
points to 342, according to CMA. The cost of insuring against a
Greek default also fell, dropping 38 basis points to 1,653, CMA
prices show, while  Portugal  declined 44 basis points to 872 and
Ireland dropped 26 basis points to 749.  U.S. credit-default swaps rose 1 basis point to 56 basis
points after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the top rating of the world’s
largest economy for the first time.  Corporate Risk Soars  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings rose 23 basis points to 573.5,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the highest since July
1 last year. The index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting
bonds against default and an increase signals deteriorating
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 3 basis points to 139.5 basis
points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers rose 3 basis points to 215 and the
subordinated index was up 10 basis points at 375.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
