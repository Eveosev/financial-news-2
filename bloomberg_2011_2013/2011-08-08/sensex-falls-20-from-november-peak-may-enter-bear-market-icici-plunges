Indian stocks slumped, dragging the
benchmark index down 20 percent from a Nov. 5 peak, after the
loss of America’s top credit rating fueled concern global
economic expansion will slow.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index lost 484.77
points, or 2.8 percent to 16,821.1 at 9:24 a.m. in Mumbai after
tumbling as much as 3 percent earlier. The gauge is headed for
its lowest close since June 9, 2010.  A decline of 20 percent or more signals a so-called bear
market to some investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
