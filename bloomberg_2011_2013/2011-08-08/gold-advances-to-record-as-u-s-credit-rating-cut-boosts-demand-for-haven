Gold climbed to a record after
 Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating, fueling a slump in
equities and commodities amid concern that the global economy is
slowing.  The  S&P 500 Index  lost as much as 5.7 percent, while the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials touched
317.6, the lowest since Dec. 17, after S&P cut the long-term
U.S. rating one level to AA+ from AAA on Aug. 5. The agency
described the outlook as “negative” and criticized the
nation’s political system for failing to adequately address
deficit reduction.  “There is heavy buying in gold because of the uncertainty
surrounding the  U.S. economy ,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“For gold, the sky is the limit.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose $61.40, or 3.7
percent, to settle at $1,713.20 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York , the biggest gain since March 19, 2009.
Earlier, the metal surged to $1,721.90, the highest ever. In
after-hours trading, it touched $1,723.40.  Prices may jump to $2,000 in the next few weeks, Zeman
said.  The precious metal has surged 21 percent in 2011, gaining
for an 11th year, as the sovereign-debt crisis and a faltering
economy boost demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  Gold is attractive “in this current macro environment,
with high risk and uncertainty surrounding the financial
markets,” said Bayram Dincer, an analyst at LGT Capital
Management in Pfaeffikon,  Switzerland . “Gold is pricing in the
one-notch downgrade as well as a component of lower global GDP
growth.”  Goldman Forecasts  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  raised its forecasts for gold
futures to $1,730 in six months and $1,860 in a year based on
expectations for real U.S. interest rates to stay lower for
longer. The previous estimates were $1,635 and $1,730, Goldman
said in a report.  Gold may advance as investors seek bullion over U.S.
Treasuries as a haven, according to  David Lennox , a resource
analyst at Fat Prophets.  “People, having rolled into U.S. Treasuries on Thursday
evening, suddenly saw that there’s still a concern with
Treasuries, and they’ve just gone back to gold,” Lennox said by
telephone from Sydney. “It’s just that knee-jerk reaction back
to the absolute, probably, safe haven, and that’s gold.”  The U.S. rating may be cut to AA within two years if
spending reductions are lower than agreed to,  interest rates 
rise or “new fiscal pressures” result in higher general
government debt, New York-based S&P said Aug. 5.  Monetary Flaws  “The happenings in the past few days highlights the flaws
in the U.S. monetary system,” Savneet Singh, the chief
executive officer of New-York based Gold Bullion International,
said in a telephone interview. “The flight to a safe haven will
continue.”  “Participants’ expectations must adjust to the real status
of the U.S. rating, which could be the perfect storm for the
gold price,” LGT’s Dincer said.  Lawmakers agreed on Aug. 2 to raise the nation’s $14.3
trillion debt ceiling and put in place a plan to enforce $2.4
trillion in spending reductions over the next 10 years, less
than the $4 trillion S&P had said it preferred.  In India and  China , the largest and second-biggest bullion
consumers, gold futures climbed to records.  Silver for September delivery rose $1.169, or 3.1 percent,
to close at $39.38 an ounce in New York.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $13.25, or
1.8 percent, to $728.50 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Platinum futures for October delivery climbed $4.50,
or 0.3 percent, to $1,723.60 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
