Total Petroleum Ghana Ltd. (TOTAL) , a unit of
Total SA, rose to the highest on record on expectations that
third-quarter profit will increase, according to Databank
Financial Services Ltd.  The shares of the biggest operator of fuel stations in the
West African nation advanced 23 pesewas, or 1.1 percent, to
22.04 cedis by the 3 p.m. close in Accra, the capital. That’s
the highest since at least October 2006, when Bloomberg began
tracking the stock.  “The fundamentals of the company are good,” Xorlali
Torsu, a stock trader at Accra-based Databank, said by phone
today. “We think the company will post higher earnings in the
third quarter,” she said, declining to give a specific
forecast.  Total  Ghana ’s first-half net income climbed 48 percent to
11.7 million cedis ($7.7 million), the company said July 27.
Revenue increased to 465.1 million cedis from 353.5 million
cedis a year earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
