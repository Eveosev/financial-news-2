The yen and Swiss franc rose versus
the majority of their counterparts as concern about a U.S.
economic slowdown and the euro-region’s debt crisis spurred
demand for the two currencies as a refuge.  The dollar fell against the euro and yen on speculation the
 Federal Reserve  today will reiterate its pledge to keep record
monetary stimulus after global equities slid.  Australia ’s dollar
erased losses that took it to below parity versus the greenback
as Asian stocks pared a decline.  “ Risk aversion  is stemming from dollar selling and euro
selling, which means demand will rise for the yen as an
alternative and the franc,” said Junichi Ishikawa, a Tokyo-
based market analyst at IG Markets Securities Ltd.  The yen rose to 77.35 per dollar as of 7:02 a.m. in  London 
from 77.77 in New York yesterday, when it climbed 0.8 percent.
The yen was at 110.18 per euro from 110.26.  The franc advanced to a record 1.0605 per euro from 1.0705
before trading at 1.0748. It was at 75.46 centimes per dollar
from 75.50 in  New York  when it touched an all-time high of
74.83. The dollar fell to $1.4245 per euro from $1.4179.  The yen has nearly erased its decline since  Japan ’s
unilateral intervention in the foreign-exchange market pushed
the currency to as low as 80.24 per dollar on Aug. 4. The  Bank
of Japan  added 10 trillion yen ($130 billion) of monetary
stimulus on Aug. 4, hours after the yen sales. BOJ Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said today that volatile exchange rates could
have a “negative impact” on the economy.  Fed’s Policy  The Federal Reserve meets today on monetary policy and may
prolong a pledge to maintain record monetary stimulus,
economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., BNP Paribas and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. The central bank could do so by making a
commitment to hold its $2.87 trillion balance sheet steady for
an “extended period.”  Fed policy makers are likely to embark on a third round of
large-scale asset purchases, moving “more decisively” to
secure the U.S. recovery, Harvard University economist  Kenneth
Rogoff  said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  “Fed officials may change their statement a bit, while it
remains to be seen whether they will signal a third round of
quantitative easing,” said Tomohiro Nishida, a Tokyo-based
foreign-currency dealer at Chuo Mitsui Trust & Banking Co. “The
bias is for the dollar to weaken.”  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners, slipped 0.2
percent to 74.591.  The yen briefly erased gains today in a spike that traders
said didn’t appear to be intervention by the BOJ. Japanese
Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said today that Group of Seven
nations didn’t discuss specifics on intervention yesterday.  Franc Gains  The franc has gained 12 percent over the past month, making
it the best performer among 10 major-economy currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen has risen 4.5
percent while the euro has declined 0.4 percent.  The dollar earlier gained against higher-yielding
currencies after a global slump in stocks prompted investors to
buy Treasuries. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares
pared its loss to 1.8 percent after falling as much as 5.5
percent. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index tumbled 6.7 percent
yesterday in New York.  U.S. two-year note yields decreased as much as six basis
points to an all-time low of 0.2283 percent yesterday, even
after Standard & Poor’s downgrade of the U.S. last week. Ten-
year yields touched the lowest since January 2009 today.  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0166 from $1.0187 after
falling to as low as 99.28 U.S. cents, the weakest since March
18. It declined 0.7 percent to 78.65 yen. The  New Zealand dollar 
depreciated to 81.78 U.S. cents from 82.09. It dropped 0.9
percent to 63.28 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
