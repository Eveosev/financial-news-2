China Steel Corp. ,  Taiwan ’s biggest
maker of the metal, said it signed a strategic alliance
agreement with Sinosteel Corp. as the Taiwanese market slowed.  The companies will strengthen cooperation in areas
including production, trading, engineering and management, the
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan-based mill said in an e-mailed
statement today, without giving financial details. Sinosteel,
with headquarters in Beijing, is controlled by the Chinese
government, according to its  website .  “China Steel probably wants to expand in the China market
through Sinosteel,” said Peter Tzeng, a Taipei-based analyst at
Polaris Securities Co. “The Taiwan market is saturated, so the
company must develop overseas markets,” said Tzeng, who has an
“equalweight” rating on the stock.  Taiwan accounted for 67 percent of  China Steel ’s sales
volume in July, down from 71 percent a year earlier, according
to the company’s  website . Taiwanese base metal producers cut
output by 7.2 percent in June from the previous month, as
“volatile” steel prices damped purchases, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said on July 25.  China Steel announced last month a 1.7 percent cut in
domestic prices for September contracts, after a 4.2 percent
decline for the July-to-August period.  Shares of China Steel fell 0.9 percent to close at NT$28.95
in Taipei trading. The stock has dropped 9.3 percent this year,
compared with the 16 percent decline in the benchmark Taiex
index.  To contact the reporter on the story:
