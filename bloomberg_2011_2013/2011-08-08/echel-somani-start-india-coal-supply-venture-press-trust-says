OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s largest miner of
metallurgical coal, and India’s Somani Group set up a joint
venture for supplies in the South Asian nation, Press Trust of
India reported.  The venture,  Mechel (MTL)  Somani Carbon, will stockpile coal on
India’s eastern coast and supply it to customers unable to
afford the cost of their own imports, the news agency said
yesterday, citing Somani Group President Atul Verma.  Mechel may ship 250,000 metric tons of coal a year to the
venture, it reported.  Ekaterina Videman, a spokeswoman for Mechel in Moscow,
confirmed the report without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
