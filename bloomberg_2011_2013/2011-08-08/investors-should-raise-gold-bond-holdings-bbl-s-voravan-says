Voravan Taraphum, managing director
of  BBL Asset Management Co. Ltd. , comments on the U.S. credit
rating downgrade, gold and Thai stocks. BBL Asset manages about
$4.9 billion of assets.  Standard & Poor’s  cut America’s top credit rating by one
level to AA+ on Aug. 5. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.6
percent today, adding to the 3.7 percent drop on Aug. 5 ahead of
the rating downgrade.  Thailand ’s benchmark SET Index lost 2.7
percent to 1,093.38 on Aug. 5.  “More and more people are talk about the double-dip
recession. Overall, the Thai bond is better in the short run.
And certainly, gold is better than other asset classes in the
medium and longer term.  “In a broader sense, If the SET index falls to 1,040, the
dividend yield at that level will be quite attractive compared
to the government bond yield.  “There is an opportunity to accumulate some stocks during
this quarter. Probably investors can wait and see as the news of
S&P’s downgrade takes effect in Asian markets on Monday
morning.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
