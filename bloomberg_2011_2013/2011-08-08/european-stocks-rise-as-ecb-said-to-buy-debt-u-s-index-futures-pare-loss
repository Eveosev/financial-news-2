European stocks erased losses, led by
a rebound in banks after the region’s central bank was said to
be buying Spanish and Italian bonds.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rallied 0.5 percent to
240.04 at 8:25 a.m. in  London , recouping losses of as much as
1.4 percent. U.S. futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
slide 0.8 percent after earlier being down as much as 3.1
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
