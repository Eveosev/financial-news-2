Coal export prices at Richards Bay,
 South Africa , Europe’s biggest source of the fuel burned for
power, rose for a third successive week on speculation demand
from the continent will climb in the fourth quarter.  Prices of thermal coal in South Africa gained 86 cents, or
0.7 percent, last week to an average $118.32 a metric ton,
according to data on Bloomberg from Petersfield, England-based
researcher IHS McCloskey. It was the longest weekly gaining
streak since March 18.  Demand for coal will rise in Europe in the fourth quarter
ahead of the Northern Hemisphere winter and as Germany pulls
back from nuclear power generation, said Miswin Mahesh, a
commodities analyst with  Barclays Capital .  “Germany is going to need more coal because it is shutting
down nuclear plants,” Mahesh said today in a phone interview.  Germany  is trying to reduce the use of nuclear power after
explosions in Japan’s Fukushima nuclear complex stoked safety
concerns in Europe’s largest economy.  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said in June she will replace Germany’s 17 reactors with a
combination of renewable sources and fossil-fuel-based
power plants. The German government is preparing to exit nuclear
generation by 2022.  To contact the reporter on this story:
