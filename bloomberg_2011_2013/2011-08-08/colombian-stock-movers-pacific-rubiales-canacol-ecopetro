The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 5 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index dropped 4.1 percent to 12,702.19, while the
Colcap Index slid 3.3 percent to 1,535.48.  Colombian stocks entered a bear market, with the IGBC index
down 22 percent from a November high, as  Standard & Poor’s 
decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA
heightened concern the global economic recovery is faltering.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in Colombia, plunged 7.9
percent to 42,060 pesos. That’s its biggest drop since December
2009. Oil today tumbled to the lowest price in more than eight
months following S&P’s downgrade.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  with fields in  South America , slid 6.4 percent to 1,620
pesos.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
slipped 1.8 percent to 3,595 pesos.  Grupo Aval SA (AVAL CB), Colombia’s biggest financial
holding company, fell 2.8 percent to 1,240 pesos. The market is
“nervous” following S&P’s downgrade, leading investors to drop
“riskier” assets such as emerging-market stocks, said Jose
Fernando Restrepo, the head analyst at Interbolsa SA,  Colombia ’s
biggest brokerage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
