Polyus Gold International Ltd., the
mining company formerly known as KazakhGold Group Ltd., said it
has 3 million ounces of reserves in  Kazakhstan  and  Romania .  The total is backdated to May and conforms to the JORC code
of practice, the Moscow-based company said today in a regulatory
statement. At current rates of production, the reserves will
allow Polyus to mine gold in the region for 27 years.  The company produced 110,000 ounces of gold in Kazakhstan
last year, according to  data  on its website. Polyus hasnâ€™t yet
started extraction in Romania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
