China â€™s central bank raised its
reference rate for the yuan by 0.23 percent to 6.4305 per
dollar, the biggest gain since November.  The currency is allowed to trade as much as 0.5 percent on
either side of the daily fixing, which was set at the strongest
level since a dollar peg ended in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
