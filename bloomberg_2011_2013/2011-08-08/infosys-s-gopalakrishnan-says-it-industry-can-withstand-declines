S. Gopalakrishnan, chief executive
officer of Infosys Ltd.,  India ’s second-largest software
exporter, comments on the impact of the U.S. credit-rating
downgrade on the information-technology industry. Sixty-six
percent of Infosys’s revenue came from  North America  in the year
ended March 2011.  He responded to questions in an e-mail today.  “It is too early to say. There are fears of another
recession in the U.S. and a debt crisis in  Europe . We were able
to react very quickly in the past (2008) when the recession
happened.  ‘‘These responses are still fresh in our memory and I
believe that the industry may be able to withstand another
global downturn.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
