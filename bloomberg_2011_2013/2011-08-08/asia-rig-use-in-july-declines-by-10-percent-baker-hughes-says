Rigs used by energy explorers in Asia
fell 10 percent in July from a year earlier as global crude  oil
prices  slid, according to data compiled by  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The Asia-Pacific region used 244 rigs on land and sea last
month, compared with 272 a year earlier, Baker Hughes, an
oilfield services company, said on its  website .  Rig use has declined from a 26-year high of 286 in January
as oil slumped 26 percent from this year’s peak of $114.83 a
barrel in May. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for about 21
percent of global rig use, excluding the U.S. and Canada.  Globally, there were 3,397 rigs operating last month, 365
more than a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes. The
international rig count, excluding the U.S. and Canada, stood at
1,150 last month compared with 1,109 a year earlier, Baker
Hughes said. The figures include offshore and onshore drill
sites and exclude those in  Iran  and onshore in  China .  Baker Hughes has published rig counts since 1944, when
Hughes Tool Co. began weekly data on U.S. and Canadian drilling,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
