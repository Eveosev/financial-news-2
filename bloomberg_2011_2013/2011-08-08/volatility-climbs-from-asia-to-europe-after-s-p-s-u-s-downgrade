Option prices in  Europe  and Asia
jumped, sending the South Korean volatility index to its highest
level in more than two years, after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped
the U.S. of its top  credit rating  for the first time.  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of protecting
against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, climbed
8.1 percent to 42.43 as of 2:06 p.m. in Frankfurt. Hong Kong’s
HSI Volatility Index advanced 6.1 percent to 35.93. The Kospi
200 Volatility Index surged 25 percent to 35.26, its highest
level since May 2009, while the India VIX, which gauges the cost
of buying protection against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index,
rose 16 percent to 28.78, its highest level since June 2010.  “We’re in for another stomach-churning week,” Nick Maroutsos, a Sydney-based  money manager  who oversees the
equivalent of about $4 billion at Kapstream Capital, said on
Bloomberg Television’s “First Up” with Susan Li today. “This
is a life-changing event in many respects because no-one has
ever seen the U.S. have a double-A status. We’re going to see a
lot of volatility this week.”  Stocks tumbled from Hong Kong to Mumbai and  Frankfurt ,
sending benchmark Asian and European indexes down as much as 20
percent from their peaks, on concern the global economy is
slowing and the U.S. may enter a recession. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index earlier gained after five people with knowledge of the
matter said the ECB bought Italian and Spanish government bonds.
Gold jumped to a record and the Swiss franc climbed to an all-
time high against the  U.S. dollar .  S&P Downgrade  S&P lowered the long-term credit rating of the world’s
largest economy to AA+ from AAA after U.S. equity markets closed
on Aug. 5. S&P said it cut the credit rating because a deal
struck last week to raise the federal debt ceiling and cut the
budget didn’t go far enough and the agency now believes the
political divide in  Washington  is such that meaningful progress
on debt-reduction is less likely than previously assumed.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index, which entered a so-called
correction last week after falling more than 10 percent from a
May peak, lost 2.5 percent to 122.88. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
dropped 1.9 percent to 234.46. In the U.S.,  S&P 500  futures
expiring in September declined 2.1 percent to 1,172.80 on
concern consumer and business confidence will deteriorate.  Volatility soared last week before the credit-rating cut as
investors snapped up options to protect stocks amid growing
concern the U.S. may slip into a recession and that Europe can’t
contain its sovereign-debt crisis.  Volatility Spikes  “Sovereign U.S. debt rating changes will feed into the
high volatility that we are in,” Gaurav Mehta, a derivatives
analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Ambit Capital, said today in a
telephone interview. “We expect India VIX to spike all the way
to 35.”  The measure of Indian option prices has averaged about 21.6
since the beginning of 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  The HSI Volatility Index of options of the  Hang Seng Index 
surged 56 percent on Aug. 5, the biggest one-day gain since data
on the index began in 2001. The gauge has almost doubled in the
past week. The VStoxx Index gained for a ninth day, extending
its longest rising streak on record, after jumping 42 percent
last week. The Euro Stoxx 50 stock index today fell 1 percent
for an 11th day of losses, the longest losing streak on record.  The VDAX-New,  Germany ’s benchmark gauge of the country’s
stock-market volatility, added 9.7 percent to 38.77 in Frankfurt
for its ninth rising day, the longest streak ever. The measure
is derived from prices paid for options on the  DAX Index (DAX) , which
dropped 2.3 percent to 6,090.57. The index now has fallen for
nine consecutive days, the longest falling streak since 1990.  VIX Up  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, jumped 27 percent last week to 32, the highest
since July 2010 for the gauge of S&P 500 options as investors
turned to the options market for protection. VIX futures
expiring this month rose 6.9 percent to 31.15, while September’s
gained 5.9 percent to 27.75.  Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said
yesterday he expects stocks will keep slumping after S&P cut the
U.S. credit rating.  “Considering the momentum in which the market went down
over the last week, it is very unlikely, if history is any
guide, that this isn’t going to take a while to bottom out,”
Greenspan told NBC’s “Meet the Press” program.  U.S. stocks have slumped for two straight weeks as reports
on manufacturing and consumer spending showed the world’s
largest economy is slowing. The S&P 500 has retreated 11 percent
since July 22, the biggest loss over the same amount of time
since March 2009, when the equity bull market began.  More than 39 million options on stocks, indexes and
exchange-traded funds changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Aug. 5,
according to a preliminary tally by the Chicago-based OCC, which
settles all trades. That topped an Aug. 4 record of 36.1 million
contracts and a prior high before this week of 30.8 million on
May 6, 2010, when a 20-minute rout erased $862 billion from the
value of U.S. shares before stocks rebounded.  To contact the reporters on this story:
