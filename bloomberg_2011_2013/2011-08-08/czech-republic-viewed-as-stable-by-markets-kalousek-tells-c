The  Czech Republic  continues to be
viewed by investors as a ‘very boring and stable’ country with a
‘strong’ drive toward reigning in fiscal spending and
consolidating state finances, Czech Finance Minister Miroslav
Kalousek told CT24.  The Czech government’s efforts to consolidate the state
finance are the fundamental reasons for the country’s
credibility on the financial markets, Kalousek told the state-
run television channel today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
