Exports of  palm oil  from Indonesia,
the world’s largest producer, gained 10 percent in the first
half from a year earlier supported by strong demand from India
and  China , an industry group said.  Overseas sales rose to 8.2 million metric tons in the six
months ended June 30 from 7.47 million tons a year ago, the
 Indonesian Palm Oil Association , known as Gapki, said in a
statement posted on its website dated Aug. 5. Gapki doesn’t
provide export figures to India and China.  “The cut of palm oil export tax in August from 20 percent
to 15 percent was expected to make Indonesian palm oil more
competitive in the world market, in turn it will increase
export,” Gapki said in the statement.  Increased shipments from  Indonesia  may help to extend a
decline in palm oil prices that have fallen about 21 percent
this year. October-delivery contract dropped 1.9 percent to
2,994 ringgit ($991.7) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange as of 5:23 p.m. Jakarta time.  Total exports will reach around 18 million tons this year
as strong demand will persist into the second half, Gapki said.
Shipments were 15.65 million tons last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
