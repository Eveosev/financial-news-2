U.K. stocks climbed for a third day,
the biggest three-day rally on the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  since April
2009, as better-than-forecast Japanese economic growth reassured
some investors that the global recovery is intact.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
gained 4.1 percent amid optimism that demand for metals will
increase.  Spectris Plc (SXS)  rallied 4.3 percent after the maker of
instruments and controls agreed to buy U.S. manufacturer Omega
Engineering on a debt and cash-free basis.  The FTSE 100 Index climbed 30.55, or 0.6 percent, to
5,350.58 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending last week’s
gain. Stocks rallied last week after the largest increase in
U.S. retail sales in four months tempered concern that economic
growth is slowing. The gauge has rallied 6.9 percent in the past
three days. The FTSE All-Share Index advanced 0.6 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index surged 1.3 percent.  The FTSE 100 had declined 16 percent from the beginning of
July through Aug. 10, wiping more than $566 billion from the
value of U.K. shares, as investors speculated that  Europe  would
fail to contain its sovereign-debt crisis and that the U.S.’s
economic recovery would falter. The slump has pushed down the
gauge’s price-to-earnings ratio to 9.5 times the estimated
earnings of its constituent companies, below the average
multiple of 11.5 over the last five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our central scenario is that we are not going to face a
double dip,” said Richard Lacaille, chief investment officer at
Boston-based State Street Global Advisors Inc., which has $2.1
trillion in assets, in a Bloomberg Television interview in
London. “Valuation indicators are showing that markets are
becoming more interesting, more attractive.”  Japan ’s GDP  Japan’s gross domestic product shrank at an annualized 1.3
percent rate in the three months ended June 30. The median
forecast of 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 2.5
percent drop.  Fresnillo rallied 4.1 percent to 1,796 pence. Contracts to
buy silver for September delivery climbed as much as 1.4
percent.  Oil-services companies climbed after Transocean Ltd., the
world’s largest offshore driller, offered to buy Norway’s Aker
Drilling ASA for 7.9 billion kroner ($1.5 billion) to expand its
fleet of rigs able to drill in deep water and rough seas.  Amec
Plc (AMEC)  soared 4.8 percent to 949 pence and Wood Group Plc gained
1.6 percent to 568 pence.  Spectris rallied 4.3 percent to 1,407 pence. The maker of
instruments and controls said it paid $475 million to acquire
Omega Engineering, funding the deal from cash and bank loans.  Michael Page International Plc (MPI)  plunged 8.1 percent to 368
pence, its largest drop since October 2008, as the U.K.
recruitment company said gross profit growth is slowing in the
banking industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
