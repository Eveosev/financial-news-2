A.S. Firoz, chief economist at
India’s steel ministry, comments on the impact of the U.S.
credit rating downgrade on India.  Indian shares plunged today after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
the U.S. credit rating one level to AA+ from AAA, stoking
concern that a slowdown in the world’s biggest economy will
worsen.  India’s benchmark Sensitive Index fell as much as 3.2
percent, led by  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable
company, which sank to its lowest level in more than two years.
 Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker that controls U.S.-
based Novelis Inc., sank 5.2 percent. Infosys Ltd., the second-
largest software exporter, declined as much as 4.9 percent.  “The downgrade indicates a global slowdown that will
impact manufacturing sectors. The growth in export-oriented
sectors in India will be impacted because of this slowdown.  “Coupled with high  interest rates , India’s economic growth
may falter. The country will be better positioned in facing this
new challenge from the west, by increasing supplies and pushing
up productivity, so that inflation and interest rates can come
down and demand could rise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
