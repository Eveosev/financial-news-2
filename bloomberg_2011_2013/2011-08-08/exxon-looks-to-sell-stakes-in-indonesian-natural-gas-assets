Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest publicly traded oil company, said it’s trying to sell
its interests in some Indonesian natural-gas operations that are
part of an ongoing lawsuit.  The properties include the Arun field and satellite fields,
and the North Sumatra Offshore field, David Eglinton, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The assets had annual average net
production of 215 million cubic feet a day of gas last year, as
well as some liquids, Eglinton said.  In July, a U.S. appeals court reinstated a lawsuit thrown
out by a lower court, ruling that Exxon must face allegations
that it aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by
its security forces in  Indonesia ’s Aceh province. At the time,
Exxon said it has “fought these baseless claims for many
years.” Today, the company asked the full appeals court to
review the three-judge panel’s decision.  The attempt to sell assets in Indonesia is consistent with
the company’s “long-standing practice of continually reviewing
assets for their contribution to Exxon Mobil’s operating and
financial objectives, as well as their potential value to
others,” Eglinton said in the statement today.  The asset sale “has nothing to do with the Aceh lawsuit,”
he said. Eglinton said the sales process doesn’t involve other
Exxon projects in Indonesia. Exxon and predecessor companies
have operated in Indonesia for more than 100 years and will
retain “an active presence” in the country, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
