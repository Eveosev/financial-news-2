Our ranking of family offices is
based on data compiled by Bloomberg from information self-
reported by family-office firms.  Bloomberg surveyed more than 1,000  money management  firms
worldwide, using a database obtained from  Portland , Oregon-based
Family Offices Group. More than 130 firms responded; we ranked
the top 50 by assets under management.  We requested that each family-office firm exclude money
they manage for pension funds and other institutions and include
funds managed for private foundations.  Family offices are included in the ranking only if they
provide both comprehensive investment and non-investment
services to multi-generational families. Seventy-six percent of
the ranked family offices manage family assets directly, while
24 percent provide only investment-advisory services and
outsource money management.  The ranked firms provide a wide variety of non-investment
services, including organizing family meetings, art consulting,
estate planning, foundation management and concierge services
such as property management, private travel arrangements and
shopping assistance.  Private banks are included if the bank has a unit that
offers direct and comprehensive investment and noninvestment
services to families.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
