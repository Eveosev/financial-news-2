N. Chandrasekaran, chief executive
officer of  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , comments on the
impact of the U.S. credit-rating downgrade and market movement
on the information-technology industry. Tata Consultancy,
 India ’s largest software exporter, got 54 percent of revenue
from clients in  North America  in the year ended March 31.  Chandrasekaran responded to questions in an e-mail today.  “We do not see any material impact from the sell-off in
global markets. We are watchful of the evolving global situation
but do not see any changes in the business demand environment in
North America and  Europe .  ‘‘We continue to work closely with our customers to help
implement their business plans in a volatile environment.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
