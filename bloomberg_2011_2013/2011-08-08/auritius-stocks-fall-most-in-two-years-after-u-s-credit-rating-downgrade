Mauritian stocks fell, sending the
benchmark index down the most in more than two years, and the
rupee weakened after a credit rating downgrade of the U.S.
damped demand for assets in  developing countries .  The 38-member SEMDEX Index of stocks declined for a second
consecutive day, losing 2.8 percent to 1,942.66 at the 1:30 p.m.
close in  Port Louis , the capital, the biggest drop since July
2009. Mauritius Commercial Bank, the country’s largest lender by
market value, dropped 3.4 percent. New Mauritius Hotels Ltd.,
the Indian Ocean Island nation’s largest leisure operator by
turnover, lost 2.1 percent. The rupee sank 0.1 percent to
28.1550 against the dollar.  Mauritian stocks wiped out this year’s gains after the U.S.
lost its AAA rating for the first time at  Standard & Poor’s .
Stocks fell from Shanghai to Moscow as investors retreated from
riskier assets, sending the MSCI Emerging Markets Index 2.6
percent lower, capping the steepest five-day slump since
November 2008.  “The U.S credit downgrade is likely to trigger a major
shock to global risk appetite,” London-based Societe Generale
SA’s analysts, led by  Benoit Anne , said in an e-mailed research
note today. “There is no indication that some emerging markets
will weather the shock. This will probably include the more
exotic frontier markets.”  Mauritius, with a population of 1.3 million, has reduced
preliminary growth forecasts to 4 percent for 2012-2014, as its
recovery path is dampened by lower investment and international
financial climate, the Ministry of Finance said last week. The
government had estimated growth 4.3 percent in 2012 and 4.5
percent in 2013, according to budget figures in November.  Mauritius is a net importer of food and fuels, with 67
percent of its import bills denominated in dollars.  Europe  is
the country’s main trading partner for tourism and textiles, its
two main sources of foreign currency revenue, according to the
 Central Statistics Office .  To contact the reporter on this story:
