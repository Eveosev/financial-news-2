Russia’s dollar-denominated RTS Index
headed for its biggest drop in more than 14 months as
commodities prices declined after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the AAA
rating on the U.S. government’s debt.  The index slid 5.4 percent to 1,701.80 as of 5:20 p.m. in
Moscow, poised for its sharpest decline since May 25, 2010.  OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , a Russian coal producer, plunged 24
percent. OAO Novatek, the country’s second-biggest natural gas
producer, slid 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
