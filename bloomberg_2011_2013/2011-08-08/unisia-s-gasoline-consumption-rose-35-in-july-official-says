Tunisian gasoline consumption
increased by 35 percent in July compared with a year earlier,
said Khaled Qadour, the director general of energy at the
Ministry of Industry and Technology.  The demand gain was partly because of increased shipments
to  Libya , where Muammar Qaddafi’s government has struggled to
import fuel supplies from the international market since
fighting began in February, he said.  Many oil facilities were affected by strikes last month,
including the Askhira refinery in the southern Sfax governorate
that lasted six days, Qadour said. The dispute also led to
reduced field works with the drilling of six exploration wells
out of a planned 14 for this year and four development wells of
14 scheduled, which crimped output, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
