China ’s stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index down 20 percent from a Nov. 8 high, as the loss
of America’s top credit rating fueled concern global economic
growth will slow.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, slumped 122.68 points, or 4.7 percent,
to 2,503.74 at 11:09 a.m. local time, set for the biggest
decline since Nov. 12 and the lowest close since July 19, 2010.
A decline of 20 percent or more signals a so-called bear market
to some investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
