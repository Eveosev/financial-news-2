The biggest global banks are cutting
jobs at the fastest rate since 2008 as a weak U.S. economy
squeezes revenue, regulators push firms to hold more capital and
companies restructure businesses to improve profitability.  The 50 largest banks, including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , disclosed plans for
almost 60,000 reductions since Jan. 1, according to company
statements and data compiled by Bloomberg Industries. At that
pace, they’ll cut more than 101,000 jobs this year -- the most
since 192,000 positions were targeted in 2008 amid loan losses,
a global credit crunch and unprecedented government bailouts.  HSBC’s aim to shed 30,000 workers, unveiled by the London-
based firm on Aug. 1, was the single biggest job-cutting
announcement since Bank of America said in December 2008 that it
would eliminate as many as 35,000 positions, the data show.  Persistent low interest rates, stagnant loan growth and new
rules for  debit cards  will crimp U.S. bank earnings this year.
Global regulators, seeking to avoid a repeat of the financial
crisis and blunt the impact of potential European sovereign debt
defaults, are pushing banks to hold more capital. Firms
including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  are seeking to pare costs in
some countries while expanding in faster-growing economies, such
as China, India and  Brazil .  The following table lists global banks, including those
outside the 50 largest, that have announced at least 500 job
cuts so far this year, as well as their total employees as of
Dec. 31, according to Bloomberg data. For companies that
disclosed a range of reductions, the table shows the top limit.
Many reductions are being made over months or years, and some
firms have said they are simultaneously hiring in other areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
