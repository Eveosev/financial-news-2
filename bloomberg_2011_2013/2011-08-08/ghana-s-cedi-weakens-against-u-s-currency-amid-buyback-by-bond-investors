Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for a third
day as investors whose bids were not accepted in a July 28
auction of five-year bonds by the central bank, bought back
dollars to transfer funds.  The currency of the world’s second biggest cocoa producer
weakened as much as 0.07 percent to 1.5196, before trading at
1.5187 as of 1:23 p.m. in Accra, the capital, according data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The currency weakened amid demand from investors that did
not get their bids accepted in the central bank’s five-year bond
auction,” Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the local unit of
Standard Chartered Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview
today. “Those offshore investors, who initially sold dollars to
buy the bonds, bought back the dollars today to transfer the
funds.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
