The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
closed at its lowest level since Sept. 10, falling 865.57, or 3
percent, to 28,391.18 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  African Oxygen Ltd. (AFX)  , the largest producer of
industrial gases in Africa, fell 7.3 percent to 19 rand after
the company said circumstances which may have affected the price
of its shares “are no longer relevant.”  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up 10 percent of the benchmark stock index, closed at its lowest
since Aug. 31, 2010, dropping 14.76 rand, or 5.1 percent, to
273.84 rand. Copper slid to the lowest level in more than two
months after  Standard & Poor’s  cut its U.S. credit rating,
fueling concern that an American economic slowdown will reduce
demand for metal.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, fell for an eleventh day, declining 11.02 rand, or 4.9
percent, to 211.93 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, rose for the first day in three, adding 7.19 rand, or
2.4 percent, to 301.89 rand. Gold climbed to more than $1,700 an
ounce for the first time after the U.S. rating cut spurred
demand for assets that provide a haven.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , the coal miner that exports
about 38 percent of its production, retreated for a fifth day,
its longest losing streak in 11 weeks, falling 8 rand, or 4.8
percent, to 159 rand. India’s power-station coal imports from
 South Africa  declined 39 percent in July from a year earlier,
according to India Coal Market Watch, published by Kolkata-based
online trading company Mjunction Services Ltd.  Pretoria Portland Cement Co Ltd. (PPC)  , a South African
maker of the building material, dropped 5.3 percent to 23.10
rand, its lowest level since June 2005. South Africa cement

earlier, compared with a growth rate of 10.2 percent in June,
the Johannesburg-based Cement & Concrete Institute said today.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, closed at its lowest level since Sept. 23,
sliding 7.62 rand, or 2.4 percent, to 306.83 rand. Oil plunged
in  New York  after the U.S. credit-rating cut by S&P, stoking
concern that an economic slowdown in the world’s biggest crude
consumer will worsen and cut fuel demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
