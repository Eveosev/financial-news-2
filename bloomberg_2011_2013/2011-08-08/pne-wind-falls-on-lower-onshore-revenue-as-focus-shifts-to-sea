PNE Wind AG (PNE3) , a German wind-power
developer, fell to the lowest price in almost seven months in
Frankfurt trading after a decline in onshore projects cut first-
half sales.  PNE Wind slumped 12.8 euro cents, or 7.7 percent, to 1.525
euros as of 5:30 p.m. local time, the lowest close since Jan.
12. The shares lost 16 percent last week.  Sales dropped to 16.6 million euros ($23.6 million) in the
first half from 41.1 million euros a year earlier after PNE Wind
built fewer wind farms on land as it plans a larger offshore
business, the Cuxhaven-based company said today in a website
 statement .  The developer has shifted its focus to offshore projects
amid a drive by  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government to install
10,000 megawatts of  wind turbines  at sea by the end of the
decade, pre-empting a power gap as the country phases out
nuclear generation by 2022.  The slump in sales can be attributed to the timing of
projects, according to Rainer Heinsohn, a company spokesman.  “Revenues depend on projects, and if we have projects
early in the year, we have earnings early in the year,”
Heinsohn said today by telephone. The company is focusing on its
252-megawatt Gode Wind II venture under development in the  North
Sea , Heinsohn said.  PNE Wind plans to start building Gode Wind II, which will
have 84 turbines from Vestas Wind Systems A/S, next year. The
company has received 10 written expressions of interest from
European banks to finance the wind farm, with contributions of
50 million euros to 100 million euros each, according to its
financial report published today. PNE Wind expects to complete
funding negotiations “soon,” the company said.  Earnings before interest and tax fell to 950,000 euros in
the first half from 8.2 million euros a year earlier. Ebit in
fiscal 2011 to 2013 will “grow to a cumulative value of at
least 60 million euros to 72 million euros,” PNE Wind said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
