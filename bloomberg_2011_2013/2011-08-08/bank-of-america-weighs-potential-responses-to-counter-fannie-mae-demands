Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said it is
weighing how to counter Fannie Mae’s more aggressive demands
that the bank repurchase faulty mortgages as Chief Executive
Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  seeks to reverse a share slide.  “We are considering a number of potential responses to
this changed behavior,” the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based
lender said in a memo distributed to employees and dated Aug. 7.
“It is unknown whether Fannie Mae’s continuing claims will
result in increased representation and warranty liability.”  Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, is
seeking to assure staff and investors that the company can
withstand investor demands for compensation on soured loans.
American International Group Inc. today sued the bank to recover
more than $10 billion in losses on mortgages, and government
sponsored enterprises including  Fannie Mae  have been demanding
more reimbursement following a $3 billion deal in January.  “Fannie Mae has modified its approach to repurchase
claims, including claims on loans where over two years’ worth of
payments have been made in a way that diverges from our
longstanding course of dealing with them,” according to the
memo. “We believe, however, that we have properly accrued for
all GSE representation and warranty exposure taking into
consideration this changed behavior to date.”  Bank of America dropped $1.16, or 14 percent, to $7.01 at
12:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
company has slumped by almost half this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
