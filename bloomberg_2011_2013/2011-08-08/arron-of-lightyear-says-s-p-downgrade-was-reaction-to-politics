Donald Marron , founder and chairman
of Lightyear Capital LLC, said Standard & Poor’s cutting of the
U.S. debt rating was a response to Washington politics, not an
indication of the country’s economic condition.  “We are still an AAA country,” Marron said in a Bloomberg
Television interview with  Tom Keene . “This was a political
downgrade. It was not a business or economic downgrade. That’s
not to say it wasn’t a warning for us all that we are seen in a
much more fragile state, partly because of what we saw in
Washington.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
