Muahammad Nazaruddin, the fugitive
former treasurer of  Indonesia ’s Democrat party, may have been
captured in Columbia, Djoko Suyanto, coordinating minister for
politics, law and security, told reporters today.  The Indonesian ambassador in Columbia informed the Foreign
Ministry in Jakarta late yesterday that Interpol had detained a
person suspected to be Nazaruddin, Suyanto said.  “The person captured in Columbia is physically identical
with Nazaruddin,” Suyanto said, adding that the government will
send a team for further investigation.  In June, the  Corruption Eradication Commission  named
Nazaruddin as a suspect in a bribery case. Nazaruddin, who has
fled the country, is accused of accepting bribes associated with
buildings for the Southeast Asia Games to be held in November.  Nazaruddin said in an interview  broadcast  July 19 on Metro
TV he fled the country because the investigation was politically
motivated. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who helped secure a second
five-year term in 2009 by promising to clean up graft, called on
Nazaruddin to return to Indonesia and face legal proceedings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
