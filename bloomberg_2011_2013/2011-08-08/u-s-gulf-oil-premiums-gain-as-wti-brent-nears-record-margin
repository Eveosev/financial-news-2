U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
as the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to
Brent widened to a record margin.  The gap increased 33 cents to $22.82 a barrel as of 12:59
p.m. in  New York . The Aug. 2 difference of $22.67 was a record
based on closing prices.  When Brent increases versus WTI, it strengthens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 50 cents to $24.25
a barrel at 12:24 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 65 cents a barrel to
$25 over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 15 cents to $20 while Poseidon’s premium gained 35
cents to $19.85 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 25 cents to
$18.25 a barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount was
unchanged at $1. Thunder Horse’s premium added 25 cents a barrel
to $24.75.  The premium for Syncrude for September delivery gained 85
cents to $15 a barrel yesterday. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur
synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 40 cents to
$14.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
