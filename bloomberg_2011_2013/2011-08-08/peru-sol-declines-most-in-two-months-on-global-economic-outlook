Peru’s sol fell the most in two
months as concern the global economy is slowing sapped demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The sol weakened 0.5 percent to 2.7547 per  U.S. dollar  at
11:21 a.m. New York time, from 2.7406 yesterday. That’s the
currency’s steepest decline since June 6.  Investors are retreating from emerging-market assets amid
growing risks to the global recovery after Standard & Poor’s cut
the U.S. long-term credit rating one level to AA+ and as
Europe’s debt crisis deepened. The European Central Bank
purchased Italian and Spanish debt after yields on 10-year
Italian debt rose to a euro area record last week.  “The downgrade complicates the situation for the  U.S.
economy  and the risk of a second recession,” said Gonzalo Navarro, head trader at  Banco Santander  in Lima. “The downgrade
should weaken the dollar in the medium term, but for now the
flight to quality is taking precedent over everything else.”  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries jumped 19 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 200, a six-week high, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Lima General Index of stocks tumbled 4.3 percent to
19,291.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
