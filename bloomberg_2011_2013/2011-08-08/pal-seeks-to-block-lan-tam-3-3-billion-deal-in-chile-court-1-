Chile ’s Pal Airlines filed a court
request to block  Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ’s planned $3.3 billion takeover
of  Brazil ’s  Tam SA (TAMM4) , a merger that could create the world’s
third-largest airline by market value.  Pal Airlines  presented a request to Chile’s Constitutional
Court on Aug. 3 to declare the purchase unconstitutional,
according to data posted on the court’s website.  Chile’s Antitrust Tribunal, known as TDLC, is reviewing the
takeover and may announce its ruling this month. Pal argued in
its filing that if the TDLC approves the deal, any mitigation
measures proposed will be taken from an out-of-court agreement
Lan and Tam reached in January with Chile’s National Economic
Prosecutor prior to the review by the TDLC.  “That would create a conflict that the Constitutional
Court should rule upon,” Pal lawyer Mario Fernandez wrote,
according to data on the Tribunal’s website.  The constitutional court will review Pal’s request Aug. 10
at 11 a.m. New York time, according to its website.  An official at Lan’s corporate communications department
didn’t immediately respond to a phone request for comment.
Cristobal Pinto, head of marketing of Pal Airlines, said that
the company’s legal department would comment in a press
conference later this week and declined to provide more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
