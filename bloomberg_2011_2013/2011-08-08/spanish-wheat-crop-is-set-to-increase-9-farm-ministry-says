Spain ’s wheat harvest is set to rise
9 percent this year, the  Agriculture Ministry  said, better than
the outlook for little-changed production a month earlier. It
also projected higher barley output.  The wheat crop will increase to 6.36 million metric tons,
the ministry said in a  report  on its website based on conditions
as of May 31. Soft-wheat production will rise 8.3 percent to
5.29 million tons, the report showed.  Spain had a wetter-than-usual spring, boosting winter-grain
yields, the European Union’s crop-monitoring unit said in a
 report  dated July 26. Abundant rains filled reservoirs, meaning
there probably will be no water constraints on corn irrigation,
according to the EU unit.  Barley production will climb 3.7 percent to 8.45 million
tons, the ministry said. Spain’s corn harvest will advance 12
percent to 3.69 million tons, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
