European stocks dropped, extending a
rout that has wiped off more than $5 trillion from global equity
values, after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded U.S. debt. U.S. stock
futures and Asian shares tumbled.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio Tinto Group led a selloff in
mining companies as base metal prices fell in London. Energy
shares fell as crude oil plunged in  New York .  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
surged 5.2 percent and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  jumped 2.6 percent as
European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled
he’s ready to start buying Italian and Spanish bonds.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index sank 1.1 percent to
236.19 at 8:03 a.m. in London, extending last week’s 9.9 percent
selloff. The benchmark measure has lost 19 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 17 amid concern Europe will fail to contain
its sovereign-debt crisis as U.S. growth stalls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
