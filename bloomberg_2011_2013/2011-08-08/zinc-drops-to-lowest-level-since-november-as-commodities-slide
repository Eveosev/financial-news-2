Zinc fell to the lowest level since
November on the London Metal Exchange as commodities and
equities tumbled after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit
rating, spurring concern about demand.  Zinc paced declines in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities, which fell as much as 2.8 percent. The
 U.S. economy  is heading into a “double-dip” recession,  Nouriel
Roubini , the co-founder and chairman of New York-based Roubini
Global Economics LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television.  “Zinc currently exhibits the weakest fundamental data,”
said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
Frankfurt. “Furthermore, the dive below $2,100 means that an
important technical level was broken that has probably
intensified the down move. We will probably see prices below
$2,000.”  Zinc for three-month delivery on the LME dropped as much as
7.5 percent to $2,034.25 a metric ton, the lowest level since
Nov. 17. It traded at $2,075.25 by 4:40 p.m. London time.  Zinc inventories monitored by the LME have remained above
880,000 tons after rising to 894,825 tons on July 11, the
highest level in more than 16 years, according to daily exchange
figures.  Zinc is poised for a 422,000-ton surplus this year,
according to Briesemann.  To contact the reporter on this story:
