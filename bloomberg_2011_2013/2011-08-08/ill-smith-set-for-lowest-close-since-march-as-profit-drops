Hill & Smith Holdings Plc (HILS) , a supplier
of motorway barriers, headed for its lowest closing level in
London trading since March after reporting a 25 percent drop in
first-half underlying pretax profit.  Shares in the Solihull, U.K.-based company fell 4.2 percent
to 300 pence at 9:21 a.m. in London, a fifth day of declines.  “This is a disappointing set of numbers from Hill and
Smith,” analysts at Altium Securities wrote in a note to
clients today. “The top line has held up but at the expense of
margin and with subdued demand set to continue for the
foreseeable future.”  Altium lowered its recommendation on the stock to “Hold”
from “Buy” and cut its forecasts for the company’s adjusted
pretax profit for 2011 and next year.  Hill and Smith posted an underlying pretax profit of 16.2
million pounds ($26.6 million) for the six months ended June 30,
down from 21.5 million pounds in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 0.8 percent to 195.1 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
