Astral Operations Ltd., Elite
Breeding Farms and Ross Poultry Breeders Ltd. have asked  South
Africa â€™s Competition Tribunal to set aside a complaint brought
against the companies by  Country Bird Holdings Ltd. (CBH)  and Supreme
Poultry on technical grounds, Business Report said, citing
company lawyers.  The three companies are arguing that the case brought
against them differs from the original complaint, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
