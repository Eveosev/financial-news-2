C. Rajendra Prasad, managing director
of  CCL Products India Ltd. (CCLP) , the nation’s biggest instant-coffee
exporter, comments on the impact of the debt crisis in  Europe  on
shipments.  Robusta coffee for September delivery fell as much as 1.5
percent to $2,032 a metric ton on on NYSE Liffe in London and
Arabica coffee for December delivery slumped as much as 1.9
percent to $2.3725 a pound in New York. Europe accounts for more
than 75 percent of India’s annual coffee exports of about
300,000 tons.  Prasad spoke in a phone interview from Guntur in south
India.  On coffee demand:  “The debt crisis in Europe does not affect us. There will
be no decline in exports. We produce 300,000 tons, which is less
than 2 to 3 percent of world coffee production. Indian coffee is
more expensive and known for its quality. It is used mostly for
blending purposes.  ‘‘We are insignificant in the global coffee market.
International markets affect Brazil, Vietnam and  Colombia , which
make 70 per cent of the world’s coffee producers.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
