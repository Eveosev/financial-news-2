Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services
lowered its credit quality ratings on 73 funds that hold  U.S.
debt  after downgrading the nation’s long-term rating for the
first time.  The portfolios include fixed-income funds, exchange-traded
funds,  hedge funds , as well as local government investment pools
and unit investment trusts, New York-based Standard & Poor’s
said today in a statement. The company cut the ratings by as
much as two notches for the funds, 70 of which previously had
the highest rating of “AAAf,” S&P said.  The list of funds that had their ratings downgraded include
those sold by firms such as Federated Investors Inc. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., and government pools such as the City of
Anaheim in California. Certain ETFs sold by BlackRock Inc. and
State Street Corp. were also affected.  S&P said it lowered the ratings on 73 of 206 funds managed
in the U.S.,  Europe  and Bermuda because of their “significant
exposures,” greater than 50 percent to direct or indirect
investments, in U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency
securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
