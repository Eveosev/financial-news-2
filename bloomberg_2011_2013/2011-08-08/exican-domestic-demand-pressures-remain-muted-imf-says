Mexico ’s central bank has room to
decide on the timing of interest rate increases as domestic
demand pressures remain “muted,” the  International Monetary
Fund  said today in a report on the country’s finances.  The Washington-based lender said Mexico’s economy will
expand 4.5 percent this year, less than the 4.7 percent it
projected in June. In 2012, the economy should expand 4.1
percent, compared with a June estimate of 4 percent.  “A more protracted slowdown in the U.S., particularly if
it involved manufacturing, would represent a material drag to
Mexico’s growth given its close integration with the U.S.
economy,” the IMF said in a report posted on its  website  today.  Investment inflows are continuing into the country despite
concern in global markets as Europe seeks to stem its debt
crisis, Mexican Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said today in
comments broadcast by Radio Formula. There is unlikely to be a
“restrictive” monetary policy, Cordero said.  Inflation is “benign” and inflation expectations are
“firmly anchored”, the IMF said in the report. The
appreciation of the  Mexican peso , which has strengthened 7.6
percent since 2010, has contributed to tighter  money supply , it
said.  “Renewed global financial turmoil from unsettled
conditions in Europe could adversely Mexico given its close
integration with capital markets,” the report said.  The peso declined 0.7 percent to 12.1646 per dollar at 9:46
a.m. New York time from 11.9914 on Aug. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
