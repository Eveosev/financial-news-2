South  Korea ’s stocks tumbled the most
in nearly two years and the currency had its biggest loss of
2011 after a  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. debt rating
heightened concern the global economic recovery will stall.  The  Kospi index (KOSPI)  dropped 3.8 percent to close at 1,869.45 n
Seoul, the biggest decline since November 2009. The gauge slid
14 percent in the past week, prompting the exchange to say today
that it will monitor the market more closely. The won slumped
1.5 percent to 1,083.23 per dollar, earlier touching a six-week
low of 1,084.40, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re seeing real panic-selling now,” said Im Jeong Jae,
a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $29 billion. “Concerns
about global economic conditions are affecting Asian markets
overall. Korea, which has relatively more liquidity, is feeling
a harder pinch.”  S&P lowered the U.S. sovereign rating by one level to AA+
on Aug. 5, citing the failure of the political system to rein in
the  budget deficit  and warned further downgrades may follow.
Gold rose to a record as investors favored the safest assets.  Program trading on Kospi shares was stopped for five
minutes from 1:23 p.m. local time after  Kospi 200 Index (KOSPI2)  futures
fell more than 5 percent for more than a minute, Korea Exchange
Inc. said. Trading of shares on the Kosdaq, which has 1,030
stocks, was temporarily halted after the index tumbled in excess
of 10 percent for more than a minute, triggering automatic curbs.
The tech-heavy gauge plunged 6.6 percent today, its worst
performance since November 2008.  Close Watch  The exchange operator will keep a close eye on short-
selling and arbitrage transactions,  Korea Exchange  said in an e-
mailed statement today before markets opened, after an emergency
meeting by Chairman Kim Bong Soo and other officials. The bourse
will hold a meeting every day before the market opens, the
statement said.  South Korean stocks fell more than expected as investors
overreacted to developments abroad, said Min Sung Kee, director
general of the financial markets department at the  Bank of Korea .  “It seems investors, mostly individual investors, are
responding excessively in so-called herd behavior,” Min said in
a telephone interview from Seoul today.  The Kospi has dropped 8.9 percent this year, pushing
valuations of the 780 member stocks down to 9.2 times estimated
earnings. That compares with 9.9 times for the MSCI Emerging-
Markets Index.  South Korea ’s stock market is likely to find a “bottom”
this week, according to Kim Hee Seok, head of the investment
strategy division at National Pension Service, the nation’s
biggest investor.  Bonds Gain  Overseas investors were net sellers for a fifth day,
divesting a net 77.4 billion won ($72 million) of Kospi  equities ,
according to Koscom Corp., which provides financial data from
 Korea Exchange . They have sold a net 2.55 trillion won this year.  South Korea’s government bonds were little changed, leaving
three-year yields at their lowest level since June 16. The rate
on the 3.5 percent notes due June 2014 was 3.62 percent,
according to prices from Korea Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
