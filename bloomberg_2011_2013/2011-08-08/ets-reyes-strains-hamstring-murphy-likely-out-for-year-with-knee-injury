New York Mets shortstop  Jose Reyes 
and infielder Daniel Murphy were placed on the disabled list a
day after they were injured in a loss to the  Atlanta Braves .  Reyes was diagnosed with a strained left hamstring after
leaving yesterdayâ€™s 6-5 loss in the second inning with stiffness.
He missed 12 games in July with hamstring problems.  Murphy, who left in the seventh inning, has a sprained left
knee and likely is out for the rest of the season, the team said
in a news release.  Reyes leads the National League with a .336 batting average.
Murphy was batting .320. First baseman  Ike Davis , who is
sidelined with an ankle injury, is the only other Mets player
hitting above .300 this season.  The Mets recalled infielder Ruben Tejada and outfielder
Mike Baxter from Buffalo of the International League to replace
Reyes and Murphy on the roster.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
