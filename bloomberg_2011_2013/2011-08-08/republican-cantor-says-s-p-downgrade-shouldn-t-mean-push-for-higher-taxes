U.S. House Majority Leader  Eric
Cantor  of Virginia told fellow Republicans in a memorandum today
that the Standard & Poor’s downgrading of  U.S. debt  from AAA to
AA+ will place “pressure to compromise on tax increases” as
Congress addresses its ongoing problems.  “We were not elected to raise taxes or take money out of
the pockets of hard working families and business people,”
Cantor stated in the memo, urging his party to hold Washington
“accountable” for excessive spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
