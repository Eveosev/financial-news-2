The  European Central Bank  bought more
Italian and Spanish government bonds to drive yields lower,
according to four people with knowledge of the transactions.  The ECB also bought Irish and Portuguese bonds, said two of
the people, who asked not to be identified because the deals are
confidential. A spokesman for the central bank declined to
comment.  The yield on the Italian 10-year bond slid 74 basis points
to 5.35 percent at 1:55 p.m. in London, with the Spanish yield
dropping 82 basis points to 5.24 percent.   The Irish two-year yield declined 27 basis points to 13.29
percent, while the Portuguese note yield tumbled 117 basis
points to 12.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
