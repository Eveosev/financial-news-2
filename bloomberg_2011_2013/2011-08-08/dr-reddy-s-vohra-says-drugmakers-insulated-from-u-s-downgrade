Umang Vohra, Chief Financial Officer
at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd., the nation’s second-largest
drugmaker, comments on the impact of the U.S. sovereign-rating
cut on  India  and the nation’s pharmaceutical industry.  Indian shares plunged after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the
U.S. credit rating one level to AA+ from AAA, stoking concern
that global economic growth will falter.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Healthcare Index of 18 stocks
declined as much as much as 2.5 percent.  Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. (RBXY) , the nation’s biggest drugmaker fell 0.6 percent as of
12:01 p.m. in Mumbai, and Dr. Reddy’s lost 0.7 percent.  Vohra spoke by telephone from Hyderabad in southern India.  On the impact for the company and industry:  “As a company, we don’t see a direct impact of this, as
the pharma sector is insulated from such events. We will ensure
that we are a lot more cautious in terms of how we use
capital.”  On the economy as a whole:  “I expect liquidity in the market to be tighter. There
would also be a bout of  risk aversion . People would now become
more cautious to lend. This may have a direct impact on the
various capital-intensive infrastructure projects that have been
undertaken or are being envisaged at the moment.  “I think the government would have to step in to make sure
that liquidity doesn’t dry up in the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
