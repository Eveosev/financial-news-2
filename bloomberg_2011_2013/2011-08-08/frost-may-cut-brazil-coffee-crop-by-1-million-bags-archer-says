A frost that reached some coffee-
growing regions in top producer  Brazil  last week may cut output
by almost 1 million bags next season, according to Archer
Consulting.  Temperatures fell below 2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees
Fahrenheit) in some growing areas in southern Minas Gerais
state,  Sao Paulo  and northern Parana, with possible frost
formation, Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at Somar
Meteorologia, said by phone on Aug 5.  “Some market participants are currently calculating a loss
slightly smaller than 1 million bags for next season,”  Rodrigo
Costa , a contributor to Sao Paulo-based Archer, said in a weekly
report e-mailed today. There was still no consensus on how much
production would be lost, he said.  Lower temperatures caused “some damage” to coffee crops,
with higher intensity in the growing region of Pocos de Caldas
in southern  Minas Gerais , Santos-based broker Escritorio
Carvalhaes wrote in a report dated Aug. 5. Minas Gerais is
Brazil’s largest arabica coffee-producing state.  The lack of agreement on losses from next year’s crop may
support prices along with depleted stockpiles and tight
supplies, Costa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
