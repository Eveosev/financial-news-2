Neuberger Berman  Group LLC, the New
York investment firm that bought itself out of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in 2008, said clients will probably stick with
Treasuries after the U.S. lost its top  credit rating  because the
securities are seen as an asset class of their own.  “Based on our client guidelines and an assessment of other
market participants, we do not believe there will be forced
selling of Treasury securities as a result of the downgrade,”
the company said today in a research note. “Treasuries are
generally viewed very much as an asset class.”  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. from AAA by one level to AA+
while keeping the outlook at “negative” on Aug. 5, citing the
political failure to reduce record deficits. Moody’s Investors
Service Inc. and  Fitch Ratings , which focus more on current
fiscal numbers than forward-looking analysis, are not expected
to downgrade the U.S. as well, Neuberger Berman said.  Pacific Investment Management Co., manager of the world’s
biggest mutual fund, urged some clients to loosen guidelines
that require them to hold top-rated U.S. debt at all times.
While most investors aren’t bound by requirements to hold only
AAA rated bonds, Standard & Poor’s downgrade of U.S. government
long-term debt to AA+ will affect some clients, the firm said in
a letter to customers yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
