China  sold Japan’s medium- and long-
term debt for the first time in nine months in June as the yen
traded near a record high against the dollar and benchmark
yields approached their lowest level since November.  China sold a net 508.5 billion yen ($6.5 billion) of the
fixed-income securities in June, according to a statement
released by Japan’s Ministry of Finance in  Tokyo  today. China
was a net seller of 8.4 billion yen in short-term notes maturing
in less than a year, today’s data also showed. The yen advanced
1.2 percent against the dollar in June.  “There’s a debate on whether nations should have more yen-
denominated assets, while we wonder if they will be buying given
 Japan ’s fiscal situation and low yields,” said Tetsuya Inoue,
chief researcher for financial markets in Tokyo at Nomura
Research Institute Ltd. “I think China is putting its foreign
reserves to use from a medium- and long-term standpoint.”  Japan has a public debt burden that’s twice as big as its
economy. Ten-year bonds yielded 1.005 percent in Japan, the
lowest among 32 markets tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
