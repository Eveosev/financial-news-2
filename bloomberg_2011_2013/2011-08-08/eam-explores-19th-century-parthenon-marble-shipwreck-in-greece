A team of underwater explorers in
 Greece  examined the shipwreck of the Mentor, which sunk in 1802
as it transported marbles from the Parthenon to  London .  The sculptures, part of the Parthenon collection taken and
sent to  England  by Lord Elgin, were recovered after the ship
sunk and no additional pieces were found in last monthâ€™s or in
three previous explorations, the Athens-based  Culture and
Tourism Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Three ancient coins, two silver and a bronze, were found on
the wreck as well as two pistols and navigation tools used by
the 10-member crew, according to the e-mail. French sea explorer
Jacques-Yves Cousteau investigated the vessel with a team in
1975, the ministry said.  The Mentor, which lies near the island of Kythira in the
Mediterranean sea, was explored from July 6 to July 15 and the
team was funded by Kytherian Research Group, an Australian
foundation, according to the e-mail.  Lord Elgin dismantled part of the Parthenon frieze at the
beginning of the 19th century to ship back to Britain. Greece
renewed its campaign to retrieve the marbles, housed in the
 British Museum , with the opening of the New Acropolis Museum in
June 2009.  To contact the writer on the story:
