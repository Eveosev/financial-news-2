The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options may be near its peak after rising above 40 for the first
time since May 2010, and is likely to remain elevated for weeks,
 UBS AG (UBSN)  said, citing prior surges in the gauge.  In three prior “system shocks” to levels above 30 in the
past decade, the VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index is known, remained elevated for about a month,
according to Mitchell Revsine, a New York-based equity
derivatives strategist for the largest Swiss bank. The gauge
stayed high for four to seven months when it reach that level at
the start of two recessions, Revsine said in a report today.  “If the current debt downgrade situation plays out like a
system shock scenario, then the VIX is not far from prior shock
peaks and we might expect elevated volatility for the next
several weeks,” Revsine wrote. “However, if current concerns
are a harbinger of an economic downturn, then we would not be
surprised to see higher VIX levels and market uncertainty
persist well into the fourth quarter.”  The VIX jumped 36 percent to 43.61 as of 2:17 p.m. in  New
York  after earlier rising to 43.99, the highest intraday since
May 2010, after  Standard & Poor’s  stripped the U.S. of its top
 credit rating  for the first time. The gauge of  S&P 500 Index (SPX) 
options prices has averaged 20.35 over its 21-year history.
October VIX futures rose 10 percent to 28.41.  The other five times the VIX surged were around the May 6,
2010 market crash, the 2003 Iraq invasion, the Sept. 11, 2001,
terror attacks, and the onsets of the 2008 and 2002 recessionary
periods, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
