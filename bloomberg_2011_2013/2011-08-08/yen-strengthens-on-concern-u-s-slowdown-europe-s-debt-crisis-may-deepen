the  U.S. dollar  as  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S.
credit rating and the euro-region’s debt crisis spurred investor
demand for safety.  Japan ’s currency advanced to 109.90 per euro as of 7:27
a.m. in  Tokyo  from 110.26 yesterday in  New York . The yen was at
77.57 against the dollar from 77.77.  To contact the reporter on this story:
