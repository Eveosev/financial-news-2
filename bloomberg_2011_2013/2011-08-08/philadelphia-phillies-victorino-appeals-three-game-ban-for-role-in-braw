Philadelphia Phillies outfielder
Shane Victorino has appealed a three-game suspension from  Major
League Baseball  for his role in an Aug. 5 bench-clearing
incident against the  San Francisco Giants .  Victorino can continue playing for the Phillies, who have
the best record in the majors, until the appeal process is
complete. He went 3-for-5 with two doubles, a home run and three
runs scored in last night’s 5-3 road win over the  Los Angeles
Dodgers . Victorino is hitting .310 with 12 homers and 41 runs
batted in this season.  The Phillies’ centerfielder was disciplined because his
“aggressive actions prolonged the bench-clearing incident,”
MLB said yesterday in a statement.  Victorino was hit in the back by a pitch from  San
Francisco ’s Ramon Ramirez four days ago after the Phillies’
Jimmy Rollins stole second base with a six-run lead. Victorino
began walking toward the mound, prompting players from both
teams to run onto the field. Placido Polanco of the Phillies was
tackled by Giants catcher Eli Whiteside during the fray.  Victorino, Whiteside, Polanco and Ramirez were fined
undisclosed amounts by baseball for their involvement in the
incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
