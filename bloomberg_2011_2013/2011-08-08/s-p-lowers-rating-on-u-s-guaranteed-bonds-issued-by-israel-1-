Standard & Poor’s  lowered its rating
on U.S.-guaranteed sovereign bonds issued by Israel to ‘AA+’
from ‘AAA.’  The change is in line with the rating action on the U.S.
taken on Aug. 5, the company said in a statement today. The
sovereign credit ratings on Israel remain unchanged at ‘A/A-1’,
with a stable outlook, it said.  “Since Israel hasn’t used the guarantees for quite a few
years and doesn’t intend to use them in the foreseeable future,
the change will have no significance,” said Ori Greenfeld, head
of the macroeconomics department at Psagot Investment House Ltd.  S&P on Aug. 5 cut the U.S. credit rating to AA+ from AAA,
while leaving its outlook at “negative.” About 7 percent of
 Israel ’s outstanding debt is backed by U.S. guarantees,
Greenfeld said in an Aug. 3 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
