Bearish bets against Brazilian
meatpacker  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3)  almost doubled in a week,
helping drive the stock to a record drop in the worst
performance on the benchmark Bovespa index.  Traders borrowed 15.3 million Marfrig shares as of Aug. 5,
or 4.4 percent of those outstanding, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg and  Brazil ’s clearing and depository corporation,
known as CBLC. That compares to 7.9 million shares, or 2.3
percent, on Aug. 1. Traders profit from declines by borrowing
stock and selling it in hopes of buying it later at a lower
price, also known as short selling.  Marfrig,  Latin America ’s second-largest beef producer,
plunged 25 percent to 9.02 reais in Sao Paulo at 4:15 p.m. New
York time. Traders moved 7.3 million Marfrig shares today,
almost six times the daily average of the past three months. The
stock is down 41 percent in the past five days. The Bovespa fell
8.1 percent today and is down 17 percent in the past week, the
most for any five-day period since October 2008.  “It’s possible that a big fund is getting out,” said
Sandra Peres, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage
Coinvalores. “The market is in really bad shape.”  Marfrig declined to comment on the stock moves or the
possibility that a fund is selling a stake, according to an e-
mailed statement from an outside agency representing the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
