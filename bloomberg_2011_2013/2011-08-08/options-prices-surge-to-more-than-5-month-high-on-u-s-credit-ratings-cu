Option prices in  India  reached the
highest level in more than five months as investors scrambled
for protection against further declines in stock prices after
the loss of America’s top credit rating.  The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, jumped 11.3 percent
to 27.71, the highest since Feb. 24, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The measure may reach as high as 35, according to stock
brokerage Ambit Capital Ltd.  Stocks tumbled across  Asia  and September S&P 500 futures
dropped 1.8 percent to 1,176 on concern consumer and business
confidence will deteriorate. S&P lowered the long-term credit
rating of the world’s largest economy to AA+ from AAA after U.S.
markets closed Aug. 5, citing concern that spending cuts agreed
on by lawmakers to raise the nation’s borrowing limit won’t
reduce record deficits.  “Sovereign U.S. debt rating changes will feed into the
high volatility that we are in,” Gaurav Mehta, derivatives
analyst at Ambit, said in a phone interview in Mumbai. “We
expect India VIX to spike all the way to 35, breaking out of its
1 1/2-year range.”  India VIX surged 26 percent last week, the steepest gain in
15 months.  The 50-stock Nifty Index sank 2.4 percent to 5,085.90 at
the 9:36 a.m. in Mumbai, the lowest in 14 months. The gauge has
retreated 17 percent this year amid concern higher borrowing
costs will slow growth and reduce corporate earnings.  -- Editor: Ravil Shirodkar  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
