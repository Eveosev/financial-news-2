Farid Khan, who oversees the
equivalent of $255 million in Pakistani stocks and bonds at ABL
Asset Management in Karachi, comments on the outlook for
Pakistani equities after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the U.S.
sovereign debt rating to AA+ from AAA. He spoke in a phone
interview.  On market reaction:  “I don’t think the U.S. will us affect a lot; there has
been no foreign participation in the bond and currency markets
so there no external factors affecting us. There could be a
minor adjustment in the  currency market  after the U.S.
weakened.”  On a technical correction:  “The stock market is reacting to global and regional
factors. This is not a technical correction, but is genuine
shifting/selling on the global and regional impact.”  On stocks strategy:  “Accumulation should be the strategy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
