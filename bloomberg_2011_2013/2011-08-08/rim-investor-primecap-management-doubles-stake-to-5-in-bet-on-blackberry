Primecap Management Co. doubled its
stake in  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) , making it the Blackberry
maker’s biggest outside investor in a move that may signal its
confidence the company’s shares are poised to recover.  Primecap now holds 26.4 million shares, or 5 percent of
RIM’s outstanding equity, RIM said in a regulatory statement
today. That gives it a stake of about $617 million, based on its
closing share price Aug. 5. Primecap had a stake of 2.5 percent
at the end of the second quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Primecap’s move comes as Waterloo, Ontario-based RIM tries
to recover market share lost against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and phones built
on  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android software. RIM introduced three new
phones built on a faster operating system last week as it races
to transition its whole range of phones onto a new platform next
year.  RIM’s share of worldwide smartphone sales dropped to 12
percent in the second quarter from 17 percent a year earlier,
according to Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC.
Over that time, Apple climbed to the top spot with a 19 percent
share, up from 13 percent. Samsung Electronics Co., which builds
Android phones, tripled its share to 16 percent from 5.6 percent
a year earlier, according to IDC.  RIM fell $1.52, or 6.5 percent, to $21.87 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, its lowest level since
August 2006. The stock has lost 62 percent of its value this
year. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index tumbled 6.7 percent to
1,119.51, extending its biggest slump since 2008’s bear market.  Co-chief executive officers  Jim Balsillie  and  Mike Lazaridis  are RIM’s two biggest investors with stakes of 5.9
percent and 5.4 percent respectively, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Primecap surpasses Mclean Budden Ltd. as RIM’s
third-biggest investor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
