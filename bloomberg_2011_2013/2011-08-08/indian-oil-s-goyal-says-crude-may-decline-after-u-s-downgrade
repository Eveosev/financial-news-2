P.K. Goyal, finance director at
Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s biggest refiner, expects crude
prices to decline further, following  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating.  Oil plunged in New York after the downgrade, which stoked
concern that an economic slowdown in the world’s biggest crude
consumer will worsen and cut fuel demand. S&P said on Aug. 5
that it had cut the U.S.’s AAA rating to AA+.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $3.20 to
$83.68 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and was at $84.00 at 1:32 p.m. Sydney time.  Goyal spoke by telephone from Colombo,  Sri Lanka .  On crude  oil prices :  “Sentiment is low across the world, so I think that will
result in oil prices falling further. We hope it comes down
further as this helps us reduce our costs.  ‘‘Oil needs to stabilize and we need lower prices for a
longer period for us to really benefit. We have to see what oil
does over the next month or so.  ‘‘On the whole, I am happier today than I was a couple of
weeks ago.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
