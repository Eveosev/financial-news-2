BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, moved to take its Western Australian
iron ore mining operations in house by buying a  Leighton
Holdings Ltd. (LEI)  contracting unit for $735 million.  The purchase of the HWE Mining subsidiaries that mine BHP’s
Area C, Yandi and Orebody 23/26 iron ore operations is in line
with BHP’s intention to move to owner-operator mining, the
Melbourne-based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Transitioning to owner operator in this way, rather than
by replacing contractors through direct recruitment, is a lower
risk strategy as it would be challenging to replace the highly
skilled and long serving HWE employees in the current
environment,” Ian Ashby, BHP president  iron ore , said in the e-
mail.  In  Australia , the world’s biggest exporter of iron ore,
coal and alumina, there are a record A$174 billion ($177
billion) of minerals and energy projects at an advanced stage of
development, according to government forecasts in June.  Rio Tinto Group, the second-largest mining company, last
week reported first-half profit that missed analyst estimates,
partly because of cost inflation as resources firms battle
rising wages, raw material and energy costs.  BHP expects the transaction to close during the fourth
quarter, subject to due diligence, definitive agreements and
regulatory approvals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
