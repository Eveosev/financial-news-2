Rajesh Mehta, chairman of  Rajesh
Exports Ltd. (RJEX) ,  India ’s biggest jewelry maker and exporter,
comments on gold demand after prices reached $1,700 an ounce for
the first time.  Gold for immediate delivery jumped to a record $1,715.75 an
ounce today after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the top U.S. credit
rating.  Mehta spoke in a phone interview today.  On gold prices:  “The outlook depends on international markets. Prices have
gone up too sharply. We will have to watch and see how investors
will react. International markets find gold attractive. Retail
customers may or may not like it.”  On the U.S. rating downgrade:  “The U.S. rating downgrade doesn’t mean too much for our
business. We have a share of the U.S. market as far as exports
are concerned, but our customers are jewelers rather than retail
customers. There would be pressure on India. India is affected
by the turmoil in international markets, but should see it as an
opportunity.”  On gold demand in India:  “The gold demand is not bad, nor is it good. The demand
has been moderate in the previous month. The higher prices are
hurting Indian demand. Customers will take time to adjust to
 price levels .  ‘‘There is not too much scrap sales. People will wait for
some time before scrap sales start.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
