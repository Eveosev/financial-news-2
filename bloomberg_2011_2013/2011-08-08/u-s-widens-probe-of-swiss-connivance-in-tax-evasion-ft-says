U.S. prosecutors looking at whether
Swiss bankers helped rich American to evade tax have widened
their inquiries to include at least six more Swiss banks and one
Liechtenstein private bank, the Financial Times reported, citing
court documents.  While none of the additional banks is identified, the
documents indicate that they may have opened secret offshore
accounts for clients of UBS AG after the latter terminated the
business at the behest of U.S. authorities after 2008, the
newspaper said.  The information comes from indictments of a Zurich
accountant who allegedly created sham offshore foundations and
companies, and of two former UBS bankers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
