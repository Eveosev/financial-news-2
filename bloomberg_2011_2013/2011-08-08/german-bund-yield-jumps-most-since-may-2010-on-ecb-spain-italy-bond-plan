German  government bonds  slid, pushing
the yield on 10-year bunds up the most in almost 15 months,
after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled he’s ready to start buying Italian and Spanish debt.  Two-year notes snapped a run of eight straight advances.
The Frankfurt-based central bank welcomed Italy’s and  Spain ’s
efforts to reduce their budget deficits and said it will
“actively implement” its bond-purchase program, according to a
statement issued in the name of the ECB president yesterday.
Bunds rose last week as concern escalated that slowing global
growth will make it more difficult for  Europe ’s most indebted
nations to finance their obligations.  Ten-year bund yields rose as much as 17 basis points, the
biggest increase since May 10, 2010, and were 13 basis points
higher at 2.48 percent as of 7:51 a.m. in  London . The 3.25
percent security maturing in July 2021 fell 1.185, or 11.85
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,434) face amount, to 106.715. Yields on
two-year notes increased nine basis points to 0.86 percent.  The Sentix measure of euro-area investor confidence will
probably drop to 3.4 for August from 5.3 in July, according to
the median of six economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey
before the report is published today.  German government bonds handed investors 4.5 percent this
year, compared with 5.4 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have returned 0.1
percent, while Italian debt earned a 4.4 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
