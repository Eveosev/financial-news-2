Gasoline prices in  Kenya  may increase
by 2.3 shillings ($0.02) per liter this month after
international oil prices increased and the shilling weakened
against the dollar, KenolKobil Ltd. said.  Kenyan fuel costs have jumped more than 20 percent since
December when the country re-introduced price controls. The
latest increase on July 14 took gasoline to 115.46 shillings a
liter.  The Energy Regulatory Commission is scheduled to announce
fuel prices for August later this week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
