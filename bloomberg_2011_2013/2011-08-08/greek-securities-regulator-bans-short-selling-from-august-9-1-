Greece ’s securities regulator banned
short selling on the Athens exchange for a period of two months
starting tomorrow, citing market conditions.  “Extraordinary market conditions prevailing in Greece”
led the board to ban all short selling starting tomorrow,
according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based
Hellenic Capital Markets Commission today. The regulator had
partially lifted a 2010 ban on short selling from Sept. 1,
allowing covered short selling of stocks.  The ASE Index closed 6 percent down today, the biggest
decline in more than a year, closing at 998.24, the lowest level
since January 1997, according to Bloomberg data.  National Bank
of Greece SA (ETE) , the country’s biggest lender, fell 4 percent to
4.06 euros.  Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO)  dropped
11 percent to 4.19 euros, its biggest one-day fall since June
last year.  Investors continued to flee equities today after  Standard &
Poor’s  downgraded the sovereign-debt rating for the U.S. by one
level to AA+ on Aug. 5 and maintained its “negative” outlook.
Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed their AAA
credit ratings for the world’s largest economy on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
