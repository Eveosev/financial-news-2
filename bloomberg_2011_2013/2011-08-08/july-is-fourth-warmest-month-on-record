July went into the record books as
the fourth-warmest month in U.S. history as temperature marks
fell across the country, the  National Climate Data Center  said.  The average daily high temperature in July was 77 degrees
Fahrenheit (25 Celsius), 2.7 degrees warmer than the 1901-2000
norm, according to the center in Asheville,  North Carolina .
 Oklahoma  and Texas had their warmest months ever.  “Only seven of the lower 48 states -- all west of the
Rockies -- experienced a July average temperature near or below
the 20th century average,” according to the report released
today. “The other 41 had an above-normal, much-above-normal or
record warmest July.”  From May to July, a persistent weather pattern set up
across the country bringing cool air to the western third of the
U.S. and heat to the eastern half, the center said. Oklahoma had
its warmest May-to-July period and 18 other states recorded the
90-day periods that were in their Top 10 for heat.  Washington , D.C., also had its warmest month, with an
average temperature of 84.5 degrees, breaking the previous mark
of 83.1 set in July 2010 and July 1993.  The region made up of  Texas , Arkansas, Mississippi,
Oklahoma,  Kansas  and  Louisiana  had an average temperature of
86.1 degrees, the warmest since 1895, when records were first
kept. The previous mark was 85.9 in 1980.  Southern Heat  Oklahoma City’s monthly average temperature of 89.2 degrees
broke the record set in August 1936, which had an average
temperature of 88.7, the center said.  Oklahoma averaged 88.9, “the warmest monthly statewide
average temperature on record for any state during any month,”
the report said. The previous record, also set in Oklahoma, was
88.1 in July 1954.  Dallas exceeded 100 degrees for 30 of 31 days in July as
Texas set a record with a monthly average of 87.1.  Dallas  has
posted 37 days in a row above 100 degrees, five days behind the
record of 42 in 1980, according to the  National Weather Service .
At 1 p.m. local time today, the temperature in Dallas was 99.  The same pattern that brought the heat also meant more rain
in the northern Plains while extending a drought across Texas
and the U.S. South.  “Drought conditions are so harsh in some locations that it
would take as much as 20 inches of precipitation in one month to
end the drought,” the center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
