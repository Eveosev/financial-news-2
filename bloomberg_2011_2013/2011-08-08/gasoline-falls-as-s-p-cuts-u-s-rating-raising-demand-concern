Gasoline fell for the eighth time in
nine days as the  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of America’s debt
spurred concern that the economic recovery is faltering.  Futures lost as much as 3 percent as commodities sank after
S&P lowered the U.S. long-term rating one level to AA+ after
markets closed on Aug. 5. The S&P’s GSCI index of 24 raw
materials including oil and petroleum products declined 2.5
percent at 10:41 a.m. in New York.  “The market anticipates slower economic growth, higher
 interest rates  and slowing growth in demand,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for September delivery declined 6.08 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $2.7444 a gallon at 11 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.7223. Today’s loss for
gasoline follows a 9.9 percent decline last week.  Prices are down 21 percent since settling at $3.4648 on
April 29, the highest closing price this year.  “The downgrade seems to have triggered another avalanche
of worry,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “It just shows lots
of things were predicted on the expectation that everything was
going to get better.”  September-delivery crude fell 3.6 percent to $83.68 a
barrel and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index sank 3.3 percent as
of 11:05 a.m.  Stronger Dollar  The dollar gained 1 percent against the euro, reducing the
investment appeal of commodities, as the European sovereign debt
crisis deepened. The  European Central Bank  is buying Italian and
Spanish bonds to try and tame the region’s credit emergency.  “Trading is all about the European sovereign debt crisis
and the S&P downgrade, even though the downgrade is hogwash
because the U.S. has the ability to meet its obligations,” said
Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management
Institute in  New York .  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1
cent to $3.663 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices
have dropped every day but one since July 29.  Heating oil for September delivery fell 7.66 cents, or 2.6
percent, to $2.8651 a gallon on the exchange. The front-month
contract fell 5 percent last week, the largest decline in six
weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
