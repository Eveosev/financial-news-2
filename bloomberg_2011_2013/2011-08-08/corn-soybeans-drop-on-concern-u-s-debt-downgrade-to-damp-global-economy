Corn declined the most in a week and
soybeans fell for the fourth straight session after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating, boosting concern that demand
for food,  animal feed  and fuel made from the crops will ebb.  Crude oil fell to an eight-month low, and equities plunged
on concern that global economic growth will slow. The Group of
20 leaders said they are ready to stabilize financial markets
after S&P lowered the U.S. rating on Aug. 5. The S&P GSCI index
of 24 raw materials dropped as much as 4.5 percent. Gold surged
the most since March 2009 to a record.  “Traders are dumping grain positions and will move to the
sidelines to sort out the impact on the economy from the credit
downgrade,” Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Demand is slowing, and that offsets the outlook for
smaller U.S. crops” from hot, dry Midwest weather in July, Grow
said.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 17 cents, or 2.4
percent, to close at $6.86 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the largest decline since July 29. The grain has
jumped 63 percent in the past year amid declining global
inventories.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 24.5 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $13.115 a bushel, the lowest settlement since
June 30. The price has dropped 4.9 percent since Aug. 2.  The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of corn and
soybeans. Corn is the nation’s biggest crop, valued at $66.7
billion in 2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion,
government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
