Bonds issued by the euro area’s most
indebted nations are poised to rally relative to benchmark
German bunds after the  European Central Bank  signaled its
readiness to buy Spanish and Italian debt, Commerzbank AG said.  “This bold step is needed to convince markets about the
ECB’s resolve,”  Christoph Rieger , head of fixed-income strategy
in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We therefore
expect spreads to come in significantly” and benchmark German
bunds “should be under pressure.”  Still, “large volumes” may be needed to convince markets
that the ECB “is willing to stop the bleeding whatever it
takes,” Rieger wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
