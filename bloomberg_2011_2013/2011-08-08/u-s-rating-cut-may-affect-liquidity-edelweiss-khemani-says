Vikas Khemani, president and head of
institutional equities at Mumbai-based Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
comments on the outlook for Indian stocks after  Standard &
Poor’s  downgraded U.S.’s AAA credit rating one level to AA+
while keeping the outlook at “negative.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index tumbled 4.9
percent last week, the most since October 2009, to 17,305.87,
amid concerns the world economy may slip into recession.
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 1.5 percent at 11:20 a.m.
in  Tokyo .  “Markets will trade choppy, nervous and volatile on
account of the downgrade. It’s a global macro development that
can curb liquidity and heighten risk aversion across the world.  ‘‘We expect markets to open gap down and recover during the
day. Investors were expecting an U.S. downgrade to happen.  ‘‘Investors will wait to gauge the real impact of the
downgrade and how it pans out in the long term. We will have to
see how governments throughout the world respond to this event.
We believe governments will not let this become a major crisis.
Therefore, it may not be a global catastrophe like in 2008.’’  ‘‘Borrowing cost for Indian companies will also go up with
higher  risk aversion . Indian IT companies will also get
affected.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
