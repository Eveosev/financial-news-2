Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s third
worst-performing currency this year, declined for a third day
against the dollar as oil importers bought the U.S. currency and
inflation accelerated to an 18-year high.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.9 percent to 2,695 per dollar at 5:06 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala. It closed at 2,670 on Aug. 5.  “The weakening of the shilling was due to increased demand
of the dollar especially by the energy sector,” Ahmed Kalule, a
currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd. said by phone from
Kampala. The shilling may get support from a scheduled 95
billion shilling auction of Treasury bills on Aug. 10, he said.  A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to a more
than 18-year high of 18.7 percent last month from 15.7 percent
in June, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  The shilling has slumped 14 percent this year, the steepest
decline after the Maldives rufiyaa and Suriname dollar, which
fell 16.7 percent and 16.8 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
