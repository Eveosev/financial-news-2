The pound declined versus the euro
and the yen as a report showed Britonsâ€™ confidence in the
outlook for employment and their  job security  weakened in July.  The British currency gained for a second day against the
dollar. An index of sentiment toward their employment prospects
compared with a year earlier dropped 3 points to minus 53 from
June, while a gauge of job security declined 1 point to
minus 22, the unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in an e-
mailed statement released in  London  today. The FTSE 100 Index
fell 0.3 percent.  The pound was 0.4 percent weaker at 87.45 pence per euro as
of 8:16 a.m. in London. It reached 86.43 pence on Aug. 5, the
strongest since May 27. Sterling gained 0.4 percent to $1.6452
and fell 0.4 percent to 127.96 yen.  Sterling has fallen 7.1 percent in the last 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
