A drought in  Kenya  killed livestock
worth 64.2 billion shillings ($690 million), including 3.5
million head of Zebu cattle, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing
Livestock Development Permanent Secretary Kenneth Lusaka.  A further 2.7 million goats and 2.5 million sheep have died
as a result of the lack of rain, the Nairobi-based newspaper
said. The Livestock Development Ministry needs 2 billion
shillings to avert a “catastrophe” in the agriculture
industry, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
