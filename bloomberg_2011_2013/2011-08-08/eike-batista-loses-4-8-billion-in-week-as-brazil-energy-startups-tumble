Eike Batista , the richest man in
 Brazil , has lost about $5.8 billion in the past week after his
energy and mining startups plunged amid the worst rout in the
nation’s equity market since the 2008 financial crisis.  The value of his stock holdings has fallen 26 percent since
Aug. 1 to 26.6 billion reais ($16.5 billion), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and EBX Group Ltd., the holding company
for most of his assets. Oil driller OGX Petroleo & Gas
Participacoes SA, which has yet to produce any crude, and miner
MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA are the second- and third-worst
performers on the 66-member Bovespa index in the past five days,
falling 28 percent and 27 percent, respectively.  “These are the stocks that tend to suffer the most when
people get uncertain regarding the global economy,” said Eric Conrads, who helps manage about $1.2 billion in Latin American
stocks at ING Investment Management in  New York . “When you
don’t have any earnings, what can you expect? People lose
patience at some stage.”  Batista, the world’s eighth-richest person according to
Forbes magazine, rejected the idea that he has lost money. “I
didn’t sell anything, consequently I didn’t lose anything!” the
billionaire said in an Aug. 5 post on his  Twitter  account. He
has said that the “X” in his companies’ names symbolizes the
multiplication of wealth.  EBX said in an e-mailed statement that the plunge in value
followed global markets and that its companies have $10 billion
in cash, enough to finance their investment plans.  MMX, OGX  MMX lost 9.7 percent to 5.96 reais in  Sao Paulo  at 4:15
p.m. New York time, while OGX tumbled 16 percent to 9.20 reais.
 OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the pre-operational shipbuilder whose future
revenue depends on orders from the oil and gas explorer, slid 12
percent to 290 reais and is down 25 percent since Aug. 1, the
fifth-largest slide on the 73-member  BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV) 
index.  The benchmark Bovespa index fell 8.1 percent today and is
down 17 percent in the past week, the most for any five-day
period since October 2008.  OSX is trading 64 percent below its March 2010 initial
public offering price of 800 reais, the worst performer among 22
Brazilian IPOs since the beginning of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
