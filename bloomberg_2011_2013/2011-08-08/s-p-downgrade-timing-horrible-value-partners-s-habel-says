Fawaz Habel, a Hong Kong-based senior
fund manager at  Value Partners Group Ltd. (806) , which oversees $8.9
billion of assets, comments on the impact of the  Standard &
Poor’s  downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Habel runs the $62
million Value Partners Credit Fund.  S&P on Aug. 5 lowered U.S.’s long-term sovereign credit
rating one level to AA+ from AAA, keeping the outlook at
“negative,” citing the political failure to reduce record
deficits. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings affirmed
their AAA credit ratings for the U.S. on Aug. 2.  “I think fears over U.S. growth and European Monetary
Union are driving markets and not much the U.S. downgrade. It
was telegraphed well in advance and has no impact on money
markets funds and repo since the short-term rating is unchanged.
S&P’s timing is horrible and it is adding to global concerns.”  “For us, we have been focused on short-term debt for some
time and we continue to add risk we consider cheap while
shorting expensive bonds.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
