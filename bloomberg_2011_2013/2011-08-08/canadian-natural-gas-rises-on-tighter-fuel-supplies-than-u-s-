Canadian natural gas rose as tighter
supplies in  Alberta  than in the U.S. contended with a day that
saw most commodities fall.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gained 0.9
percent as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
reported temperatures in much of the U.S. South would be above-
normal until Aug. 17.  “The stocks there are quite a bit tighter,” Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist at INTL FCStone Inc. in
 St. Louis Park ,  Minnesota , said in a telephone interview. “When
you look at the U.S. stocks that have been average, the Canadian
ones have been on the lower end for the last three years.”  Alberta gas for September delivery gained 3 cents to C$3.34
per gigajoule ($3.19 per million British thermal units) as of
3:20 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian Internet
market. October gas rose 3.25 cents to C$3.36. Gas traded on the
exchange goes to users in Canada and the U.S. and is priced on
 TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  In New York, natural gas for September delivery fell 0.6
cent to settle at $3.935 per million Btu.  The high in Dallas today may reach 103 degrees (39
Celsius), 6 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State
College , Pennsylvania.  Power plants  use 30 percent of U.S. gas supplies, according
to the Energy Department.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 2 p. m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.69 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.83 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.58 billion cubic feet today, about 61 percent of its
capacity of 2.58 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 3.07 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.16 per million Btu as of
1:40 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas dropped 3.69 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.7382, the
