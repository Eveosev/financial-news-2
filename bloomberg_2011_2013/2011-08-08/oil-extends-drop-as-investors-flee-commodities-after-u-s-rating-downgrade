Oil fell to the lowest in more than
10 months in  New York  and dipped below $100 a barrel in  London 
as the U.S. credit-rating cut and rising stockpiles stoked
concern a slowing economy will reduce demand for fuel.  Crude declined as Asian stocks dropped for a sixth day.
U.S. equities slumped the most since December 2008 in the first
trading session since Standard & Poor’s Aug. 5 downgrade. An
Energy Department report tomorrow may show crude inventories
climbed for a third week. Brent oil traded in London slipped
below $100 for the first time since Feb. 8.  “Until we can see some confidence coming back to the U.S.
consumer, the situation is probably not going to change that
much in terms of another strong price rally,” said  David Lennox , a resource analyst at Fat Prophets in Sydney, who kept
his forecast for New York crude to average $115 this year. “A
recession would obviously have the potential to reduce
consumption and that will place pressure on prices.”  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $5.60, or 6.9
percent, to $75.71 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest price since Sept. 29. It
was at $79.71 at 8:49 a.m. London time. Prices have fallen 2.1
percent in the past year.  Brent oil for September settlement was down 88 cents at
$102.86 a barrel after slipping as much as $5, or 4.8 percent,
to $98.74 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a $23.09 premium to U.S.
futures, after earlier reaching an intraday record of $23.76.  Increased Volatility  New York futures have tumbled 30 percent since reaching a
two-year high of $114.83 in intraday trading on May 2. Implied
volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was at 61.57 percent at 8 a.m. London time, up
from 40.9 percent Aug. 5.  Federal Reserve policy makers will hold a one-day meeting
today as the removal of the top  credit rating  for the U.S.
stokes speculation the nation is headed for a recession. S&P
said it downgraded the country one level to AA+ because the
agreement by President  Barack Obama  and congressional
Republicans didn’t do enough to stabilize the government’s
“medium-term debt dynamics.”  “The way prices are falling, especially on  stock
exchanges , they are likely to keep falling until the Fed unveils
some new program,”  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron Hanover
Inc., an energy adviser in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut , said in an
e-mailed note. “There are very few options available, but this
is threatening to be a complete meltdown.”  Equities Slump  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 1.4 percent at 3:52
p.m. in  Tokyo , paring losses of as much as 5.5 percent. Euro
Stoxx 50 futures slid 0.7 percent. S&P 500 Index futures rose
1.1 percent, following a 6.7 percent plunge in the gauge
yesterday. The Standard & Poor’s Index fell 6.7 percent to
1,119.46 at the 4 p.m. close in New York, its lowest since
September, as all 500 stocks fell for the first time since
Bloomberg began tracking the data in 1996.  China ’s inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in there
years in July, restraining the government from easing monetary
policy as risks to the global economy mount. Consumer prices
climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier, the Beijing-based
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website today.  The Energy Department report tomorrow may show crude oil
supplies increased 1.5 million barrels in the seven days ended
Aug. 5 as the government released barrels from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, according to the median of eight analyst
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline inventories
probably climbed 900,000 barrels, the survey shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
