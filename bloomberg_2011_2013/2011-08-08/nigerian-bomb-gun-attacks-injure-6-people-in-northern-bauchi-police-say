Bomb and gun attacks in  Nigeria ’s
northern city of Bauchi by suspected Islamic militants injured
six people, Muhammed Barau, a police spokesman in the region,
said today by phone.  A bomb, which exploded before dawn today in the city as a
police patrol vehile drove by, injured four policemen, Barau
said. Hours earlier, gunmen had opened fire on another patrol,
injuring a policeman and a passing civilian, he said, blaming
the incidents on the Boko Haram sect.  Nigerian authorities have blamed the sect, which draws
inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban movement, for an upsurge
in violent attacks in the mainly Muslim north in the past two
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
