Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased less of the fuel last
month after an accident at Formosa Plastics Group reduced
processing capacity.  Shipments declined 27 percent from a year earlier to 27.2
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s July oil bill climbed 10 percent to
$3.02 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Plastics Group, the island’s biggest diversified
industrial company, halted some plants in its Mailiao complex
after a fire on May 12, according to statements from its units.
Its refining unit Formosa Petrochemical Corp. has shut its No. 1
naphtha cracker. The plant processes naphtha, distilled from
crude oil, to ethylene for production of plastics and chemicals.  Output by Taiwan’s petroleum and coal product industries
fell 14 percent in June from a year earlier, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said July 25.  Formosa Petrochemical said it had halted its Mailiao
refinery after another blaze July 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
