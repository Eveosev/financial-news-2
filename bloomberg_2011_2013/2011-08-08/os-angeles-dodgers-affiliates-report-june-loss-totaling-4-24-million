The  Los Angeles Dodgers  baseball team
and bankrupt affiliates posted net losses totaling $4.24 million
in June on revenue of $38.5 million.  The holding company that owns the team and its affiliates
spent about $39.4 million during the month, resulting in an
operating loss of about $940,000, according to documents filed
Aug. 5 in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington, Delaware.
Expenses included $20.8 million on “baseball operations” and
$2.9 million on interest.  The team collected about $13.2 million in ticket sales,
$8.6 million from broadcasting and $5.6 million from advertising
and sponsorship, court papers show. The consolidated balance
sheet listed $370.6 million in assets and $643.9 million in debt
as of June 30.  The Dodgers agreed Aug. 5 to borrow as much as $150 million
from Major League Baseball to help fund operation while in
bankruptcy. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross denied the team
approval of its preferred bankruptcy loan from  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM) ’s Highbridge Capital Management LLC, saying MLB’s was
superior. MLB’s offer didn’t require collateral and had a lower
 interest rate  and fees than the Highbridge loan, Gross found.  The case is In re Los Angeles Dodgers LLC, 11-12010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
