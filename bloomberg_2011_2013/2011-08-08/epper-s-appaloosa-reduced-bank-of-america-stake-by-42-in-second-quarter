David Tepper , the founder of hedge
fund Appaloosa Management LP, cut his stake in  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  by 42 percent in the second quarter, before the stock fell
today to a two-year low, according to a regulatory filing.  Appaloosa held 10 million shares of the  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based bank as of June 30, compared with 17.2 million at
the end of the first quarter, a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission showed. The bank declined 18
percent in the second quarter.  Bank of America fell to its lowest level since April 2009
in New York trading after American International Group Inc.
disclosed plans to sue the company over faulty mortgages and
analysts speculated about a capital-raising effort.  The bank slid $1.52, or 19 percent, to $6.65 as of 2:30
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after falling
as much as 23 percent. It was the biggest drop since April 2009,
and left the stock with a loss of about half its value since the
start of this year.  A telephone message left for Tepper, whose firm is based in
Chatham,  New Jersey , wasn’t immediately returned.  Bank of America was Tepper’s fourth-largest U.S. stock
holding in the first quarter. It was his second-largest position
decrease in the second quarter, after Hewlett-Packard Co.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
