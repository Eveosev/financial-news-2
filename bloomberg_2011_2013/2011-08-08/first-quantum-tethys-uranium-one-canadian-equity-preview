Canadian stocks rallied the most
since May 2009 after the U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to keep
its  interest rate  at a record low and said it was prepared to
use a range of policy tools to boost the economy.  Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s largest lender by
assets, advanced 3.6 percent.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,
Canada’s second-biggest energy company by market value,
increased 5.3 percent.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) , which produces base
metals in  Europe , surged 15 percent after the Daily Telegraph
reported rumors that BHP Billiton Ltd. and Nyrstar NV may bid
for the company.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index climbed 438.30
points, or 3.8 percent, to 12,109.26 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, its
biggest gain since May 2009.  “You could get a meaningful bottom this time that will
recover over the next three or four years, and that will be
healthy,” Danielle Park, a partner at Venable Park Investment
Counsel Inc. in Barrie, Ontario, said in a telephone interview.
Venable manages at least C$1 million ($1.01 million) each for
more than 250 families,  The stock benchmark sank 8.9 percent, the most since
December 2008, to an 11-month low in the three days ending
yesterday as S&P cut its credit rating on the U.S. for the first
time. The index plunged 18 percent from the post-2008 high
reached on April 5 as economic data indicated a slowing recovery
in the U.S. and Canada.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Reserve  pledged to keep its interest rate at a
record low at least through mid-2013 after the unprecedented
downgrade of the U.S.’s top credit rating by S&P shook investor
confidence in America’s economic recovery. Before the meeting in
Washington, there was speculation that Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
would announce such steps as a third round of emergency stimulus
measures, or QE3, to pump up growth.  “Today’s reaction will be to take some of the earlier
gains in equities off the table, but we really don’t think the
Fed could have done more at this point, ahead of further
insights into how the economy is actually faring in the second
half,” Avery Shenfeld, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
chief economist, wrote in a note today.  The market erased earlier gains after the statement, then
rallied to the biggest advance in more than two years and
biggest one-day swing in points since November 2008.  “I think this whole sell off is more physiological than
real. It’s all about things that could happen,”  David
Cockfield , senior vice president and managing director at
Northland Wealth Management in Toronto, which oversees C$200
million ($208 million) said in a telephone interview.  Precious Metal  Gold rose to another record, settling at $1,743 an ounce.
 OceanaGold Corp. (OGC) , which explores in New Zealand and the
Philippines, rallied 11 percent to C$2.07 while other gold
stocks shifted between gains and losses.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the
world’s largest gold producer, increased 2 percent to C$46.84.
 Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-largest producer of the metal
by market value, rose 2 percent to C$47.24.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, advanced 9.6 percent to C$41.43.  First Quantum
Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s second-largest publicly traded copper
producer, climbed 8.2 percent to C$22.43.  Deal Rumors  Lundin Mining gained 15 percent, the most since Feb. 28, to
C$5.05. The base-metals producer with operations in Europe is
the subject of rumors that BHP Billiton and Nyrstar may bid for
the company, the Daily Telegraph reported, citing unnamed
traders. John Miniotis, a senior business analyst and spokesman
for Lundin, declined to comment on “market speculation.”  Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. jumped 12 percent to
C$7.8. The molybdenum producer posted second-quarter results
that exceeded estimates, saying earnings minus some items were
33 cents a share, beating the average analyst estimate of 25
cents a share, according to Bloomberg data.  Uranium One Inc. (UUU) , a mining company controlled by Moscow-
based ARMZ Uranium Holding, rallied 9.8 percent to C$3.02 after
it reported second-quarter earnings minus some items of 3 cents
a share, meeting the average analyst estimate. Lower-than-
anticipated sales were offset by low cash costs, Bank of
Montreal analyst Edward Sterck said in a note dated today.  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the world’s largest uranium producer, fell
3.4 percent to C$21.64 as uranium spot prices fell 1.4 percent
after the global market slump weakened the already ailing demand
for nuclear fuel, Ux Consulting Co. said.  Oil, Corn  Crude oil declined after rising earlier in the day
following a 10-month low. ARC Resources Ltd., which produces oil
and gas in western  Canada , jumped 9.3 percent to C$22.99 after
gaining 12 percent, the most since December 2008. Canadian
Natural Resources increased 5.3 percent, the most since June
2009, to C$34.80.  Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s
largest fertilizer producer by market value, rose 4.9 percent to
C$51.49. Corn futures rose after the U.S. said crop conditions
deteriorated for the third time in four weeks following a July
heat wave, signaling tightening supplies in 2012.  Chinese tree-farm operator  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  climbed 26
percent to C$6.83.  Magna International Inc. (MG) , Canada’s biggest
auto-parts maker, rose 9.6 percent to C$38.35, its biggest gain
since May 2010.  The S&P/TSX financial stock index gained 4.1 percent, the
most since May 2009.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  increased 3.6 percent
to C$50.24.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  rose 4.7 percent, the most
since May 2009, to C$75.02.  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  advanced 5.7
percent, the most since March 2009, to C$52.78.  Out of the 10 indexes in the S&P/TSX, nine gained at least
3 percent, for the first time since October 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
