Most state and local governments
facing the loss of buyers-of-last-resort for variable-rate debt
found new ones or resolved the issue in this year’s first half,
Moody’s Investors Service said, citing issuers it rates.  Among borrowers with expiring letters of credit or
liquidity facilities, 78 percent got extensions from their banks
or found new lenders this year through June, Moody’s said today
in a report. Most of the rest refinanced their variable-rate
debt through new bonds, private placements or bank loans.  “The orderly resolution of bank-facility expirations
during the first two quarters is encouraging” since so many are
ending this year, said Thomas Jacobs, a Moody’s vice president
and a co-author of the report.  With $130 billion of the credit facilities expiring in
2011, the $40 billion that ended in the second quarter was a
test, Jacobs said in the report. Borrowers unable to replace
credit facilities or refund their debt can face “severe and
rapid credit deterioration,” according to the report.  Banks of last resort agree to buy back variable-rate debt
from investors who want to sell. When issuers lose this support,
the bank generally repurchases all the bonds and requires
accelerated repayment, sometimes at penalty rate.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  made up 57 percent of the market for providers replacing
or extending the agreements, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
