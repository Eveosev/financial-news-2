The Turkish government plans
constitutional changes to bring the military under civilian
control, the Financial Times reported, citing Omer Celik, an
adviser to Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  and the deputy
chairman of the ruling  Justice and Development Party .  Erdogan’s government, which purged the high command of the
armed forces a few days ago, will limit the forces’ financial
and judicial autonomy and begin to transform the army from a
conscript to a professional force, the newspaper said.  Changes in the constitution will be initiated when
parliament reconvenes in October; a charter imposed by the
military after a coup d’etat in 1980, one of four that took
place between 1960 and 1997, will be replaced, the FT said.  The authority of military courts will be curbed and
officers brought under civilian jurisdiction for all but
internal discipline, the newspaper said.  Since 1923, when the republic was founded by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,  Turkey ’s generals have regarded themselves as the
guardians of the constitution, with the right to make or break
governments, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
