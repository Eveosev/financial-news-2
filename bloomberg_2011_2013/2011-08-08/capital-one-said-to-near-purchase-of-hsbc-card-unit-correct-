Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that agreed to buy ING Direct USA in June, is in advanced
talks to purchase  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s credit-card portfolio,
according to a person familiar with the discussions.  A deal between Capital One, based in McLean, Virginia, and
HSBC may be announced soon, according to the person who declined
to be identified because the discussions are private. HSBC’s
portfolio held as much as $33 billion in loans, according to a
company  presentation  in May.  The transaction would be the second for Capital One in as
many months after the lender agreed in June to purchase ING
Groep NV’s U.S. online bank for $9 billion. The ING purchase,
which Capital One said will be completed by late this year or
early 2012, will add about $80 billion in deposits and 7 million
customers.  Robert Sherman, an HSBC spokesman, and Tatiana Stead, a
Capital One spokeswoman, said they couldn’t comment on the HSBC
transaction.  The negotiations were reported earlier today by
MarketWatch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
