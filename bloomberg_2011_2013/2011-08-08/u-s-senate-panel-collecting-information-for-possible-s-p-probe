     Aug. 8 (Bloomberg)-- The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is
looking into the decision by  Standard & Poor’s  to downgrade the
nation’s credit rating for the first time in history, according
a committee aide briefed on the matter.  Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, a South
Dakota Democrat, is gathering more information on the Aug. 5
decision, which has been criticized by Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  and other officials in President Barack Obama’s administration, according to the aide, who declined to
be identified because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter
publicly.  “This irresponsible move by S&P may, however, have
spillover effects that tax the American people by increasing
interest rates on home loans, credit cards, and  car loans , and
by increasing the cost of finance for some state and local
governments,” Johnson said in a statement today. “I am deeply
disappointed in S&P’s decision to enter into the game of
political punditry.”  Lawmakers left  Washington  last week for their summer
recess; Congress is expected to resume work in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
