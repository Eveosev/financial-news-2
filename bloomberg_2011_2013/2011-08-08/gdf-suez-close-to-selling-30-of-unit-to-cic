GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA is close to a deal to
sell about 30 percent of its exploration and production business
for as much as 3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to  China 
Investment Corp., said a person familiar with the negotiations.  The deal, which is part of a broader joint venture, could
be announced as soon as this week, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the matter is private. A transaction
may still fail to occur.  GDF Suez, the operator of Europe’s largest natural-gas
distribution grid, is looking to team up with Chinese companies
on ventures tied to water, power and energy efficiency. The
former French gas monopoly, led by Gerard Mestrallet, plans to
sell 10 billion euros of assets through 2013 to help pare debt.  Les Echos  reported the talks earlier. Spokesmen for CIC,
China’s sovereign wealth fund, and Paris-based GDF Suez declined
to comment.  GDF Suez is scheduled to announce earnings this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
