China ’s American depositary receipts
traded in the U.S. fell for the fifth day, with a benchmark
index headed toward its biggest five-day decline since January
2009, after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. debt rating.  The Bank of  New York  Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks
American depositary receipts, fell 4.3 percent to 385.80 at
12:23 p.m. New York time. The gauge has tumbled 13 percent since
Aug. 1 to the lowest level since September.  Equities slumped globally after Standard & Poor’s lowered
the U.S. credit rating by one level to AA+ for the first time on
Aug. 5 on concern about the nation’s ability to reduce record
deficits. The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  dropped 3.7 percent to the
lowest since October and the Shanghai Composite Index, which
measures the bigger of China’s stock exchanges, slumped 3.8
percent to the lowest in more than one year.  “There are a lot of Chinese companies that investors are
leaving,” said Kevin Pollack, a  fund manager  at New York-based
Paragon Capital LP who invests in U.S.-listed Chinese stocks.
“The risk-reward for those today isn’t as attractive as other
opportunities temporarily while this market is in this volatile
situation as the result of the debt issue in the U.S. and the
recent downgrade.”  Baidu Inc., owner of China’s most popular online search
engine, dropped 5.6 percent in New York to $133.13. It has slid
for five days in a row and has lost 19 percent from this year’s
high of $164.36 reached July 26. Jiangxi Copper Co., the
nation’s biggest copper producer, plunged 8.5 percent, the most
since May 2010, as copper for September delivery dropped for the
sixth day on the Comex in New York.  PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil producer, sank as
much as 4.4 percent to the lowest intraday price since the end
of December after oil futures fell to the lowest price in more
than eight months.  Sina Corp., which owns the Twitter-like Weibo service in
China, retreated 4.5 percent.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , operator of China’s
fifth-most visited website, 5.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
