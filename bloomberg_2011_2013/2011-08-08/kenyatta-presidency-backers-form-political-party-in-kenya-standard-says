Kenyan lawmakers who back Finance
Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  to run for president in the next
election formed a new political party called the United
Democratic Front, the Standard reported.  Kenyatta’s candidacy was endorsed on Aug. 6 by 26
lawmakers, including Energy Minister Kiraitu Murungi and Ephraim
Maina, lawmaker for the Mthira constituency, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing a statement by the group.  Kenyatta is currently chairman of the Kenya African
National Union, some of whom’s members have demanded that he
resign for associating with another party, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
