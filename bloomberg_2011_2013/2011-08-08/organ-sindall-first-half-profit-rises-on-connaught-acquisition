Morgan Sindall Group Plc (MGNS) , a U.K.
construction and refurbishment company, said first-half profit
climbed 14 percent as affordable housing revenue was boosted by
an acquisition and it reduced its share of public-sector work.  Net income rose to 14.9 million pounds ($24.5 million),
from 13.1 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue advanced 11 percent
to 1.09 billion pounds. Pretax profit dropped 9 percent to 16.7
million pounds as “challenging” market conditions affected
margins.  Morgan Sindall bought Connaught’s maintenance business out
of administration last year, helping to boost revenue for its
affordable housing unit 32 percent to 228 million pounds. The
company also reduced the effect of government spending cuts by
reducing its share of public-sector work, which now accounts for
50 percent of business, compared with 60 percent a year earlier.  In February, Chairman John Morgan said the company expected
the private sector “to pick up some of the slack” from
spending cuts.  “In the last few downturns we’ve increased our market
share and we expect to do the same this time,” Morgan said in a
phone interview today. “Our biggest challenge at the moment is
how do we make the most of this so that we can look back in four
years time and say we had a good recession. Margins are very
tough but we’re in a strong place”  Morgan Sindall shares slipped 0.9 percent to 612 pence as
of 11:34 a.m. in  London . The stock has dropped 13 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 264.3 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
