Tanzania’s shilling,  Africa ’s third-
worst performing currency this year, may gain in the fourth
quarter when proceeds from coffee and cotton exports flow into
the country, Finance Minister Mustafa Mkulo said.  “More dollars will be coming, which will cause the
shilling to strengthen,” Mkulo said in response to a question
today in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital. “I can’t tell
you a figure, but what I can assure you is that it will be
stronger than what is is now.”  The shilling has weakened 7.2 percent so far this year and
was trading at 1,600 per dollar at 1:21 p.m. in Dar es Salaam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
