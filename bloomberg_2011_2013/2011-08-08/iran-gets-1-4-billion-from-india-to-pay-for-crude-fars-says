Iran  said it received 1 billion euros
($1.4 billion) from  India  for oil supplies and didn’t halt crude
exports to Indian refineries over delayed payments.  “Indian refineries debt until last week stood at $4.8
billion, but we have now received about 1 billion euros of it,”
National Iranian Oil Co. Managing Director Ahmad Qalebani was
quoted as saying today by the state-run  Fars  news agency. “So
in August, exports to India continued as in previous months.”  Iran is constrained by international sanctions over its
nuclear program, and Indian refiners have said banks are
unwilling to transfer payments for their purchases of the
Persian nation’s oil. Iran is the second-largest oil producer in
OPEC after  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
