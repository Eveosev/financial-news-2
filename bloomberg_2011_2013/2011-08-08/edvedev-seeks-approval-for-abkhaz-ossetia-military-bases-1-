Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
submitted for approval by the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, an agreement to form joint military bases in
 Georgia ’s two breakaway regions, the Kremlin said.  The accords were signed with Abkhazia and South Ossetia
last year, according to a statement e-mailed today.  Russia recognized the two separatist regions as sovereign
states after it routed Georgia’s army in a five-day war in 2008.
Today is the third anniversary of the start of the military
conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
