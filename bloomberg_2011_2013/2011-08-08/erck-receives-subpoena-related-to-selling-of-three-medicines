Merck & Co., the second-largest U.S.
drugmaker, received a subpoena from the  Department of Justice 
related to the sales of cancer and antiviral drugs.  The U.S. department asked for details of the marketing and
selling of Temodar, PegIntron and Intron A, from January 1, 2004
to the present “in a federal health-care investigation,” Merck
said today in a filing.  “This is the first disclosure of this matter,” Ronald
Rogers, a spokesman for Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based
Merck, said in an e-mail. The drugmaker is cooperating with the
investigation, Rogers said, declining to provide additional
information.  Temodar, used to treat  brain cancer , accounted for $1.07
billion in sales last year. Intron A for cancer and PegIntron
for hepatitis C together generated $946 million in sales.  Merck dropped $1.77 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $29.94 at
4:00 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading, the
lowest price since August 2009. The shares have declined 17
percent this year.  Pfizer Inc. is the biggest U.S. drugmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
