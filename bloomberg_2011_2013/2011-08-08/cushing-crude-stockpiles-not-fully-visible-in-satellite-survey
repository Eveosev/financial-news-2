Crude-oil inventories in Cushing,
Oklahoma, were not fully visible last week in a satellite
survey, according to data compiled by  DigitalGlobe Inc. (DGI)   Stockpile totals in floating-roof tanks at the hub were
ascertained for none of the 226 tanks, satellite images taken by
the Longmont, Colorado-based company show.  The Energy Department said Aug. 3 that Cushing inventories,
including floating and fixed tanks, totaled 36 million barrels.
Cushing is the physical delivery point for New York Mercantile
Exchange oil futures contracts and the largest crude-trading and
storage hub in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
