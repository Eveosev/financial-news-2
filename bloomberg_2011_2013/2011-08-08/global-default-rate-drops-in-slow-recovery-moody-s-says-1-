The rate of corporate defaults
worldwide declined last month and will remain low this year amid
a “slow” economic recovery, Moody’s Investors Service said.  Defaults on speculative-grade dropped to 1.9 percent in
July from 2.3 percent in June, and may end 2011 at 1.5 percent,
the New York-based ratings firm said today in a report. That
rate, which compares with 5.5 percent a year ago, may rise to
1.8 percent in 2012 as the risk of recession “remains
possible,” Moody’s said.  “As credit spreads have been rising, particularly in
 Europe , and a double-dip recession remains possible, there is
real risk that default rates could increase,” Sharon Ou, a
credit policy analyst at Moody’s, wrote in the report.  Defaults may rise as economic growth slows in the U.S. and
as European policy makers wrangle over ways to temper surging
borrowing costs in peripheral nations with heavy debt loads.
Sixteen companies rated by Moody’s have defaulted so far this
year, compared with 34 a year ago.  The extra yield that investors demand to hold junk-rated
corporate debt around the world instead of  government bonds  has
surged 130 basis points, or 1.3 percentage points, since April,
to 544 basis points, the highest level since September, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch data show.  High-yield, or junk, debt is graded below Baa3 by Moody’s
and BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
