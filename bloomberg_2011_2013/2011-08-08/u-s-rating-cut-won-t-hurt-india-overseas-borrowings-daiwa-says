Neelakantan Sethuram Iyer, chief
investment officer at Daiwa Asset Management ( India ) Pvt., which
manages about $179 million in assets, comments on the outlook
for Indian stocks after America lost its top rating.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index sank 2.6 percent
to 16,850.18, headed for the lowest level since June 9, 2010, at
11:09 a.m. in Mumbai. The gauge has dropped 20 percent from its
November peak, marking a so-called  bear market  for some
nvestors. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 2.7 percent at 2:40
p.m. in  Tokyo .  On stocks outlook:  “The overall sentiment is likely to weaken further.
Markets will stabilize after the initial knee-jerk reaction. It
is difficult to immediately predict how much this will impact in
the long term. Investors will watch how U.S. markets react.”  “In case of  Japan , a series of downgrades have led to rise
in borrowing costs. The U.S. downgrade will also lead to a spike
in borrowing costs and it will hurt a little bit.”  On overseas borrowings:  “The downgrade will not affect overseas fundraising by
Indian companies as that depends on individual company ratings
and the spreads they offer. Borrowing costs for U.S. companies
are likely to rise.”  On outlook for  U.S. dollar :  “The dollar is likely to strengthen in the short term. The
downgrade will affect the entire global economy and all
currencies. Therefore it is difficult to predict the long-term
impact of the ratings cut on the dollar.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
