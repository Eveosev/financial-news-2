India  rejected two of 37 solar
projects awarded in its first national auction, which aims to
generate 20,000 megawatts of sun-powered capacity by 2022.  NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam  Ltd., or NVVN, the state-run
power trader that will buy electricity from the plants, accepted
35 projects that were able to submit evidence they had arranged
funding, the government said in a  news release .  All seven solar-thermal projects, which account for 470
megawatts of capacity or 75 percent of what was awarded in the
December auction, made the cut,  Deepak Gupta , secretary of the
New and Renewable Energy ministry, said today in  New Delhi .  Companies building the larger thermal projects include
billionaire Anil Ambani’s  Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and  Lanco
Infratech Ltd. (LANCI) , one of India’s largest non-state power
producers. They had faced forfeiting as much as 1.89 billion
rupees ($42 million) in bank guarantees if not accepted.  Gupta declined to identify the two projects that were
rejected except to say in a phone interview that each held a
license to build a 5-megawatt photovoltaic plant.  Solar thermal plants use sunlight to heat liquids that
produce steam for generators; photovoltaic plants use panels to
turn sunlight directly into power.  The projects face no further deadlines before
commissioning, Gupta said. The 140 megawatts of photovoltaic
projects that have been accepted need to be completed by
January. The solar thermal projects have until 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
