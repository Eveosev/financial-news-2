PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) ,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, said it was subpoenaed
by federal prosecutors investigating lending practices at
National City Corp., which PNC agreed to buy in 2008.  The inquiry, which is in an early stage, concerns debts
insured by the Federal Housing Administration, and certain non-
FHA insured loan origination, sale and securitization practices,
Pittsburgh-based PNC said today in a  regulatory filing . The
probe is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Southern District of  New York .  “PNC is cooperating with the investigation,” according to
the filing. “The outcome of the investigation is unknown, but
it could result in penalties or other remedial actions.”  Fred Solomon , a spokesman for PNC, declined to comment.  At least 16 banks are facing scrutiny from the U.S. Housing
and Urban Development Department regarding losses on loans
insured by the FHA. HUD subpoenaed 15 mortgage companies in
January 2010 to seek out possible fraud. The agency sued
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest bank, in May for more than
$1 billion for allegedly lying “repeatedly” to qualify
thousands of risky mortgages for a government insurance program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
