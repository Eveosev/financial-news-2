Russian sales of new cars and light
commercial vehicles rose 27 percent in July from a year earlier,
slower than the previous month’s 40 percent growth, the
Association of European Businesses said.  Sales totaled 224,620 vehicles, led by 50,518 units for OAO
 AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) ’s Lada brand, the AEB said today in an e-mailed
 statement . Overall growth for the first seven months was 50
percent, putting  Russia  on target to sell 2.45 million autos
this year, more than the previous forecast of 2.35 million.  “The expected pattern of strong but slowing growth
continues into the second half,”  David Thomas , chairman of the
AEB’s automakers committee, said in the statement.  Last month, the government said it had distributed the
final 600,000 certificates in its so-called cash-for-clunkers
rebate program, which allowed Russians to receive 50,000 rubles
($1,724) toward the purchase of most locally made cars. The
program helped sales rise 30 percent last year, according to the
AEB.  Tolyatti-based AvtoVAZ, Russia’s largest carmaker, added to
declines after the statement. Its shares fell as much as 12.5
percent before pairing losses to close down 10 percent at 24.369
rubles. Sales declined 3 percent in July from a year earlier,
the AEB said, bringing year-to-date growth to 25 percent.  Sales at  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet brand advanced 76
percent in July, while  Renault SA (RNO) , which owns a quarter of
AvtoVAZ, boosted sales 57 percent, the statement said.  Russia may become  Europe ’s largest automobile market by the
end of this decade, reaching 4 million vehicles a year, provided
“global growth can overcome the present uncertainty,” Mark Ovenden, the committee’s deputy chairman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
