Taiwan ’s dollar ended little changed,
halting a four-day drop, as demand for the U.S. currency waned
after the world’s biggest economy lost its top  credit rating .  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major trading partners, declined and Asian
stocks retreated after  Standard & Poor’s  announced a one-level
reduction in the U.S. credit rating to AA+. Global funds slashed
their holdings of Taiwanese shares by $1.1 billion today, the
biggest daily net sales in four years, exchange data show.  “Volume remains thin today due to uncertainties about the
global economy,” said Henry Lin, a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “There are
some exporters buying the  Taiwan dollar  at this relatively weak
level.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed unchanged at NT$29.025 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$29.100 on Aug. 5, the weakest
level since April 20. The Taiex share index dropped 3.8 percent
to a 13-month low of 7,552.80.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 2 percent notes
due July 2016, the most-traded government debt, increased two
basis points to 1.104 percent, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. The rate reached 1.089 percent on Aug. 5, the
lowest level since April 28.  “The recent slump in yields was deemed excessive by some
investors, so we saw some profit-taking today,” said Eric Hsing,
a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose one basis point to 0.398 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
