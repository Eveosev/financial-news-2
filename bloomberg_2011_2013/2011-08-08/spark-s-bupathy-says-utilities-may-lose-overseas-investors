Vijaykumar Bupathy, assistant vice
president of research at Spark Capital Advisors, says stocks of
Indian power companies with foreign institutional investors will
suffer after  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. credit
rating.  Utilities in the second-fastest growing major economy are
raising funds globally to meet the government’s plan to add 100
gigawatts of electricity generation capacity by 2017. Bupathy
spoke by telephone from the southern city of Chennai.  “Companies with the greatest FII holdings stand to lose
the most today when there’s a mass pull-out from foreign
investors. That includes IVRCL Ltd.,  Lanco Infratech Ltd. (LANCI) ,
 Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR)  and  GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GMRI)   ‘‘GVK Power beat first-quarter expectations on Saturday,
which is why they are one of just a handful of companies that’’
gained today.  -- Editors: John Chacko, Paul Gordon  To contact the reporter on this story:
