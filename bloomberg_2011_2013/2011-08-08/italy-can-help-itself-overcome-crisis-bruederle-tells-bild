Italy can get through the sovereign
debt crisis without German help,  Rainer Bruederle , floor leader
of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Free Democratic Party coalition
partner, told  Bild newspaper  in an interview.  “Italy is not Greece,” he said, according to Bild.
“Italy can do this on its own.” Italy and Spain have to
“massively” consolidate their budgets and reduce their
deficits, said Bruederle, a former economy minister.  Bruederle said he doesn’t expect an economic slump in
Germany as a result of the debt crisis, Bild reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
