July, the third decline in four months, signaling a labor market

0.7 percent from June, when they rose a revised 3.8 percent,
according to an Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.
report released in  Melbourne  today.  National vacancies advertised in newspapers dropped by 0.5
percent in July, and Internet notices slid 0.7 percent, today’s
