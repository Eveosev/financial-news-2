Group of 20 nations pledged to take
“all necessary initiatives in a coordinated way” to ensure
financial sustainability, joining their Group of Seven
counterparts in pledging to shield the global economy from a
slump in investor confidence.  G-20 finance chiefs and central bankers also agreed to
foster economic growth “in a spirit of cooperation and
confidence,”  South Korea ’s Deputy Finance Minister Choi Jong Ku
said today in Gwacheon, South Korea.  Concern about the fallout from the U.S. sovereign-rating
downgrade and a slump in Italian and Spanish debt drove Asian
stocks lower today, extending the worst global slump since 2009.
G-7 authorities spoke earlier today Tokyo time and said they are
ready to act against disorderly currency movements as needed.  “We will remain in close contact throughout the coming
weeks and cooperate as appropriate, ready to take action to
ensure financial stability and liquidity in financial markets,”
G-20 nations said in the statement provided by the South Korean
finance ministry.  Officials of the G-20, which includes the G-7 and
developing nations, held a conference call yesterday, according
to Bambang Brodjonegoro, head of fiscal policy at  Indonesia ’s
 finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
