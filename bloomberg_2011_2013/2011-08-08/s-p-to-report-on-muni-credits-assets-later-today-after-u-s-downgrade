Standard & Poor’s  plans to release
“later today” reports on asset classes, including municipal
finance, affected by the company’s Aug. 5 downgrade of the U.S.,
said  John Chambers , head of S&P’s sovereign ratings committee.  “As far as U.S. public finance is concerned, other than
some particular transactions that are directly linked to the
U.S. government, we said we would be looking carefully at some of
the indirect effects, if you like, on possible fiscal
consolidation programs in Washington as they might impact the
budgetary decisions of state and local governments,” he said on
a conference call today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
