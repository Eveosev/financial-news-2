Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the private-
equity firm that got financing this month for a 1.2 billion-euro
($1.7 billion) wind farm in the German North Sea, plans further
investment in the countryâ€™s offshore wind parks, Handelsblatt
reported, citing Managing Director Sean Klimczak.  Blackstone will build a second wind farm, called
Noerdlicher Grund, off the island of Sylt, and will look at more
projects in the next few years, the newspaper said, citing an
interview with Klimczak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
