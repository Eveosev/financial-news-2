Standard & Poor’s  said the decision
to strip the U.S. of its AAA rating won’t affect companies in
the country that carry the top grade.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ,  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and
 Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP) , the four U.S.-based non-
financial companies rated AAA, will retain the highest rating,
S&P said in a statement today. The companies are expected to pay
their debts even if the U.S. defaults.  Exxon, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft are strong
financially and depend less on the U.S. than other companies do
because they get much of their income from international
markets, S&P said.  While ADP earns most of its profits domestically, demand
for its products has held up well and it relies little on the
public sector and is diversified, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
