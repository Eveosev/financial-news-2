Washington Nationals pitcher  Stephen Strasburg  made his first minor-league rehabilitation start since
undergoing surgery 11 months ago to replace a torn ligament in
his throwing elbow.  Strasburg, who signed a record $15 million, four-year
contract as the No. 1 pick in the 2009 Major League Baseball
draft, pitched 1 2/3 innings yesterday for the Nationals’ Class-
A team in Hagerstown,  Maryland . He threw 25 of his 31 pitches
for strikes and allowed three hits, including a solo home run,
while striking out four batters.  Strasburg, whose fastball was consistently clocked at 97
miles an hour on radar guns according to  MLB.com , may make up to
five more rehab starts in the minors before joining the
Nationals in September.  “My goal is to pitch in the big leagues in September,”
Strasburg told reporters. “It’s a lot longer process than many
people think. Come Spring Training next year, I should be back
to normal.”  Strasburg had a 5-3 record with a 2.91 earned run average
and 92 strikeouts in 12 starts last season. In his major league
debut on June 8, he had a team-record 14 strikeouts. Strasburg
had so-called Tommy John surgery in September 2010 to replace
his right ulnar collateral ligament, a procedure that usually
takes 12 to 18 months for recovery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
