Following are comments from Miswin Mahesh, commodities analyst at  Barclays Capital , on export-coal
prices at Richards Bay in  South Africa , site of the continent’s
biggest terminal for shipping the fuel.  Mahesh commented today by e-mail from London.  “We expect South African prices to fall until Q4, given
that it is currently at the bottom of the shopping list for
consumers in both basins. Indian consumers are waiting at the
sidelines -- they haven’t bought a lot of South African coal
this year, as they have shown preference for cheaper-quality
coal from Indonesia.”  “In Q4, prices will be supported as India is expected to
return after the monsoons, and there would be cargoes flowing
into Europe for their restocking needs and winter demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
