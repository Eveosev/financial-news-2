Malaysia ’s ringgit gained on
speculation last week’s biggest loss in more than a year was
excessive.  The currency halted a four-day drop as Macquarie Group Ltd.
predicted that Malaysia will be among the main beneficiaries of
inflows into the region after the U.S. lost its top  credit
rating . The Dollar Index in  New York  dropped for a second day
after Standard & Poor’s lowered the world’s biggest economy’s
credit rating by one level to AA+ on Aug. 5, keeping the outlook
at “negative.”  “The selling was overdone last week on concerns that the
U.S. economy may slow,” said Syhiful Zamri, director of
investment, research and advisory at Kenanga Investors Bhd. in
 Kuala Lumpur . “The appreciation in some currencies is due to
the dollar’s weakness as S&P’s downgrade is making people
question the safety of the greenback.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.6 percent to 2.9985 per dollar
as of 9:12 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency slumped 1.6 percent last week, the most
since May 2010.  Malaysian government bonds were little changed. The yield
on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016 was 3.40 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  “The Middle East is becoming increasingly comfortable with
Malaysia’s capital markets, which may lead to increasing their
global bond allocations into the ringgit,” Singapore-based
strategist Matt Huang wrote in a report issued by Macquarie on
Aug. 6. “It is a natural investment destination as part of a
portfolio re-allocation away from the U.S.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
