OAO Polymetal, a Russian producer
of gold and silver, jumped the most in more than two weeks in 
Moscow trading as both metals advanced.  The company’s shares rallied 3.8 percent to 538.5 rubles by
11:02 a.m. local time, the biggest intraday gain since July 18.  Gold climbed above $1,700 an ounce for the first time after
 Standard & Poor’s  cut the top U.S. credit rating, fueling a
slump in equities and the dollar. Silver for September delivery
surged as much as 5.7 percent to $40.40 an ounce on the Comex.  OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia ’s largest gold producer, rose 2.9
percent to 1,698.7 rubles in its third day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
