Ukraine’s state-run exporter Khlib
Investbud plans to increase its grain exports by fourfold to 5
million metric tons in the marketing year that started July 1,
Dnipropetrovsk-based researcher  APK-Inform  reported, citing
Robert Brovdi, the company’s general director.  Brovdi said he expects Ukraine to export mainly feed grain
because of rains that affected the quality of cereals, according
to APK-Inform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
