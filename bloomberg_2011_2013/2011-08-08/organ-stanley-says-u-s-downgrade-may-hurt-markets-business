Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth largest
U.S. bank by assets, said  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the
nation’s credit rating may have a “material adverse” impact on
financial markets and the firm’s business.  The downgrade could affect the firm’s credit ratings and
require it to post more collateral on some loans, the New York-
based company said today in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Spreads in money markets and other short-
term rates already increased in anticipation of the downgrade,
the bank said.  “Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit
rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the
ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial
condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be
immediately apparent,” the firm wrote.  Group of Seven and Group of 20 leaders said they are ready
to stabilize financial markets after S&P lowered the top U.S.
rating by one level to AA+. Policy makers held emergency
conference calls over the weekend to try to stave off weakening
investor confidence that has already wiped out about $5.4
trillion in global equity values since July 26.  “It could disrupt payment systems, money markets, long-
term or short-term fixed-income markets, foreign-exchange
markets,  commodities markets  and equity markets and adversely
affect the cost and availability of funding,” Morgan Stanley
said of the downgrade in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
