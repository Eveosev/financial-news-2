NTR Plc, an Irish developer of roads,
power and waste projects, agreed to buy 228  wind turbines  from
 General Electric Co. (GE)  for sites in Oklahoma and  Kansas  as it
focuses on wind investments after exiting the solar industry.  NTR’s Wind Capital Group unit will acquire 134 turbines
with 1.5 megawatts of capacity and 94 units with 1.6 megawatts
in the first half of next year, the Dublin-based company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The Osage and Post Rock
projects, totaling 351 megawatts, will increase the unit’s
installed capacity in the U.S. to more than 500 megawatts.  NTR, which also has interests in biofuels, wrote off the
entire value of its investments in solar-thermal energy on Aug.
3 as it posted record full-year losses. The company is making
“substantial” investments to expand in wind, it said in
today’s statement.  “Renewable energy remains a core sector for NTR and we
would not rule out future investments in solar if the
opportunity and returns are in the best interests of
shareholders,” Rachel Watchorn, an NTR spokeswoman, said by e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
