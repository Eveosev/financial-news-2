German pharmaceutical companies must
grant more than 2 billion euros ($2.8 billion) in discounts on
prescription drugs this year, Handelsblatt reported, citing a
study from market research firm  IMS Health.   Legislation that came into force last year increased
mandatory discounts on prescription drugs to 16 percent from 6
percent and that will mean 1.2 billion euros in additional
discounts this year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
