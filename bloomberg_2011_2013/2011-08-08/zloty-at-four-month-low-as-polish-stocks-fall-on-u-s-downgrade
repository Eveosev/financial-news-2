The zloty slid to its weakest in more
than four months against the euro and Polish stocks headed for
the longest stretch of declines in 2 1/2 years after  Standard &
Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating, driving investors from
riskier assets.  The Polish currency depreciated as much as 0.9 percent to
4.0688 per euro, its lowest since March 21, and traded down 0.8
percent to 4.0655 as of 5:40 p.m. in Warsaw. The WIG20 equity
gauge fell 2.3 percent to 2,390.01, its sixth day of declines
and the longest losing streak since January 2009.  Stocks fell worldwide and most emerging-market currencies
weakened as the loss of the U.S.’s top rating fueled concern
that the global economy will slow.  “The U.S. credit downgrade is likely to trigger a major
shock to global risk appetite and emerging-market assets are
going to be under significant pressure,” strategists at Societe
Generale SA wrote in a report earlier today. “In the near term,
going outright short emerging markets makes total sense from a
tactical standpoint and any long positions should be squared.”  The zloty retreated 2.6 percent against the Swiss franc to
3.7789, after earlier retreating 2.7 percent to a record-low of
3.7828.  To contact the reporter on this story:
