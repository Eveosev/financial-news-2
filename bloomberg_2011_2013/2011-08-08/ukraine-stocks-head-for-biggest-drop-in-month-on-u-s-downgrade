Ukrainian stocks tumbled the most in
more than 14 months after the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating
for the first time at  Standard & Poor’s , prompting investors to
retreat from riskier emerging markets.  VAT Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest crude oil producer, plunged
as much as 12 percent before paring losses to trade 1.2 percent
lower. VAT Azovstal Iron & Steel Works, the Ukrainian steel
producer controlled by billionaire  Rinat Akhmetov , tumbled 13
percent. The  Ukrainian Equities Index (UX)  fell 8.3 percent to
1,952.59 by the close in Kiev, its biggest loss since May 25,
2010. The measure has slumped 16 percent in five days.  Stocks retreated worldwide after S&P cut the U.S. rating to
AA+ on Aug. 5. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index headed for its
biggest five-day tumble since October 2008.  “A lot of the local investors have capitulated, which has
led to the sell-off,” Jathan Tucker, head of sales trading at
BG Capital investment bank in Kiev, said by phone. “We haven’t
hit rock-bottom until we see some institutional support for
monetary stimulus.”  Ukraine’s PFTS Index lost 6.2 percent to 780.73 today, its
lowest close since November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
