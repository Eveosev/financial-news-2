August 8 (Bloomberg) -- The stunning image of the ex-Egyptian president in the dock last week provoked many commentators throughout the Mideast to embrace the idea of an authoritarian ruler being brought to account. Even independently owned newspapers generally supportive of their own monarchs and “presidents-for-life” ran columns and editorials overwhelmingly praising the Egyptian judicial process as  Hosni Mubarak  made his first court appearance in his trial on charges of corruption and murder, which he denies. It was "a memorable day in the history of Egypt” and the entire Arab nation, wrote columnist  Rashid Hasan  in  Jordan 's Ad-Dustour, a pro-monarchy daily. Mubarak is said to be suffering from a heart ailment and was bed-ridden throughout his court appearance. The trial, Hasan wrote, demonstrates that “the president of the republic is not a Pharaoh but a public employee, on whom laws and regulations are applied and, accordingly, that he can be put on trial.” Egypt is no longer “a ranch for the ruler, and the Egyptian people are no longer mere slaves on the president's farm,” he concluded. Hasan did not refer to the widening protest movement against the regime in his own country. In the same newspaper, columnist  Rakan al-Majali  went further, writing: Al-Majali wrote, “I remembered this when I watched ousted President Mubarak put on trial and recent tensions in Arab countries.” He did not specify which countries he meant. In an editorial, the Saudi-based, pro-monarchy  Al-Jazirah , a daily, noted that the Egyptian judiciary is “known for its ability to conduct fair trials." It continued: In Qatar, a monarchy, columnist  Taha Khalifah  took the argument one step further, arguing in a piece published by the newspaper Al-Rayah: In Israel, one of the main Arabic dailies, Kul Al-Arab, more directly attacked its own government, saying in an editorial that Mubarak’s trial represents “the fate of those who do not respect the will of their people, the fate of the thieves, and the fate of those who believe that  Israel  and America are capable of protecting them regardless of the obscenities they commit against their people.” In Egypt, there was even more widespread praise for the trial. Several dailies that had long served as mouthpieces for Mubarak expressed popular feelings of jubilation but warned of potential pitfalls along the route to justice. The most widely circulated daily,  Al-Ahram , wrote in an editorial that there was “no doubt” Mubarak regrets “abandoning his people's rights.” But regret and remorse “are useless.” The rest of the Arab leaders should "learn the lesson" from seeing "the first Arab leader in a dock” not tainted by foreign occupation, as in  Iraq . Otherwise, they will “continue to shed the blood of their people to remain in their positions, which will not last no matter what they do.” In a  subsequent editorial , the daily acknowledged that “some flaws” had affected the first day of the trial. The courtroom, Al-Ahram warned, is a “miniature model of any society” and if sensationalism prevails over it -- a reference to one lawyer who insisted on DNA testing to see if the man in court was actually Mubarak -- “this will prove that society is enduring the same problems. So please, let us all offer a civilized image of a just and democratic Egypt in a post-revolution phase.” One columnist stood out against the overall trend:  Tariq Al-Homayed , editor-in-chief of the London-based Asharq al-Awsat, a daily owned by a leading member of the Saudi royal family. “Egypt is going from bad to worse,” he lamented. This last assertion departed from conventional wisdom among most Arab columnists -- even those writing in other Saudi-owned newspapers -- that Mubarak was in fact forced from power against his will. Continuing, Al-Homayed hit on a theme that a number of other commentators also broached: the need to connect Mubarak’s trial to one for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who, Al-Homayed wrote, "is openly killing his own people today.” According to human rights organizations, more than 1,600 Syrians have been killed in the last few months, and the regime has now resorted to full-fledged assaults in major cities across the country. In Egypt, more than 800 people died in the weeks before Mubarak relinquished the presidency. Al-Homayed concluded by turning to Iraq. “The Egyptian people must ask themselves the following questions today: is Iraq now witnessing its best times after  Saddam Hussein  was brought to trial and executed? Are the Iraqis today witnessing a good state of affairs under a regime that called for revenge?” he asked, referring to the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who approved the execution of ex-President Saddam. He argued that Mubarak’s court appearance “was nothing more than a day of revenge against an unarmed and sick man.” Instead of a trial, al-Homayed recommended that Egypt adopt the South African model of a national reconciliation process, including a general amnesty, for Mubarak and others, “in order to help to build a strong state.” That was a suggestion not likely to find many followers, given the strength of the consensus that in trying Mubarak, Egypt was on the right path and the defendant was just where he ought to be.
