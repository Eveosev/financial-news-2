While hot weather grips the southern
U.S. Plains, the Northeast probably wonâ€™t see a return to
anything like a heat wave until at least Aug. 18, said  Matt Rogers , president of  Commodity Weather Group  LLC.  In his 11- to 15-day forecast, Rogers said the heat that is
concentrated over the south-central U.S. may expand into the
Northeast. The hottest weather in the U.S. will stay centered on
Oklahoma and northern  Texas  through Aug. 22.  Excessive heat warnings and advisories are in effect over
the area and as far east as Tennessee and northern Alabama. A
heat advisory has also been posted for the Atlantic Coast from
 North Carolina  to Georgia, according to the  National Weather
Service.   Temperatures in Dallas are forecast to be above 100 degrees
Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) through this week. Dallas has had 37
consecutive days with temperatures over 100, five fewer than the
record of 42 in 1980, according to the weather service.  In  Fort Smith , Arkansas, the temperature has been above 100
for a record 34 straight days, according to the weather service.
The old record was 17 days in 1934.  Natural gas traders monitor weather forecasts to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
