Tanzania plans to borrow $525 million
in the 2011-2012 financial year to invest in improving its road
and rail networks, Finance MinisterMustafa Mkulo said.  That will be in addition to the $250 million loan agreed
with Stanbic Bank Tanzania, the local unit of  South Africa ’s
Standard Bank Group Ltd., he told reporters today in the
commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam . Tanzania will seek raise at
least $450 million in the 2012-13 period, he said.  “This shows the level of confidence our investors have in
our economy,” Mkulo said.  The government of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
plans to build new roads and rail lines to mainly areas with
“highest economic potential,” such as agriculture, mining and
tourism, according to its five-year development plan.  Most of Tanzania’s rail network was built before 1924,
during the German colonial era, to transport agricultural
products including sisal and coffee to the coast for export to
 Europe .  The loan arranged by Stanbic Bank Tanzania from a group of
lenders is for seven years, with a two-year grace period and
after that a 5.2 percent annual interest rate, Mkulo said.  Tanzania vies with  Mali  to be Africa’s third-largest
producer of gold, and hosts the world’s only known deposit of
tanzanite on the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro. It also ranks among
Africa’s top five producers of cashew nuts, cotton, tea, coffee
and sisal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
