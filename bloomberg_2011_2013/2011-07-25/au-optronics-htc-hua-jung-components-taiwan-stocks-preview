8,683.51.  Acer Inc. (2353)  (2353 TT) lost 4.7 percent to NT$39.6, the
biggest drop since July 6, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut
its price forecast and earnings-per-share estimates in a report
dated July 22. The brokerage said it doesn’t see “significant
synergies” from Acer acquiring cloud-computing company iGware,
adding that company is “clearly losing its advantage” in the
laptop market. Goldman Sachs lowered its price estimate to NT$30
from NT$34 and kept Acer on its “conviction sell” list.  Coretronic Corp. (5371)  (5371 TT), a maker of liquid-crystal
display projectors and LCD backlights, surged 6.9 percent to
NT$35.50, the biggest gain since May 26, 2010, on speculation
the company has received Apple Inc. iPad orders, said Jerry Bau,
an analyst at Jih Sun Securities Co. Huei-Ping Wen, spokeswoman
for the company, didn’t immediately answer calls to her office.   Foxconn Technology Co. (2354 TT), a casing maker, jumped
5.6 percent to NT$140.50, the highest close since June 7, after
KGI Securities Co. said in a note the company is one of the top
picks for component makers. The shares have gained 20 percent
this year, lagging behind other Apple component suppliers such
as Catcher Technology Co., which has more than doubled in 2011.  Hua Jung Components Co. (5328 TT) advanced 1.7 percent to
NT$7.99. The power supplies maker’s board approved plans to buy
