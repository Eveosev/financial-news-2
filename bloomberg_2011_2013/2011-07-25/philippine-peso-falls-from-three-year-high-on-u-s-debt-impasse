Philippine  government bonds  fell
after the central bank said gains in consumer prices may have
accelerated this month. The peso reached a three-year high.  Annual inflation will be between 4.3 percent and 5.2
percent in July, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said today. Consumer prices rose 4.6 percent in June
from a year earlier, according to official data published July 5.
Thirteen of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast policy
makers will maintain the benchmark  interest rate  at 4.5 percent
on July 28. The rest predict a quarter-percentage point increase.  “Inflation still hasn’t peaked,” said Marcelo Ayes,
senior vice president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in
Manila. “The momentum is still continuous because of pressures
from commodities. There may still be more rate hikes.”  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7 percent notes due
March 2017 climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 5.18 percent as of 4:27 p.m. in  Manila , according to prices
from ICAP Plc.  “Although still elevated, inflation pressures seem to have
moderated,” Tetangco said. “There still remain risks
particularly with respect to volatilities in international
commodity prices and the impact of foreign-exchange inflows on
domestic liquidity.”  The peso traded at 42.405 per dollar compared with 42.403
on July 22, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It earlier reached
42.360, the strongest level since May 2008.  To contact the reporter for this story:
