Crude oil premiums in the U.S. Gulf
fluctuated as the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate and Brent narrowed.  The gap decreased 6 cents to $18.74 a barrel based on
today’s settlement prices. The spread settled at a record high
of $22.63 a barrel July 14. When Brent falls versus WTI, it
decreases the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with
West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium added 10 cents to $20 a
barrel over WTI as of 2:18 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed
75 cents a barrel to $21 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend gained 75 cents to $15.50 while Poseidon gained 75 cents
to $15.25 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium advanced 25 cents to $11.50
a barrel. West Texas Sour was unchanged at $1.25 below the
benchmark. Thunder Horse lost $1.40 to $19.60.  The premium for Syncrude added $1.05 to $11.75 a barrel, a
two-month high. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil
derived from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 25 cents to
$19 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
