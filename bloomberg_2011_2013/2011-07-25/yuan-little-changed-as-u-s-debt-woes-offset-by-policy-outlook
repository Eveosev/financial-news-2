China ’s yuan advanced to its
strongest level in 17 years after President  Hu Jintao  vowed to
maintain efforts to rein in inflation.  Stabilizing prices will be a priority and the government
will persist with its “prudent” monetary policy in the second
half of the year, Xinhua News Agency reported on July 22, citing
Hu. The currency fell as much as 0.04 percent earlier as U.S.
lawmakers failed to agree on a proposal to raise the nation’s
debt ceiling and reduce the risk of a default.  “Hu’s comments have given some support to the currency as
investors expect yuan appreciation to be one of the inflation-
curbing tools,” said Edmond Law, deputy head of foreign
exchange at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “The yuan isn’t
moving much since investors are still waiting for the outcome of
the U.S. debt talks.”  The yuan rose 0.01 percent to close at 6.4450 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency touched 6.4445, the strongest level since the
country unified official and market exchange rates at the end of
1993.  U.S. political leaders have a “more than 80 percent
chance” of reaching a “temporary” agreement on raising the
debt limit, Zhang Ming, deputy director of the international
finance research unit of the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences ,
wrote in a report.  The People’s Bank of China set the daily fixing 0.01
percent weaker at 6.4503. The yuan is allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the  reference rate .  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency was little
changed at 6.4460. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell
0.05 percent to 6.3835, a 1 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
