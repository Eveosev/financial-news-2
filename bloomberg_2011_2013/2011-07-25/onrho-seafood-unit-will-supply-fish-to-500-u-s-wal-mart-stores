Lonrho Plc (LAF) , a U.K. holding with
stakes in transportation and agribusiness companies in Africa,
said a deal by its  Oceanfresh  unit to supply seafood to  Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. (WMT)  will double its sales in the U.S.  The agreement to sell South African wild hake filets to 500
Wal-Mart stores “is potentially doubling our business in the
U.S., as we already supply 435 stores owned by  Costco Wholesale
Corp. (COST) ,” Chief Executive Officer Geoffrey White said in a phone
interview from Lonrho’s London headquarters today.  “We are seeing continuing demand from retailers in the
U.S. for South African produce, and this deal will grow
Oceanfresh’s revenue nicely,” White said.  Oceanfresh, 51 percent-owned by Lonrho, will add more than
100 jobs in  South Africa  as a result of the deal, according to a
regulatory filing today.  Lonrho’s agribusiness division, which includes Oceanfresh,
accounted for about half of the company’s first-half revenue of
61.1 million pounds ($99.5 million), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Oceanfresh “forms a significant part” of the
agribusiness unit, White said.  The Wal-Mart deal will not affect other global supply
agreements signed by Oceanfresh, which is 41 percent owned by
management, White said. The company supplies all the major
retailers in South Africa, plus others in Canada and Asia, he
said.
