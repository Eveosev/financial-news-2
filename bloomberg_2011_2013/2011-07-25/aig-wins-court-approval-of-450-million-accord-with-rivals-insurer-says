American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, said its plan to pay $450 million
to resolve claims of cheating a workers’ compensation program
was given preliminary approval by a U.S. judge.  “AIG is pleased that the court stated today that it will
grant preliminary approval of the proposed settlement,” Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, said in an e-mailed
statement. The order couldn’t be immediately confirmed in court
records. A clerk for U.S. District Judge Sidney Schenkier in
 Chicago  declined to comment.  The settlement reached by AIG in January is less than a
third of the amount requested by Liberty Mutual Holding Co. AIG
was accused underreporting the amount of premiums it collected
on workers’ compensation policies to reduce payments to an
industry-funded backstop.  “We want to evaluate the judge’s written opinion before
offering any comment,” said John Cusolito, a spokesman for
 Liberty Mutual , which sued AIG in 2009.  AIG fell 14 cents to $28.95 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock
Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
