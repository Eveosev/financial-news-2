U.S. stocks pared losses as a rally
in technology shares helped erase an early slump that was
triggered by concern lawmakers will fail to reach a compromise
to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a government default.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped less than 0.2
percent to 1,342.99 at 12:46 p.m. in  New York  after losing as
much as 1 percent in the first half hour of trading. Intuit Inc.
and Motorola Solutions Inc. climbed more than 1.8 percent to
lead technology companies to the biggest gain among 10 groups in
the index.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
