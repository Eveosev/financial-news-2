The  New Zealand dollar  gained to a
record and Australia’s advanced as investors sought alternatives
to the greenback with U.S. lawmakers remaining at odds over how
to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default.  The Aussie reached its highest versus its U.S. counterpart
in more than two months before a report tomorrow forecast to
show the nation’s consumer price index rose in the second
quarter. Central bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  said Australia’s
subdued household spending will likely rebound “at some point”
amid a mining boom.  “There’s definitely been Asian central-bank buying and
that’s been one of the significant factors supporting the
kiwi,” said Tim Kelleher, vice president of institutional
banking and markets at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia  in
Auckland. “The risk is probably a stronger number” for
Australia’s inflation report, he said.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.7 percent to 87.04 U.S. cents
at 10:55 a.m. in New York after reaching as high as 87.43 U.S.
cents, the strongest since it was freely floated in 1985. It
gained 0.4 percent to 67.89 yen from 67.66 yen.  Australia’s currency advanced 1 percent to $1.0948, the
strongest since May 3. The Aussie climbed 0.6 percent to 85.44
yen from 84.91 yen, the strongest in two weeks.  President  Barack Obama  said in a prime-time address from
the White House that the nation’s burgeoning debt threatens to
do “serious” damage to the  U.S. economy  and that Congress must
compromise to address future deficits.  Australia’s consumer prices increased 3.4 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
