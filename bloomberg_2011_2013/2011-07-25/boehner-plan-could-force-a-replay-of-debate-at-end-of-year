House Speaker  John Boehner ’s two-
phase debt-ceiling proposal may force a replay of the current
fight early next year if Congress doesn’t slash at least $1.6
trillion from the deficit by late December, according to a
person familiar with the plan.  Under the proposal, the person said, a joint House-Senate
committee would have to report by Nov. 23 on a deficit-cutting
package and Congress would have to enact it by Dec. 23 for
President  Barack Obama  to receive additional borrowing
authority. The person requested anonymity to discuss the plan
before it was formally released.  Republican aides say the measure would immediately raise
the debt ceiling by roughly $1 trillion while cutting slightly
more in federal spending. It would force additional cuts before
making a second borrowing boost available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
