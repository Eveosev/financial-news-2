Agrokor d.d. and Atlantic Grupa
d.d., Croatian closely held companies, will each sell their 13
percent stake in RTL Hrvatska to RTL Group,  Europe ’s biggest
television broadcaster.  Agrokor and Atlantic decided to quit RTL Hrvatska’s
ownership structure to “focus on their core business,”
according to a joint statement sent by e-mail today.  Both companies will retain their position on the
supervisory board of RTL Hrvatska, the statement said, adding
that Atlantic will keep the “symbolic ownership” of 0.1
percent of the local network’s shares.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story:
