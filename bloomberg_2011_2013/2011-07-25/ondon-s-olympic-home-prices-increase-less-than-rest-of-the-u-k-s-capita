Home prices  close to  London ’s 2012
Olympic sites have risen less than the rest of the city since
the Games were announced, as overseas buyers targeted more
central districts,  Zoopla.co.uk  said.  Values for homes near the Olympic Stadium and the other
venues in east London have climbed 18.9 percent since the city
was awarded the Games in July 2005, the real-estate website said
in a statement today. That compares with an average increase of
27.2 percent across the U.K. capital.  “The Olympic areas have done well, but they just haven’t
matched central London,” Nicholas Leeming, business development
director at Zoopla, said by telephone. “The London central
market is driven by international demand, prompted by concerns
about the euro zone and instability in the  Middle East . London
is perceived to be a secure financial, political and economic
location.”  The Games of the 30th Olympiad will be held in the borough
of Newham, the sixth-most deprived district in England,
according to a government survey carried out in 2007. London won
the right to stage the world’s biggest athletic competition
after persuading the  International Olympic Committee  that the
9.3 billion-pound ($15 billion) event would help to regenerate
neighborhoods in the east of the city.  In the past six years, residential property prices in the
U.K. as a whole have climbed 7.2 percent, Zoopla estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
