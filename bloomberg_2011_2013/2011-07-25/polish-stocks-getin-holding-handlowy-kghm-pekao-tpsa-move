Poland’s WIG20 Index fell for the
first time in five days, losing 16.58, or 0.6 percent, to
2,726.88 at 2:27 p.m. in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit SpA,
slid 3.1 zloty, or 1.9 percent, to 158.9 zloty. Bank Handlowy SA
(BHW PW), a unit of Citigroup Inc., declined 1.3 zloty, or 1.5
percent, to 84.2 zloty and  Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the
financial-services group controlled by Polish billionaire Leszek
Czarnecki, dropped 0.14 zloty, or 1.1 percent, to 12.49 zloty.  Banks declined in  Europe  after Moody’s Investors Service
downgraded Greece’s sovereign-credit rating.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, fell 3.3 zloty, or 1.8 percent, to
185.7 zloty, snapping a two-day advance. Copper declined as a
lack of progress in raising the U.S. debt ceiling boosted
concern that the world’s largest economy may default, hurting
industrial commodities.  Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS)  , Poland’s largest phone
company, rose for a second day, adding 0.16 zloty, or 1 percent,
to 16.56 zloty. The Warsaw District Court suspended proceedings
in a case to enforce payment of a 1.57 billion-zloty ($564
million) arbitration judgment against Telekomunikacja.  To contact the reporter on this story:
