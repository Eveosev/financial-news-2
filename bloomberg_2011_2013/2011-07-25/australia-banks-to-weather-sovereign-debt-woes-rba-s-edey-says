Australian banks are well positioned
to weather global financial disruptions from sovereign debt
concerns abroad because they emerged from the prior crisis in
“good shape,” said Malcolm Edey, the  Reserve Bank  of
 Australia ’s assistant governor for the financial system.  “The Australian banks have only limited direct exposures
to sovereign debt in the countries regarded as being most at
risk,” Edey said today in the text of remarks to be delivered
in Darwin. “So potential effects on Australian banks’ overall
asset quality are not an issue.”  Since the credit crisis that began in 2008, Australian
banks have “significantly” strengthened their balance sheets
and reduced risks, Edey said.  “They have increased their reliance on domestic deposit
funding, lengthened the average term of their wholesale funding,
and correspondingly reduced their reliance on short-term
wholesale debt,” Edey said. “These changes will help to make
them more resilient to any disruptive event in international
credit markets, should it occur.”  Edey said banks have a renewed sense of caution about
lending and funding themselves, while businesses and households
are also demonstrating restraint.  “In the post-crisis environment, borrowers and investors
are more cautious than they were, both at home and abroad,” he
said. “That’s likely to mean less demand for leverage and more
reliance on equity funding, even when the economy itself is
growing strongly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
