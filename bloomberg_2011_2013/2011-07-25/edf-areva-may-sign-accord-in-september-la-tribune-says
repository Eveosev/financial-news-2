Electricite de France SA and Areva
SA will today sign a technical agreement as a prelude to a more
wide-ranging accord that may be signed in September, French
daily La Tribune reported, without citing anyone.  Topics still under discussion are a joint export offer by
the companies, development of the Atmea reactor and uranium
supply for EDF, the newspaper said. It’s possible that EDF will
take a stake in Areva’s mining unit, La Tribune added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
