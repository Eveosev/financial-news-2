Inflation in Djibouti slowed to 4.4
percent in June as some food prices and transport costs
declined, the Department of Statistics and Demographic Studies
said.  The inflation rate dropped from 5.2 percent in May, the
Djibouti-based agency said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
Price growth was 0.6 percent in the month, it said.  Prices of foods including potatoes fell 1.6 percent in the
month, while transport costs fell 0.4 percent from May, the
department said.  Djibouti, which hosts about 2,500 U.S. military personnel
at the  Camp Lemonnier  military base, is a Horn of Africa nation
about the size of the U.S. state of  Massachusetts . The country
has a $982 million economy with fewer than 1 million people that
relies on services related to its strategic location on the Red
Sea, one of the worldâ€™s busiest shipping lanes, according to the
U.S. State Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
