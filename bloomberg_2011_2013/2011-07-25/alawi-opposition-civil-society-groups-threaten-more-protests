Malawi opposition parties and civil
society groups said they would organize more protests, similar
to those on July 20 that left 18 people dead, if the government
arrests organizers of the demonstrations.  “The intimidatory language will not be tolerated,” the
Public Affairs Committee, a multi-faith organization that
includes the Malawi Council of Churches, said in a statement
handed to reporters. “Bullets and tear gas have never triumphed
over the will of the people.”  On July 22, President Bingu wa Mutharika threatened to
prosecute organizers of the demonstrations that took place in
the towns of Mzuzu, Lilongwe, Blantyre and Karonga. Police
fought with thousands of protesters who were demanding an end to
fuel and currency shortages and a reduction in poverty.  “I will smoke you out wherever you are because you have no
right to destroy our peace,” Mutharika said. “I have been
patient long enough. I want to tell you enough is enough.”  The opposition United Democratic Front called on the
president to stop issuing threats and admit that the police
fired on unarmed demonstrators.  “President Mutharika must demonstrate sincere regret and
remorse for the injury done and must be ready to apologize for
his role in inflicting pain and injury to millions on
Malawians,” the party said in a statement handed to reporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
