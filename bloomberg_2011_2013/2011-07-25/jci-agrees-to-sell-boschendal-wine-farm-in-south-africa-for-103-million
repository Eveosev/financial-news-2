A controlling stake in Boschendal, a
South African wine estate once owned by Cecil John Rhodes and
later  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , will be sold by its current owner,  JCI
Ltd. (JCD) , for 700 million rand ($104 million).  Johannesburg’s JCI Ltd., a former unit of Anglo that later
that had its stock exchange listing suspended in 2005, will sell
its 62.67 percent stake in the estate in the country’s Western
Cape province to Cinmark Twenty Seven Ltd., it said in a
regulatory filing late yesterday.  Boschendal  was established in 1685 by a Protestant family
that had fled France because of religious persecution. The farm
was later bought by mining magnate and politician Cecil John
Rhodes. After his death in 1902, the estate was taken over by
diamond producer  De Beers , followed by Anglo in 1969, according
to its website.  The 2,240 hectare (5,535 acres) farm is situated between
the towns of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek and consists of 254
hectares of vineyards, several restaurants and a retirement
village along the slopes of the Simonsberg Mountain. The farm
produces a variety of wines including the Pavillon range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
