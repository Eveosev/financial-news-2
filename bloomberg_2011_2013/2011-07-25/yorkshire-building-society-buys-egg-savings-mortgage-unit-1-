Yorkshire Building Society , the
customer-owned lender merging with Norwich & Peterborough
Building Society, agreed to buy  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s Egg mortgage
and savings businesses.  The units comprise a 2.5 billion-pound ($4 billion) savings
book and a 430 million-pound mortgage book, the lender said in a
statement today. Yorkshire will also acquire the Egg brand, the
lender added.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  agreed to buy Egg’s U.K. credit card business
in March to add 1.15 million accounts. Citigroup Inc. bought
Egg’s internet banking unit for 575 million pounds in 2007 from
 Prudential Plc. (PRU)   “Egg’s substantial savings book, which is predominantly
internet savings, will enhance Yorkshire’s existing funding
position and increase its capacity to lend,” Yorkshire said in
the statement.  One of  Europe ’s first Internet banks, Egg was the first
U.K. lender to woo customers with interest-free loans on credit
card balance transfers. The bank, established in 1998, gained
more than 1 million customers and had about 7.3 billion pounds
in deposits by 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
