The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Sao Paulo  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4:15 p.m. New York time.
Preferred shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index fell 0.5 percent to 59,970.54.  Cia. Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP6 BS) climbed 1.1 percent
to 33.40 reais. The power company known as Cesp may seek more
than 9 billion reais ($5.8 billion) from Brazil’s federal
government when its power concessions end in 2015,  Valor
Economico  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Mauro Arce.
Cesp claims it’s owed a tax rebate as well as funds for
investments that haven’t yet amortized, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said.  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  (GFSA3 BS) slumped 4.8 percent to 7.34 reais. The
homebuilder led declines by companies that depend on credit
growth after economists covering  Brazil  raised their 2012
inflation forecast in a central bank survey, leading traders to
raise bets for higher borrowing costs.  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  (GOLL4 BS) dropped 3.1
percent to 16.47 reais, and  Tam SA (TAMM4)  (TAMM4 BS) fell 1.5 percent
to 33.80 reais. Both airlines declined after Credit Suisse Group
AG said rising oil prices may reduce their profits.  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  (HYPE3 BS) tumbled 3.2 percent to 12.55
reais. The consumer-goods company fell after rival Natura
Cosmeticos SA reported lower-than-forecast profit, spurring
pessimism on the industry’s growth prospects. Natura said last
week second-quarter net income fell 1.8 percent to 188.1 million
reais, missing the average estimate of 212.8 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  (PETR4 BS) gained 2.3 percent to
23.50 reais. Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil company
is known, will raise as much as $91 billion in debt and sell up
to $13.6 billion of assets as part of its $224.7 billion
investment plan for 2011 through 2015, according to a regulatory
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
