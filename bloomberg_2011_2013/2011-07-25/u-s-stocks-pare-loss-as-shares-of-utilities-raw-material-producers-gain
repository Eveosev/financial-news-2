U.S. stocks trimmed losses as gains
in raw-material producers and utilities helped the market
recover part of an earlier slide triggered by concern lawmakers
will fail to agree on a budget compromise and avoid a government

1,337.50 at 10:14 a.m. after losing as much as 1 percent
earlier.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
