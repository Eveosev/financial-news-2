(Corrects dateline. Story first ran July 25.)  DuPont Co., the largest U.S.
chemical company by market value, bought Innovalight Inc. to
expand in the solar materials market.  DuPont had revenue of more than $1 billion in the solar
market in 2010, and expects that to reach $2 billion by 2014,
the Wilmington, Delaware-based company said today in a
statement. It did not give a price for the purchase.  Innovalight offers a silicon ink printing process that can
be incorporated into existing production lines for crystalline
silicon solar cells, according to the Sunnyvale, California-
based companyâ€™s website. The technology lets cell manufacturers
reach conversion efficiencies of as much as 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
