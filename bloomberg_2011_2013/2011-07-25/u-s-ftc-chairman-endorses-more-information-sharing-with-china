U.S. Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Jon Leibowitz said he hopes to increase information
sharing with Chinese government agencies in regard to cross-
border mergers and acquisitions.  “I don’t think we are quite there yet in terms of sharing
information,” Leibowitz told reporters in Beijing today. “We
hope that that is a goal going forward and more than just a
distant aspiration. I think it’s something that can be
accomplished in the next few years.”  Leibowitz, who arrived in the Chinese capital yesterday, is
in Beijing to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on Antitrust
and Antimonopoly Cooperation between the  U.S. Department of
Justice  and the FTC and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, the
National Development and Reform Commission and the State
Administration for Industry & Commerce.  --Regina Tan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
