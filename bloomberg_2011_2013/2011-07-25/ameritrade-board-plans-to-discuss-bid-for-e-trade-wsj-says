The board of  TD Ameritrade Holding
Corp. (AMTD)  plans to discuss a possible bid for rival online brokerage
E*Trade Financial Corp., the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar with the matter.  The board’s planned discussions tomorrow don’t necessarily
mean a formal bid will be made, the newspaper added.  Kim Hillyer, a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade, didn’t
immediately respond to telephone or e-mail messages requesting
comment on the newspaper’s report of a meeting. Kristin Petrick,
a spokeswoman for the company, declined last week to comment on
deal speculation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
