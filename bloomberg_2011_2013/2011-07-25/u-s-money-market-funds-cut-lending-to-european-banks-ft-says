U.S. money-market funds have stopped
all but very short-term lending to European banks in recent
weeks as concern about sovereign debt has mounted, the Financial
Times reported, citing figures from Fitch, the rating company.  Spanish and Italian banks accounted for 0.8 percent of the
$1.57 trillion of assets in prime money-market funds at the end
of June, down from 6.1 percent late in 2009, the newspaper said.  The 10 biggest U.S. prime money-market funds cut lending to
European banks by 8.7 percent on a dollar basis in the course of
the month, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
