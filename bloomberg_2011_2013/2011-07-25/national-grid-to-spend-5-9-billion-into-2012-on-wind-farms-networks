National Grid Plc (NG/) , operator of the
U.K.’s power and natural gas networks, will spend 3.6 billion
pounds ($5.9 billion) in the year to March 2012 to connect
offshore wind farms and replace networks.  The U.K. will account for almost 65 percent of capital
expenditure for the year, the London-based company said in a
statement today.  The utility has signed an additional 1,000 megawatts of
offshore wind and 1,400 megawatts of Norwegian inter-connection
agreements over the past three months. A review of U.S.
operations, which led to it slashing 1,150 jobs earlier this
year, has been completed and the company is “on track” to
achieve $200 million of annualized savings, National Grid said.  “In the U.S., our focus remains on working towards
improved returns through enhanced customer service and operating
efficiencies,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Holliday said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
