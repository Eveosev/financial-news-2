Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators dropped for a fourth day as
shipments to the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes region declined.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 2.8 percent to 20.5 million
dekatherms (19.9 billion cubic feet) from 21 million yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Schedules for 689 of
742 pipelines had been reported as of 3:40 p.m. New York time.  Scheduled shipments to power generators in the mid-Atlantic
and Great Lakes region dropped 12 percent to 2.59 million
dekatherms, according to reports from 66 of 79 pipelines in the
region.  Power plants use about 30 percent of the nationâ€™s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Wholesale gas for next-day delivery at the Chicago City
Gate, supplying Chicago utilities including Nicor and Peoples
Gas Light & Coke, fell 3.4 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $4.5175 per
million British thermal units as of 1:50 p.m. New York time on
the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 1.21 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $4.449 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
