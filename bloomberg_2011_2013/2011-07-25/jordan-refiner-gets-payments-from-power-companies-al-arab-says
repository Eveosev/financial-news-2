Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co. (JOPT) 
received 165.5 million dinars ($233 million) owed by several
power companies, Al Arab Al Yawm reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Abdul Kareem Alaween.  The kingdomâ€™s only refinery near Amman hopes more debts
will be settled in order to help pay outstanding dues to
importers of crude and oil products, Alaween said, according to
the newspaper.  The refiner said June 23 it may have to stop importing fuel
unless it starts receiving 633 million dinars owed by the
Jordanian government and power companies. The plant has capacity
of 90,400 barrels a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
