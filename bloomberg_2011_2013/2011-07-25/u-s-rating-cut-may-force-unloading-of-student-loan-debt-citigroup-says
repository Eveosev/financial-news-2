A cut in the U.S. government’s AAA
grade could force investors to sell asset-backed securities tied
to  student loans , causing spreads to widen “significantly,”
according to Citigroup Inc.  “A ratings downgrade would be a significant blow” to the
$250 billion government-guaranteed sector, Citigroup analysts
led by Mary Kane said in a July 22 report. “The likelihood of
forced selling is elevated.”  Citigroup sees a 50 percent chance of a ratings cut this
year as the U.S. struggles to reduce its long-term debt. Many
investors buy student-loan securities specifically because
they’re so highly rated and a U.S. government credit risk,
according to analysts at the New York-based lender. Money
managers with rating-based guidelines would be forced to sell
into a sinking market, affecting the sector more than other
asset-backed debt tied to consumers, commercial mortgages and
corporate loans, they wrote.  Securities linked to student borrowings yield 170 basis
points, or 1.7 percentage points, more than Treasuries,
according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The spread
has narrowed from 186 basis points since Dec. 31.  Citigroup considers it highly probable that President
 Barack Obama  and Congress will reach a deal to raise the debt
ceiling by Aug. 2 that doesn’t adequately address the long-term
fiscal situation. It’s less likely that the U.S. will breach the
ceiling and default on its debt, which would have a “massive
impact on numerous markets,” analysts Brett Rose and Siddharth Joshi wrote in the same report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
