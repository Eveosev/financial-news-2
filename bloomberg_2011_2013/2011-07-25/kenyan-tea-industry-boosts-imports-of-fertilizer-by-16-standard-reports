The Kenya Tea Development Agency
will import 65,000 metric tons of fertilizer this year, a 16
percent increase from 2010, The Standard reported.  The higher amount is being purchased because more farmers
have elected to import their fertilizer via the authority, the
Nairobi-based newspaper said. The chemicals were bought from
Azumores SA, a Romanian company, it said.  The first consignment of 31,000 tons arrived at the port of
 Mombasa  on July 22 and the rest will arrive in mid-August, the
newspaper said.  Kenya is the worldâ€™s largest exporter of black tea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
