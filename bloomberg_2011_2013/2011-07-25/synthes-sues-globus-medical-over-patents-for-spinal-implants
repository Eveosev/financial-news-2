Synthes Inc. (SYST) , being bought by
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  for $21.3 billion, sued a competing maker of
spinal-repair products, Globus Medical Inc., alleging
infringement of three U.S. patents.  Synthes, a Swiss company based in  West Chester ,
Pennsylvania, contends Globus’ Independence, Coalition and
InterContinental Plate-spacer systems are using the protected
technology.  The company “has suffered and will continue to suffer
damages and irreparable injuries” unless a court stops the
Globus infringement, Synthes lawyers said in papers filed July
22 in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Globus is
based in Audubon, Pennsylvania.  Johnson & Johnson agreed in April to buy Synthes in the
biggest purchase of the company’s 125-year history, to become
the leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices that treat
trauma victims.  Synthes has 50 percent of the market for sales of screws,
plates, bone grafts and other products to treat skeletal damage,
according to Navid Malik, an analyst with Matrix Corporate
Capital LLP.  Edward Joyce, a spokesman for Globus, didn’t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the suit.  The case is Synthes USA v. Globus Medical Inc., 11-cv-652,
U.S. District Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
