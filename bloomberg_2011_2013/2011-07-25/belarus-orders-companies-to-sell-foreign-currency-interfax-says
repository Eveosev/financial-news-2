(Correct story originally published July 25 to reflect
changes in scope of exemption made by Interfax.)  Belarusian President  Alexander Lukashenko  signed an order requiring more companies to convert
foreign-currency revenue into rubles, Interfax reported today,
citing a statement from the president’s press service.  Companies including oil refiners, which are deemed
strategic, had been exempted from a rule forcing companies to
convert 30 percent of their foreign-currency revenue into
rubles, the news service reported.  “Given the situation on the domestic  currency market , as
well as the goal of creating equal conditions for businesses,
the exceptions for the mandatory sale of foreign currency that
were in place until now have been canceled,” Interfax cited the
statement as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
