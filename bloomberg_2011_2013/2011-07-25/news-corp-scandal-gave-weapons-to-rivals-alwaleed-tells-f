Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM) ’s Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud said the phone hacking scandal at
 News Corp. (NWSA)  “gave weapons to competitors who created a
hysteria,” the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  News Corp. shareholders shouldn’t “cry wolf now” about
the company’s dual share structure that gives the family of
Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch almost 40 percent of
voting rights, Alwaleed also said, according to the FT.  News Corp. shares won’t suffer a “Murdoch discount,”
Alwaleed said in the interview, adding Rupert Murdoch, Chief
Operating Officer Chase Carey and Deputy Chief Operating Officer
James Murdoch, “know what they are doing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
