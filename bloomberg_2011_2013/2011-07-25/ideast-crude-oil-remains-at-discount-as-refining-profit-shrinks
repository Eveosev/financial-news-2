Middle East crude-oil grades for
sale to  Asia  stayed at a discount to benchmark prices amid signs
that refinery profits are falling.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., was
unchanged at a discount of 18 cents a barrel to its official
selling price for September loading, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg News. Upper Zakum, also produced in the emirate,
was at a discount of 23 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data show.  Demand for crude may be slowing as refiners’ processing
profits decline. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai, a measure of
profitability, shrank 4.1 percent from a week ago to $18.38 a
barrel today, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker.  Oman crude for immediate loading was little changed at
$112.16 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for delivery
in September was little changed at $111.65. Murban was unchanged
at $115.85.  Oman futures for September delivery fell 82 cents to
$112.38 a barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 6:45 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,967 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $112.31 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which
measures the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf
grade, fell 0.2 percent to $5.47 a barrel, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates. The exchange for swaps for October fell
5 cents to $5.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
