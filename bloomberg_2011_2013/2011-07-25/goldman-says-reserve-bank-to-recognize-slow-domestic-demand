Tushar Poddar and Vishal Vaibhaw,
Mumbai-based economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., comment on
 India ’s monetary policy in a report released today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change.  “We think the RBI’s language will still have a hawkish
bias, but will importantly recognize that domestic demand,
particularly investment demand, has slowed considerably, and
that there are headwinds to growth from the global environment.  “We continue to expect the RBI to hike by another 25 basis
points after July 26 in the remainder of 2011, with the next
hike likely by October...Inflation and inflation expectations
remain at levels so far above the RBI’s preferred target that
the central bank would want to err on the side of having done
too much rather than too little in its fight against
inflation.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
