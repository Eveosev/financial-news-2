Russian fertilizer maker Fosagro is
considering an offer from Belarus state oil company Belneftekhim
to buy a stake in its Gomel factory, Vedomosti reported, citing
the Russian company.  Gomel, the only producer of phosphate fertilizers in
Belarus, is difficult to value because of a lack of detailed
information about its operations, the Moscow-based newspaper
reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
