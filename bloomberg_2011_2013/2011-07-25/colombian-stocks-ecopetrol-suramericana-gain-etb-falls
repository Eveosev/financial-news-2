The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.4 percent to 13,878.85, while the
Colcap Index gained 0.6 percent to 1,655.68.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , the Colombian state-owned  oil
company , rose 1.8 percent to 3,770 pesos. The company said it
will sell 676 million shares at 3,700 pesos per share as it aims
to fund investments to double production.  “The price of the offering was so close to today’s opening
price that some investors have begun buying in the secondary
market to make sure they get the shares they want,” said
Valeria Marconi, an analyst at Correval SA. “In addition, the
size of the offering is much smaller than many had expected.”  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving  Colombia ’s capital, fell to a three-month
low after a Bogota city council commission unanimously rejected
allowing for the sale of part or all of the city’s 87 percent
stake. ETB fell 4.4 percent to 590 pesos.  Grupo de Inversiones Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR)  , the
parent company of Colombia’s largest bank, rose 1.6 percent to
36,000 pesos. ING Groep NV agreed to sell most of its Latin
American insurance operations to Grupo de Inversiones
Suramericana for about 2.7 billion euros ($3.9 billion).  “Investors may be betting on the long-term benefits of the
acquisition,” Marconi said. “It’s a strategic move.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
