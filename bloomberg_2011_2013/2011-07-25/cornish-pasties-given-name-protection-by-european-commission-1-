Cornish pasties have been
safeguarded against imitations by the European Commission now
that they’ve been added to the so-called protected geographic
indications database, the EC said.  Cornish pasties must be made in Cornwall, on the
southwestern tip of the U.K., shaped like a capital ‘D’ and
crimped on one side, “never on the top,” according to the
 Cornish Pasty Association’s website . The filling must have mince
or chunks of beef, swede, potato, onion and peppery seasoning,
according to the website.  “In terms of the PGI status, this is fantastic news for
Cornwall from a business point of view,” Mark Muncey, chairman
of the association, said by telephone today. “Cornish pasty
manufacturers won’t have the pasty devalued. It’s a specific
recipe that will be upheld so it’s a positive move for us, not
unlike Champagne or Parma ham.”  Cornish pasties’ addition to the database was known about
in February so today’s announcement by the EC was “purely a
rubber-stamp exercise,” Muncey said. The CPA submitted an
application for the status in 2002, according to its website.  “It is believed locally that protection of the Cornish
pasty is necessary in order to safeguard the heritage of the
Cornish pasty, the future of the industry and the reputation of
the product,” according to the CPA website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
