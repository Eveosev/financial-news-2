Canada ’s dollar traded at almost the
strongest level since November 2007 as investors sought shelter
after U.S. lawmakers failed to find consensus on raising the
nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  The Canadian currency capped a second-straight weekly gain
on July 22 on speculation the nation’s central bank will raise
 interest rates  at least once this year. The currency was the
fourth-best performer this month among its 16 most-traded
counterparts before a report this week that’s forecast to show
Canada’s economy grew at a faster pace in May than April.  “There’s room for the Canadian economy to continue with a
relatively strong degree of positive momentum, economically
speaking, while we’re dealing with all the sovereign-debt
distress in the developed world,”  Stephen Gallo , head of market
analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange, said by phone from
 London . “I’d be very surprised if a portion of the recent
strength we’ve seen in the Canadian dollar weren’t related to
safe-haven flows.”  The Canadian currency gained as much as 0.5 percent to
94.35 cents per  U.S. dollar , and closed at 94.72 cents at 5 p.m.
in Toronto, compared with 94.80 cents on July 22, the day after
it reached 94.23 cents, the strongest since Nov. 9, 2007. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0574.  U.S. Republicans prepared to force action on a shorter-term
extension of the debt limit than President Barack Obama has
requested.  Deadline for U.S.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  has said the U.S.
will run out of options to prevent a default on Aug. 2 unless
the debt ceiling is increased. The impasse has boosted the
chance  Standard & Poor’s  will cut the U.S. credit rating from
AAA within three months to 50 percent, the company reiterated on
July 21.  “The markets are coming to the realization that a
reduction in the U.S.’s credit status is going to have to be
priced in over time,” Gallo at Schneider said. “No matter what
happens with the debt-ceiling talks, this AAA rating that the
U.S. has is probably unjustified.”  The euro slid against the yen as Moody’s downgraded  Greece 
by three steps, saying the European rescue plan for the debt-
laden nation will amount to a default. The 17-nation currency
traded at 112.55 yen, down 0.2 percent.  Canada’s gross domestic product expanded 0.1 percent in May
from a month earlier, according to the median of 22 forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg News.  Statistics Canada  is due to report
the data on July 29 in Ottawa.  Canadian currency turnover rose to an average $61.2 billion
a day in April, an increase of 5.9 percent from October,
according to a semi-annual survey of trading published by the
Canadian Foreign Exchange Committee.  Government bonds  were little changed, with the yield on
benchmark 10-year debt up less than one basis point at 2.93
percent as the price of the 3.25 percent security maturing in
June 2021 gained half a cent on the dollar to C$102.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
