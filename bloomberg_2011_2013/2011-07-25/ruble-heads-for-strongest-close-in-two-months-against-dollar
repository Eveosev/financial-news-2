The ruble rose against the dollar,
headed for the strongest closing level in more than two months.  Russia’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 27.71 per
dollar as of 3:10 p.m. in Moscow, making it the best performer
of more than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
A close at that level would be the strongest since May 11. The
ruble was 0.3 percent stronger at 39.80 per euro, leaving it 0.2
percent stronger at 33.1478 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Russian  government bonds  were little changed, leaving the
yield on the ruble Eurobond due in 2018 steady at 6.834 percent.
Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations
of currency movements and allow companies to hedge against them,
show the ruble at 27.982 per dollar in three months, compared
with 28.053 July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
