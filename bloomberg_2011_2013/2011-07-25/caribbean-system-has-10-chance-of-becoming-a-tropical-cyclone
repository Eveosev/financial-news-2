A tropical wave over Cuba and
adjacent waters has a near “zero” percent chance of developing
into a tropical cyclone within 48 hours compared with 10 percent
in the previous forecast, the National Hurricane Center said.  “Significant development of this system is not expected
during the next couple of days” as it moves generally westward
at almost 20 miles (32 kilometers) per hour and interacts with
land, the Miami-based center said today in a website  advisory  at
8 a.m. New York time.  No tropical cyclone formation is expected in the eastern
Pacific within the next two days, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
