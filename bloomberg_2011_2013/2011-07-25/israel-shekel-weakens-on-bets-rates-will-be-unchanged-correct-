The shekel retreated for the first
time in five days on bets the Bank of  Israel  will leave its
benchmark lending rate unchanged today.  The shekel weakened as much as 0.8 percent against the
dollar and was 0.2 percent lower at 3.4029 at 4:21 p.m. in  Tel
Aviv . Two-year interest-rate swaps, a gauge of the average
short-term rates in the next two years, fell for the first time
in a week dropping to 3.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data.  Near-zero interest rates in the U.S. spurred inflows into
Israel and other countries where borrowing costs are higher,
driving gains in currencies. The shekel has strengthened 3.8
percent against the dollar this year. The Fed-funds rate has
been at zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  “Investors are selling shekels today ahead of the
 interest-rate  decision and bets the rate differential with the
U.S. may not widen,” Yaron Chechik, a trader at Financial
Immunities Ltd. in Rehovot, Israel, said by telephone. “The
shekel is also suffering as the euro-zone turmoil and the U.S.
deficit worries are boosting demand for the safest assets.”  U.S. lawmakers failed to agree on raising the nation’s
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling and  Greece ’s credit rating was cut
further by Moody’s Investors Service.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  will hold the
benchmark interest rate for a second month, according to 17 of
18 economists in a Bloomberg survey. One predicts a 25 basis-
point increase to 3.5 percent. The central bank will announce
its decision at 5:30 p.m.  Bond Auction  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 slipped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5
percent. The yield on the  Bank of Israel ’s Makam bill due
December 2011 jumped five basis points to 3.31 percent, the
highest level this month.  The country’s Ministry of Finance raised 1.1 billion
shekels ($323 million) at debt auctions today, including 200
million shekels of notes due August 2016 with a 4.25 percent
coupon and 200 million shekels of bonds maturing in January 2022
with a 5.5 percent coupon.  “Demand was low at the auction as  government bonds  are
fully priced in the market,” Assaf Rosenberg, a trader at
Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in  Ramat Gan , Israel,
said by telephone. “Investors are sitting on the fence waiting
for the interest rate decision later today and are hesitant to
take positions because of concern about the U.S. deficit.”  Debt Plan  The government also sold 200 million shekels of 2.75
percent inflation-linked bonds maturing in September 2022, 200
million shekels of 2.75 percent inflation-linked bonds due
August 2041 and 300 million shekels of 176-day bills. The
auctions bring sales this month to 3.9 billion shekels.  Delek Real Estate Ltd. (DLKR) ’s board approved a plan to help pay
off debt, which includes asking holders of the company’s Series
25 bonds to agree to delayed principal payments in exchange for
additional interest.  The 7.3 percent Delek Real Estate bond due September 2012
fell, pushing the yield up 10 percentage points to 47.3 percent,
the highest since January 2009. The Tel-Bond 40 Index of
corporate bonds rose less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
