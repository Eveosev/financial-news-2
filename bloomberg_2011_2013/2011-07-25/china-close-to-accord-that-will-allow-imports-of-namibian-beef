China  is close to an accord that
will clear the way for it to import beef from  Namibia , its
ambassador to the southern African nation said.  “As our governments have agreed on the content of the
Animal Heath and Quarantine Agreement, Namibia’s agricultural
and livestock products are likely to enter the Chinese market in
the foreseeable future,” Wei Ruixing told a Namibia-China
business forum in the capital, Windhoek, today.  Trade between the two countries was $713 million last year,
60 times more than in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
