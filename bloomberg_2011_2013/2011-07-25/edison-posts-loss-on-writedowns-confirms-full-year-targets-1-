Edison SpA (EDN) ,  Italy ’s second-largest
power producer, said 2011 targets are unchanged even as it
posted a first-half loss due to writedowns related to its Greek
and Croatian assets.  The Milan-based company had a net loss of 62 million euros
($89 million) compared with a profit of 142 million euros a year
earlier, according to a stock exchange statement. Edison said
the recent renegotiation of gas procurement contracts with
Promgas will allow the company to confirm its target for 2011
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
900 million euros.  High gas prices will continue to hurt profit until ongoing
negotiations for other contracts are concluded, the company said
in the statement. Edison’s goal is to secure “reasonable
margins on its gas contracts and lump-sum compensation payments
for past years.”  Edison is in the process of renegotiating gas contracts,
signed when  oil prices  were higher that force the power producer
to pay more for the fuel than it can sell it for. Chief
Financial Officer Marco Andreasi said today an agreement with
Promgas on the supply of gas from  Russia  will boost third-
quarter earnings by 118 million euros.  Sales increased 11 percent in the first half to 5.66
billion euros, while Ebitda declined 22 percent to 491 million
euros. Net debt as of June 30 was 3.87 billion euros, up from
3.71 billion euros at the end of 2010. Edison confirmed its debt
target of 3.9 billion euros at the end of this year, Andreasi
said today during a conference call with analysts.  The shares slid 3.4 percent to 87 euro cents at 3:58 p.m.
local time, the biggest decline since July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
