Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
second day as companies bought dollars in preparation for using
diesel generators following plans to ration power supply.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy weakened 0.2
percent to 90.40 per dollar at 1:07 p.m. in Nairobi, from a
close of 90.25 on July 22.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased demand for the
greenback by businesses to buy  diesel fuel  for power generation
following the decision to start power cuts,” Wilson Mutai, a
trader at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview today.  Kenya Power Ltd., the East African country’s sole
electricity distributor, said it will begin scheduled power cuts
on July 27 due to limited supply, after rainfall in the three
months through May was “highly depressed and poorly
distributed,” curbing hydropower output.  Kenya’s central bank said it would offer 19 billion
shillings ($210 million) of seven-day reverse-repurchase
agreements to add liquidity to the market. The securities will
be offered at 6.25 percent, said a central bank official who
declined to be identified in line with the Nairobi-based bank’s
policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
