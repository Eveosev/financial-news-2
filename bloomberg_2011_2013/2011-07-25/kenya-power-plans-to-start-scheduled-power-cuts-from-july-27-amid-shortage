Kenya  Power Ltd., the East African
country’s sole electricity distributor, said it will begin
scheduled power cuts on July 27 due to limited supply.  “There has been insufficient power generation reserve
margin to meet the ever rising national power demand,” the
company said in a statement in the Nairobi-based  Daily Nation .  Power supply in east Africa’s biggest economy is expected
to improve in the next two to three months when an emergency
power plant of 60 megawatts is installed in Muhoroni, western
Kenya, the statement said.  Kenya plans to spend as much as $50 billion over the next
20 years to cope with a 13.5 percent annual growth in
electricity demand, the Energy Regulatory Commission said July
19. Electricity demand is forecast to reach 16,905 megawatts by
2031 from 1,520 megawatts next year, Frederick Nyang, director
of economic regulation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
