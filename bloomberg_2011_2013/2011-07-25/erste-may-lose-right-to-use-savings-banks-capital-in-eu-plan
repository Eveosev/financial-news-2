Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  may have to
abandon using affiliated savings banks to bolster its reserves
under the European Union’s proposed implementation of global
capital rules.  The EU’s proposals don’t give Erste the leeway it would
need for the capital to be recognized, spokesman Michael Mauritz
said on the telephone from Vienna. Austria’s biggest lender will
seek to lobby lawmakers at the European Parliament for an
exemption for Erste, he said.  Erste in 2002 reached a deal with 51 regional savings banks
to guarantee each other’s deposits. While Erste has little or no
stake in the savings banks, the system gives the Vienna-based
lender powers over them. Erste is counting the assets and the
capital of the banks toward its reserves.  The EU plans are based on a global accord among members of
the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision . The Basel deal would
lead to Erste’s capital ratio dropping about 1.3 percentage
points, the lender said last year.  The bank will seek to avoid the capital reduction by making
tweaks to the guarantee system if it can’t convince the EU to
change its proposals, Mauritz said.  “We have to see whether this capital will be considered in
the negotiations” in the EU, “and if it’s not, we’ll have to
make changes in the contract,” Mauritz said.  Erste is scheduled to report second-quarter results on July
29. Its core tier 1 capital excluding state aid stood at 8
percent at the end of the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
