Air France-KLM (AF)  Group plans to buy a
minority stake in Ivory Coast’s national airline, Air Ivoire,
Chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta said in an interview on Abidjan-
based broadcaster TCI.  “President  Alassane Ouattara  has trusted us with
relaunching the company Air Ivoire as soon as possible, by the
end of this year or early next year,” he said in the interview
that took place at the West African nation’s presidential
palace.  The government will have a majority share in the airline
when it restarts, Transport Minister Gaoussou Toure said on TCI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
