The Obama administration said it
will increase efforts to thwart the growing political and
economic power of organized criminal groups engaged in bribery,
drug and human trafficking, and the theft of company secrets.  President Barack Obama yesterday issued an executive order
to freeze property and other assets owned by international
criminal organizations and give immigration officials more
authority to keep suspected members out of the U.S., according
to a fact sheet on the administration’s strategy.  “Criminal networks are not only expanding their
operations, but they are also diversifying their activities,
resulting in a convergence of transnational threats that has
evolved to become more complex, volatile and destabilizing,”
Obama wrote in the introduction of the 28-page strategy released
today.  The crime groups are deepening their influence in
governments around the world by paying $1 trillion in bribes
annually and in some cases competing with governments to provide
services such as security, according to the administration’s
fact sheet.  Criminal organizations increasingly are working with
terrorists, the administration said. Twenty-nine of the top 63
drug traffickers had links to terror groups, according to
Justice Department statistics from fiscal year 2010.  Break ‘Backbone’  In the executive order, Obama specified four criminal
groups whose assets are among the initial targets of its
sanctions: the Yakuza of  Japan , Los Zetas of Mexico, Camorra of
 Italy  and the Brothers’ Circle of  Russia .  The new strategy is an attempt “to improve our ability to
break the financial backbone” of organized crime, Attorney
General Eric Holder said at a news conference in  Washington .  As part of the strategy, the administration has pledged to
strengthen investigations and prosecutions of organized
criminals and foster more cooperation with foreign governments.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
