Ukraineâ€™s grain exports declined in
the last week after the country started taxing outbound
shipments earlier this month, researcher APK-Inform said.  Grain exports were 84,300 metric tons from July 18 through
July 24, compared with 244,300 tons in the same period a year
earlier, the Dnipropetrovsk-based researcher said in a statement
on its website today.  Shipments declined after the government introduced export
duties and the government canceled the reimbursement of value
added tax to grain exporters, APK-Inform said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
