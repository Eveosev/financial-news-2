Most stocks on the Bovespa index
declined as traders boosted bets  Brazil  will increase borrowing
costs, and U.S. leaders failed to reach a deal to raise the
country’s debt ceiling.  The Bovespa fell 0.2 percent to 60,160 at 12:17 p.m. New
York time. The real strengthened 0.7 percent to 1.5406 per  U.S.
dollar . Forty stocks on the benchmark equity gauge declined,
while 25 gained. The Bovespa has fallen 18 percent from a
November high on concern that rising inflation may hurt domestic
demand, while a slowdown in global economic growth could dampen
the need for commodities.  “Brazil has really had the worst of both worlds since
November, where it trades off on global macro news, the
idiosyncratic problems it’s facing, coupled with this inflation
problem,” said Frederick Searby,  Latin America  equity
strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. “These global issues, in tandem
with Brazil’s own domestic issues, haven’t been good for
Brazilian equities.”  Braskem SA, Latin America’s largest petrochemicals
producer, led decliners as commodity exporters fell on concern
that unless the U.S. reaches an agreement on how to tackle its
$14.3 trillion debt by Aug. 2, the country could default. OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, the  oil company  controlled by
billionaire  Eike Batista , followed crude lower.  Lojas Americanas SA, the country’s biggest discount
retailer, led declines by companies that depend on domestic
demand. Petroleo Brasileiro SA gained after Brazil’s state-
controlled oil company said it will raise as much as $91 billion
in debt and sell assets of up to $13.6 billion as part of its
2011-2015 spending plan.  Interest Rates   Traders are betting that the central bank will raise
Brazil’s benchmark rate after a survey of about 100 economists
forecast that policy makers will increase borrowing costs to
12.75 percent by the end of 2012, according to a survey
published today. The bank increased the Selic rate on July 20 in
an effort to contain inflation running at a six-year high.  U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  plans to press ahead with a
two-step debt-limit extension that President Barack Obama has
threatened to veto, fueling concern the nation is lurching
toward a default as early as Aug. 2 and jeopardizing its AAA
credit rating.  Greece ’s credit rating was cut three steps by
Moody’s Investors Service, which said the European Union’s
rescue for the nation will cause “substantial” losses for
investors.  Braskem, Lojas Americanas  Braskem retreated 2.6 percent to 19.96 reais, and OGX fell
1.9 percent to 13.67 reais. Lojas Americanas retreated 1.1
percent to 13.82 reais. Petrobras rose 2.4 percent to 23.53
reais.  The Bovespa trades at 9.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, the lowest since March 2009, according to weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a ratio of 12.4 for the
Shanghai Composite Index, 6.7 for  Russia ’s Micex and 15.1 for
 India ’s Sensex.  Traders moved 4.83 billion reais ($3.11 billion) in stocks
on July 22, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a
daily average this year of 6.39 billion reais through July 21,
according to data from the exchange.  Foreign investors have pulled 171.8 million reais from
Latin America’s largest equity market in the year through July
20, according to the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
