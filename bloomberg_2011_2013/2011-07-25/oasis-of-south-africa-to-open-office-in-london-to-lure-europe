Oasis Group Holdings Ltd., a South
African  fund manager  controlling the equivalent of 30 billion
rand ($4.4 billion), plans to open an office in  London  as it
expands outside its home market.  The Cape Town-based company, which also has an office in
Dublin, aims to attract investments from institutional investors
in the U.K. and  Europe , Adam Ebrahim, founder and chief
investment officer of Oasis, said in an interview. Oasis plans
to start with two people in its London office, he said.  “Initially we will be dealing on the institutional side
and then we’ll expand over time,” Ebrahim said. “There are a
lot of international clients that pass through the U.K. It
shortens the distance and time span to your clients.”  Oasis, which offers conventional asset funds as well as
funds that adhere to Islamic principles, was  South Africa ’s
best-performing bond fund-manager in 2010 in terms of annual
returns, according to an  I-Net Bridge survey . A family-owned
business, Oasis started in 1997 and had 1 billion rand under
management five years later. It now employs 180 people,
including six in its Dublin office.  The company started a global property fund in 2006 and also
manages a global equity fund. It obtained an insurance license
in 2010, enabling it to sell retirement annuities and endowment
policies, Ebrahim said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
