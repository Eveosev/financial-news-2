Su Sian Lim, a Singapore-based
strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, comments on the
outlook for the  Singapore dollar  in a telephone interview today.  Inflation accelerated to 5.2 percent in June, the fastest
pace since January, as food and housing costs rose, the
government reported today.  The bank predicts the local currency will strengthen 2.4
percent to S$1.18 per dollar by year-end and 4.1 percent to
S$1.16 in 12 months.  “I am still of the view that it remains too early to rule
out further tightening by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in
October. It’s always a toss out between inflation and growth. I
think the central bank is more concerned about inflation than
about growth. That balance hasn’t tilted yet.  “If we don’t get that unexpected scenario of a hard
landing, then there’s no reason why the MAS will stop at what it
is doing. It is going to be business as usual in terms of
allowing the Singapore dollar to continue to appreciate to bring
inflation under control.  “I would say that the outlook is still strong and my full-
year growth forecast of 6.1 percent is still very much intact.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
