Indonesia ’s rupiah strengthened for
a second day after international investors boosted holdings of
the nation’s assets to benefit from growth in Southeast Asia’s
biggest economy.  Global funds bought $69 million more Indonesian equities
than they sold last week, exchange data show. The currency has
advanced 0.6 percent this month after the  International Monetary
Fund  said on July 21 Indonesia’s gross domestic product will
rise about 6.5 percent in 2011-2012, after increasing 6.1
percent last year. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback
against the currencies of major trading partners, fell as
President  Barack Obama  and Congress failed to reach a deal on
raising the U.S. debt limit.  “Capital inflows into Indonesia are strong because of the
country’s stable economic fundamentals,” said Lindawati Susanto,
head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “The
dollar’s weakness is also supporting the rupiah’s gain.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.1 percent to 8,523 per dollar as
of 4:43 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency “may trade in a range of 8,520 to 8,540 today,”
Susanto said.  Overseas ownership  of Indonesian  government bonds  rose 24.4
percent to 243.53 trillion rupiah ($28.6 billion) this year
through July 21, according to latest figures from the debt-
management office.  The yield on Indonesia’s 8.25 percent bonds due July 2021
climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.23
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
