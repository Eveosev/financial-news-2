Turkish stocks extended the longest
losing streak since Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008
on concern the central bank isn’t doing enough to stop expansion
of the current-account deficit and a collapse in the currency.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  dropped 1.6 percent to
58,851.31 at 10:30 a.m. in Istanbul, falling for the eighth day.
It was the lowest level since March 2. The lira fell 1.77
percent to 1.7277 per dollar.  “Bids and offers on stocks have just disappeared,” Isik Okte, a trader at Istanbul-based broker Finans Invest, said in
response to e-mailed comments. “People are afraid the currency
is getting out of hand as the central bank lost control of the
situation.”  The central bank has kept  interest rates  at a record low of
6.25 percent as the current account deficit expanded to record
highs, reaching $68.2 billion in the 12 months to May. The lira
has been the worst-performing among 178 currencies in the world
over the previous five days.  Even local retailers who would normally sell dollars in a
spike “are not selling it this time,” Eren Yardimci, a
currency trader at UBS AG in Zurich, said in response to e-
mailed questions. “It is all one-way action here. There are no
sellers,” he said.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the bank that’s the largest
company on the exchange, lost 1.4 percent to 6.9 liras, leading
declines.  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS dropped 1.3 percent to 4.63
liras, and  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  fell 1.4 percent to 6.88 liras.  Emlak Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (EKGYO) , the country’s
largest real estate investment trust, fell 2.4 percent to 2.41
liras, a third day of declines, as it headed for the lowest
since March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
