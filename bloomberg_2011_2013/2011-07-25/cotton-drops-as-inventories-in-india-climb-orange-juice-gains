Cotton fell to the lowest price in a
week on signs that supplies are increasing in  India , the world’s
second-largest producer, as global demand slackens. Orange-juice
futures rose.  A.B. Joshi, India’s textiles commissioner, said that cotton
inventories may total 5.25 million bales on Oct. 1, compared
with 2.75 million estimated in February. A bale in India is 375
pounds, or 170 kilograms. Prices have plunged 56 percent since
touching a record in March, as consumption slumped in  China , the
leading grower and importer.  “There hasn’t been any return of demand yet,” Chris Kramedjian, a risk-management consultant at FCStone Fibers &
Textiles, said in a telephone interview from Nashville,
 Tennessee . “Until we see a real turnaround, I’m not going to
expect a bottom to the market.”  Cotton for December delivery fell 1.88 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at 96.76 cents a pound at 2:44 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , after touching 95.13 cents, the lowest
since July 18, and is headed for the fourth straight monthly
drop, the longest slump since a July-through-October slide in
2008. The price touched a record $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.45
cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $1.9875 a pound on ICE. The
commodity has gained 36 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
