The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 3.5 basis points to 116 basis
points as of 8:23 a.m. in  Hong Kong , prices from Credit Agricole
CIB show. The gauge is on course for its first increase since
July 18, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 3 basis points to 119
basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The risk benchmark is set for its first increase since
July 12, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in privately negotiated
markets.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 3 basis points to
116 basis points as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Credit
Agricole .  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
