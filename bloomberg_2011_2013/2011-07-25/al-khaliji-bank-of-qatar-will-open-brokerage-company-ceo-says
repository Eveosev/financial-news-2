Al Khaliji (KCBK) , a Qatari-based bank,
plans to open a brokerage company after abandoning plans to
merge with International Bank of Qatar earlier this year, Chief
Executive Officer Robin McCall said.  The bank has obtained a license and plans to hire people to
manage the brokerage, he said at a press conference at the
company’s headquarters in the Qatari capital Doha.  Qatar said last year that local banks would be allowed to
open brokerage firms, and  Al Ahli Bank (ABQK) ’s broking unit will begin
operating this week, Chief Executive Officer Salah Murad said
yesterday.  Al Khaliji shares plunged the most in almost two years on
June 5, a day after the bank canceled its planned merger with
IBQ. The combination would have created Qatar’s fourth-largest
bank by assets.  The bank hopes to hire an adviser to help it obtain a
credit rating within six weeks and has held preliminary
discussions with rating firms including Fitch Group Inc. and
 Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , McCall said. The lender hasn’t decided when to
tap debt markets, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
