South Africa wants  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) ’s takeover of  Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM)  to be subject to
conditions that will increase the burden on the companies if
local manufacturers are hurt, Business Day reported.  The government wants to ensure the conditions allowing the
deal approved by the country’s anti-trust body are sufficient
and isn’t seeking to overturn the decision, the Johannesburg-
based newspaper cited Lionel October, the director-general of
the department of economic development, as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
