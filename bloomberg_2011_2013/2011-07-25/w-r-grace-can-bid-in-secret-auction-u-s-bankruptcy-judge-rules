W.R. Grace & Co., a bankrupt
specialty-chemical maker, won court permission to bid in a
secret auction to buy assets from another company and to
complete the purchase if it makes the highest offer.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Judith K. Fitzgerald said in court
papers filed July 22 that she planned to sign an order allowing
Grace to participate in the auction. Fitzgerald has sealed
details about the auction.  The proposed purchase would “significantly enhance Grace’s
business plan and growth strategy in coming years,” the company
said in papers filed last month in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
Wilmington, Delaware.  Grace is awaiting permission to leave bankruptcy from
higher-level courts after Fitzgerald approved the company’s
reorganization plan in January. Should it resolve all appeals
and win final approvals, Grace would pay creditors in full and
set up a trust to pay victims of asbestos-poisoning.  Grace, based in Columbia,  Maryland , was among companies
that filed multibillion-dollar bankruptcies in 2000 and 2001 in
an attempt to limit their financial exposure to hundreds of
thousands of asbestos lawsuits. Asbestos particles can lodge
deep in the lungs, causing respiratory illnesses and cancer.  While in bankruptcy, the company has bought and sold
assets, each time seeking court permission.  The bankruptcy case is In re W.R. Grace, 01-1139, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
