Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , India’s biggest
wind-turbine maker, said it will get about 115 million pounds
($187 million) from the sale of its stake in  Hansen
Transmissions International NV (HSN)  to ZF Friedrichshafen AG.  Suzlon unit AE-Rotor Holding BV agreed to accept an offer
by ZF and will sell its entire 26.06 percent stake in Hansen,
which makes gears for wind turbines, the Indian company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  ZF, a German manufacturer of auto-parts and agricultural
machinery, will acquire Hansen for 444.8 million pounds in cash,
or 66 pence a share, according to an undertaking signed with
Hansen’s two largest shareholders, Suzlon Energy and London-
based investment company Ecofin Ltd., the German company said in
a statement today.  Suzlon, the world’s sixth-largest turbine maker, needs
funds to buy out minority stockholders that own 4.8 percent in
its German unit,  Repower Systems AG. (RPW)  The Indian company also
needs cash for next year, when loan repayments start and $389
million in convertible bonds mature.  Suzlon gained 2.7 percent to 54.40 rupees at 2:45 p.m. in
Mumbai trading, after climbing as much as 5.4 percent, the most
since May 31.  The company controlled by billionaire Tulsi Tanti raised
224 million pounds in November 2009 by selling a 35 percent
stake in Hansen to pare its $3.1 billion debt. The group’s total
debt as of December 2010 was 121 billion rupees ($2.7 billion),
the company said in an e-mail on April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
