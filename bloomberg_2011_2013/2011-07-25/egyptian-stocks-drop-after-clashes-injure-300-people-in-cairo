Egyptian stocks fell to the lowest
in more than a week  after clashes that erupted in central Cairo
between supporters and opponents of the ruling military council
injured more than 300 people.  The benchmark EGX 30 fell for the fifth day, declining 0.8
percent to 5093.74 at 12:10 p.m. in Cairo. Twenty one stocks
fell, two rose and seven were unchanged. The measure has
declined 29 percent this year following the popular revolt that
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak .  “I would say that the weekend events are affecting the
market negatively,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity sales
trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage.
“However it is not that bad as volumes are extremely low so
far. The low volumes are a sign of uncertainty from investors,
and show that there is no panic.”  Protesters used knives and swords in the clashes on July 23
and the army blocked the road leading to the defense ministry in
Cairo,  Al Jazeera  reported.  Al Arabiya  reported that one person
was killed and 308 injured during the protests. Egypt’s health
ministry later denied that anyone was killed.  Egyptian Prime Minister Essam Sharaf called on political
leaders and protesters to work on restoring order in the city,
according to a posting by Egypt’s Cabinet.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , the biggest publicly
traded builder in Egypt, declined 1.2 percent to 264.6 Egyptian
pounds.  Talaat Moustafa Group (TMGH)  Holding, the largest publicly
traded real-estate developer in Egypt, fell 1.1 percent to 4.39
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
