Housing starts in the U.S. will take
at least three years to return to the average level that
prevailed through 2004, assuming property values rise and
inventory of foreclosures shrinks, said researchers with the
 Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco .  “This is an optimistic scenario,” research associate
William Hedberg and senior economist John Krainer wrote in a
 paper released  by the bank today.  Allowing for a “soft landing” in prices, without a
decrease in the “shadow inventory” posed by foreclosures, “it
isn’t until after 2016 that housing starts return to their pre-
2005 average,” they said. “Something more than house price
appreciation is needed to lift housing starts back to normal
levels soon,” Hedberg and Krainer wrote.  Their latter conclusion was based on the assumption that
home values, after adjusting for inflation, depreciate at a
slower pace through 2012, stabilize in 2013 and begin to climb
in 2014.  “Our analysis suggests that even an unusually strong
period of real house price appreciation would not, on its own,
lift starts to long-run average levels,” they wrote. “A
significant easing of the drag on housing stemming from the
inventory of foreclosed homes is also needed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
