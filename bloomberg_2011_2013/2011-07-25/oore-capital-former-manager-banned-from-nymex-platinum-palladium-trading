A former  Moore Capital  Management LP
portfolio manager was barred from trading palladium and platinum
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as part of a settlement over
charges that he attempted to manipulate prices.  Christopher Louis Pia agreed to pay more than $1 million to
settle allegations of irregular trading from November 2007 and
May 2008, according to an order issued by the  Commodity Futures
Trading Commission .  Last year, Moore Capital, the $15 billion hedge fund run by
 Louis Bacon , agreed to pay $25 million to settle allegations by
the commission that a former portfolio manager, who was unnamed
then, attempted to manipulate platinum and palladium futures
during a surge in prices.  According to today’s order, the CFTC said Pia used buy
orders in the closing moments of trading on the Nymex to boost
settlement prices from November 2007 through May 2008. The
orders “frequently accounted for a significant portion of the
volume” in the two thinly traded markets, the regulator said.  “Christopher Pia is pleased to have settled with the CFTC
in order to put this matter behind him,” according to a
statement his company issued through a public relations firm,
ASC Advisors LLC. “Pia Capital, his current firm, is committed
to abiding by the CFTC order and to maintaining the highest
level of compliance.”  Platinum futures rose 39 percent from Nov. 1, 2007, to May
30, 2008, touching a record $2,308.80 an ounce on March 4, and
palladium jumped 17 percent. The metals are used in jewelry and
pollution-control components for cars.  Pia sought to influence the exchange’s volume-weighted
settlement price with buy orders for 20 to 100 contracts,
according to the agency. A platinum contract is 50 ounces, and a
palladium contract is 100 ounces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
