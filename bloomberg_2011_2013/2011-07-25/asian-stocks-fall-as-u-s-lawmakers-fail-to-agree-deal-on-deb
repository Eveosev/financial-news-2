Asian stocks fell, led by banks and
exporters, as U.S. lawmakers failed to reach an agreement to
raise the federal debt limit, increasing the prospect of a
default that may threaten the global recovery, and as Greece’s
credit rating was cut by Moody’s Investors Service.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker by market
value, slid 1.4 percent in Tokyo, leading consumer discretionary
stocks lower. Honda Motor Co., the Japanese automaker which
receives 44 percent of its revenue from North America, declined
1.6 percent.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s
biggest lender by market value, slipped 1.9 percent in Sydney.
 China  Railway Construction Corp. tumbled 6.7 percent in  Hong
Kong  to its lowest level on record after two high-speed trains
collided in China, killing at least 36 people.  “The ongoing saga of needing to raise the debt ceiling in
the U.S. is likely to remain a concern for stock markets as the
deadline heads closer with no apparent signs of agreement,”
said  Stephen Halmarick , Sydney-based head of investment markets
research at Colonial First State Global Asset Management, which
oversees about $150 billion. “If talks fail, we should expect a
credit-rating downgrade and another turn downwards in the  U.S.
economy .”  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index lost 0.9 percent 137.81 as of
6:29 p.m. in Tokyo. About three stocks fell for each that gained
on the gauge. The measure rose 2.5 percent last week, erasing
the regional benchmark index’s loss for the year, as steps by
European leaders toward easing the region’s sovereign debt
crisis, including fresh aid for  Greece , boosted the earnings
outlook for Asia’s banks and exporters.  Asian Benchmarks Fall  Most stock market benchmarks in the region fell today.
 Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.8 percent while South
Korea’s Kospi index declined 1 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index slipped 1.6 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slumped 0.7 percent, and
China’s  Shanghai  Composite index declined 3 percent, the biggest
decline among regional benchmarks, along with the Shenzhen
Composite Index, which dropped 3.8 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.9 percent
today. House Speaker John Boehner told Republicans that there’s
no agreement on a plan for raising the U.S. debt ceiling before
a default threatened for Aug. 2. A Republican congressional
official said Boehner, speaking by telephone to lawmakers, is
reporting that discussions are continuing. The impasse has
boosted the chance S&P Ratings Service will cut the U.S. credit
rating from AAA within three months to 50 percent, the company
said July 21.  Exporters Decline  Asian exporters to the U.S. declined on concern failure to
reach an agreement on debt talks may damp the economic recovery
and jeopardize their earnings prospects.  Toyota, which receives 28 percent of its sales from  North
America , slid 1.4 percent to 3,290 yen. Honda dropped 1.6
percent to 3,185 yen. Samsung Electronics Co., which counts
America as its second-biggest market for revenue, declined 0.4
percent to 847,000 won in  Seoul .  Asian banks also declined on concern credit rating agencies
may lower their outlook for U.S. debt, further roiling credit
markets. Both S&P and Moody’s Investors Service are weighing a
downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.  The amount of U.S. Treasuries held in Japan was estimated
at $912.4 billion at the end of May, the highest since at least
2000, according to U.S. Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.
China is the largest holder of U.S. debt, with $1.16 trillion at
the end of May, the data show.  ‘Mini Sell-Off’  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest listed
lender by market value, lost 2 percent to 399 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s No. 2, fell 1.3 percent to
2,497 yen. Commonwealth Bank of Australia declined 1.9 percent
to A$49.54 in Sydney.  “The outcome of U.S. debt talks was one of the big
concerns for investors, so this will trigger a mini sell-off in
stock markets,” said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the
equivalent of $1.7 billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. “Failure to reach a debt deal would jeopardize
the U.S.’s credit rating, and this has the potential to cause a
seizure in global credit markets.”  Greece’s Rating Cut  Stocks also fell as Moody’s Investors Service cut Greece’s
sovereign credit rating by three steps to Ca from Caa1, saying
the European Union’s financing package for the debt-laden nation
implies “substantial economic losses” for private creditors.  Esprit Holdings Ltd., the clothing retailer which counts
 Europe  as its biggest market, dropped 3.5 percent to HK$23.30 in
Hong Kong. Cosco Pacific Ltd., which operates container
facilities at Greece’s Piraeus port, slipped 0.3 percent to
HK$13.10. Trend Micro Inc., the internet security software maker
which receives 19 percent of its revenue from Europe, slid 2.1
percent to 2,521 yen in  Tokyo .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 1 percent this year
through July 22, compared with a gain of 7 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 1.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  China Rail Crash  Chinese railway-related companies fell after at least 36
people died and 200 were injured when a high-speed train that
broke down after being struck by lightning was rear-ended by
another locomotive two days ago in China, according to the
state-run Xinhua News Agency.  China Railway Construction sank 6.7 percent to HK$5.46, its
lowest level since listing in Hong Kong in March 2008.  China
Railway Group Ltd. (601390) , which builds railroads, plunged 6.7 percent
to HK$3.05. CSR Corp., which makes locomotives, freight wagons
and passenger carriages, tumbled 8.9 percent to 6.04 yuan in
Shanghai.  The accident will “substantially undermine” people’s
confidence in the country’s high-speed rail network and
“significantly discourage” usage,  Barclays Capital  said.  Airline and expressway operators gained in China on
speculation passengers will increase airplane and car travel
following the rail crash.  China Eastern Airlines Corp. climbed 1.2 percent to 5.09
yuan in Shanghai.  Air China Ltd. (601111)  increased 3.6 percent to
HK$8.08 in Hong Kong. China Southern Airlines Co. advanced 3.4
percent to HK$5.17. Shenzhen Expressway Co., which manages and
operates highways and expressways in China, rose 2.9 percent to
4.90 yuan.  “We expect travelers to gradually turn to alternative
transport means, including expressways,” Patrick Xu and Jon Windham, analysts at Barclays Capital, wrote in a report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
