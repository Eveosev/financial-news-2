Kenya will begin producing
genetically modified cotton from 2014, when seeds will be
released to farmers, Business Daily reported, citing Agriculture
Secretary Wilson Songa.  The production of the disease-resistant, drought-tolerant
fiber may help the country meet annual domestic demand of
200,000 bales, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
