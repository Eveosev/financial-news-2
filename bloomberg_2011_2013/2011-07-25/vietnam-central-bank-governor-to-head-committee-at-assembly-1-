State Bank  of Vietnam Governor
Nguyen Van Giau has been elected the head of the Economic
Committee at the National Assembly, according to a statement
posted on the government’s website yesterday.  Last week, three people with knowledge of policy makers’
discussions on the matter said Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung
will appoint the State Bank of Vietnam’s Deputy Governor Nguyen Van Binh as the next leader of the bank, replacing Giau.  The State Bank, led by Giau since 2007, has struggled to
contain  Asia ’s highest inflation and this month cut a key
 interest rate  even as price gains accelerated. Binh, one of five
deputy governors, will inherit the challenge of building
credibility for the monetary authority.  “The central bank needs to improve transparency and
communication with the market,” Matt Hildebrandt, a Singapore-
based economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in an e-mail today.
“There’s no expectation-setting in  Vietnam  at all when it comes
to inflation. That’s just as important as adjusting monetary
policy settings.”  The National Assembly will vote on Dung’s selection for the
next chief of the State Bank of Vietnam likely in early August,
two of the people said last week. They spoke on condition of
anonymity because the discussions weren’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
