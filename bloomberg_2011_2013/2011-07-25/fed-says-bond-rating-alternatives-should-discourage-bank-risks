The  Federal Reserve  said replacing
bond ratings with new ways of assessing banks’ assets must
ensure that financial firms don’t take on excessive risks and
avoid increasing the regulatory burden for small institutions.  Last year’s Dodd-Frank Act overhauling financial laws
requires federal agencies to remove regulatory references to
reliance on credit ratings and establish alternative standards
of creditworthiness. The Fed is working with other agencies on
standards that are “effective in identifying and grading risk,
consistently applied and least burdensome,” the central bank
said today in a progress report in Washington.  The Fed report is part of a broader effort by the
government to reduce reliance on credit ratings. A report from
the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission said that the major
credit raters were “key enablers of the financial meltdown,”
justifying the exploding sales of mortgage-related securities
before turning around and issuing rating downgrades that
“wreaked havoc across markets.”  New standards should have “broad applicability and be
sensitive to the risk posed by different exposures,” the Fed
said today. For the Fed, credit ratings are used mainly in rules
assigning risk weights when counting assets toward banks’
required capital.  “Alternative standards of creditworthiness are also most
effective when they result in generally consistent treatment of
assets across regulated entities and when supervisors are able
to apply the standards consistently,” the Fed said in today’s
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
