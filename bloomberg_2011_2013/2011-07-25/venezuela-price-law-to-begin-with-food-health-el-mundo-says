Venezuela â€™s new price regulation law
will begin operating in the next three months will begin by
setting maximum prices on food, medicine, construction
materials, textiles, shoes and school materials,  El Mundo 
reported, citing Commerce Minister Edmee Betancourt.  The law is likely to work by setting price range for
products and will not necessarily be applied to all sectors of
the economy, Betancourt said, according to Caracas-based El
Mundo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
