Clouds of uncertainty hover over the Western world. The consequences are stalling action. Companies are sitting on piles of cash, several CEOs have told me, as they wait for a resolution to the  U.S. debt crisis  before deciding what and where to invest or whether to hire.  Job creation is slow  and  unemployment high , leaving millions uncertain about their futures. Europeans wait for a resolution to financial woes from the south affecting the north, and in a safe, sane Nordic country, Norway, fear rises from a seemingly insane  terrorist shooting  that cost nearly a hundred lives. Safe harbors have uncertainty, too.  Companies can make strategic choices once they know what conditions will apply — will laws change, will taxes be raised or lowered, will interest rates go up or down? You could be a CEO weighing factory location decisions in the U.S. or abroad, or a retail entrepreneur deciding where and when to open more stores. Waiting for decisions that provide a direction, any direction, can be paralyzing. Motivating people to try something new, or to get on with innovation, is tough when the rules of the game are up in the air. Uncertainty is one of the primary reasons that people resist change. People are relatively adaptable once they know what the situation is, like it or not. Perfect clarity is not always possible, and leaders are not always in control of events. But that doesn't mean all the action must stop. Here are five tips for managing under uncertainty.  Provide certainty of process.  Even if we can't tell people what the outcome will be, we can provide clarity about when information will be provided. A calendar filled in with communication dates can reduce some of the anxiety of uncertainty. It's good leadership to overcome reluctance to say "I don't know," and instead to engage people in discussion about the situation, letting them know when they'll know. Emphasizing meaningful rituals is another tactic. To have some things that the community or family does together regularly, no matter what, increases the ability to get on with the action even if situations aren't yet fully resolved. Tackle maintenance and repair.  Uncertain times, when some things are on hold, provide a good opportunity for fix-ups and clean-ups. Uncertainty makes it tempting to let things deteriorate (maybe we won't keep this office going or live in this place any longer). But fixing things that can be improved represents productive action. For example, for job-seekers, embarking on a fitness regiment can add energy, lift spirits, and potentially make the person more attractive to a potential employer. Let ideas flow.  Opening the brainstorming faucet washes away some uncertainty. Since uncertainty leads to rampant gossip and speculation anyway, it can be a good time to harness imagination toward productive ends. Big companies have equally big planning departments, undoubtedly spewing out data files of alternative scenarios, but average workers and ordinary people can play, too. Brainstorming about possible futures stimulates imagination about what to do under nearly any circumstance. Will they or won't they raise the debt ceiling? Will there be a law favoring green investments, or not — or should there be a push for one? Which newspapers are better weathering the digital revolution? How will retailing look different with or without lower unemployment?  Seeds of innovation could sprout.   Mobilize appreciation for key constituencies.  Showing appreciation to valued customers is the business equivalent of gathering loved ones to reminisce about wonderful times together. Thanking customers for their loyalty or appreciating suppliers for their contributions doesn't involve making promises, but it does make friends.  And sometimes those gestures of appreciation bear fruit in the revenue stream, when those who are appreciated decide to reciprocate by increasing their purchases or sharing their best new ideas. That can pay off regardless of changing directions. Use purpose and values to "think beyond."  Emphasizing who we are and what we stand for reminds people of the long-term, of the march of history beyond today's uncertainty.It provides grounding. It helps focus on the times ahead, not just today's troubles. It helps people remain connected to one another.  Clouds eventually give way to clarity. What separates the best from the rest is whether leaders communicate, improve, engage, invest in relationships, and remain true to principles. This can make the difference in getting stuck or emerging triumphant.
