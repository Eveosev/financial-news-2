The Swiss franc strengthened to a
record against the dollar on concern U.S. lawmakers may fail to
agree on a plan for raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling, spurring demand for the currency as a refuge.  The Swiss currency rose against all 16 of its major peers
tracked by Bloomberg, climbing 1.8 percent versus the euro, as
the question of a potential U.S. default was left unresolved
after weekend talks between Republicans and Democrats didn’t
break the political stalemate. The yield on the U.S. 30-year
Treasury bond climbed seven basis points to 4.33 percent.  “What is pushing the franc stronger today is the focus on
the U.S. debt ceiling,” said  Chris Walker , a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG in  London . “Poor risk appetite and a
weaker dollar is a perfect scenario for the Swiss franc to be
stronger.”  The Swiss currency advanced as much as 2 percent to 80.29
centimes per dollar, the highest on record, and traded 1.4
percent stronger at 80.76 centimes at 4:16 p.m. in London. The
franc climbed for the first time in three days against the euro,
rising 1.5 percent to 1.15836.  To contact the reporter on this story:
