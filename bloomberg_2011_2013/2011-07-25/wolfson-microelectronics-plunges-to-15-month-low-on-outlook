Wolfson Microelectronics Plc (WLF)  fell to
its lowest since April last year in London trading after the
U.K. semiconductor maker forecast second-half revenue will be
“flat” compared with a year earlier as consumer demand slows.  Second-quarter sales increased 7.2 percent to $38.6 million
from a year earlier, compared with a rise of 44 percent in the
forecast, the Edinburgh-based maker of audio chips for
smartphones, televisions and tablet computers, said in a
statement today. The company lowered its 2011 revenue growth
forecast to less than 10 percent.  “Our customers are being very cautious and waiting to see
how things pan out,” Chief Executive Officer  Mike Hickey  said
on a conference call. “Unless there is some weird stalling of
consumer demand, we should return to growth next year.”  Revenue growth among U.S. semiconductor makers in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index is estimated to fall to 6.1 percent
in 2012 from 17 percent this year, Bloomberg data show. The
smartphone market may grow 55 percent this year after expanding
87 percent in 2010, according to market researcher IDC.  Wolfson’s shares slumped 11 percent, or 18.5 pence, the
biggest drop since June 27 when it issued its first revenue
growth warning, to 155 pence. The shares plunged 47 percent so
far this year, cutting the company’s market value to about 180
million pounds ($293 million).  The revenue forecast compared with one for 10 percent to 20
percent growth four weeks ago.  Audio Chips  Wolfson expects revenue growth to resume next year as its
audio chips are disintegrated from the core chips used in
smartphones and other consumer products, Hickey said.  “Looking to the longer term, Wolfson is a much stronger
company than it was in the last industry down-cycle,” Citigroup
Inc. analyst Timothy Shaw, who has a “buy” rating on the
stock, said in a note to clients today. “Growth in 2012 still
carries uncertainty and fears of further downgrades to 2012
consensus may weigh on Wolfson in the short term.”  Wolfson’s second-quarter loss narrowed to $2.6 million, or
1.8 cents a share, from $2.8 million, or 0.8 cent, a year
earlier, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
