Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell after
the government said it would maintain a tight monetary policy,
citing inflationary pressures. The dong was little changed.  There are “still risks that would affect the economy and
prices from now to the end of the year,” Nguyen Tien Thoa, head
of price control at the  finance ministry , said yesterday.
Consumer prices in the nation increased 22.16 percent from a
year earlier this month, after having risen 20.82 percent in
June, official data released last week showed.  “Since the inflation risks are increasing, the secondary
market saw a rise in bonds yields,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based
Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at ACBS Securities Inc.  The yield on five-year bonds rose four basis points, the
most since July 18, to 12.49 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong was little changed at 20,575 per dollar as of 3:02
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The central bank set the reference rate at 20,608 today.
The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side
of the official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Ven Ram, Anil Varma  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
