Gulf Coast gasoline weakened to the
lowest level in more than a month after U.S. refinery use
approached a one-year high.  U.S. refiners used 90.3 percent of processing capacity in
the week ending July 15, the highest level of refinery use since
July 30, 2010, according to Energy Department data.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf widened 1.5 cents to 5 cents a gallon versus futures traded
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:07 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped 1.66 cents
to $3.0785.  The Gulf region contains more than 40 percent of all U.S.
refining capacity.  Midwest gasoline rose after issues were reported at
refineries in the region.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it had a power disruption July 22 at
its Wood River refinery in  Illinois , the second in a month.  The 380,900-barrel-a-day refinery operated at reduced rates
for almost a month after a  power failure  June 25. The plant
returned to planned rates by July 18.  The discount for regular, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed 0.5 cent to 7.5 cents a gallon.  Exxon Mobil Corp.â€™s Joliet refinery in Illinois released
gases from a flare stack because of an equipment malfunction,
according to a filing with the National Response Center. A
faulty valve has been replaced, the filing showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
