Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s 
second-worst peforming currency over the past month, may weaken 
as much as 1.1 percent this week as importers take advantage of 
recent gains to buy goods, Bank of  Africa  Uganda Ltd. said.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer
fell 0.2 percent to 2,605 shillings per dollar at 4:51 p.m. in
the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It closed at 2,600 shillings against the dollar on July 22.  “We are net importers who will need dollars,” said Ahmed
Kalule, a trader at Bank of Africa in Kampala, in an interview
today. “I expect depreciation this week to a trading level of
2,595 to 2,630 shillings.”  The shilling fell to an 18-year low of 2,725 to the dollar
on June 30 as inflation rose to its highest level in almost two
decades. The currency has declined 4 percent over the last
month, a decline second only to the Turkish lira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
