Hansen Transmissions International
NV (HSN) , which makes gears for wind turbines, almost doubled in
market value after saying it agreed to a 444.8 million-pound
($724 million) cash offer from ZF Friedrichshafen AG.  ZF, a German manufacturer of auto-parts and agricultural
machinery, will pay 66 pence per share for Hansen, according to
a Regulatory News Service statement distributed today.  Hansen shares rose as much as 96 percent before closing 93
percent up at 65 pence in London trading, giving the company a
market value of 436 million pounds. That’s the biggest one-day
gain since December 2007.  Hans-Georg Haerter, chief executive officer of ZF Group,
said the acquisition of Hansen, whose plants in Lommel,  Belgium ,
Coimbatore, India and Tianjin, China have an annual production
capacity of 7,600 MW for wind turbine gearboxes, “represents a
natural extension of our strategic decision to enter the growing
and exciting field of wind energy.”  Hansen’s two largest shareholders,  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  and
Ecofin Ltd., which hold 38.4 percent of the company, gave
“irrevocable undertakings” to accept the offer, according to
the statement.  Hansen said its revenue for the three months ended June 30
declined 8.5 percent to 89 million euros ($128 million) from 81
million euros, while the company forecast revenue growth of
between five and 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
