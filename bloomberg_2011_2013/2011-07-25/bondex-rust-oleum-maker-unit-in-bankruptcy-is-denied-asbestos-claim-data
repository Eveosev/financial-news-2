Bondex International Inc. , the
bankrupt unit of Rust-Oleum maker  RPM International Inc. (RPM) , can’t
get data on compensation paid to asbestos victims the company
wants to use to calculate future liabilities, a court ruled.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Judith K. Fitzgerald in Wilmington,
 Delaware , today denied Bondex’s request for details on payments
that some asbestos-victims’ trusts may have made to people who
also claimed to have been injured by Bondex’s home-repair
products.  Bondex and Specialty Products Holding Corp filed for
bankruptcy last year with plans to set up their own asbestos-
victims trust to resolve future and current suits. To calculate
how much money the companies, or their parent, RPM, must put
into the trust, the companies sought data on past payments.  Bondex’s plan to use the data is “all based on a
hypothetical that doesn’t exist,” the judge said in court.  Gregory M. Gordon, a Bondex attorney, said the model the
company is trying to create may predict lower future payments by
taking into account payments that other trusts made to victims
who sued Bondex.  Fitzgerald has allowed Bondex to collect other details from
asbestos victims to build its models.  Bankrupt companies and their parents can win immunity from
future asbestos lawsuits by setting up trusts to cover medical
and other costs associated with exposure to asbestos.  The bankruptcy case is In re Specialty Products Holdings
Corp., 10-11780,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
