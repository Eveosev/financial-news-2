Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc (RB/) , the
maker of Cillit Bang cleaners, reported second-quarter profit
that was ahead of analysts’ estimates as it sold more products
in developing markets.  Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time gains and
losses, rose 10 percent to 418 million pounds ($681.5 million),
the Slough, England-based company said today in a statement. The
median estimate of nine analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 412
million pounds.  Sales in developing markets surged on a comparable basis,
driven by a new Dettol men’s soap range. Reckitt Benckiser and
rivals such as  Procter & Gamble Co . are looking to growth in
emerging markets as  consumer spending  falters in Europe and the
U.S. The maker of Nurofen painkillers needs to find ways of
compensating for a potential loss of revenue in its healthcare
unit caused by the ending of exclusive rights to make the
Suboxone heroin-dependency drug in 2009.  “Given these strong first-half results, we are well-
positioned to achieve our full-year 2011 targets, and with that
to deliver another year of above industry-average growth,”
Chief Executive Officer Bart Becht said in the statement.  Second-quarter revenue rose 5 percent to 2.34 billion
pounds on a so-called like-for-like basis, which excludes the
effect of acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts. That was
faster than the first quarter’s 4 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
