China Petrochemical Corp. and two
partners said they plan to develop a “marginal” oil field off
the coast of Terengganu in  Malaysia .  China Petrochemical, or Sinopec Group, will hold 40 percent
of the project and invest between $400 million and $700 million,
according to a joint statement from the companies released in
Kuala Lumpur today. The partners are International Oil Design &
Construction Sdn. and Sabio Technology Sdn.  Malaysia is offering financial incentives such as
investment tax allowances and lower taxes to encourage the
development of less-profitable fields. The government is
counting on these fields to help boost production in the nation,
the second-largest oil and gas producer in  Southeast Asia , as
energy demand rises.  “Oil and gas has been identified as a key sector to help
engineer the transformation of our economy,”  Mustapa Mohamed ,
minister of international trade and industry in Malaysia, said
after witnessing an agreement signing with the companies in
 Kuala Lumpur  today.  Malaysia, the world’s second-largest exporter of liquefied
natural gas, yesterday agreed to buy 1.5 million metric tons of
LNG annually from Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. for at least 20 years
starting in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
