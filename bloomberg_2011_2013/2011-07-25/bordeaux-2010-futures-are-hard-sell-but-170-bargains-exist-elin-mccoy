Moon-shaped lanterns floated over a
Chateau Haut-Brion dinner during  Vinexpo  last month. Owner
Prince Robert of Luxembourg brushed off talk of 2010 prices,
launching into tales of his early screenwriting career.  Now we know: his 2010, still in barrel, can be had for
$1,159 a bottle. My advice? Don’t bother.  The long, drawn-out Bordeaux futures campaign finally
climaxed on Fourth of July weekend. Haut-Brion, Lafite, Latour,
and the other first growths released stratospheric prices while
most Bordeaux-obsessed Americans lazed, indifferent, at the
beach.  The powerful 2010 vintage follows right after the fantastic
2009, making the wines a tough sell. Prices trickled out very
slowly over two months and, on average, they’re 10 percent to 20
percent more than the 2009s, the most expensive Bordeaux in
history. With today’s weak dollar, U.S. buyers pay even more.  All this has American retailers moaning and griping. Ralph
Sands, Bordeaux specialist at the Bay Area’s  K & L Wine 
Merchants, says, “I’ve lost 70 percent of our loyal buyers over
these prices. The Bordelais are living in a bubble.”  Top 2010 second growths are more than $200 a bottle. Ditto
the first growths’ second labels.  Yes, there are “bargains” -- if you think in relative
terms.  Good Neighbors  One deservedly hot seller is smoky, elegant Pontet-Canet,
going fast for $170 a bottle. The estate sits next door to
Mouton Rothschild, whose 2010 costs six times more. The
sensational Grand-Puy-Lacoste ($90) is an even better buy,
though the price is 20 percent over the 2009.  Chateaux Calon-Segur ($110), Gruaud Larose ($75), Giscours
($74), Pedesclaux ($38), Cantemerle ($36), and Corbin ($35) all
made excellent wines trading at fair prices. Ducru-Beaucaillou
($240) is stunning and less than the 2009. Second label La Croix
de Beaucaillou ($55) comes with a new Jade Jagger label.  U.S. and U.K. retailers say they purchased smaller amounts
of fewer chateaux than last year because demand just isn’t
there.  “It’s not just high prices,” says  Sherry-Lehmann  chief
executive officer Chris Adams. “The releases dragged on so long
we lost momentum.”  Simon Staples of London’s  Berry Bros & Rudd  was
recuperating from futures frenzy in a pool in  Spain  when I
reached him. Last year he received 45,000 wish lists from
customers. This spring, he says, the number was 7,500. Still,
BBR sold more than 50 million pounds worth of futures, their
second best campaign ever.  Pricing Science  “Bizarrely, we had good interest in the first growths,”
he said. “but we could only get 360 cases each of Lafite and
Latour. Last year we sold 1,100 cases of each.” (The 2010s have
now escalated to $1,700 a bottle.)  The most overpriced wines, Staples says, didn’t sell.  The “science” of pricing involves a mix of factors. No
one wants to come out at less than their neighbors.  St. Emilion’s Cheval Blanc was one of the year’s
miscalculations. The barrel samples I sipped in April were
deliciously plush, but at $16,000 a case, 2010 costs $6,000 more
than 2005, which you can drink tonight. BBR unloaded only 30
cases compared to more than 200 of 2009.  Maybe owner LVMH’s calculation included the $18.5 million
price of the chateau’s new cellar, with a sensual design by
architect Christian de Portzamparc. As a colleague put it, “If
I were a grape, this is where I’d like to be crushed.”  No Sale  London  broker  Farr Vintners  didn’t sell a single case of
Chateau Lascombes at $1,296 ($108 a bottle). Every recent
available vintage costs less.  Did the owners put the price up to help sell the chateau?
If so, it worked. Two weeks ago French health insurance group
MACSF signed a deal to buy it from U.S. private equity firm
 Colony Capital LLC  for 200 million euros.  To make the 2010s more attractive to his customers,
California-based  JJ Buckley  cut margins and allows buyers to pay
only 60 percent down.  How much will  Asia  buy? The second largest number of
visitors at Vinexpo came from  China  and the Bordelais wooed
them. At the lavish Fete de la Fleur at Chateau Lascombes, the
menu was also in Chinese, and the decor included statues modeled
on a Chinese terracotta army.  Sam Gleave of London’s  Bordeaux Index  says their  Hong Kong 
office sold to more than 500 new clients. “Asia is gaining a
clearer understanding of how buying futures works,” he says.
“And they only know today’s high prices.”  Back to the Futures  Maybe so, but Maggy Chan of Hong Kong’s  Maxford Wines  says
she bought fewer futures than in 2009. Decanter magazine
reported last week that Aussino, one of China’s largest wine
retailers, with 200 stores in 100 cities, will stop promoting
the Left Bank crus classes because of dangerous pricing.  “The main reason to purchase futures in the past was that
it was always the lowest price for a chateau’s wine, and that’s
no longer guaranteed,” says Paul Favale of negociant Joanne
USA.  If the dollar strengthens against the euro, the wines might
be cheaper when they arrive in two years.  And you can always wait for 2011.  ( Elin McCoy  writes on wine and spirits for Bloomberg News.
