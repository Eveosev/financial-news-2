First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar modules, has sold a 9.9-
megawatt project in northwest Spain to an investment fund
managed by KGAL GmbH & Co.  First Solar will supply panels for the plant near Zamora,
which is currently being built by Gehrlicher Solar Espana, the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said today in a  statement  on
its website. The project will provide electricity for 3,400
households when it’s completed in December.  KGAL’s European Solar Power Fund paid about 35 million
euros ($50 million), Klaus Wolf, a KGAL managing director, said
today in an interview. With the Zamora purchase, the Gruenwald,
Germany-based investment company’s fund owns more than 200
megawatts of projects that generate power from the sun.  The fund has invested 460 million euros in solar projects,
mainly in Germany, Spain and  Italy , and Wolf said it may invest
another 400 million euros to 500 million euros. “We are
continuously scanning the market for new transactions,” he
said.  Spain currently leads the world in commissioned solar
projects, with more than 2,500 megawatts in operation, according
to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. It has another 5,000 megawatts
planned or under construction. Solar power is set to become the
most-installed energy source in the European Union this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
