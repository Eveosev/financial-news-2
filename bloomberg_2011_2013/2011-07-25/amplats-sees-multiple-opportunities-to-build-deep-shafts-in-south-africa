Anglo American Platinum Ltd. said it
sees “multiple” deep-shaft opportunities within the next 10-
to-20 years in  South Africa , mainly in the Western Limb region.  “We still have deep Merensky shafts to develop, Tumela 3
and 4 shaft, and Union Deeps,” the company said. “While these
will be capital intensive shafts, we believe that they will be
competitive at that time because of our PGM market development
initiatives.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
