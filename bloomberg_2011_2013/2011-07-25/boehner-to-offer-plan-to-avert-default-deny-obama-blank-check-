House Speaker  John Boehner ’s office
said he will unveil a plan today to prevent a default on the
 U.S. debt  while cutting spending and denying President Barack Obama a “blank check” to borrow more money without trimming
expenditures.  In a blog post on his website, Boehner’s staff wrote that
his plan “is aimed at stopping President Obama’s indefensible
quest for a debt-limit increase that would run past the next
election without a process in place to ensure spending is being
cut as the debt ceiling is being raised.”  The plan Boehner is proposing would provide an immediate
debt-ceiling increase of about $1 trillion, accompanied by the
same level of spending cuts, and charge a congressional
committee with devising more debt savings before the president
is granted additional borrowing authority. The speaker is to
brief House Republicans on  Capitol Hill  this afternoon.  Obama, who has requested a $2.4 trillion increase in the
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling to last into 2013, has said he would
veto such a plan, arguing that it would lead to economic
uncertainty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
