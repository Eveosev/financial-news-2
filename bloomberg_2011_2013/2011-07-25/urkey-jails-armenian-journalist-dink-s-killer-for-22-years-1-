A Turkish man was sentenced to 22
years and 10 months in jail for the murder of ethnic-Armenian
journalist Hrant Dink.  Ogun Samast was found guilty of homicide and possessing
arms without a license, according to the state-run Anatolia news
agency, which cited an Istanbul juvenile court decision.  Dink was shot three times in the head and neck outside the
offices of his Agos newspaper on Jan. 19, 2007. Scores of people
have been arrested in connection with his assassination,
including six gendarmerie officers. Prosecutors also questioned
police officers and a former governor of Istanbul.  Samast was tried by a juvenile court because he was under
18 when he committed the murder. Dink’s family is charging that
security forces in the northern province of Trabzon, where
Samast came from, and in Istanbul failed to act on intelligence
that Dink would be assassinated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
