Iraq ’s wheat production amounts to
1.8 million metric tons this year and the country is due to
become an exporter of the grain by 2015, Deputy Agriculture
Minister Ghazi al-Abudi said.  Output is on course to reach 2.25 million to 2.5 million
tons at the end of the season this year, the minister said today
at a press conference in  Baghdad . “Production is due to reach 3
million tons next year and Iraq is expected to become a wheat
exporter by 2015 in line with government plans,” he said.  Iraq produced 1.875 million tons last year, Amer Abdul
Aziz, spokesman for the Grain Board of Iraq, said July 19. The
harvest so far this season covers about 40 percent of total
national demand of about 4.5 million tons, he said.  The country will probably import another 1 million tons of
wheat before the end of the year after buying 1.5 million tons
so far in 2011, Hasan Ibrahim, the board’s general director,
said June 7. Iraq tendered last week for 100,000 tons of wheat
from all origins, with a bidding deadline of July 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
