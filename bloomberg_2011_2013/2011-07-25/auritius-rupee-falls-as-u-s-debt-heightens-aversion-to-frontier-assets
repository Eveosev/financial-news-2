Mauritius’s rupee depreciated
against the dollar as odds of a U.S. debt default increased and
Moody’s investors Service cut  Greece ’s sovereign-credit rating,
curbing demand for riskier, frontier-market assets.  The currency dropped as much as 0.3 percent to 28.15 per
dollar and traded at 28.05 by 12:26 p.m. in  Port Louis , the
capital. Against the euro, the currency of the Indian Ocean
island nation’s main trading partner, the rupee strengthened 1
percent to 40.3004 rupees.  Emerging-market stocks snapped four days of gains as U.S.
lawmakers failed to agree on raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion
debt ceiling, with Republican lawmakers preparing to force
action on a shorter-term extension of the debt ceiling than
President Barack Obama has requested. Greece’s long-term
foreign-currency debt was downgraded to Moody’s second-lowest
rating, the company said today.  “The global risk backdrop has not improved considerably,
despite the announcement of a new deal for Greece,” Societe
Generale SA emerging-market strategists including London-based
Gaelle Blanchard wrote in an e-mailed research note today.
“Emerging-market assets remain subject to profit-taking risk
which warrants a cautious stance, in our view, especially on the
foreign-currency side.”  The breakdown in U.S. debt talks has “increased the
uncertainty level in the markets,” Mauritius Commercial Bank,
the country’s largest lender by market value, said in an e-
mailed note to clients today.  The buying price for the dollar ranged from 27.3643 rupees
to 27.5225 rupees, with a selling price of 28.8145 rupees per
dollar, according to indicative rates on the  Bank of Mauritius’s
website .  Mauritius’s 38-member SEMDEX index of stocks dropped 0.6
percent to 2,036.77, led by Mauritius Commercial Bank and  State
Bank  of Mauritius Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
