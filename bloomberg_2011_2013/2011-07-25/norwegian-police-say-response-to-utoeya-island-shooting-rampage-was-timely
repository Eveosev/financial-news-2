Norwegian police said they responded
as fast as possible to reports of shooting on the island of
Utoeya, where Anders Behring Breivik went on a rampage that
claimed the lives of 68 youths.  The first report of the July 22 shooting was received at
5:27 p.m. by police in the Nordre Buskerud district in which
Utoeya is located and the gunman was apprehended at 6:27 p.m. by
the Emergency Response Team from Oslo, two minutes after they
arrived on the island, spokesman Henning Holtaas said by phone.
Officers in Oslo were dealing with the aftermath of a related
bomb attack in the capital as the island shooting began.  “I completely understand that for those caught in the line
of fire as well as for their relatives the response time felt
long,” Chief of Police Sissel Hammer of Nordre Buskerud Police
District said in a statement yesterday. “However, I ask for
understanding of the fact that the deployment of armed police
personnel will always require time. Personnel need time to be
equipped and armed as well as transported to the scene.”  The twin attacks on Utoeya and in Oslo killed 76 people in
all, with most of the victims shot on the island about 40
kilometers (28 miles) from the capital by car, the police said
today, revising down an earlier estimate of 93 fatalities. The
police will have to answer questions about the speed of their
response to the events on Utoeya, Oslo-based newspaper Dagbladet
 reported .  Single Helicopter  The Emergency Response Team had already been assembled in
Oslo following the bomb attack two hours earlier, which claimed
the lives of eight people, and travelled to the island by car
because the only helicopter available to the police was not
equipped for the task, Holtaas said. Police in  Norway  do not
routinely carry firearms.  “Considering the equipment that they needed, it was easier
as they sat in their cars, just to drive directly out there,”
Holtaas said. Norway’s only police helicopter is used for
monitoring and surveillance and “doesn’t have the capacity in
that helicopter to bring personnel.”  Breivik’s rampage on the island lasted 90 minutes, during
which he is alleged to have called on the youths to come to him
for police protection, before shooting them point-blank. He was
wearing a fake police uniform.  Breivik was detained for eight weeks pending trial at a
closed court hearing in Oslo today. At least four of those weeks
will be spent in isolation, with no visits, letters or contact
with the outside world, Judge Kim Heger told reporters.  Lessons to Learn  Of the 97 people injured in the twin attacks, 67 were from
the island shootings, Oslo’s acting police chief Sveinung
Sponheim said at a press conference yesterday.  “So far we have not seen anything that didn’t work as
expected or planned” in the police operation, Prime Minister
Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview today on BBC World. Now is
the time to comfort the relatives and friends of those killed
and injured, and “afterward we will go through everything that
happened, learn from the experiences,” he said. “Of course
there will always be something we can learn and where we could
have been more prepared.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
