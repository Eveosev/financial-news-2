The board of the London Metal
Exchange approved the resignation of J.P. Morgan Metals Ltd. as
a category 4 associate broker member, the  exchange  said.  The resignation is valid with immediate effect, the LME
said today in a notice to members and warehouse companies.  J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. became a category 1 ring
dealing member following the U.S. bank’s $1.7 billion
acquisition of RBS Sempra Commodities units in July 2010.
Category 1 members are entitled to trade in the ring, on the
LMEselect electronic platform and on the telephone market.  RBS Sempra Metals, which later became J.P. Morgan Metals
Ltd., had its category 1 status downgraded to a category 4
membership at the time. Category 4 members aren’t members of the
clearing house nor may they trade in the ring, operating through
the 24-hour inter-office market, according to the LME website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
