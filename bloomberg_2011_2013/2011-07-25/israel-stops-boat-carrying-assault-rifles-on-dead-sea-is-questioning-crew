Israeli security forces stopped a
small rubber boat on the  Dead Sea  and arrested two Palestinians
on board carrying assault rifles and ammunition from Jordan to
the West Bank, the  army  said.  On intercepting the vessel, soldiers found 10 AK-47 assault
rifles and 10 ammunition magazines, an army spokeswoman said,
speaking anonymously under military regulation. The two
Palestinians are being held on smuggling charges, she said.  Israel intercepted a cargo ship in March that was headed
for  Egypt  in the Mediterranean Sea and carrying a stash of
concealed weapons that included six land-to-sea missiles, 2,500
mortar shells, two radar systems, two missile launchers and
about 67,000 bullets for Kalashnikovs, the army said. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Ashdod port to review
the weapons and said  Israel  would get tougher on smugglers.  The Dead Sea lies at the lowest point on earth, 1,388 feet
(423 meters) below sea level. The eastern shore is in Jordan and
western shore includes Israel and the West Bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
