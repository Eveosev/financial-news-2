Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  and  Intercontinental
Bank Plc (INTERCON)  filed a notice to the  Securities and Exchange
Commission  outlining Access’s plan to buy the rival Nigerian
lender.  Nigeria’s capital-markets regulator got a “pre-merger
notice” from the banks that is now “receiving attention,”
Lanre Oloyi, a spokesman for the SEC, said by phone today from
Abuja, the capital. “No approval has been given,” he said,
denying a report in the Lagos-based Vanguard newspaper that the
SEC had approved the deal.  Access wants to acquire Intercontinental, a lender bailed
out by Nigeria’s central bank in 2009 and facing a deadline to
meet capital adequacy requirements by the end of September. The
lenders will create “one of  Africa ’s largest financial
institutions,” they said in a statement on July 11.  The central bank fired the chief executives of eight of
 Nigeria ’s 24 banks in 2009 after a debt crisis that threatened
the country’s banking industry with collapse. The regulator
bailed out the lenders, including Intercontinental Bank, with
620 billion naira ($4 billion).  Intercontinental declined for the third day in four, losing
5 kobo, or 5 percent, to close at 95 kobo per share by the close
in Lagos. Access Bank fell for the first day in five, closing at
6.72 naira after dropping 1 kobo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
