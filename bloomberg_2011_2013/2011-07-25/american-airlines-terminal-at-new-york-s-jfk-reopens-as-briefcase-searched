American Airlines  reopened the
ticketing area and lower baggage claim of its terminal at New
York City’s John F. Kennedy airport after a brief evacuation to
investigate an unattended briefcase.  The terminal was reopened at 9 a.m. local time after the
bag was searched and found to contain papers and other normal
business materials, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port
Authority of New York &  New Jersey , which oversees the airport.  The owner of the bag has been identified and is on a flight
bound for San Francisco, he said.  The unattended bag was found between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m.
local time today, prompting American to empty parts of the
terminal and call in security authorities, said Ned Raynolds, a
spokesman for the carrier. American’s parent company  AMR Corp. (AMR) 
is based in  Fort Worth , Texas.  JFK is the sixth-busiest airport in the U.S., with 46.5
million passengers last year, and is a hub for international
flights for carriers including American and Delta Air Lines Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
