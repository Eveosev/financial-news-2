Solvay SA (SOLB) , the world’s largest soda-
ash maker, reported second-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates as price increases and rising demand for some products
compensated for higher energy costs.  Net income more than doubled to 111 million euros ($160
million) from 44 million euros a year earlier, the Brussels-
based company said today in a statement. Profit topped the 100.3
million-euro average of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Solvay said it raised prices for products including soda
ash, caustic soda, polyvinyl chloride and specialty polymers by
11 percent. The volume sold increased 4 percent after Solvay
removed bottlenecks to expand production capacity for specialty
polymers.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization
and special items rose 12 percent to 304 million euros and were
unchanged as a proportion of revenue, at 18 percent.  The manufacturer confirmed the earnings figures after
highlights of a statement scheduled to be published July 28 were
accidentally posted on Solvay’s website at 3:27 p.m. local time
and subsequently removed. The soda-ash maker will publish full
earnings as planned before the start of trading on July 28.  Solvay gained 2.5 percent to 110.75 euros at the 5:40 p.m.
close of trading on Euronext Brussels, extending the shares’
advance this year to 39 percent. Today’s increase was the
biggest on the 23-company Stoxx 600 Chemicals Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
