Aeon Co.,  Japan â€™s biggest
supermarket chain, said beef suspected to be contaminated with
radioactive cesium was put on sale at a total of 174 of its
stores across Japan.  Aeon found 4,108 kilograms (9,056 pounds) of the beef was
put on shelves in stores in  Tokyo  and 28 other prefectures,
according to a faxed statement from the company today. The
figure includes locations previously announced by the company.  Supermarkets throughout Japan have been testing beef sold
in their stores after the Tokyo Metropolitan Government found
cesium levels in slaughtered cattle. Some of the beef had
already been sold before testing began. The government banned
sales of beef from Fukushima on July 19.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
