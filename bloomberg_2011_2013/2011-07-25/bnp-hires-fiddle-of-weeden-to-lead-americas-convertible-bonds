BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA, France’s largest
bank, hired Fred Fiddle from Weeden & Co. to run convertible-
bond issuance in the Americas.  Fiddle, whose position is newly created, will lead the
strategic equity and convertible origination business in the
region from New York, according to a statement from the Paris-
based company. He will report to Pierre Lapomme, head of equity
capital markets for the Americas, and Fabrice Hugon, head of
structured equity sales for the Americas, the statement said.  Prior to Weeden, Fiddle spent 23 years at Charlotte, North
Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch unit, where
he was head of equity-linked origination for the Americas after
earlier managing global equity linked sales and trading,
according to the statement.  Weeden President Lance Lonergan and Bank of America
spokesman John Yiannacopoulos declined to comment on Fiddle’s
move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
