Peru ’s sol held near its highest
level in three years as President-elect Ollanta Humala appointed
government and central bank officials that eased investors’
concerns about how he’ll manage the economy.  The currency was little changed at 2.7367 per  U.S. dollar 
at 1:07 p.m. New York time, from 2.7365 on July 22.  Humala named Miguel Castilla, who served as outgoing
President Alan Garcia’s deputy finance minister, as his finance
minister July 21, and tapped central bank President Julio Velarde to remain in his post. The appointments are “very much
positive for Peruvian assets,” BNP Paribas said today in a note
to clients.  “The president’s message about his new cabinet, and above
all about Velarde and the  Finance Ministry  was good,” said
Ricardo Villamonte, head trader at Banco de Credito del Peru,
the country’s largest bank. “Investors feel more at ease and
have gotten rid of some of their dollars.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
