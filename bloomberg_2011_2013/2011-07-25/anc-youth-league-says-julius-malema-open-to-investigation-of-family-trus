The African National Congress Youth
League said a trust controlled by  Julius Malema , its president,
is used to help the poor and he is willing to have the trust
investigated.  The league is “fully behind” Malema, Sindiso Magaqa, the
league’s secretary general, told reporters in Johannesburg
today.  Yesterday the City Press newspaper reported that the trust
is used to collect fees for helping businessman win government
contracts. The Congress of South African Trade Unions and
opposition parties have called for Malema to be probed by the
police and tax authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
