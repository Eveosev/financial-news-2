U.S. stocks resumed declines as
Senator Chuck Schumer criticized House Speaker  John Boehner ’s
two-step plan to cut the federal deficit, fueling concern that
lawmakers will fail to raise the government debt limit and avoid
default.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
1,340.26 at 2:51 p.m. after earlier cutting its loss to less
than 0.1 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
