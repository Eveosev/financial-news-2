Klepierre (LI)  SA, Europeâ€™s second-
largest shopping-center owner, said profit was little changed in
the first half as disposals and lackluster  consumer spending 
curbed growth in rental income.  Pretax earnings excluding one-time charges, known as net
current  cash flow , fell to 184.1 million euros, or 99 cents a
share, from 185 million euros, or 99 cents, a year earlier, the
Paris-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. Net
asset value rose 4 percent from six months earlier to 29.2 euros
a share.  Chief Executive Officer Laurent Morel predicted in February
that net current cash flow would be little changed this year as
he made disposals to cut debt and finance a 3.7 billion-euro
development program through 2015. Rental income fell in  Greece ,
Hungary and Spain, where retailers are struggling amid weak
consumer spending and rising unemployment.  Klepierre gained 24 cents to 27.415 euros in Paris trading,
lifting the value of the company to 5.2 billion euros. The
shares were little changed for the year through last week,
compared with a 4.1 percent gain for the FTSE EPRA-Nareit
European Index of real estate stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
