Baidu Inc. rose in late U.S. trading
after reporting a 95 percent surge in second-quarter profit,
beating analysts’ estimates, after  China ’s biggest Internet
company by market value boosted search-engine advertising sales.  Net income climbed to 1.63 billion yuan ($252.6 million),
or 4.67 yuan per American depositary receipt, compared with
837.4 million yuan, or 2.4 yuan, a year earlier, Baidu said
today in a statement. That exceeded the 1.5 billion yuan average
of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Customers bought more advertising on Baidu’s website as the
Beijing-based company added users and extended its lead over
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  in China’s search-engine market. Chief Executive
Officer Robin Li, ranked the nation’s richest man by Forbes
magazine, is stepping up acquisitions to offer new services to
meet rising competition from Internet rivals including  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700)  and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  “Sectors like education and financial continue to spend
more on Baidu to build awareness,” Eric Wen, who rates Baidu
shares “buy” at Mirae Asset Securities in  Hong Kong , wrote in
a July 22 report. “Baidu’s growth potential is still bright.”  Baidu’s shares increased as much as 8.9 percent to $170.51
in extended trading, after closing at $156.54 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. The stock had gained 62 percent this year, after
more than doubling in 2010. That compares with the 21 percent
gain in the Hong Kong-traded shares of Tencent, China’s biggest
online-games company, and the 22 percent decline in  Alibaba.com
Ltd. (1688) , the business-to-business unit of Alibaba Group, the
country’s biggest e-commerce company.  Revenue Forecast  Revenue is expected to be 3.95 billion yuan ($611.1
million) and 4.05 billion yuan ($626.6 million) in the third-
quarter, Baidu said. That compares with the 3.67 billion yuan
average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Baidu accounted for 75.9 percent of China’s search-engine
market by revenue in the second-quarter, rising from 75.8
percent in the previous three months, according to research
company Analysys International. Google’s share dropped to 18.9
percent from 19.2 percent, the researcher said.  Google has been losing ground in China’s search-engine
market since January 2010, when the  Mountain View , California-
based company said it was no longer willing to comply with
Chinese regulation to self-censor Web content. Two months later,
the U.S. company shut its Google.cn service and redirected
Chinese users to its site in Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
