South Korean  consumer confidence  was
unchanged in July from last month and inflation expectations
reached the Bank of  Korea ’s 4 percent target ceiling.  The sentiment index was 102, unchanged from June and down
from May’s three-month high of 104, the Bank of Korea said in an
e-mailed statement from Seoul today. A reading above 100
indicates optimists outnumber pessimists.  The expected inflation rate over the next year was 4
percent, faster than last month’s 3.9 percent and the highest
since April, today’s report showed.  A sub-index measuring consumers’ views of the economic
outlook climbed to 88 from 86 in the previous month.  The consumer confidence index is based on survey responses
from 2,015 households in 56 cities. It was conducted by mail and
telephone between July 13 and July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
