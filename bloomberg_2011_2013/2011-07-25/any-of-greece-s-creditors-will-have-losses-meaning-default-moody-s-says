Greece ’s creditors will suffer
losses as the nation struggles to pay its debts, Moody’s
Investors Service said in a weekly report.  “It is now virtually certain that many of Greece’s
private-sector creditors will experience credit losses that we
define as a default,” Alastair Wilson and Bart Oosterveld, both
managing directors, wrote in the report that Moody’s sent by e-
mail today.  Greece’s long-term foreign currency debt was cut three
steps to Ca from Caa1 earlier today by the rating company.  The bailout plan will contain the risk that the region’s
debt crisis will spread, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
