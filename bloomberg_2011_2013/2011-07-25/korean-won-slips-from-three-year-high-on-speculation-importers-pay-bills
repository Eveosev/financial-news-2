South Korea ’s won fell, retreating
from a three-year high, on speculation importers were taking
advantage of recent gains to settle bills.  Government bonds 
rose.  The currency strengthened in each of the last four trading
sessions, advancing 0.8 percent versus the greenback, after
European leaders agreed on a package to contain the region’s
debt crisis. It declined today amid concern policy makers will
intervene to stem appreciation that poses a risk to exports.  “There is steady dollar demand from importers such as oil
refineries,” said Roh Sang Chil, chief currency dealer with
Kookmin Bank in Seoul, the nation’s biggest lender. “The market
is also finding it difficult to break the 1,050 level amid a
perception that the authorities may not feel comfortable with
the pace of gains in the currency.”  The won weakened 0.4 percent to 1,056.26 per dollar as of 3
p.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 1,050.05 on July 22, the strongest level since
August 2008.  The yield on South Korea’s 4 percent bonds due March 2016
fell one basis point to 3.99 percent, according to prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. The rate increased eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
