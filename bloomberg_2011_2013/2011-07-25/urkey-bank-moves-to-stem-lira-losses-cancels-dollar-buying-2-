Turkey ’s central bank moved to stem
a slump in the lira, suspending daily purchases of dollars and
cutting the cost of long-term deposits in foreign exchange. The
lira pared earlier losses.  The central bank in Ankara ended daily purchases of $30
million, according to an e-mailed statement today. It also
reduced the reserve requirement for banks on foreign currency
deposits of more than a year by as much as 2 percentage points
to 9 percent.  The bank cited the need to monitor “implementation of the
decisions taken by the EU leaders to resolve European countries’
public debts.”  The lira extended a two-year low today with investors
citing concern that Turkey is not doing enough to tackle a
current account deficit that widened to 9 percent of economic
output in May. Central bank’s efforts, including making  consumer
lending  more costly, have so far failed to trim the import bill
while export growth has slowed with the crisis in  Europe .  The lira fell 0.6 percent to 1.7075 per dollar at 12:19
p.m. in Istanbul. The currency dropped as much as 2.2 percent
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
