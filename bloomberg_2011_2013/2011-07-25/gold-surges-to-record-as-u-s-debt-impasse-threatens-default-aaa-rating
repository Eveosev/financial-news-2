Gold futures climbed to a record
$1,624.30 an ounce as U.S. lawmakers failed to reach an
agreement on raising the federal debt limit, boosting demand for
the metal as a haven investment.  Republicans and Democrats are preparing separate plans to
raise the debt limit to avoid a default as early as Aug. 2.
 Greece ’s credit rating was cut three notches by Moody’s
Investors Service. Europe’s debt woes drove gold to all-time
highs in euros and pounds last week.  “Gold is feeding off the uncertainty of the debt
negotiations,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at Kingsview
Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Gold is
in a ‘can’t lose’ situation with the debt negotiations because
regardless of the outcome, the dollar is going to suffer.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $10.70, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $1,612.20 at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . The previous record was on July 19.  Mohamed A. El-Erian, whose Pacific Investment Management
Co. runs the world’s biggest bond fund, said the U.S. may lose
its AAA debt rating even if lawmakers avoid a default.  Gold is up 13 percent this year, heading for the 11th
straight annual gain. Investors boosted holdings in exchange-
traded products backed by the metal to a record 2,122.6 metric
tons on July 20.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 23.9 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $40.361 an ounce on the Comex.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $2.60, or 0.3
percent, to $809 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Platinum futures for October delivery fell $4.40, or 0.2
percent, to $1,794 an ounce on Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
