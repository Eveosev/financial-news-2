House Speaker John Boehner said his
two-step plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling and cut and cap
discretionary spending is a “responsible, common-sense proposal
that meets our obligations to the American people and preserves
the full faith and credit” of the U.S.  The Republican plan would allow a debt-limit increase of $1
trillion, to be followed later by about $1.6 trillion, while
larger spending cuts would be required.  “This plan is far from perfect, but it adheres to our
principles of ensuring that spending cuts are greater than any
debt hike and it includes no tax increases,” Boehner, an Ohio
Republican, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
