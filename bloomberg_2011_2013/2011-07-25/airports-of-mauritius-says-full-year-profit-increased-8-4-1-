Airports of Mauritius Ltd., which
manages the country’s airfields, said profit rose 8.4 percent in
the financial year through December.  Net income advanced to 503 million rupees ($17.9 million),
said Seewoosagar Nemchand, the finance and administration
director, in an e-mailed response to questions today. Revenue
rose by 5 percent to 1.1 billion rupees.  “The company’s turnover is expected to grow by around 20
percent in 2011,” Nemchand said. This will be due to “forecast
passenger growth of 4 percent, coupled with an increase in the
passenger service charge from 500 rupees to 1,000 rupees as from
June 1”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
