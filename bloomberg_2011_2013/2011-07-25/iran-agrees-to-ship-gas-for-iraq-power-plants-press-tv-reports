Iran  agreed to export natural gas a
day to power stations in  Iraq , Iranian state-controlled  Press TV 
said, citing Iraqi Oil Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi.  “We want to import about 800,000 cubic meters of natural
gas a day from Iran to supply fuel for the power plants through
a $300 million investment,” Luaibi said. The natural gas will
feed the Baghdad and Al-Nasseriya power stations in Iraq.  Luaibi was speaking during a ceremony held today in Tehran
for the signing of an agreement between Iraq, Iran and Syria to
transport Iranian natural gas from the Persian country’s South
Pars gas field to  Europe . Iraq, holder of the world’s fifth-
largest oil reserves, is struggling to rebuild its energy and
electricity industry after years of wars and sanctions. The Arab
country relies on imports of gas for its power needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
