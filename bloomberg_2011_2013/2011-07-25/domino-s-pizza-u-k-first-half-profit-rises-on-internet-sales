Domino’s Pizza U.K. and Ireland Plc,
the U.K.’s biggest pizza-delivery company, said first-half
profit rose 7.4 percent, led by  Internet sales .  Net income was 13 million pounds ($21 million), or 8.08
pence per share, in the 26 weeks ended June 26, from 12.1
million pounds, or 7.62 pence a share, a year earlier, the
 Milton Keynes , England-based company said in a statement.  Internet sales gained 51 percent, to 85 million pounds. The
company got 42 percent of its revenue on the web, up from 33
percent a year earlier, and each online order was as much as 15
percent larger on average, according to Chief Financial Officer
Lee Ginsberg.  “We had a very strong first half and will have strong
momentum going into the second,” Ginsberg said in a telephone
interview. “We’ll have TV and lots of promotional support.”  Domino’s said it opened a net 21 outlets in the half,
giving it a total of 688.  The shares rose 23.3 pence, or 5.1 percent, to 482.4 pence
in  London . They have fallen 13 percent so far this year, giving
the company a market value of 781.5 million pounds.  Domino’s will triple its marketing expenditure in the
second half from a year earlier, as it begins promoting a new
gourmet pizza line on “Red or Black,” a television game show
backed by “X Factor” creator  Simon Cowell . Full-year marketing
expenditure will increase to 45 million pounds, up from last
year’s 40 million pounds, Ginsberg said.  Same-Outlet Sales  First-half sales at outlets open at least a year gained 2.4
percent, slowing from 13.7 percent in the year-earlier period.
Such sales declined in Ireland in that country’s economic slump.  Domino’s said such sales should accelerate in the rest of
the year, partly because comparisons with last year will become
easier.  In April, Domino’s acquired a majority interest in the
master German franchisee, and the company plans to open at least
400 outlets in  Germany  in the next 10 years. German demographics
suggest the country could support as many as 1,700, Ginsberg
said.  Domino’s raised its dividend by 22.2 percent to 5.5 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
