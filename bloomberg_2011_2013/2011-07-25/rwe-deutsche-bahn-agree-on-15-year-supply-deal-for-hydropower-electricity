RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest
utility, has won a 1.3 billion-euro ($1.9 billion) contract to
supply  Deutsche Bahn  AG with renewable energy for its trains.  RWE and Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s biggest power customer,
signed a contract for about 900 gigawatt-hours of hydropower a
year from 2014 through 2028, the companies said in separate
statements today. Fourteen hydro plants run by RWE’s renewable
unit Innogy will supply the power, which is equivalent to the
yearly demand of about 250,000 households, RWE said.  Deutsche Bahn, which gets about half its power from coal-
fired plants, seeks to drive its entire train fleet with
electricity from renewable sources by 2050 in a bid to reduce
its greenhouse gas emissions. The contract with RWE “brings us
much closer to that vision,” Ruediger Grube, chief executive
officer of Deutsche Bahn, said in the statement.  The deal comes about four months after Deutsche Bahn lost
its biggest single power supplier, the Neckarwestheim 1 nuclear
reactor, which was shut down in March as part of  Germany ’s
decision to exit atomic energy by 2022. Operated by EnBW Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg AG, Neckarwestheim 1 had a capacity of 840
megawatts. "Nearly every fourth train was driven with power from
Neckarwestheim," Deutsche Bahn spokesman Achim Stauss said by
phone.  One of  Europe ’s biggest corporate producers of carbon
dioxide, RWE seeks to increase the share of renewables in its
capacity mix from 2,500 megawatts today to 4,500 megawatts by
2014, relying on hydropower, wind farms and biomass plants, said
Martin Pack, a company spokesman.  By the end of 2013, “we will have invested just under 4
billion euros in expanding our capacity from renewables,”
 Juergen Grossmann , the company’s chief executive officer, said
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
