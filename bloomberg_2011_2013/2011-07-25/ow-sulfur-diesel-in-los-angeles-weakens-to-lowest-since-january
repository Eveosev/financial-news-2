California-blend diesel in  Los
Angeles  weakened to the lowest level since January as traders
anticipated overall demand would remain weak in August.  Prompt-delivery, low-sulfur diesel in Los Angeles weakened
2.1 cents to reach parity with heating oil futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:07 p.m. East Coast time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the lowest
spread for the fuel since January, when it fell 2.75 cents below
futures.  California-blend diesel in  San Francisco  weakened 2.2
cents, also to reach parity with futures. The fuel traded at a
premium of 2.2 cents July 22.  Houston-based  ConocoPhillips (COP)  said it started units at the
Rodeo, California, refinery after a voltage drop over the
weekend forced process units to shut. The refinery can process
128,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount for prompt-delivery Carbob, California-blend
gasoline, in Los Angeles widened 3.6 cents to 17.75 cents versus
futures. The fuel strengthened 6.35 cents July 22 after August
trading began.  Carbob in San Francisco weakened 2.6 cents, also to a
discount of 17.75 cents.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon,
narrowed its discount 1 cent to 12.5 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
