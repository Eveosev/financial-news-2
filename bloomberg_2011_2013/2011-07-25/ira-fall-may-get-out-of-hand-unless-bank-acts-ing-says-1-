A decline in the Turkish lira may
``get out of hand” and the central bank should act to help 
regain market confidence, ING Groep NV said.  “We must see some central bank action this week,” Simon Quijano-Evans, head of emerging market research for the region
at ING, said in an e-mailed report to clients today. “Talk of a
diminishing current account deficit in the fourth quarter is not
going to help in our view, as that is simply too far away.”  The central bank should “meaningfully” cut the daily
foreign exchange auction size and/or raise its overnight
borrowing rate, “given that it refused to hike the one-week
repo rate,” Quijano-Evans said.  The lira dropped 1.6 percent to 1.7254 per dollar at 10:09
a.m., extending the weakest level since March 2009.  “The central bank’s decision to let lira foreign exchange
crosses head north is the reason why we continue to recommend
underweight or sidelined positions in  Turkey  both in equities
and fixed income,” Quijano-Evans said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
