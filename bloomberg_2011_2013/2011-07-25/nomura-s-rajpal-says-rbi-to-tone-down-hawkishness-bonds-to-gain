Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-based fixed-
income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc., comments on  India ’s
monetary policy in a report released today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change.  “We continue to expect a 25-basis point hike at the coming
policy meeting. However, we think this time around, the fall in
local growth data, along with a steady stream of poor economic
data globally, warrants some toning down of the RBI’s
hawkishness.  “We believe, if the RBI’s language is toned down, there is
likely to be a rally in bonds. However, the continuous supply in
bonds and the possibility of rate hikes should keep rallies
tactical and limited...We think 8.35 percent to 8.40 percent is
an attractive zone to buy 10-year bonds for cash investors.  “If there is a less hawkish outcome from the RBI, then we
think bonds could easily breach 8.20 percent levels on the lower
side. We think the market would need confirmation that the
terminal repo rate is 7.75 percent to sustain lower yield
levels.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
