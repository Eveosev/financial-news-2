Ethanol futures rose a third day to
the highest price in more than five years in  Chicago  on concern
that extreme heat in the Midwest may have cut production.  The grain-based gasoline additive climbed 1.4 percent on
speculation that a heat wave that blanketed the corn-rich U.S.
Midwest last week made it difficult for ethanol plants to
operate at full capacity. Above-normal temperatures in the
region are  forecast  to last through Aug. 4, according to the
Climate Prediction Center in  Camp Springs ,  Maryland .  “The intensity of the heat wave is making it difficult for
ethanol plants to run at full capacity without sacrificing yield
and is preventing plants from taking advantage of the attractive
margins available in the prompt market,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in  New York .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 4.1 cents to
settle at $2.983 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
highest settlement since July 17, 2006. Futures are up 25
percent this year.  Ethanol is up 17 percent in July. If that holds, it will he
best month for the biofuel since October, when it increased 17
percent.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf surged
17.5 cents, or 5.9 percent, to $3.125 a gallon and in Chicago
the additive increased 9.75 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.0925,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast added 6.5 cents, or 2.1 percent,
to $3.115 a gallon and in New York the biofuel gained 3 cents,
or 1 percent, to $3.01.  To contact the reporter on this story:
