Italian household confidence
declined for a second month in July as consumers grew more
pessimistic about the effect of government spending cuts and the
outlook for economic growth.  The sentiment index fell to 103.7 from 105.8 last month,
national statistics office Istat said today. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News had predicted a drop to 104.8, according to
the median of five forecasts.  The outlook for the euro region’s third-biggest economy
remains “uncertain” amid risks related “to the intensity of
the international recovery,” the Bank of  Italy  said last week.
The Rome-based central bank said it doesn’t expect “a
significant pickup in employment” after the jobless rate fell
to 8.1 percent in May. Retailers’ lobby  Confcommercio  forecast
on July 21 that Italy will expand 0.8 percent this year, down
from 1 percent projected in March.  The government led by Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
succeeded this month in obtaining Parliament’s approval of an
austerity plan after investors began dumping the securities of
Italy, holder of the region’s second-highest debt.  The measure, which aims to eliminate the  budget deficit  by
2014, extends a freeze on civil-servant wages, speeds a planned
increase in the  retirement age , cuts funding for regional
governments and ministries and will make Italians to pay 25
euros ($36) for some non-emergency hospital visits and 10 euros
above existing fees to see specialists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
