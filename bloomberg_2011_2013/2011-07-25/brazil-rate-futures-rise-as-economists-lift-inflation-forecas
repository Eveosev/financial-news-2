Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts climbed after economists increased their
forecasts for inflation next year to the highest ever.  Yields on the futures contract due in January rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.48 percent at 9:52
a.m. New York time. The yield on the contract due in January
2017 climbed six basis points to 12.55 percent. The real rose to
its highest level since January 1999.  The yields on the contracts, known as the DI curve,
advanced as traders increased bets on how much policy makers
will boost borrowing costs after economists lifted their
forecast for consumer price increases by the end of 2012 to 5.28
percent, from 5.20 percent a week earlier, according to the July
22 central bank Focus survey of about 100 economists published
today. In a statement accompanying their decision last week to
raise the benchmark Selic rate for a fifth straight time, policy
makers signaled they may soon stop raising borrowing costs.  “In the DI curve, what we see is that the market right
now, the investors especially, are not buying another hike in
the Selic rate, but the economists do have serious doubts about
the inflation in 2012,”  Andre Perfeito , chief economist at
Gradual Investimentos in  Sao Paulo , said. “That’s why we saw an
increase in the long part of the curve.”  The real strengthened 0.4 percent to 1.5466 per  U.S.
dollar , from 1.5520 on July 22. The currency touched 1.5050 on
Jan. 19, 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
