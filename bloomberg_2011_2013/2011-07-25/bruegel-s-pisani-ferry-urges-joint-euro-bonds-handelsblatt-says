The euro area can’t be sure of
surviving the debt crisis unless countries agree to introduce
joint euro bonds, Jean Pisani-Ferry, head of the Brussels-based
Bruegel Institute, said in a commentary in  Handelsblatt .  The European Union should lift the “taboo” of common debt
and introduce joint deposit insurance and financial supervision,
Pisani-Ferry wrote in the Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
