Singapore ’s currency-trading volumes 
averaged $361.5 billion a day in April, a 14 percent increase
from October, a survey by the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market
Committee showed.  Traditional spot trading, outright forwards and foreign-
exchange swaps averaged $314.2 billion per day, compared with
$278.4 billion in October, according to the  survey  released
today. Total volumes rose 32 percent. Daily turnover of
derivatives, comprising currency swaps and options, increased 20
percent to $47.2 billion from October, although declining 0.1
percent from April 2010, the survey showed.  Singapore’s gross domestic product increased 9.3 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, according to government
statistics, following a 14.5 percent annual expansion in 2010.  The semi-annual survey is based on data compiled from the
trading desks of 30 financial institutions and supported by the
Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Banks in the city-state accounted for 5 percent of the
global $4 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market in April 2010,
according to a triennial survey published in December by the
 Bank for International Settlements . Only the U.K, U.S. and  Japan 
had larger shares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
