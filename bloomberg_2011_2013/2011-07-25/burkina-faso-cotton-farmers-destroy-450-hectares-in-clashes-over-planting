Farmers in  Burkina Faso  destroyed
more than 450 hectares (1,112 acres) of cotton by digging up
fields in an attempt to force a boycott of this year’s
harvest, Radio Burkina reported, citing Laurent Sedogo,
agriculture minister.  Sedogo was meeting with farmers in the Bales province, 200
kilometers (124 miles) from Ouagadougou, the capital, to find
a resolution to the dispute, the state-owned broadcaster
reported today.  Burkina Faso ’s cotton-planting season, which runs in June
and July, has been marred by farmers’ boycotts over prices
they say are too low and later-than-normal seasonal rains. The
West African nation is the biggest grower of the fiber in sub-
Saharan  Africa .  One person was killed and five others injured when a
farmer allegedly opened fire on growers who were trying to dig
up plants on his field on July 23, said Maiza Compaore Sereme,
the state prosecutor in Boromo, the capital of Bales province,
by phone today. Sixty people were arrested, she said.  The farmers who were destroying fields have now pledged to
halt their protests, said Karim Traore, president of the
country’s national union of cotton producers, by phone after
the meeting with Sedogo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
