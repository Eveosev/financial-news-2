Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking,
the extraction of natural gas from rock thousands of feet below
ground, is the latest point of strain in the energy-versus-
environment tug of war. We side with those who focus on the
technique’s promise.  As long as the wells and wastewater pits are carefully
built and maintained, fracking can be a relatively clean and
safe way to obtain natural gas. Because natural gas can reduce
U.S. consumption of crude oil and coal, it can lessen dependence
on Mideast oil and significantly reduce  greenhouse gases  and
acid rain.  The U.S. possesses an estimated 827 trillion cubic feet of
gas available for extraction from rock, enough to meet current
natural gas consumption for 35 years. The U.S. uses about 20
trillion cubic feet of natural gas a year, mostly for
electricity production and home heating, but cars and trucks,
the biggest consumers of oil, could also be configured to run on
natural gas.  Plus, fracking creates jobs for people who do the drilling
and build and service the rigs and pipelines. Salaries are
relatively high, ranging from $28,000 for roustabouts to almost
$100,000 for engineers. And the jobs are especially needed in
regions that overlie the country’s most expansive deposits, the
Marcellus Shale -- in eastern Ohio and  Kentucky , western
 Pennsylvania , upstate  New York  and  West Virginia  -- which holds
some  262 trillion cubic feet  of recoverable natural gas.  Pennsylvania’s Experience  In Pennsylvania alone, fracking generated more than $11
billion in economic activity and more than $1 billion in state
taxes last year, according to  research  done for the  Marcellus
Shale Coalition , an alliance of shale gas drillers.  Those who worry that fracking can contaminate water sources
have legitimate concerns. The well-drilling process involves
digging straight down and then turning horizontally to bore into
the layer of shale that contains natural gas. Then, huge amounts
of water mixed mainly with sand but also with an assortment of
chemicals are pumped at enough pressure to create fissures in
the rock, so the gas flows through to the well.  Because the shale is thousands of feet down -- far below
aquifers -- the gas and chemicals can be kept away from drinking
water sources during the fracturing process. But the chemicals,
including such toxic substances as benzene, toluene and xylene,
can escape into the environment a number of ways.  Radioactive Elements  One possible point of leakage is the well. Once the shale
is fractured, tens of thousands of gallons of water flow back
to the surface, carrying with it the drilling chemicals and
sometimes small amounts of radioactive elements that occur
naturally below ground. If the well casing is not water-tight,
some of the flowback can seep from it.  If feasible, the wastewater is pumped back deep
underground. If not, it is poured into pits before removal by
truck for treatment and recycling. If storage pits are not lined
properly, or the waste is not correctly disposed of, extraction
chemicals can find their way into drinking water.  Increasingly, environmental groups and property owners are
charging that chemicals used in fracking are turning up in wells
and other water sources.  Need to Know  Fracking is clearly a process that requires regulation. The
public needs to know what chemicals are being used. Officials
do, too -- in case they have to search for the source of
suspected contamination. Proper monitoring is necessary to
ensure that drilling and waste management are done safely.  So who should oversee regulation? At the moment, the burden
is on state governments. Energy companies say this is ideal,
because it allows states to take into account geologic
differences and customize laws accordingly. But geology has had
little to do with the environmental problems that have arisen so
far. Well construction and disposal of waste are where the
problems have been.  What’s more, state regulators are scrambling to keep up
with the fracking boom. The result is a national checkerboard of
regulations to protect water, a resource that flows freely
across state lines. Then there’s that not insignificant matter
of fraying state budgets.  Oversight Needed  All of which leads to an inescapable conclusion: Federal
oversight is needed, to provide minimum, uniform rules that
protect drinking water everywhere. This will require an
adjustment to federal law.  In general, the  Environmental Protection Agency , in
managing the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, regulates
underground fluid injections. However, a 2005 amendment to the
Act exempts injections related to oil or gas production, unless
they involve the use of diesel (which is just one of about 750
chemicals and other components that suppliers use in their
fracking mixes).  U.S. Representative Diana DeGette, a Democrat from
 Colorado , proposes to close this loophole by allowing the EPA to
regulate the actual fracturing process. The proposal would
require drillers to disclose to authorities the names and
volumes of chemicals they use. To protect proprietary formulas,
only the chemicals, not the volumes, would be made public.  Management of fracking waste falls under the federal  Clean
Water Act , which also needs tightening. An exemption that
prevents the EPA from restricting runoff from oil-and-gas
industry wastewater pits after rainstorms should be lifted.  Given the boom in shale gas drilling, the EPA can’t
possibly police it all and will have to depend on state agencies
for inspections and enforcement. But the EPA must have more
authority to set national standards for the states to follow.  To be sure, shale gas is not a perfect fuel. But then there
is no such thing. Compared with coal and oil, gas burns
 relatively cleanly . Shale gas can help wean us from the dirtier
fuels. And it can do so without polluting the water, while
lessening dependence on imported oil.  Read more  Bloomberg View editorials .  To contact the Bloomberg View editorial board:
