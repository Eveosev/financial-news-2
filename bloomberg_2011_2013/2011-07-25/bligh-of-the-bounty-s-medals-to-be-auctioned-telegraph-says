Two gold medals awarded to British
Royal Navy Captain William Bligh are to be sold at auction in
 Australia  and may fetch as much as AU$250,000 ($270,625), the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, citing the auctioneers.  Bligh was overthrown by his mutinous crew in the Pacific in
1789, and sailed for 47 days in a 22-foot skiff with group of
his men before landing in West Timor; he went on to become
governor of New South Wales.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
