Olympic Group Financial Investments (OLGR) 
rose to the highest level in six months in Cairo trading after
 Electrolux AB (ELUXB)  offered to buy all the shares of  Egypt ’s biggest
publicly traded appliance maker.  The shares advanced 0.7 percent to 38.8 Egyptian pounds,
the highest since Jan. 24, at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. That
valued the company at 2.33 billion pounds ($391 million).
Egypt’s benchmark EGX 30 Index declined 0.6 percent.  Electrolux, the world’s second-biggest appliance maker,
said July 10 it will buy a 52 percent stake in Olympic from
Paradise Capital and offered to acquire the remaining shares of
the Cairo-based company for 40.6 pounds apiece.  To contact the reporter on this story:
