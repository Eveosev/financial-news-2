Cash premiums for U.S. soybeans
shipped in July to export terminals near  New Orleans  fell
relative to Chicago futures as export shipments slowed. The corn
spot-basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered this
month was 72 cents to 84 cents a bushel above August futures,
compared with 74 cents to 84 cents on July 22, U.S. Department
of Agriculture  data  show. The corn premium was 80 cents to 86
cents a bushel above September futures.  “Global grain buyers are facing economic issues and have
opted for cheaper soybeans from  South America ,” Karl Setzer, a
market analyst at  MaxYield Cooperative  based in West Bend,  Iowa ,
said in a report to clients today. “Even buyers who need to
import grain are taking smaller amounts and trying to stretch
inventories as much as possible.”  Soybean futures for August delivery dropped 14.75 cents, or
1.1 percent, to close at $13.655 a bushel on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest drop for the contract since June 30.  Corn futures for September delivery fell 11.25 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $6.7875 a bushel, the third decline in four
sessions.  The amount of corn inspected for export in the week ended
July 21 fell 18 percent to 35.301 million bushels compared with
the same week a year earlier, the USDA said today in a report.
Soybeans inspected for overseas shipments tumbled 29 percent to
5.158 million bushels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
