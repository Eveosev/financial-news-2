Malawi’s government plans to import
30 million liters of fuel to ease shortages that helped trigger
nationwide protests on July 20.  About 1.6 million liters of gasoline and 1.3 million liters
of diesel have already arrived, the  Malawi Energy Regulatory
Authority  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Fuel stocks “will continue to improve,” the regulator
said. “The Malawi government is taking all measures necessary
to ensure fuel product availability.”  President Bingu wa Mutharika said on July 20 that his
government has taken over importation of fuel because Petroleum
Importers Ltd. The company, owned by Puma Malawi Ltd., Chevron
Malawi Ltd, Petroda Malawi Ltd. and Total Malawi Ltd., was
failing to bring in enough supplies, the president said.  Chief Executive Officer Robert Mdeza was unavailable to
comment today.  Police clashed with tens of thousands of protesters on July
20 leading to the death of 18 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
