Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Nespresso unit won the
backing of a court that forced Swiss supermarket operator Denner
SA to stop selling rival Nespresso-compatible coffee capsules.  Denner will remove the capsules from store shelves, though
the supermarket will also consult with lawyers to explore ways
of reintroducing them, Denner said in a statement on its
 website .  The Swiss federal court ruled that a previous injunction
that prevented Denner from marketing the Nespresso-compatible
capsules should take effect again, Denner said. A local court in
 St. Gallen , Switzerland lifted that injunction in March. Denner,
a unit of Swiss retailer Migros, began selling the capsules at
the end of last year.  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE)  and Ethical Coffee Co. also started selling
their own versions of coffee for Nespresso machines in 2010,
offering consumers alternative pre-filled capsules for the first
time.  Julian Liew, a spokesman for Nespresso, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
