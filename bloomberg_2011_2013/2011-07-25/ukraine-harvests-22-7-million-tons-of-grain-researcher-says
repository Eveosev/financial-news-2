Ukraine reaped 22.7 million metric
tons of grain as of July 22 since harvesting began late last
month, UkrAgroConsult said.  Average yields advanced to 2.9 tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
from 2.4 tons a year earlier, the Kiev-based researcher said
today.  Barley accounted for 6.15 million tons and was reaped from
2.49 million hectares, or 66 percent of all areas planted with
the grain, UkrAgroConsult said. Average yields improved to 2.47
tons a hectare from 2.13 tons last year.  The wheat harvest reached 16 million tons, with average
yields climbing to 3.23 tons a hectare from 2.71 tons last year,
the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
