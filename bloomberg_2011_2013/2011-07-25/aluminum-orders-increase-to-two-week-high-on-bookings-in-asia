Orders to draw aluminum from
warehouses monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose to the
highest level in more than two weeks, led by increases in  South
Korea  and  Malaysia .  Canceled warrants, as the orders are known, rose 29,075
metric tons, or 7.7 percent, to 405,850 tons, the highest level
since July 7, exchange data showed today. A total of 20,625 tons
were canceled at Gwangyang, South Korea, while 15,475 tons were
booked at Johor. Aluminum stockpiles declined 10,325 tons to
4.38 million tons, the lowest since Jan. 10.  About 70 percent of stockpiled LME aluminum is tied to so-
called financing agreements and unavailable for immediate
consumption, according to Societe Generale SA. Financing accords
involve a simultaneous purchase of metal for nearby delivery and
a forward sale to take advantage of a market in contango, when
contracts with later delivery dates trade at higher prices than
nearer-dated metal.  Aluminum for immediate delivery on the LME traded at a
$29.60 discount to the three-month contract by 11:16 a.m. local
time.  The contango in forward aluminum prices has sometimes
exceeded storage costs over the last two years, with  interest
rates  at low levels and warehouse storage fees discounted in
some cases, analysts at Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a report
dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
