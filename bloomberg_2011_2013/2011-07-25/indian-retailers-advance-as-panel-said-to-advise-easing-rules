Pantaloon Retail Ltd. led Indian
retailers higher in Mumbai trading after a government panel was
said to have recommended easing rules that bar overseas
companies from the country’s retail industry.  Pantaloon,  India ’s largest listed retailer, rose as much as
8 percent, the biggest intraday gain in two months, while No. 2
Shoppers Stop Ltd. climbed as much as 8 percent to an intraday
record in Mumbai trading.  “Everyone expects some of the foreign guys to come in and
pick up stakes in some of these companies,” Sameer Narang, a
Mumbai-based analyst with HDFC Securities Ltd. said in a phone
interview.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ,  Carrefour SA (CA)  and other overseas
retailers may be allowed to own as much as 51 percent in multi
brand retail operations if they invest at least $100 million, a
government panel recommended on July 22, according to a finance
ministry official with direct knowledge of the matter. Retail
sales in India may grow to $785 billion in 2015 from an
estimated $396 billion this year,  according  to Business Monitor
International.  Pantaloon gained 8.6 rupees to 341.8 rupees and Shoppers
Stop rose 12.1 rupees to 479.7 rupees as of 11:20 a.m. in Mumbai
trading. Vishal Retail Ltd. rose 5.4 percent to 34 rupees after
earlier advancing as much as 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
