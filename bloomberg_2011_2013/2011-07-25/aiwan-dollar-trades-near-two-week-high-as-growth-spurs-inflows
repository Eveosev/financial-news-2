Taiwan’s dollar traded near a two-
week high on optimism the island’s expanding economy will
attract funds from abroad.  Government bonds  advanced.  The jobless rate held at about 4.4 percent for a fourth
month in June, the lowest it’s been since 2008, according to
government data released July 22. Economists predict figures
this week will show gross domestic product increased 4.4 percent
in the second quarter from a year earlier, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Global funds bought $172 million more Taiwanese shares
than they sold on July 22, according to exchange data.  The  Taiwan dollar  was at NT$28.826 against its U.S.
counterpart as of 10:10 a.m. local time, little changed from
last week’s closing level of NT$28.830, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.750 earlier, the strongest level
since July 11. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s
strength, declined 0.1 percent as U.S. lawmakers failed to agree
on raising the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt ceiling, boosting
the odds of a default as soon as next week.  “The greenback is weak today because of worries over the
U.S. debt problem,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “Concerns
surrounding the recoveries in developed economies will cause
global investors to shift money to  Asia , which has a brighter
outlook.”  Industrial Output  Taiwan is expected to report today that growth in
industrial production moderated to 6.7 percent in June from 7.8
percent the previous month, based on the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  The yield on the island’s 2 percent bonds due July 2016,
the most-traded government debt, fell one basis point to 1.20
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate
reached 1.21 percent on July 22, the highest level for a
benchmark five-year note since January 2009.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was unchanged at 0.375 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan  Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
