Zeti Akhtar Aziz,  Malaysia ’s central
bank governor, comments on inflation and food supply. She spoke
in Kuala Lumpur today.  “It is very important that we increase the supply of food
items, which is something that the government is directing a lot
of efforts. Also, improving the distribution of food items, and
assessing inputs into  food production  like fertilizers, feeds
and all these types of items from sources that are at lower
costs.  “All these efforts will rein in the amount of the rate at
which our inflation will increase. This is something we really
want to address so that it doesn’t undermine our future
prospects.  “That is very critical because in countries where
inflation rises without having any check, then we can see that
it will undermine the sustainability of our future growth.  “That is why a lot of attention is being focused now on
dealing with inflation because this erodes purchasing power.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
