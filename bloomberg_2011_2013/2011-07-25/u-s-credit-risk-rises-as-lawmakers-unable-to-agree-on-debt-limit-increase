A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk climbed by the most in 10 trading days as lawmakers debated
plans to raise the federal government’s debt limit before an
Aug. 2 deadline.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 2 basis points to a
mid-price of 94.6 basis points as of 4:39 p.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd.  The index of credit-default swaps, which typically rises as
investor confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, added
the most since July 11 after President  Barack Obama  and Congress
were unable to make a deal to raise the debt ceiling over the
weekend. Traders pushed the index up as concern grew that the
nation could lose its AAA credit rating.  “In some way, shape or form they need to get it sorted
out,” Rich Gordon, a fixed-income market strategist at  Wells
Fargo & Co . in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “A
rating downgrade is certainly a possibility.”  The benchmark fell 4.6 basis points last week as company
earnings beat expectations. Of 131 Standard & Poor’s 500
companies that have reported results, 107 performed better than
analysts expected, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting
$10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
