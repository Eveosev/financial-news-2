Russia ’s grain market is stable and
with 6.7 million metric tons of reserves the country doesn’t
need to impose export bans or quotas, President  Dmitry Medvedev 
said.  “I think it is enough,” Medvedev said today, speaking
about reserves at a meeting of agriculture officials in the
Tambov region of European Russia, according to a broadcast by
Rossiya 24 state-run TV channel. “It is the reserve, and we can
use it again when there is a sharp change in grain prices on the
world market.”  The country’s Grain Union estimated the crop to be between
89 million and 92 million tons, compared with “above 90 million
tons”, citing warm and wet weather and an encouraging harvest
in southern regions.  Russia may export 2 million tons of grain in July, Viktor
Zubkov, first deputy prime minister, said at the Tambov meeting,
Interfax news agency reported. He said Russia is exporting grain
to 33 countries.  Yelena Skrynnik, the agriculture minister, raised the grain
export forecast, for the second time in a week, to as much as 20
million tons in the current marketing year, at the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
