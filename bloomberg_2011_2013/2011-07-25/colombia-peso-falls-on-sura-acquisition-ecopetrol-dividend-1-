Colombia’s peso fell to a two-week
low as investors speculated that  Grupo de Inversiones
Suramericana SA (GRUPOSUR) , the parent company of Colombia’s biggest bank,
will buy dollars to pay for a $3.9 billion acquisition.  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 1,769.5 per dollar at 12:54
p.m. New York time, the weakest level since July 11, from
1,756.40 on July 22. The currency has jumped 9.1 percent since
March 1, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  ING Groep NV (ING)  agreed to sell most of its Latin American
insurance operations to Suramericana for about 2.7 billion euros
($3.9 billion). The sale includes ING’s pensions, life insurance
and investment management operations in  Chile , Colombia,  Mexico ,
Uruguay and Peru, Amsterdam-based ING said in a statement today.  “Suramericana will need dollars to make that big
transaction,” said Nicolas Bernal, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA. “The market is already factoring
that in.”  Demand for dollars also increased as  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) ,
Colombia’s biggest oil company, began paying shareholders its
second dividend payment of the year at 48 pesos a share, worth
1.9 trillion pesos ($1.1 billion), according to Bloomberg data.
The payment may also be weakening the peso as some recipients
convert the money to dollars, said Nicolas Bernal, an analyst at
Bogota-based brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.81 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.081
centavo to 117.487 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
