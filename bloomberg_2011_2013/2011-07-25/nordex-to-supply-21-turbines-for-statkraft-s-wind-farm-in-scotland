Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-power
developer, will supply 21 turbines to Norway’s Statkraft AS for
its 52.5-megawatt  Baillie wind farm  on the north coast of
 Scotland .  Nordex will install the 2.5-megawatt machines at the site
near Thurso in August 2012, the Hamburg-based company said today
in a statement, without disclosing terms. The wind park, a joint
venture between Statkraft and local developers, will provide
enough power to light about 39,000 households, Nordex said.  The U.K. has a binding European Union target to get at
least 15 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2020, a
sevenfold jump from 2008. Onshore wind projects may account for
about 15 percent of that goal, government data show. Statkraft,
 Europe ’s largest renewable-energy company, said in June it was
investing 250 million euros ($359 million) in two European wind
farms, including its 80 percent-owned Baillie project.  Nordex has already installed about 800 megawatts of
projects in Britain and Ireland, U.K. Managing Director Bryan Grinham said by telephone today from Manchester,  England .  The U.K. has commissioned about 4,000 megawatts of onshore
wind farms, putting it behind Germany, Spain and France,
according to London-based researcher  Bloomberg New Energy
Finance .  To contact the reporter on this story:
