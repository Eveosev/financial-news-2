Abdullah Mohamed Saleh, the chairman
of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, was named governor of
the Dubai International Financial Centre tax-free business park,
replacing Ahmed bin Humaid al Tayer.  The change is effective immediately, according to a
 statement  posted on the website of Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.  The Dubai Financial Service Authority is the regulator of
the DIFC, the Persian Gulf’s biggest financial center and home
to the regional offices of banks including Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Standard Chartered Plc. Dubai set up
DIFC in 2004 with its own regulations and an international stock
market to attract foreign banks, asset managers and insurers to
help diversify the economy.  Al Saleh became chairman of the DFSA in May 2007. He was
chairman of National Bank of Dubai PJSC, which until March that
year was the  United Arab Emirates ’ fourth-biggest bank by assets
before its merger with Emirates Bank International PJSC. The
combination of the two banks that year created  Emirates NBD
PJSC (EMIRATES) , the U.A.E.’s biggest bank.  Al Tayer, a former chairman of Emirates NBD and a U.A.E.
minister of state for finance and industry, was appointed
governor of the DIFC in November 2009. He was replaced as the
chairman of Emirates NBD in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
