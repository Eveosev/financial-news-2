Corn and soybean futures slumped the
most in three weeks on speculation that rain and cooler weather
will bolster crop development in the U.S., the world’s biggest
producer.  Some northern Midwest fields and parts of the South got as
much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain in the past three
days,  Commodity Weather Group LLC  said in a report. Commodity
prices eased after Congress and President  Barack Obama  failed to
reach a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  “Cooler and wetter weather in the central U.S. brought
temporary relief to heat-stressed crops,” Greg Grow, the
director of agribusiness at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The saga of U.S. debt-
ceiling talks encourages traders to reduce risk exposure.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 11 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $6.745 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the biggest drop since July 1. The price has jumped 75
percent in the past 12 months.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 16.25 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $13.72 a bushel, the biggest decline since
June 30. The oilseed has gained 40 percent in the past year.  Hot, dry weather will return by July 28 and continue the
following week, increasing stress on a third of the Midwest
crops, Bethesda, Maryland-based Commodity Weather Group said.  In the week ended July 17, an estimated 66 percent of the
U.S. corn crop was in good or excellent condition, down from 69
percent a week earlier, the government said last week. About 64
percent of soybeans got the top rankings, down from 66 percent.  “I expect both corn and soybean crop conditions to fall 2
percentage points” in the report scheduled for release after
the close of trading, Grow said. “August rains will be critical
for final yields.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
