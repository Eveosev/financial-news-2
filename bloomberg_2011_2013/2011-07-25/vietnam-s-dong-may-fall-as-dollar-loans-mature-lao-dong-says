Vietnam ’s dong may fall at the end
of this year when companies’ dollar loans come due, the Lao Dong
newspaper reported, citing Le Xuan Nghia, vice-chairman of the
National Financial Supervisory Commission.  Dollar loans jumped 23 percent in the first six months of
the year, compared with 3 percent for lending in dong, Lao Dong
said. Companies chose to borrow from banks in the U.S. currency
instead of dong because  interest rates  are much lower, it said.  Commercial banks charged borrowers as much as 8 percent for
dollar loans, compared with 25 percent for those in dong,
according to a statement on the central bank’s website July 19.  Policy makers may raise the compulsory reserve ratios for
dollars at banks to reduce lending, according to Lao Dong,
citing Nghia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
