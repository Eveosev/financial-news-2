Anders Behring Breivik, the man
detained for killing 93 people in a Norwegian shooting rampage
and bombing, said German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  should die
because she is a “multiculturalist,” Bild newspaper reported.  The threat is mentioned in the 1,500-page manifesto Breivik
posted online hours before the July 22 killings, the German
 newspaper  said. Like most German parties, Merkel’s  Christian
Democratic Union  is full of “cultural Marxists” and
“multiculturalists,” Bild cites the manifesto as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
