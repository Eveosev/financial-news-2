Al Rai Group Holding Ltd., based in
 Jordan , will invest 24 billion rubles ($866 million) in a grain
venture in  Russia ’s Bashkortostan region.  The company will refine 400,000 metric tons of grain a year
to produce gluten, starch and biopolymers, according to a
 statement  by the regional government today.  Al Rai will take an 85 percent interest in the venture,
while the government will hold the remaining 15 percent. The
Amman-based company will have to buy out Bashkortostan’s
interest three years after the refinery starts production.  Bashkortostan is Russia’s biggest oil-refining region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
