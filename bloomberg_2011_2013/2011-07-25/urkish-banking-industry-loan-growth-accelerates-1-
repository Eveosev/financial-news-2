Turkish bank loans grew a weekly 0.8
percent to 629.3 billion liras ($368 billion) in the week ending
July 15, reversing a contraction in the previous seven days, the
banking regulator said.  Annual growth in loans was 35.7 percent compared with 35.6
percent on July 8, the regulator in Ankara said on its website
today.  Turkey ’s central bank is seeking to slow loan growth to 25
percent annually by the end of the year to help stem the growth
in imports that’s widened the current account deficit to 9
percent of economic output in May, a record high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
