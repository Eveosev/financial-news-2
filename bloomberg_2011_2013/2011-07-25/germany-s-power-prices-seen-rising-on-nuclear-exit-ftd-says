Electricity prices in  Germany  may
rise by 175 euros ($250) a year for a household of three after
the phasing-out of nuclear power, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing a study by the  RWI research
institute .  The power price could rise by 5 cents per kilowatt-hour,
rather than the government’s estimated 1 cent, as a result of
the nuclear phase-out and greater reliance on alternative energy
sources such as wind and solar, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
