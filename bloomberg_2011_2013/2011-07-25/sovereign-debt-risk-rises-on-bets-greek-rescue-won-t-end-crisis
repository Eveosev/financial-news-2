The cost of insuring against default
on sovereign and corporate debt rose for the first time in five
days on concern  Greece ’s rescue may not end  Europe ’s crisis as
the U.S. struggles to break a stalemate on its budget.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments increased 6 basis points to
265.5 at 3:30 p.m. in London. Swaps on U.S. Treasuries rose 3 to
56, according to CMA, signaling deteriorating perceptions of
 credit quality .  Investors are betting Greece’s second bailout in 15 months
won’t be enough to stop the crisis from spreading to the rest of
the euro area as Moody’s Investors Service cut the nation’s
credit rating to its second-lowest grade. Concern the U.S. may
lose its AAA ranking even if lawmakers reach a plan to avoid
default next week also weighed on confidence.  “A new outbreak of contagion remains a very real risk,”
said  Bill Blain , co-head of strategy at broker Newedge Group in
London. Last week’s rescue “stemmed immediate fears of Greek
catastrophe and contagion overwhelming Italy and  Spain . But
there remain nagging doubts.”  Credit-default swaps on Greece fell 5 basis points to
1,590, adding to last week’s decline from a record 2,568 basis
points July 18, CMA prices show.  Swaps on Italy increased 15 basis points to 270, Spain
climbed 17 to 327 and Portugal rose 12 to 919, while Belgium was
7 higher at 172 and Ireland was unchanged at 875, according to
CMA.  ‘Last-Minute Deal’  Contracts on U.S. Treasuries are approaching the highest
level in 17 months. They’re still half the record 100 basis
points set in February 2009.  “Markets are still pricing in their expectation that a
last-minute deal will be reached,” said  Philip Gisdakis , a
Munich-based strategist at UniCredit SpA. “In the case of no
deal, the wider economic implications would be disastrous.”  Greece’s financing package will consist of 109 billion
euros ($157 billion) from the euro region nations and the
 International Monetary Fund . Financial institutions will
contribute 50 billion euros through a series of bond exchanges
and buybacks to cut Europe’s biggest-debt load.  Swaps on the Netherlands jumped 7 basis points to 53,
Austria rose 10 to 86 and Denmark climbed 7 to 66, according to
CMA. Norway increased 3 to 27.5, Finland was 5 higher at 45 and
 France  was up 9 at 112, while  Germany  rose 3 to 60.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 10 basis points to 171 and the
subordinated index jumped 16 to 300, according to JPMorgan Chase
& Co.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 14
basis points to 428. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose 3.75 basis points
to 114.75 basis points.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
