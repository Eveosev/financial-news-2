Following is the text detailing
forecasts for percentage changes in annual food prices,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture :  Analysis and Forecasts of the CPI for Food:  In 2011, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all food is
projected to increase 3 to 4 percent. Food-at-home (grocery
store) prices are forecast to rise 3.5 to 4.5 percent, while
food-away-from-home (restaurant) prices are forecast to increase
3 to 4 percent. Although food price inflation was relatively
weak for most of 2009 and 2010, cost pressures on wholesale and
retail food prices due to higher food commodity and energy
prices, along with strengthening global food demand, have pushed
inflation projections for 2011 upward.  The all-food CPI increased 0.8 percent between 2009 and 2010,
the lowest food inflation rate since 1962. Food-at-home prices
increased by 0.3 percent--the lowest annual increase since 1967-
-with cereal and bakery product prices declining 0.8 percent and
processed fruit and vegetable prices dropping 1.3 percent. Food-
away-from-home prices rose 1.3 percent in 2010, the lowest
annual increase for restaurant prices since 1955.  For 2012, food inflation is expected to abate from 2011 levels
but remain slightly above the long-term historical average of
the past two decades. The all-food CPI is projected to increase
2.5 to 3.5 percent over 2011 levels, with food-at-home prices
increasing 3 to 4 percent and food-away-from-home prices
increasing 2 to 3 percent. While many inflationary pressures
that drove prices up in 2011 are not expected to intensify and
may even decrease in 2012, retailers have been slow to pass on
cost increases to date. Price levels in 2012 will hinge
significantly on weather conditions in the American Midwest
during the remainder of July and into August and September 2011.
Because current USDA forecasts are based on a normal weather
scenario, sustained heat or drought conditions resulting in
reduced supplies and intensified inflationary pressure would
result in revised USDA forecasts.  June 2011 Prices (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  The CPI for all food increased 0.2 percent from May to June
2011, 0.4 percent from April to May 2011, and is now 3.7 percent
above the June 2010 level. The food-at-home CPI increased 0.1
percent in June 2011 and is up 4.7 percent from last June, while
the food-away-from-home index was up 0.3 percent in June 2011
and is 2.3 percent above last June. Food commodity and energy
price increases over the past year, combined with a weak  U.S.
dollar , have caused most of the recent increases in grocery
store prices. The all-items CPI was down 0.1 percent in June and
is 3.6 percent above the June 2010 level.  Beef prices decreased 0.7 percent in June and are 8.2 percent
above last June, with steak prices up 4.0 percent and ground
beef prices up 11.0 percent. Pork prices increased 0.5 percent
in June and are 8.5 percent above last June’s level. Poultry
prices increased 0.3 percent in June and are 3.0 percent above
prices last year at this time, with chicken prices up 2.1
percent and other poultry prices (including turkey) up 6.6
percent. Due to higher input costs, beef and pork prices are now
significantly higher than in 2010. The beef and pork industries
also downsized their inventories during the high price inflation
of 2007-08, and the supply of these commodities remains low
relative to demand. These factors are reflected in ERS’s
forecasts--beef prices are now projected to increase 7 to 8
percent and pork prices 6.5 to 7.5 percent in 2011.  Egg prices decreased 1.3 percent in June 2011; however, egg
prices remain high and are now 11.1 percent above the June 2010
level.  Fish and seafood prices were up 0.7 percent from May to June
2011 and are 8.2 percent above the June 2010 level. Rising feed
prices, in conjunction with shocks to the global market due to
recent Japanese supply disruptions, have led to fish and seafood
prices that are considerably higher than 2010 levels.  Dairy prices were up 0.5 percent from May to June 2011, compared
with a 0.8-percent increase from April to May 2011. Dairy prices
are now 7.2 percent above the June 2010 level. Within the dairy
category, prices changed as follows in June: milk prices were up
0.4 percent and are 10.2 percent above last June’s prices;
cheese prices were up 0.5 percent and are 6.9 percent above last
June’s level; ice cream and related product prices were up 0.8
percent and are 6.6 percent above last June’s level; and butter
prices decreased 0.9 percent this month and are 21.7 percent
above last June. In 2010, dairy prices were up only 1.1 percent
from 2009 (following a 6.4-percent decline from 2008 to 2009).
Due to higher projected prices for farm milk in 2011, ERS
forecasts that retail dairy prices will increase 5 to 6 percent
over 2010.  Fresh fruit prices decreased 2.0 percent in June, and the fresh
fruit index is up 1.8 percent overall from last year at this
time, with apple prices down 0.3 percent, banana prices up 5.8
percent, citrus fruit prices down 1.9 percent, and other fresh
fruit prices up 2.8 percent. The fresh vegetable index decreased
1.6 percent in June, due in large part to a seasonal shift away
from those crops affected by harsh winter weather. Since last
year at this time, fresh vegetable prices are up 5.8 percent,
with potato prices up 11.6 percent, lettuce prices up 3.2
percent, tomato prices up 10.9 percent, and other fresh
vegetable prices up 2.9 percent from this time last year.
Processed fruit and vegetable prices increased 0.7 percent in
June and are 1.6 percent above the June 2010 level. Because
price inflation within the processed fruit and vegetable
industry has been well below that for fresh fruits and
vegetables, ERS has revised its forecast for processed fruits
and vegetables downward to 1.5 to 2.5 percent over 2010.  Cereal and bakery product prices were up 0.5 percent from May to
June 2011 and are up 4.1 percent from last year at this time,
with bread prices up 5.3 percent and breakfast cereal prices up
5.2 percent over the past year. Although cereal and bakery
product prices declined 0.8 percent overall in 2010, higher
wheat commodity costs should begin to affect cereal and bakery
product prices over the next few months, causing prices to rise
3.5 to 4.5 percent overall in 2011. Sugar and sweets prices were
up 1.2 percent in June and are 4.0 percent above last June.
Within the nonalcoholic beverages category, prices changed as
follows in June: carbonated drink prices were up 0.7 percent and
are up 3.4 percent from June 2010; coffee prices were up 1.7
percent and are up 17.6 percent from last June; and nonfrozen
noncarbonated juices and drinks prices were down 0.5 percent in
June and are up 0.5 percent from the June 2010 level.  The index for fats and oils was up 1.1 percent from May to June
2011 and is 9.7 percent above the June 2010 level. The
significant price increase over 2010 is due in large part to
surging soybean prices.  What’s Behind the Forecasts:  ERS regularly updates and provides food price forecasts for the
short-term period of 12 to 18 months. These forecasts are a
composite of formal model results and judgment. Monthly Bureau
of Labor Statistics’ indexes for all food, food away from home,
food at home, and 15 food at home categories are used in
conjunction with ERS analysis to adjust the current short-term
forecasts for each of the food categories. See ERS data on the
CPI for food and CPI forecasts.  ERS food price forecasts are developed through a three-step
process:  * First, USDA develops its 10-year baseline projections. The
baseline provides long run projections for the agricultural
sector and covers agricultural commodities, agricultural trade,
and aggregate indicators of the sector, including farm income
and food prices. The baseline projections are a conditional
scenario with no shocks and are based on specific assumptions
regarding the macroeconomy, agricultural policy, the weather,
and international developments. In particular, the baseline
incorporates provisions of the Farm Security and Rural
Investment Act of 2002 (2002 Farm Act) and assumes that current
farm legislation remains in effect through the projections
period. For the actual projections, see the USDA Agricultural
Baseline Projections Briefing Room.  * In the second step, ERS analysts develop the short-term
forecasts that incorporate the most recent baseline assumptions
and current information on market conditions and expectations,
weather patterns, commodity prices and supplies, and expected
consumer demand for specific foods.  * In the third step, these short-term forecasts are compared
with a computer-based Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average
(ARIMA) model that determines whether the ERS short-term
forecast falls within an expected statistical range of a 95-
percent confidence interval.  Food price forecasts developed using this three-step process are
subject to revision if the conditions on which they are based
should change significantly. Projections could be affected by
changes, for example, in the feed grain crop outlook; in export
markets, especially for meat items; in nonfarm markets; or in
weather-related crop conditions in major fresh fruit and
vegetable growing areas.  Historical data indicate that fresh fruits and vegetables and
egg prices are the most volatile food prices that ERS tracks.
Grain price changes affect the price of meats, poultry, eggs,
and dairy products more than the prices of other food items and
to a lesser extent cereals and bakery products. Because these
items account for more than half of the at-home food dollar,
price changes for these categories can significantly affect the
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI) for food at home.  SOURCE:  U.S. Department of Agriculture  To contact the reporter on this story:
