The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose 49.54, or 0.2 percent, to 32,065.84 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg, after declining 0.8 percent last week.  The following are among the most active stocks in the South
African market today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, closed at its lowest in a week, dropping 3.01 rand, or
1.2 percent, to 259.79 rand. BHP workers voted yesterday to
extend their strike at the Escondida copper mine in  Chile , the
world’s largest. Stoppages at BHP’s Australian steelmaking coal
operations may resume this week.  Cashbuild Ltd. (CSB)  , a building-materials retailer,
advanced to its highest in almost two weeks, gaining 30 cents,
or 0.3 percent, to 92.50 rand. Revenue increased 5 percent in
the three months to June compared with the same period a year
earlier, the company said in an operational update.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest
producer, rose the most in a week, advancing 1.19 rand, or 1.1
percent, to 106.98 rand. Gold rallied to a new high,
strengthening as much as 1.5 percent to $1,624.07 an ounce, as
U.S. lawmakers failed at the weekend to reach an agreement on
raising the federal debt limit, boosting demand for the metal as
a haven investment on concern that the government of world’s
largest economy may default next week.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  , the operator of the world’s
deepest platinum mine, rose for the first day in four, advancing
72 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 39.72 rand. The company and the
 National Union of Mineworkers  will resume wage talks, mediated
by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration,
on Aug. 3, Zwelitsha Tantsi, a negotiator for the union said by
phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
