Ghana ’s cedi may strengthen to a
two-month high by the close of trading this week, as offshore
investors buy the currency to pay for the country’s first
auction of five-year bonds since 2007.  The cedi is likely to gain to 1.5064 per dollar, Kevin Adarkwa, a currency trader at the local unit of Standard
Chartered Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today. That
would be the strongest closing level since May 31. The currency
gained as much as 0.3 percent today to 1.5068 per dollar before
trading unchanged at 1.5110 by 2:26 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg News. So far this month
the cedi is up 0.3 percent from 1.5158 at the end of June.  “We should see increasing activity from offshore investors
selling dollars on the market as we move closer to the auction
day,” Adarkwa said. “The dollar sales by the offshore
investors should enable the cedi to gain at least 0.3 percent by
the close of trading on Friday, from last Friday’s closing
level.”  The  Bank of Ghana  will offer 300 million cedis ($198.5
million) of five-year bonds on July 28, it said in a prospectus
on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
