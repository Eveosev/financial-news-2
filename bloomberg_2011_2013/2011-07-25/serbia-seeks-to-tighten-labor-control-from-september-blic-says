Serbia will step up inspections of
employers who fail to report workers as the state plans a new
crackdown on the grey economy in September,  Blic  newspaper
reported, citing Deputy Prime Minister Verica Kalanovic.  A recent government incentive for employers to legalize
their unreported hires sparked little response, the newspaper
said. The government will tighten control because there may be
as many as 1 million unreported workers in the country of 7.5
million people, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
