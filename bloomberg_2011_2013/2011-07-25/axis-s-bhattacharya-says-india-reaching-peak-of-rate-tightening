Saugata Bhattacharya, a Mumbai-based
economist at Axis Bank Ltd., comments on  India ’s monetary
policy. He spoke today in a phone interview.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. The rest expect no change.  “Our sense is that we are very near the peak of the
tightening cycle. We expect a 25-basis point increase and a
hawkish tone in the statement, but an emphasis on global
conditions determining policy ahead will be a de facto signal of
a pause in rate hikes.  “The RBI is likely to project India’s inflation rate at
around 6 percent to 6.5 percent at the end of March 2012, with 8
percent to 8.5 percent growth.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
