South African bonds declined,
lifting yields from six-week lows, before tomorrow’s debt
auction as concern the U.S. won’t agree on a debt ceiling
extension sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is offering 2.1 billion
rand ($310 million) of bonds maturing in 2020 and 2041 at its
weekly auction of fixed-interest debt, according to the central
bank’s data on Bloomberg. The yield on the 2020 bonds rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.27 percent today in
the secondary market at 2:30 p.m. in Johannesburg after falling
to 8.24 percent on June 22, the lowest since June 9. The bonds
yielded 8.43 percent at the previous auction on July 12.  Republican lawmakers prepared to force action on a shorter-
term extension of the U.S. debt ceiling than President  Barack
Obama  has requested, increasing the risk of a default. Risk-
averse investors shed emerging-market assets, stalling a rally
that drove the yield on the 2020 bonds down 19 basis points
since July 18.  “After a strong rally by local bonds last week, upward
momentum is weak and we expect to see local bonds come under
pressure to pare gains in the week ahead,” Tradition Analytics
researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in
a research note today.  South Africa  sold 2.1 billion rand of 2017 and 2021 bonds
at the central bank auction on July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
