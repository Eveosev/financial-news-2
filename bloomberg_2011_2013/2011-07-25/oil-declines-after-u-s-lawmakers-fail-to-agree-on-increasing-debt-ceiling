Oil fell for the first time in five
days after President  Barack Obama  and Congress failed to agree
on raising the U.S. debt ceiling, boosting concern that the
government will default and damage the world’s largest economy.  Futures tumbled from a six-week high as Republicans and
Democrats prepared dueling plans on how to tackle the country’s
$14.3 trillion debt and quell fears of a default on Aug. 2.
 Standard & Poor’s  has warned there is a 50 percent chance it
will lower the U.S. government’s AAA credit rating.  “Everything is so focused on the U.S. debt ceiling that
there isn’t much more to the movement in crude than that,” said
 Matt Smith , a commodities analyst for Summit Energy Services
Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. “We weren’t able to push through
$100 last week, so unless we see some sort of resolution, we’re
going to continue to be choppy this week with an emphasis to the
downside.”  Crude for September delivery dropped 67 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $99.20 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices have increased 26 percent in the past year.
They touched $100.19 a barrel in intraday trading on July 22,
the highest level since June 10.  Brent oil for September settlement fell 73 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $117.94 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract traded at a
premium of $18.74 a barrel to U.S. futures, compared with a
record close of $22.63 on July 14.  Breakdown in Talks  Any debt-limit increase must pass both the Republican-
controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate and be signed by
Obama. Democrats have resisted cuts to entitlement programs such
as Social Security and Medicare and called for higher taxes,
while Republicans have insisted a debt ceiling be accompanied by
corresponding spending cuts and no tax increases.  Talks between the two parties broke down on July 22.  “For the financial investors, if the debt issue is not
really resolved, they may cut a portion of their risky assets,”
said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Co. in
 Tokyo . “Crude oil is a kind of risky asset, so people may cut a
part of their portfolio.”  Even if Congress raises the limit in time to avert a
default, Standard & Poor’s might lower the U.S. AAA sovereign
credit rating to AA+ with a negative outlook if a deal isn’t
accompanied by a “credible solution” on the debt burden, it
said in a report July 21.  U.S. equities and commodities dropped on the debt concern.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped from a two-week high,
losing 0.5 percent to 1,338.75 at 3:06 p.m. in New York. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  fell 77.09 points, or 0.6 percent, to
12,604.07.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
dropped 0.6 percent to 697.09 after reaching a six-week high on
July 22. Eighteen of the commodities declined.  Greek Downgrade  Oil also fell after  Greece ’s long-term foreign currency
debt was cut three steps today by Moody’s Investors Service,
which said the European Union’s bailout of the country will
cause substantial losses for investors and amount to a default.  Greece’s debt was downgraded to Ca, Moody’s second-lowest
rating, from Caa1, the company said in a statement in  London 
today. Moody’s said it will reassess the risk profile of any
outstanding or new securities issued by Greece after the debt
exchange that’s part of the new rescue plan has been completed.  Europe ’s Crisis  Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, which started in Greece and
spread to  Portugal  before threatening Italy and  Spain , reined in
 oil prices  in May and June because of the threat to the European
economy and subsequent declines in the euro. A weaker euro curbs
the appeal of commodities as an alternative investment.  The euro was little changed at $1.4377 at 3:07 p.m. in New
York from $1.436 on July 22.  Prices may rise as the biggest bet in the oil options
market has become a 20 percent increase to $120 by the end of
the year as global growth drives demand for raw materials, based
on Nymex data compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of contracts held by traders in options to buy
 New York  futures at $120 a barrel in December totaled 45,502
lots on the exchange as of July 21, 4,226 lots more than the
next-highest wager, which is for $125. Open interest in the two
contracts jumped 29 percent in the past four weeks, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hedge funds  raised net-long positions in New York-traded
crude by 8 percent to 182,285 in the week ended July 19,
according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s weekly
Commitments of Traders report. Money managers raised bullish
bets on  Brent crude  by 11 percent in the week ended July 19,
according to data from ICE Futures Europe.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 371,308
contracts as of 3:08 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 461,564
contracts July 22, 31 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.5 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
