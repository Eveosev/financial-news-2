Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the mail-order and
online film-rental service, forecast third-quarter sales and
profit that fell short of analysts’ projections as a price
increase cuts new-user signups. The shares dropped.  Profit this quarter will be 72 cents to $1.07 a share,  Los
Gatos , California-based Netflix said today in a statement
online. Sales will be as much as $828.5 million. Analysts were
projecting profit of $1.11 a share on sales of $842.9 million.  Because of the price change, the company expects to sign
401,000 new domestic subscribers this quarter, a fraction of the
1.8 million added in the period just ended. Netflix split its
mail-order and streaming services into two plans, effectively
raising prices by 60 percent to $15.98 a month for people who
want both DVDs and online access.  “Netflix miscalculated on this one, and are basically
saying all our growth is going to be absorbed by people who
quit,” said  Michael Pachter , an analyst at Wedbush Securities
in  Los Angeles  who had an “underperform” rating on the stock.
“It’s not clear how successful they’re going to be at
attracting and retaining people with these new pricing plans.”  Netflix fell $29.03, or 10 percent, to $252.50 in extended
trading. The shares rose $4.95 to $281.53 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The company said it had
24.6 million customers at the end of June.  Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said on a conference
call he “feels bad” some customers are upset. Users of the
online service will enjoy “the amazing new content we will be
able to license” with money from the increase, he said.  Wean Them Away  The majority of Netflix’s U.S. customers now purchase the
streaming and mail-order plan that Hastings has been trying for
the past few months to wean them away from, he said.  “We’re convinced we can thrive on streaming only,”
Hastings said.  Second-quarter net income rose 55 percent to $68 million,
or $1.26 a share, from $43.5 million, or 80 cents, a year
earlier, Netflix said. Analysts predicted $1.12 a share, the
average of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Sales gained 52 percent to $789 million in the period,
compared with analysts’ projections of $790.5 million.  The company signed up 1.96 million new users, boosting the
total to 25.6 million worldwide, according to the statement.  Netflix is expanding its online business to  Latin America 
and the Caribbean this year. Mexico City-based TV Azteca SAB
today announced a three-year deal to supply 1,000 to 1,500 hours
of Spanish-language programming annually starting in September.  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. is in talks to offer Netflix
exclusive streaming rights, replacing a pay-TV accord with  HBO ,
a person with knowledge of the situation said July 23. Hastings
declined comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
