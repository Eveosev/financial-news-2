Innovation Network Corp.  of  Japan 
will spend $680 million for a stake in Landis+Gyr AG, the
biggest investment so far by the government-backed fund that
started two years ago.  INCJ, based in Tokyo, will purchase a 40 percent stake in
the Swiss electronic-metering company, and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  will
buy the remaining 60 percent in a joint acquisition, according
to separate statements from the companies today.  Toshiba, Japan’s biggest maker of nuclear reactors, agreed
in May to acquire Zug, Switzerland-based Landis+Gyr for $2.3
billion in cash and assumed debt to bolster its smart-grid
operations. The transaction will be completed by the end of the
month as scheduled, Toshiba said in a statement.  Founded in 1896, Landis+Gyr makes so-called smart meters
that allow utilities to check energy use remotely and can be
connected to equipment that shows customers when rates are
highest. Its clients include E.ON AG, Centrica Plc’s British Gas
unit and PG&E Corp.  INCJ, which was created in July 2009 to facilitate
innovations and growth of new businesses, earlier announced 15
transactions totaling 59 billion yen. INCJ can invest up to 800
billion yen ($10 billion) with support from the government and
private companies.  The total cost of acquisition of the smart-meter maker for
Toshiba will be $1.6 billion, the company said in the statement
to the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
