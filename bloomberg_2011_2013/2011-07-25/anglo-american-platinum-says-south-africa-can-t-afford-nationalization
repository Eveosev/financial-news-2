South Africa “can’t afford” to
take over the country’s mines, regardless of a debate within the
ruling political party over nationalization, Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Neville Nicolau said.  “I’m sure the nationalization debate will not result in
the nationalization of mines,” Nicolau, head of the largest
platinum producer, said in an interview in Johannesburg today.
It “doesn’t make any sense. The country can’t afford it.”  Almost all the mines of Amplats, as the producer is known,
are in South Africa, which has the richest of any reserves. The
company, controlled by  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , produces about 40
percent of the world’s platinum. Julius Malema, leader of the
ruling African National Congress’s youth league, wants the state
to take over mines, banks and farms to redistribute wealth to
black people disadvantaged under apartheid, which ended in 1994.  “The underlying problem is unemployment of youth in this
country,” Nicolau said. That’s “a much more pressing and
important national issue than the nationalization debate.”
Unemployment is about 25 percent in South Africa.  South Africa risks cutting mine output as the debate deters
investors that provide funding to mining companies,  Impala
Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  CEO David Brown said last month. It is
jeopardizing job creation,  Mark Cutifani , head of  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the third-largest gold producer, said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
