Billionaire Phil Anschutz’s AEG
Worldwide will shoulder a bigger share of the costs to build a
downtown  Los Angeles  football stadium project than originally
proposed, according to a report released today by the city.  The project, if approved, would be the second NFL stadium
out of the 23 built since 1992 to be financed entirely by
private funds, according to the report. AEG would earn an
estimated 6.7 percent annual return, less than half the rate of
a typical stadium developer, it said.  AEG, owner of the Staples Center basketball arena, has
proposed putting the stadium on an adjacent site and bringing a
National Football League team back to Los Angeles, the second-
largest U.S. city. AEG has made concessions including paying for
parking garages in an effort to win over city officials.  “This is a significantly different deal than the one that
was given us,” City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said
in an interview.  The City Council is holding public hearings on the plan
this week, and is expected to vote in August.  To contact the reporters on this story:
