The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said a July 26 report of export sales of 200,000 metric tons of
corn to  Japan  was incorrect. The sale was for 170,000 tons, the
USDA said today in an e-mailed message. The corn is for delivery
in the 2011-2012 marketing year, which begins Sept. 1, the USDA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
