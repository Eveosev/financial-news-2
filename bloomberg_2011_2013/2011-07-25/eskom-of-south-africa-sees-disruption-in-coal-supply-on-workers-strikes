Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd.,  South
Africa ’s power utility, has started seeing disruptions in coal
supplies from some mines because of a nationwide strike by
workers, spokesman Tony Stott said.  The company has a coal stockpile for 38 days and doesn’t
want this to fall below 20 to 28 days, Stott said by phone from
Johannesburg today. Eskom is concerned that workers at mines
where management has already concluded wage agreements may join
the industrial action in a so-called sympathy strike, he said.  If the strike is protracted, Eskom’s contingency plans will
come “under severe strain,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
