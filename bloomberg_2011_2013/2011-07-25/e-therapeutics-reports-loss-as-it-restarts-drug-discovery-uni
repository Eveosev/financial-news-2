E-Therapeutics Plc (ETX) , the U.K.
drugmaker that issued almost 17 million pounds ($28 million) of
new shares in March, lost more money for a second year as it
worked to bring four medicines closer to clinical trials.  The loss for the 12 months ended Jan. 31 widened to 2.3
million pounds from 1.8 million pounds a year earlier, the
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England-based company said today in a
statement. E-Therapeutics had no revenue for a second year.  The drugmaker raised 16.6 million pounds in March after
shares surged 45 percent to restart its drug discovery unit near
Oxford,  England , and to prepare four treatments, including one
to kill malignant cancer cells, for human testing next year. E-
Therapeutics is also in talks with larger drugmakers, said Chief
Executive Officer Malcolm Young. He declined to say which
companies.  “It’s our principle priority to partner with much larger
pharmaceutical companies,” said Young, who expects the
discovery unit to identify a new drug in six to nine months, in
a phone interview. “The sort of core financials don’t capture
where we are at all.”  E-Therapeutics, which uses molecular databases to help it
decide on which drugs may succeed in testing, has returned 4.3
percent in the past year. Shares were unchanged at 36.5 pence at
10:30 a.m. in London trading. The drug developer has a market
value of 50 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
