Export growth in Asia-Pacific
developing economies may slow in 2011 to about half of last
year’s pace, the  United Nations  said.  The expansion in shipments may moderate to 9 percent this
year from 17.3 percent in 2010 as the U.S.,  Europe  and  Japan  all
face an economic slowdown in the medium-to-long term, the UN
said in a report released today in Bangkok.  Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis, climbing U.S. unemployment
and the impact of Japan’s March earthquake threaten to slow the
Asia-led global recovery from the 2009 recession. The risks have
eroded investor confidence, wiping more than $1 trillion off
stocks worldwide since the beginning of May.  It’s unlikely that the economies of  Asia  and the Pacific
“can completely decouple” from the rest of the world because
many of the economies of the region have been “deeply integrated
into global production chains,” the UN said in the report. Still,
recent trends indicate the region is “becoming more resilient to
external shocks and maintaining the growth trajectory.”  While the Asia-Pacific’s exports to the rest of the world
“roughly” doubled between 2000 and 2009, intraregional exports
rose almost 2.5 times, the report said.  Foreign direct investment to the Asia-Pacific region has
recovered after the global financial crisis, the UN said.
Investment into  Southeast Asia  doubled in 2010 after declining
19 percent in 2009.  Malaysia’s FDI jumped to $8.6 billion in 2010 from $1.4
billion in 2009, according to the report. Indonesia’s FDI more
than doubled to $12.7 billion in 2010, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
