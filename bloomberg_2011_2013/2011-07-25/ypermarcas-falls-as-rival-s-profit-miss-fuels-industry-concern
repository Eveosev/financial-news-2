Brazilian consumer-goods maker
 Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  fell, extending the second-worst performance on
the Bovespa index this year, after a rival’s unexpected profit
drop cast pessimism on the industry’s growth prospects.  Hypermarcas,  Brazil ’s fifth-largest consumer-goods company
by market value, slipped 3.2 percent to 12.55 reais at 4:15 p.m.
New York time. The stock slumped 44 percent this year, compared
to a 13 decline for the Bovespa.  Natura Cosmeticos SA, Latin America’s biggest maker of
cosmetics, said last week second-quarter net income fell 1.8
percent to 188.1 million reais ($122 million), missing the
average estimate of 212.8 million reais among eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose at the slowest pace since
2007. That may foreshadow poor sales performance for
Hypermarcas, which is scheduled to report earnings Aug. 15, said
 Raymond James  & Associates Inc.  “There may be some overhang for shares in Hypermarcas in
the short term,”  Daniela Bretthauer  and Marina Braga, analysts
at Raymond James, wrote in a note to clients today. Hypermarcas
is unlikely to present “any significant recovery” in second-
quarter earnings compared to the first quarter of this year,
they wrote.  Hypermarcas, which the analysts rate “market perform,”
had first-quarter net income of 32.9 million reais, a 40 percent
decline from a year earlier. Shares plunged 11 percent after the
earnings report, the most since October 2008. Analysts expect
Hypermarcas to post second-quarter profit of 109.2 million
reais, according to the average of five estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
