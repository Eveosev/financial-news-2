OAO Polyus Gold,  Russia â€™s biggest
gold producer, advanced for the first time in six days as the
precious metal rallied to a record.  The stock surged 4 percent to 1,639.1 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, after slumping 13 percent last week.  Gold futures climbed to a record $1,624.30 an ounce as U.S.
lawmakers failed to reach an agreement on raising the federal
debt limit, boosting demand for the metal as a haven investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
