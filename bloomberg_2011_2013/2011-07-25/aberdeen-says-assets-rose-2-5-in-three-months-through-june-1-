Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) , a
Scottish  fund manager , said assets under management rose 2.5
percent in the three months through June, helped by inflows into
its equities funds.  Assets climbed to 185.8 billion pounds ($303 billion) from
181.2 billion pounds in the previous quarter, the Aberdeen-based
firm said in a statement today. Clients added 2.6 billion pounds
to the company’s equities funds in the period.  “Aberdeen continues to make good progress in what have
been volatile market conditions,” Chief Executive Officer
Martin Gilbert said in the statement. “Flows into higher-margin
products have more than offset redemptions in terms of revenue,
ensuring profit, cash flow and margins remain strong.”  Aberdeen joins rival U.K. asset manager Henderson Group Plc
in reporting growth in assets under management. Aberdeen
“continues to see healthy” equity product inflows, “supported
by the long-term performance track records,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
