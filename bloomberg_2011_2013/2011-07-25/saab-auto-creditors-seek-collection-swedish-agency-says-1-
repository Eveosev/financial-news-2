Sweden’s Debt Enforcement Agency has
been asked by eight companies to collect debts owed to them by
 Saab Automobile , the Swedish carmaker forced to halt production
amid a cash shortage.  “We will start the collection process in a few days,”
Christina Lindberg, a case worker at the agency, said today by
telephone.  The companies that have requested the agency to enforce
debts include Kongsberg Automotive AB, a Norwegian company that
makes car-seat parts, according to a document provided by the
enforcement agency. Lindberg said she didn’t know the total
amount that Saab owes.  Saab was forced to halt production in April because of a
cash shortage. The company is negotiating payment and delivery
terms with suppliers and aims to restart manufacturing in the
week of Aug. 29, it said July 21.  “We have discussions with all the suppliers to resolve
this as soon as possible,”  Eric Geers , a Saab spokesman, said
by telephone today. “We have come far in the discussions.”  Last week, another supplier, SwePart Verktyg, asked a
Swedish district court to put Saab’s tools unit in bankruptcy
after it had failed to pay a debt. Saab then said it resolved
the issue by reaching a payment agreement with that company.  Swedish Automobile NV, Saab’s Dutch owner, fell as much as
8.8 percent and was down 4.2 percent, or 7.3 cents, at 1.68
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in Amsterdam.  In total, 104 debts from Saab have been registered with the
collection agency, Lindberg said. Some companies have filed more
than one debt claim, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
