Canadian National Railway Co. (CNI) , the
biggest Canadian railroad based on annual sales, posted second-
quarter profit that topped analysts’ estimates after freight
rates rose amid higher shipping demand.  Profit climbed to C$538 million ($569 million), or C$1.18 a
share, from a year earlier, the Montreal-based company said in a
statement. Earnings per share excluding a net deferred income
tax expense were C$1.26, beating the C$1.25 average of 26
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Class 1 railroads, the largest North American carriers
based on annual revenue, are raising prices as demand for
freight increases, according to Bloomberg analysis. U.S. rail
companies  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP) ,  CSX Corp. (CSX)  and  Kansas City
Southern (KSU)  last week reported rate increases during the quarter.  Canadian National  posted “continued improvements in
freight volumes,” Chief Executive Officer Claude Mongeau said
in the statement. The company’s intermodal segment “was a
bright spot, benefiting principally from higher import
volumes.”  The company reiterated its full-year profit forecast of as
much as 15 percent growth in adjusted earnings per share.  Net income in the same period last year was C$534 million,
or C$1.13 a share.  Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) , the second-largest Canadian
railroad, reports earnings on July 27 before the start of
regular  New York  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
