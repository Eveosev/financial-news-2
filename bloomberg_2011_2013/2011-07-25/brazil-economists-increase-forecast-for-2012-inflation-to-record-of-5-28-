Economists covering the Brazilian
economy raised their 2012 inflation forecast to its highest ever
for that year, after the central bank last week signaled it may
soon halt the cycle of interest rate increases that began in
January.  Consumer prices will rise 5.28 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in a July 22  central bank survey  of
economists published today. The figure was up from 5.20 percent
the previous week and from 4.5 percent in January.  “This is basically saying that the central bank won’t do
enough,”  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based economist covering
 Latin America  for 4Cast Inc., said in a telephone interview.
“They don’t want to harm growth, so they are going to take a
long time to bring inflation to the center of the target.”  The central bank raised its benchmark lending rate for a
fifth straight meeting last week, after inflation accelerated to
a six-year high in mid-July. In a statement accompanying the
decision, policy makers withdrew a commitment to raise rates for
a “sufficiently long” period, leading traders to increase bets
that the bank will hold the rate unchanged at 12.50 percent for
the rest of year.  The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  Played Down  A government official in President Dilma Rousseff’s
economic team played down the worsening of inflation
expectations, saying that it was a result of just 11 analysts
out of 110 increasing their forecast for consumer price
increases next year. Of the analysts surveyed by the central
bank, eight cut their 2012 forecast, said the official, who
asked not be identified since he is not authorized to speak
publicly about the survey.  Economists held their prediction for 2011 inflation
unchanged. Prices, as measured by the IPCA index, will rise 6.31
percent this year, the survey found.  Economists raised their forecast for the benchmark  interest
rate  to 12.75 percent next year, from a week earlier forecast of
12.63 percent. In contrast to traders, economists expect the
central bank to raise the Selic rate once more this year, by a
quarter point at its August policy meeting.  Consumer prices rose 6.75 percent in the year through mid-
July. The central bank aims to slow inflation back to the
midpoint of its target in 2012.  Economists held their forecasts for economic growth at 3.94
percent this year, and 4.0 percent in 2012.  Brazil ’s government seeks a “soft landing” that brings
inflation under control without halting economic expansion,
Rousseff told Sao Paulo-based Valor Economico newspaper in an
interview July 22.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 12.70 percent at 1:11 p.m.
New York time. The real appreciated 0.9 percent to 1.5379
against the  U.S. dollar , its strongest level since 1999.  To contact the reporters on this story:
