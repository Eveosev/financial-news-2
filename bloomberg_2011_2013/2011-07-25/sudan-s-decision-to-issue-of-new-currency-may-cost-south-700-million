Sudan ’s decision to introduce a new
currency will cost newly independent South Sudan as much as $700
million, the secretary-general of the south’s ruling party,
 Pagan Amum , said.  Prior its independence on July 9, South Sudan and Sudan
shared the Sudanese pound. South Sudanese officials said the
government planned for a two-month switchover to a new currency
and that about 2 billion old Sudanese pounds were in circulation
in the south.  “The implication of the introduction of a new currency in
the north is that the Sudanese pound is being made an illegal
tender, with the Bank of Sudan not assuming responsibility for
this currency which they have issued,” Amum told reporters
today in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.   South Sudan released its own currency on July 18 and the
authorities in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, followed with the
distribution of their new currency on July 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
