The 77 U.K. banks and building
societies too small to have been included in the European Union
stress tests have about 939 million pounds ($1.35 billion) of
Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish sovereign and
financial institution debt.  The lenders also have about 62 million pounds of  government
bonds  from those countries, the U.K.’s  Financial Services
Authority  said in a statement posted on its website today. In
addition, the 77 have about 3.5 billion pounds of investments in
the European Economic Area, which includes the 27 EU countries
plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and  Norway , the FSA said.  Barclays Plc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Lloyds Banking Group Plc held about 22.8 billion
euros of government securities in troubled euro-member states,
the lenders disclosed as part of the European Banking
Authority’s stress tests earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
