Ivory Coast ’s president,  Alassane Ouattara , named Francis Wodie as head of the Constitutional
Council, replacing Paul Yao N’Dre, said spokesman Massere Toure.  N’Dre, who was appointed as head of the council by then-
President Laurent Gbagbo in 2009, nullified 600,000 votes in
northern Ivory Coast after a November presidential election
runoff.  That move sparked a violent 4 1/2-month political impasse
as it altered the outcome of the poll in favor of incumbent
Gbagbo. Ouattara had been declared winner by the country’s
electoral commission, a move that the Constitutional Council
overruled.  Wodie was a candidate for the small opposition Ivorian
Workers’ Party in the first round of the election. Gbagbo was
captured in  Abidjan  in April and Ouattara installed as president
a month later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
