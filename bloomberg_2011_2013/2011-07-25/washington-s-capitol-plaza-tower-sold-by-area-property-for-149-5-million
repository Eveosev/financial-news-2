Area Property Partners LP and Van
Ness Property Group sold the Capitol Plaza office tower in
 Washington , D.C., to Principal Real Estate Investors LLC for
$149.5 million.  The 291,838-square-foot (27,113-square-meter) property is
98 percent leased, Area said today in a statement. The building
was vacant when the New York-based investment company and its
partner acquired it in 2007.  “This is one of the pre-eminent office properties in a
growing submarket with limited class A office product,” Jim
Halliwell, managing director at Principal Real Estate Investors,
said in the statement.  Commercial real estate values in Washington are rising from
their recession lows. Office-building prices in the city gained
6.1 percent in May from a year earlier, the Moody’s/REAL
Commercial Property Price Index showed. Values gained the most
among six major U.S. markets last year as employers added jobs,
according to CoStar Group Inc.  Capitol Plaza tenants include Washington public schools,
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Department of  Homeland
Security .  Area Property Partners’ funds have invested in more than
500 transactions valued at more than $60 billion, according to
the statement. Principal Real Estate Investors, a unit of  Des
Moines , Iowa-based  Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , manages or
subadvises $37.3 billion in commercial real estate assets.  Cassidy Turley represented Area and Van Ness Property Group
in the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
