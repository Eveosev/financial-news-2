Indranil Pan, chief economist at
Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, comments on  India ’s monetary
policy in a report released today.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will raise its benchmark
repurchase rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.75 percent at
a policy review tomorrow, according to 20 of 22 economists in a
Bloomberg survey. Two expect no change.  “There has not been any change in the inflation trajectory
from June 16, 2011 onwards, when the RBI increased the repo rate
by 25 basis points. There is little reason to imagine the RBI
would suddenly pull its feet off the accelerator and pause in
the policy.  “The rhetoric from the RBI is also unlikely to be dovish.
Our own inflation estimates indicate that on a provisional basis,
headline wholesale-price index inflation could peak at 9.8
percent in August with no further oil-price hikes. History
suggests the RBI pauses on a rate-hiking cycle only after the
peak for inflation is visible.  “We retain our call for another 25-basis point increase in
the repo rate to be delivered by the close of the first half of
fiscal year 2012.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
