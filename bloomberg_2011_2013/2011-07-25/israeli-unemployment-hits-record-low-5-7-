Israel ’s unemployment rate declined
to a record low of 5.7 percent in May as the economy expanded.  The jobless rate dropped from 5.8 percent in the previous
month, preliminary  data  released today by the Central Bureau of
Statistics in  Jerusalem  showed. Unemployment in May last year
was 6.5 percent.  “Consumer spending and manufacturing are continuing to
grow,” said Yaniv Hevron, head of macro-strategy at Excellence
Nessuah Investment House Ltd. in Ramat Gan, Israel. “Employers
feel comfortable and sufficiently confident to continue
hiring.”  Israel’s economy is likely to expand 5.2 percent this year
the Bank of Israel said on June 1, more than twice the rate
forecast by the  International Monetary Fund  for the U.S. and the
Euro zone. Governor  Stanley Fischer  has been gradually raising
the benchmark rate, from a record low of 0.5 percent in August
2009 to 3.25 percent, as the economy recovers from the global
recession.  Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said a month ago that the
5.8 percent unemployment rate reported for April was a record
low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
