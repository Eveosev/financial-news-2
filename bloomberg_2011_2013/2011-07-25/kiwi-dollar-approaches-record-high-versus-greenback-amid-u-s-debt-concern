The Australian dollar fell against
the yen and Swiss franc as stocks dropped amid concern U.S.
President Barack Obama and Congress will fail to agree on
raising the federal debt limit.  The Aussie also declined after Moody’s Investors Service
cut  Greece ’s sovereign credit rating and said the European
Union’s financing package for the nation implies “substantial
economic losses” for private creditors. New Zealand’s currency
traded at almost a record high versus the greenback before the
central meets on July 28 amid speculation Governor Alan Bollard
will signal  interest rates  will increase this year.  “The deadline for the U.S. debt ceiling is approaching and
the solution still remains quite elusive so there’s potentially
some risk around currencies as that date looms large,” said
 Besa Deda , chief economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in Sydney.
Australia’s currency will remain under pressure against the yen
and Swiss franc as  risk aversion  emerges, she said.  Australia’s currency fell 0.1 percent to 85.20 yen at 12:46
p.m. in  New York  from 85.23 last week. It rose 0.2 percent
against the dollar at $1.0872. The Aussie fell 1.4 percent
against the Swiss franc to 87.66 centimes.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.3 percent to 86.69 U.S. cents
from 86.45 on July 22, when it touched 86.75 cents, the most
since it was freely floated in 1985. The kiwi traded at 67.92
yen from 67.91.  Republicans and Democrats pushed dueling plans for raising
the U.S. debt ceiling to avert a default. House Speaker  John Boehner , an Ohio Republican, prepared to force action on a
shorter-term extension of the U.S. debt limit than Obama has
requested, defying a veto threat and the administration’s
warnings of dire economic consequences. Treasury officials
project the debt limit will be exhausted Aug. 2.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks fell 0.9 percent. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
