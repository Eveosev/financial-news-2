India ’s crude oil output rose for
the 19th straight month in June as  Oil India Ltd. (OINL)  and non-state
companies including  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  boosted production.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 3.2 million
metric tons of oil last month, a 7.7 percent increase from a
year earlier, the  oil ministry  said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 34 percent to
877,800 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, where Cairn India
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, more than
doubled to 524,100 tons, according to the data. Cairn India
started the field in August 2009.  Oil India, the second-biggest state-run crude producer,
reported a 20 percent increase in output to 315,800 tons,
according to the statement.  Output by state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s
largest energy explorer, fell 2.4 percent to 1.97 million tons,
the ministry said.  ONGC’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.4 million tons, a
decline of 5.5 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for about 44
percent of India’s oil production.  Natural gas output in India fell for the seventh straight
month, declining 11.7 percent to 3.98 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by market
value, cut gas production from the KG-D6 block off the nation’s
east coast to about 48 million cubic meters a day from about 60
million cubic meters a year earlier because of a drop in
pressure, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said July
8. Output may rise in 2013, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
