Belgian business confidence dropped
for a fourth consecutive month in July and declined more than
economists forecast as executives in the manufacturing industry
signaled a contraction of output amid falling demand.  The confidence index for  Belgium  fell to minus 2.5 from
minus 1.1 in June, the  National Bank of Belgium  in Brussels said
today in an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a drop to
minus 2.1, the median of 11 forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The economic downturn in the manufacturing industry,
observed since the second quarter of this year, has led to a
drop in the production capacity utilization rate, the first for
two years,” the central bank said in the statement. “The
business climate also weakened in the building industry and in
the trade sector.”  A sub-index assessing the production rate in the
manufacturing industry tumbled to minus 14.6, the lowest reading
in more than two years, from 10.4 in June. The capacity
utilization rate dropped to less than 80 percent for the first
time since the fourth quarter of last year. A gauge of demand
expectations in the  construction industry  declined to minus 3.6,
the lowest value in 11 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
