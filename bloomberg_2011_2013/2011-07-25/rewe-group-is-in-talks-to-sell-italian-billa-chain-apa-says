Rewe Group,  Germany ’s second-largest
food retailer, is in talks to sell its Italian Billa supermarket
chain to Conad Soc Coop, the  APA   news agency  reported today,
citing Francesco Puglies, general director of Conad.  Conad, which is based in Bologna, Italy, is in talks with
Cologne-based Rewe and will soon make an offer for the 200 Billa
stores in the country, APA said. Conad can spend 1.5 billion

Esselunga are also interested in acquiring Billa, according to
APA. Phone calls and e-mails to Rewe in Germany and  Austria 
seeking comment weren’t answered. A spokesman for Conad declined
