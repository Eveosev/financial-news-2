Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by  Barclays Plc (BARC) , said it loaned 30 million rand
($3.1 million) to First Strut Ltd., which went into liquidation
earlier this month.  “It’s very small,” Stephen van Coller, head of
Johannesburg-based Absa’s investment-banking unit, said in a
telephone interview today. The bank’s provisions for bad debts
would cover any losses from the loan, he said.  First Strut, a South African manufacturer supplying the
transport, mining and power industries, was placed in
provisional liquidation on July 16, said John Louw, a business
rescue practitioner appointed for the 5,000-person firm. First
Strut has 925 million rand of floating-rate notes outstanding,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Investec Plc (INVP)  said earlier this week that its 240 million-rand loan to First Strut was “fully secured on underlying
collateral which is predominantly property.”  South African financial services companies, including Rand
Merchant Bank,  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , Sanlam Ltd.,  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) 
and  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , plus its fund manager Stanlib,
have declined to comment on how much money they have at risk
through First Strut, citing “client confidentiality.”  First Strut went into liquidation after the murder of
Chairman Jeff Wiggill last month in Soweto, southwest of
Johannesburg. Wiggill’s shooting was a “hit,” the
Johannesburg-based  Star  reported today, citing the bail
application of one of the men arrested for his killing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
