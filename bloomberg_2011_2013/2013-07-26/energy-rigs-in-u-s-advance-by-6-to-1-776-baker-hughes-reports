Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S.
increased by six to 1,776 this week, according to  Baker Hughes
Inc. (BHI)  The advance was the fourth in a row.  Oil rigs  rose six to 1,401, the Houston-based field
services company said on its website. Gas rigs were unchanged at
369. The total U.S. count reached the highest level since March
15. Rising output from U.S. shale formations have boosted
domestic oil production to a 22-year high.  “We are increasingly confident that the U.S. land recovery
is poised to accelerate in the second half of the year,” James C. West, oil services and drilling analyst for  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s
investment-banking unit in New York, said in a research note
July 23. “Demand for well services has been stealthily
increasing in recent months.”  Natural gas for August delivery fell 7 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $3.574 per million British thermal units at 1:08
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , up 15 percent from a
year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 41 billion cubic feet last week
to 2.786 trillion, smaller than the five-year seasonal average
increase of 53 billion, the Energy Information Administration
said yesterday. Supplies were 12.5 percent below year-earlier
levels.  U.S. oil output climbed to 7.56 million barrels last week,
the most since December 1990, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s statistical unit. Stockpiles slipped to 364.2
million barrels.  Crude for September delivery dropped $1.05, or 1 percent,
to $104.44 today on the Nymex, up 17 percent in the past year.  Oil prices  are “well above levels” at which exploration
and production companies would consider significantly raising
their  capital spending  in the second half of this year, West
said.  “We think recent positive data regarding U.S. land
activity is a clear signal to the market that operators are
putting capital to work and a sustained uptick in activity is
under way,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
