The  Chicago Blackhawks  signed coach
Joel Quenneville to a three-year contract extension after
winning their second Stanley Cup in the five seasons he’s led
the team.  Quenneville, the only active National Hockey League coach
with two championships, signed a deal that will keep him with
the franchise through the 2016-17 season, the Blackhawks said on
their  website . Financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Quenneville, 54, is 222-106-44 with the Blackhawks, who
posted a 36-7-5 record last season after starting the lockout-shortened campaign 21-0-3. His 660 career wins in parts of 16
seasons ranks sixth in NHL history.  Chicago beat the  Boston Bruins  in six games to capture the
Stanley Cup in June, scoring two goals in the final 76 seconds
for the championship-clinching 3-2 win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
