The Czech government approved a
draft law to end support for renewable energy, proposing to stop
subsidies for new projects at the end of this year.  The plan was adopted during an extraordinary cabinet
session yesterday and is subject to approval by parliament, the
government said in a statement on its website.  Subsidies for renewable-power sources, particularly solar
plants, have raised prices for Czech energy users in the past
three years as the cost is passed on through customer bills.  “The reason for this law amendment is the rising financial
burden for electricity consumers,” Prime Minister Jiri Rusnok
said in the statement. “It threatens the competitiveness of our
industry and raises consumers’ uncertainty about power prices.”  Only hydro, wind and biomass power plants that got
construction permits this year will be eligible for support if
they’re completed before the end of 2014, the statement shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
