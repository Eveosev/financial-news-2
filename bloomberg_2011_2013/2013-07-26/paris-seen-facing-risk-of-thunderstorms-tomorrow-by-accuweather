Paris will be at risk of
“powerful” thunderstorms tomorrow as an area from the
Netherlands to southwest  France  faces downpours, high winds and
hail, said AccuWeather Inc.  The area of storm risk will shift east the next day to
cover most of Germany as well as eastern France and Switzerland,
the  State College , Pennsylvania-based forecaster wrote in an
 online report .  The storms will form as a cold front from the Atlantic
Ocean dislodges a mass of hot air originating from northwest
Africa, AccuWeather wrote. Thunderstorms with wind and hail
damaged vineyards in the Burgundy wine region in eastern France
this week.  “The worst of these storms will have potential to damage
property,” AccuWeather said. “Sunday, the threat area will
shift eastward along with the cold front. Strong, gusty
thunderstorms could reach Berlin by Sunday evening.”  While  London  may get thunder and lightning tomorrow and
rain might fall across much of England, storms affecting the
U.K. are unlikely to be severe, according to the forecaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
