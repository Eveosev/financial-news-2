Swiss stocks  declined to a three
week low, dragging the benchmark Swiss Market Index to a second
straight week of losses, as investors awaited a U.S. report on
consumer sentiment.  Noble Biocare Holding AG slid 4.2 percent after UBS AG
downgraded its recommendation on the maker of dental implants.
 Novartis AG (NOVN)  fell 0.8 percent.  Galenica AG (GALN)  surged 7.7 percent
after winning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for its Injectafer drug to treat anemia.  The  SMI (SMI)  slid 0.3 percent to 7,841.21 at 10:33 a.m. in
Zurich. The index has dropped 1.1 percent this week, heading for
its biggest decline in more than a month. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also fell 0.3 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 25 percent less than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S, economists  forecast  a final reading of 84 for
the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary index of
consumer sentiment in July. The preliminary reading was 83.9,
down from 84.1 in June. The report is due at 9:55 a.m.  New York
