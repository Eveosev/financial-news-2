Mexico’s peso fell, extending its
weekly decline, as improving U.S. economic data fueled
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will reduce a stimulus
program that has buoyed the Latin American nation’s securities.  The currency dropped 0.8 percent to 12.7085 per  U.S. dollar 
at 10:29 a.m. in Mexico City, widening its loss this week to 1.4
percent, the biggest since the five days ended June 21. The peso
is up 1.2 percent this year, the best performance among major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “It’s still the Fed driving everything,”  Eduardo Suarez ,
a Latin America strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia , said in a
telephone interview from Toronto.  Mexican policy makers were unanimous in their decision on
July 12 to leave the target lending rate at a record low 4
percent as inflation eased and the Fed signaled it may begin to
withdraw stimulus, minutes published today show.  The peso fell today as the Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of U.S. consumer sentiment advanced in July
to 85.1, a six-year high. The Fed will trim its monthly bond
buying to $65 billion in September from the current $85 billion,
according to half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg from
July 18 to 22, up from 44 percent last month.  The yield on government peso bonds due in 2024 climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.92 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign holdings of fixed-rate peso bonds surged to a
record high earlier this year as investors tried to escape near-zero rates at home by buying the higher-yielding securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
