Iron ore entered a bull market after
 China  replenished inventories and boosted steel output.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to Tianjin
gained 0.4 percent to $132.60 a ton, the highest since April 30,
according to data from The Steel Index Ltd. The  price  has
rebounded from the low of $110.40 on May 31, meeting the common
definition of a bull market for a climb of more than 20 percent.  The rally, which will bolster earnings at producers
including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , may be short-lived as banks from
Citigroup Inc. to UBS AG forecast that prices will drop as
miners ramp up supply. Morgan Stanley predicts a return to a
global surplus in 2014, the first since 2010. Ore delivered to
the Chinese port city entered a bear market in May on concern
slowing growth in the world’s biggest buyer would curb demand.  “China’s steel production has been stronger than expected
in the first half of the year, at a time when the big iron ore
supply increase has not come through yet,” said Michele della Vigna, managing director of natural resources equity research at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  London . “Over the coming 12-18
months, there’s a huge amount of iron ore production coming on
stream that is likely to turn the market into oversupply.”  Stockpiles at Chinese ports rebounded from 66.26 million
tons on March 8, the lowest since March 2009, to 71.67 million
tons on July 12, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Port holdings climbed 5.1 percent in the second
quarter, the biggest three-month gain in two years.  China’s Production  China’s first-half crude-steel output rose 7.4 percent to
390 million tons, the National Bureau of Statistics said July
15. Ore imports rose 5.1 percent to 384.3 million tons in the
first half from a year earlier, customs data show. Exports from
 Australia ’s Port Hedland, the world’s biggest bulk terminal, hit
a record in May, with China’s purchases at an all-time high.  “The drivers behind the extension of iron ore’s short-covering rally are, we believe, idiosyncratic rather than
representative of underlying strength,” Credit Suisse Group AG
analysts led by Ric Deverell said in a July 16 report. Short-covering refers to investors reversing bets on losses. “We
maintain our view that bearish fundamentals will reassert
themselves” through the second half, they said.  China’s economy grew 7.5 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier, slowing for a second straight period. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. cut its 2013 growth estimate to 7.4 percent, joining
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Barclays Plc in
predicting the weakest growth since 1990.  Seaborne Supply  Global seaborne supply may increase 6 percent this year and
15 percent next year, driven by increases from Rio Tinto Group
and  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) , UBS said on July 9. The bank
forecasts that prices may drop as low as $70 this quarter. That
would be the lowest level since June 2009.  Citigroup forecasts that prices will average $115 a ton
this half, while Macquarie Group Ltd. expects an average of
$120. In the first six months, ore averaged $136.97.  Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  said in a July 16 report that the
third quarter tends to be seasonally weak for iron ore demand.  A repeat of the slump last September, when ore fell to a
three-year low of $86.70, is unlikely this year amid low
inventories at steel mills and ports in China, according to
Morgan Stanley. Prices will average $128 a ton this quarter and
$125 in the final three months, it says.  The global seaborne market will swing from a deficit of
91.5 million tons this year to a surplus of 8.8 million tons in
2014, increasing to 69.1 million tons in 2015 and 152 million
tons in 2017, according to a Morgan Stanley report on June 25.
Iron ore is the biggest seaborne cargo after oil.  Australia, Brazil  Rio Tinto (RIO)  said July 16 that second-quarter iron ore
production rose 7 percent to 51.8 million tons from a year
earlier. The expansion of its Australian operations to 290
million tons of annual capacity is on track to start this
quarter, it said. BHP, the world’s biggest mining company, said
July 17 that its fourth-quarter iron ore production gained 17
percent, pushing annual output to a 13th straight record.  Australia and  Brazil  are the biggest exporters, accounting
for about 78 percent of global seaborne supply last year,
according to Morgan Stanley. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale SA is the
world’s biggest shipper followed by Rio Tinto and BHP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
