Canada ’s budget deficit widened in
the first two months of the fiscal year as slower than expected
inflation damped revenue growth.  The federal government ran a deficit of C$2.71 billion
($2.63 billion) in April and May, compared with a two-month gap
of C$1.82 billion a year ago, the finance department said in an
e-mailed statement. Revenue grew 1.4 percent, less than half the
3.4 percent increase in total expenses.  Inflation this year has been slower than policy makers
predicted as the country’s economy struggles to build momentum,
crimping revenue from price-sensitive levies such as the  sales
tax . Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty ’s annual budget, released in
March, projected inflation of 1.3 percent this year, along with
a deficit shrinking to C$18.7 billion, from C$25.9 billion last
year.  The  Bank of Canada  last week lowered the average of its
quarterly forecasts for price increases this year to 1 percent.  Revenue from the country’s goods and services tax fell 7.7
percent during the two-month period to C$4.89 billion. Income
tax gains rose 2 percent to C$25.8 billion.  Total revenue was up 1.4 percent to C$41.8 billion,
including an 8.2 percent increase in employment insurance
premiums.  Total expenditures rose to C$44.5 billion, driven by a 3.6
percent gain in program expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
