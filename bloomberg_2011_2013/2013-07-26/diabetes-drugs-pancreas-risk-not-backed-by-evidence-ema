A European Medicines Agency
committee didn’t find enough evidence to support scientists’
concerns that a class of diabetes drugs known as GLP-1s affect
pancreatic cell growth, the regulator said today.  “Available data do not confirm recent concerns over an
increased risk of pancreatic adverse events with these
medicines,” the London-based agency said in a  statement . The
EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP,
had started its review of the therapies in March.  GLP-1-based medicines approved for use in the European
Union include Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.’s Byetta,  Novo Nordisk
A/S (NOVOB) ’s Victoza and Merck & Co.’s Januvia. Researchers at the
 University of California ,  Los Angeles  found increased pre-cancerous changes in diabetes patients using this class of
drugs, the Washington-based public advocacy group  Public Citizen 
said when the research was published.  The CHMP reviewed the evidence, consulted experts and
determined that the study had limitations, potential sources of
bias and other factors that prevented “a meaningful
interpretation of the results,” the EMA said. The committee
concluded that there was no change in the evidence for risks of
harm to the pancreas from using GLP-1 drugs.  The increase in Type 2 diabetes cases represents a “major
public health challenge,” the regulator said. Manufacturers of
the diabetes treatments “are closely monitoring for adverse
effects, including effects on the pancreas, and report their
findings regularly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
