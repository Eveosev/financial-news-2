Japanese  shares  fell, with the Topix
index headed toward its first weekly drop in six weeks, as paper
and tire makers led declines and after exporters slid as the yen
held gains against the dollar.  Oji Holdings Corp.,  Japan ’s biggest paper company, lost 4.1
percent. Tiremaker Bridgestone Corp. sank 3.4 percent. Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, lost 2.2 percent.
Chip-equipment maker Advantest Corp. tumbled 6.6 percent after
posting a 3.6 billion yen ($36 million) loss. CyberAgent Inc.

income.  The Topix slid 1.8 percent to 1,180.56 as of 9:17 a.m. in
 Tokyo , with all 33 industry groups falling. The index is on
course for a 2.6 percent decline this week, its first weekly
drop since June 14. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined 1.9
percent to 14,282.66.  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the  Topix (TPX)  rebounded amid optimism Abe will push through reforms
after winning upper-house elections on July 21. The gauge added
15 percent in the five weeks through July 19, the biggest such
advance since April 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
