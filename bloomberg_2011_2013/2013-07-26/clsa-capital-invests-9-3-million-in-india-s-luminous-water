Luminous Water Technologies Pvt., an
Indian water company, today said it has raised 550 million
rupees ($9.3 million) through investments by Hong Kong-based
CLSA Capital Partners.  CLSA Capital Partners has invested in the Indian company,
based in Gurgaon, near New Delhi, through its unit Aria
Investments Partners IV, the Hong Kong-based company said in an
e-mailed statement.  The funds were received in a single tranche and will help
Luminous Water, which is owned by the  SAR Group , expand its
 Livpure  brand of reverse osmosis water purifier, Raja Mohanty, a
spokesman for the group, said by telephone today.  India , the world’s second-most populous nation, plans to
spend $20 billion over five years on water treatment, irrigation
and recycling to improve supplies. Each year, diarrhea spread
through unclean water  kills  about 400,000 children younger than
five years old, according to UNICEF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
