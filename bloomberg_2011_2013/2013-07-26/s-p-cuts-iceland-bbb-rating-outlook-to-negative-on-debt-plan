Standard & Poor’s  cut the outlook on
Iceland’s BBB- credit rating, citing concerns that the nation’s
plans to forgive  household debt  could put pressure on public
finances.  The outlook was cut to negative from stable, S&P said in a
statement today. A ratings cut would push Iceland’s credit grade
to junk.  “We believe that the contemplated household debt
forgiveness could pose a significant fiscal risk to Iceland,”
S&P said in a statement. “Depending on the scope of the write-down and the mode of financing, general government debt could
rise substantially.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
