(Corrects writedown in headline and first paragraph.)  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the second-largest gold producer, reported a surprise loss after taking a
$1.77 billion writedown on the value of stockpiles and two
Australian mines following a slump in bullion prices.  The second-quarter net loss was $2.02 billion, or $4.06 a
share, compared with net income of $279 million, or 56 cents, a
year earlier, the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based miner said
today in a  statement . The loss, excluding impairments and other
one-time items, was 10 cents a share, compared with the average
of 17  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg for a profit of 42 cents.  Gold mining companies have announced at least $15 billion
of writedowns in the past two months after the precious metal’s
steepest quarterly drop in more than nine decades.  Newcrest
Mining Ltd. (NCM)  said June 7 it may take a charge of as much as A$6
billion ($5.6 billion) and  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the biggest gold
producer by market value, said yesterday it took a writedown on
the value of assets of $1.96 billion.  The second-quarter results were released after the close of
regular trading in  New York , where Newmont rose 1.1 percent to
$29.93.  Newmont said it was taking impairment charges on its
Boddington and Tanami mines in  Australia , and writing down the
value of stockpiles and ore on leach pads.  The producer said it reduced spending by $362 million this
year, from the first half of 2012, to lower costs. “We are also
on track to reduce our corporate work force by more than one
third,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg said in the
statement.  Job Cuts  About 80 jobs, including some vacant positions, from a
workforce of 1,870 will be cut by the end of September at the
Boddington mine in  Western Australia , the company said today in
a separate statement.  Newmont said second-quarter sales fell to $1.99 billion
from $2.23 billion. The average of seven estimates was for $2.09
billion.  Gold futures in New York rose 0.7 percent to settle at
$1,329.50 an ounce yesterday. The metal has dropped 31 percent
from a record $1,923.70 in September 2011.  (Newmont scheduled a conference call for 10 a.m. New York
