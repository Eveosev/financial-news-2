Rice stockpiles in  Japan  swelled 26
percent to the highest level in 11 years at the end of June as
higher prices weakened demand from local  food industry , the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said today.  Inventories of Japanese food rice held by local producers
and distributors increased to 2.26 million metric tons as of
June 30 from 1.80 million tons a year earlier, the ministry said
in a report. Volume is expected to increase further to 2.31
million tons at the end of June 2014, the highest level since at
least 1999, according to the report.  Wholesale prices of Japanese food rice averaged 16,442 yen
($167) a bag in May, 6.7 percent higher than a year ago,
according to the ministry. One bag contains 60 kilograms.  Japan, the worldâ€™s largest corn importer, grows enough rice
to feed itself as the government maintains high tariffs on
imports and pays subsidies to growers.  The government set its production target for food rice at
7.91 million tons this year, down 0.3 percent from 2012, as it
attempts to balance output with domestic demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
