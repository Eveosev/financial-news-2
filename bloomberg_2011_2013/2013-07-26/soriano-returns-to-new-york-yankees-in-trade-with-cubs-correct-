Alfonso Soriano went hitless in five
at-bats in his return to the  New York Yankees  almost a decade
after being traded for  Alex Rodriguez .  Soriano struck out in his first three appearances, then
reached base as he hit into a fielder’s choice that saw David
Adams out at second in the eighth inning of the Yankees’ 10-6
loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. He later scored on a double by
catcher Chris Stewart.  In the ninth inning, the leftfielder again hit into a
fielder’s choice, scoring  Brett Gardner  while Adams was again
forced out at second.  The Chicago Cubs received pitching prospect Corey Black in
return for Soriano, a 37-year-old outfielder, the Yankees said
in a statement. Soriano is owed about $25 million for the final
year of a $136 million, eight-year deal that expires after next
season, MLB.com said. The Cubs will pick up $17.7 million,
according to ESPN.com.  The Yankees wanted to sign Soriano before Major League
Baseball’s July 31 trade deadline because of a lack of hitting
power caused by injuries. Soriano has eight home runs in July,
one more than the entire Yankees team.  New York  ranks 24th of 30 major-league teams with 88 home
runs this season after leading the majors with 245 homers in
2012. The Yankees’ 395 runs rank 22nd after finishing second in
that category last year with 804.  The Yankees have been without players including  Derek Jeter 
and Rodriguez this season.  Curtis Granderson , who hit a team-high 43 home runs last year, and  Mark Teixeira , who had 24
homers, are also on the disabled list.  Low Production  The Yankees are fourth in the five-team American League
East with a 54-49 mark, seven games behind the division-leading
Tampa Bay Rays. New York has made the playoffs all but one year
since 1995, and has won five World Series championships in that
span.  Soriano is batting .251 this season with 17 home runs and
52 runs batted in. During his 15-year career, which began in
1999 with the Yankees, he has a .272 batting average with 389
home runs, 1,989 hits and 1,087 RBI.  The Yankees traded Soriano to the  Texas Rangers  for
Rodriguez on Feb. 2, 2004. He played two seasons with the
Rangers and one for the Washington Nationals before joining the
Cubs in November 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
