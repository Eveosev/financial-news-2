  Tunisia ’s  Interior Ministry  said
Islamic extremists killed secular opposition leader Mohamed
Brahmi yesterday with the same semi-automatic weapon used to
assassinate a political ally earlier this year.  “This information surprised us,” Lotfi Ben Jeddou told
reporters in Tunis today. Boubaker Hakim, a Salafist radical
accused of smuggling arms from  Libya , is being sought in
connection with both killings, he said.  Ben Jeddou urged hundreds of opposition supporters
protesting in Tunis not to attack government buildings and to
avoid violence. Most flights in and out of the country were
grounded today while many shops and public buildings in the
capital were shuttered.  Brahmi, secretary-general of the nationalist People’s
Movement party, will be buried tomorrow at the Jalaz cemetery
close to the grave of Cukri Beleid, who was assassinated in
February.  President Moncef Marzouki ordered preparations for a state
funeral amid concern Brahmi’s death could deepen a rift between
secularists and Islamists. The shooting of Beleid sent thousands
into the streets in protest, causing a political crisis that
brought down Islamist Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali.  The government blamed Beleid’s assassination on Islamic
extremists while the opposition said the authorities were
responsible.  To contact the reporter on this story:
