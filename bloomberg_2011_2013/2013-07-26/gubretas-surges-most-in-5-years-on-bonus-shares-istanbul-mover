Gubre Fabrikalari TAS (GUBRF) , a Turkish
maker of fertilizers, rallied the most in more than four years
as it plans to boost capital by distributing bonus shares.  Gubretas, as the company is known, soared 13 percent, the
most since May 2009, to 16 liras at the close in Istanbul,
bringing the three-day gain to 14 percent. More than 7.4 million
shares changed hands, about 17 times the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark
 Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index slumped 1.8 percent, extending
its weekly decline to 4.4 percent.  “Normally, a bonus issue should not have much effect on
the share price,” Ilyas Safa Urganci, an analyst at Is
Investment in Istanbul, said by phone today. “Investors are
probably buying as they think liquidity of the stock will
increase.”  Istanbul-based Gubretas said yesterday it plans to
quadruple capital to 334 million liras ($174 million). The
capital will be added from provisions as the company distributes
three bonus shares per share to investors, it said. The stock
has rallied 13 percent this year, compared with a decline of 7.2
percent for the benchmark index.  Gubretas posted a 42 percent drop in first-quarter net
income to 33.8 million liras. Profit in the second quarter may
surge to 15.5 million liras from 3.8 million liras a year
earlier, according to the median estimate of four analysts on
Bloomberg.  Gubretas trades at 6.8 times estimated 12-month earnings,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a multiple
of 12.4 for Istanbul-based  Bagfas Bandirma Gubre Fabrikalari AS (BAGFS) ,
12.5 for Jubail-based  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)  and 9.8 for
Tel Aviv-based  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)   Eight analysts recommend buying shares of Gubretas, while
four say hold,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
