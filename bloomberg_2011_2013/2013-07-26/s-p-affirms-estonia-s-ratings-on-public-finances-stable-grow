Estonia ’s credit rating was affirmed
by  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings Services, which cited the Baltic
country’s strong public finances and resilient economic growth
helped by export demand outside the euro area.  Standard & Poor’s kept Estonia’s long-term government bond
rating at AA-, the fourth-highest investment grade, on par with
 Czech Republic  and  China . The ratings company left the outlook
at stable. Moody’s and Fitch Ratings both rate Estonia as the
fifth-highest investment grade.  Estonia’s economic growth has averaged about 5 percent
since 2010, with Swedish, Finnish and Russian demand for its
electronics, wood and machinery products helping the newest
euro-area member to weather Europe’s debt crisis. The $22
billion economy, which still remains below output levels before
the 20 percent slump in the wake of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.’s 2008 demise, expanded 3.2 percent last year, the European
Union’s third-fastest pace.  “We expect that lower investment rates will keep economic
growth at lower levels than before 2009, but that growth will
still average 3.4 percent between 2013 and 2016,” S&P said
today in an e-mailed statement from  London . “Strong public
finances and low government leverage remain key strengths,
offsetting relatively low per-capita GDP for the rating
category.”  Estonia had a preliminary budget deficit of 0.3 percent of
gross domestic product last year after becoming the only euro-area member to run surpluses in 2010-2011. It had the lowest
public debt among the region’s 17 members at the end of 2012 at
10.1 percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
