Demand for  Ghana ’s bid to raise $1
billion on international capital markets amounted to more than
twice that of the debt offered, according to Citigroup Inc.,
which helped arrange issuance.  The order book amounted to about $2.2 billion, Nicholas Samara, the London-based vice president of Central and Eastern
Europe, Middle East and Africa, at Citigroup, said by phone
today. The government issued $750 million of 10-year notes at
7.875 percent and will next Friday exchange an additional $250
million of the bonds for existing debt maturing October 2017,
Sam Mensah, a consultant for Ghana’s Finance Ministry, said by
phone from New York.  “This financing is strategically put in place to support
the country to continue its trajectory of economic growth,”
Citigroup’s Samara said. The coupon rate compares with 6.63
percent in Nigeria’s sale of 10-year bonds on July 2 and 6.875
percent  Rwanda  got in an April issue.  The bond sale in the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
took place as African nations tap appetite for assets from the
world’s fastest-growing region after developing Asia. Like
Rwanda, Ghana is rated five steps below investment grade at B by
Standard & Poor’s, compared with BB- for Nigeria, which is three
steps away. Ghana, which became the first sub-Saharan African
nation outside South Africa to sell Eurobonds in September 2007,
forecasts an expansion of 8 percent this year in the $41 billion
economy.  Budget Deficit  The 2023 bond will be listed on  Ghana Stock Exchange (GGSECI)  and
the Irish Stock Exchange, making it the first Eurobond to be
listed on a local market in sub-Saharan  Africa , outside of South
Africa, the ministry said in a statement on its website. The
funds will also be used for capital projects approved in the
2013 budget and refinancing the 2017 debt to lower its cost of
borrowing, it said.  Yields on the $750 million 2017 debt fell two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.95 percent as of 1:01 p.m. in
 London . The yields have jumped 108 basis points this year,
compared with a 122 basis-point increase in emerging-market
 bonds , JPMorgan Chase & Co. data show.  Ghana’s budget deficit jumped to 12.1 percent of gross
domestic product in 2012 from 4.3 percent the previous year as
the government boosted salaries for civil servants. The Finance
Ministry is forecasting the gap will narrow to 9 percent this
year. In the first four months of 2013, the shortfall was 3.8
percent of GDP, compared with a forecast of 3 percent, the
central bank said in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
