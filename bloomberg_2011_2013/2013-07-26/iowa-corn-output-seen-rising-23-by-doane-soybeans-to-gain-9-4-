Corn output in Iowa, the biggest
U.S. producer, will rise 23 percent this year from the drought-damaged crop of 2012, while the soybean harvest increases 9.4
percent, according to Doane Advisory Services Co.  Corn production in the state will rise to 2.301 billion
bushels from 1.877 billion last year, the St. Louis-based
researcher said today in an e-mail, citing data collected during
a survey of fields. Yields will jump 26 percent to a four-year
high of 173 bushels an acre from 137 bushels last year, in line
with the previous five-year average of 172.2.  “The high plant population tends to support average or
above-yield potential in some of the better areas,” Marty Foreman, a Doane senior economist, said in the e-mail.  Soybean output in the state, the largest U.S. grower, will
rise to 452.6 million bushels from 413.8 million, with yields of
48 bushels an acre, up from 44.5 a year earlier, Doane said.  “Yield prospects were found at about the five-year average
potential in portions of the central and western districts, as
well as areas of the southeast,” said Bill Nelson,  a Doane
senior economist. “Few outstanding fields were observed,
however, and there was a majority of acreage in the north
central, northeast, and east central that rated, at best,
average, and at worst, much-below average.”  About 63 percent of the fields were abnormally dry on July
23, up from 20 percent a week earlier,  U.S. Drought Monitor  data
show. A year earlier, 100 percent of the state was in moderate
to extreme drought.  Average  rainfall  in the week ended July 21 was 0.06 inch
(0.15 centinmeter), below the averge of 1 inch, Harry Hillaker,
the Iowa state climatologist, said in a July 21 report. About 54
percent of top soil moisture was rated short or very short.  Doane economists will survey fields in the eastern Midwest
beginning July 29, before compiling national crop forecasts next
week. The U.S. Department of Agriculture will release its first
field-based estimates Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
