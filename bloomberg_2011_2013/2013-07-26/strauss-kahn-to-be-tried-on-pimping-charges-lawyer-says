Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the former
head of the International Monetary Fund, will be tried by a
French court on pimping charges, his lawyer Frederique Baulieu
said in an interview.  Strauss-Kahn was charged earlier this year with acting as a
procurer in a prostitution ring in the northern French city of
Lille. DSK, as Strauss-Kahn is known in France, has denied the
charges.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
