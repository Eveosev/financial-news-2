Cotton futures fell the most in two
weeks on speculation that  China , the world’s largest user, will
produce more of the fiber than forecast.  China probably will harvest 7.22 million metric tons in the
12 months that start Aug. 1, more than the 7.05 million forecast
in June, researcher Cotlook Ltd. said yesterday in a report.
Global production will exceed demand by 2.14 million tons, or 5
percent more than forecast last month, Cotlook said.  “People weren’t expecting those numbers,” Michael Smith,
the president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie,
 Florida , said in a telephone interview. “We’re going to
continue see increased supply and decreased demand.”  Cotton for December delivery slumped 1.4 percent to 84.82
cents a pound at 12:50 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
heading for the biggest loss since July 11.  Prices through yesterday were up 14 percent this year on
signs of reduced output in the U.S., the world’s largest
exporter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
