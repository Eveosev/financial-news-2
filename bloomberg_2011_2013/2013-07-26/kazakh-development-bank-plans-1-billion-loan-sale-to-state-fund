Development Bank  of  Kazakhstan  JSC,
a state-owned lender that promotes industry, plans to sell 151
billion tenge ($1 billion) of bad loans to government-controlled
Investment Fund of Kazakhstan.  Development Bank wants to sell the loans at a discount
equal to the amount of provisions set aside to cover potential
losses, Deputy CEO Mirzhan Karakulov said by phone today from
the Kazakh capital, Astana. The assets will be transferred by
year-end so the bank will be eligible for tax breaks, he said,
without naming the discount.  Kazakh lenders are still weighed down by souring assets
four years after central  Asia ’s biggest energy producer used $10
billion from its oil fund to support banks and companies
following a credit squeeze and collapse in property prices. The
country’s financial industry is “handcuffed” by non-performing
assets and needs to repair its balance sheets faster to free up
resources, the  International Monetary Fund  said in November.  Development Bank’s loan-loss reserves amounted to 130
billion tenge last year, or 27 percent of total lending,
compared with 31 percent in 2011, according to its  website . Its
loan holdings rose to 474 billion tenge last year, an increase
of 73 billion tenge from 2011, the bank said.  Investment Fund is expected to pay cash for the loans in
about five years, according to Karakulov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
