Principal Financial Group Inc. (PFG) , the
seller of life insurance and retirement products, rallied the
most in 19 months after reporting  profit  that beat analysts’
estimates and raising its dividend.  Principal  advanced  5.7 percent to $42.75 at 10:19 a.m. in
New York, the third-best performer in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and the most since December 2011. Shares of the Des
Moines, Iowa-based insurer have gained 49 percent this year.  Net income rose 33 percent to $222.3 million in the three
months ended June 30 on better results from retirement products
and money management, Principal said yesterday in a statement.
Operating profit of 91 cents a share exceeded by nine cents the
average  estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The headline earnings beat was broad-based, as every
operating segment was stronger than expected,” Ed Shields, an
analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, wrote in a research
note.  Principal boosted the quarterly  dividend  on its common
stock 13 percent to 26 cents a share.  “We continue to grow net income and the percentage of
earnings from fee-based businesses, providing financial
flexibility to deploy capital in the best interest of our
shareholders,” Chief Financial Officer Terry Lillis said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
