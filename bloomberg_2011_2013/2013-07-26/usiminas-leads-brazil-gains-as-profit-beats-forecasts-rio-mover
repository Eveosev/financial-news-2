Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker by output, led gains
among Brazilian stocks after reporting earnings that exceeded
estimates.  Preferred shares of Usiminas, as the Belo Horizonte,
Brazil-based company is known,  rose  8.5 percent to 8.47 reais at
11:10 a.m. in Sao Paulo, heading toward its highest close since
June 6. The stock, which traded at 77 percent of the 3-month
average volume, had the biggest  advance  in Brazil’s benchmark
Ibovespa index.  Usiminas reported second-quarter adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, rose
to 441.3 million reais ($196.7 million) in a statement today.
That exceeded the 388.8 million-real average of six  analysts’
estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The net loss narrowed to 59.5
million reais from 101.7 million reais a year earlier, also
beating estimates.  “The second-quarter results signal a turnaround,”
Fernando Pertini, chief executive officer of Millenia Asset
Management International SA, said in e-mailed comments from
Panama City. “Ebitda margins will continue to improve, as
international flat steel prices are showing signs of inventory
rebuilding. The company is very cheap related to peers now.”  Gerdau SA is  Brazil ’s largest steelmaker by output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
