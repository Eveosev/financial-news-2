Daimler AG (DAI) , the world’s third-biggest maker of luxury vehicles, is barred from registering its
Mercedes-Benz compact models in France because regulators have
stopped accepting a coolant fluid used in the vehicles.  The Mercedes A- and B-Class as well as the CLA coupe can’t
be registered in the country as they use a refrigerant that no
longer meets to European Union environmental regulations, the
Ministry of Ecology, Development and Energy said in a statement
today. Daimler said today that it plans legal action against the
move, which it called a misreading of EU law.  Daimler has been in talks for about a year with European
authorities over a newer refrigerant, R1234yf, that regulators
say meets stricter standards on greenhouse gas emissions. The
Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer has held off from
switching to R1234yf, saying the new fluid is susceptible to
catching fire in car crashes.  Daimler sold 15,745 compact vehicles in  France  in the first
six months of 2013, accounting for about 2 percent of its global
car deliveries in the period, Ulrike Bless, a spokeswoman, said
by phone.  The carmaker was in “discussions with all the relevant
institutions in order to reach rapid clarification of the
situation,” Daimler said in its second-quarter report published
July 24.  French regulators are incorrectly basing their decision on
a provision of EU regulations that allows vehicles to be banned
in the event of a “major” immediate risk to people’s health or
the environment, “which is absolutely invalid in this current
case,” Daimler said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
