Gold headed for the longest weekly
rally since March as U.S. economic data backed the case for
sustained monetary stimulus. Russia and Kazakhstan added bullion
to reserves for a ninth month in June.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.3 percent to $1,338.50 an
ounce, and traded at $1,334.55 at 8:30 a.m. in Singapore. Prices
are 3 percent higher this week after advancing to a one-month
high of $1,348.65 on July 24. Volumes for Shanghai’s benchmark
spot bullion contract climbed to a one-week high of 14,618
kilograms yesterday.  Gold is up 8.1 percent in July, heading for the best month
since January 2012, as the Bloomberg  Dollar Index  retreated 1.5
percent after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s
too early to decide whether to begin scaling back  bond purchases 
in September. Data this week showed sales of new U.S. homes rose
in June to a five-year high while claims for jobless benefits
increased. Central banks including Russia and Kazakhstan
increased  gold reserves  in June, International Monetary Fund
data showed.  “Gold advanced on expectations that the Fed will maintain
stimulus measures after U.S. jobless claims rose more than
expected,”  Lachlan Shaw , an analyst at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , wrote in an e-mail today.  Gold for December delivery increased as much as 0.5 percent
to $1,336.10 an ounce on the Comex in  New York , before trading
at $1,334.80, also set for a third week of gains.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed as much as 0.5
percent to $20.3595 an ounce before trading at $20.2877, heading
for a weekly gain. The metal has risen 3.2 percent in July, set
for the first monthly increase since January.  Spot platinum was little changed at $1,449.70 an ounce,
poised to advance for a third week and also heading for the
first monthly gain since January. Palladium added 0.1 percent to
$739.80 an ounce to trim the first weekly loss in a month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
