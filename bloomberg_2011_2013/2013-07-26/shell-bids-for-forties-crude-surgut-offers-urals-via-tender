Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  wasn’t able to
buy  North Sea  Forties crude even after raising its bid to a
higher level than the previous day. There were no bids or offers
for Russian Urals blend in the Platts window.  OAO Surgutneftegas is said to be offering three 100,000
metric-ton cargoes of Urals for loading from northwest Europe in
August via a tender, according to two people with knowledge of
the matter, asking no to be identified because the information
is confidential.  North Sea  Shell failed to buy Forties for loading from Aug. 17 to
Aug. 23 at a premium of 70 cents a barrel to Dated Brent,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. The company sought to buy
a cargo for earlier shipment yesterday at plus 65 cents.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $106.95 cents
barrel on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, compared with $107.32 in the previous session. The
October contract was at $106.09, a discount of 86 cents to
September.  Mediterranean/Urals  Surgut is said to be offering Urals for loading Aug.14 to
Aug. 15 and  Aug. 19 to Aug. 20 from Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea.
The company is offering a third shipment loading on Aug. 20 to
Aug.21, from Primorsk, also on the Baltic Sea. The tender closes
July 29.  Urals last sold in the Platts window on July 24 at a
premium of 65 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, according to the
survey. No offers were made in the window for a second day.  Russia will export 3.8 million tons of Urals from Primorsk
in August, or 898,516 barrels a day, the lowest level in at
least five years, a final loading program seen by  Bloomberg News 
shows.  Loadings from Ust-Luga are scheduled at 1.8 million metric
tons, unchanged from a preliminary plan obtained by Bloomberg on
July 26.  Exports from Novorossiysk in the  Baltic Sea  are scheduled
at 2.789 million tons of Urals and 240,000 tons of Siberian
Light crude.  Iraq halted crude flows through the Turkish port of Ceyhan
today at 7 a.m. local time, according to port agent Boutros
Maritime & Transport SA. Crude flows were restored yesterday
around midday after leaks were fixed, North Oil Co. said in a
statement on Thursday.  West Africa  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will export
52 crude cargoes in September, three less than August, a final
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Exports will total 49.955 million barrels, or 1.67 million
barrels a day, in September, the plan showed. That compares with
a revised schedule of 52.74 million barrels, or 1.7 million
barrels a day next month. Most shipments are of 950,000 to 1
million barrels. The final program is in line with the
preliminary schedule that was released on July 16.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, may
invite offers next week for crude cargoes for October to
December delivery, said a company official.  The company plans to issue a tender on July 30, with offers
due the next day, according to the official who asked not to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media.  To contact the reporters on this story:
