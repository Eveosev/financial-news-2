Owners of the Navajo Generating
Station, a coal-fired power plant near the Grand Canyon, have
proposed shuttering a unit by 2020 to avoid an Environmental
Protection Agency mandate to install pollution-control devices.  The proposal was submitted to the EPA today in response to
the agency’s plan set out earlier this year that would force the
plant to install equipment on smokestacks to eliminate nitrogen
oxide emissions. The EPA must still approve the plan and a
decision will probably be made after comments are due in
October.  The Navajo Generating Station, the largest coal plant in
the U.S. West, began operating in the mid-1970s in Page,
 Arizona , less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon. Pollution
from the 2,250 megawatt plant is blamed for poor visibility in
eight national parks.  The plant is owned by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and
five utilities: Salt River Project, Los Angeles Department of
Water & Power, Arizona Public Service Co., Nevada Power Co. and
Tucson Electric Power Co.  The proposal submitted by those entities today would lead
to greater reductions in nitrogen oxide than that forecast under
EPA’s plan, according to a fact sheet from Salt River Project.
Under the plan, the owners would either shutter one generating
unit by 2020 or achieve reductions in pollutants equivalent to
that action. In addition, the Interior Department said it would
agree to renewable energy projects on Indian land as part of
this effort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
