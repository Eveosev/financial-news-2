German bonds had their first weekly
drop this month as euro-area economic reports that beat analyst
estimates reduced demand for the region’s safest assets.  The benchmark 10-year yield was two basis points from the
highest level in two weeks before the  European Central Bank 
meets next week to review monetary policy. Italy’s 10-year bonds
fell for a fourth day as the nation prepared to sell a combined
6.75 billion euros ($8.96 billion) of bonds.  Greece ’s bonds
advanced for a second day as euro-area governments approved the
release of a 2.5 billion-euro loan instalment to tide the nation
through the coming weeks.  “The upbeat economic data from the  euro zone  pushed yields
back up,” Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at
 Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich said, referring to purchasing
managers’ indexes. “We should be trading roughly between 1.50
to 1.70 percent. Everybody is holding back today to see what the
next week will bring.”  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  was little changed at 1.67 percent
as of 5 p.m.  London  time yesterday having increased 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, this week. It reached 1.69
percent yesterday, the highest since July 9. The price of the
1.5 percent bond due in May 2023 was at 98.51.  A  purchasing managers index  showed euro-area factory output
unexpectedly expanded in July for the first time in two years.
The gauge rose to 50.1 this month from 48.8 in June, Markit
Economics said on July 24. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
The Ifo Institute’s German business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives and published yesterday, increased to
106.2 from 105.9 in June.  Italy Sales  Italy’s benchmark 10-year yield rose less than one basis
point after climbing to the highest level in a week even as it
sold 3 billion euros of zero-coupon bonds today. The  yield  was
at 4.40 percent after climbing to 4.44 percent, the highest
level since July 18.  The Treasury in  Rome  today sold the zero-coupon securities
due in June 2015 at 1.857 percent, down from 2.403 percent at
the previous auction of similar-maturity debt on June 25.
Investors bid for 1.56 times the amount offered, versus 1.48
times last month.  Italy will sell 3 billion euros of five-year notes and 3.75
billion euros of bonds due in March 2024 on July 30.  Italy, the euro area’s biggest bond market, is set to repay
about 34 billion euros of coupons and redemptions to investors
next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash Offset  “In cash terms the auction is more than offset by the cash
that the market’s going to receive so I’m fairly confident the
auction is ultimately going to go well and pressure on the
market is ultimately going to prove transitory,” said  Peter
Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank in London.  Greece’s bonds gained after European Commission spokesman
Simon O’Connor told reporters the country would get 2.5 billion
euros of aid from the European Financial Stability Facility and
1.5 billion euros of income generated to national central banks
from the securities markets program to tide it through the
coming weeks.  A German parliament committee votes on July 29 to give the
go-ahead for Germany’s contribution.  The  Greek 10-year yield  fell 15 basis points to 10.07
percent after dropping to 10.03 percent on July 23, the lowest
level since June 19.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Greece and  Belgium , according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian securities returned 3.1 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Greek debt
rose 19.4 percent and German bonds handed investors a loss of
1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
