Gold extended declines in London on
speculation higher prices will curb demand from jewelers.  Prices have climbed for three weeks as U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s too early to decide whether
to scale back on stimulus to boost the economy. Physical
purchases of gold have slowed in the past two weeks as higher
prices deterred demand, Standard Bank Group Ltd. said.  “If the $1,300 level can’t hold, look for a quick collapse
back to the $1,265-70 support area,” said Jim Pogoda, a trading
consultant at Gold Bullion International in  New York , in an e-mail yesterday. “This will continue to be a market driven by
the latest hints of what the Fed might do, and of course when.”  Gold for immediate delivery dropped 0.4 percent to
$1,329.31 an ounce by 10:33 a.m. in  London . Gold futures traded
in New York were 0.1 percent lower at $1,328.40 an ounce.  Platinum fell 1.1 percent to $1,433.61 an ounce, palladium
was down 25 cents at $738.75 an ounce and silver retreated 0.8
percent to $20.0984 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
