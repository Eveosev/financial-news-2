Genting Malaysia Bhd. (GENM)  expects to
spend at least 3 billion ringgit ($937 million) over five years
to revamp the country’s sole casino resort and will tie up with
21st Century Fox Inc. on a theme park to attract more visitors.  Genting will add 1,300 rooms at the  Malaysia  resort,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lim Kok Thay told reporters
in Kuala Lumpur today. It will spend 400 million ringgit to open
the refurbished theme park with Fox.  Genting Malaysia , based in Kuala Lumpur, is revamping the
theme park while pushing to diversify earnings outside its home
market, where  60 percent  of the population is Muslim. Gambling
is forbidden for Muslims in Malaysia as it is considered
unethical under Islam.  The revamped park will feature some of the brands from Fox
films including the Ice Age, Rio, Alien and Night at the Museum.
It will cover 25 acres and feature more than 25 rides and
attractions, the company said. The redeveloped project will open
in 2016, the company said.  “This landmark development is our first response to the
growing demand for theme parks with a cinematic nature,” Lim
said today.  The theme park was opened 35 years ago within the hill-top
resort located about an hour’s drive from capital  Kuala Lumpur .  Genting will use internal funds for initial investment of
the park and may tap the market for cheaper financing later, Lim
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
