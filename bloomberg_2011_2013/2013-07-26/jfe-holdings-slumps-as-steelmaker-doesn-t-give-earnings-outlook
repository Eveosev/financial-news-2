JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) ,  Japan ’s second-biggest steelmaker, tumbled in  Tokyo  trading after declining to
provide a full-year profit forecast, citing difficulty in
reaching a rational estimate.  The shares fell as much as 232 yen, or 9.2 percent, to
2,340 yen as of 2:23 p.m. in Tokyo after JFE said it couldn’t
provide forecasts for fiscal year sales, net income or operating
profit. Current profit will total 170 billion yen this fiscal
year, the company said.  The statement on the outlook came as JFE reported a 27
percent gain in net income to 23 billion yen ($233 million) in
the three months ended June 30.  First-quarter sales at JFE increased 15 percent to 840
billion yen, while operating profit more than doubled to 25
billion yen, the company said in the statement.  JFE plans to save 100 billion yen in the 12 months to March
2014 after 120 billion yen of cost reductions in the previous
year, the company said April 23.　  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) , the world’s second-biggest steelmaker created by the merger of Nippon Steel Corp.
and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. in October, is scheduled to
report quarterly results on July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
