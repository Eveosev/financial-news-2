Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s anti-fungal
Nizoral tablets raise the risk of deadly liver injuries and
harmful drug interactions and their use should be limited,
regulators in the U.S. and European Union said.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement
today that it changed the drug’s label to warn that Nizoral
tablets shouldn’t be the first line of treatment for a fungal
infection. The European Medicines Agency, meanwhile, said it was
recommending a suspension of marketing for oral treatments
containing ketoconazole, Nizoral’s main ingredient.  The risk of liver damage, including hepatitis, outweighs
the drug’s benefits, the EU agency said, while the FDA said the
medication can cause adrenal-gland problems as well as liver
injuries that may be fatal or require a transplant. New
Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J, the world’s  biggest maker  of
health-care products, hasn’t released sales figures for the
tablet in recent financial statements.  Nizoral also comes in topical formulations, including
creams, shampoos, foams, and gels applied to the skin, the FDA
said. None of those have been associated with liver damage,
adrenal problems, or drug interactions, the FDA said.  J&J rose less than 1 percent to $92.83 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained  32 percent  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
