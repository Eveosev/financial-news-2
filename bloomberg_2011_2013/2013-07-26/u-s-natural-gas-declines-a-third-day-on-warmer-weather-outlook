Natural gas futures tumbled to the
lowest level since March in  New York  on milder weather that will
cut demand from  power plants .  Gas dropped 6.2 percent this week, capping the biggest
decline since the seven days ended Dec. 14, after predictions
that most of the eastern U.S. will see seasonal temperatures,
with lower readings in the Midwest, from July 31 through Aug. 9,
said MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . The
government reported below-average  supply gains  the previous two
weeks as unusually hot weather spurred electricity use.  “The weather forecast showed a persistence of cooler
temperatures for the eastern half of the U.S.,” said Teri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in
New York. “The weather pattern should lead to an accelerated
rate of inventory restocking.”  Natural gas for August delivery fell 8.9 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $3.555 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since March 6.
Volume was 20 percent below the 100-day average at 3:03 p.m. The
futures are up 6.1 percent this year.  The discount for August futures versus October, a proxy for
gauging supply levels before the peak heating-demand season,
widened 0.7 cent to 2.7 cents.  August $3.60 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were down 5.6 cents to 0.1 cent per
million Btu on volume of 1,108 at 3:06 p.m. Calls accounted for
49 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in September was 30.54 percent at 3 p.m.,
compared with 29.68 percent yesterday.  Below Normal  The high temperature in  New York City  on Aug. 9 may be 76
degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 8 below normal, and Atlanta’s
reading may be 7 lower than the average at 81 degrees, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Tropical Storm Dorian, 1,295 miles (2,085 kilometers) east
of the northern Leeward Islands, is moving west-northwest and
may be over the southern Bahamas early July 31, the National
Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
The storm has maximum winds of 50 miles per hour and is expected
to weaken a bit in the next day or so, the center said.  “Although it is too early to tell where it will land
eventually, the storm would push prices higher only if it causes
significant disruptions to gas production in the  Gulf of
Mexico ,” Shiyang Wang, an analyst with Barclays Plc in New
York, said in a note to clients today. “If it heads toward
 Florida , potential power outages and cooler weather due to heavy
rainfall could dampen demand.”  Gulf Production  The Gulf will account for 5.8 percent of U.S. gas
production in 2013, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Electricity generators are the largest consumers of gas in the
nation, accounting for 32 percent of demand, EIA data show.  Gas stockpiles  rose by 41 billion cubic feet last week to
2.786 trillion, below the five-year average gain of 53 billion
for the period, an EIA report yesterday showed.  A  deficit  to the historic average widened to 1.6 percent
from 1.2 percent the previous week. Inventories were 12.5
percent below  year-earlier levels , compared with 13.1 percent in
last week’s report.  The number of  rigs drilling  for gas held steady this week
at 369 after climbing the four previous weeks,  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) 
data today showed. The rig count is down 14 percent this year.  U.S. gas production will increase to a record this year as
new wells come online at shale deposits such as the Marcellus in
the Northeast, according to the EIA. Marketed gas output will
increase 1.1 percent from 2012 to 69.96 billion cubic feet a
day, the agency said in its July 9 Short-Term Energy Outlook.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
