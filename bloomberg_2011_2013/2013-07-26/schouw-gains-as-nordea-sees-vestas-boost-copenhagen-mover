A/S  Schouw & Co (SCHO) , which owns 4
million shares in  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , rose in Copenhagen
trading after Nordea Equity Research raised its price estimate
for the company, citing higher value of its investments.  Schouw rose as much as 2.1 percent to 199 kroner and also
traded at that price at 9:15 a.m. in the Danish capital. Volume
was 21 percent of the three-month daily average.  Schouw’s stake in Vestas, which equals 1.96 percent of the
wind turbine-maker’s market capital, has tripled in value since
the start of February as equity investors bet Vestas is
succeeding with its restructuring plans. Schouw’s fully-owned
fish feed unit BioMar A/S has also gained in value as higher
profitability offsets lower sales volumes, according to a note
published by Nordea today.  “We lift our target price to 240 kroner per share from 205
kroner, driven by BioMar and Vestas,” Dan Kirk Wejse, an
analyst with Nordea in Copenhagen, said in the note. Wejse
repeated a buy  recommendation  on Schouw shares.  Nordea also said that the Aarhus, Denmark-based company may
use proceeds from last year’s 110 million-euro ($145 million)
sale of smoke machine maker unit Martin Professional to buy back
own stock,  “We believe the main focus is on acquisitions related to
the existing businesses,” Nordea’s Wejse said. “However, if no
large acquisitions are made soon, we could see Schouw initiating
a share buyback program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
