Paul Tucker , who is stepping down as
a Deputy Governor at the Bank of England, will become a senior
fellow at Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of

chief of the central bank, said last month he would step down
after Mark Carney was named its governor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
