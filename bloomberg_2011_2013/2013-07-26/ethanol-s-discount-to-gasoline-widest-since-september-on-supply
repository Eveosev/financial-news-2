Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
expanded to the widest in 10 months after stockpiles climbed for
three consecutive weeks.  The spread expanded by 2.44 cents to 81.64 cents a gallon,
the steepest since Sept. 28. A July 24 Energy Information
Administration report showed that  inventories  reached the
highest level since April 19 in the longest streak of gains
since December.  “There seems to be a little more stuff out there than
thought,” said Mark Ruyack, a manager at StarFuels Inc. in
Jupiter,  Florida .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery added 0.3 cent to
$2.228 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. Prices have
climbed 1.7 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 2.74 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.0444 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for September delivery decreased 4 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $4.92 a bushel in Chicago. The more actively traded
December contract slipped 2.75 cents to $4.76.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 34 cents, up from 33 cents yesterday.  Ethanol Certificates  A law known as the Renewable Fuels Standard requires
refiners to use escalating amounts of ethanol in gasoline.
Compliance is tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers, or
RINS, that are attached to each gallon of biofuel and that can
be traded among companies.  Corn-based-ethanol RINs were unchanged at 99 cents, while
 advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol and
biodiesel, held at $1, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  stockpiles  climbed 4.1 percent last week to 17.3
million barrels, the Energy Department’s research arm said in
the July 24 report. Production declined 2.6 percent to 853,000
barrels a day, the least since May 3.  Imports have averaged 21,000 barrels a day this year,
double the rate a year earlier, according to EIA.  In cash market trading, ethanol slid 9.5 cents to $2.29 a
gallon in New York, 6 cents to $2.285 in the Gulf, 5.5 cents to
$2.205 in Chicago, and 4 cents to $2.535 a gallon on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf expanded 2 cents
to 25 cents, while Chicago’s discount to  New York  Harbor
contracted 4 cents to 8.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
