Synovus Financial Corp. (SNV)  repaid $968
million in bailout funds to the U.S. Treasury Department,
extinguishing one of the biggest debts still owed by a
commercial bank to the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  More than two-thirds of the sum was generated internally,
with the balance from common and preferred stock offerings
totaling $315 million, the Columbus, Georgia-based company said
today in a statement.  Synovus is one of hundreds of U.S. banks that took money
from the $700 billion TARP fund as the financial system teetered
near collapse in 2008. Chief Executive Officer Kessel Stelling
led the lender to its first annual profit since 2007 last year
as Synovus got rid of distressed assets and cut expenses.  “The events of the past week are huge for our company,
including three ratings agency upgrades, two successful  capital
offerings , and now the exit from TARP,” Stelling said in the
statement.  Synovus was little changed at $3.34 as of 1:07 p.m. in New
York trading.  The stock  has gained 36 percent this year, beating
the 30 percent return of the KBW Regional Bank Index. The bank
has about $27 billion in assets and 280 offices in Georgia,
Alabama,  South Carolina , Florida, and Tennessee.  The biggest bailouts still owed to taxpayers include  Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the Detroit-based car lender that accepted
packages of aid valued at $17.2 billion. Ally is in a different
program designed to support the automotive industry, said Adam
Hodge, a Treasury spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
