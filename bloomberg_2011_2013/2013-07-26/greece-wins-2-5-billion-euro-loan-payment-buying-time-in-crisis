Greece  won the release of a 2.5
billion-euro ($3.3 billion) loan installment to tide it through
the coming weeks, as European governments put off debate over
Greek debt relief until after  Germany ’s election in September.  Euro-area governments approved the payment today on a
conference call of senior finance officials, European Commission
spokesman Simon O’Connor said, after Greece yesterday took steps
to pare public-sector payrolls, meeting the last of 22
conditions set by creditors.  “As a result, with the proviso that the national approval
procedures are completed, which we expect to happen on Monday,
the disbursement can take place of 2.5 billion euros from the
EFSF and 1.5 billion euros of income generated to national
central banks from the securities markets program,” O’Connor
told reporters in Brussels today.  A German parliament committee votes on July 29 to give the
go-ahead for Germany’s contribution.  After the July payments, Greece is  scheduled  to receive an
additional 500 million euros from the European Financial
Stability Facility and to recoup the same amount from profits
made by euro-area central banks on Greek bonds in their
portfolios. These payments, set for October, are contingent upon
Greece’s fulfillment of additional requirements.  Greece is also scheduled to receive 1.8 billion euros from
the  International Monetary Fund . The IMF meets July 29 to
discuss its portion, German Deputy Finance Minister Steffen Kampeter said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
