Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , the
Spanish wind-turbine maker that’s tripled in value this year,
expects demand for its maintenance division to increase as
utilities lack the funds to build new projects.  Spain’s energy reform, a package of measures announced this
month that will cost power generators an estimated 2.7 billion
euros ($3.6 billion) this year, may benefit Gamesa, Chief
Executive Officer Ignacio Martin said today in an interview.  “This decree means new installations will come by
accident, if at all, and clients are going to need to maximize
revenues from the power production they have,” Martin said in
 Madrid . “Parks grow old, and if you don’t do anything to
maintain them their capacity becomes weaker.”  Gamesa, which supplies and maintains turbines for
developers including  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and FCC Energia SA, said this
week it returned to profit in the first half. The company hopes
to boost revenue in Spain from supplying maintenance services
and turbines that generate power at lower cost, Martin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
