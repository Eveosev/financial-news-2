A member of the Pink Panther gang of
jewel thieves escaped from a prison in the Swiss canton of Vaud
late yesterday, according to local police.  Milan Poparic, a 34-year-old Bosnian sentenced to six years
and eight months incarceration for robbing a jewelery store in
Neuchatel,  Switzerland , in 2009, escaped with another prisoner
and two accomplices while firing shots at guards, the Vaud
police said in a  statement  on the authorityâ€™s website today.  The Pink Panthers are named after the 1963 movie starring
Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau. The group targets expensive
jewelry stores in Europe, the  Middle East ,  Asia  and the U.S. and
may have carried out robberies of goods worth more than 300
million euros ($398 million) since 1999, according to  Interpol .  The other escapee, Adrian Albrecht, 52, was serving a
seven-year sentence in the prison near the French border and has
been convicted for kidnapping and abduction, robbery, money
laundering and theft, according to the statement.  The Swiss and French police are cooperating on a manhunt
after the four men fled in a gray vehicle.  Five inmates of a prison near Lausanne, Switzerland,
including two Pink Panther members, escaped in May and two were
caught, police  said  at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
