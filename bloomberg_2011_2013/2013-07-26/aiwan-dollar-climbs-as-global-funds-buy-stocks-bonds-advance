Taiwan’s dollar strengthened,
snapping a two-day decline, after overseas investors added to
their holdings of the island’s equities.  Government bonds  rose.  Global funds  bought  more shares than they sold this week,
with net purchases of $965 million, exchange data show.
President Ma Ying-Jeou has ruled out driving down the local
currency to boost exports and said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television yesterday the government still aims for
growth of at least 2 percent in 2013.  “The currency has been supported by the reversal of flows
into Taiwanese markets, especially in the equity space,” said
Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong
Kong . “Still, we look for a weakening of Taiwan’s dollar going
forward along with the rest of emerging Asia, given the weaker
yen and slowing China growth.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.1 percent today and this week to
NT$29.95 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei Forex prices show.
One-month non-deliverable forwards were up 0.1 percent during
the five-day period and advanced 0.3 percent today to NT$29.87,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 29 basis points from a week ago to 3.6 percent.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, today to 1.07 percent
in Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market. It rose one
basis point this week.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was at 0.388 percent,
little changed from 0.386 percent a week earlier, according to a
weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
