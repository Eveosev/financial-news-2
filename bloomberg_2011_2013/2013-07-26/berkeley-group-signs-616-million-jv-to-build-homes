Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K. homebuilder focused on London and southeast England, agreed
on a 400 million-pound ($616 million) joint venture with
charitable foundation Wellcome Trust Ltd. to invest in
residential regeneration projects.  The venture, named St. Katharine, will seek to buy long-term regeneration sites in London and the rest of southern
England, Berkeley said today in an e-mailed statement. Wellcome
Trust, a charitable foundation that invests in real estate to
raise money for medical research, will fund the venture,
according to the statement.  “We will be opportunity led, bidding at the right time for
sites that would not otherwise be viable and turning them into
fantastic places,” Pereira Gray, managing director of the
Wellcome Trust’s investment division, said in the statement.
“It is good news for the U.K. housing market.”  Berkeley, based in Cobham,  England , has profited from
acquiring land in the southeast of the country, where the
housing market escaped the worst effects of the global recession
and mortgage lending has been less constrained. U.K. home
sellers raised asking prices for a seventh month to a record in
July and values will increase twice as much as previously
forecast this year, property-website operator Rightmove Plc said
July 15.  The number of homes being built in Britain reached its
highest in five years, the National House Building Council said
in a statement on its website. A total of 67,422 new homes were
registered in the first half of this year, the most since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
