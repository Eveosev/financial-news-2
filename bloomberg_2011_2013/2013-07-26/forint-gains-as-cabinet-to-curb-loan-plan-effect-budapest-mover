The forint gained for the first time
in four days after a government official said plans to phase out
foreign-currency mortgages must not hurt  Hungary ’s currency.  The forint strengthened 0.2 percent to 296.30 per euro by
10:17 a.m. in Budapest, paring its weekly drop to 0.2 percent.
Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year forint bonds fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 6.06 percent.  Hungary will consult banks on plans to phase out foreign-currency mortgages, a process that will probably take years,
Gabor Orban, a state secretary at the  Economy Ministry , said in
an interview yesterday. Weakening the forint “isn’t part, or
wouldn’t be a welcome consequence” of the program, he said. The
forint and Hungarian banking stocks fell last week when the
government announced its intention to help borrowers.  “Based on the latest information, the banks may avoid the
worst-case scenario, which in addition would be a boon for the
forint,”  Akos Kuti , Budapest-based head of research at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., said in an e-mailed note dated today.  The forint weakened 12 percent in 2011 when the government
allowed the early repayment of foreign-currency mortgages at
below-market rates. Any comparison between the current plans and
the 2011 repayment would be “a big stretch,” the ministry
official said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
