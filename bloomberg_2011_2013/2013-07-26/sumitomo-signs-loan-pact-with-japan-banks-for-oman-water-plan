Japan’s  Sumitomo Corp. (8053)  and its
partners Malaysia’s Malakoff Bhd and Spain’s Cadagua SA signed a
loan agreement with three Japanese banks for a desalination
plant in Oman.  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., The Bank of Tokyo
Mitsubishi-UFJ, and  Japan Bank for International Cooperation 
will provide the funds, the Japanese trading company said in a
statement today, which didn’t specify an amount.  JBIC said in a separate statement today that it will lend
as much as $105 million for the project. The plant, to be
completed by October 2014, is expected to cost as much as 30
billion yen ($304 million), Sumitomo said in November when it
announced the project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
