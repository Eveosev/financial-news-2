Two bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1955 and a case of Chateau Latour 1966 are among
historic Bordeaux vintages on sale with wines from Burgundy and
 Italy  at a Bonhams San Francisco auction this weekend.  The two Lafite bottles are part of a mixed seven-bottle lot
from the estate, which carries a top estimate of $15,000 and
also includes four of its 1982 vintage and one from 1988. The
case of Latour is estimated to fetch as much as $7,000,
according to the online Bonhams catalog.  The auction comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top
Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this year, with declines
since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the first 10
weeks of the year. Demand at auctions has been driven by older
Burgundy vintages, including at a July 11 Bonhams London sale,
as appetite for Bordeaux has been less consistent.  “While Bordeaux struggles to inspire the market, other
regions are thriving,” Liv-ex wrote in a commentary posted on
its market blog. “Relative values look vastly different to the
market’s peak two years ago.”  At the Bonhams sale earlier this month, three bottles of
Romanee-Conti 1999 made up the top lot, selling for 23,000
pounds ($35,100), while another three-bottle lot of Romanee-Conti 1989 sold for 17,250 pounds. In an e-mailed statement
following the sale, Bonhams described the Burgundy estate as
“currently the most consistent performer for wine at auction.”  Among other wines for auction at the San Francisco sale
this weekend, a 12-bottle case of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild 1982
Bordeaux is estimated to fetch as much as $12,000 while rarer
Burgundies feature a 12-bottle mixed lot of Meursault from
producer Pierre Morey, including eight bottles of his Perrieres
1986, estimated at as much as $1,400.  Italian wines in the sale include six bottles of Barbaresco
Sori San Lorenzo Gaja spanning the years from 1993 to 2004,
priced to fetch as much as $1,300.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
