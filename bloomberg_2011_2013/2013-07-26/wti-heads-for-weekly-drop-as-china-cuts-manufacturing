West Texas Intermediate crude fell,
capping the first weekly drop in more than a month, on
speculation that  China ’s plans to cut excess manufacturing
capacity will reduce fuel consumption.  Futures slid 0.7 percent after China ordered more than
1,400 companies in 19 industries to cut excess production
capacity this year, part of efforts to shift toward slower,
more-sustainable economic growth. WTI reached $109.32 a barrel
on July 19, the highest level since March 2012, on signs the
 U.S. economy  is rebounding and on declining crude supplies.  “The news that China is ordering the reduction of excess
capacity has reignited concerns about slowing Chinese growth and
what that’s going to mean for energy demand,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We are still in the midst of a
correction after reaching a 16-month high last week.”  WTI crude for September delivery declined 79 cents to
$104.70 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
lowest settlement since July 9. Prices, which fell 3.1 percent
this week, have gained 14 percent this year. The volume traded
was 34 percent below the 100-day average at 3:56 p.m.  Brent for September settlement dropped 48 cents, or 0.4
percent, to end the session at $107.17 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the lowest closing
price since July 4. The volume of all futures traded was 48
percent below the 100-day average.  Various Grades  The European benchmark traded at a $2.47 premium to WTI,
compared with $2.16 yesterday. Brent fell below the U.S. grade
in intraday trading July 19 for the first time since August
2010. The bonus paid for Brent from the  North Sea  has shrunk
from as much as $23.44 a barrel on Feb. 8 because of the easing
of a supply bottleneck in the U.S.  “WTI has to trade at a discount to waterborne grades like
Brent or the economics don’t work,” said  Mike Wittner , head of
oil-market research for the Americas at  Societe Generale  in New
York. “We couldn’t sustain the move higher in WTI.”  Steel, ferroalloys, electrolytic aluminum, copper smelting,
cement and paper are among areas affected, China’s Ministry of
Industry and  Information Technology  said in a statement
yesterday, in which it announced the first-batch target of this
year to cut overcapacity. Excess capacity must be idled by
September and eliminated by the end of the year, the ministry
said, identifying the lines to be shut within factories.  U.S. equities also dropped after the Chinese announcement.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent and the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  retreated 0.3 percent at 2:46 p.m.  Fibonacci Retracement  WTI’s decline will quicken if the contract drops below
$102.96, a key Fibonacci level, said Bob Yawger, director of the
futures division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in  New York . The
figure is the 38.2 percent retracement level from a June 24 low
of $92.67 to the high on July 19.  After breaking through yesterday’s low of $104.08, “prices
will test $102.96, which is a big number on the Fibonacci
retracement,” Yawger said. “A violation of those numbers could
accelerate the move to the downside.”  WTI snapped the longest streak of weekly gains since March.
U.S.  crude production  climbed to 7.56 million barrels a day in
the seven days ended July 19, the most since December 1990, the
Energy Information Administration said July 24. Refiners reduced
processing by half a percentage point to 92.3 percent of
capacity after five weeks of increases, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department’s statistical unit.  Market Outlook  Futures may drop next week on concern that U.S. economic
growth will slow, curbing fuel demand, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Twenty-four of 38 analysts and traders, or 63 percent,
forecast WTI will decrease. Nine respondents, or 24 percent,
predicted a gain and five projected no change.  Tropical Storm Dorian became less organized and may weaken
as it moves across open waters of the Atlantic, according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center.  Dorian, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80
kilometers) per hour, was about 1,295 miles east of the northern
Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 21 mph, according
to a  center advisory  before 11 a.m. in New York.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 21 percent, down from 21.7 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 372,376
contracts as of 3:57 p.m. It totaled 589,799 contracts
yesterday, 11 percent below the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.85 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
