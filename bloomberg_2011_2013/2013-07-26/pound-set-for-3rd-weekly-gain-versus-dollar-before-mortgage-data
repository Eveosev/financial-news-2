U.K. government bonds rose for a
second day as the Treasury said Jon Cunliffe, a former adviser
to Prime Minister David Cameron, would become deputy governor
for financial stability at the Bank of England.  Two-year yields dropped toward the lowest in more than two
months as European stocks declined, boosting demand for safer
assets. The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee led by
new Governor Mark Carney meets on July 31 and Aug. 1. The pound
strengthened for a third week versus the dollar before reports
next week that economists said will show U.K. mortgage approvals
increased in June and manufacturing expanded in July.  “This appointment is basically trying to give Carney a
helping hand with regulation,” said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist
at Monument Securities Ltd. in London. “You’re gradually
looking at the scenario where the MPC becomes a bit more like
the Fed, with some members there to do a job that has less to do
with monetary policy. Gilts are in a range.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.33 percent at the 5 p.m. close in London
after dropping two basis points yesterday. The 1.75 percent gilt
due in September 2022 rose 0.355, or 3.55 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,538) face amount, to 95.24.  The two-year yield declined three basis points to 0.30
percent after falling to 0.27 percent on July 19, the lowest
level since May 9.  ‘Excellent’ Appointment  Cunliffe succeeds Paul Tucker, who is leaving for Harvard
University after losing out on the BOE governorship to Carney
last year. Currently the U.K.’s permanent representative to the
European Union, Cunliffe will start at the central bank on Nov.
1, the Treasury in  London  said.  The appointment of Cunliffe is “excellent,” according to
former central bank policy maker and Bloomberg Television
contributing editor David Blanchflower.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index of shares dropped 0.2 percent
and the FTSE 100 Index of U.K. equities fell 0.5 percent.  Gilts returned 1.2 percent in the past month through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bunds rose 0.8 percent and Treasuries gained 0.4 percent.  The pound was little changed today at $1.5373, having
strengthened 0.7 percent this week. It climbed to $1.5435
yesterday, the strongest since June 26. Sterling was also little
changed at 86.32 pence per euro.  Mortgage approvals rose to 59,700 last month from 58,242 in
May, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before the
Bank of England report on July 29. A  gauge  of manufacturing
climbed to 52.8 in July from 52.5 in June, a separate survey
showed before Markit Economics and the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply issue the figures on Aug. 1.  Growth Accelerates  The U.K. economy expanded 0.6 percent in the second quarter
after growing 0.3 percent in the previous three months, the
government said yesterday.  The BOE will keep its asset-purchase target at 375 billion
pounds and its benchmark interest rate at 0.5 percent when the
Monetary Policy Committee meets next week, according to
Bloomberg surveys. Carney is scheduled to explain his approach
to outlining the future path for interest rates in the central
bank’s Inflation Report to be released Aug. 7.  “We know the growth outlook has been improving and that
has been confirmed by the initial reading of the second-quarter
GDP print, accordingly that’s had a positive impact” on the
pound, said Chris Walker, a foreign-exchange strategist at
Barclays Plc in London. “I’d rather be short pound heading into
the Inflation Report,” he said, referring to a bet the currency
will weaken.  Sterling weakened 1.4 percent in the past month, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar declined 1.9 percent and
the euro strengthened 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
