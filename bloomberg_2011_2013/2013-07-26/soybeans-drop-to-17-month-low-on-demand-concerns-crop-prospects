Wheat futures rebounded from a 13-month low in  Chicago  on signs that cheaper grain is fueling
purchases by importers. Corn extended its slump after touching a
33-month low, while soybeans rose.  Export sales of U.S. wheat are up 45 percent since June 1,
compared with the same period a year earlier, reaching 12.31
million metric tons as of July 18, the government  reported 
yesterday. Purchases by China, the world’s largest consumer, are
up 10-fold during the period at 3.45 million tons, while  Brazil 
bought 1.2 million tons, up from 50,000 a year earlier. Futures
dropped 28 percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  “U.S. wheat is competitive on the world market,” Ken Smithmier, a grain analyst for the Hightower Report in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “Demand from  China  and Brazil is
improving.”  Wheat futures for delivery in September rose 0.2 percent to
close $6.5025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, after yesterday touching $6.48, the lowest for a most-active contract since June 19, 2012. The grain ended the week
down 2.1 percent, the second straight decline.  Corn futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$4.76 a bushel in Chicago, after touching $4.7475, the lowest
for a most-active contract since Oct. 4, 2010.  Prices are down 39 percent from a year ago, when the grain
was headed for a record high of $8.49 on Aug. 10 as a drought
cut production. This year, farmers will boost output by 29
percent to a record 13.95 million bushels, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said on July 11.  Midwest Crops  Forecasts of rain in the U.S. Midwest are improving
prospects for the nation’s corn crop. Production in  Iowa , the
biggest grower, will rise 23 percent this year from the drought-damaged crop of 2012, Doane Advisory Services Co. said today,
after touring four Midwest states this week.  “Recent rainfall and cool temperatures have gone a long
way in assuring good yields,”  Bill Gary , the president of
Commodity Information Services in  Oklahoma City , Oklahoma, said
today in a note to clients. “With the current forecast
indicating cool weather into mid-August, the only major hazard
to bumper crops of corn and soybeans will be an early frost.”  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.4 percent to
$12.285 a bushel on the CBOT, after reaching a 17-month low of
$12.0725. Prices have dropped 22 percent in the past 12 months
after Brazil and  Argentina  combined to harvest 24 percent more
than a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
