India’s 10-year bonds rose for a
second day as the rupee strengthened and a top government
official said the tightening measures taken by the central bank
to stem the currency’s slide should be sufficient.  The  Reserve Bank  of India raised two  interest rates  and
drained liquidity in the past two weeks to steady the rupee, a
contrast to the lowering of the key  repurchase rate  three times
this year. The steps “should be seen not as a precursor to a
substantial change in monetary stance, which, thus far, has been
on the easing side,”  Raghuram Rajan , the  Finance Ministry ’s
chief economic adviser, told Bloomberg India TV yesterday. The
rupee rose 0.6 percent versus the dollar today.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 slid nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.11 percent at 10:01
a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from the central bank’s
trading system. The rate reached 8.42 percent on July 24, the
highest for a 10-year benchmark bond since May 2012.  “The currency’s stability has brought some respite to the
 bond market ,” K. Ramanathan, chief investment officer at ING
Investment Management Pvt. in Mumbai, said by phone. “The
central bank’s commentary at the July 30 policy meeting will be
keenly watched by the market.”  The rupee has jumped 4.2 percent since sinking to a record
low of 61.2125 a dollar on July 8. A weaker currency makes
imports costlier and threatens to spur gains in  consumer prices ,
which have been climbing at an annual rate of about 10 percent
for more than a year. Primary dealers underwrote 79 percent of
the 150 billion rupees ($2.6 billion) worth of  government bonds 
to be auctioned today.  Swap Falls  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell eight basis
points to 9.26 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate was at a five-year high of 9.50 percent on July 24.  The RBI last week capped the amount banks can borrow in
daily repurchase auctions at 0.5 percent of deposits, and raised
the daily balance requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratios
to 99 percent from 70 percent effective July 27. It increased
the marginal standing facility and the  bank rate  to 10.25
percent from 8.25 percent on July 15, while keeping the
 repurchase rate  unchanged at 7.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
