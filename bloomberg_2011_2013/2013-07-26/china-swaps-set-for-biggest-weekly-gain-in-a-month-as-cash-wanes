China’s one-year  interest-rate swaps 
headed for the biggest weekly gain in more than a month on
speculation cash supply will wane as banks meet month-end
capital requirements.  People’s Bank of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  wrote in the
People’s Daily today that the nation will continue with prudent
monetary policy and keep a “reasonable” amount of money supply
and credit. Money-market rates reached a record high last month
due to a cash squeeze. A total of 85 billion  yuan  ($13.9 billion)
of central bank bills will mature next week, compared with zero
this week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The month-end effect is bigger than before because market
sentiment is still weak after undergoing the shock in June,”
said Becky Liu, a senior rates strategist at Standard Chartered
Plc in Hong Kong.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, climbed 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, this week to 4.07 percent as
of 10:48 a.m. in Shanghai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate gained two basis points today.  The overnight  repo rate , which measures interbank funding
availability, rose 49 basis points during the five days to 3.54
percent, a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center shows. It advanced 13 basis points today.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
