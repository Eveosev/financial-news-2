Triumph Group Inc. (TGI) , a maker of
fuselage parts for  Boeing Co. (BA)  747s, declined the most in more
than 23 months after saying production rate cuts on the jumbo
jet will reduce full-year earnings.  Triumph  fell  8.3 percent at the close in New York after
executives on a conference call today said output reductions on
Boeing’s biggest and most expensive model will cut 2014 earnings
per share by 10 cents.  Boeing said in April that monthly output will drop to 1.75
aircraft from 2 in 2014 amid dwindling demand for the largest
passenger planes and freighters. Chicago-based Boeing  accounted 
for 45 percent of Triumph’s sales during its fiscal first
quarter, down from 48 percent a year earlier, executives said.  Triumph Chief Executive Officer Jeffry Frisby said the
Wayne, Pennsylvania-based company is also hunting for
acquisitions, and sees “no shortage” of possible targets.  The shares  closed  at $77.22. Triumph has added 1.6 percent
since April 19, when Boeing said it would cut production.
Boeing, which declined 1 percent to $105.60 today, has risen 20
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
