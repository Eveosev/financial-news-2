Kia Motors Corp. (000270) ’s second-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates after South Korea’s second-largest carmaker sold more vehicles in China.  Net income  excluding minority interests rose 7.7 percent to
1.18 trillion won ($1.06 billion), compared with 1.1 trillion
won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said in a statement
today. Profit exceeded the 1.05 trillion won average of 18
 analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg in the past 28 days.
Revenue increased 4.5 percent to 13.1 trillion won.  Kia’s sales in China have jumped 22 percent on higher
demand for its K3 sedan, while its Sportage sport-utility
vehicle lifted deliveries by 1.5 percent in Europe, helping the
automaker buck an industrywide slump in the region. The gains
countered falling demand for its vehicles in the U.S., Kia’s
biggest market, and in South Korea.  “Kia exceeded expectations today, thanks to increasing
sales in  China ,” said Lee Sang Hyun, an auto analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co. “Moving forward, things look good
for the company, especially with its new model the Soul wagon
scheduled to be unveiled in the second half.”  Operating profit , or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, fell 8.5 percent to 1.13 trillion won.
That compares with the 1.01 trillion won average of 18 analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Kia rose 0.7 percent to 61,200 won at the close in Seoul
trading. The benchmark Kospi index gained 0.1 percent.  China Sales  Kia’s deliveries in China increased, helped by its K3 small
sedan introduced in the country in October. Sales from its China
factory rose 24 percent, according to data on the automaker’s
 website .  The company revised its sales target in China for this year
to at least 520,000 units, up from 500,000 units, Chief
Financial Officer Park Han Woo said during a conference call in
Seoul today. Production will also increase next year when its
third plant in the country starts operations as early as March,
Park said.  Kia’s sales advanced 1.5 percent in Europe, led by sales of
Sportage sport-utility vehicle and the new Cee’d hatchback.
Industrywide deliveries in the region declined 4.1 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Incentives  Kia spent 19 percent more on incentive costs for passenger
cars in the U.S. last quarter, according to Autodata. Its sales
fell 0.2 percent last quarter, compared with the industrywide
growth of 8.5 percent, according to company data.  The won strengthened 2.4 percent against the yen last
quarter, curbing Kia and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s competitiveness
against Japanese automakers.  Sales at home fell 4 percent from a year earlier. The
automaker in June started the planned increase in production of
vehicles at its Gwangju factory. The output will be raised to
620,000 units from 500,000, enabling Kia to export more
vehicles.  Kia’s sales dropped 3.7 percent in Latin America, while
industrywide deliveries in the region increased 7.9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.1 percent
in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding South Korea and China,
according to  company data  on its website.  Hyundai Motor, which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday
 reported  second-quarter profit fell to 2.4 trillion won, beating
the 2.37 trillion won average of 15 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg for 28 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
