Gasoline advanced on speculation
that Tropical Storm Dorian will strengthen and eventually
threaten oil production, refining or distribution on the U.S.
Gulf and East coasts.  Dorian, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80
kilometers) per hour, was about 1,425 miles east of the northern
Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 20 mph as of 5 a.m.
 New York  time, according to the  National Hurricane Center . The
Gulf is home to 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity, while the
New York Harbor market is the delivery point for the New York
Mercantile Exchange contract.  “Right now, Dorian is headed toward  Florida ,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “It
could go into the Caribbean. It could go up the East Coast.
Traders, if they’re looking at the National Hurricane Center
map, their bias is to be long gasoline.”  August-delivery gasoline rose 2.6 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$3.043 a gallon on the Nymex as of 9:56 a.m. on volume that was
28 percent below the 100-day average. Gasoline has dropped 2.6
percent this week, headed for its first weekly loss in a month.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI rose $1.35 to $21.25 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent widened $1.29 to $19.03.  Pump Prices  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell a fourth consecutive
day, dropping 0.7 cent to $3.648 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the lowest level
since July 15. Prices are 15.8 cents higher than a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel headed for the first loss in five
weeks as crude oil retreated after  China  reduced excess factory
capacity, signaling slowing growth in the world’s second-biggest
energy consumer.  Futures fell as China ordered companies in 19 industries to
reduce unused production capacity. China’s manufacturing
weakened more than estimated in July, according to a preliminary
survey of  purchasing managers . The U.S.  exported  1.03 million
barrels a day of distillates last week, according to a
preliminary estimate from the Energy Information
Administration.’  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery fell 1.36
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.0214 a gallon at 10:01 a.m. on the
Nymex on trading volume that was 21 percent below the 100-day
average. ULSD has declined 2.2 percent this week.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
