TT Electronics Plc (TTG) , a British maker
of components for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler AG,
advanced for a second day after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
upgraded its recommendation to buy.  The stock climbed 3.3 percent, taking the two-day gain to
7.2 percent, the biggest such advance since May 1.  “We expect modest progression in autos volumes, supported
by encouraging recent data for Europe,” Will Wyman, an analyst
at Goldman Sachs, said in a note to investors today.
Restructuring programs “will support further margin
expansion.” Goldman Sachs added the stock to its conviction
list with a six-month price target increased to 240 pence from
190 pence.  Europe accounted for 66 percent of Weybridge, England-based
TT Electronics’ 476.9 million pounds ($734 million) of revenue
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The stock closed at 170.50 pence in  London , taking the
advance to 18 percent this year and giving the company a market
value of 269.7 million pounds ($415 million).  Among six analysts who review the company and share their
findings with Bloomberg, five recommend buying the stock and one
suggests holding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
