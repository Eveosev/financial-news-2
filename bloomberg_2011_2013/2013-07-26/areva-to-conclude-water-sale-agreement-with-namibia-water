Areva SA (AREVA) , the world’s largest
producer of nuclear reactors, expects to sign an offtake
agreement to supply Namibia Water corp. with as much as 10
million cubic meters (2.64 billion gallons) of treated water
annually from its desalination plant in the country.  The water from the plant in the Erongo region has become
available as the desalination plant is twinned with the planned
Trekkopje uranium mine, which Areva halted last year after
uranium prices slumped. The Paris-based company has spent $970
million on the mine and $250 million in investment is needed to
complete the project.  “We are currently in the final stages of our negotiations
with Namwater,” said Hilifa Mbako, the managing director of
Areva Resource  Namibia , said yesterday in a response to e-mailed
questions. “We expect a ramp up to 10 million cubic meters over
five years.”  The water will be used by Namwater in the coastal towns of
Swakopmund and Walvis Bay, both of which lie in the Namib
Desert, and to supply uranium mines in the region, Mbako said.
Prices have been agreed he said, declining to be more specific.  The desalination plant has a design capacity of 20 million
cubic meters a year. Erongo region has annual demand for 13
million cubic meters of water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
