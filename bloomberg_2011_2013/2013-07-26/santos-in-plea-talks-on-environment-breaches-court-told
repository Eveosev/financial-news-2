Santos Ltd. (STO) ,  Australia ’s third-biggest oil producer, is discussing a plea agreement with
prosecutors over environmental breaches, a court was told.  The prosecution anticipates that Santos will plead guilty
to some of the eight counts of violating the  Petroleum (Onshore)
Act  in exchange for some charges being dropped, prosecutor Ann
Bonnor said in the Land and Environment Court in Sydney today.  Santos voluntarily disclosed the breaches to the New South
Wales state government and has already completed a “very
substantial draft of agreed facts” with the other side, Dean
Jordan, Santos’s lawyer, told Justice Peter Biscoe. The document
will be completed by Sept. 20, Jordan said.  In June, the New South Wales  Trade & Investment  department
 filed charges  against Adelaide, South Australia-based Santos.
The company failed to provide accurate environmental management
reports between June 2010 and September 2011, and declare a
spill of untreated production water from the Bibblewindi water
treatment plant in June 2011, the department said.  Biscoe granted Bonnor’s request that the court case be put
on hold until Sept. 20. The prosecutors need time to gather
evidence to determine the proper penalties in the case,
including remediation, and discuss them with Santos, Bonnor said
to support her request.  The case is Connell v Santos NSW Pty. 13/50435. Land and
Environment Court of New South Wales. (Sydney).  To contact the reporter on this story:
