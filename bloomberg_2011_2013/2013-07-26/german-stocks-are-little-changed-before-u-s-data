German stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  heading for a weekly drop, as
investors awaited a report on U.S. consumer sentiment.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  fell 3.5 percent amid concern Germanyâ€™s
largest steelmaker has failed to make progress in talks to sell
its plants in the Americas.  The DAX Index added less than 0.1 percent to 8,299.8 at
9:50 a.m. in Frankfurt, after earlier rising as much as 0.8
percent. The gauge has retreated 0.4 percent this week as some
companies posted worse-than-estimated results. The broader HDAX
Index was also little changed today.  In the U.S., a report at 9:55 a.m. New York time may show
 consumer confidence  slipped this month. The Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
dropped to 84 from 84.1 in June, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The initial
reading was for 83.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
