Lear Corp. (LEA) , a maker of car seating
and electrical systems, climbed to a post-bankruptcy high after
the company raised its 2013 sales forecast and posted second-quarter earnings that exceeded estimates.  The shares rose 2.8 percent to $67.80 in  New York , the
highest closing price since Lear exited bankruptcy in November
2009. The stock has surged 45 percent this year, compared with a
19 percent increase in the Russell 1000 Index.  Lear, based in Southfield, Michigan, reported second-quarter net income of $137.3 million, down from $145.4 million a
year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the per-share profit was
$1.62, more than the $1.36 average of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company also raised its full-year sales forecast
to $15.8 billion, from as much as $15.5 billion.  The quarterly profit was “an all-around solid beat,”
 Brian Johnson , a Chicago-based analyst with Barclays Plc, wrote
in a report. Lear’s forecast “appears conservative,” he said.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)  this week posted
second-quarter results that surpassed estimates. Ford reported a
per-share profit, excluding one-time items, of 45 cents, ahead
of the 37-cent average of 17 estimates. GM said its adjusted
profit totaled 84 cents a share, compared with the 77-cent
average of 13 estimates.  “We’ve had a good year winning business,” Lear Chief
Executive Officer Matt Simoncini said on a conference call with
investors. “We expect that trend to continue.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
