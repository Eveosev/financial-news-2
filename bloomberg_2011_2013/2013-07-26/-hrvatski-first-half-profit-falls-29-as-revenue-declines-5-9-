T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d. , the
Croatian unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said profit fell 29.4
percent in the first half of 2013 as the crisis continues to
hurt the economy of the European Union’s newest member.  Net income fell to 570 million kuna ($101 million), the
Zagreb-based company said in a Regulatory News Service statement
today. Revenue fell 5.9 percent to 3.4 billion kuna, while
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
or Ebitda, declined 17.8 percent to 1.4 billion kuna.  “We have delivered a resilient set of results and
maintained our leading market position despite continued
pressure from the challenging operating environment in the
second quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Ivica Mudrinic said in
a statement.  The phone company, 51 percent owned by Deutsche Telekom AG,
is looking beyond its traditional business to the Internet,  pay
television , and mobile-phone services as  Croatia  struggles to
exit a four-year long recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
