The Swiss franc climbed to its
strongest in five weeks against the dollar, with a fall in Asian
equities spurring buying of some haven assets.  “Once again the Swiss franc is sought as a haven,” Martin Furrer at Luzerner Kantonalbank in Lucerne,  Switzerland , said in
a note to clients. “A weak Japanese equity market gave our
country’s currency an additional upward push this morning.”  The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a ceiling of 1.20 per euro
on the franc nearly two years ago to ward off deflation and a
recession. The franc had nearly touched parity with the euro in
August 2011, as investors anxious about  Greece ’s debts sold the
common currency in favor assets perceived as better stores of
value.  The franc stood at 92.82 centimes at 11:46 am in Zurich,
having risen as much as 0.3 percent to 92.70 centimes against
the dollar earlier in the session, its strongest since June 21.
Against the euro it was little changed at 1.2336.  Asian stocks fell, with Japanese shares declining the most
in six weeks. Swiss stocks also weakened, down to a three-week
low as investors awaited a U.S. report on consumer sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
