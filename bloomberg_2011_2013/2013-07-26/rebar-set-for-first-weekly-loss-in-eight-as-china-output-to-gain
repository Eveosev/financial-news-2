Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  were poised for the first weekly drop in eight on
concern that a rally this month may spur more output in  China .  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.5 percent to 3,665  yuan  ($598) a
metric ton and was at 3,674 yuan at 11:10 a.m. The contract lost
0.5 percent this week, the first such drop since May.  With rebar priced above 3,600 yuan a ton, more than 60
percent of steelmakers are making profits, so the incentive to
boost output will be strong, according to Lv Xiaohua, analyst at
Everbright Futures Co. Profit margins are between 5 percent and
11 percent, spurring high output from rebar producers, Shenhua
Futures Co. said in a research report today.  “Some investors believe futures at this level can’t be
maintained because producers are responding by ramping up
production,” Lv said by phone from Shanghai.  China’s manufacturing weakened by more than estimated in
July, according to a preliminary survey of  purchasing managers 
released July 24 by HSBC Holdings Plc and Market Economics. If
confirmed in the final report Aug. 1, would be the lowest in 11
months. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was
unchanged at $132.10 a ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd. The average  spot price  for rebar gained 0.2 percent
to 3,470 yuan yesterday, the highest since May, according to
data from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
