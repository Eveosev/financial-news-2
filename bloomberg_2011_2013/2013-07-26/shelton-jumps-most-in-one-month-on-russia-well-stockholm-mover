Shelton Petroleum AB (SHELB)  advanced the
most in a month in Stockholm trading after the Swedish oil-exploration company with assets in Russia and Ukraine started
drilling a fourth well at the Rustamovskoye field.  Shares of Shelton Petroleum  added as much  as 1.20 kronor,
or 6.3 percent, to 20.30 kronor, their steepest intraday advance
since June 25. The stock traded 3.1 percent higher at 19.70
kronor as of 1:27 p.m. in the Swedish capital, with trading
volume at 24 percent of the three-month daily average.  Shelton Petroleum said today that it spudded the fourth
well, which “shows good flows and is connected to the field’s
infrastructure.” The company also said it will start fracking
inside the well, a process whereby the rock is broken up to
allow oil to flow more freely in the reservoir by inserting
fluids with additives under pressure.  “We are now producing” from all three “wells drilled on
the Rustamovskoye field,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert
Karlsson  said in a statement. “It is therefore positive that we
are able to commence drilling of a fourth well within such a
short time span. Together with the planned fracking, this gives
us a good opportunity to increase the production further and
enhance  cash flow  from the already profitable field.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
