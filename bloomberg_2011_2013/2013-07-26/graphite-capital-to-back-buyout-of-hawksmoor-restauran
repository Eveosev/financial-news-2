Graphite Capital Management LLP, the
private-equity owner of  London ’s Groucho Club, agreed to buy the
Hawksmoor chain of steakhouses, a year after acquiring a stake
in the Wolseley and Delaunay restaurants.  Hawksmoor’s founders, Will Beckett and Huw Gott, will both
stay with the company, the London-based private-equity firm said
in a statement today. Graphite will purchase a majority stake in
a transaction valuing Hawksmoor at about 40 million pounds ($62
million), said a person with knowledge of the takeover who asked
not to be identified because the terms haven’t been made public.  “We were impressed by the young, highly motivated team
which has successfully created a popular premium restaurant
concept during very difficult economic times,” Markus Golser, a
senior partner at Graphite, said in the statement. “Their focus
on consistently delivering high quality food and drink to a
discerning customer base will underpin future growth.”  Private-equity firms typically pool money from pension
plans and endowments with a mandate to buy companies within five
to six years, then sell them and return the money and a profit
after 10 years. The firms usually charge a management fee of as
much as 2 percent and keep 20 percent of the profits from
investments.  Graphite oversees a 475 million-pound private-equity fund
it raised in 2007. Last year, it acquired a 19 million-pound
stake in Chris Corbin and  Jeremy King ’s Rex Restaurant
Associates. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on
the size of the investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
