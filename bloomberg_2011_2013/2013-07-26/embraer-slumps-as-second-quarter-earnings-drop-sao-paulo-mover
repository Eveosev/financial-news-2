Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the Brazilian planemaker
that has led gains on the  Ibovespa (IBOV)  this year, slumped after
posting quarterly earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates as
jets deliveries declined.  The shares fell 4.7 percent to 20.02 reais at 12:44 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier declining as much as 5.1 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since April 17. It was the worst
performance on the Ibovespa equity benchmark, which lost 0.4
percent.  Embraer’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 19 percent to 427.1 million reais ($189.5
million) in the second quarter of this year from 2012, according
to a regulatory filing yesterday after the market closed. That
compares with an average estimate of 441.9 million reais among
ten analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company delivered 22
commercial jets, compared with 35 in the prior period, according
to the filing.  “The lower number of deliveries of commercial aircraft is
still reflecting last year’s poor backlog impacted by worries
about global macroeconomic conditions,” Banco Bradesco SA
analysts led by Edigimar Maximiliano Jr. wrote today in a note
to clients.  The Sao Jose dos Campos-based Embraer planemaker has
climbed 39 percent this year, compared with a 20 percent drop in
the Ibovespa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
