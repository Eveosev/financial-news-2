Cattle futures gained the most in a
week on speculation that mild U.S. weather will lead to higher
beef demand as more Americans grill outdoors. Hog prices fell.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.4 percent to $1.8766, the biggest
increase in four weeks, U.S. Department of Agriculture data
show. Most of the Midwest will have below normal temperatures in
the next six to 10 days after a recent heat wave, according to
MDA Weather Services. Hot weather can slow grilling demand as
fewer consumers cook outdoors.  “Packers may see some increased business next week as
retailers feature more beef coming into the first of August, and
of course the high heat throughout much of the country has
subsided,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle
Brokerage LLC in Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report.
“Higher beef-trim markets and steady ground-beef markets
yesterday could be a precursor to some of this increased
business.”  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$1.261 a pound at 9:52 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
A close at that level would be the biggest gain since July 18.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.52775 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.7 percent to
85.35 cents a pound. Prices fell 0.8 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
