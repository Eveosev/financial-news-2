Safran SA (SAF) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
maker of  aircraft engines , raised its 2013 profit forecast after
increasing demand for spare parts drove a 23 percent jump in
first-half operating profit.  Adjusted recurring operating income will rise by about 20
percent this year, Safran said today in a  statement . That
compares with a previous prediction of a “mid-teens”
percentage increase in earnings. The company reiterated a
forecast, raised in April, that revenue will jump by a
percentage in the “mid-to-high single digits.”  The improvement in first-half figures was primarily driven
by aerospace activities in propulsion and by equipment, Safran
said. The Paris-based company also benefited from favorable
trends in the after market, or sales of spare engines and parts
for airliners already flying. Safran builds powerplants for
single-aisle planes made by  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS.  “This was a strong result,” Robert Stallard, a London-based analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  said in a note. “The after
market and guidance raise giving investors ample reason for
interest.”  Sustained Improvement  The strong growth in spare parts and commercial engine
sales should continue for the rest of the year and into 2014,
Chief Financial Officer Ross McInnes said in a Bloomberg
Television interview today. Spare-parts sales saw 24 percent
growth compared to the year-earlier period, when the business
was weak, he said.  The company expects its joint venture with  General Electric
Co. (GE)  to build more than 1,400 CFM56 engines for Boeing’s 737
model and Airbus’s A320s this year. The partners also have
combined to secure more than 5,000 orders for the CFM56’s
replacement, the Leap-X powerplant, McInnes said.  Safran  fell  as much as 0.5 percent to 41.77 euros,
reversing an increase earlier in the day, and was trading down
0.4 percent at 1:06 p.m. in Paris. The stock has gained 31
percent this year, valuing the manufacturer at 17.8 billion
euros ($23.7 billion).  First-half recurring  operating income , which excludes one-time gains or costs, rose to 847 million euros from a restated
687 million euros a year earlier, Safran said. Net income surged
59 percent to 658 million euros, while revenue increased 10
percent to 7.07 billion euros.  The company is targeting about 40 percent of free  cash flow 
on adjusted recurring operating income. Meeting the target is
challenging, and will depend on government payments in the
second half, Safran said in a presentation to analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
