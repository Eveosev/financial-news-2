Christine Lagarde , managing director of the International Monetary Fund, was in Washington, D.C. last night celebrating the birth of George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.  British Ambassador  Peter Westmacott , host of the reception, joked it was pegged to the release of the British economy’s growth figures. He then gave a champagne toast welcoming the first son of  Prince William  and the former Kate Middleton.  Lagarde chatted with guests who included former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan , Senator  Roy Blunt , Missouri Republican, White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and Secretary of Homeland Security  Janet Napolitano , who’s stepping down in September. They were served Yorkshire pudding and British cheeses on the terrace of the ambassador’s residence.  Inside was a cake bearing the baby prince’s title. Nearby, was a photo collage of the royal family with a picture of the Duke of Cambridge and his mother, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.  Benjamin Chang, a senior vice president with Albright Stonebridge Group, wore a Union Jack belt.  Goldman Liquidation  The  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  logo was spotted in a painting last night at Art Southampton, the third art fair to open on the East End of  Long Island  this month.  “Liquidated Goldman Sachs,” by French artist  Aghirre “Zevs” Schwarz , features the firm’s name in yellow paint dripping down a blue canvas. It’s priced at $14,000.  “It’s for someone in finance or for art collectors who may have lost money in the financial crisis who just think it’s a joke they’re pulling on themselves,” said David De Buck, the dealer exhibiting the work. At preview’s end, it hadn’t sold, though two others featuring the  Louis Vuitton (MC)  logo had.  Schwarz has “liquidated” well-known logos for years. Tech companies get the treatment in his solo show at  De Buck Gallery  opening on Sept. 12.  Art Southampton  runs through Monday in a 100,000-square-foot (9,290 square meters) tent, with more than 90 exhibitors including 21 from outside the U.S. Last night, preview visitors included Matthew Mark of Jet Capital Investors LP, his father-in-law, Stanford Warshawsky of Bismarck Capital LLC, and Richard Avedon’s muse China Machado.  “There’s a lot to see here,” said dealer  Eli Klein , who’s showing a bust of a Roman youth made of paper, by Li Hongbo, priced at $24,000.  Pace Show  Pace Prints is showing John Alexander, who also has an exhibition at Guild Hall in  East Hampton . At Mike Weiss Gallery’s stand, vivid, impressionistic paintings by Jan de Vleigher are standouts.  “This is more accessible than Frieze,” art adviser Randy Scott said. “There’s a lot more painting and narrative stuff.”  “It’s about quality, luxury, and lifestyle,” said Nick Korniloff, owner of the fair, in its second year.  “We even have Jay Z’s cognac,” he said, hoisting up his drink made with  D’USSE Cognac . “When the art is in the right context, people respond.”  New Orleans Jazz  Broadcast journalist Soledad O’Brien and her husband, Brad Raymond, co-head of investment banking at  Stifel Financial Corp (SF) , had dinner with fashion designer  Donna Karan  last night at her  Urban Zen Studio  in New York’s West Village.  The occasion was a fundraiser for the couple’s foundation, which gives tuition assistance to underprivileged women.  Other guests were jazz trumpeter  Irvin Mayfield  and “The Trip to Bountiful” producer Stephen Byrd.  Formerly an anchor at Cable News Network, O’Brien is now a contributor to HBO’s “Real Sports” and  Al Jazeera . She and her husband formed the  Soledad O’Brien + Brad Raymond Starfish Foundation  in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Mayfield and his New Orleans Jazz Orchestra performed at the event.
