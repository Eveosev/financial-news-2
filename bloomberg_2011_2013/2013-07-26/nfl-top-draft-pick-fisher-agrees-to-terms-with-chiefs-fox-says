Eric Fisher, the top pick in the
National Football League’s April draft by the  Kansas City
Chiefs , agreed on a four-year contract with the team, according
to Fox Sports.  Fisher, an offensive tackle who played at Central Michigan
University, agreed to the deal before today’s first practice of
training camp and is en route to St. Joseph, Missouri, to sign
his contract and join the team, the  website  reported, citing the
Chiefs.  Per the NFL rookie scale, Fisher’s contract will be worth
about $22 million, with a team option for a fifth year,
according to Fox.  Fisher, 6-foot-7 and 306 pounds, started 34 of 42 games he
appeared in for Central Michigan and was an All-Mid American
Conference first-team selection as a senior.  The Chiefs received the top pick in the draft after going
2-14 last season, tied with the  Jacksonville Jaguars  for the
worst record among the NFL’s 32 teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
