Rubber fell for a second day as
 Japan ’s currency strengthened on speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will maintain bond purchases, cutting the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  The most-active contract lost as much as 2.2 percent to
250.2 yen a kilogram ($2,529 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange and traded at 252.1 yen at 1:06 p.m. local
time. The price has gained 0.2 percent this week, bringing this
year’s loss to 17 percent. Rubber for delivery in January, which
started trading today, was quoted at 252.6 yen.  The yen strengthened for a second day against the dollar on
speculation the Federal Reserve will reassure investors that
policy will remain accommodative at next week’s meeting, and
ahead of reports next week predicted to show economic expansion
in the second quarter and jobs growth in July slowed.  “A strong yen cuts the appeal of rubber contracts,” said
Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka Shoji Co.
“Investors also reduced positions ahead of a FOMC meeting and
reports next week on U.S. economic data.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee , which will meet July 30-31, won’t announce a decision to reduce its monthly bond
purchases at that meeting, according to 54 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News  from July 18-22. Half of those polled said Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will trim bond buying to $65 billion
from the current pace of $85 billion in September.  A July 31 report may show U.S. annualized gross domestic
product grew 1 percent in the April-to-June period, slowing from
the previous three-month period, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg poll. Employers added 184,000 jobs this
month, after 195,000 additional positions were created in June,
a separate poll forecast before the Aug. 2 data release.  Rubber for January delivery fell 1.4 percent to 18,305  yuan 
($2,985) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 79.30 baht ($2.55) a kilogram
yesterday, according to Rubber Research Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
