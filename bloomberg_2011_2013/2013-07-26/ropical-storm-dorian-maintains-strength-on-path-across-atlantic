Tropical Storm Dorian became less
organized and may weaken as it moves across open waters of the
Atlantic, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.  Dorian, with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80
kilometers) per hour, was about 1,425 miles east of the northern
Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest at 20 mph, according
to a  center advisory  before 5 a.m. in  New York .  “Slow weakening is expected during the next day or so,”
according to the advisory. The storm is forecast to turn toward
the west with an increase in forward speed through Saturday. The
center’s five-day  projection  has Dorian passing north of or over
 Puerto Rico  on July 29.  Dorian is the fourth tropical storm of the  Atlantic
hurricane season , which runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. From
1966 to 2009, the fourth system typically formed by Aug. 23,
according to the hurricane center.  Commodities traders follow Atlantic systems because they
can affect oil and natural gas production as well as orange
crops. The U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  is home to about 6 percent of
U.S. natural gas output, 23 percent of oil production and more
than 40 percent of petroleum refining capacity, according to the
Energy Department. The Bay of Campeche, at the southern end of
the Gulf, is where  Petroleos Mexicanos , Mexico’s state-owned oil
company, produces most of that country’s crude.  To contact the reporters on this story:
