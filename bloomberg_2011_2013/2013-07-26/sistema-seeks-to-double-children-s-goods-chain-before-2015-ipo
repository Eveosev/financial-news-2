AFK Sistema (SSA)  is seeking to double the
size of its children’s goods retailer,  Detsky Mir , before
selling a stake in an initial public offering in 2015,
billionaire Chairman Vladimir Evtushenkov said.  Detsky Mir,  Russia ’s largest retailer of children’s goods,
 increased  sales 14 percent last year to $893 million as it
opened more regional stores. The Russian retail market for
children’s goods rose 10.5 percent to $14 billion, according to
Renaissance Capital.  “We are considering different options to grow our retail
business as we plan an IPO of Detsky Mir for 2015,” billionaire
Evtushenkov said in a Bloomberg interview this week. “Until
then, we hope to double our network, both organically and
through acquisitions.”  Sistema bought back 25 percent of Detsky Mir, a brand that
dates back to Soviet times, from lender  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  earlier
this month, for 4.5 billion rubles ($138 million). The deal
restored its 100 percent ownership after the state-controlled
lender bought the stake in 2010.  Evtushenkov declined to comment on a possible valuation for
the IPO.  Last year, Detsky Mir acquired the Russian franchise of
Early Learning Centre Ltd., which had 20 stores at the end of
2012, and opened 47 stores under its own brand. That boosted the
retailer’s store count to 216 by the end of the year, while
selling space rose 23 percent to 291,000 square meters (3.13
million square feet),according to a company  report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
