Copper futures tumbled the most in
three weeks after  China  ordered companies in 19 industries to
cut manufacturing capacity, signaling lower demand for
industrial metals.  Surplus capacity must be idled by September and eliminated
by year-end, the Chinese government said yesterday. A report on
July 24 showed July manufacturing weakened more than estimated
in the Asian nation, the world’s top consumer of copper. A
basket of prices on the London Metal Exchange also dropped the
most in three weeks.  “Everything we hear out of China now is about a slowdown
and how they’re not buying copper, and this announcement just
adds to those concerns,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “China is a
big buyer of copper, so this is a problem.”  Copper futures for delivery in September slid 2.5 percent
to $3.1055 a pound at 1:17 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the
biggest decline for a most-active contract since July 5. The
price has dropped 15 percent this year.  China plans to shut 654,400 metric tons of copper capacity
and 260,000 tons for aluminum as part of the initial goal,
Bloomberg calculations based on the government’s statement show.  The country produced 5.82 million tons of refined copper
and 20.8 million tons of aluminum last year, according to
Barclays Plc. Supplies will exceed demand for both metals,
Barclays said.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 2.2 percent to $6,862 a ton ($3.11 a pound).
Aluminum declined 1.6 percent to $1,794.50, the lowest
settlement since July 9. Zinc, nickel and lead dropped, while
tin rose.  An LME  gauge  of the six metals slumped 1.8 percent to
2,976.4. The index has dropped 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
