Pope Francis greeted thousands of
Catholic followers who lined  Rio de Janeiro ’s Copacabana beach
yesterday while urging the faithful to live a humble life and
reject the trappings of greed and materialism.  “Money and power can offer a moment of drunkenness -- the
illusion of being happy,” he said in a speech during his week-long visit to Brazil for World Youth Day. “We wind up full, but
not fed. It’s sad to see youth that’s full, but weak.”  The pope rode along the beach in an open-air vehicle that
allowed him to interact with crowds lining the boulevard,
blessing baby after baby. Navy ships tracked the police convoy
just beyond the breaking waves. Brazilian youngsters sang and
danced for him on stage, and he called the attendees “true
warriors” for braving the rain.  In one of his first papal addresses in March, Francis said
he wished “for a church that is poor and for the poor” and has
eschewed many of the luxuries afforded to foreign dignitaries
during his first trip abroad to  Brazil  this week. The pontiff
carried his own baggage onto the flight to Rio and rode from the
airport in a hatchback car.  Instead of the ornate robes favored by his predecessors,
Pope Francis typically wears a simple white robe and iron cross.
Earlier yesterday, he visited a slum where he called on society
to care for the marginalized.  To contact the reporter on this story:
