Ibovespa  futures  dropped, a sign the
equity gauge may pare a weekly gain, as  China  ordered companies
in 19 industries to cut production capacity, adding to concern
that demand is set to slow in Brazil’s top trading partner.  Localiza Rent a Car SA ,  Latin America ’s biggest car-rental
company, may move after saying it plans to buy back as many as
9.04 million shares over the next year. Plane maker  Embraer SA (EMBR3) 
may be active after reporting an unexpected loss.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August fell 0.3
percent to 48,940 at 9:13 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real declined
0.1 percent to 2.2446 per dollar. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials fell 0.5 percent after China ordered
more than 1,400 companies to cut excess production capacity this
year, part of the country’s efforts to shift toward slower,
more-sustainable economic growth.  “In  Brazil , equities should fall, given the worsening of
the external outlook,” Banco Bradesco SA’s economic team wrote
in a note to clients today. “Commodities are trading lower,
reacting to increased concern about China’s economic outlook.”  Commodities producers account for about 38 percent of the
Ibovespa’s weighting.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge slumped 19 percent this
year through yesterday, wiping out $227 billion from the  value 
of Brazilian equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Ibovespa trades at 12.4 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.4 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 6 billion reais
yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.7 billion
reais this year through July 24, according to data  compiled  by
the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
