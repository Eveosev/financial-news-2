French  consumer confidence  jumped in
July as a rise in jobless claims that began two years ago
started to slow.  Household sentiment  increased to 82 in July from a revised
79 in June, national statistics office Insee said today in an e-mailed statement. Economists expected a reading of 79, according
to the median of 15 estimates gathered by  Bloomberg News .  The increase, the biggest for the index since July 2011, is
the latest indicator to suggest that Europe’s second-largest
economy is at least beginning to stabilize after dipping into
recession in the first quarter. Labor Ministry data this week
showed that  jobless claims  increased by 14,900 in June and 100
in May, compared with increases of between 18,400 and 43,900 in
the previous four months. Youth unemployment has fallen for two
consecutive months.  “The slowdown comes before the reversal,” Labor Minister
Michel Sapin said yesterday on  Europe  1 radio yesterday.  Business confidence is also improving. Sentiment among
factory executives increased to the highest in 15 months in
July, Insee said earlier this week.  Today’s report showed consumers believe their personal
financial situations are improving, that their ability to save
is rising and their readiness to make large purchases is
growing. Fewer are expecting unemployment to keep rising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
