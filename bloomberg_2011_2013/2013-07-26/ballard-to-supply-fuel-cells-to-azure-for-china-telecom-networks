Ballard Power Systems Inc. (BLD) , a
manufacturer of fuel cells for buses and backup power, agreed to
provide 220 systems to  China ’s Azure Hydrogen Energy Science &
Technology Corp.  The agreement comprises 120 direct-hydrogen systems and 100
fueled by methanol and all will be delivered by year-end,
according to a statement today from Burnaby, British Columbia-based Ballard. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.  The fuel-cell systems will provide backup power for
telecommunication networks in China.  Ballard in May agreed to develop fuel-cell buses with
Beijing-based Azure Hydrogen. Ballard gained 1.4 percent to
$2.11 at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
