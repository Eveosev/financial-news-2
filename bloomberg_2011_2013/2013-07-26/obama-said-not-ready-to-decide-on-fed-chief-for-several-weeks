President  Barack Obama  won’t
announce a replacement for Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke at least until September, according to an 
administration official.  Obama hasn’t made a decision on naming the next Fed chief,
according to the official, who asked for anonymity to discuss
internal planning.  Bernanke, whose second four-year term expires Jan. 31,
hasn’t indicated whether he would seek or accept a third term.
Obama said last month that the Fed chairman has stayed in the
post “longer than he wanted.”  The Associated Press reported the timing earlier today.  About a third of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate have
signed a letter pressing Obama to nominate Fed Vice Chairman
Janet Yellen for the post. While the letter doesn’t name any
other candidate, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers is
another potential nominee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
