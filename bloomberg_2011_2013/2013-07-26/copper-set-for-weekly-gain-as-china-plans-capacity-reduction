Copper was poised for a weekly
advance as  China , the biggest user, plans to eliminate obsolete
production capacity.  Copper for delivery in three months was little changed at
$7,016.75 a metric ton at 10:22 a.m. in  Shanghai  and has gained
1.5 percent this week. Aluminum was also little changed at
$1,825 a ton.  China’s industry ministry ordered more than 1,400 companies
in 19 industries, including aluminum and copper, to cut
production capacity this year, according to a statement on its
website yesterday.  Canceled warrants , or orders to remove copper
from LME warehouses, fell to 316,625 tons yesterday, the lowest
since June 21, while those in Asia slid to 194,925 tons, the
lowest since June 24.  “It’ll take some time before the market can see why this
capacity elimination is different from previous efforts and
won’t lead to further additions of new capacity,” said Xiong Dabiao, an analyst at Minmetals Futures Co. in Shanghai. “Slow
industrial activity continues to weigh on prices.”  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 50,400  yuan  ($8,218) a ton. Metal
for delivery in September on the Comex was little changed at
$3.1855 a pound. On the LME, zinc, lead, nickel and tin were
also little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
