GMAC Mortgage, part of the home
lending unit owned by  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , will pay $230 million
to compensate borrowers for improper handling of foreclosures,
the Federal Reserve said today in a statement.  GMAC Mortgage will pay about 232,000 borrowers to settle
claims it improperly seized homes, the Fed said. In a deal
similar to those regulators struck with 13 other mortgage
servicers this year, the money goes to borrowers who faced
foreclosure in 2009 and 2010.  Settlements reached since January with 14 of the largest
U.S. mortgage servicers, total more than $3.8 billion, will
close the books on mishandled foreclosures after the 2008 credit
crisis. GMAC Mortgage’s deal -- approved by the court overseeing
the bankruptcy -- ends a process the company agreed to in 2011
to have individual foreclosures reviewed for harm.  “We’re relieved to be able to distribute these funds
directly to borrowers rather than spend the time and money with
consultants to complete the file review,” Tammy Hamzehpour, a
spokeswoman for Residential Capital -- part of the Ally mortgage
unit placed into bankruptcy last year -- said in an e-mailed
statement. “That process would not have returned anywhere near
as much money, to as many potentially harmed borrowers, as will
this settlement.”  The company settled without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The payments will come from the Residential Capital
estate, Hamzehpour said.  Federal Bailout  Ally, formerly known as GMAC Inc., was owned by  General
Motors (GM)  Corp. until 2006, when the automaker sold 51 percent to
private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. The U.S.
took a 74 percent stake in 2008 in return for financial aid that
kept the lender from collapsing under bad loans.  Mortgage servicers including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of
America Corp. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Morgan Stanley (MS)  were
accused of engaging in improper foreclosure methods in 2009 and
2010, including so-called robo-signing of documents. Most of
their settlement money has already been sent to borrowers in
checks ranging from $300 to about $125,000. The Fed didn’t
release details of Ally’s payment plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
