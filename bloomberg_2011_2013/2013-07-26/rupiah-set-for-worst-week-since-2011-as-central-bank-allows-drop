Indonesia ’s rupiah fell by the most
since September 2011 this week as the central bank allows a more
rapid slide toward levels quoted in the offshore market.
 Government bonds  declined.  The currency is moving toward a new equilibrium that is in
line with economic fundamentals, Bank Indonesia said in a July
23 statement after the rupiah dropped the most in 13 months that
day. The 2012 current-account deficit was the largest since 1996,
while the country recorded trade shortfalls in seven of the
eight months through May, official data show. Foreign-exchange
reserves dropped below $100 billion in June for the first time
since February 2011, according to the central bank.  “ Bank Indonesia  has started allowing larger rupiah
depreciation to maintain foreign reserves and boost exports,”
said Dian Ayu Yustina, an economist at PT Bank Danamon Indonesia
in Jakarta. “I’m still pessimistic toward our external balance
as our trading partners have not shown sustainable recovery, so
that will weigh on our trade deficit.”  The rupiah declined 1.8 percent this week to 10,266 per
dollar as of 3:46 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show.
The spot rate reached a four-year low of 10,286 yesterday and
was steady today. It traded at a 2 percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which weakened 1.1 percent in
the last five days to 10,473.  Worst Performer  The monetary authority has allowed the rupiah to gradually
decline, Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said July 12. It has lost
3.3 percent against the dollar this month, the most among the 11
most-traded Asian currencies. The one-month forwards were as
much as 5 percent stronger than the spot rate in June.  A  fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  that is
used to settle the forwards was set at 10,277, compared with
10,170 on July 19. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
81 basis points this week to 12.52 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 rose nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, this week to 7.96
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. The yield closed at a two-week low of 7.43 percent
on July 23 after reaching 8.3 percent last week, the highest
since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
