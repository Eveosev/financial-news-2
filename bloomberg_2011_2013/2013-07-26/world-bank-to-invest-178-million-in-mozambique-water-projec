The  World Bank  agreed to invest $178
million to increase access to clean water for residents of
greater Maputo,  Mozambique ’s largest urban area.  The funds will support the Greater Maputo Water Supply
Expansion Project under the government’s National Urban Water
Supply and Sanitation Strategy and contribute toward the third
Poverty Reduction Action Plan 2011-14, Laurence C. Clarke, World
Bank Country Director for Mozambique, said in a  statement  today.  About 17 percent of children under the age of five die from
diarrheal diseases, primarily caused by the consumption of
unclean water and poor sanitation in the country, according to
Luiz Claudio Martins Tavares, the project’s team leader.  “We are happy to support this project that will bring
improved health and water security to over 100,000 families
living in the greater Maputo area,” Clarke said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
