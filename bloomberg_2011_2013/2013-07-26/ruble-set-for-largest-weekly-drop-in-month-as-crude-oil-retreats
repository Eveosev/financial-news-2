The ruble headed for the biggest
weekly loss in five on concern declining  oil prices  will curb
earnings for the world’s biggest energy exporter.  The currency slid for a fifth day, dropping 0.1 percent to
37.4866 against the dollar-euro basket by 3:57 p.m. in Moscow, a
1.7 percent drop in the week. The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent
versus the dollar to 32.6775 and by less than 0.1 percent to the
euro to 43.3810.  Crude fell as much as 1.1 percent to $104.34 per barrel in
 New York  today, poised for a 3.3 percent drop in the week. The
oil and natural-gas industries contribute about 50 percent of
 Russia ’s budget revenue. The central bank sold 6.47 billion
rubles ($198 million) on July 24 to slow the currency’s drop,
according to its website.  “The ruble has been declining this week as traders were
looking at the oil price drop,” Artem Roschin, a foreign-exchange trader at Aljba Alliance, said by phone from Moscow.
“We’re expecting the decline to continue.”  Russia’s ruble bonds due February 2027 rose for a third
day, lowering the yield one basis point to 7.74 percent. The
yield on so-called OFZs due January 2023 climbed one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.36 percent.  Non-resident holdings of ruble-denominated sovereign notes
are now approaching the emerging-market average of 30 percent,
compared with 21 percent on Feb. 1 and 7 percent on July 1,
2012, the Moscow-based central bank said in a report today. Bank
Rossii and the Finance Ministry plan to start monitoring foreign
ownership of OFZs to reduce risks.  The ruble rallied last week as investors speculated that
the  Federal Reserve  will keep stimulus measures in place,
boosting appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers last week that the
central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond purchases “could be
reduced more quickly or expanded” depending on the pace of
recovery in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emerging Currencies Index was little
changed at 91.191.  To contact the reporter on this story:
