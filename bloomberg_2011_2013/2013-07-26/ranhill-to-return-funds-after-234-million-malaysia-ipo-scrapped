Ranhill Energy and Resources Bhd. , a
Malaysian energy and water company, scrapped its 753 million
ringgit ($234 million) initial public offering less than a week
before the stock was slated to debut in Kuala Lumpur.  All funds collected from investors will be returned,
Ranhill said today in a statement. The company was ordered
yesterday by  Malaysia ’s Securities Commission to postpone the
listing after an affiliate got a suspension notice from state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd.  Petronas suspended Perunding Ranhill Worley Sdn., a company
90 percent-owned by Ranhill Energy’s Chief Executive Officer
Hamdan Mohamad, after a review of its construction work on a
project in Malaysia’s southern state of Malacca, according to a
stock exchange filing on July 24. This firm has an exclusive
arrangement to appoint Ranhill WorleyParsons Sdn. for projects
won in the nation, it said. Ranhill WorleyParsons is jointly
owned by Ranhill Energy and  WorleyParsons Ltd. (WOR) ,  Australia ’s
biggest oil and gas engineering company.  Petronas lifted the suspension on the Ranhill affiliate or
groups connected to it for upstream activities, Ranhill said in
the statement today. The suspension on downstream activities
still applies to any companies or shareholders linked to the
Ranhill affiliate.  The stock was due to debut July 31. The decision to scrap
the IPO was made after consulting with its adviser Maybank
Investment Bank Bhd. and joint global coordinators Maybank and
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd., Ranhill said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
