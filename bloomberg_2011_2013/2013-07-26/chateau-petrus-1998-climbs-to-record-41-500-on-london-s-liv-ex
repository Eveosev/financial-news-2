A case of  Chateau Petrus  1998, one
of the two most expensive estates in Bordeaux, sold for a record
27,000 pounds ($41,500) on Liv-ex as investors sought rare older
vintages even as demand in the broader wine market cooled.  The transaction yesterday was 4 percent above a similar
trade in April and 9 percent up from its level two years ago. It
has tripled in price on the exchange in the past eight years.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 4 percent this
year, with gains in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared by a drop
since then. While the index, a benchmark for top wines from
Bordeaux, is heading for its fourth straight month of declines
following a muted response to the sales campaign for the
region’s 2012 wine futures, appetite persists for top producers.  “Petrus still seems to be in demand,” Stephen Mould, head
of Sotheby’s European wine department, said by phone following
an auction held in  London  earlier this month.  Petrus topped Bordeaux lots at that  Sotheby’s  sale on July
17, with 11 bottles of the 1990 vintage fetching 25,850 pounds.  The 1998 vintage of Chateau Petrus is the third most
expensive of the past 20 years, according to merchant prices
collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The wine was awarded a 98 rating on a 100-point scale by
U.S. critic  Robert Parker , putting it in the top six vintages
during that period, according to the eRobertParker.com  website .  Chateau Petrus has 28 acres (11 hectares) planted with red-grape vines, of which 95 percent are Merlot and 5 percent
Cabernet Franc. Fermentation is in temperature-controlled
concrete tanks and the young wine matured in new oak barrels.  The vineyard is situated in Pomerol on the right bank of
the Dordogne river.  To contact the reporter on this story:
