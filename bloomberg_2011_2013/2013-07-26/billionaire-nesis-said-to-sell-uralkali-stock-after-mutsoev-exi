Billionaire  Alexander Nesis  sold
shares in OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest potash producer, two
weeks after the company bought out fellow shareholder Zelimkhan Mutsoev for $1.3 billion, according to three people with
knowledge of the matter.  Nesis sold his stock this month, the people said, asking
not to be identified as the information is private. They didn’t
provide any additional details before an official statement.  Nesis held 5.1 percent of the Berezniki, Russia-based
fertilizer producer at the end of April, which would be valued
at about $870 million at today’s market price.  Nesis bought into Uralkali together with billionaires
Suleiman Kerimov and Filaret Galchev in 2010. The company in
April said that he reduced his stake to 5.1 percent from 9.94
percent.  Uralkali’s shares fell 13 percent in Moscow in the first
four days of this week, before climbing as much as 4.3 percent
today in Moscow. The company is carrying out a $1.6 billion
buyback from the market, with purchases totalling $1.25 billion
as of July 19, according to a company statement.  The press services of Nesis’s ICT Group and Uralkali  press
service declined to comment for the story.  Mutsoev agreed in June to sell his 189 million shares, a
stake of about 6.4 percent, for 217.3 rubles a share. Uralkali
traded up 2.1 percent at 190.40 rubles by 5:21 p.m. in Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
