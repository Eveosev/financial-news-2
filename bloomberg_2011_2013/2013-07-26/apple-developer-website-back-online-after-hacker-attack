Apple Inc. (AAPL)  put its website for
software developers back online today, more than a week after a
hacker broke into the network and tried to steal personal
information.  Apple took the site, used by engineers who write
applications for iPhones, Macs and other products, offline on
July 18 after a hacker tried to steal basic information, the
Cupertino, California-based company said. The  site  was active
as of 5 p.m. local time.  Developers use the site for software downloads,
documentation and engineering information. The maker of iPhones
and iPads said this week that it’s “completely overhauling”
its developer systems to prevent a security threat from
happening again. While some of the website’s information was
encrypted, Apple said it hadn’t been able to rule out whether
names, mailing addresses or e-mail addresses may have been
accessed.  Some of the website’s features were back online, Apple
said.  “We appreciate your patience as we work to bring our
developer services back online,” the company said in a
statement. “Certificates, identifiers & profiles, software
downloads, and other developer services are now available.”  Apple said it would extend memberships for any users if
their accounts were due to expire while the website is offline.
Apple apologized for “significant inconvenience” that the
outage caused for software developers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
