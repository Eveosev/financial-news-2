  Balfour Beatty Plc (BBY) , the U.K.
engineering group, and investor Equitix Ltd. were appointed the
preferred bidder for 346 million pounds ($533 million) of power
links at an  RWE AG (RWE)  wind farm off the U.K.  The companies will own and operate the transmission assets
for the 576-megawatt Gwynt y Mor wind farm being built by RWE
Npower Renewables Ltd. off the North Wales coast, energy
regulator Ofgem said today in a statement.  Balfour and London-based Equitix were selected after a
tender process developed by the U.K. Department of Energy and
Climate Change and Ofgem, where bidders compete to own links for
offshore wind farms. The next tender will start later this year,
Ofgem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
