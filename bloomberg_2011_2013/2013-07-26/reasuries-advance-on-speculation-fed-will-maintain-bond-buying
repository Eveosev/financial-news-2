Treasuries rose for a second day on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
won’t signal a change next week in its program of $85 billion a
month in bond purchases.  Benchmark 10-year securities fluctuated earlier as a gauge
of July  consumer confidence  exceeded forecasts.  U.S. debt  is
poised to end two weeks of gains after the U.S. sold $99 billion
of notes over the previous three days, including seven-year debt
at the highest yield since July 2011. Analysts predict data next
week will show American  home prices  rose at the fastest in seven
years in May and the jobless rate fell this month.  “I don’t expect any surprises from the Fed given how many
times Bernanke’s spoken in the past six weeks,” said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as the head of fixed-income
trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth Management unit in
 New York . “They’re going to reiterate the talking points that
we’ve heard.”  U.S. 10-year  note yields  fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.56 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
benchmark 1.75 percent security maturing in May 2023 rose 2/32,
or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 93. The yield has
increased eight basis points this week.  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 0.3 percent since the
end of June, with the securities poised for a third monthly
decline, the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  shows. For the
year, the index has fallen 2.6 percent. The MSCI World Index of
shares has returned 5.9 percent in July and 13 percent in 2013,
including reinvested dividends.  Economic Data  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S. consumer sentiment rose to 85.1 in July from 84.1 the prior
month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 84
in the final July gauge after a preliminary reading of 83.9.  The  S&P/Case-Shiller index  of U.S. home prices increased
12.4 percent in May from a year earlier, which would be the
biggest gain since February 2006, a separate Bloomberg survey
showed before the report on July 30. The U.S.  unemployment rate 
fell to 7.5 percent in July from 7.6 percent in June, while
payrolls climbed by 185,000, according to economists before the
Labor Department releases the figures on Aug. 2.  “Even if the headline payroll gain is near consensus, the
market is not accounting for the risk of a sudden drop in the
 unemployment rate ,” Barclays Plc strategists led by Rajiv Setia
in New York wrote in a research note. “Investors should brace
themselves for the likelihood of a further selloff.”  Yields on 10-year notes are likely to climb faster than
those on 30-year bonds, the analysts forecast.  Trading Levels  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell to $195 billion
today, from $352 billion yesterday, the highest level since July
17 and above this year’s average of about $320 billion.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index increased to 82.6
yesterday from 80.2 the previous day. The gauge has fallen from
117.89 on July 5, which was the highest since December 2010.  Primary dealers won 34.9 percent of the $29 billion of
seven-year notes auctioned yesterday, the least since December
2010. The securities were sold at a high yield of 2.026 percent,
up from 1.932 percent at the previous auction on June 27.
Investors submitted a below-average number of bids at the $35
billion offerings of two-year notes on July 23 and five-year
notes on July 24.  ‘Trending Up’  “The primary-dealer community wasn’t left with a whole lot
of supply to distribute,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income
in New York at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., which as one
of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers is obligated to bid in U.S. debt
sales. “That’s why the market is trending up a little bit.”  The Fed purchased $1.46 billion of Treasury bonds maturing
from February 2036 to November 2042 as part of its quantitative-easing program intended to stimulate growth through capping
borrowing costs.  The central bank, which has been buying  $85 billion  of
bonds each month, will probably start trimming purchases in
September, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  next meets to review
policy on July 30-31. The central bank has kept its  target  for
overnight bank lending in a range from zero to 0.25 percent
since December 2008.  The FOMC said in a June 19 statement that leaving the
federal-funds rate in that range “will be appropriate at least
as long” as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
forecast for inflation in one-to-two years doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent. Bernanke said on July 17 the jobless rate isn’t the
only measure of labor-market health.  Note Bets  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
from a net-long position to a net-short position in 10-year note
futures in the week ending July 23, according to U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 32,312 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-long 17,735
contracts.  Traders increased their net-long position in 2-year note
futures, with long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbering short positions by 31,995 contracts, the most since
May 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
