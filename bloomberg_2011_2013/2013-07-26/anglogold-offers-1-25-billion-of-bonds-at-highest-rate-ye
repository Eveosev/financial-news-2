AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  offered
investors $1.25 billion of bonds at the highest rate of any of
the third-biggest producer of the metal’s debt.  It will use the net proceeds of about $1.2 billion on the
notes that will yield 8.5 percent at par to repay other debt and
for general corporate purposes, the Johannesburg-based company
said today in a statement. The offer closes on July 30, it said.
AngloGold also started an offer to buy back all of the $732.5
million of bonds due in May 2014 that can be converted into
stock.  The company is selling the debt after having its rating cut
to the highest junk level by  Standard & Poor’s  on July 17 and to
the lowest investment grade at Moody’s Investors Service five
days earlier. AngloGold plans to write down the value of its
assets and stockpiles by as much as $2.6 billion after the price
of gold plunged. Gold has slipped 21 percent this year,
including a record three-month drop in the second quarter.  “It is easier to buy it out right now,”  David Davis , an
analyst at SBG Securities Ltd. in Johannesburg, said of the
convertible debt by phone. “It will be more expensive later.”  The company will pay $1,015 for each $1,000 of principal on
the convertible bonds, together with accrued and unpaid
interest. The offer expires on Aug. 21.  Yields on AngloGold’s dollar debt due in April 2020 surged
to a record 7.83 percent on July 25 and were trading at 7.70
percent by 11:18 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
