On November 8, 1519, just outside
what is now Mexico City, conquistador Hernan Cortes attended a
ceremonial dinner given by Montezuma II.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The Aztec king was not sure whether Cortes was friend or
foe. He’d carried out his daily ritual, which involved killing
and eating specially fattened young people, but it had not
enlightened him.  Montezuma preferred to dine in private behind a screen,
but when he was done, the royal feast was taken to the
conquistadors, more than 300 dishes. There were white tortillas
and various breads, fruit and cocoa to accompany the crocks of
roast duck, rabbit, turkey, pheasant and venison.  As they dug in, the Europeans were disconcerted to find
that some of the dishes contained human arms and legs.  I spoke with William Sitwell, author of “A History of Food
in 100 Recipes,” on the following topics:  1. Great vs. Terrible Food.  2. Cannibals & Chocolate.  3. Italy Loves Pasta.  4. Taste & Availability.  5. Foodie Trends.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
