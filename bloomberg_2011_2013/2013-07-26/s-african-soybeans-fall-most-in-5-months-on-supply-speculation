South African soybean futures
declined the most in five months as expectations of increased
supply in the U.S. drove prices down.  Soybeans for delivery in September, the most active
contract, fell 2.5 percent, the most since Feb. 26, to 5,041
rand ($518) a metric ton by the noon close on the South African
Futures Exchange.  “Soy closed in the negative and possibly dragged the whole
market down as fears that some export contracts are going to be
canceled in the U.S. due to excess supply,” Melanie van der
Linde, a trader at South Africa-based Suidwes Ltd., said over
the phone today. “Although this is yet to be confirmed, traders
may have been hedging their bets.”  Soybeans for delivery in November slumped to $12.09 a
bushel, the lowest in 17 months, on the Chicago Board of Trade
as demand for U.S. supplies fell. The Department of Agriculture
predicts soybean stockpiles may reach 74.1 million tons this
year.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, declined 1 percent to 2,305 rand while the yellow
variety for delivery in September fell 1.7 percent to 2,117
rand.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest producer of corn.
The white grain is a staple food in the country, while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
