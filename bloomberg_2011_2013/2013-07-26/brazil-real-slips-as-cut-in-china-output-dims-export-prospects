Brazil ’s real fell as  China  ordered
more than 1,400 companies to cut excess production capacity,
dimming prospects for the South American country’s exporters.  The currency depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.2438 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:25 a.m. in  Sao Paulo  and has risen 0.2 percent this
week. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January climbed one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.77 percent, up three
basis points from July 19.  “There’s a new reality in China,” Flavio Serrano, senior
economist at Banco Espirito de Investimento SA in Sao Paulo,
said in a telephone interview. “We used to have a very
favorable scenario of commodity prices, but now the real should
stay between 2.2 and 2.3 per dollar and it will be tough to
return to 2.1.”  The real has tumbled 11 percent in the past three months,
the biggest drop among 24 emerging-market counterparts tracked
by Bloomberg. The depreciation pushes up the price of imports
and threatens to further fuel inflation, which helped sparked
nationwide street protests last month. The central bank planned
to auction foreign-exchange swaps for a fourth day this week to
stem the real’s decline.  China’s excess capacity in areas including steel and copper
smelting must be idled by September and eliminated by year-end,
the Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  said in a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
