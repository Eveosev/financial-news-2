Otsuka Holdings Co. (4578)  failed to win
the backing of a European Medicines Agency panel for the
Delamanid medicine for tuberculosis that resists treatment with
other drugs.  The benefits of Delamanid hadn’t been sufficiently shown,
the agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use said
today in a  statement  following its monthly meeting. The duration
of treatment in the main study the Tokyo-based company presented
was two months, too short to establish the medicine’s
effectiveness, the committee said.  Tuberculosis, the world’s deadliest infectious disease
after AIDS, killed  1.4 million people  in 2011, according to the
 World Health Organization . While TB can be cured with
antibiotics, strains of the bacterium that resist most drugs
afflict about  630,000 people  worldwide, the WHO said. Delamanid
was intended to be given to patients whose disease no longer
responded to isoniazid and rifampicin, two standard therapies,
according to the EMA.  Delamanid works by blocking the production of mycolic acid,
a key component of the dense, waxy shell that encases the
tuberculosis bug and helps it resist penicillin and most
antibiotics. A study published in the  New England Journal of
Medicine  last year showed the drug helped fight tuberculosis
strains not stopped by other medications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
