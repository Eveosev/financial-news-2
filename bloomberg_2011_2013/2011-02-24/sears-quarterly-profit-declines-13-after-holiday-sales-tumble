  Sears Holdings Corp ., the largest
U.S. department-store chain, said fourth-quarter profit fell
13 percent after same-store sales declined during the holidays.  Net income dropped to $374 million, or $3.43 a share, in
the quarter ended Jan. 29, from $430 million, or $3.74, a year
earlier, the  Hoffman Estates , Illinois-based company said today
in a PR Newswire statement. Adjusted earnings per share were
$3.60, compared with a company forecast of $3.39 to $4.12.  Sears opened its namesake stores on Thanksgiving Day for
the first time as it competed against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
J.C. Penney Co. to lure holiday shoppers. Sales at domestic
Sears stores open at least 12 months declined 4.5 percent in the
quarter while those at its Kmart unit rose 2.5 percent.  Lou D’Ambrosio assumed duties today as chief executive
officer and president. D’Ambrosio, a former CEO of
telecommunications company Avaya Inc., had worked as a
consultant to the Sears board on strategic and operational
matters, the company said yesterday.  D’Ambrosio, who replaces interim CEO W. Bruce Johnson, sold
Avaya to  Silver Lake  and TPG Inc. for $8.2 billion in 2007 and
stepped down for medical reasons in June 2008.  Sears tumbled $2.93, or 3.3 percent, to $87.23 yesterday in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Before today, the
shares had advanced 18 percent this year.
