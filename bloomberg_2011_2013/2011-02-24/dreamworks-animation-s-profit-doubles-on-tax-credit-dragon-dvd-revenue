  DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc ., maker
of the “Shrek” movies, said fourth-quarter profit doubled on a
tax benefit and DVD sales of “How to Train Your Dragon.”  Net income increased to $85.2 million, or 99 cents a share,
from $43.6 million, or 50 cents, a year earlier, the Glendale,
California-based studio said today in a statement. Sales gained
42 percent to $275.7 million, missing the $291.7 million average
of 11 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Home-video sales partly countered weak box-office sales for
“Megamind,” one of the studio’s three 2010 releases. The film
collected as much as $90 million less than expected in U.S. and
Canadian theaters, Doug Creutz, a Cowen & Co. analyst, said in a
Feb. 22 note to investors. Animated films generally
underperformed during the year, Creutz said. “Megamind” took
in $320 million worldwide, DreamWorks Animation said.  Excluding some items, analysts expected profit of 73 cents
a share, the average of 12 estimates. The tax credit added $45
million, or 52 cents, to earnings, DreamWorks Animation said.  “Megamind,” which comes out on DVD on tomorrow, won’t
provide any meaningful contribution to the current quarter, the
said in the statement.  DreamWorks Animation shares rose 7 cents to $28.10 at 4
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares
have fallen 4.6 percent this year.  During the year, DreamWorks Animation repurchased 3.1
million of its shares for about $111 million, according to the
statement. The company has $150 million remaining under its
current authorization.  (DreamWorks Animation plans a conference call
at 4:30 p.m. New York time at +1-800-230-1059 for U.S. callers
and +1-612-234-9959 for others.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
