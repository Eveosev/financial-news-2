  Bank of America Corp . won dismissal
of claims by investors that it misled them about the liquidity
of its auction-rate securities and manipulated the market for
the investments, a federal judge in  San Francisco  ruled.  U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said in an order today
that investors could renew market-manipulation claims if they
added more information to their complaints.  Investors who bought auction rated securities from 2003 to
2008 sued Bank of America in 2009 on claims that auction rate
securities were offered as safe, cash-like investments while the
company hid the products’ risks. Banks running periodic auctions
abandoned the $330 billion market for the securities in 2008
amid the fallout from the subprime market slump and investors
were stuck with the products.  Bank of America, based in  Charlotte , North Carolina, agreed
in October 2008 to buy back $4.5 billion in auction-rate
securities from investors and pay a $50 million fine in
agreements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
then New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo.  Plaintiffs in the case pending in federal court in San
Francisco haven’t benefited from the settlement and continue to
hold the securities or sold them at a loss, according to White’s
ruling.  Dan Girard, an attorney for investors, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment.  The case is Bondar v. Bank of America, 08-02599, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).
