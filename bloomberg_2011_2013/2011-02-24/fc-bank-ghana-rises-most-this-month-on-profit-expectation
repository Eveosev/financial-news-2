  HFC Bank Ghana Ltd ., a mortgage
provider in the West African nation, rose the most this month as
investors expect an increase in the bank’s full-year profit.  The stock gained 3 pesewas, or 7.7 percent, to close at 42
pesewas by 3 p.m. in Accra, the capital. That was its biggest
climb since Jan. 28.  HFC Bank is expected to post a “moderately positive”
profit for 2010, Nii Ampa-Sowa, head of research at Accra-based
Databank Financial Services Ltd., said in a phone interview
today, declining to give a specific forecast. The bank has until
the end of next month to release its results, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
