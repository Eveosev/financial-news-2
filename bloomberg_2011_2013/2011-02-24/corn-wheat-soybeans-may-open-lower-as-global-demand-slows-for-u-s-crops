What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that rising
oil prices will slow global economic growth and demand for grain
used to make food, animal feed and fuel, said  Don Roose , the
president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as rains in China may revive winter crops after drought
threatened production the past three months and rising oil
prices slow world food demand, Roose said.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 11 cents a bushel lower
on the CBOT as rains revive production prospects in Brazil and  Argentina , the worldâ€™s biggest exporters of the oilseed after
the U.S., Roose said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
down 0.2 cent to 0.3 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open $1 to $3 lower per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
