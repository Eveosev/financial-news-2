The Serbian government said it would
sell 18,000 tons of sugar over the next six months from state
reserves in order to ease a shortage on the retail market.  The market intervention will involve 3,000 tons of sugar a
month which will be offered to retailers at a wholesale price of
82.5 dinars per kilogram. The retail price will be limited to 98
dinars a kilogram, the government said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Serbia had record sugar production of 490,000 tons last
year, according to Agriculture Minister Sasa Dragin, who also
said the shortage in  Serbia  was apparently caused by excessive
exports by producers and wholesalers due to better prices
abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
