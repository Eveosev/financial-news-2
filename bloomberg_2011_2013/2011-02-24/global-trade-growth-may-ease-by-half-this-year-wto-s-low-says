Global trade growth may decline by
as much as half this year compared with 2010 as commerce returns
to a “normal trend,” said Patrick Low, chief economist at the  World Trade Organization .  “If we have 13.5 percent for last year, this year will be
somewhat half of that growth” because trade expanded at such a
fast past in 2010 after the slowdown of 2009, Low said in an
interview today in  Hong Kong . “You may call it a slowdown, but
I would say it’s a return to the normal trend.”  The WTO predicted in September that global trade would
expand 13.5 percent in 2010, fueled by growth in Asia led by
China and India, after falling the most since World War II in
2009 amid the financial crisis.  Global trade growth showed some signs of moderation in the
fourth quarter, Low said. Higher  oil prices  and food costs pose
risks to trade because they “tend to slow growth,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
