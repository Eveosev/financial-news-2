Trade sanctions against  Libya  should
be avoided because they may weaken the wrong people and take too
long to have an effect, Anton Boerner, head of the Berlin-based
BGA foreign trade lobby, told  Handelsblatt .  Freezing accounts, limiting immigration of Libyan nationals
and issuing international search warrants may be more effective
ways to end the violence in Libya, Boerner told the Dusseldorf-
based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
