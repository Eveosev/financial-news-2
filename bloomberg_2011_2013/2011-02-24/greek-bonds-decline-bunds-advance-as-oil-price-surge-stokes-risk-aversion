Greece and Ireland led declines in
the bonds of the euro region’s most-indebted nations as
escalating violence in  Libya  pushed the price of oil to a 30-
month high, sapping demand for assets perceived to be risky.  German 10-year bund yields reached the lowest in almost a
month as tensions rose in  Africa ’s third-largest crude producer.
European stocks fell for the fifth consecutive day. Italy sold
1.5 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of inflation-linked securities
today and plans to sell up to 9.5 billion euros of notes and
bonds tomorrow. An index of European economic confidence in
February rose to the highest in more than three years.  “The tensions going on in the Middle East and in northern
Africa are definitely driving the safe-haven assets,” said
Norbert Aul, an interest-rates strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in  London . “Massive supply, including Italy tomorrow, is
also a supportive factor for the bund and suppressing the
peripherals.”  Greek 10-year yields climbed 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 11.86 percent at 4:24 p.m. in London, after
reaching 11.89 percent, the highest level since Jan. 11. The
Irish 10-year yield surged 17 basis points to 9.32 percent.
Portuguese 10-year yields added four basis points to 7.50
percent, while Italian 10-year yields gained one basis point to
4.84 percent.  The yield on the 10-year bund, the euro region’s benchmark
government security, declined one basis point to 3.13 percent
after earlier reaching 3.11 percent, the lowest level since
Jan. 25. Two-year German note yields fell two basis points to
1.53 percent.  Italian Sale  Italy sold 1.5 billion euros of 2.1 percent index-linked
notes maturing in September 2021. It received bids for 1.65
times the securities sold, compared with 2.14 at the sale on
Oct. 27. The average yield was 2.81 percent, compared with 2.18
percent at the October sale.  “The auction went well,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior
fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in Milan. “It reflects
good demand for inflation-linked products. Overall demand should
be good” at tomorrow’s auctions, he said.  The nation plans to sell up to 1.5 billion euros of
floating-rate notes due in 2017 and as much as 3 billion euros
of 2013 bonds and 5 billion euros of debt maturing in 2021
tomorrow.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index dropped 0.7 percent. Brent oil
for April settlement rose as much as $8.54, or 7.7 percent, to
$119.79 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, the highest
level since Aug. 21, 2008.  ‘Safe-Haven’ Limits  “The Middle East situation is a real complication,” said  Sean Maloney , a fixed-income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.
in London. “It wouldn’t take much to shift us the other way. If
the data continues like it has been there’s a limit to how far
the safe-haven flows can go.”  The yield on the German two-year note rose above that of
similar-maturity U.K. securities yesterday for the first time
since Feb. 1. The so-called spread was eight basis points today.  Three-month Euribor futures rose for the first time in five
days, with the implied yield on the contract expiring in
December falling three basis points to 1.95 percent, as traders
pared bets that the  European Central Bank  will boost borrowing
costs. The implied yield has risen from 1.33 percent at the end
of 2010.  Policy makers will make the decisions necessary to maintain  price stability , ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told
reporters yesterday in  Frankfurt . The central bank will hold a
policy meeting on March 3.  European Confidence  A gauge of economic confidence in the 17-nation euro area
increased to 107.8 in February, the most since September 2007,
from a revised 106.8 a month earlier, according to a report from
the European Commission today. The median estimate of 28
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a gain to 106.8
from a previously reported 106.5.  German exports advanced 2.5 percent in the final three
months of last year, a report showed today, beating economists’
forecasts for a 1.1 percent rise.    Germany ’s consumer price index increased 0.5 percent in
February after falling 0.4 percent in January, according to the
median forecast of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before tomorrow’s report.  Euro-region inflation breached the ECB’s 2 percent ceiling
for a second month in January, accelerating to 2.4 percent, the
fastest since October 2008.  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.2
percent this year, compared with a 3.1 percent return for Greek
debt, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S.
Treasuries have lost 0.4 percent and U.K. gilts 1.5 percent over
the same period, the indexes show.  The losses contrast with gains made in 2010 as the euro-
region’s sovereign-debt crisis fueled investor demand for the
safest fixed-income assets. German bunds returned 6.3 percent in
2010, the indexes show. Treasuries gained 6 percent, while U.K.
gilts returned investors 7.6 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
