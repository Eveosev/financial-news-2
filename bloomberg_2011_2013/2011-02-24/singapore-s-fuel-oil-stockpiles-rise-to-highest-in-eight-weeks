Singapore’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest in eight weeks, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, rose 19 percent
to 20.2 million in the seven days to Feb. 23,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies are at the highest since the week ended Dec. 29.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 1.8 percent to 13.4 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline decreased
5.3 percent to 10.2 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
