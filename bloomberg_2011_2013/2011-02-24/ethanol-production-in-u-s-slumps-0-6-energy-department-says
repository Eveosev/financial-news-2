U.S. ethanol production fell 0.6
percent to 888,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Output dropped a fourth week, the longest streak of
declines since the department began releasing weekly data in
June, to the lowest level since Jan. 7. Stockpiles slipped 1.2
percent to 19.3 million barrels, the department reported in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
increased 6.4 percent to 4.96 million barrels a day, the highest
since Dec. 24. Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every
gallon of ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.451 a gallon yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have climbed 43 percent in the past year.  An average ethanol mills in Iowa is losing 7 cents on every
gallon produced on a spot basis and a plant in  Illinois  is
losing 1 cent, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
