  Capita Group Plc , which provides a
criminal records service for the U.K. Home Office, rose the most
in almost five years after saying it is bidding for and winning
more orders than in 2010 as the economy recovers from recession.  Capita won contracts worth 244 million pounds ($394
million) in the first seven weeks of 2011, equivalent to 31
percent of the value of the orders it received in the whole of
2010, the London-based company said in a statement today.  “This year has a much better feel about it,” Chief
Executive Officer Paul Pindar said in a telephone interview.
“The previous government were not great advocates of
outsourcing. We would expect to see a slight reversal of that.”  Capita suffered what Pindar called “headwinds” last year
as the U.K. Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition
government put contract decisions on hold as it grappled with
plans to reduce the record public sector spending deficit.  The coalition is more open to arguments that external
providers like Capita can provide some of the savings it is
looking for, Pindar said. Government contracts accounted for 10
percent of its business last year, half the level in 1997 when
the  Labour Party  came to power, he said.  “Today’s results should steady the share price,” Investec
Plc analyst Robert Morton, who rates the shares “hold,” said
in a note to clients. “As tangible evidence comes through that
business is picking up, we would expect the shares to firm up.”  The shares surged 48 pence, or 7.2 percent, to 718 pence at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the biggest one-day rise since
July, 20 2006, and the highest closing price in five weeks.  Net income rose 24 percent to 235 million pounds, or 38
pence a share, from 188.9 million pounds, or 30.8 pence, in
2009, Capita said in the statement. Revenue rose 2 percent to
2.74 billion pounds.  Capita raised its final dividend 20 percent to 13.4 pence a
share, making a total of 20 pence for the year.  The company is to open a multi-lingual business center in
Krakow in  Poland  next year to service life insurance companies
and pensions providers in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
