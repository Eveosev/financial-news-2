Gabon ’s Societe Sucriere d’Afrique
plans to boost production 5.9 percent this year and double the
amount of sugar it exports, said Faustin Okouele, the company’s
production manager.  Output will rise to 30,000 metric tons of the sweetener,
and shipments of 7,000 tons will go to central African neighbors
Cameroon,  Equatorial Guinea  and Sao Tome and Principe, Okouele
said in a phone interview yesterday.  Demand for sugar in Gabon, sub-Saharan Africa’s fifth-
biggest oil producer, is climbing 1.5 percent annually, he said.
The company, based 690 kilometers (429 miles) from the capital,
Libreville, in the southeastern town of Ouele, sold 10,000 tons
of sugar to brewers in Gabon in 2010.  The company, known as Sucaf, runs sugar-cane plantations of
9,928 hectares to fuel its production facilities, Okouele said.  South Africa  is the continent’s top sugar producer, with 2010-11
output expected to be 2.1 million tons, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture .  White, or refined, sugar for May delivery fell $1.60, or
0.2 percent, to $701 a ton by 3:21 p.m. on the Liffe exchange in  London  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
