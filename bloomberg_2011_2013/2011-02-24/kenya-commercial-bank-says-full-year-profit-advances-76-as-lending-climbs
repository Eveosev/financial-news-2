  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd ., the East
African nation’s fifth-biggest bank, said full-year profit
climbed 76 percent as lending grew.  Net income increased to 7.18 billion shillings ($88
million), or 2.76 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December from 4.08 billion shillings, or 1.84 shillings a share,
a year earlier, Chairman Peter Muthoka told reporters in Nairobi
today. Net interest income, the money banks earn from interest
on loans, jumped 36 percent to 19.6 billion shillings.  “It surpassed expectations,” Johnson Nderi, a researcher
with Nairobi-based  Suntra Investment Bank Ltd. , said in an
interview today. “We expect the share to hit 25 shillings
within the week.” The stock rose the most in a week, adding 1.1
percent to close at 23.25 by 3 p.m. in Nairobi.  Kenyan banks are reaping benefits of accelerated economic
growth in the country, with expansion expected to reach 5.7
percent this year, the fastest pace in four years, compared with
5.2 percent last year, according to government estimates.    Barclays Bank  of  Kenya  Ltd., the country’s second-biggest
lender, said on Feb. 22 that full-year profit jumped 74 percent
to 10.6 billion shillings, while  NIC Bank Ltd ., a Kenyan lender,
reported a 71 percent increase in net income today.  The industry’s combined pre-tax profit surged 46 percent to
66 billion shillings in the 11 months through November on loan
growth and higher income from fees and commissions, the Nairobi-
based  Central Bank of Kenya  said on Feb. 11.  Kenya Commercial raised 12.5 billion shillings in a sale of
stock to existing shareholders that ended July 23 for expansion
at its operations predominately in Kenya, as well as  Uganda ,  Tanzania , Rwanda and southern  Sudan . Demand fell short of supply
as shareholders applied to buy 83 percent of the stock on offer.  Customers have doubled over the last year to 1.5 million,
while the number of branch outlets stands at 218 across the
region, Martin Oduor-Otieno, managing director of Kenya
Commercial, said at the same event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
