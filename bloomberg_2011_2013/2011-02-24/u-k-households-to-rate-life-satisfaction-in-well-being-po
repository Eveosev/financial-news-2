U.K. households are to be asked to
rate their “life satisfaction” as the country’s statistics
office seeks to add a measure of well-being to its traditional
economic indicators.  About 200,000 people will be asked from April to rank how
satisfied they are with their lives on a scale of zero to ten,
the  Office for National Statistics  in London said in a statement
today. Respondents to the survey will also be asked a series of
questions including how happy and anxious they feel.  “While we want to produce consistent results over time, we
will initially regard the results of experimental,” Paul Allin,
a program director at the statistics office, said in the
statement.  The aim is to provide a fuller insight into society than
that provided by traditional economic measures such as gross
domestic product. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  commissioned
similar research as officials try to find other gauges for the
strength of an economy.  The U.K. questions include, “Overall, how satisfied are
you with your life nowadays?” and “How happy did you feel
yesterday?” as well as “How anxious did you feel yesterday?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
