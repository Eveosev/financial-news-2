Jordan will solicit bids next month
from  GDF Suez  SA, Rosatom Corp., Datang International Power
Generation Co. and Kansai Electric Power Co. to operate and
invest in the Arab kingdom’s first nuclear reactor.  Officials are reviewing the requests for proposals to put
them in “final form” before asking for bids in the second week
of March, the  Jordan Atomic Energy Commission  said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Energy Minister Khalid Touqan said on Feb. 17 that the
requests were due to be sent to the companies this week.  Jordan, which relies almost entirely on imports for its
energy needs, is turning to nuclear power to meet increasing
electricity demand. The country plans to build at least one
reactor by 2019 and has signed nuclear cooperation agreements
with 12 countries, most recently  Turkey , with which Jordan
completed an accord on Feb. 17.  Jordan’s atomic commission has preselected possible
technologies from Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.,  Russia ’s ZAO
Atomstroyexport and Paris-based Atmea, a venture between  France ’s Areva SA and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd . of Japan.
The Jordanians will select a preferred technology supplier for
the reactor by the end of August and make a final selection by
the end of 2011, Touqan said on Feb. 17.  Jordan also plans to announce in March the results of a
request for proposal for a financial adviser to help the
government on the nuclear project, the minister said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
