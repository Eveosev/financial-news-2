  Regions Financial Corp .,  Alabama ’s
largest lender, said it posted $195 million in additional
collateral for derivatives contracts after its credit ratings
were cut in the fourth quarter.  Regions agreed to post the collateral with broker-dealer
counterparties following the moves by Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services and Moody’s Investors Service, the Birmingham-based
bank said in a regulatory filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
