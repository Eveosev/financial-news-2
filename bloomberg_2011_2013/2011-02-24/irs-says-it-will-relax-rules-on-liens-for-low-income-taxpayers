The U.S.  Internal Revenue Service 
said it will relax some enforcement methods that an agency
ombudsman said have been burdensome to low-income taxpayers.  Commissioner Doug Shulman said in a statement today that
the agency would make it easier for taxpayers to seek withdrawal
of liens when they pay a tax debt or make arrangements to pay in
installments for debts of less than $25,000.  The agency also raised the dollar thresholds before liens
are typically filed.  “We are making fundamental changes to our lien system and
other collection tools that will help taxpayers and give them a
fresh start,” Shulman said in the statement. “These steps are
good for people facing tough times, and they reflect a
responsible approach for the tax system.”  Nina Olson, the national taxpayer advocate employed by the
agency, has criticized the IRS’s lien policies in her past two
annual reports to Congress, calling them ineffective and harmful
to taxpayers trying to rebuild their financial lives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
