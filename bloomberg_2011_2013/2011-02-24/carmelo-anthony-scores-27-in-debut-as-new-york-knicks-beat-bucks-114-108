  Carmelo Anthony  scored 27 points and
Chauncey Billups added 21 in their New York debuts as the Knicks
beat the Milwaukee Bucks 114-108.  Anthony went 10-for-25 from the field and grabbed 10
rebounds, while Billups went 12-for-12 from the free throw line
as New York raised its record to 29-26. Amar’e Stoudemire added
19 points before fouling out and Toney Douglas scored 23 off the
bench for New York.  “I’m never going to forget this moment,” Anthony said in
a televised interview. “I’m home.”  The game was the Knicks’ first since yesterday’s 13-player,
three-team trade involving the Denver Nuggets and Minnesota
Timberwolves.  With the sold out Madison Square Garden fans giving the
Knicks’ new starting lineup -- Anthony, Stoudemire, Billups,
Landry Fields and Ronny Turiaf -- a standing ovation, the pre-
game introduction of Anthony was almost completely drowned out
by the crowd’s roar.  Dozens of blue and orange No. 7 Anthony jerseys and t-
shirts were visible in the stands, and the crowd erupted again
when Anthony scored his first two points off an offensive
rebound 2 1/2 minutes into the game. Billups followed with a 3-
pointer on  New York ’s next offensive possession.  The Knicks led for most of the game, though they were
unable to make sure of the win until the closing moments.  New York raced out to a 20-10 advantage halfway through the
first quarter and led 33-24 at the end of the frame.  The Bucks responded in the second, tying the contest at 53
apiece before New York ended the half with a 59-57 lead.  Milwaukee (22-35) moved ahead on a Carlos Delfino 3-pointer
to open the third quarter, though New York led for much of the
period as Billups scored seven points, giving the Knicks an 86-
79 lead entering the final quarter.  The Bucks remained in reach until Anthony’s fall-away 12-
footer with 26.8 seconds remaining gave the Knicks a six-point
cushion that forced  Milwaukee  to begin fouling.  John Salmons led the Bucks with 27 points and seven
assists, while center Andrew Bogut added 14 points and 12
rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
