Gujarat Fluorochemicals Ltd., an
Indian maker of refrigerant gases, rose after winning United
Nations carbon credits for the second time this year following
an 11-month dry spell amid a probe of emission-reduction
projects.  The shares gained as much as 6.9 percent to 274 rupees and
traded at 263.7 rupees, up 2.9 percent, as of 10:34 a.m. local
time. The benchmark Sensitive Index fell 1 percent.  Gujarat Fluorochemicals gets the credits because it
prevents its plant in Ranjitnagar in Gujarat state from venting
hydrofluorocarbon-23, or HFC-23, a by-product of refrigerant
production and potent greenhouse gas, into the air.  The shares rose to a three-year high on Jan. 18 after the
UN Clean Development Mechanism, the world’s second-biggest
greenhouse gas market, issued 2.4 million credits to the
company. Prior to that,  Gujarat Flourochemicals  hadn’t received
credits since Feb. 16, 2010, amid a UN review of HFC projects
after the environmental group CDM Watch said some companies may
be increasing HCFC-22 output simply to generate credits.  The price of one UN credit, known as a Certified Emission
Reduction, for delivery in December 2011 closed at 11.76 euros
($16.20) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange in  London  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
