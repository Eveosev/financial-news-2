(Corrects to show comparisons are on quarter in second
paragraph.)    New World Resources NV , the largest
Czech producer of coal for steelmakers, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 22 percent as commodity prices and sales advanced.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, climbed to 162 million euros ($222  
million) from 133 million euros in the previous quarter, the
Amsterdam-based company said today in a statement.  Revenue in the three months ended Dec. 31 rose 14 percent
from the previous quarter to 466 million euros.  NWR produces coking, or steelmaking, coal and thermal coal
and owns four mines and two coking facilities in the Czech
Republic. Its customers include the Czech unit of  ArcelorMittal , the worldâ€™s largest steelmaker.  The company also plans a mine in Debiensko, southern  Poland . NWR expects the project to cost as much as 400 million
euros and produce about 3 million tons of coking coal and
steam coal a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
