The  United Nations Special Tribunal
for Lebanon  investigating the 2005 killing of former Prime
Minister  Rafiq Hariri  will issue indictments for the
assassination in March and May,  Al-Liwaa  reported.  The first indictment will be issued by mid-March and
includes names of members of the Shiite Hezbollah movement who
are “not senior or well known,” the Beirut-based newspaper
reported, citing an unnamed person at the UN. The second will
include names of people involved in assassination and “is
expected to cause a big and dangerous jolt,” Al-Liwaa said.  Controversy over the UN inquiry into the Hariri killing led
to the collapse of Prime Minister Saad Hariri’s government last
month after the Hezbollah movement and its allies walked out.
Hezbollah says the U.S. and  Israel  instigated the  tribunal  to
target the group, along with  Syria , which supports Hezbollah.  The indictment filed last month by the UN prosecutor is
being reviewed by the pretrial judge of the court in the
Netherlands. Hezbollah’s leader,  Hassan Nasrallah , has said  he
expects the judge to indict some of his members. Hezbollah has
denied any involvement in Hariri’s death, as has Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
