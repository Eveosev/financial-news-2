Wheat fell for a second day in South
Africa on speculation wet weather will benefit the crop in  China .  China’s drought-affected areas are forecast to get 5
millimeters (0.2 inch) to 15 millimeters of rain or snow
beginning tomorrow through Feb. 28, with some regions in three
provinces including Henan getting as much as 55 millimeters, the
National Meteorological Center said on its website today.  “There has been talk of rain in China in dry areas,” Piet
Faure, a trader at CJS Securities Ltd., said by phone from
Johannesburg today.  Wheat for March delivery, the most-active contract on the
 South African Futures Exchange , declined 43 rand, or 1.4
percent, to close at 3,138 rand ($443) a metric ton in
Johannesburg.  White corn for July delivery declined 19 rand, or 1.2
percent, to 1,555 rand a ton. Meal made from the grain is  South
Africa ’s staple food. The U.S., China and  Argentina  are the
world’s biggest corn exporters.  Yellow corn for July delivery dropped 7.40 rand, or 0.5
percent, to 1,602.60 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly for  animal feed  in South Africa.  The gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
following crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
