U.S. stock futures maintained losses
after government data showed jobless claims fell more than
forecast to below 400,000, while durable goods orders trailed
estimates.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in March
dropped 0.5 percent to 1,299 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York . The
benchmark gauge for U.S. equities has slumped 2.7 percent over
the last two days. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
retreated 40 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,054 today.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 22,000 to
391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would drop to 405,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Claims have fallen in three of the past four weeks, pushing down
the monthly average to the lowest level since July 2008.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years rose
2.7 percent after a 0.4 percent drop in December that was
smaller than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed. Orders excluding transportation
equipment unexpectedly dropped, reflecting a recurring pattern
of declines in capital goods in the first month of a quarter.  U.S. stocks fell yesterday, dragging benchmark indexes to
the biggest two-day drop in six months, as oil surged to $100 a
barrel amid growing tensions in the Middle East and Hewlett-
Packard Co.’s forecasts trailed analysts’ estimates. The  S&P 500 
has rallied 4 percent in 2011 as reports showed an improving
economy and earnings beat analysts’ estimates for the eighth
straight quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
