Japanese stocks fell for a third day,
sending the  Nikkei 225  Stock Average to its longest losing
streak November, as oil surged to near a 30-month high amid
escalating conflict in Libya.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, sank 1.7
percent.  Sony Corp ., the country’s largest exporter of
electronics, dropped 1.5 percent. Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s No.
1 shipping line, decreased 2.5 percent. Tobu Railway Co., a
train and bus operator, plunged 12 percent after announcing it
plans a share sale.  “Share prices will have a tough time rebounding as long as
investors have their eyes on the risks stemming from the
uncertainty in the Middle East,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general
manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $75 billion.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.2 percent to 10,452.71
as of the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, extending the longest streak of
declines since a three-day slide that ended Nov. 1. The broader
Topix index lost 1.3 percent to 934.22, with more than nine
times as many shares falling as advancing.  The Topix had risen 8.4 percent this year through Feb. 21 as
companies reported improved earnings. That pushed the index to
the highest level since April and boosted the average price of
stocks in the measure to 16.5 times estimated earnings.  Intensifying Conflict  The intensifying conflict in  Libya  sent global indexes from
New York to Tokyo down this week, halting a rally in stocks that
last week drove the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its highest
level in 32 months. The  S&P 500  declined 0.6 percent yesterday
in  New York , falling for a second day.  Carmakers contributed the most to the Topix’s decline as
the yen’s appreciation cut the value of exporters’ earnings.
Toyota sank 1.7 percent to 3,675 yen. Honda Motor Co., Japan’s
third-biggest carmaker by sales, lost 1.4 percent to 3,475 yen.
Mazda Motor Corp., the nation’s second-largest car exporter,
dropped 1.4 percent to 210 yen.  The yen rose to as high as 81.98 against the dollar today
in Tokyo, compared with 82.64 at the close of  stock trading 
yesterday. The currency’s appreciated as the dollar fell against
most of its major counterparts on speculation central banks will
raise  interest rates  to combat inflation from rising fuel costs.  Uprising in Libya  Makers of electronics also fell. Sony, the maker of Bravia
televisions and PlayStation game consoles, declined 1.5 percent
to 2,932 yen. Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets more than 80
percent of its sales overseas, fell 1 percent to 3,905 yen.  The uprising in Libya may have caused  Africa ’s third-
biggest oil supplier to lose as much as two-thirds of its output
and the unrest threatens to spread. Libya is the latest country
to be roiled by protesters emboldened by the ouster of Tunisia’s
president last month and the fall of Egyptian President  Hosni
Mubarak  on Feb 11. Demonstrations have erupted in  Iran , Bahrain,
Yemen and Algeria.  “No one knows how or when things are going be resolved and
investors are looking to limit risk exposure,” said Masanori Ikunaga, head of domestic stocks at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset
Management Co. “With emerging economies showing signs of
overheating and a policy focus on inflation, higher  oil prices 
will have a big impact on monetary policy.”  Brent Crude  Brent crude for April settlement rose as high as $113 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange during
Tokyo trading hours, the highest since September 2008. Prices
may surge to $220 a barrel if more production is halted in Libya
and  Algeria , Nomura Holdings Inc. said yesterday in a note.  Shipping lines fell after the Baltic Dry Index, a gauge of
cargo rates, declined yesterday for a third day to the lowest
level since Feb. 15. Nippon Yusen slid 2.5 percent to 359 yen,
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., Japan’s third-largest shipping
company, slid 2.5 percent to 347 yen.  Tobu Railway dropped the most on the Nikkei after the train
operator said it plans to raise as much as 93.2 billion yen
($1.1 billion) by selling shares to the public. The stock
plunged 12 percent to close at 400 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
