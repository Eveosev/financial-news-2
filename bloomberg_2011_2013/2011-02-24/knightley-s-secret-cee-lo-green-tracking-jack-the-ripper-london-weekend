Rockers get the best of both
worlds at Wembley Arena on Friday, from abrasive metal to
smooth soul.  The NME Awards 2011 Big Gig stage hosts Cee Lo Green,
whose silky voice has graced hits such as “Forget You.” The
show is headlined by the Foo Fighters, led by Dave Grohl, who
is this year’s winner of the NME’s “Godlike Genius” Award.
Support acts include Band of Horses and No Age.  Wembley Arena, Arena Square, Engineers Way, HA9 OAA.

her paints in a canvas-and-leather satchel.  The faded shoulder bag is displayed in  Tate Britain ’s
“Watercolour,” a survey of the medium’s evolving role -- as
an aristocratic pastime, a precursor of photography and a
chronicler of the horrors of war.  The standout work is Turner’s “The Blue Rigi” (1842),
rescued from export by a 2007 national fundraising campaign.
It’s a tough act to follow, as the works of later artists in
the exhibition abundantly demonstrate.  “Watercolour” is at Tate Britain through Aug. 21.

contemporary Italian cuisine. The lunchtime prix-fixe menu is
19.50 pounds for three courses and 15 pounds for two.

the Tate’s Rex Whistler restaurant, known for its wine list
and its murals. Information:  http://bit.ly/9qL3Y  or +44-20-

1930s schoolteacher accused of having a lesbian affair with a
colleague in “The Children’s Hour.” Knightley gives a
credible performance, facing down critics who sometimes sniff
at her acting.  Other names in the cast: Elisabeth Moss (from “Mad
Men”) as her presumed lover, and Ellen Burstyn as the
accusing student’s high-born grandmother. Lillian Hellman
wrote the play.  “The Children’s Hour” is at the Comedy Theatre through
May 7. Information:  http://www.ambassadortickets.com  or +44-
844-871-7627.  Spice Market, the pan-Asian restaurant of New York chef
Jean-Georges Vongerichten, has opened nearby at the new W
hotel, on Leicester Square. Meals, served all day, include
rice-cracker-crusted tuna with citrus-chili sauce.

your weekend.  Jack the Ripper butchered at least five prostitutes in
1888, and was never convincingly identified. A dedicated tour
sets out from the  Tower of London , winds its way through East
End alleys, and culminates in an old Victorian pub where
Ripper’s victims downed their pints. The newspaper headlines
and period photos on the walls keep it real.  Information:  http://www.jacktheripperwalk.com .  (Farah Nayeri writes for Muse, the arts and leisure
