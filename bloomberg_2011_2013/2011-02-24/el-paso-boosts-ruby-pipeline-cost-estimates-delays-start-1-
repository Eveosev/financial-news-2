  El Paso Corp ., owner of the largest
network of interstate natural-gas pipelines in  North America ,
increased its cost estimate for the  Ruby pipeline  project by 18
percent to $3.55 billion and delayed its opening another month.  The updated cost and July in-service estimate comes from
“greater clarity” around weather impacts, pending regulatory
approvals and site restrictions for wildlife protection,
Houston-based El Paso said in a statement today. To protect the
sage grouse during its mating season, construction in western
Nevada will halt from March 1 to May 15, the company said.  El Paso said in November the project would be as much as 15
percent more than its $3 billion budget and would open in June,
after previously saying it would begin operating in March. The
company repeated the June in-service date two weeks ago in a 
presentation .  The 680-mile (1,000-kilometer) pipeline will move gas from
production areas in the  Rocky Mountains  to markets on the West
Coast. It will connect a gas trading hub in Opal, Wyoming to a
pipeline near Malin,  Oregon .  To contact the reporter on this story:
