The  Netherlands  Competition
Authority and U.K. energy regulator Ofgem approved the
auctioning of capacity on the  Britned  power cable between the
countries, scheduled to begin commercial operations in April.  The 1,000-megawatt link built by network managers  National
Grid Plc  and Tennet Holding BV fits with the European Union’s
plan to create a single European power market by 2014. Trials on
flows between the U.K. and Netherlands began on Feb. 1.  “The link marks a significant step toward creating a
single European energy market and the approval of the access
rules has cleared the way for putting the cable into
operation,” Ofgem and The Netherlands Competition Authority
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Test flows from the U.K. to the Netherlands will reach as
much as 515 megawatts tomorrow, National Grid said today in a
separate statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
