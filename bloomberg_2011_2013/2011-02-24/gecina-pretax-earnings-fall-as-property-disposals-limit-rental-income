  Gecina SA , France’s second-largest
publicly traded property company, said pretax earnings excluding
changes in asset values and other items fell 5.9 percent last
year following the sale of buildings.  The profit measure, known as recurrent income, declined to
327.4 million euros ($450 million), or 5.38 euros a share, from
348.1 million euros, or 5.77 euros, a year earlier, the Paris-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts expected 5.47
euros a share, according to the median of six estimates in a
Bloomberg survey.  In November, Gecina forecast a full-year recurrent income
decline of as much as 6 percent as Chief Executive Officer
Christophe Clamageran sells assets to focus on offices,
apartment buildings and health-care related buildings in  France .
Rising borrowing costs will probably cause recurrent income to
fall 7 percent in 2011, the company predicted.  The results are “a mixed bag,” said Henri Quadrelli, an
analyst at  Societe Generale  with a “hold” recommendation on
Gecina shares. Recurrent income was lower than he expected,
while net asset value exceeded his estimates.  Gecina declined 1.3 euros, or 1.3 percent, to 89.10 euros
at 10:26 a.m. in Paris trading. That trimmed the value of the
company to 5.58 billion euros.  Selling, Buying  Gecina sold 482 million euros of property last year,
reducing net rental income by 5 percent to 556 million euros.
The proceeds helped finance 781 million euros of acquisitions
including the 250 million-euro purchase of the Portes d’Arcueil
building in Paris occupied by France Telecom SA.  Clamageran, who joined in November 2009, aims to increase
Paris region office projects and developments by 80 percent to 9
billion euros by 2014. He targeted 1 billion euros of disposals,
so far achieving about one fifth of his objective.  Gecina plans to step up its sale of Paris apartments and
expects to raise 300 million euros annually from the disposals
starting next year.  Net debt rose 7.4 percent to 5.17 billion euros. Borrowings
represented 44.3 percent of the value of Gecina’s properties
compared with 45.7 percent six months earlier as values
increased. Gecina said it plans to limit that measure in the
future to 45 percent of the value of its real estate.  Net asset value rose to 99.7 euros a share from 86.8 euros
at the end of June. Gecina’s real estate appreciated by 763.2
million euros last year, boosting net income to 998.2 million
euros. The company reported a net loss of 773.7 million euros in
2009 as property values fell.  Gecina left its dividend unchanged at 4.4 euros a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
