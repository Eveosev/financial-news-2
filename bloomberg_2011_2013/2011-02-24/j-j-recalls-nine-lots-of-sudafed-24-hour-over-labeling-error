  Johnson & Johnson , the world’s
largest maker of consumer health products, said it is recalling
nine lots of extended-release Sudafed tablets in the U.S.
because of a typographical error in the directions on the label.  The cold medicine’s label includes an extra “not” when
directing patients “do not not divide, crush, chew, or dissolve
the tablet,” J&J said in a  notice  today on its website. The  New
Brunswick , New Jersey-based company said the recall affects
667,632 products and hasn’t been linked to any injuries.  Recalls cost J&J $900 million in sales last year, including
dozens of over-the-counter medicines found to be contaminated or
incorrectly labeled. So far this month, the company and its
subsidiaries have withdrawn defective Simponi injectable pens
for arthritis, vials of discolored Dermabond skin adhesive and
possibly cracked syringes of Invega Sustenna for schizophrenia.  Today’s recall affects Sudafed 24-Hour sold in packages of
10 tablets at the wholesale level, J&J said. Consumers aren’t
required to take any action and can use the medicine by
following the correct directions on the blister packaging, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
