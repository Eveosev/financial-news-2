  Manulife Financial Corp ., Canada’s
largest insurer, is looking to expand into India and South
Korea, said Robert Cook, senior executive vice president and
general manager of Asia.  “There are two obvious gaps in our portfolio, India and
Korea,” Cook said today in a telephone interview from  Hong
Kong . “We are certainly interested in the opportunities of both
countries, and we have research projects under way in both
countries. There are interesting prospects in both areas.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
