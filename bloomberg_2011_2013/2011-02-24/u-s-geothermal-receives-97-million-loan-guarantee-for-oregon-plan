U.S. Geothermal Inc., a Boise,
Idaho-based energy developer, received a $96.8 million loan
guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department to build a power plant
in eastern  Oregon .  The company said its planned 23-megawatt project at Neal
Hot Springs is the first to complete a loan guarantee from the
agency, according to a statement released today. The funding
will cover about 75 percent of total construction costs, the
company said. The remaining capital will come from an equity
investment of as much as $23.8 million announced in September
from  Enbridge Inc ., Canadaâ€™s largest pipeline company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
