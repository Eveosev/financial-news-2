  Grifols SA ,  Europe ’s largest maker
of blood-plasma products, said profit fell 22 percent in 2010 as
supply costs rose and the company spent money on the acquisition
of Talecris Biotherapeutics Holding Corp.  Net income dropped to 115.5 million euros ($159.1 million)
from 148 million euros a year earlier, the Barcelona, Spain-
based company said today in a  statement . Profit missed the 127.5
million-euro average of 13 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.5 percent to 990.7 million euros.  Grifols agreed earlier in February to extend a U.S.
antitrust-clearance deadline for its $3.6 billion purchase of
Talecris to March 6 from a previous target date of today. It
also pledged to give the U.S. Federal Trade Commission at least
30 days’ notice of the transaction’s closing, which it said
wouldn’t be before March 21. Grifols said today that it’s
“meeting all necessary conditions” to complete the takeover.  “We are very cautious with the stock,” Luis de Blas, an
analyst at Banesto Bolsa based in  Madrid , wrote in a note to
investors today. “The results weren’t good, and the shares’
current price already reflects a significant probability that
the Talecris acquisition will succeed.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 4 percent to 255.5 million euros, propelled by
a 10 percent drop in the fourth quarter.  Grifols fell 0.3 percent to 11.59 euros as of the 5:30 p.m.
close of Madrid trading. The stock has gained 14 percent this
year, valuing the company at 2.47 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
