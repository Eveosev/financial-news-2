Ghana’s parliament rejected
proposals to set aside some oil revenue for the development of
communities nearest the West African nation’s offshore Jubilee
field, the  Ghana  News Agency said.  Edward Doe Adjaho, first deputy speaker of parliament,
rejected an amendment to a proposed oil revenue law on technical
grounds, saying it should have been proposed by a minister of
state or on behalf of the president, the government agency said,
citing the parliamentary debate.  Darko-Mensah Kwabena-Okyere, an opposition member of
parliament from the country’s Western Region, vowed to appeal
the ruling to the country’s  Supreme Court , GNA reported.  The amendment would have designated 10 percent of
government oil revenues for the country’s Western Region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
