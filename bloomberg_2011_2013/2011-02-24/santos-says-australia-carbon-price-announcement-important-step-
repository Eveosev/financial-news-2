  Santos Ltd ., Australia’s third-
largest oil and gas producer, said Prime MinisterJulia Gillard’s announcement today that the government intends to
impose a price on  carbon emissions  starting next July is “an
important step.”  “Santos supports the introduction of a well-designed
carbon price, that recognizes the need to maintain Australia’s
international competitiveness,” Matthew Doman, an Adelaide-
based spokesman for Santos, said in e-mailed comments.  “Santos supports a level playing field for all energy
options and streamlining of climate-change policies.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
