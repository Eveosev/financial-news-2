Oil options volatility climbed to
the highest level in eight months as the underlying futures fell
for the first time this week on assurances from the U.S.,  Saudi
Arabia  and the  International Energy Agency  that they can
compensate for any disruption in Libyan supplies.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 40.6 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York , up
from 40.4 percent yesterday and 27.9 percent Feb. 18.  “The volatility has exploded over the past few days,”
said Ray Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New
York. “We have seen since Tuesday morning a lot of calls being
purchased with strike prices anywhere from $110 in April to $200
in December. We are trading now strike prices in the options
that we haven’t traded significantly since 2008.”  Oil for April delivery declined 82 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to settle at $97.28 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, futures touched $103.41, the highest price
since Sept. 29, 2008. Prices are up 22 percent from a year ago.  April $100 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 5,605 lots changing hands. They dropped 44
cents to $2.60 a barrel. April $110 calls, the next-most active
contract, decreased 30 cents to 95 cents a barrel with 4,224
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Call Volume  The seven most-active contracts were April or June call
options at strike prices from $100 to $200. Together, the volume
in these contracts totaled more than 25,000 lots.  “The $150 contracts for September are about as far out as
they’re going right now in terms of any type of heavy trading,”
said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at OptionSellers.com in
Tampa,  Florida . “We haven’t seen the $175 to $200 trading and
probably won’t see that unless Saudi Arabia starts burning,
which I’m not sure is going to happen. We haven’t seen those
extreme far-out options trading yet or panic to buy those.”  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  Oil options trading reached a record volume of 324,655
contracts yesterday, topping by 10 percent the previous record

yesterday, with 18,179 lots changing hands. They gained 58 cents
to $1.25 a barrel. The next-most active option, April $120
calls, increased 48 cents to 84 cents a barrel on 16,048
contracts.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
39,647 contracts. Next were with April $100 calls 39,433 and
