  London Stock Exchange Group Plc ,
which trails NYSE Euronext and  Deutsche Boerse AG  in
derivatives, plans to offer futures and options contracts on
companies and indexes across Europe.  LSE will call the trading platform Turquoise Derivatives,
and will provide more details of the contracts by the end of
March, the exchange operator said in a statement today.  On Feb. 9, the LSE agreed to buy TMX in a C$3.2 billion
($3.25 billion) stock deal. LSE investors will own 55 percent of
the combined company and TMX shareholders will hold the rest.
EDX  London  runs on TMX’s SOLA derivatives trading technology.  LSE in 2001 tried and failed to buy the London-based Liffe
derivatives exchange, which  lists  futures and options on the
U.K.’s benchmark FTSE 100 Index and other European gauges.  NYSE
Euronext , the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, now owns
Liffe. NYSE and Deutsche Boerse, announced plans to form the
world’s biggest stock and derivatives exchange on the same day
that LSE said it will acquire TMX.  LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the London-based clearinghouse
that processes LSE’s trades, will offer clearing for LSE’s pan-
European derivatives market.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
