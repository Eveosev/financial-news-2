  Valero Energy Corp . is “increasing
toward planned rates” after completing maintenance on a crude
unit at the Houston plant, said  Bill Day , a company spokesman.  Planned maintenance activity may require flaring at the
northwest portion of the plant, the San Antonio-based company
said in a message left on a community hot line today.  The crude unit, which has a capacity of 90,000 barrels a
day, was scheduled to be shut for 24 days for maintenance and
inspections, the company said when it issued its turnaround
schedule on Jan. 26.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The refinery on the  Houston Ship Channel  can process
145,000 barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
