  Barratt Developments Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest homebuilder by volume, reported a narrower first-half
loss after it increased average selling prices.  The net loss shrank to 9 million pounds ($15 million) in
the six months through December from a loss of 127.4 million
pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement. Revenue was little changed at 878 million pounds. The
average price for a Barratt home increased 5.7 percent to
175,800 pounds.  U.K. home prices have fluctuated over the last several
months as a lack of supply supports values while fading  consumer
confidence , government budget cuts and reduced lending hurt
demand. Homebuilders are focusing on widening profit margins by
increasing the proportion of houses they build compared with
apartments and adding land for development after prices fell
after the financial crisis hit.  “Our focus will remain on tight cost control, further
efficiency improvements and increasing completions from the new
higher-margin land,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Clare said on
a conference call. “That will deliver further margin
improvement that we expect to see in the second half.”  The operating margin widened to 5 percent from 0.6 percent
a year earlier. Operating profit, which excludes finance costs,
increased to 43.5 million pounds from 5.2 million pounds a year
earlier. Net financing costs fell to 48.2 million pounds from
183 million pounds.  Barratt rose 2.1 percent to 101.2 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London trading, giving the company a market value of
977 million pounds.  Forward sales, or properties paid for and not yet built,
rose 5.4 percent to 893.5 million pound as of Feb. 20. The
company sold 4,832 homes, a decline of 4.4 percent compared with
a year earlier. About 65.1 percent of first-half sales were
houses, up from 60.2 percent a year earlier.  Net debt was 537 million pounds as of Dec. 31, compared
with 605.3 million pounds a year ago. The company forecast a
decline to 400 million pounds by June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
