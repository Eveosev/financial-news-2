Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, who
opposed  BHP Billiton Ltd .’s $40 billion bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., said any offer for Potash’s largest rival  Mosaic Co . was unlikely to attract a similar review by Canada.  “I was asked what if BHP or anyone else was interested in
another potash company?” Wall said today at an industry event
in London. “Mosaic is a major player. Its parent is Cargill, an
American company. I don’t think it would even trigger a review
by the national government.”  Cargill Inc. said last month it planned to split off its
majority stake in Mosaic, North America’s second-largest
fertilizer producer, in a $24.3 billion deal. Canada rejected
BHP’s offer for Potash Corp. in November as the world’s biggest
mining company failed to meet investment criteria.  Under the  Investment Canada Act , the government can block
any transaction valued at C$299 million ($303 million) or more
if it finds the deal doesn’t provide a “net benefit” to the
country.  “Mosaic is not Canadian so if they were in play today, I’m
not sure the Investment  Canada  process would even be
triggered,” Wall said. “I don’t think we’d ever get in the way
of that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
