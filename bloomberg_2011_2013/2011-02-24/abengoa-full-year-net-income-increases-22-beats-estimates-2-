Abengoa SA (ABG) , Spain’s biggest builder
of solar thermal plants, posted profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates, helped by revenue from Brazil and the U.S.  Full-year  net income  surged 22 percent to 207.2 million
euros ($286 million) from 170.3 million euros a year earlier,
the Seville-based company said in a statement today.  Sales soared 34 percent to 5.57 billion euros, and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 26
percent to 942 million euros, the company said. That compares
with an average 194.2 million euros in profit and 5.65 billion
euros in sales from analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales are expected to grow between 10 percent and 15
percent this year, Chief Executive Officer Manuel Sanchez said
today in a conference call. Ebitda will have a “low double-digit” growth, the company said in a presentation today.  “The outlook provided was moderately positive,” Manuel Dias Coelho, an analyst at Banco BPI SA in Porto, Portugal, said
by phone.  International  revenue , which accounted for 74 percent of
the total, climbed 32 percent to 4.14 billion euros, Abengoa
said.  Brazil  and the U.S. accounted for 20 percent and 16
percent of total sales, respectively.  Increased Investment  Abengoa boosted investment to grow in  biofuels , solar power
and engineering services outside its home market as the Spanish
economy suffered its worst economic crisis in decades. The
engineering and construction order book reached 9.27 billion
euros, “which provides a good outlook over the company’s
revenues for the next 24 months,” the company said.  Infrastructure and industrial production activities
increased as new plants improved capacity.  The company is developing 930 megawatts in solar projects
and has a further 380 megawatts yet to be financed, Sanchez
said. It has secured financing for a cellulosic ethanol project
in  Kansas  and doesn’t need to issue new corporate debt in 2011,
he added.  For the second half, net income climbed 32 percent to 115.3
million euros, as sales rose 26 percent to 2.95 billion euros.  Abengoa  shares  advanced 4.5 percent to close at 19.81 euros
in  Madrid  today. The stock has gained 7.8 percent this year,
valuing the company at 1.79 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
