Wheat extended a collapse and corn
and soybeans also fell as traders speculated that a jump in
energy costs caused by protests across North Africa and the
Middle East will curb growth and demand for grains.  Riots already ousted leaders in  Egypt , the world’s biggest
wheat importer, and in  Tunisia , and opposition groups have
seized control of eastern cities in  Libya . While wheat traded in
Chicago dropped 11 percent in the past four sessions, crude oil
jumped 13 percent on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.  Grain prices surged last month as North African and Middle
East nations bought more shipments to damp a surge in domestic
prices that helped spark the protests from  Morocco  to Bahrain.
Speculators including  hedge funds  last week cut their bets on
higher wheat prices by 20 percent, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show.  “Investors continue to exit grain positions in favor of
energy and financial markets due to anxiety over political
unrest in the Middle East and North Africa,”  Jim Gerlach ,
president of A/C Trading Inc., said by phone from Fowler,
Indiana. “The markets are focused on the negative impact that
higher energy prices may have on the global economy and food
demand.”  Wheat for May delivery fell 15.75 cents, or 2 percent, to
close at $7.825 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Yesterday, the price gained 0.3 percent on signs of
rising demand. Egypt bought 120,000 metric tons from  France  and
115,000 tons from the U.S., Nomani Nomani, vice chairman of the
General Authority for Supply Commodities, said yesterday.    Saudi Arabia   Saudi Arabia may buy 275,000 tons of milling wheat, CME
Group said in a report on its website. Iraq tendered for 100,000
tons of wheat this week.  Corn futures for May delivery declined 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $6.965 a bushel on the CBOT, and soybean
futures for May delivery dropped 2.25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
settle at $13.2925 a bushel. Corn and soybeans also closed
higher yesterday.  North African and Middle East countries are expected to buy
39.3 million tons of wheat in the 2010-2011 marketing year,
accounting for 32 percent of world purchases, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Agriculture Index of futures has
jumped 47 percent since July, and the United Nations said world
food prices rose 25 percent last year and reached a record in
January. U.S. food costs will rise as much as 4 percent this
year because of rising commodity prices,  Joe Glauber , the USDA’s
chief economist, said at a conference today.  Bigger Crops  Farmers will harvest a record 13.73 billion bushels of
corn, up from 12.447 billion last year, with 5 billion bushels
devoted to ethanol, compared with 4.95 billion for the 2010
crop, Glauber said at the department’s annual outlook conference
in Arlington, Virginia, today.  Hedge-fund managers and other speculators held a net-long
position, or bets on higher  Chicago  wheat prices, of 34,193
contracts as of Feb. 15, CFTC data show. A week earlier, they
held 42,635 contracts, the most since 1997.  “It’s not surprising to see the declines because of
increasing risk aversion in the market,” said  Eugen Weinberg ,
the head of commodity research at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt .
“Gold is inching higher, and oil is definitely experiencing
some inflows.”  Oil traded in New York rose as much as 5.4 percent to
$103.41 a barrel today, before closing at $97.28, down 0.8
percent. Gold rose $1.80 to close at $1,415.80 an ounce in New
York, the Swiss franc climbed to a record against the dollar,
and the yen strengthened to a two-week high as investors sought
assets perceived to be safer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
