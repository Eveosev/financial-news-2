Polandâ€™s zloty slumped to the
weakest level in more than two months against the euro as the
uprising in  Libya  dampened demand for riskier assets.  The zloty slid as much as 0.6 percent to 4.0020 per euro,
the lowest intraday level since Dec. 22. It traded 0.5 percent
weaker at 3.9991 as of 1:30 p.m. in Warsaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
