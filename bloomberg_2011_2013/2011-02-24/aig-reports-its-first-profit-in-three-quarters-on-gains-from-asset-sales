  American International Group Inc .,
the insurer selling assets to repay a U.S. bailout, posted its
first profit in three quarters on gains from divestitures.  Fourth-quarter net income of $11.2 billion, or $16.60 a
share, compares with a loss of $8.87 billion, or $65.51, a year
earlier, the New York-based insurer said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The result included $17.6 billion of gains
from divested businesses. The insurer posted an after-tax
operating loss of $2.2 billion.  Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche , 66, raised almost
$37 billion last year selling American Life Insurance Co. to
MetLife Inc. and divesting a majority stake in AIA Group Ltd. in
a public offering. Benmosche is adding to reserves, hiring risk
managers, and settling lawsuits and regulatory probes as he
prepares the company for private ownership. The U.S. Treasury
Department accumulated 92 percent of AIG’s stock and plans to
divest its holdings.  “Some of the transactions resulted in larger gains than
expected,” said Jonathan Hatcher, a Jefferies Group Inc.
analyst in  New York . The gains boosted capital and should make
the company “feel a little bit more comfortable with the
reserve additions that they needed.”  Shareholders’ equity, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose to $85.3 billion on Dec. 31 from $80.8 billion
on Sept. 30. The insurer booked gains on asset sales, including
Hong Kong-based AIA and Alico, which operates in countries from  Chile  to  Poland  to Japan.  Shares Gain  AIG advanced 41 cents to $40.84 in extended trading in New
York yesterday. The insurer is scheduled today to hold its first
conference call with analysts since May 2009.  “The initial response has been positive,”  Clark Troy , a
senior analyst based in  Chapel Hill ,  North Carolina , for Aite
Group, said of the results. “They’re absolutely trying to put
their best foot forward, and the Street in time will tell
whether or not they’ve been successful.”  AIG earned $7.8 billion for the year, compared with losses
of $10.9 billion in 2009 and $99.3 billion in 2008. Profit was
$6.2 billion in 2007. AIA, the third-largest Asian insurer by
market value, posted profit of $2.7 billion for the year ended
Nov. 30, a gain of 54 percent.  The operating loss for the Chartis division, which sells
coverage of commercial property, corporate boards and airplanes,
widened to $3.97 billion from $1.75 billion a year earlier as
the company added to reserves. Chartis spent 160.5 cents per
every premium dollar on claims and expenses, compared with 132.5
cents a year earlier.  Setting Prices  “Pricing is not as strong as it should be,” Benmosche
said in remarks posted on AIG’s website. “We need to remember
that, as we do business today, we’ll wake up in a couple years
and still be here and have to deal with the prices we’ve charged
today, and it’s important that we don’t shortchange the
future.”  AIG was forced to bolster reserves in the fourth quarters
of 2010 and 2009 after determining it put aside insufficient
funds to cover claims on casualty policies sold in prior years.
Rivals including Travelers Cos. and Chubb Corp. have booked
profits after determining they’d set aside more than needed.  Investment income rose 10 percent to $5.46 billion as
alternative assets, including private-equity and hedge-fund
holdings, generated $650 million compared with  $443 million  a
year earlier. Buyout funds earned $419 million and hedge funds
gained $231 million. AIG had $18.8 billion in so-called
partnership assets as of Dec. 31, compared with  $18.5 billion  on
Sept. 30.  The plane business, International Lease Finance Corp.,
posted a $606 million operating loss, compared with a $344
million gain a year earlier as the company took writedowns on
its fleet. Benmosche said in his remarks that AIG may
“ultimately find a way to monetize” the plane unit, without
providing specifics.  The insurer’s maximum risk on a book of swaps sold to
European banks narrowed to $38.1 billion as of Dec. 31, compared
with $65.5 billion as of Sept. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
