OAO Russian Railways’s net income
more than quadrupled in the first half of 2010 from the same
period a year earlier, said Vadim Mikhailov, the national rail
monopoly’s senior vice president for finance.  Profit advanced to 110.5 billion rubles, Mikhailov told
reporters today in Moscow. Revenue climbed 22 percent to 651
billion rubles in the first six months of 2010, while earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, surged 85 percent to 204.8 billion rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
