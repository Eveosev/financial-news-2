Most U.S. stocks rose, halting a
two-day slide, as oil’s retreat below $100 a barrel eased
concern that surging energy prices will hurt the economic
recovery.    Boeing Co . climbed the most in the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  as government data showed demand for aircraft rebounded.  Priceline.com Inc . rallied 8.9 percent after the online travel
agency’s first-quarter earnings forecast topped analysts’
estimates, while  Target Corp . advance 4 percent after predicting
a 50 percent sales increase over the next seven years.  About seven stocks advanced for every five that fell on
U.S. exchanges as of 3:27 p.m. in New York. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.1 percent to 1,308.39 after dropping
as much as 1 percent earlier as crude rallied to a more-than
two-year high of $103.41. The Dow slipped 19.83 points, or 0.2
percent, to 12,085.95, reversing most of a 123-point slump  “We’re certainly watching a battle between nerves and
economic fundamentals,” said Bruce McCain, who oversees $25
billion as chief investment strategist at the private-banking
unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland . “For the most part, economic data
points in the U.S. have been good,” he said. “The focus will
be on oil, rumors and their implications.”  U.S. stocks fell for a second day yesterday, dragging
benchmark indexes to the biggest two-day drop in six months, as
oil surged amid growing tensions in the Middle East and Hewlett-
Packard Co.’s forecasts trailed estimates. The  S&P 500  had risen
4 percent in 2011 through yesterday as reports showed an
improving economy and earnings beat analysts’ estimates for the
eighth straight quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Economy Watch  The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.3 percent earlier today as
Labor Department figures showed that applications for jobless
benefits fell by 22,000 to 391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19.
Economists forecast claims would drop to 405,000, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Separately, a gauge of consumer confidence climbed last
week to the highest level since April 2008. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index, formerly the ABC News U.S. Weekly
Consumer Comfort Index, was minus 39.2 in the period to Feb. 20,
compared with minus 43.4 the prior week. Forty-nine percent of
those polled held positive views on their financial situation,
the most in a year.    Hedge funds  increased their net leverage in January to the
highest level since October 2007, as they took advantage of
record-low borrowing costs to bet that the U.S. equity rally
will continue. Debt at margin accounts at the New York Stock
Exchange minus cash and unused credit climbed to $46 billion,
according to data released by NYSE yesterday.  “It makes a lot of sense given the low cost of borrowing
and some equities’ valuations,” said Patrick Armstrong, who
helps manage $356 million in multiasset strategies at Armstrong
Investment Managers LLP in  London . “There is a capital-
structure arbitrage to be made by buying stocks with leverage.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
