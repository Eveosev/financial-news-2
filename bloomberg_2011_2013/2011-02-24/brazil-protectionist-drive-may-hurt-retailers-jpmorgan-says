“Protectionist” Brazilian
government initiatives to shore up local industry amid rising
imports would hurt retailers while benefiting makers of
industrial goods, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said.  Higher import tariffs would boost costs for retailers Lojas
Renner SA, Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar
and  Guararapes Confeccoes SA , analysts at JPMorgan, including
Emy Shayo Cherman, wrote in a note to clients today.  Industrial-goods makers Marcopolo SA, Weg SA, Randon SA
Implementos e Participacoes and  Iochpe-Maxion SA  would benefit
from the measures, which may include tax breaks, according to
JPMorgan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
