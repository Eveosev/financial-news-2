Abellon CleanEnergy Ltd., an Indian
renewable energy company, plans to create 25,000 jobs in  Ghana 
and build a factory to produce solid biofuels, the United
Nations Development Program said.  Ahmedabad-based Abellon will grow crops that require little
irrigation such as bamboo, palmarosa and sweet sorghum on 10,000
hectares of derelict land, the UNDP said today in an e-mailed
 statement . About 21,000 farmers will be employed, with another
4,000 jobs created at a planned biofuels factory to convert the
plants to fuels, and a power plant to burn it, the agency said.  Pragnesh Mishra, a local project manager in Ghana for
Abellon, said the company expects to begin making solid biofuel
this year, with the power plant being completed by 2015 in
Ghana’s Ashanti region. The fuel will be exported until the
plant is built, he said.  “We’re manufacturing solid biofuel for export to the U.S.
and  Europe ,” Mishra said in a telephone interview today.
“There’s a big market for that.” He declined to detail the
cost of the project or the generating capacity of the plant.  The UNDP said the plant may power as many as 100,000 homes.
Mishra said he hopes to secure financing for the project in the
next few months. The UNDP has provided advice, though not money
for the plan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
