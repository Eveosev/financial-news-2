European Union carbon permits
advanced to a three-month high as rising German power and U.K.
natural gas prices boosted demand for emission allowances.  EU permits for delivery in December closed at 15.40 euros
($21.24) on  London ’s European Climate Exchange after rising as
much as 1.5 percent to 15.52 euros a metric ton, the highest
intraday level since Nov. 25.  The contract extended this month’s gain to 2.8 percent as
the European Commission. The EU regulator is considering
withholding 500 million to 800 million allowances in the next
round of the bloc’s cap-and-trade program from 2013. The amount
would correspond to the surplus that can be carried over from
the current five-year phase that ends in 2012, according to the
commission estimates in a draft document circulated last week.  German baseload power for next month gained 0.6 percent to
51.50 euros a megawatt-hour, according to broker prices on
Bloomberg. Higher power prices can strengthen the incentive to
sell electricity forward, stimulating demand for CO2 permits.  U.K. natural gas for delivery next month rose 0.5 percent
to 54.5 pence a therm. Higher gas prices may prompt some power
utilities to burn more coal, which requires about twice as many
carbon permits to use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
