     Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -  TransAlta Corp ., Canada’s largest
publicly traded electricity producer, is interested in buying
power assets in  Canada  and the U.S., Chief Executive Officer
Steve Snyder said today.  TransAlta wants to add renewable power, including  wind
turbines , in Canada as well as power plants on the west coast of
the U.S. and Canada, Snyder told investors during a conference
call today.  “We have a strong interest in expanding our fleet
profitably,” he said.  TransAlta is Canada’s largest wind power operator and is
preparing to phase out coal-burning plants in the coming
decades. The company added 189 megawatts of new wind power
generation as well as a hydro-power plant in neighboring British
Columbia last year.  TransAlta, based in Calgary, today said fourth-quarter
profit fell to C$62 million, or C$0.28 a share, from C$79
million, or C$0.37 because of hedging costs, “weak”
electricity prices and costs associated with decommissioning a
plant.  The shares were down 0.1 percent to $20.56 as of 12:22 p.m.
on the Toronto stock exchange, valuing the company at about
C$4.5 billion. The stock has declined 2.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
