Poland’s WIG20 equity index erased
yesterday’s gain and retreated 0.7 percent, closing at 2,653.94.  The following are among the most active stocks on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.    KGHM Polska Miedz SA  (KGH PW), Poland’s only copper
producer, slumped 0.3 percent to 163.5 zloty, its third day of
losses. Three-month copper fell on the London Metal Exchange on
concern that rising geopolitical tension in the Middle East and
North Africa may hamper global growth.    Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA  (PGN PW)
retreated 2 percent, the most since Jan. 10, to 3.85 zloty after
the dominant Polish gas company said it is analyzing the sales
of Warsaw heat distributor SPEC SA and its Vattenfall unit and
would prefer to buy both companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
