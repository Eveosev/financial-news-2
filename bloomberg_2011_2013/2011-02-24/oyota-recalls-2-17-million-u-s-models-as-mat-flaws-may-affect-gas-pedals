  Toyota Motor Corp ., the world’s
biggest carmaker, rose the most in almost two weeks in Tokyo
trading after U.S. regulators concluded a yearlong investigation
that spurred the largest recalls in the company’s history.  The  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  ended a
probe into unintended acceleration after asking Toyota to recall
an additional 2.17 million vehicles, NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  President  Akio Toyoda ’s first full year on the job was
consumed by a series of recalls that totaled more than 10
million vehicles ranging from luxury Lexus SUVs to Prius hybrids.
Toyoda, 54, was called to testify before the  U.S. Congress  on
the automaker’s safety record, and the company’s sales slumped.  “NHSTA closing the investigation is the ‘go-ahead’ sign for
Toyota in the U.S. as it doesn’t have to worry about further
allegations from the government,” said Fukoku Capital Management
Inc. President  Yuuki Sakurai , who manages about 180 billion yen
($2.2 billion) in Tokyo, including Toyota shares. “Still, they
have to face the reality of having lost share, and it won’t be
easy to get it back.”  Toyota called back millions of U.S. vehicles in 2009 and
2010, mostly for defects related to unintended acceleration. The
carmaker also paid a record $48.8 million in fines for how some
of the recalls were conducted. The recalls caused the Toyota
City, Japan-based company to briefly halt sales of some models
in 2010 and contributed to its 0.4 percent U.S. sales decrease
last year, the only such decline among large automakers.  Latest Recall  Shares of the automaker gained 2.2 percent, the most since
Feb. 14, to 3,755 yen at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo trading. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.7 percent.  “The market looked favorably on NHTSA announcing that
their investigation into Toyota is closed,” said Toshihiko Matsuno, an analyst at SMBC Friend Securities Co.’s investment
advisory department.  Toyota’s latest recall, its biggest in a year, includes
1.38 million vehicles being added to the company’s November 2009
announcement to fix floor mats that could shift out of position,
the company said yesterday in a statement. The move came exactly
a year after Toyoda testified before U.S. lawmakers about record
recalls associated with unintended acceleration.  Investigation Closed  “As a result of the agency’s review, NHTSA asked Toyota to
recall these additional vehicles, and now that the company has
done so, our investigation is closed,” Strickland said.  The end of the investigation follows a report by U.S.
safety regulators and  NASA , the U.S. space agency, that said
they were unable to find any electronic cause for unintended
acceleration in Toyotas. Last year’s recalls were for floor mat-
related entrapment of accelerator pedals and for pedals supplied
by  CTS Corp . that could stick.  The vehicles in the expanded U.S. recall include 603,000
model 2003 through 2009 4Runner sport-utility vehicles, 761,000
model 2006 through 2010 RAV4 SUVs and 17,000 model 2008 through
2011 Lexus LX SUVs.  Toyota is also recalling 769,000 model 2004 through early
2007 models of the Highlander and Highlander Hybrid, and 2004
through 2006 Lexus RX330, RX350 and RX400h SUVs to replace
driver’s side floor-carpet covers and retention clips. About
20,000 model 2006 through early 2007 Lexus GS sedans are being
recalled to adjust the shape of the plastic pad in the driver’s
side carpet. In each case, carpets could shift and potentially
interfere with the accelerator.  ‘Sloppy Designs’  “It just echoes a bit of sloppy designs, a lack of
attention to detail,” said  Rebecca Lindland , an analyst at IHS
Automotive in Lexington,  Massachusetts . “That’s really not
something we would have ever associated with Toyota a year
ago.”  In Canada, an additional 147,300 vehicles are being
recalled, said Sandy Di Felice, a spokeswoman for Toyota  Canada .  In Europe, the company is recalling 37,174 Lexus RX cars
manufactured between 2003 and 2006, Etienne Plas, a Toyota  Europe  spokesman, said by telephone, adding that the company
hasn’t received any complaints there. The plastic floor-carpet
cover may obstruct pedals if its fastening clips are inserted
incorrectly, he said.  Toyota didn’t include vehicles sold in Japan or  China , as
models sold there were unaffected by the flaws, the company said.  Separately, NHTSA opened an investigation last week of
Highlander Hybrids after receiving 32 customer complaints about
2006 model year vehicles being prone to stalling. The company
hasn’t yet received NHTSA’s request for information on that
matter, Lyons said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
