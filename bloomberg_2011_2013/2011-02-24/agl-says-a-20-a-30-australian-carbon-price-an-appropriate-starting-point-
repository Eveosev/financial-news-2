  AGL Energy Ltd . said an Australian
carbon price of A$20 to A$30 a ton would be “an appropriate
starting point,” after Prime Minister Julia Gillard today
announced plans to impose a cost on emissions starting July next
year.  “We welcome today’s announcement as an important first
step towards providing investment certainty for business as we
begin the transition to a low carbon environment,” AGL Managing
Director Michael Fraser said in an e-mailed statement. “We
would support the move to a market based mechanism such as an
emissions trading system as quickly as possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
