Magyar Telekom Nyrt. rose to the
highest in almost a month after the Hungarian phone unit of
Deutsche Telekom AG unexpectedly reported a fourth-quarter
profit following an income tax credit.  The shares advanced 2.8 percent to 554 forint, the
strongest closing level since Jan. 27, making it the best
performer within the 12-member BUX Index, which rose 0.8
percent. Magyar Telekom constitutes 12 percent of the gauge’s
weighting.  Net income dropped to 7.5 billion forint ($37.6 million)
from 10.2 billion forint a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Budapest bourse today. The average estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 9.9
billion forint. Magyar Telekom, which reported a loss of 7.3
billion forint before income taxes, booked 17 billion forint in
tax credits for the quarter.  “Magyar Telekom reported key financial figures above our
and market estimates,” Jindrich Svatek, an analyst at
Raiffeisen Centrobank AG in Vienna, said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
