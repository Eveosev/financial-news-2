  Segro Plc , the U.K.’s largest owner
of business parks and warehouses, reported a full-year profit
after the value of its properties increased.  Net income was 210.3 million pounds ($340 million) or 28.5
pence a share, compared with a loss of 233.1 million pounds, or
41.3 pence, a year earlier, the Slough, England-based company
said today in a statement. Profit excluding changes in property
values rose 22 percent as the company benefited from its 2009
acquisition of rival Brixton Plc.  U.K. industrial rents fell by 1.4 percent in 2010, compared
with a 1.8 percent gain for offices and a drop of 1.5 percent
for shops, according to research group Investment Property
Databank Ltd. Segro’s overall vacancy rate declined to 12
percent from 13.5 percent a year earlier, the company said.
Former Brixton properties helped drive a 4.7 percent increase in
net rental income, the company said.  “If you strip out the effect of the Brixton acquisition,
adjusted income would be broadly flat,” said Robert Duncan, an
analyst at Nomura International in  London  with a “neutral”
recommendation on the shares.  Profit excluding property value changes increased to 126
million pounds, or 17.1 pence a share, from 103.4 million
pounds, or 18.3 pence, a year earlier. That beat 16.9 pence a
share, the average of 15 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The company held two share sales last year.  Customer inquiries in the U.K. rose by about 25 percent
last year, with about 10 percent to 12 percent resulting in
deals, Chief Executive Officer Ian Coull said on a conference
call.  “Our indicators are a pretty good touchstone for the
economy as a whole,” he said. “Looking at the economies of  Europe  and the U.K., we see recovery under way.”  Segro fell 2.8 percent to 313.6 pence at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London trading, giving the company a market value of
2.33 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
