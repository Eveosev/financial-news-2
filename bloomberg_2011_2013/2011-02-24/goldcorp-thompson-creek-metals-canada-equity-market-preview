Canadian stocks rose, capping an
eighth-straight monthly gain, after the country’s economic
growth accelerated and  Lundin Mining Corp . received another
takeover offer.  Base-metals producer Lundin soared 19 percent after Equinox
Minerals Ltd. bid C$4.8 billion ($4.9 billion), 17 percent more
than Inmet Mining Corp.’s January buyout agreement. Quadra FNX
Mining Ltd. rose 5.2 percent after its profit beat analyst
estimates.  Suncor Energy Inc ., the country’s biggest oil and gas
producer, added 1.7 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 84.4 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 14,136.5 in Toronto for a 4.3 percent
increase in February. The streak of eight monthly gains is the
longest since May 2007.  “There is still a lot of interest in natural resources,
which is a continuing trend,” said Stephen Gauthier, who helps
oversee C$500 million ($513 million) as a money manager at Fin-
XO Securities in  Montreal . “We also had some GDP numbers that
were very positive for the market.”  Canadian gross domestic product expanded at a 3.3 percent
annual pace in the fourth quarter following a 1.8 percent
expansion in the previous three months that was higher than
initially estimated,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.
Economists predicted a 3 percent fourth-quarter gain, according
to the median of 23 estimates gathered by Bloomberg News.  Merger Market  The bid for Lundin is the second-biggest pending offer this
year on the Canadian equity benchmark index by total value. On

for C$5.4 billion ($5.4 billion), the largest pending deal by
value in  Canada  in 2011.  Lundin advanced 19 percent to C$7.65, the biggest gain in
the Canadian benchmark equity index. Copper and platinum

adjusted basis, beating the average analyst estimate by 44
percent, Bloomberg data show.  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer, advanced 1.7 percent to C$59.86 after
Gleacher & Co. raised its rating to “buy” from “neutral.”  Suncor advanced 1.7 percent to $C45.66, leading a gain
among energy producers. Oil slipped 91 cents to settle at $96.97
a barrel in New York. Natural gas for April delivery rose 3.2
