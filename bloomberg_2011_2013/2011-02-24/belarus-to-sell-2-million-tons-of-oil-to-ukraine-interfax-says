ZAO Belarusian Oil Co. is seeking to
sell 2 million tons of oil products to Ukraine this year,
Interfax-Ukraine reported, citing Nikolay Vasilevich, head of
the companyâ€™s Ukrainian unit, TOV BNK-Ukraine.  This volume will be supplied unless Ukraine introduces
import custom duty for oil, the Kiev-based news agency cited
Vasilevich as saying.  Belarusian Oil has signed long-term accords with Ukrainian
filling station chains Okko and Wog to supply 30,000 tons of oil
products a month, Interfax reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
