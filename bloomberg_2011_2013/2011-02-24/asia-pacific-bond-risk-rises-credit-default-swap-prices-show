The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment rose, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 1.5 basis points to
106 basis points as of 9:30 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan rose 1 basis point to 112 as of
8:30 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 110
basis points as of 11:25 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit
quality . An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the securities if a borrower
fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
