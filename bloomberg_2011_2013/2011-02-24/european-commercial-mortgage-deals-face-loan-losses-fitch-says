Losses on loans packaged into
commercial mortgage-backed securities are accelerating in  Europe 
as borrowers struggle to refinance,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Losses were registered on six loans in 2010, with four in
the fourth quarter, the ratings company said in a statement. No
losses were allocated in 2009.  “Fitch expects losses to become a bigger driver over the
next year,” Gioia Dominedo, a London-based analyst at Fitch,
said in the statement.  Borrowers repaid 59 out of a total 115 loans maturing last
year and the default rate more than doubled to 12.6 percent,
compared with 5.4 percent a year earlier, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
