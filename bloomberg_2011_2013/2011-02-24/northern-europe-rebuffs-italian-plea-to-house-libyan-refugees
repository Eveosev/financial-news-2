Northern European countries rebuffed  Italy ’s request to share the burden of sheltering a possible
flood of refugees from political upheavals in northern  Africa .  Six countries along the Mediterranean Sea coast yesterday
called for a “special solidarity fund” and a system for
distributing asylum-seekers to reception centers across the 27-
nation European Union.  German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere today played
down the threat of a mass exodus across the Mediterranean and
said the EU’s focus should be on rebuilding countries like Libya
after the ouster of autocratic regimes.  “Italy is under strain, but it is far from overstrained,”
de Maiziere told reporters at a meeting of EU justice ministers
in Brussels today. “There haven’t been any huge refugee flows
so far and we shouldn’t talk them up.”  EU officials disputed Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni’s estimate that as many as 1 million Libyans might try to
escape to  Europe  in the event of all-out civil war. Libyans have
a tradition of staying put, a senior EU official told reporters
in Brussels.  “I ask Europe to settle all the necessary measures to deal
with a catastrophic humanitarian emergency,” Maroni said. “We
cannot be left alone.”  More than 6,000 refugees from  Tunisia  have swamped the
Italian island of Lampedusa, just 110 kilometers (70 miles) from
the African mainland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
