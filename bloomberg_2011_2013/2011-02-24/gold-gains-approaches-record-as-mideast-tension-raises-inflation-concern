Gold fluctuated near a seven-week
high in  New York  as continuing violence in Libya and concern
that inflation will accelerate boosted demand for the metal as
an alternative investment.  Loyalists of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sought to crush
dissent in Tripoli as opponents tightened control of eastern
cities and U.S. President  Barack Obama  called for international
pressure on the regime to end its attacks. Bullion traded within
1 percent of its December record as  oil prices  advanced.  “Gold is poised to challenge December’s all-time high,”
James Moore, an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in
a report. “The mix of safe-haven demand, inflation concerns and
strong retail demand continues to support higher prices.”  Gold futures for April delivery added as much as $4.50, or
0.3 percent, to $1,418.50 an ounce, the highest price since Jan.
3, and were at $1,418.30 at 8:11 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Prices also slipped as much as 0.4 percent. The metal for
immediate delivery in  London  was 0.4 percent higher at
$1,417.26.  Bullion rose to $1,414.50 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,409.25 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Libya’s revolt is raising speculation climbing fuel costs
will spur inflation. The  United Nations ’ World Food Price Index
gained to a record last month. Minutes of the  Bank of England ’s
most recent meeting showed a third policy maker voted for
raising  interest rates  to curb inflation that’s running at twice
the bank’s target.  Record High  Concern about rising inflation and currency debasement
drove  gold prices  up 30 percent last year for a 10th annual
gain, lifting futures to a record $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7.
Increasing food and commodity prices have contributed to
uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa.    Libya  is the latest country in the region to be rocked by
protests ignited by last month’s ouster of Tunisia’s president
and fanned by the Feb. 11 fall of the Egyptian president. With
Qaddafi employing more force to quash revolts than leaders in
other Arab countries engulfed by mass demonstrations, analysts
said the country may descend into civil war. Oil surged to $100
a barrel in New York for the first time in two years.  “Escalating unrest in Libya and rising oil prices have
encouraged gold safe-haven buying and fueled concerns over
inflation, which also benefits gold,”  Mark Pervan , senior
analyst with ANZ Banking Group Ltd., wrote in a note.  ETP Holdings  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.6 metric ton
to 2,015.39 tons yesterday, rebounding from the lowest level
since June 7, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.
Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December. Silver ETP
assets advanced 61.39 tons to 14,713.45 tons, the highest level
since Jan. 21, data from four providers show.  Silver for May delivery in New York added 0.5 percent to
$33.48 an ounce. It climbed to $34.315 on Feb. 22, the highest
price since March 1980, the year futures reached a record
$50.35.  Palladium for June delivery fell 0.7 percent to $771.05 an
ounce. It tumbled 3.9 percent yesterday and touched a 10-year
high of $863.70 on Feb. 22. Platinum for April delivery was 0.4
percent higher at $1,783.10 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
