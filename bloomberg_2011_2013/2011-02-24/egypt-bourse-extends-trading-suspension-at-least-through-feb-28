Egypt’s stock exchange will remain
closed through at least Feb. 28 and will meet on Feb. 27 to
assess its readiness to resume trading, bourse spokesman Hisham
Turk said.  The market, closed since Jan. 27 after the onset of
protests that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak ’s 30-year-old
regime on Feb. 11, needs time to implement changes aimed at
limiting losses when trading starts, Turk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
