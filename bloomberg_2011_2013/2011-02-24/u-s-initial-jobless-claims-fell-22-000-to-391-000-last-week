The number of Americans filing
first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  fell more than
forecast last week, indicating an improving labor market.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 22,000 to
391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would drop to 405,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Claims have fallen in three of the past four weeks, pushing down
the monthly average to the lowest level since July 2008.  Companies may begin to ratchet up hiring after reducing
firings, which will bring unemployment down further. That would
help allay concerns from Federal Reserve policy makers who
expressed “disappointment in both the pace and the unevenness
of the improvements in labor markets” in the minutes of their
Jan. 25-26 meeting released last week.  “The labor market has been on the upswing,” Millan
Mulraine, a senior U.S. strategist at TD Securities Inc. in  New
York , said before the report. “As the pace of layoffs continues
to decline, it is an indication that not only are businesses not
firing as fast they used to, but they may in fact begin
hiring.”  Prior Week  Jobless claims estimates in the Bloomberg News survey of 51
economists ranged from 375,000 to 420,000. The Labor Department
initially reported the prior week’s figures at 410,000.  There were no special factors affecting the figures, a
Labor Department official said today.  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure, fell
to 402,000 from 418,500 last week.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
fell by 145,000 in the week ended Feb. 12 to 3.79 million.  Economists forecast the number would decline to 3.88
million. Figures for continuing claims do not include the number
of workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their benefits and are now collecting
emergency and extended payments decreased by 55,330 to 4.45
million in the week ended Feb. 5.  The unemployment among those eligible for benefits, which
tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 3.0 percent. That is
the lowest since November 2008, according to a Labor Department
official.  Thirty-five states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 18 had an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Federal Reserve policy makers will likely keep  interest
rates  near zero and maintain plans to buy $600 billion in  Treasury securities  to boost the pace of recovery until they see
signs of sustained  job creation .  Employers hired 183,000 workers in February as the  unemployment rate  rose to 9.1 percent, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of next
week’s employment report. The Labor Department will release the
figures March 4.  Payroll Increase  Last month, payrolls increased a fewer-than-forecast 36,000
while the jobless rate unexpectedly fell to 9 percent, the
lowest since April 2009, the Labor Department reported Feb. 4.
Unemployment dropped to 9.4 percent in December from 9.8 percent
the previous month.  While touring an  Intel Corp . semiconductor manufacturing
facility in Hillsboro,  Oregon , last week, President  Barack Obama 
said the U.S. must foster a business climate that encourages job
creation and assures companies can draw on an educated
workforce.  “In a world that is more competitive than ever before,
it’s our job to make sure that America is the best place on
earth to do business,” Obama said Feb. 18 at the factory.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, announced plans during
the president’s visit to build a $5 billion microprocessor plant
in Arizona and hire 4,000 employees in the U.S. this year.  The workers will focus on product development, research and
design,  Paul Otellini , chief executive officer of Intel, said as
he showed Obama around the plant, west of  Portland . The new
factory will be built at the company’s existing site in
Chandler,  Arizona .    Santa Clara , California-based Intel is expanding its
factory network to meet increasing demand for chips. The company
said last month that it would spend $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion
on plants and equipment this year, compared with $5.2 billion in
2010. Revenue may rise 14 percent to $49.5 billion this year,
according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
