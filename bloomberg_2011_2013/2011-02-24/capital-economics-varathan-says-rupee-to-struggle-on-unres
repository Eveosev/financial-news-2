Vishnu Varathan, an economist at  Capital Economics  (Asia) Pte in Singapore, comments on the
outlook for the Indian rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency slid
0.2 percent to 45.51 per dollar as of 11:32 a.m. in Singapore,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect
bets the rupee will decline 0.5 percent from the spot rate of
45.26.  “We are expecting the rupee to struggle a bit. The
current-account position is weak and it will continue to be weak
for a while and inflation is not allowing fiscal consolidation
in the policy formulation.  “The unrest in the Middle East is also making it tough in
terms of oil prices and remittances into  India . The central bank
is in a difficult situation.  “The headline news from the Middle East and accelerating
inflation in  Asia  will curb the central bank’s intentions for
fiscal consolidation.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
