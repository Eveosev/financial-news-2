(Corrects nominee’s name in second paragraph.)  Glass, Lewis & Co., an advisory
service, recommended that OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel shareholders
vote for the early termination of the company’s board at a March
11 meeting, according to 25 percent holder United Co. Rusal.  Stockholders were advised to vote for independent nominees
Lucian Bebchuck, a professor at  Harvard Law School , and Gerard Holden, a consultant at Rockbury Services Inc., Rusal said today
in an e-mailed statement.  Rusal called the March meeting to re-elect Norilsk’s board,
after a June vote gave the aluminum company three seats to
Interros Holding Co.’s four. While a meeting in October voted
against the early termination of the board, Norilsk’s directors
on Feb. 14 recommended re-election and approved a list of 27
candidates for 13 seats.  Among the nominees, two are from Trafigura Beheer BV, the
commodities trader that agreed to buy 8 percent of Moscow-based
Norilsk last year. Rusal has filed court petitions in the U.S.
and the U.K. to obtain information on the December sale of
shares to Trafigura and a subsequent stock buyback.  Rusal’s CEO Oleg Deripaska has been locked in a dispute
with Interros billionaire  Vladimir Potanin  since 2008 over
control of Norilsk. The nickel company on Feb. 11 increased a
bid to buy back shares held by Rusal, offering $12.8 billion for
20 percent of its stock. Deripaska has rebuffed the proposal.  Interros owns almost 30 percent of Norilsk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
