  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
Irish unit’s operating loss doubled last year as losses from
souring real estate loans surged.  Ulster Bank Ltd.’s operating loss widened to 761 million
pounds in 2010 from 368 million pounds the previous year,
Edinburgh-based RBS said in a  statement  today. Impairment losses
climbed to 1.16 billion pounds in 2010 from 649 million pounds.
RBS also reported 2.73 billion pounds of impairment losses on
loans Ulster Bank transferred to the group’s non-core division
in 2009, it said.  RBS acquired Ulster Bank in 2000 as part of its purchase of
National Westminster Bank Plc. RBS expanded in Ireland in 2003
through the acquisition of First Active Plc, the country’s
oldest building society. The Edinburgh-based lender injected
almost 3 billion pounds into  Ulster Bank  between 2008 and 2009
as Irish lenders grappled with soaring bad loan losses following
the implosion of a domestic real-estate bubble.  Ulster Bank’s performance should improve “somewhat” in
the second half, although “we remain cautious” on the Irish
economic outlook, RBS said in today’s statement.  The lender is still looking for a Chief Executive Officer
to replace Cormac McCarthy, who said in July he would step down.  Ulster Bank transferred  16.7 billion pounds  of its loan
book to RBS’s non-core unit in 2009, leaving it with 39.7
billion pounds of loans.  About 6 percent of Ulster Bank’s 21.1 billion pounds of
mortgages were in arrears of more than three months at the end
of 2010, almost double the proportion the previous year.  Ulster Bank agreed “forbearance arrangements” on 5.8
percent its mortgages at the end of December as it increase
“the level of support to customers experiencing temporary
financial difficulties,” RBS said.  Ulster Bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio fell to 152 percent at
the end of the year from 177 percent the previous year, it said.
That was helped by 1.7 billion-euro ($2.3 billion) jump in
customer deposits, according to analysts including Fergal O’Leary and  Jim Ryan  of Glas Securities.  Ulster Bank was “a clear beneficiary of the migration of
deposits from Irish government-guaranteed banks,” the analysts
wrote in a note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
