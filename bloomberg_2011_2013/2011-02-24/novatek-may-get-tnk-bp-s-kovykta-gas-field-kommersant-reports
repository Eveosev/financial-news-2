OAO Novatek,  Russia ’s largest non-
state gas producer, may win the auction for TNK-BP’s bankrupt
OAO Rusia Petroleum unit, which holds the license to the giant
Kovykta gas deposit in eastern Siberia, Kommersant reported,
without citing anyone.    OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas-export monopoly, doesn’t want to
lead development of the field because it has other big projects,
though it will probably be involved in Kovykta, the Moscow-based
newspaper reported.    To contact the reporter on this story:
