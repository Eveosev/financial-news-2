Ukraineâ€™s government aims to cancel
state subsidies for farmers growing sugar beets,  Ekonomicheskie
Izvestia  reported, citing Agriculture Minister Mykola
Prysyazhnyuk.  The subsidy for growing beets on 1 hectare (2.5 acres) was
500 hryvnia ($62.90) in 2010, according to the Kiev-based
newspaper. Ukrtsukor, which represents sugar producers in the
country, is seeking a threefold increase for this year to 1,500
hryvnia, Ekonomicheskie Izvestia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
