  NIC Bank Ltd ., a Kenyan lender, said
full-year profit rose 71 percent as income from lending grew.  Net income increased to 1.86 billion shillings ($23
million), or 5 shillings per share, in the 12 months through
December from 1.09 billion shillings, or 3 shillings a share, a
year earlier, according to a statement handed to reporters today
the capital, Nairobi. Net interest income, the money banks earn
from interest on loans, advanced 41 percent to 3.4 billion
shillings.  “All the bank’s subsidiaries were profitable in 2010,”
said Managing Director James Macharia, according to the
statement. “In particular, the bank’s maiden foreign
acquisition NIC Bank Tanzania Ltd. recorded a significant
turnaround in performance.”  The company announced plans to issue one bonus share for
every 10 held and pay a dividend of 50 cents per share,
unchanged from last year, the statement said.  “It was a good result, following the trend in the banking
sector,” Crispus Otieno Wasonga, a trader with Tsavo Securities
Ltd., said in an interview in Nairobi today. “There have been
low  interest rates  and banks’ Treasury departments are starting
to contribute real revenue. There’s been diversification.”  The stock rose as much as 4.9 percent to 54 shillings, the
highest since April 2008 and traded 1.9 percent higher at 52.5
shillings by 11:33 a.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
