  South Africa ’s 10-year bonds fell
for a fourth day, lifting yields to the highest in eight months
as surging  oil prices  overshadowed a report that showed producer
inflation moderated, growing at the slowest pace in April.  The 6.75 percent bond due March 2021, known by traders as
the R208, fell 45 cents to 86.804 rand as of 4:20 p.m. in
Johannesburg. That raised the yield by 7.5 basis points to 8.746
percent, the highest on a closing basis since July 6.  Brent oil jumped to a 30-month high, approaching $120 a
barrel as analysts estimated the political revolt in  Libya ,
which holds Africa’s biggest crude reserves, has led to a loss
of as much as two-thirds of the country’s oil output.  “A rapidly rising oil price raises the potential for
stagflation which is not particularly good news for either
equities or bonds,” Tradition Analytics researchers, led by
Quinten Bertenshaw in Johannesburg, wrote in a client note,
referring to a period of inflation and slow growth.  Producer prices increased an annual 5.5 percent in January,
down from 5.8 percent in December, according to information
released by the Pretoria-based Statistics South  Africa  today.
The median estimate of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
5.4 percent.  The consumer inflation rate rose to a six-month high of 3.7
percent in January from 3.5 percent the month before, the
government statistics office said in a Feb. 16 report. That’s
within the central bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range.
South African policy makers on Jan. 20 left their benchmark
interest rate at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent.  Interest Rate  “With consumer inflation still well contained and domestic
demand below potential,  interest rates  are expected to remain
unchanged throughout 2011,” Nedbank Ltd. economist  Carmen Altenkirch  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.
“However, the risk of an earlier rate hike has increased.”  Investors raised bets the central bank will raise its
interest rate in six months’ time by the most in two weeks.
Forward-rate agreements for three-month contracts due in six
months climbed 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.93
percent.  The rand gained 1 percent to 7.0595 per dollar, and
strengthened 0.5 percent to 9.7312 against the euro.  To contact the reporters on this story:
