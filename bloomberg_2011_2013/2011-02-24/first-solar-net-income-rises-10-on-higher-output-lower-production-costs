  First Solar Inc ., the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar modules, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 10 percent as panel demand climbed and manufacturing
costs declined. The shares fell as management reduced the top
end of its sales forecast for 2011.  Net income rose to $155.9 million, or $1.80 a share, from
$141.6 million, or $1.65, a year earlier, Tempe, Arizona-based
First Solar said today in a statement. The company was expected
to earn $1.76 a share, the average estimate of 30 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 4.9 percent to $609.8 million.  First Solar reduced its production costs 11 percent last
year to 75 cents a watt, one of the lowest in the industry, by
adding new manufacturing lines and increasing the output of each
panel. The modules now have an efficiency rating of 11.6
percent, up from 11.1 percent a year earlier.  The statement was released after the close of regular U.S.
trading. First Solar fell $5.68, or 3.4 percent, to $159 a share
as of 4:26 p.m. New York time in late trading on the Nasdaq
Stock Market. Before the late trading, they had gained 57
percent in the past year.  For the year, First Solar reduced the top end of its Dec.
14 sales guidance to $3.8 billion from $3.9 billion. Net income
will be in the range of $9.25 a share to $9.75 a share, up from
prior guidance of $8.75 to $9.50.  In December, First Solar sold its 290-megawatt Agua
Caliente project in  Arizona  to  NRG Energy Inc ., which plans to
invest as much as $800 million to complete the plant.  Since then, First Solar agreed to team with a Chinese
nuclear company to build the first, 30-megawatt phase of a
project in the city of Ordos in the  China ’s Inner Mongolian
desert. It also bought a maker of solar tracking systems called
RayTracker Inc., which increases electricity production by
tilting panels toward the sun as it crosses the sky.  To contact the reporter on this story:
