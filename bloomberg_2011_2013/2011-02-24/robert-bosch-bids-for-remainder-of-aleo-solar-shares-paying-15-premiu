  Aleo Solar AG  climbed above a
takeover bid in Frankfurt electronic trading, indicating
majority owner  Robert Bosch GmbH  may be asked to increase its
offer for the profitable solar-panel maker.  The stock surged as much as 23 percent to 23.50 euros after
Stuttgart-based Robert Bosch, the world’s largest automotive
supplier, offered 22 euros a share for the 18 percent of Aleo
Solar it doesn’t already own or control through share-purchase
agreements. The offer was detailed today in a regulatory filing.  Aleo Solar’s enterprise value, a measure of its takeover
price, is 2.9 times its earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, a lower multiple than its closest
German competitors such as Phoenix Solar AG, Solarworld AG and
Conergy AG, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
