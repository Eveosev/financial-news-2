(Corrects Murray’s team to Ottawa in second paragraph.)  The  Pittsburgh Penguins  acquired
forward Alexei Kovalev, a member of the  New York Rangers ’ 1994
Stanley Cup championship team, as they look to overcome
injuries.  Kovalev, who turned 38 today, was traded from the Ottawa
Senators for a conditional seventh-round pick in this year’s  National Hockey League  draft, Ottawa General Manager Bryan Murray said in a release. Kovalev spent parts of nine seasons
with the Rangers and played in Pittsburgh from 1998 to 2003.  A three-time All-Star, Kovalev has scored 426 goals and 591
assists in his 18-year NHL career. The Russian native was taken
by the Rangers with the No. 15 pick in the 1991 draft.  The Penguins (36-20-6), who won the Stanley Cup in 2009,
have the second-most points in the Eastern Conference with 10
players on injured reserve.  Sidney Crosby , the league’s most
valuable player in 2007, hasn’t played in two months because of
the aftereffects of a concussion, and Evgeni Malkin, the MVP of
the 2009 playoffs, is out for the season with torn knee
ligaments. The team is also battling injuries to defenseman
Brooks Orpik and forward Chris Kunitz.  The Senators are 20-31-9, in last place in the Eastern
Conference, and could miss the playoffs for the second time in
14 years. Kovalev had 14 goals and 13 assists in 54 games with
the Senators this year.  The NHL’s trade deadline is Feb. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
