  British American Tobacco Plc ,  Europe ’s largest cigarette maker, plans to resume buying back
shares after a two-year break caused by the recession.  The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes will seek to
repurchase 750 million pounds ($1.2 billion) of stock in 2011,
it said today. London-based BAT bought back shares from 2003 to
2008, before suspending the program in 2009.  BAT fell as much as 3.4 percent in London trading as some
analysts expressed disappointment at the scale of the buyback,
which is smaller than rivals such as  Philip Morris International
Inc .  David Hayes  at Nomura had estimated the company may
repurchase more than 1 billion pounds of stock. BAT’s free cash
flow increased by 23 percent to 3.24 billion pounds in 2010.  “The size of the buyback is less than we thought they
could do,” said Erik Bloomquist, an analyst at Berenberg Bank
in  London  with a “buy” rating on BAT. He estimates the buyback
will boost the company’s earnings per share about 2 percent.  BAT shares dropped as much as 81 pence to 2,332 pence and
were down 2.2 percent at 2,360 pence as of 11:31 a.m.  The buyback is the equivalent of a 1.6 percent stake based
on a market value of 47.2 billion pounds, Bloomberg calculations
show.  Philip Morris , the New York-based maker of Marlboro
cigarettes, said on Feb. 10 that it plans to buy back $5 billion
of stock in 2011, the equivalent of a 4.4 percent stake.  Acquisition Plans  “We like to keep a little bit of firepower available for
any tuck-under acquisitions that are out there, so we keep an
eye on that,” Chief Financial Officer Ben Stevens told analysts
at a meeting in London available via BAT’s website.  The maker of the Dunhill and Kent brands is studying
several smaller acquisitions, he said, adding that BAT doesn’t
expect any “major industry consolidation” in coming years.  Productora Tabacalera de Colombia Protabaco Ltda., a
Colombian cigarette maker, is a possible target for BAT,
according to Giulio Lombardi, an analyst at  Fitch Ratings .
Philip Morris on Jan. 5 abandoned an agreement to buy the
Colombian company for $452 million. Michael Prideaux, a
spokesman for BAT, declined to comment on Protabaco.  BAT said net income climbed to 2.88 billion pounds in 2010.
Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude reorganization costs,
trademark amortization and impairment, goodwill impairment and  capital gains , rose 15 percent to 175.7 pence, beating the 174.3
pence average estimate of 18 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Higher Prices  Revenue rose 4.8 percent to 14.88 billion pounds, less than
the average analyst estimate of 14.97 billion pounds.  BAT said it boosted sales growth by about 6 percentage
points through higher prices and more expensive brands to offset
a drop in consumption and higher government levies. Japan
increased taxes by a record 40 percent at the start of October,
while cigarette tax rose 29 percent in  Turkey  at the end of 2009
and 25 percent in  Australia  in April.  The global market for cigarettes excluding  China , which is
largely closed to foreign  tobacco companies , will probably
shrink by 2.5 percent in 2011, said Nicandro Durante, who will
become chief executive officer when Paul Adams retires at the
end of this month. BAT’s volumes should be a “little bit
better” than that as its brands gain market share, he said. BAT
also has “good momentum” in pricing this year, he said.  The operating margin rose to 33.5 percent in 2010 from 31.4
percent in 2009. BAT has a goal of reaching 35 percent by 2012
and will set a new target for its operating margin if it reaches
that objective early, CFO Stevens said.  Australia will probably introduce legislation requiring
cigarettes to be sold in packages without brand imagery and
logos in 2012, Adams said on the company’s web site. The move
would reduce competition in the country, where BAT has a 42
percent market share, he said.  BAT also said today that it plans to pay a final dividend
of 81 pence a share, raising the total dividend payment for the
year by 15 percent to 114.2 pence a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
