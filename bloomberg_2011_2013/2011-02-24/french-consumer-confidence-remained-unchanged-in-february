French  consumer confidence  was
unchanged in February amid concern about the strength of the
country’s economic recovery.  Sentiment remained at 85, the same level as in January,
which was the lowest since August, national statistics institute
Insee said in an e-mailed statement today from Paris. That
matched economists’ prediction, according to the median of 15
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jeffrey Donovan  at
