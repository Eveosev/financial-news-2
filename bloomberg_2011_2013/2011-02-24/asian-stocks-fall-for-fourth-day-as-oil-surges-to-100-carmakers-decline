Asian stocks fell, sending the
regional benchmark index to its longest losing streak in three
months, as oil surged above $100 a barrel for the first time in
two years amid escalating conflict in the Libya.    Air China Ltd . and  Qantas Airways Ltd . declined more than
3.3 percent on concern higher fuel costs will crimp profits.
Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of electronics, and Toyota
Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker, fell at least 1.5
percent after the yen appreciated, reducing the value of
exporters’ earnings. Tobu Railway Co., a bus and train operator,
slumped 12 percent after announcing a 93.2 billion yen ($1.1
billion) share sale.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.9 percent to 135.24
as of 7:31 p.m. in Tokyo, dropping for a fourth day in its
longest losing streak since November. About four shares fell for
each that rose in the measure, which climbed as much as 0.3
percent earlier.  “Share prices will have a tough time rebounding as long as
investors have their eyes on the risks stemming from the
uncertainty in the Middle East,” said Kenji Sekiguchi, general
manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $75 billion.  The Asia-Pacific gauge sank 1.8 percent on Feb. 22 as
Middle East rulers continued in their attempts to contain
uprisings that have overthrown leaders in Tunisia and Egypt and
spread to Bahrain, Yemen and Libya.    S&P 500  Futures  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average fell 1.2 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.8 percent.  South Korea ’s
Kospi Index lost 0.6 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
declined 1.3 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index
gained 0.6 percent. Singapore’s  Straits Times Index  fell 1
percent, taking its decline from a November peak to more than 10
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.4
percent today. The gauge declined 0.6 percent yesterday in  New
York , falling for a second day, amid the growing tension in the
Middle East and after Hewlett-Packard Co. reported forecasts
that trailed analysts’ estimates. The S&P 500 closed last week
at its highest level in 32 months.  Crude oil for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  climbed as much as 5.4 percent to $103.41 in Asian
trading, while Brent oil for April settlement reached as high as
$119.79 in  London .  Libya ’s uprising threatened to disrupt
exports from Africa’s third-biggest supplier and spread to other
Middle East oil producers.  Heavy gunfire broke out in Tripoli again yesterday, army
units defected and a former aide to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  said the revolt may topple the regime within days.  ‘Natural Reaction’  Air China, the world’s biggest carrier by market value,
slipped 4.9 percent to HK$7.04 in Hong Kong. Qantas, Australia’s
No. 1 airline, declined 3.3 percent to A$2.33 in Sydney.
Singapore Airlines Ltd. lost 1.4 percent to S$13.68.  “We’re having a natural reaction to the unrests with oil
going above $100,” Todd Martin,  Societe Generale ’s Asia equity
strategist, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in  Hong
Kong . “We could see GDP growth forecasts downgraded slightly.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.9 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Japanese exporters declined after the yen rose to as high
as 82.11 against the dollar today in Tokyo, compared with 82.64
at the close of stock trading. A stronger yen reduces the value
of exporters’ earnings when converted into the local currency.  Japan Exporters  Sony, the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation
gaming consoles, dropped 1.5 percent to 2,932 yen in Tokyo.
Canon Inc., the world’s No. 1 maker of cameras, lost 1 percent
to 3,905 yen. Toyota dropped 1.7 percent to 3,675 yen. Mazda
Motor Corp., the nation’s second-largest car exporter, sank 1.4
percent to 210.    Origin Energy Ltd ., which is set to become Australia’s
largest energy retailer after buying power assets, declined 3.5
percent to A$15.91 in Sydney. The company said first-half profit,
excluding one-time items, dropped 14 percent to A$304 million
($306 million) due to higher oil and gas exploration costs.  Tobu Railway slumped 12 percent to 400 yen in Tokyo, the
worst performer in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company
plans to sell as much as 93.2 billion yen of shares and use the
proceeds to repay debt and boost investment in a unit building
the world’s tallest tower in Tokyo.  Among stocks that advanced, TPK Holding Co., a supplier of
touch-panels to Apple Inc., surged 6.9 percent to a record
NT$777. The company plans to spend NT$20.3 billion ($682 million)
this year, compared with NT$9.4 billion in 2010, to boost
capacity, Chief Financial Officer Freddie Liu said at an
investors’ conference yesterday in Taipei.  “After TPK’s investor conference yesterday, investors are
more confident about the outlook for touch panel makers,” said
