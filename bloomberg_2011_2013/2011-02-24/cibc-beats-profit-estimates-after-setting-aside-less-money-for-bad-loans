Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the country’s first bank to report quarterly results, posted
earnings that topped analysts’ estimates after it set aside less
money for bad loans.  Net income for the first quarter ended Jan. 31 rose 23
percent to C$799 million ($812 million), or C$1.92 a share, from
C$652 million, or C$1.58, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank
said today. Revenue climbed 1.3 percent to C$3.1 billion.  Canadian lenders are benefiting from lower loan-losses as
the country’s economic recovery accelerates and  job creation 
rises.  Canada ’s six banks may report a 14 percent average
increase in profit before one-time items for the quarter, RBC
Capital Markets analyst Andre-Philippe Hardy said.  “This might be as close to a perfect set of earnings that
the banks are going to show,” BCV Asset Management Chief
Investment Officer Tony Demarin said in an interview before
earnings. “Canada is doing well.”  Canada’s fifth-biggest bank by assets said it earned C$1.97
a share excluding items, higher than the C$1.77-a-share average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  CIBC fell C$1.26 or 1.6 percent, to C$79.70 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange yesterday. The stock has risen 1.7 percent this
year, compared with a 4.9 percent rise for the 10-member S&P/TSX
Banks Index.  The bank set aside C$209 million for bad loans, down 42
percent from C$359 million a year earlier on lower write-offs in
cards and personal loans. CIBC’s trading income was C$139
million, down from C$379 million a year earlier on lower
structured credit trading.  Consumer Lending  Consumer banking profit rose 19 percent to C$627 million,
from C$527 million a year earlier, bolstered by a 14 percent
jump in wealth-management sales and higher revenue from personal
and business banking.  Canadian Imperial said it expects slower growth in demand
for mortgages and household credit, and modest improvements in
demand for business loans. Delinquencies will improve and
personal bankruptcies will fall, the lender said.  Canadian Imperial’s investment-banking profit fell to C$136
million, from C$184 million a year ago, after including a C$49
million after-tax loss from a structured credit business it’s
exiting. Underwriting and advisory fees jumped 13 percent to
C$162 million.  “It’s been a very strong period for equity markets, and
clearly both the investment banking and wealth management
operations of CIBC have benefited significantly,” said
Macquarie Capital Markets analyst Sumit Malhotra, who rates the
stock “outperform”.  Equity Sales    CIBC World Markets  should benefit from a “healthier pace
of issuance” for equities and bonds, the bank said. Takeovers
should also increase, boosting investment-banking fees.  CIBC, whose Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.3 percent as of
Jan. 31, said it expects to exceed the new requirements drawn up
by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  ahead of
implementation timelines.  Montreal-based  National Bank of Canada , the country’s
sixth-biggest bank, also reports today.  Bank of Montreal, the fourth-biggest Canadian lender,
reports March 1. Royal Bank of Canada, the largest lender, and
Toronto-Dominion Bank, the second-biggest bank, report on March
3. Bank of Nova Scotia reports results on March 8.  “We believe that CIBC’s earnings represent a solid start
to the Canadian banks’ first-quarter earnings and should buoy
valuations for the group,” Barclays Capital analyst  John Aiken 
said in a note.  (CIBC will hold an earnings conference call at 8 a.m. Toronto-
time at +1-416-695-6622 or +1-800-766-6630 or at www.cibc.com)  To contact the reporter on this story:
