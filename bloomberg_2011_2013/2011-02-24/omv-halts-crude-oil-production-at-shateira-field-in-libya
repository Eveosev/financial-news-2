  OMV AG  halted production at the
Shateira  oil field  in  Libya , the only one in the country it is
operator for, according to Sven Pusswald, a company spokesman.  The Vienna-based companyâ€™s combined production for Shateira
and fields operated by partner companies is 33,000 barrels of
oil a day, Pusswald said today in an e-mail, declining to
specify output at Shateira in the northeast of the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
