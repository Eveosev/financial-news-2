Gasoline futures extended their
gains after the U.S. Energy Department reported an unexpected
decline in inventories, the first drop in eight weeks.  Stockpiles slipped 2.8 million barrels to 238.3 million,
the report showed. The median forecast of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg News was for a gain of 850,000 barrels.  Gasoline demand rose 3.3 percent to 9.1 million barrels a
day, the second straight advance. The four-week average gained
1.4 percent to 8.75 million.  Gasoline for March delivery rose 4.43 cents, or 1.6 percent
to $2.7592 a gallon at 11:02 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price, which settled yesterday at $2.7149, was
$2.7462 before the report was released at 11 a.m. in  Washington ,
a day later than usual because of the U.S. Presidents Day
holiday Feb. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
