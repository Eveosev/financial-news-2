The yen was about 0.4 percent from
the strongest level in three weeks against the dollar and the
Swiss franc climbed to a record as an uprising in  Libya  sent oil
to a 29-month high, boosting demand for safer assets.  The yen and the franc headed for weekly gains against most
of their major counterparts as stocks and commodities dropped
worldwide. The dollar traded within 0.2 percent of a three-week
low against the euro before a report forecast to show U.S.
pending home sales declined in January.  “It’s a new scenario where the market is battling as
global economic growth is being thwarted by higher  oil prices ,
and that’s being reflected immediately in the  U.S. dollar ,”
said Kurt Magnus, executive director of currency sales at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in Sydney. “The Swiss franc and yen will continue
to do well, they are incredibly safe-haven currencies.”  The yen was at 81.93 per dollar as of 8:10 a.m. in Tokyo
from 81.89 in  New York  yesterday, when it touched 81.63, the
strongest since Feb. 4. It has gained 1.5 percent this week
against the dollar. The franc climbed to a record 92.28 centimes
per dollar before trading at 92.55 from 92.64 yesterday.  The dollar was at $1.3808 per euro from $1.3800, after
falling to $1.3821 yesterday, the lowest since Feb. 3. The
Japanese currency traded at 113.13 per euro from 113.02.  Libya, Oil  Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi , who has lost control of much of
his country’s oil-rich east, appealed on state television to
citizens to end violence as his forces stepped up a crackdown on
opponents and more than 100 people were reportedly shot dead.
Libya holds  Africa ’s largest crude oil reserves.  Crude for April delivery topped $103 per barrel in New York,
the highest level since September 2008, on concern supplies will
be disrupted. It later slipped to $97.28 a barrel.  The dollar was set for a 0.8 drop against the euro this
week after Treasury 10-year yields touched 3.41 percent, the
least since Feb. 2. Yields declined after U.S. Commerce
Department data showed sales of new homes fell 13 percent last
month to a 284,000 annual pace.  The index of U.S. pending home resales fell 2.5 percent in
January, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before the National Association of
Realtors reports the data on Feb. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
