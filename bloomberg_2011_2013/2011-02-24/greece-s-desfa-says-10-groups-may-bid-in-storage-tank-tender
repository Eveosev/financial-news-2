Desfa ,  Greece ’s natural gas grid
operator, said 10 groups are interested in bidding to construct
the third liquefied natural gas storage tank at its Revithousa
Island terminal, near Athens.  Companies and groups that have expressed interest include  J&P-Avax SA , Greece’s second-biggest construction company, and
Posco Engineering & Construction Co. in a joint venture with
Intracom Technical Steel & Construction SA. Aktor SA, the
building unit of Athens-based  Ellaktor SA , has also shown
interest with partner Saipem SpA of Italy, Desfa said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The 95,000 cubic-meter LNG storage facility, which is
budgeted at 130 million euros ($179 million), is scheduled for
completion in 2014, the Athens-based company said in the
statement.  Separately, Desfa said 2010 pretax profit rose 56 percent
on lower expenses.  The Athens-based company reported a pretax profit of 52.7
million euros. The company forecast a 22 percent increase in
pretax profit for this year, according to the statement.  The Greek government plans to sell a 65 percent holding in
Depa SA, Desfa’s parent company, while keeping control of the
gas grid network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
