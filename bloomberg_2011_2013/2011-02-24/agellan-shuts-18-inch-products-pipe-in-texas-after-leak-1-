  Magellan Midstream Partners LP  shut
an 18-inch refined-products pipeline that runs between  Texas
City ,  Texas , and Houston after a leak, Bruce Heine, a company
spokesman, said in a telephone interview.  The pipeline operator closed the line around 1 a.m.
immediately after a pressure drop, according to Heine. The
initial estimate is that 6,000 barrels of gasoline were spilled
near Texas City, according to Heine.  About 30 nearby were evacuated as a safety precaution and
an investigation into what caused the leak is under way, Heine
said. A local highway was shut down.  There have been no reported injuries, according to the
spokesman.  The spill entered a waterway where it has been contained
with booms, Heine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
