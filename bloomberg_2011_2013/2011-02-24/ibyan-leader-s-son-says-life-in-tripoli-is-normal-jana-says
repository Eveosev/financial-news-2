Life in Libya’s capital Tripoli as
well as central and southern parts of the country is "normal,"
state-run Jana news agency reported, citing Saif al-Islam Qaddafi, son of leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  “Stores and schools are open, people are working, banks
are open and life is normal,” the Tripoli-based news agency
cited him as saying.  Qaddafi, in power since 1969, is facing an unprecedented
rebellion seeking his ouster after popular uprisings brought the
reigns of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and  Egypt ’s  Hosni Mubarak  to end this year.  Qaddafi’s opponents have taken control of the eastern part
of the country and set up committees to help run and defend
their cities with the help of troops who defected to the
opposition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
