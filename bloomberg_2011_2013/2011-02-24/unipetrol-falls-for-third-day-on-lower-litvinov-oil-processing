  Unipetrol AS  fell to its lowest in
almost two weeks after the largest Czech oil refiner said it
will reduce the capacity at a refinery for about two weeks.  The stock fell 1.1 percent to 175 koruna at its 4:24 p.m.
close in Prague, its biggest drop since Feb. 11. The Czech
Republic’s benchmark PX Index of 15 companies, where Unipetrol
has a 3.3 percent weighting, dropped 0.3 percent to 1,238.  Unipetrol will reduce the processing capacity at its
Litvinov refinery due to technical problems with furnaces of a
hydrocracking unit, the Prague-based unit of  Poland ’s PKN Orlen
SA said in a statement yesterday after the stock market closed.  “The outage was not planned, and hence we are of the
opinion it is negative news for Unipetrol shares,” Josef Nemy,
an analyst at Komercni Banka AS, the Prague-based unit of
Societe Generale SA, wrote in a report to clients dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
