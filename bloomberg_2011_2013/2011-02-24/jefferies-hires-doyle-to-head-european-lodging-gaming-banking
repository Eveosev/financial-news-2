  Jefferies Group Inc ., the investment
bank that has been expanding its advisory and trading units,
hired Steffen Doyle as head of European lodging and gaming
investment-banking.  Doyle, who will be based in London, held the same position
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, New York-based Jefferies said
today in a statement. Jefferies provided financial advice on
$17.3 billion of deals in Europe in 2010, up from $4.52 billion
in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Announced
deals last year in European lodging and gambling industries
increased to $12.9 billion from $1.55 billion in 2009, according
to Bloomberg data.  “Lodging and gaming sectors of Europe are undergoing
significant changes and represent important areas for both
corporate and sponsor-based financing and merger-and-acquisition
activity over the next several years,” Benjamin Lorello,
Jefferies’s global head of investment banking and capital
markets, said in the statement.  Doyle, 34, received an undergraduate degree from the
University of  Notre Dame  in Indiana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
