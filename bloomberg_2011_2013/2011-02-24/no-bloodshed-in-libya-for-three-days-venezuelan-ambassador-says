Not a drop of blood has been shed in  Libya  in the last three days and the capital is “totally
calm,” according to the Venezuelan ambassador to Tripoli.  Afif Tajeldine said the media has been playing four-day-old
images and pretending events are occurring today, according to
an e-mailed statement sent by Venezuela’s Information Ministry.  “This is the third day in which not a single drop of blood
has been spilled in Libya,” Tajeldine said, according to the
statement.  Libya, holder of  Africa ’s largest oil reserves, became the
latest country to be rocked by protests ignited by the ouster of
Tunisia’s president last month. Italian Foreign Minister Franco
Frattini told parliament yesterday there are “credible" reports
that 1,000 people have been killed in Libya.  Human Rights Watch 
says a least 300 people have died in the 10 days since a
crackdown on protesters began.  To contact the reporter on this story:
