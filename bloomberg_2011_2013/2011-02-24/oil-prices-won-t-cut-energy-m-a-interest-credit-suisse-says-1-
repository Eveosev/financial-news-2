High oil prices won’t reduce global
appetite for energy assets as some countries are still seeking
to secure supplies, said Alberto Migliucci, head of mining and
oil and gas for  Southeast Asia  at Credit Suisse Group AG.  “For countries like South Korea, Japan, Singapore, net
importers of oil and gas, they haven’t got a choice,” he said
in an interview today in Seoul. For sellers, higher oil prices
may encourage them to sell assets that don’t form the bulk of
their business, according to Migliucci.  Oil for April delivery rose for a sixth day in  New York 
after reaching $100 a barrel as unrest in Libya threatened to
disrupt exports from the third-biggest African supplier. Futures
advanced to the highest in more than two years yesterday. Higher
crude prices will also encourage companies to invest more in
unconventional energy assets such as oil sands, Migliucci said.  Asian countries such as China, India and  South Korea  have
been leading energy acquisitions although he wouldn’t
underestimate U.S. companies, according to Migliucci.  To contact the reporter on this story:
