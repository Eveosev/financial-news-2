  Boeing Co ., the sole supplier of
aerial refueling tankers to the U.S. Air Force since 1948, beat
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. for a $35 billion
program to build 179 new tankers, the Pentagon said today.  It was the Chicago-based companyâ€™s third try at the
contract since Congress and the Air Force first proposed the
tanker replacement program in late 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
