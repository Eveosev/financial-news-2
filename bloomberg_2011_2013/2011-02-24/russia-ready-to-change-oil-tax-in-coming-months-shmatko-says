Russia  may reconsider proposed tax
rates for exports of crude oil and refined products after global
prices rose, Deputy Energy Minister Sergei Kudryashov told
reporters today in Moscow.  The  Finance Ministry  aims to introduce the so-called
“60-66” measure to lower crude export duties to 60 percent and
increase taxes on oil product exports to 66 percent in July,
Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said yesterday.  Government agencies have agreed “in principle” on the
proposal, Kudryashov said. The measure was created based on oil
at $75 a barrel and works until prices rise to $90 to $95 a
barrel, he said.  Urals, Russia’s benchmark crude export blend, has traded at
more than $100 a barrel since February, amid unrest in northern
 Africa  and the Middle East.  To contact the reporters on this story:
