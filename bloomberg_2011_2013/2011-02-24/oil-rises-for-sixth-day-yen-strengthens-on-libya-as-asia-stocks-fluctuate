Oil advanced for a sixth day in New
York after reaching $100 a barrel as Libya’s violent uprising
cut shipments from  Africa ’s third-biggest producer. The yen and
Swiss franc strengthened, while Asian stocks fluctuated.  Crude for April delivery rallied 1.3 percent in New York to
$99.39 a barrel at 10:20 a.m. in Tokyo. Brent reached a 30-month
high in  London . The yen and franc rose against all of their
major peers. The euro climbed toward a three-week high against
the dollar on concern faster inflation will spur higher interest
rates. Gold added 0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose
0.2 percent, erasing a 0.3 percent loss. Standard & Poor’s 500
Index futures added 0.2 percent following a two-day drop.  Loyalists of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi sought to crush
dissent in the capital, Tripoli, as his opponents tightened
control of eastern cities, with Total SA and OMV AG becoming the
latest energy producers to scale back their operations in the
North African nation. Data tomorrow may show German consumer
prices climbed this month, joining economic reports this week
that showed inflation is accelerating from  Singapore  to  Vietnam .  “We’re having a natural reaction to the unrests with oil
going above $100,” Todd Martin,  Societe Generale ’s Asia equity
strategist, said in a Bloomberg Television interview in  Hong
Kong . “We could see GDP growth forecasts downgraded slightly.”  Brent crude gained as much as 1.8 percent to $113 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, taking its
four-day rally to 10 percent. The April contract for West Texas
Intermediate oil rose as much as $4.58 yesterday to touch $100,
before settling at $98.10.  ‘Upside Risk’  The cuts in Libya create “significant upside risk” to  oil
prices  by reducing OPEC’s ability to absorb any further supply
disruptions in the Middle East, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Libya pumped 1.6 million barrels of oil a day in January,
enough to meet 8 percent of U.S. demand, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The fighting in  Libya , which holds Africa’s largest oil
reserves, is the most violent yet seen in six weeks of popular
uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa, which have
already unseated longtime rulers in Tunisia and Egypt. U.S.
President Barack Obama called for international pressure on
Qaddafi’s regime to end its attacks.  Copper for three-month delivery climbed 1.2 percent to
$9,534.5 a metric ton in London as metals extended their rebound
from the biggest drop in almost a month. Wheat gained for a
second day, rising 0.5 percent to $8.025 a bushel and rallying
from a two-month low yesterday. Gold for immediate delivery
gained 0.2 percent to $1,414.72 an ounce, within 1.2 percent of
its record $1,431.225 an ounce on Dec. 7.  ‘Reducing Risk’  The yen climbed to 82.23 per dollar from 82.51 in  New York ,
after touching 82.20, the strongest since Feb. 9, as violence in
Libya spurred demand for safe-haven currencies. The Swiss franc
climbed to a record high of 0.9276 per dollar before trading at
0.9288 from 0.9330 yesterday.  “The situation in the Mideast and Libya appears to be
deteriorating,” said Tsunemasa Tsukada, chief manager for
currencies and financial products in Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ
Trust & Banking Corp., a unit of Japan’s largest financial group
by market value. “Investors are probably reducing risk right
now, with money likely to go into the yen and the Swiss franc.”  The euro rose to $1.3772 from $1.3749 in New York, when it
reached $1.3787, the highest since Feb. 3, on speculation the  European Central Bank  will increase  interest rates  before the  Federal Reserve  to curb oil-driven inflation.  German EU-harmonized consumer prices gained 0.5 percent
after falling 0.5 percent in January, according to the median
estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
tomorrow’s data. ECB policy makers will make the decisions
necessary to maintain price stability, President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters yesterday in  Frankfurt .  Quicker Inflation  Malaysia’s ringgit weakened 0.2 percent to 3.0530 against
the dollar and the South Korean won slid 0.2 percent to 1,126.05.
Prices in  Malaysia  climbed at the fastest pace since mid-2009,
while Singapore’s inflation rate rose to a two-year high of 5.5
percent in January, reports yesterday showed. Vietnam’s consumer
prices gained the most in 24 months in February.  New Zealand’s dollar fell toward the weakest level in a
decade versus  Australia ’s on prospects the smaller nation’s
central bank will cut interest rates next month after an
earthquake likely dented growth. The so-called kiwi fell to
NZ$1.3459 per Aussie from NZ$1.3437 yesterday, when it dropped
to NZ$1.3476, the weakest since Dec. 23.  MSCI’s Asian index earlier fell as much as 0.3 percent,
after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous three sessions.
Qantas Airways Ltd. and AirAsia Bhd. lost more than 3 percent,
leading airlines lower. Energy producers gained, with  Cnooc Ltd .
and PetroChina Co. climbing 1.4 percent each.  The  S&P 500  posted yesterday its biggest two-day slump in
six months following the surge in oil prices. The slump in
stocks worldwide has wiped out more than $1.2 trillion since Feb.
18, when global market values reached the highest level since
June 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
