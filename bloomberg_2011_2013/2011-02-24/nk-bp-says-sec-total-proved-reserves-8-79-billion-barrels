TNK-BP,  BP Plc ’s Russian energy
venture with a group of billionaires, boosted total proved
reserves 2.4 percent last year because of exploration, enhanced
recovery and higher prices.  Proved reserves rose to 8.79 billion barrels of oil
equivalent under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or
SEC, standards, the Moscow-based producer said today in a
 statement . That compares with 8.59 billion barrels of oil
equivalent at the end of 2009, according to TNK-BP’s  website .  Increased oil recovery and exploration at fields in
Russia’s Uvat region and the Verkhnechonsk development in
eastern Siberia contributed to the growth, the company said. A
natural-gas transit agreement with OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s
pipeline operator, also helped increase reserves, TNK-BP said.  Russia’s Urals export blend for delivery in northwest  Europe  sold for $92.20 a barrel at the end of 2010, compared
with $76.56 a barrel on Dec. 31 of the previous year, according
to Bloomberg data.  Proved reserves under the Petroleum Resources Management
System rose 12 percent to 13.07 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, TNK-BP said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
