The euro may weaken against the
dollar as its recent advance on speculation the  European Central
Bank  will raise  interest rates  may be overdone, according to
Rabobank International.  The 17-nation common currency has strengthened 2.9 percent
versus the dollar this year, boosted by euro-region policy
makers’ comments that signal a readiness to increase interest
rates to contain inflation. The ECB will take the decisions
necessary to maintain  price stability , President Jean-Claude Trichet told reporters yesterday in  Frankfurt . The central bank
will hold a policy meeting on March 3.  “I’m a bit concerned that the euro has come a little bit
too far, too fast,” Jane Foley, a senior currency strategist at
Rabobank in London, said in an interview today. “The market
might be getting ahead of itself with respect to the degree of
hawkishness they can expect Trichet to impart next week.”  The euro strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.3776 as of
1:57 p.m. in  London  after reaching $1.3808, the highest since
Feb. 3.  “The ECB has stepped up its degree of hawkishness, but the
market has perhaps over compensated for that,” Foley said.
“There is a strong chance of a rate hike this year, but the
market shouldn’t get too ahead of itself, as some of these
inflationary pressures may prove to be temporary.”  If the currency pair fails to breach the $1.3862 high
reached on Feb. 2, the euro could slip back toward $1.3700 and
$1.3650, Foley said, adding she remains bullish on the shared
currency and forecasts it will strengthen toward $1.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
