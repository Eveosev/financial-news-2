  Kenya ’s shilling depreciated to the
weakest level in more than eight months against the dollar as
oil rallied to a 30-month high and businesses sought to buy
dollars to meet month-end obligations.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 1 percent to 82.59 per dollar, the weakest intraday
level since June 7, and traded 0.2 percent lower or 82 at 12:37
p.m. in  Nairobi.  Brent oil futures rose as much as 7.7 percent to $119.79 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, the
highest since Aug. 21, 2008, as Libya’s violent uprising reduced
supplies from Africa’s third-biggest producer. Loyalists of
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sought to crush dissent in the
capital of Tripoli as his opponents tightened control of eastern
cities and President  Barack Obama  condemned the regime’s
attacks.  “The shilling has weakened due to high demand for dollars
by businesses to settle their month-end invoices and with the
political crisis in the Arab world, the surge in oil prices will
pile more pressure on the local unit in the coming days,” Steve
Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CFC Stanbic Bank  Ltd., said in
a phone interview today. The shilling may “breach the
psychological 83 shillings to the dollar level as global  oil
prices  surge,” Lagat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
