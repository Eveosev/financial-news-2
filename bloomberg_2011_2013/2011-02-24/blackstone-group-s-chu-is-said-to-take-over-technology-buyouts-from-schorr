  Blackstone Group LP , the world’s
largest private equity firm, appointed Chinh Chu as head of its
technology practice in New York, replacing Paul “Chip” Schorr,
according to a person with knowledge of the matter.  Chu, a senior managing director who joined Blackstone in
1990, led the firm’s investments in Stiefel Laboratories Inc.,
Biomet Inc., Catalent Pharma Solutions Inc. and SunGard Data
Systems Inc., according to the firm’s website. He will work with
John Hodge, a senior managing director who heads Blackstone’s
technology practice in  Menlo Park , California, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the move isn’t public.  Schorr is now an adviser at Blackstone and is starting a
small-to-medium size buyout fund with seed financing from
Blackstone, according to another person with knowledge of the
situation. Schorr joined Blackstone in 2005 from  Citigroup Inc .
where he was a managing partner at the firm’s venture capital
practice in New York.  Schorr worked on the $17.6 billion leveraged buyout of
Freescale Semiconductor Inc. in 2006 by Blackstone and other
private equity firms. Freescale, the largest supplier of chips
to U.S. automakers, filed for an initial public offering of
$1.15 billion earlier this month to pay down $1.2 billion of
debt coming due in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
