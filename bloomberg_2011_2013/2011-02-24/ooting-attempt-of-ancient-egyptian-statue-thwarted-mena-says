Egyptian archaeologists prevented an
attempt to steal a 160-ton ancient statue of King Ramses II,  Egypt â€™s Middle East news agency reported.  Archaeologists and guards arrested the looters, who were
trying to damage and steal the statue that is part of an ancient
quarry in Aswan in Upper Egypt, MENA said, citing Minister of
State for Antiquities  Zahi Hawass  and other antiquities
officials.  The statue, made out of granite, has never been separated
from the quarry where it was sculpted, the news agency said,
citing Aswan antiquities official Mohammed El-Beily.  To contact the reporter on this story:
