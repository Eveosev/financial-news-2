Gopal Agrawal, a  fund manager  at
Mirae Asset Global Investments (India) Pvt. in Mumbai that has
$2.5 billion in investments, comments on the outlook for Indian
stocks and economy. He spoke in a telephone interview today.  “Oil price is a real problem. Apart from that, the
fundamental growth drivers are very much intact. Like strong
domestic consumption and a young population, which will drive
growth.  ‘‘On the consumption side I am very positive on India. The
only worry is that rising commodity prices may impact the
government’s finances and then  interest rates .’’  ‘‘The market may have a downside of about five to six
percent from here.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
