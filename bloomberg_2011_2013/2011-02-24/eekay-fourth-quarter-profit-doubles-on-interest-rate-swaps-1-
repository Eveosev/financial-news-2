  Teekay Corp ., owner of vessels that
haul oil and liquefied natural gas, reported fourth-quarter
profit more than doubled because of gains from interest-rate
swaps.  Net income increased to $85.9 million, or $1.16 a share,
from $29.8 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier, the Hamilton,
Bermuda-based company said in a statement. Revenue slid 4.9
percent to $497.3 million.  Excluding interest-rate swaps and other items, Teekay
reported an adjusted loss of $37.8 million, or 51 cents, versus
a loss of $33.3 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. On
that basis, the loss estimated by 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was 40 cents a share.  Teekay diversified its revenue sources by entering into
liquefied-natural-gas transportation and the offshore shuttle-
tanker market. Revenue from both sectors increased during the
quarter.  “We expect the incremental capex to keep going towards the
offshore business segment, where they are probably seeing the
best return,” said Michael Webber, senior analyst at  Wells
Fargo Securities LLC  in  New York , who has an “outperform”
rating on the stock. “They have a more diversified platform.”  Shares Up  Teekay declined $1.16, or 3.3 percent, to $34.03 at 12:45
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
are up 2.9 percent this year.  The average time-charter rate in the first quarter for
Teekay’s Suezmax tankers will be $27,047 a day, and the average
rate for Aframax will be $23,084, Teekay said in a conference
call.  Shipping revenue from the offshore shuttle-tanker segment
rose to $203.1 million from $190.9 million. Revenue from LNG
tankers rose to $96.8 million from $95.3 million.  Teekay’s Aframax vessels earned $12,659 a day in spot rates
during the quarter, down from $13,963 a year earlier. Suezmaxes
earned an average rate of $15,564 a day, down from $21,109.  Teekay operates 137 vessels, 36 of them Aframax, according
to the company’s  website . Aframaxes can move about 600,000
barrels of oil. Suezmaxes can carry about 1 million barrels.  Aframax spot rates averaged $11,725 a day in the fourth
quarter, up 10 percent from $10,663 a year ago, according to the  Baltic Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
