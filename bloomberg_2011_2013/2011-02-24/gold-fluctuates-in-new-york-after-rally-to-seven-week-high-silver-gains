Gold, little changed in  New York ,
may fall as the highest prices in seven weeks spur sales by some
investors. Silver rose for a fifth straight session.  The 14-day relative-strength index for gold topped 70 for
the second straight day, a signal to some traders that the price
is poised to fall. The metal touched $1,418.80 an ounce on the
Comex, the highest since Jan. 3, before paring gains. Before
today, gold climbed for seven straight sessions.  “Gold has had a nice uninterrupted run the past week, so
it’s not surprising to see a pause or some profit-taking,” said
Matt Zeman, a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group in  Chicago .
“There’s still a lot of geopolitical tension and unrest in the
Middle East, so gold is going to continue to work its way
higher.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 50 cents to $1,414.50
at 10:42 a.m. in New York, after rising as much as 0.3 percent
and dropping 0.4 percent. Before today, the price gained 28
percent in the past year, after touching a record $1,432.50 on
Dec. 7.  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.6 metric ton
to 2,015.39 tons yesterday, rebounding from the lowest level
since June 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December.
Silver ETP assets advanced 61.39 tons to 14,713.45 tons, the
highest level since Jan. 21, data from four providers show.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 2.1 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $33.325 an ounce on the Comex. On Feb. 22, the price
reached $34.315, the highest since March 1980. The commodity has
doubled in the past 12 months. The metal climbed to a record of
$50.35 in January 1980.  Palladium futures for June fell $3.30, or 0.4 percent, to
$773 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Platinum
futures for April delivery rose $9.50, or 0.5 percent, to
