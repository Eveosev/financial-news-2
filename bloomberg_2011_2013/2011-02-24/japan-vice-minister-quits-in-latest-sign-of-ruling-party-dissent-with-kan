A member of Japan’s government
resigned his post in the latest sign of divisions within the
 Democratic Party of Japan , adding to Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
struggles to pass the budget and avoid calling new elections.  Agriculture Minister Michihiko Kano today confirmed reports
that Vice Minister Kenko Matsuki tendered his resignation,
adding that he would seek to dissuade him. Matsuki is a
supporter of former DPJ leader  Ichiro Ozawa , who was suspended
by the party this week for the duration of his trial on charges
of violating campaign financing laws.  “It’s very regrettable,” Kano told reporters today. “I
cannot simply accept his intention, and want him to stay on.”  Ozawa’s punishment has provoked a backlash by some DPJ
lawmakers just as Kan seeks to raise the  sales tax  and promote
free trade to boost an economy hindered by the world’s largest
public debt. Kan has failed to persuade the opposition to
support financing bills for his 92.4 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion)
budget, increasing the possibility of a snap election.  Moody’s Investor Service two days ago lowered Japan’s debt
rating outlook on concern political gridlock will constrain
efforts to tackle debt that is set to exceed twice the size of
gross domestic product this year.  Standard & Poor’s  last month
cut its rating for Japan to the fourth-highest level, citing the
debt and the possibility the financing bills won’t be passed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
