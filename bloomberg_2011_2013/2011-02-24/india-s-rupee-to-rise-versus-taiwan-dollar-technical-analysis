  India ’s rupee may strengthen 1.7
percent against the  Taiwan dollar  in two to three days,
according to Forecast Singapore Pte, citing a technical
indicator.  A widening in the Bollinger band, which traders use to
judge support and resistance levels based on a currency’s moving
averages, suggests the rupee will extend its 3.7 percent rally
against the Taiwan dollar so far this month, said Winston Tang,
a Singapore-based technical analyst at Forecast. India’s
currency may gain to 0.6663 against the island’s dollar, he said.  “I see momentum on the upside,” Tang said. The Bollinger
band and “all the indicators point out the 0.666 level will be
reached in two to three days.”  The rupee strengthened 0.1 percent to 0.6552 against the
Taiwan dollar as of 9:40 a.m. in Mumbai and touched 0.6571, the
highest level since Dec. 27, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
