The Gulf Sheba, a supertanker
capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, is still
scheduled to load a cargo in Libya, according to its owner.  The vessel will pick up the crude from the port of Es
Sider, Per Wistoft, chief executive officer of Dubai-based  Gulf
Navigation Holding  PJSC, said by phone today. The carrier last
signaled its arrival date as Feb. 26, according to ship-
tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent crude oil futures jumped as much as 17 percent to
$119.79 a barrel this week, partly on speculation the conflict
will disrupt exports. The Seabravery picked up 600,000 barrels
of oil at the Zawia and Es Sider export facilities and sailed
at 1 a.m. local time yesterday, according to Dimitris Tsahalis,
chartering manager at Athens-based Thenamaris Ships Management
Inc., which owns the vessel.  Libya pumps 1.6 million barrels a day, exporting most of
its crude and fuel across the Mediterranean to  Europe ,
according to Bloomberg estimates. That’s about 1.8 percent of
world oil supply. It is Africa’s third-largest oil producer
after Nigeria and Angola.  Libya ’s 44.3 billion barrels of
proven oil reserves are the largest deposit in  Africa  and 3.3
percent of the global total, according to BP Plc.  Operations at Libyan oil ports are suspended, Al Arabiya
television reported Feb. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
