  NII Holdings Inc ., the wireless
carrier that uses the Nextel brand in Latin America, gained the
most in 10 months in Nasdaq Stock Market trading after reporting
record subscriber additions in the fourth quarter.  The mobile-phone company rose $2.98, or 7.7 percent, to
$41.84 at 4 p.m. New York time, the biggest gain since April 29.
The shares have dropped 6.3 percent this year.  NII is investing in third-generation networks in Latin
America to add high-speed Internet downloads to its walkie-
talkie services for business clients. NII added 436,000
customers across  Mexico ,  Brazil , Peru, Chile and  Argentina  in
the fourth quarter, bringing its total to 9 million.  Net income for the period ending Dec 31. advanced 65
percent to $98.6 million, or 57 cents a share, from $59.6
million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, NII said in a statement
today. Sales jumped 23 percent to $1.52 billion.  NII is already selling high-speed  Internet service  for
wireless computer modems in Peru, with plans to expand into
voice services on the new network, Tim Perrott, vice president
of investor relations, said in a phone interview. The company
plans to start offering service on its 3G networks in Mexico and
Brazil in the first half of 2012.  “What we’re seeing is more people being attracted to
Nextel as a business as our visibility has been increased with
more to offer customers,” Perrott said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
