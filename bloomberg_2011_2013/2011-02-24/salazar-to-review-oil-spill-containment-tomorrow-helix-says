U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar,
who oversees offshore oil drilling, will review  Helix Energy
Solutions Group Inc .’s spill containment system during a meeting
tomorrow, the company said.  “We look forward to briefing the secretary on the
capabilities of the system and the speed with which it can be
deployed,” Chief Executive Officer Owen Kratz of the Houston-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Helix and 20 companies are working on a system using
vessels and pipes to cap a ruptured well and collect oil in the
event of a blowout similar to  BP Plc ’s disaster in the Gulf of
Mexico last year.  Lack of containment resources has prevented the Obama
administration from permitting the resumption of exploration in
waters deeper than 500 feet (152 meters), Melissa Schwartz, an
Interior Department spokeswoman, said on Jan. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
