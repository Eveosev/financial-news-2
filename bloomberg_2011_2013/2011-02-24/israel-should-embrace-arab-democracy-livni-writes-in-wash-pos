  Israel  should embrace democratic
movements sweeping across Arab nations while helping ensure they
adhere to democratic principles, Tzipi Livni writes in the
Washington Post.  The democratic process in  Europe  in the 1930s was divorced
of commitment to democratic values with devastating
consequences,the former Israeli vice prime minister and minister
of foreign affairs says.  She adds that the Middle East has paid a similar price,
giving political legitimacy to movements such as Hamas in Gaza
and Hezbollah in Lebanon that donâ€™t adhere to democratic
principles and pose a danger to their neighbors and their own
people.  Recent developments in the Middle East have underscored the
need for adopting a universal code for participating in
democratic elections that would require political parties
running for office to accept a set of core democratic
principles, renounce violence and accept the pursuit of
objectives by peaceful means, commit to the rule of law, and
adhere to international agreements, Livni says.  Without such a code, the movement toward democracy risks
becoming subverted by those who want to use the democratic
process to advance anti-democratic agendas and by weak regimes
that feel compelled to appease extremists, Livni says.        Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
