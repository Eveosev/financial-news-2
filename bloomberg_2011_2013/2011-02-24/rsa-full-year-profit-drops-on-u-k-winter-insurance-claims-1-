  RSA Insurance Group Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest non-life insurer by market value, said full-year profit
fell 15 percent after higher-than-average winter weather-related
claims.  Net income declined to 355 million pounds ($575 million)
from 419 million pounds in 2009, the London-based company said
today in a statement. That matched the 353 million-pound
estimate of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “This is a strong top line and robust underwriting
performance in what has been an extremely tough year for the
industry,” Chief Executive Officer Andy Haste said in the
statement.  RSA said last month it would miss its underwriting profit
target for 2010 after the coldest December in Britain for 100
years caused a spike in auto and household claims. The cold snap
also caused higher-than-average losses in Scandinavia and
Ireland.  RSA’s operating profit was 636 million pounds, beating
guidance issued last month that profit would be between 600
million pounds and 630 million pounds. The company raised its
second-half dividend 7 percent to 5.7 pence a share.  The insurer’s combined ratio was 96.4 percent, missing its
95 percent target. The combined ratio measures claims and
expenses as a percentage of premiums. The lower the ratio is the
more profitable the insurer’s underwriting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
