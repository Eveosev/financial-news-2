The Zambia Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative wants parliament to enable the
government to “summon and scrutinize” the accounts of mining
companies, the state-owned  Times of Zambia  said today, citing a
statement from the organization.  The request comes after a study found discrepancies in
taxes paid by mining companies in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
