  Thailand ’s baht fell on concern
surging  oil prices  will slow the global economy, boosting demand
for the perceived safety of the dollar.  Crude prices reached $103.41 a barrel today, the highest
level since September 2008, as political turmoil mounted in
Libya, home to Africa’s largest oil reserves. Higher fuel costs
may affect the global economic recovery, Bank of Thailand
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said on Feb. 22. The MSCI Asia-
Pacific Index of regional shares fell for a fourth straight day.  “Rising oil prices may derail global economic growth and
make people risk averse,” said  Hideki Hayashi , a global
economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Investors seem to
prefer safer assets amid tensions in the Middle East, supporting
the  bond market .”  The baht dropped 0.2 percent to 30.66 per dollar as of 3:43
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may weaken to 30.80 by the end of this month, Hayashi
said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, added three basis points
to 2.47 percent.  The government’s five-year bonds rose for a second day. The
yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 fell half a
basis point to 3.475 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
