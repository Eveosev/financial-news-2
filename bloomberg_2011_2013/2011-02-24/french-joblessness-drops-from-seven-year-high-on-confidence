The number of jobseekers in  France 
fell from a seven-year high in January as improving confidence
among manufacturers prompted hiring.  The total of unemployed people actively looking for work
dropped by 19,300, or 0.7 percent, from the previous month, the
Labor and Finance ministries said in a joint statement in Paris
today. The total number of jobseekers was 2.703 million, down
from a revised 2.722 million in December.  Confidence among manufacturers rose to the highest in more
than three years in January as an accelerating global economy
buoyed exports, the Bank of France said on Feb. 8. Demand from
countries such as China and  India  are boosting output at
factories in  Europe .  “The vigorous recovery in industry should translate into
jobs and an improvement in the jobs outlook,” said Pierre- Olivier Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
