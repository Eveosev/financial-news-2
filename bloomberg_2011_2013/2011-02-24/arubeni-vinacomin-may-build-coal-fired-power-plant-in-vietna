  Marubeni Corp ., a Japanese trading
company, and Vietnam National Coal-Mineral Industries Group are
in talks about building a coal-fired power station in  Vietnam , a
Marubeni spokesman Yo Nomura said.  He declined to comment on a Nikkei newspaper report today
that said the station will cost $2 billion dollars and will be
the nationâ€™s biggest with capacity of 1,200 megawatts.  Marubeni and the Vietnamese state-owned company, known as
Vinacomin, will form a joint venture to build the power station
in Nghe An province, northern Vietnam, the Nikkei reported,
without citing anyone.  Marubeni will take a stake of between 35 and 45 percent,
the Nikkei said. Construction is scheduled to start next year
and be completed by 2016, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
