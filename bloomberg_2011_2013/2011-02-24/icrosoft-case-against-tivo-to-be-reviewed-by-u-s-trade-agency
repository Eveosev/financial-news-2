  Microsoft Corp .’s patent-
infringement claims against  TiVo Inc . will be investigated by a
U.S. trade agency that has the power to block imports of TiVo’s
television set-top boxes.  The U.S. International Trade Commission  said today  it would
investigate a complaint filed by Microsoft on Feb. 24.
Microsoft, the world’s biggest software maker, claims that set-
top boxes made by TiVo infringe four of its patents. TiVo, based
in Alviso,  California , makes the devices in Mexico, according to
the Microsoft complaint.  The case before the trade agency expands a legal battle
that began more than a year ago when Microsoft challenged TiVo
patents after TiVo sued  AT&T Inc ., a customer of Microsoft, over
the same patents. A separate lawsuit was filed by Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft claiming that TiVo infringed seven
Microsoft patents. The two sides are in talks to settle the
dispute, Microsoft said last month.  The four patents in the ITC case, which may be completed
within 15 months, relate to program schedules and selection,
controlling the interface, and a way to restrict use of the
digital-video recorder based on a program’s rating. Microsoft
said the technology is used in its Mediaroom software that runs
on competing set-top boxes including AT&T’s U-Verse service.  The case is In the Matter of Set-Top Boxes, and Hardware
and Software Components Thereof, 337-761, U.S. International
Trade Commission   Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
