South Africa’s Crop Estimates
Committee cut its estimate for the wheat harvest more than
traders anticipated after rain damaged crops.  Farmers may harvest 1.46 million metric tons this season,
3.1 percent less than the previous estimate of 1.51 million
tons, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by
phone from  Pretoria  today. The forecast lags behind the 1.5
million-ton median estimate of 10 traders Bloomberg surveyed.  South Africa, the continent’s fourth-largest wheat producer
after Morocco, Egypt and  Algeria , will probably harvest its
smallest crop in 19 years, according to the committee. The
country reaped 1.32 million tons in 1992, Scheepers said.  Wheat futures prices fell to a three-year low of 2,062 rand
a ton last year, reducing incentives to plant the grain.
Plantings fell 13 percent from a year earlier.  Some of the crops suffered “water damage,” reducing
yields, Scheepers said. Excessive rain in December and January
also damaged irrigation systems, prompting the committee to
lower its estimated wheat yield to 2.62 tons per hectare from
2.71 tons estimated previously. A hectare is 2.471 acres.  Grain SA, the country’s largest farmers’ body, estimated
this month that  South Africa  would probably have to import 1.5
million tons of wheat to meet local demand.  Wheat for delivery in May fell 1.7 percent to 3,154 rand a
ton by the noon close of trade on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
