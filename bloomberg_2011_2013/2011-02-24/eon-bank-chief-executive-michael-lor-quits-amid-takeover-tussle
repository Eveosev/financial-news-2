Michael Lor, chief executive officer
of  EON Bank Bhd. , has quit the Malaysian lender whose parent is
the target of a 5.06 billion-ringgit ($1.7 billion) takeover,
according to a stock exchange filing today.  His resignation was accepted and will take immediate effect,  EON Capital Bhd ., owner of the bank, said in a statement. Lor,
46, couldn’t be immediately reached for comment at his office or
by mobile phone when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  EON Capital is the subject of a planned buyout by
billionaire Quek Leng Chan’s  Hong Leong Bank Bhd . Shareholders
voted in favor of the sale last September, although completion
is pending lawsuits filed by Primus Pacific Partners Ltd., a
Hong Kong-based investment fund with a 20.2 percent stake, which
is seeking to block the sale.  Lor joined EON Bank as head of group consumer banking in
2008 before being appointed chief executive in October 2009. He
told Bloomberg in an interview in February 2010 that EON was in
no hurry to be sold or find a merger partner as the bank was
“very well capitalized.”  An EON takeover would help Hong Leong create the Southeast
Asian nation’s fourth-biggest banking group with combined assets
of about 121 billion ringgit.  Mohzani Abdul Wahab and Zaha Rina Zahari, two of the bank’s
directors, will take on Lor’s responsibilities while the search
for a successor takes place, EON said. They will be assisted by
Peter Chow Ying Choon, the statement said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
