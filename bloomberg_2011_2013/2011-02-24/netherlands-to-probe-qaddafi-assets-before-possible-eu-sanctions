Dutch Foreign Minister Uri Rosenthal
requested a government inquiry into whether Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has assets in the Netherlands before possible
European Union sanctions, a ministry spokesman who declined to
be identified said today.  Rosenthal yesterday told parliament he supports EU
sanctions against Qaddafi after the evacuation of foreigners
from  Libya  is mostly completed. The EU is looking into sanctions
such as freezing the assets of Libyan authorities responsible
for violence against peaceful protesters, he said.  Dutch newspaper  De Volkskrant  yesterday reported about
Libyan state-owned assets administered from the Netherlands,
including oil company Tamoil and Verenex Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
