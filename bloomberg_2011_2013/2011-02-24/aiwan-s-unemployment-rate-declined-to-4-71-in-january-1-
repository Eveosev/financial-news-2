  Taiwan ’s unemployment rate declined
to a 27-month low in January as the island’s economic expansion
spurs hiring and adds to the central bank’s case to raise
borrowing costs further next month.  The seasonally adjusted rate fell to 4.71 percent from a
revised 4.72 percent in December, the statistics bureau said in
Taipei today. That’s the lowest since October 2008’s 4.4 percent
based on revised data, the bureau said. The median estimate of
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a jobless rate
of 4.68 percent.  Overseas shipments propelled economic growth to a 24-year
high in 2010, encouraging companies to hire and stoking growth
in wages. The central bank may add to last year’s three
interest-rate increases, with quickening inflation from  China  to  South Korea  set to spur higher borrowing costs and currency
gains across Asia.  “Demand for labor, mostly temporary jobs, is high ahead of
the Lunar New Year holidays,” Kevin Wang, an economist at Grand
Cathay Services Corp. in Taipei, said before the release. “The
jobs market will likely continue to improve as the economy
extends its recovery.” He expects the central bank to raise
borrowing costs by 0.125 percentage point to 1.75 percent at its
next scheduled quarterly policy meeting in March.  Today’s figures were released after the close of trading on
the stock exchange. The Taiex index ended up 0.1 percent. The
local dollar declined 0.6 percent to NT$29.760 against its U.S.
counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc., and has risen 7.4
percent in the past six months, the most in  Asia .  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of the island’s
economy, jumped 34.8 percent to a record $274.6 billion in 2010,
the  finance ministry  said last month. Industrial production rose
for a 17th straight month in January, a report showed yesterday.  The number of unemployed people fell to 524,000 in January
from a revised 525,000 in December, on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Without adjusting for seasonal factors, the jobless rate
declined to 4.64 percent from 4.67 percent in December.  The Central Bank of the  Republic of China  (Taiwan) raised
its benchmark interest rate by 0.125 percentage point in each of
June, September and December last year from a record low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
