  Gap Inc ., the largest U.S. apparel
chain, posted a 3.7 percent gain in fourth-quarter profit,
beating analysts’ estimates, as international sales spurted.  Net income rose to $365 million, or 60 cents a share, in
the three months ended Jan. 29, from $352 million, or 51 cents,
a year earlier, the San Francisco-based retailer said today in a
statement. Analysts predicted 57 cents, the average of 25
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  International revenue jumped 12 percent in the quarter
after Chief Executive Officer Glenn Murphy added stores overseas
and closed them in  North America . Gap said today that it plans
to open 50 company-owned stores this year internationally,
including in China and  Italy . The retailer has 353 owned stores
outside the U.S., out of a total 3,068.  Gap rose 2.3 percent to $23 at 4:31 p.m. after regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At the session’s close,
the shares had gained 1.6 percent this year.  The company said fourth-quarter revenue climbed 3 percent
to $4.36 billion. International sales increased 12 percent to
$620 million. Sales at stores open at least a year were little
changed. In North America,  Banana Republic  and  Old Navy  each
posted a 1 percent gain, while the Gap brand had a 2 percent
decline.  Gap also said its board approved a $2 billion share
repurchase plan and raised its annual dividend by 13 percent to
45 cents in 2011.  The company forecast full-year net income of $1.88 to $1.93
a share for the fiscal year that began last month. Analysts on
average had projected $1.93.  To contact the reporter on this story:
