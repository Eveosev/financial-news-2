  Bank of New York Mellon Corp . calls
jumped after a single trade with a strike price 13 percent above
today’s close.  A total of 9,800 April $34 calls to buy stock of the
largest custody bank traded for 12 cents each at 2:46 p.m. in
New York, all at the ask price, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  More than 11,200 calls changed hands today, four times the
four-week average and six times the number of puts to sell. The
most-traded contracts, the April $34 calls, accounted for almost
nine-tenths of all call volume.  New York-based BNY Mellon dropped 0.9 percent to $30.13.
The bank advanced 5.2 percent in the past year, versus a 13
percent gain for a gauge of financial companies in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index.  BNY Mellon’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days rose to
27.03 from 26.14 yesterday.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
