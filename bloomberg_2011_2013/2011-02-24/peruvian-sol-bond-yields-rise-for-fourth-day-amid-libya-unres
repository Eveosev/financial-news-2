  Peru ’s sol bonds fell, pushing
yields higher for a fourth day, as the uprising in Libya sapped
demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 rose 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 6.2 percent at 4:26 p.m. New York time, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The bond’s price fell 0.75
centimo to 111.64 centimos per sol.  “Investors continue to shift their portfolios, moving out
of emerging markets,” said Hugo Perea, chief economist at BBVA
Banco Continental in Lima.  Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi , who has lost control of much of
his country’s oil-rich east, made an appeal on state television
for citizens to end violence as his forces stepped up a
crackdown on opponents and more than 100 people were reportedly
shot dead.  The sol closed little changed at 2.7858 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7870 yesterday.  The central bank didn’t buy dollars today in the foreign
exchange market, it said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
