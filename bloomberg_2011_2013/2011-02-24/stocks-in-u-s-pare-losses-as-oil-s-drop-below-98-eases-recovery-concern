U.S. stocks pared losses as oil
retreated after climbing above $100 a barrel, easing concern
that surging energy prices will hurt the economic recovery.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent to
1,301.64 after dropping 1 percent earlier. Crude oil for April
delivery lost 0.7 percent to $97.41, retreating from an earlier
high of $103.41. Treasuries trimmed gains, with the 10-year
yield down four basis points to 3.43 percent after sinking as
much as seven basis points.  U.S. stocks fell for a second day yesterday, dragging
benchmark indexes to the biggest two-day drop in six months, as
oil surged amid growing tensions in the Middle East and Hewlett-
Packard Co.’s forecasts trailed estimates. The  S&P 500  had risen
4 percent in 2011 through yesterday as reports showed an
improving economy and earnings beat analysts’ estimates for the
eighth straight quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
