Investors should buy bullish options
on an exchange-traded fund tracking oil because unrest may
spread beyond  Libya  and options prices suggest crude will keep
gaining,  Credit Suisse Group AG  said.  Equity derivatives strategists Ed Tom and Terry Wilson
recommended buying a March $41 call while selling a March $46
call on the U.S. Oil Fund. The ETF tracking West Texas
Intermediate crude oil fell 2.1 percent to $38.97 as of 4 p.m.
in New York, and earlier reached the highest intraday level
since May.  “Markets may be underpricing the geopolitical contagion
risks stemming from the current wave of protests,” the New
York-based strategists wrote. “Not only could the situation
worsen in Libya, but the real threat is the possibility of civil
unrest spreading from Bahrain to its neighbor  Saudi Arabia ,
which is currently the world’s largest oil exporter.”  Crude has surged to a two-year high amid growing tensions
in the Middle East and Libya, Africa’s third-biggest oil-
producing country. Opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi
consolidated control over the oil-rich east while he clamped
down on Tripoli, using tanks to block highways and security
forces to attack residents, witnesses said.  Crude oil for April delivery declined 82 cents, or 0.8
percent, to settle at $97.28 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract earlier reached $103.41, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008. Futures are up 22 percent
from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
