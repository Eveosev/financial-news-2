Coffee prices, which have doubled in
the past year, may rally another 48 percent to the highest since
at least 1972 as demand outpaces supply, according to Hackett
Financial Advisors Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that coffee has surged as demand
grew in countries that ship the commodity, including  Brazil , the
world’s biggest producer. Prices may climb to $4 a pound in 12
to 18 months as demand gains 3 percent in the exporting
countries, eroding dwindling stockpiles, said  Shawn Hackett ,
president of Hackett Financial.  “The current demand cannot be satisfied,” Hackett said by
telephone from  Boynton Beach ,  Florida . “The price will continue
to go up until people who drink coffee drink less.”  Rising consumption in emerging economies will be the main
driver for coffee prices, Hackett said. Accelerating economic
growth boosted demand in exporting nations by 23 percent since
Sept. 30, 2005, according to data from the  International Coffee
Organization . In that time, stockpiles in the nations have
plunged 65 percent, the group said.  Yesterday, arabica coffee for May delivery fell 1.8 percent
to $2.6945 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The price
touched $2.784 on Feb. 22, the highest since May 1997. The
commodity touched $3.375 in April 1977, the highest according to
Bloomberg data that starts in 1972.  ICO data is based on an average global crop year that runs
from October through September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
