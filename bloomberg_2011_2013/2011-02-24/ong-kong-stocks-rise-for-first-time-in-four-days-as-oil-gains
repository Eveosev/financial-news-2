biggest African supplier. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., the
cityâ€™s largest carrier, lost 0.7 percent. Cosco Pacific Ltd., a
shipping container company, dropped 1.5 percent to lead declines

10,863.95. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of H shares of
Chinese companies increased 0.8 percent to 12,343.06.  The  Hang Seng  has fallen 0.6 percent this year through
