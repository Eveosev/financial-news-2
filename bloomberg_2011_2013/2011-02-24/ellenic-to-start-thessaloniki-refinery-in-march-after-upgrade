  Hellenic Petroleum SA ,  Greece ’s
largest refiner, plans to start its Thessaloniki refinery in
March following a shutdown for planned maintenance and to tie-in
new processing units.  This year’s “planned production reflects nine months of
the new refinery yields and economics,” Athens-based Hellenic
said today in a  presentation  on its website. The plant, which
can process 72,000 barrels of oil a day, was scheduled to shut
in mid-January for about a month, the company said in August.  Hellenic is also upgrading its 100,000 barrel-a-day
Elefsina refinery, with more than 80 percent complete, according
to the presentation. Last year, the plant ran at reduced rates
because of “lower benchmark topping margins,” the presentation
showed. Production decreased 39 percent to 1.68 million metric
tons compared with a year earlier.  “The refining industry remains challenged because of slow
economic recovery,” Chief Executive Officer John Costopoulos
said today in a playback of a conference call discussing 2010
earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
