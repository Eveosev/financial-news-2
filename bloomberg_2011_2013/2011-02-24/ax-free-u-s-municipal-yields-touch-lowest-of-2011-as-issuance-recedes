Yields on top-rated tax-exempt
municipal bonds touched the lowest level this year as a decrease
in new issues helped push down borrowing costs.  Rates on 10-year AAA munis have fallen about 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, this week to 3.13 percent, and
reached the lowest since Dec. 31, according to a Bloomberg
Valuation index. Yields on top-rated seven-year debt are down 7
basis points to about 2.45 percent, also this year’s low, BVAL
indexes show.  “‘We’re having a nice comeback, spurred by low supply,”
said John Flahive, a Boston-based director of fixed income for
BNY Mellon Wealth Management, who oversees about $20 billion.
“We’re on a runway to be significantly below what expectations
were” in terms of supply, he said.  Municipal issuers sold about $11.9 billion in fixed-rate
bonds in January, the smallest monthly amount since at least
February 2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. States
and municipalities are slated to offer about $5.6 billion in
debt this week, about 29 percent less than the same period last
year, Bloomberg data show.  States and local governments sold about $129 billion in
fixed-rated debt last quarter, the most in a three-month period
since at least 2003, Bloomberg data show. The flurry resulted in
part from the Dec. 31 end of the Build America Bonds program,
which provided a 35 percent federal subsidy on interest costs.  Issuers moved up sales to beat the deadline. More than $187
billion in Build Americas were sold through the program, created
by President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
