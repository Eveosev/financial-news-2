The Philippine peso and bonds fell
on concern rising  oil prices  will stoke inflation in a nation
that relies on the  Persian Gulf  for overseas jobs and income.  The commodity climbed to $100 a barrel yesterday in  New
York  for the first time since October 2008 as governments
evacuated thousands of expatriates from Libya,  Africa ’s third-
biggest crude supplier. More than 1.7 million Filipinos are in
the Middle East and 26,000 of them are in Libya, Foreign Affairs
Undersecretary Esteban Conejos said yesterday.  “The lingering tension in Libya is pushing oil prices up
in the global and domestic markets,” said Manu Goseco,
treasurer at East West Bank Corp. in Manila. “It tends to
affect inflation, although the impact for us could be minimal.”  The peso dropped 0.3 percent to 43.700 per dollar at 10:55
a.m. in  Manila . It earlier touched 43.76, the weakest level
since Feb. 14. The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January
2014 rose 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 5.4
percent, according to Tradition Financial Services.  Inflation should stay within target until 2013 and the
political situation in the Middle East isn’t expected to have
“any serious impact on the peso and remittances at this
point,” central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said
yesterday.  An inflation rate of 3.5 percent in January was the highest
in four months. The statistics office will report the February
data on March 4. Money sent home by  Filipinos overseas  climbed
to a record $18.8 billion in 2010, more than 10 percent of the
$161 billion economy.  The  Philippines  may sell 100 billion pesos ($2.3 billion)
of bonds targeted at individual investors in an offering that
ends March 1, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said yesterday.  To contact the reporter for this story:
