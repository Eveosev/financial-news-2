The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a slower pace in January
than the previous month as a surge in the value of the rand in
the second half of last year helped curb import costs.  Producer prices increased an annual 5.5 percent after
gaining 5.8 percent in December, Pretoria-based  Statistics South
Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 5.4 percent. Prices rose
1.1 percent in the month.  The rand climbed 16.7 percent against the dollar in the six
months through December, before weakening 7.6 percent in
January. A stronger rand has helped offset rising oil prices and
keep consumer-price inflation inside the central bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent target range. That enabled Governor Gill Marcus to leave the benchmark interest rate at a 30-year low of
5.5 percent on Jan. 20, while warning that renewed consumer
spending and rising oil and food costs may push up inflation.  “The disinflationary impact of the strong rand is expected
to be reflected in the PPI data in January,” Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest lender, said in a
note to clients before the release of today’s data. “However,
in the months ahead, the producer price pressures are likely to
rise due to higher commodity prices.”  The consumer inflation rate rose to a six-month high of 3.7
percent in January from 3.5 percent the month before, the
government statistics office said in a Feb. 16 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
