South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  holds his post-Budget breakfast briefing in  Cape
Town . Gordhan, 61, yesterday unexpectedly postponed plans to
narrow the  budget deficit  to ramp up spending to create jobs.  The cost of goods leaving South African factories rose at a
slower pace in January than the previous month, according to the
median estimate of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Producer
prices increased an annual 5.4 percent last month compared with
5.8 percent in December, according to the estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
