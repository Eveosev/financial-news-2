Swiss manufacturers are facing
“massive” pressure on earnings as the franc’s strength makes
exports more expensive, the Swissmem association said.  The group said a survey among its members, including  ABB
Ltd .,  Geberit AG  and  Georg Fischer AG , found 57 percent of
companies were “severely” hurt by the currency’s ascent
against the euro, Zurich-based Swissmem said in a faxed
statement today. Thirty-three percent of companies said they
were “moderately” affected.  New orders at Swissmem companies ranging from engineering
to metals businesses advanced 30 percent in the fourth quarter
from the year earlier, while sales gained 5.9 percent, the
association said. The franc has appreciated 6.3 percent against
the euro in the past four months.  “At first sight, one might be tempted to think all is
well,” Swissmem said. “However, the strong franc is exerting
massive pressure on margins and pushing many companies back into
an operating loss.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
