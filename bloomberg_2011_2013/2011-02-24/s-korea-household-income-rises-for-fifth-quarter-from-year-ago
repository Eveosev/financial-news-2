South Korean household earnings rose
for a fifth straight quarter from a year earlier as the nation
extended its economic recovery.  Average monthly income at households gained 2.4 percent to
3.62 million won ($3,217) in the three months ended Dec. 31 from
the same period in 2009, Statistics  Korea  said in a report today.  The economy grew at the fastest pace since 2002 last year,
stoking price pressures. Inflation has breached the Bank of
Korea’s 4 percent ceiling and Governor Kim Choong Soo has
indicated a pause in interest-rate increases this month may only
be temporary.  Income growth is slowing after expanding 6.1 percent in the
third quarter and 7.6 percent in the second quarter, today’s
report showed.  Households’ monthly spending increased 4.2 percent to 2.31
million won last quarter from the same period a year earlier,
after gaining 5.4 percent in the three months through September.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a
quarter of a percentage point in each of July, November and
January to 2.75 percent from a record low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
