  American Airlines ’ largest union is
taking the lead in creating a labor coalition among  Oneworld 
alliance carriers in hopes of building global strength for
contract  negotiations .  The  Transport Workers Union  expects the coalition to
increase pressure on  AMR Corp .’s American to reach an agreement
in talks that began in November 2007. Employees at carriers
including British Airways and Japan Airlines Corp. may picket
American terminals in their countries in support of the union,
the group said today at a news conference.  “I expect to see real movement” in negotiations with
American, said Garry Drummond, international vice president of
the union’s air transport division. “A global labor council is
different. It can make a huge difference.”  American declined to comment on the labor coalition. Unions
from some of the 12 Oneworld airlines will meet in Washington in
April to develop long-term plans.  The One World of Labor Council also will focus on ways the
unions can help boost revenue for Oneworld airlines, Bob
Zimmerman, president of Transport Workers Local 565, said at
union offices in Hurst,  Texas , near American’s headquarters in  Fort Worth .  The union, which represents 22,000 American employees, is
working with the carrier to secure maintenance and ground-
handling contracts from Oneworld airlines that fly into the U.S.
carrier’s domestic hubs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
