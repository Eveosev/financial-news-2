  Vietnam ’s Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung urged state-owned companies to sell dollars to the central
bank to help control the dong exchange rate, after a record
devaluation this month.  “How can you hoard U.S. dollars when we are in this
difficult situation?” he said, referring to state-owned
companies, in his closing remarks at a meeting with ministries
in Hanoi today.  The State Bank of Vietnam  devalued the dong for the fourth
time in 15 months on Feb. 11 to curb a trade deficit that
reached $12.4 billion last year and narrow the gap between
official and black-market exchange rates. The dong slid 7
percent to a record low against the dollar after the
devaluation, prompting companies to hoard the greenback.  The currency dropped 0.3 percent to an eight-day low of
20,890 per dollar as of 3 p.m. local time today, according to
prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That compared with the
rate of about 22,000 at gold shops in  Ho Chi Minh City ,
according to an information service run by state-owned Vietnam
Posts & Telecommunications.  Dung requested the central bank and the Ministry of Finance
“to mobilize all sources” to control the dong’s exchange rate
in the black market. “We can’t afford to let the black market’s
exchange rate control our economy.”  Vietnam’s companies started selling dollars to the market
after information that the government will impose a series of
“strong measures” to cut the foreign currency “fever,” Tuoi
Tre newspaper reported today, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
