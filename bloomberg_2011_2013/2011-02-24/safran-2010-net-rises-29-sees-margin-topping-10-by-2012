  Safran SA ,  Europe ’s second-largest
maker of aircraft engines, said profit rose 29 percent last year
as it benefited from growth in defense. The company forecast its
operating margin would top 10 percent by 2012.  The Paris-based company, which builds commercial aircraft
engines jointly with  General Electric Co . for Airbus SAS A320
and  Boeing Co . 737 models, reported adjusted net income of 508
million euros ($700 million), or 1.27 euros a share, compared
with a restated 395 million euros, or 99 cents, in 2009. Revenue
rose 3 percent to 10.8 billion euros.  Sales were buoyed by 17 percent growth in Safran’s defense
businesses, particularly optronics, which included long-range,
infrared goggles for the French military and export markets, the
company said.  “The year 2010 was more than a time of transition for
Safran,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Herteman said in an
e-mailed statement. “It marked our emergence from a challenging
period and the group is again on the path for development.”  Safran said it will ask shareholders to approve an increase
in the dividend to 50 cents a share, from 38 cents, at the
company’s annual meeting on April 21.  The company predicted next year’s sales will increase by at
least 5 percent, with operating profit rising at least 20
percent. Those forecasts don’t take into account any
contributions from the planned purchases of L-1 Identity
Solutions Inc. and SNPE Materiaux Energetiques.  Growth in Demand  The 2011 forecast includes 10 percent to 15 percent growth
in demand for commercial aerospace services, strong recovery in
demand for aircraft equipment, higher research-and-development
spending, and “prudent” assumptions in the short term on
deliveries of the Airbus A380, where Safran provides cabling,
and Boeing’s 787, for which Safran provides the landing gear.  The company said its operating profit margin -- 8.2 percent
in 2010 -- can rise to more than 10 percent by 2012 with more
favorable exchange rates, potential growth in services for
aerospace products, development of security services, and the
global recovery in demand for  aircraft engines  and equipment.  Results are adjusted for the effect of re-evaluating
currency hedges and purchase-price allocations, as well as
accounting for assets and liabilities in acquisitions. Safran
said 2009 results were restated to reflect changes in definition
and presentation of adjusted data as of June 30, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
