  American International Group Inc .,
the insurer selling assets to repay a U.S. bailout, will weigh
raising funds from International Lease Finance Corp., the
company’s plane-leasing unit.  “To the extent that we ultimately find a way to monetize
that asset for the benefit of ILFC, its customers, and for AIG,
we would consider that,” Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  said in  remarks  posted late yesterday on the website
of the New York-based insurer. “While it’s not core, the
company has been a very good value investment for us. ILFC
management is managing it for the long haul.”  AIG has raised more than $50 billion selling assets
including non-U.S. life insurers, a consumer lender and
equipment guarantor. The insurer said in a Nov. 19 letter to the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it wasn’t
attempting to sell the unit “at the present time.”  Chairman  Steve Miller  didn’t outline a timetable for a sale
in remarks on AIG’s website.  “ILFC is a good company, and we would expect it to have
great value and monetize it at some point, but not now,” he
said.  ILFC posted an operating loss of $606 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with profit of $344 million a year earlier as
the Los Angeles-based unit wrote down the value of its fleet,
AIG said yesterday as it reported 2010 results. ILFC has
committed to buy 115 new plans at an aggregate price of $13.5
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
