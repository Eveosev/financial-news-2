  California  Governor  Jerry Brown 
pledged to cut $25 billion from an $85 billion spending plan to
close the state’s budget gap if lawmakers block a special
election to allow voters to extend temporary tax increases.  If lawmakers don’t approve the special election, Brown said
he’d hold up the budget for as long as it takes to eliminate the
$25 billion deficit through spending cuts.  “It’s very fundamental, whether you vote the taxes or you
vote the cuts,” said Brown, a 72-year-old Democrat who was
governor from 1975 to 1983. He spoke today at a joint
legislative budget conference committee hearing in Sacramento.  Brown has pledged to fix the financial strains that have
left California with the biggest deficit of all U.S. states, and
the lowest  credit rating . With an economy bigger than  Russia ’s,
California has coped with $100 billion of budget gaps in the
past three years amid the global recession.  He has proposed an $84.6 billion general-fund budget that
trims $12.5 billion with spending reductions and requires
lawmakers to call a special election in June for voter
permission to extend almost $10 billion of higher vehicle fees,
sales taxes and income-tax rates to avoid even deeper cuts.  Brown’s plan deals with an $8.2 billion deficit that has
emerged in the current budget, as well as a $17.2 billion hole,
about 20 percent of spending, in the fiscal year that begins
July 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
