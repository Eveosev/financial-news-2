Sahaviriya Steel Industries Public
Co.,  Thailand ’s largest steel producer, is considering a U.K.
listing after agreeing to buy  Tata Steel Ltd .’s Teesside Cast
Products unit in northeast  England  for $469 million.  SSI is studying the listing among “other options to take
the business forward,” Win Viriyaprapaikit, president of SSI,
said on a conference call today. Tata Steel U.K. Ltd. signed “a
definitive sale agreement” with SSI and aims to complete the
sale of its unit by the end of March, it said in a statement.  The acquisition includes coke ovens, power generation
facilities and the Redcar Blast Furnace. The two said in August
that they signed a memorandum of understanding on the sale.  The steel plant began losing money after four buyers,
making up about 80 percent of its business, reneged on a 10-year
contract in 2009. Italy’s Marcegaglia SpA,  South Korea ’s Dongkuk
Steel Mill Co., Luxembourg-based Ternium SA and Swiss-Italian
steelmaker Duferco Participations Holding Ltd. walked away from
a supply accord on slab steel they process into other products.  SSI said it plans $1 billion of investment at the plant
including the purchase price of $469 million.  “We look forward to resuming production of the top quality
slab for which the plant is renowned as soon as possible,” Viriyaprapaikit said in the statement. “Owning Teesside Cast
Products will enable us to achieve our long-standing ambition of
becoming a fully integrated steel producer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
