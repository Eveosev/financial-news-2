Zimbabwe is seeking to renegotiate
what it charges  Namibia  for electricity exports, according to
Elton Mangoma,  Zimbabwe ’s Minister of Energy.  “The tariff on this export is below cost,” he told
reporters today in the capital, Harare. “The current situation
means that Zimbabwe, despite its own shortage of electricity, is
subsidizing Namibia. This situation has to be corrected.”  Zimbabwe is supplying Namibia with about 150 megawatts as
part of an agreement signed in 2007. Under the accord, Namibia’s
state-owned power utility provided $40 million to refurbish
Zimbabwe’s Hwange coal-fired power station in exchange for
supplies over a five-year period.  Zimbabwe is currently generating between 1,300-1,400
megawatts, against demand of 2,000 megawatts, Mangoma said. The
country is also importing as much as 300 megawatts from Zambia
and  Mozambique , he said. Zesa Holdings, Zimbabwe’s monopoly
power company, owes $100 million for power imports.  The government has put on hold a 33 percent increase in
electricity tariffs announced last week by the regulatory body
to allow more consultations following protests by consumers and
business organizations, Mangoma said.  Zimbabwe has licensed independent power projects, including  RioZim Ltd .’s 2,500 megawatt Sengwa thermal station due for
completion in 2014, to produce a combined 4,500 megawatts,
Mangoma said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
