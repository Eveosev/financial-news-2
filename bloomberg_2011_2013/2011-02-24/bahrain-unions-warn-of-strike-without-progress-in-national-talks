Bahrain’s General Federation for
Trade Unions has warned that it may call a general strike unless
the government and opposition parties open an “appropriate”
dialogue.  “We are observing the situation,” Sayed Salman, the
general secretary of the federation, said in a phone interview
today. “We may go for a strike if there isn’t appropriate
dialogue. The possibility is there. We would have to discuss
this with our trade unions.”  The federation, which has unions representing workers in
the aluminum, oil and transport industries, called a nationwide
strike on Feb. 20 to object to the government’s violent response
to protests. The strike was called off the next day because the
government pledged to respect the right to peaceful protests,
according to an e-mailed statement from the federation.  Seven people have been killed in the demonstrations, which
began on Feb. 14 and calmed down almost a week later after the
government pulled back tanks and armored personnel carriers from
the city center and offered to hold a dialogue with the mostly
Shiite opposition. The protesters are demanding democracy, free
elections and more job opportunities.  Opposition groups have been meeting to draw up demands and
discuss the call for dialogue.  Shiites make up between 60 and 70 percent of the Bahraini
population. The ruling elite is largely Sunni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
