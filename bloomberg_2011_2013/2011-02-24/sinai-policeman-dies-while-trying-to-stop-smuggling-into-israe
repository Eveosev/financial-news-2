Masked smugglers shot dead a
policeman in  Egypt ’s Sinai Peninsula, along the border with
Israel, the state-run Middle East News Agency said.  The gunmen killed 22-year-old officer Tareq Abou Serie in
an exchange of fire as he tried to stop them from smuggling
drugs into Israel, the Egyptian agency said today.  Sinai’s Bedouins, who have had tense relations with the
government in Cairo, have been blamed by authorities for
smuggling weapons and narcotics into Israel.  The peninsula has witnessed frequent clashes between police
and the Bedouins, who complain of state negligence and unfair
arrests. Since the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak  on
Feb. 11, officials have announced plans to release prisoners
held in the peninsula.  To contact the reporter on this story:
