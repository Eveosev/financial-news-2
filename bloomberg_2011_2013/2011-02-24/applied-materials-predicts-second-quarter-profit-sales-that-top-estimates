  Applied Materials Inc ., the world’s
largest producer of chipmaking equipment, predicted second-
quarter profit and sales that topped analysts’ estimates as
demand for its machinery surges.  Earnings excluding some items will be 34 cents to 38 cents
on sales of at least $2.69 billion,  Santa Clara , California-
based Applied Materials said today in a statement. That compares
with profit of 32 cents and revenue of $2.51 billion, the
average of projections compiled by Bloomberg.  Applied Materials and its rivals are benefitting from
increased spending this year by some of the world’s largest
chipmakers.  Intel Corp . said Jan. 13 it will budget as much as
$9.3 billion for new plants and equipment, 79 percent more than
in 2010. Chief Executive Officer Mike Splinter has worked to
diversify the company’s sources of income and is now supplying
machinery used to make solar panels out of silicon wafers.  “This year looks pretty strong for semiconductor
equipment,” said Edwin Mok, a Needham & Co. analyst based in  San
Francisco . He recommends buying the stock and doesn’t own it.
“The semiconductor capital equipment side of the business will
continue to trend pretty well.”  Applied gained as much as 2.5 percent in late trading to
$16.22, after rising 19 cents to $15.83 at 4 p.m. New York time
on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have climbed 13 percent
this year.  For fiscal 2011, the company forecast sales of more than
$11 billion and profit, minus certain items, of more than $1.50
a share. Those compare to analysts’ projections of $10.2 billion
in sales and $1.29 in profit.  Solar Growth  “The fundamentals in our markets are very strong overall,”
Chief Financial Officer  George Davis  in a telephone interview.
“We’ve also seen stronger-than-expected spending in our solar
area.”  Net income in the first quarter, which ended Jan. 30,
increased to $506 million, or 38 cents a share, from $83
million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Sales
rose 45 percent to $2.69 billion. Analysts on average projected
profit of 32 cents and sales of $2.59 billion.  Gross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after
deducting the cost of production, widened to 42.3 percent from
38.5 percent a year earlier. Still, the result missed the 43
percent average of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
