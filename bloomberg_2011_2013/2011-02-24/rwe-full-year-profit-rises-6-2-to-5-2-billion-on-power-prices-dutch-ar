  RWE AG ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, said profit will fall about 30 percent this year
because of a tax on its nuclear reactors and “stagnating”
power prices. The shares fell the most in 10 months.  Recurrent net income, which it uses to calculate the
dividend, will fall from last year’s 3.75 billion euros ($5.17
billion), the Essen-based company said in a statement today. RWE
said it plans to sell assets, reduce spending and extend cost
cuts to grapple with the slump.  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  wants to raise an annual
2.3 billion euros in the six years through 2016 with a tax on
the country’s nuclear stations to help plug the  budget deficit .
RWE, which operates four German reactors as well as generators
that burn coal and gas, also faces slowing earnings as fuel
costs rise faster than wholesale power prices in the region.  “The outlook for 2011 and 2013 is weak,” said Michael Schaefer, an analyst with Equinet AG in Frankfurt who has an
“accumulate” recommendation on the stock. “You also have to
consider that the 2013 forecast includes the effect of the
divestments.”  The shares fell 5.2 percent to 49.39 euros when trading
closed in Frankfurt at 5:30 p.m. for the biggest decline since
April 23. That valued the company at 27.8 billion euros.  Reduce Debt  RWE said it plans to reduce debt by selling assets to raise
as much as 8 billion euros by 2013 and will cut investments
through 2013 by 3 billion euros to 18 billion euros. The company
will extend its cost-cutting program by 200 million euros and
now expects the measures to increase operating profit by 1.4
billion euros in 2012 from the 2006 level.  “Despite our positive performance over the past year, I
have no cause for celebration,” Chief Executive Officer Juergen Grossmann said in a speech today. “We will increasingly be
directing our efforts toward the market of central-eastern and
southeastern  Europe  in the future, where the demand for energy
and the need for investment are equally high.”  Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will fall about 15 percent this year from 10.3
billion euros in 2010, while operating profit will drop about 20
percent from 7.68 billion euros, the company said.  RWE faces higher costs in 2013 when it will pay for all the
carbon dioxide its European  power plants  emit. Ebitda will be
about 8 billion euros that year, the operating result about 5
billion euros and recurrent net income about 2 billion euros,
RWE said. The average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg for recurrent net income in 2013 was 2.65 billion
euros.  Asset Sales  The asset sales will slice 1 billion euros from Ebitda in
2013, 700 million euros from operating profit and 300 million
from recurrent net income, according to the statement.  Recurrent net income rose 6.2 percent in 2010 on higher
power prices and the acquisition of Dutch competitor Essent NV.
The average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for 3.74 billion euros. RWE recommended a dividend of 3.50 euros
a share for 2010, unchanged from the payment for 2009.  RWE, Europe’s largest corporate emitter of carbon-dioxide,
bought operations from Essent last year to access cleaner power
plants and add Dutch and Belgian customers.  The shares have dropped 22 percent in the last 12 months,
valuing the utility at about 27.6 billion euros. Larger rival
E.ON AG has fallen 9.9 percent, while the benchmark German  DAX
Index , which includes both companies, gained 27 percent.  Essent Acquisition  RWE  bought  Arnhem, Netherlands-based Essent in September
2009 for about 7.3 billion euros, gaining 2.6 million customers
as well as renewable energy projects.  The German utility was able to increase earnings during the
global slump because of electricity supply contracts that were
set before a plunge in energy use. German electricity prices, a
European benchmark, have since failed to track gains in the cost
of fossil fuels, reducing the profits of coal-fired generators.  Utilities in the European Union will have to pay for all
the CO2 their power stations emit starting in 2013 as the bloc
implements rules to cut greenhouse gas output.  RWE said today that the German nuclear tax will cut
earnings by an average 600 million euros to 700 million euros a
year starting in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
