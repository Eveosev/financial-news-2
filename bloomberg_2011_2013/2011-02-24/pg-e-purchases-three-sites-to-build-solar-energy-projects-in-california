  PG&E Corp ., the owner of
California’s largest utility, purchased three sites to build
solar energy plants with total capacity of 50 megawatts.  Construction is expected to begin this month at the
locations in California’s Central Valley and will be
“substantially complete” in the third quarter, according to a
notice posted on a company-supported website today and confirmed
by a PG&E spokeswoman.  Solon Corp. and Cupertino Electric Inc. will build the
plants, according to the notice.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
