An Australian price imposed on
carbon emissions would need to be at least A$25 a ton to be
effective,  Origin Energy Ltd . Managing DirectorGrant King said.  “Clearly it will be important to know what the fixed price
will be,” King said during an earnings teleconference from
Sydney. “I would expect that if the government is intending to
cause a real difference it would need to be at least at that
level.”  King commented after Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said the
government intended to impose a price on carbon emissions
starting July 1, 2012. The price would be fixed for three to
five years and be followed by a market-based trading system, she
said in Canberra today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
