  India  will likely retain a clause in
the proposed mining bill that requires miners to share part of
their profits with residents of the area, Mines Secretary S. Vijay Kumar said.  The comments followed an Economic Times report yesterday
that said the  government  may scrap the profit-sharing clause in
the new bill and instead ask miners to pay higher royalties.  “There is absolutely no truth in it,” Vijay Kumar said by
phone today.  The proposed bill, which seeks to replace a law of more
than five decades, stipulates miners should set aside 26 percent
of their profits for local welfare. India’s mineral reserves are
mostly found in provinces afflicted with poverty and social
unrest arising from it.  “I have no doubt the bill will be tabled in this
Parliament session,” Kumar said. “It is being vetted by the
law ministry, which is a procedural part. It will be done very
soon now.”  The bill needs to be cleared by the Cabinet of ministers,
before it seeks the Parliament’s approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
