St. Louis Cardinals 20-game winner
Adam Wainwright will have reconstructive surgery on his pitching
elbow, keeping him sidelined for the entire Major League
Baseball season, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.  The newspaper quoted Cardinals General Manager John
Mozeliak as saying Wainwright, last yearâ€™s National League Cy
Young Award runner-up, will require so-called Tommy John surgery
on his right arm. He said recovery is usually 12 to 15 months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
