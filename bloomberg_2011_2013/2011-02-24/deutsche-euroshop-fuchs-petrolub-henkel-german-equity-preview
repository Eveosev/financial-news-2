German stocks climbed, with the
benchmark  DAX Index  trimming a weekly decline, as carmakers
rallied and a report showed confidence among U.S. consumers rose
more than forecast this month.    Volkswagen AG  jumped 6.2 percent after saying profit surged
sevenfold last year on demand in  China , and forecast growth will
accelerate this year.  MAN SE  gained 4.3 percent as the Financial
Times Deutschland said Volkswagen has pressurized Scania AB to
make a bid for the truckmaker.  Deutsche Telekom AG  fell 1.8
percent as Europe’s largest telecommunications company reported
a surprise fourth-quarter loss.  The DAX rose 0.8 percent to 7,185.17 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Frankfurt. The gauge has retreated 3.3 since peaking at the
highest level since January 2008 at the end of last week. The
measure had its biggest weekly drop since July, trimming this
year’s advance to 3.9 percent. The broader HDAX Index added 0.9
percent today.  “The correction was overdue,” said Matthias Jasper, head
of equities at WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf. “The markets are very
nervous and driven by political uncertainty at the moment, but I
am not overly concerned. I expect ongoing support from the
macro-economic side. The best thing is to remain invested in
equities.”  Stocks slumped this week after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s violent response to anti-government protests triggered
the largest weekly gain in  oil prices  in two years. In the six
weeks since Tunisia’s Zine El Abidine Ben Ali fled his country,
popular uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa have
unseated Egypt’s  Hosni Mubarak  and threaten to do the same to
Qaddafi.  U.S. GDP  German equities extended their gains today as the Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan final sentiment index of U.S.
consumer confidence climbed to 77.5 in February from 74.2 in
January. Economists had predicted an increase to 75.5, according
to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Volkswagen surged 6.2 percent to 119.40 euros, the biggest
gain in four months. Net income increased to 6.84 billion euros
($9.41 billion) from 960 million euros,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker said. Profit beat the 4.96 billion-euro average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 21
percent to 126.8 billion euros.  BMW and Daimler, the world’s biggest makers of luxury cars,
climbed 3 percent to 58.70 euros and 1.2 percent to 51.07 euros,
respectively. Automakers were the best performers among 19
industry groups in the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index today.  MAN Gains  MAN advanced 4.3 percent to 89.50 euros, the first gain in
three days. VW supervisory board Chairman Ferdinand Piech is
pressuring Swedish truckmaker Scania to make an offer for MAN by
April or May at the latest, Financial Times Deutschland
reported, citing unidentified people close to the situation. VW
owns stakes in both companies  Deutsche Telekom lost 1.8 percent to 9.74 euros, the lowest
price this month. The company posted a net loss of 582 million
euros, compared with a loss of 3 million euros a year earlier.
Analysts had predicted net income of 546 million euros. Adjusted
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
dropped to 4.55 billion euros in the fourth quarter, missing the
4.7 billion-euro average estimate of 19 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.    Fuchs Petrolub AG  soared 2.7 percent to 98.77 euros. The
maker of lubricants proposed a 59 percent increase in the annual
dividend on its preferred shares and a 61 percent boost to the
payout on its ordinary shares after “a strong increase in
revenues and profits in 2010.”    United Internet AG  gained 4.2 percent to 12.28 euros, the
biggest advance in almost three months.  Warburg Pincus , a
private-equity investor, bought 5.29 percent of United Internet,
the company said today, without giving financial details. That
stake has a value of about 150 million euros.  Sugar refiner Suedzucker AG rose 3.2 percent to 20.64 euros
as the European Union said it plans to release 500,000 tons of
non-quota sugar onto EU markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
