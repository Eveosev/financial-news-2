China Steel Corp. ,  Taiwan ’s largest
maker of the metal, will increase domestic prices for the second
time this year to reflect rising raw material costs.  Prices will climb by an average of 12.1 percent for April
and May contracts, the Kaohsiung-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The mill announced in January an average
2.9 percent rise in prices charged to Taiwan customers for March.  The price of coking coal, used to make steel, will average
35 percent more in the second quarter from the first three
months as global industrial demand climbs and supplies fall in
the wake of Australian flooding, according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. Raw materials account for 70 percent
of  China Steel ’s costs, the company’s chairman, Tsou Jo-chi,
said in November.  Prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark product, will
increase by an average NT$2,945 ($99) a metric ton, the company
said in the statement.  China Steel rose 0.2 percent to close at NT$33.60 in Taipei
trading after the announcement. The stock has gained 0.3 percent
this year, compared with a 4.8 percent drop in the benchmark
Taiex index.  The company will increase plate prices by an average
NT$2,949 a ton, bar and wire rods by NT$2,500 and cold-rolled
steel by NT$2,747, according to the statement. It will raise
prices of electro-galvanized sheets by NT$3,500 a ton,
electrical sheets by NT$2,000, and hot-dipped zinc-galvanized
sheets by NT$3,167.  No percentage changes were given for the types of products
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on the story:
