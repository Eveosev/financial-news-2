Brazil’s real may strengthen against
Chile’s peso, the weakest emerging-market currency of the last
three days, because rising oil prices are negative for  Chile ’s
terms of trade and neutral for  Brazil ’s, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  BNP Paribas strategist  Diego Donadio  recommended betting
the peso falls to 295 per real from around 286.9 per real,
Donadio said.  To contact the reporter responsible on this story:
