  Iberdrola SA ’s 2010 profit rose more
than analysts expected as it generated more electricity with
hydropower plants and wind turbines.  Net income for the world’s biggest producer of  wind energy 
rose 1.6 percent to 2.87 billion euros ($4 billion) compared
with analysts’ estimates of 2.84 billion euros, the Bilbao,
Spain-based company said. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization rose 11 percent to 7.5 billion
euros.  The results “reflect the strength of operations,” Antonio Cruz-Guzman said in a note to clients. “Ebitda was higher than
the guidance.”    Spain ’s largest utility generates more than half its power
outside the country after expanding abroad to cut reliance on
the domestic market, where demand fell in 2009 and regulators
let it recoup only a portion of costs. Iberdrola is trying to
sell more assets after buying U.S. utility Energy East Corp. in
2008 and Scottish Power Ltd. in 2007.  Iberdrola had pre-tax gains of about 300 million euros from
asset sales last year, Chief Financial Officer Jose Sainz said
on a conference call today.  The stock fell as much 1.1 percent to 6.114 euros in Madrid
trading. The shares traded at 6.138 euros at 1:50 p.m. local
time, giving Iberdrola a market value of 34 billion euros.  Carbon-Free Generation  Iberdrola has targeted average annual growth of 5 percent
to 9 percent in Ebitda from 2009 through 2012.  Electricity production rose 8 percent to 154,073 gigawatt
hours. Half of that power was made without emitting carbon
dioxide, the company said in a press release. Hydropower output
increased 85 percent, while  wind turbines  generated 18 percent
more electricity.  Iberdrola last year said that net investment from 2010
through 2012 may total 16 billion euros as it spends more on
renewable-energy projects and networks. Gross investment may
climb to 18 billion euros, while asset sales may raise as much
as 2.5 billion euros through 2012. Almost two-thirds of the
planned gross investment was earmarked for the U.S. and the U.K.  The utility said in February 2009 that it had a “flexible
approach to investment” and committed to spend only 9.6 billion
euros of the estimated 16 billion-euro net investment through
2012. It targets annual cost savings of 300 million euros by
2012.  Iberdrola last month agreed to buy  Brazil ’s Elektro
Eletricidade & Servicos SA for 1.77 billion euros, gaining power
distribution in an economy expanding at the fastest pace in more
than two decades.  The Spanish utility’s installed capacity totals 44,991
megawatts, of which natural gas-fired plants account for 29
percent, renewable energy 28 percent, hydropower 22 percent, and
nuclear plants 7.4 percent.  Iberdrola Renovables SA , the
company’s renewable-energy unit, increased its capacity to
12,532 gigawatts last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
