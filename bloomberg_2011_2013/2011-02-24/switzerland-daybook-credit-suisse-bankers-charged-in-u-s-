Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  had four
workers charged with conspiring to help U.S. clients evade taxes
through secret bank accounts, according to an indictment
yesterday and people familiar with the matter.  Marco Parenti Adami, Emanuel Agustoni, Michele Bergantino
and Roger Schaerer conspired with clients at “one of the biggest
banks in Switzerland,” according to an indictment in federal
court in Alexandria, Virginia. Zurich-based Credit Suisse, the
second-biggest bank in Switzerland, is the bank, according to
the people who requested anonymity because they aren’t
authorized to speak publicly about the indictment.  WHAT TO WATCH:
