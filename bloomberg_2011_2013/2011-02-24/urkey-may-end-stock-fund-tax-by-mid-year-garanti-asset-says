  Turkey  may remove a tax on equity
funds by mid-year, a move that will help support the country’s
capital markets, Istanbul-based Garanti Asset Management said.  Investments in stock funds are subject to a 10 percent tax
on  capital gains , while no tax is levied on gains for trades in
individual equities, according to Gur Cagdas, chief executive
officer of Garanti Asset, which oversees about $4.7 billion.  “We are talking on this issue with the  finance ministry  at
every stage and we expect the 10 percent withholding tax to be
abolished in the first half of the year,” Cagdas said in an
interview in Istanbul at his office. “This tax inequality
certainly blocks development of the system.”  Garanti Asset manages 7.6 billion lira ($4.7 billion)
assets, compared with a total 48.1 billion liras held among 28
management companies in the country, according to data on the
Ankara-based Capital Markets Board’s website. Garanti Asset is
unit of Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS, the Turkish lender in which  Spain ’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA agreed to buy a 25
percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
