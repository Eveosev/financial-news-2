Hanwha SolarOne Co., the Chinese
solar-products maker formerly known as Solarfun Power Holdings
Co., is seeking merger and acquisition opportunities to cut
costs, Chief Executive Officer Xie Ping said.  The Shanghai-based company wants to acquire companies to
secure raw materials for its solar module production business
and develop projects using its own equipment, Xie said yesterday
in an interview at a solar conference in  Shanghai .  “SolarOne is interested in small and medium silicon-
material makers that may require capital investment, probably in
South Korea,” Xie said. “We may cooperate with several
partners to develop solar power projects in  Europe  and  North
America .”  Chinese solar products manufacturers like LDK Solar Co. and
Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. have begun investing in projects
that generate electricity from the sun to enjoy economies of
scale.  “The solar industry is facing consolidation,” Xie said.
“Solar producers are rushing to increase the scale of output to
reduce costs”.  Hanwha Chemical Corp., the largest shareholder of SolarOne,
may enter the polysilicon business, company spokesman Kwon Hyuk
Bum said by phone Feb. 22, in response to a Maeil Business
Newspaper report that said it will invest 1 trillion won ($888
million) in a  production line  in South Korea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
