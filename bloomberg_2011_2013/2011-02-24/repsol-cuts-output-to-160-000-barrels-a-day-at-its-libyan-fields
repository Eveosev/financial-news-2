  Repsol YPF SA , Spain’s largest crude
producer, reduced oil production at its fields in  Libya  to
160,000 barrels a day, a spokesman said.  That’s down from the usual 360,000 barrels a day, said
Kristian Rix, a spokesman, by phone from Madrid, where the
company is based. Those figures include production allocated to
state-run National Oil Corp., its partner company, he said.  Rix couldn’t immediately say how much Repsol takes of the
current reduced production. Its share of the pre-crisis
production was 40,000 barrels, Rix said. Its main field in Libya
is El Sharara, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
