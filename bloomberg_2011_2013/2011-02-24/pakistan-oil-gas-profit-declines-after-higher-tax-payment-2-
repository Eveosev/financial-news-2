Oil & Gas Development Co.,  Pakistan ’s biggest energy explorer, reported a 9.4 percent
decline in fiscal second-quarter profit after paying higher tax.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to 14.9
billion rupees ($175 million), or 3.46 rupees a share, from 16.4
billion rupees, or 3.82 rupees, a year earlier, the Islamabad-
based company said in a statement to the  stock exchange  today.
Sales rose 2 percent to 41.6 billion rupees.  Pakistan, which imports 80 percent of its petroleum
consumption, needs to increase energy production to help curb a
widening deficit. The government gives exploration companies an
incentive of paying a lower  tax rate  when drilling increases.  “The tax rate was higher because the company spent less on
exploration this quarter,” said Hamad Aslam, a research analyst
at BMA Capital in Karachi, who has a “sell” recommendation on
the stock. Exploration expenses declined to 1 billion rupees in
the second quarter from 3.5 billion rupees a year earlier, Oil &
Gas said in the statement.  The tax burden also rose because of levies paid in advance
to reimburse the government for land damaged from drilling,
Basharat Mirza, the company spokesman, said by telephone from
Islamabad.  Energy demand in Pakistan is three times supply, according
to government estimates. The country’s energy resources are
depleting, prompting the government to increase  gas prices  in a
bid to encourage exploration and help meet demand.  Reduced Production  Oil & Gas shares rose rose 0.9 percent to 158.08 rupees at
the 3:30 p.m. local time close on the Karachi Stock Exchange.
The stock has fallen 7.5 percent this year.  The explorer’s crude production “contracted 2.6 percent
because of depleting oilfield sources like the one called Dodak
in the south, which contributes 14 percent of the company’s
total production,” Shahbaz Ashraf, a research analyst with Arif
Habib Ltd., wrote in a report to clients on Feb. 22. He has a
“sell” recommendation on the stock.  The government, which owns a 75 percent stake in Oil & Gas,
plans to raise as much as $1 billion by selling convertible
bonds globally to help bridge a widening deficit, Privatization
Minister Naveed Qamar said in an interview yesterday.  Energy Prices  Prices of oil and gas in Pakistan climbed 12 percent and 22
percent, respectively, from the previous year because of rising
global prices, Ashraf said.  Oil advanced to the highest in 30 months in  London  as  Libya ’s violent uprising reduced supplies from  Africa ’s third-
biggest producer.  Brent oil for April settlement rose as much as $8.54, or
7.7 percent, to $119.79 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest since Aug. 21, 2008. The contract traded
at $116.33 at 9:45 a.m. London time. It has rallied 13 percent
this week.  Crude for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained as much as $5.31, or 5.4 percent, to $103.41 a
barrel in electronic trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
