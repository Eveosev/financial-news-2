  Repsol YPF SA ,  Spain ’s biggest oil
company, said fourth-quarter profit more than doubled after
refining margins improved and crude prices increased.  Profit adjusted to exclude inventories and one-time items
climbed to 499 million euros ($688 million) from 241 million
euros a year earlier, the Madrid-based company said today.
That’s in line with the 491 million-euro mean estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  The company’s refining margins are improving after demand
fell with the global economic slump. It’s investing in
exploration in  Brazil ’s offshore  Santos Basin  and elsewhere to
increase output while seeking to reduce stakes in maturing
fields in  Argentina .  Repsol’s results makes the company an attractive target,
Chief Executive Officer Antonio Brufau said at a news
conference. “If someone wants to put a hand on this company, it
costs 40 billion euros, minimum,” he said.  Repsol shares rose 1.6 percent to 23.88 euros in  Madrid .
The stock is up 15 percent this year, valuing Repsol at 29
billion euros.  The company is spending to improve refining margins and new
units at its refineries in Bilbao and Cartagena will start
operating at the end of 2011. The refining margin indicator for
Spain, a measurement of the profit from turning crude into
fuels, widened to $2.90 a barrel last quarter from zero a year
earlier, Repsol said.  Crude Gains  Brent oil prices were 16 percent higher in the quarter than
a year earlier, Repsol said. Crude in  New York  today surged to
the highest level in 29 months as Libya’s uprising reduced
supplies from  Africa ’s third-biggest oil-producing country.  Repsol on Feb. 22 said it’s suspending its exploration and
production operations in Libya. Repsol has been in Libya since
the 1970s, and had net production of 34,777 barrels a day there
in 2009, equal to 3.8 percent of its output. The unrest in  Libya 
will “clearly” impact earnings at Repsol, Brufau said today.  The company forecasts annual production growth of as much
as 4 percent through 2014 as projects in  Brazil  and  Peru  start
output. Repsol plans to invest 28 billion euros in the period
2010 to 2014, developing fields in Venezuela, Bolivia and  Algeria . It will invest about 6 billion euros this year and its
drilling plan for 2011 includes 25 to 30 exploration and
evaluation wells, Repsol said today in a presentation.  Reserve Replacement  The reserve replacement ratio rose to 131 percent last
year, meaning it found more oil than it produced, up from 94
percent in 2009. The company has estimated a ratio of more than
110 percent in the next five years.  Oil and gas production at Repsol’s upstream division, which
doesn’t include the Argentine unit YPF, fell 2.3 percent from a
year earlier to 341,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the
fourth quarter as some fields dropped and because of inspections
at the U.S. Shenzi project. Output from Buenos Aires-based YPF
fell 2.5 percent to 511,000 barrels a day following an oil
workers’ strike in southern  Argentina .  Repsol has been seeking to sell part of its 80 percent
stake in YPF and aims to keep at least 51 percent, Brufau said
in April. On Dec. 23, it agreed to sell 3.3 percent for $500
million to funds advised by Eton Park Capital Management,
Capital Guardian Trust Co. and Capital International Inc. Eton
Park also has an option to buy an additional 1.63 percent.  Argentine investor Sebastian Eskenazi, whose family bought
15 percent of YPF from Repsol for $2.2 billion in 2007, also has
an option to boost the stake to 25 percent by 2012.  China Petrochemical Corp.,  China ’s second-largest oil and
gas producer, last year agreed to invest $7.1 billion in
Repsol’s Brazilian unit as the company raises funds for offshore
projects. That deal generated a $3.76 billion accounting gain
for Repsol. Sinopec Group, as the company is known, holds 40
percent of that division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
