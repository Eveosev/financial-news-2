Most American stocks rose and oil
retreated below $100 a barrel after the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and  International Energy Agency  said they could offset any supply
disruptions from Libya. Yields on 30-year Treasuries fell to the
lowest level this month, and the Swiss franc climbed to a record
against the dollar.  About four stocks gained for every three that fell on U.S.
exchanges at 4 p.m. in New York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
lost 0.1 percent for the third straight drop. Crude futures
slumped 0.8 percent to $97.28 a barrel after touching $103.41,
the highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008. Treasury 30-
year yields decreased to 4.54 percent from 4.58 percent. The
franc strengthened to a record 92.34 centimes per dollar.  Equities rebounded today after oil declined and reports
showed jobless claims fell and  consumer confidence  increased.
The  S&P 500  had lost 2.7 percent this week, the biggest two-day
slide in six months, as crude extended its surge since Feb. 15
to 16 percent after Libyan protests intensified. Oil slipped
today after President Barack Obama said the U.S. will be able to
“ride out” a cut resulting from turmoil in the North African
nation. The crisis has trimmed supply by 500,000 to 750,000
barrels a day, the IEA said today.  “We need to have a bit more clarity on how bad this oil
situation could become,” said  David Kelly , who helps oversee
$450 billion as chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in New
York. “In the long run, I don’t see the world oil production
being affected. If what’s going on isn’t enough to derail what
seems to be a strengthening U.S. expansion, then it’s just a
minor correction, not another bear market. In such a case,
stocks will rebound and this will be a buying opportunity.”  Boeing, GM    Boeing Co . added 0.8 percent as government data showed
demand for aircraft rebounded. It rose another 3.4 percent at
5:57 p.m., following the close of U.S. stock exchanges, after
winning a $35 billion program to build 179 aerial refueling
tankers from the U.S. Air Force.    Priceline.com Inc . soared 8.5 percent as the online travel
agency’s earnings forecast beat estimates.  General Motors Co .
tumbled to $32.05, the lowest price since its initial public
offering in November, as oil’s recent surge dimmed the outlook
for truck sales.  Exxon Mobil Corp . and  Schlumberger Ltd . dropped
more than 1.2 percent as crude oil fell.  The IEA said that it is ready to release emergency oil
stockpiles, if needed. The Paris-based  agency , founded in 1974
in response to the Arab oil embargo, advises 28 developed
nations, including the U.S., Japan and  Germany .  ‘Will Stabilize’  “We actually think that we’ll be able to ride out the  Libya  situation and it will stabilize,” Obama said to members
of his outside council on jobs and competitiveness at the White
House.  Reuters  reported  that oil declined as traders speculated
that Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi  had been shot. The news service
then quoted an unidentified U.S. official who said the
government had  no reason  to believe Qaddafi is dead.  Qaddafi, who has lost control of much of the country’s oil-
rich east, blamed the uprising against his 41-year rule on
“drugged kids” and al-Qaeda as Switzerland froze some of his
assets. Libya is Africa’s third-biggest oil producer.  Qaddafi, speaking by telephone on state television today,
appealed to citizens to end violence while his forces stepped up
a crackdown on opponents and moved tanks into positions
defending the capital, Tripoli. He said he regretted the deaths
during the unrest, which protesters blamed on pro-government
forces opening fire on regime opponents and random civilians.  Fed Purchases  Ten-year Treasury yields reached a three-week low of 3.41
percent as the U.S. auctioned $29 billion in seven year notes in
the final of three sales this week totaling $99 billion. The
yield touched the lowest since Feb. 2 as loyalists of Muammar Qaddafi sought to crush dissent in Libya. The  Federal Reserve 
purchased $5 billion in Treasuries with maturities ranging from
November 2012 to August 2013 today as part of its planned $600
billion in purchases to support the economy.  The Swiss franc strengthened to a record 92.34 centimes per
dollar before trading at 92.64 at 5 p.m. in  New York , up 0.7
percent from 93.30 yesterday. The euro rose 0.4 percent to
$1.3800, after climbing to $1.3821, the strongest since Feb. 3.  The yen appreciated 0.8 percent to 81.89 per dollar, its
seventh straight day of gains, the longest run this year. It
touched 81.63, the strongest level since Feb. 4. The Japanese
currency was 0.4 percent stronger at 113.02 per euro.  Asian Currencies  Asian currencies slid on speculation the global economy
will slow as oil prices surge. Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.8
percent to NT$29.80, the worst performance among the dollar’s 16
most-traded counterparts.  South Korea ’s won  was the second-
worst performer, dropping 0.6 percent to 1,131.05 per dollar.  The euro briefly extended gains as a member of the ECB
Governing Council, outgoing Bundesbank President  Axel Weber ,
said interest rates can only rise in the future.  “Interest rates know only one direction, and that is
north,” Weber said in a panel discussion in Frankfurt today.  ECB policy makers will make the decisions necessary to
maintain  price stability , President  Jean-Claude Trichet  told
reporters yesterday in Frankfurt. The bank, which meets March 3,
has kept its benchmark rate at 1 percent since May 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
