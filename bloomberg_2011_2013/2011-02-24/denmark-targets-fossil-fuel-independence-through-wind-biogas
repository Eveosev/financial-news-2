  Denmark ’s government presented a
plan to invest in renewable energy including wind power and
biogas as the country seeks independence from oil, gas and coal
by 2050.  By 2020, Denmark will more than double its wind power
capacity to 42 percent of total energy production, the
Copenhagen-based environment ministry said today in an e-mail.
The Nordic country also wants to cut energy consumption by 6
percent by that year.  The government will provide subsidies for biogas
production, increase bio-based additives to fuel, promote new
land-based  wind turbines  and expand existing offshore ones. It
also wants to increase efficiency requirements for energy
producers. Both homeowners and companies will pay more for
electricity and heating, the ministry said, adding that it
doesn’t expect the measures will hurt the country’s
competitiveness.  “No one is saying that carrying out major investments in  energy efficiency  and expanding our use of renewable energy is
going to be free,” said Climate and Energy Minister Lykke Friis, in the statement. “But the alternative is continued
dependence on fossil fuels, which all indicators show will only
become more expensive in the years to come.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
