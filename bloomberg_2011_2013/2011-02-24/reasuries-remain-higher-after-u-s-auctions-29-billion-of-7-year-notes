     Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Treasury notes remained higher after
the U.S. sale of $29 billion in seven-year notes was met with
almost the forecast level of demand.  The notes drew a yield of 2.854 percent, the highest since
3.21 percent April 29, compared with a forecast of 2.855 percent
in a Bloomberg News survey of six of the  Federal Reserve ’s
primary dealers. The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.82, compared with an average of 2.89 for the previous 10
sales. Ten-year yields earlier slid to a three-week low as
loyalists of  Muammar Qaddafi  sought to crush dissent in  Libya ,
which sent crude oil to a 29-month high.  “The market may breathe a bit of a sigh of relief because
it’s better than the two- and five-year auctions,” said  Kevin Flanagan , a Purchase, New York-based fixed-income strategist for
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. “Treasuries will remain well bid
given what’s going on in the Middle East.”  The yield on the current seven-year note fell four basis
points to 2.83 percent at 1:03 p.m. in  New York , according to
BGCantor Market Data. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note
fell five basis points to 3.44 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 49.7 percent of the notes, compared
with an average of 52 percent for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 4.5 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 8.9 percent at the last
10 auctions.  The offering is the last of three note auctions this week
totaling $99 billion. The Treasury sold $35 billion in 2-year
debt on Feb. 23 at a yield of 0.745 percent and $35 billion of
five-year notes yesterday at a yield of 2.19 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
