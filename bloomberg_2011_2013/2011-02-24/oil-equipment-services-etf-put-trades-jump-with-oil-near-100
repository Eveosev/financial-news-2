Put-option trades jumped for an
exchange-traded fund that tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil
and Equipment & Services Index after oil retreated from the
highest level since 2008.  A block of 3,000  iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment &
Services Index Fund  March $60 puts to sell the stock traded at
10:02 a.m. in New York for 85 cents each, 100 percent at the ask
price, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The trade accounted for
almost all options volume.  Today’s total put volume of 3,101 was more than three times
the four-week average and 72 times the number of calls to buy.
The March $60 puts, which were the most-traded contracts, rose
13 percent to 85 cents. The ETF dropped 1.5 percent to $63.23.
It has gained 12 percent this year, while crude oil has advanced
5.8 percent.  Oil jumped as much as 5.4 percent to $103.41 a barrel in
New York before dropping 0.8 percent to settle at $97.28 a
barrel. The rebellion against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  may
have shut 1 million barrels of daily oil output from  Africa ’s
third-biggest producer, according to  Barclays Capital . Oil pared
gains after a Saudi Arabian official said his country and other
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries nations are able
to replace any lost Libyan oil.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
