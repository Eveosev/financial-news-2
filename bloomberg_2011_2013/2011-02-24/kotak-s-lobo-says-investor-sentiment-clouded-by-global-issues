Alroy Lobo, global head of equities
at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., who oversees about $3
billion in stocks, comments on the outlook for Indian stocks,
global oil prices and the government’s budget. He spoke in a
phone interview in Mumbai. The Indian budget will be announced
Feb. 28.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
slumped 3 percent to 17,632.41 in Mumbai today, its steepest
decline since November 2009.  “Oil is definitely a serious issue. It’s very difficult
for market participants to figure out to what extent this
elevated level of oil price will prevail.  India  is highly
levered to oil imports and it impacts our fiscal and current
account deficit and therefore the balance of payments. The
sentiment now is more clouded by global issues.  “One will take some clue from the budget. Markets would
like all the concerns such as elevated oil prices to be priced
in. I think we are coming closer to levels where markets are
looking reasonably attractive from a valuation perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
