(Corrects earnings per share in second paragraph.)  Oil & Gas Development Co.,  Pakistan ’s biggest energy explorer, reported a 9.4 percent
decline in fiscal second-quarter profit after it paid more tax.  Net income in the three months ended Dec. 31 fell to 14.9
billion rupees ($174.5 million), or 3.46 rupees a share, from
16.4 billion rupees, or 3.82 rupees, a year earlier, the
Islamabad-based company said in a statement to the  stock
exchange  today. Sales rose to 41.6 billion rupees from 40.8
billion rupees.  “The net profit was below our expectations because they
paid more in tax,” Umer Bin Ayaz, research analyst at JS Global
Capital Ltd. in Karachi, said after the announcement. “It was a
surprise that they didn’t pay out a cash dividend.”  Demand for energy in Pakistan is three times supply,
according to government estimates. The shortage is being driven
depleting resources of the country’s fields, prompting the
government has increased  gas prices  to encourage exploration and
help meet demand.  Oil & Gas shares fell 0.1 percent to 156.50 rupees at 1:45
p.m. local time on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The share has
fallen 8.4 percent this year.  The company’s crude production “contracted 2.6 percent
because of depleting oilfields sources like the one called
Dodak, in the south, which contributes 14 percent of the
company’s total production,” Shahbaz Ashraf, a research analyst
with Arif Habib Ltd., who has a “sell” recommendation on the
stock, wrote in a report to clients on Feb. 22.  The government, which owns a majority stake in Oil & Gas,
plans to raise as much as $1 billion by selling convertible
bonds internationally to help bridge a widening deficit,
Privatization Minister Naveed Qamar said in an interview
yesterday.  Prices for oil and gas in Pakistan rose 12 percent and 22
percent, respectively, from the previous year because of rising
global prices, Ashraf said.  Crude rose from the highest close in more than two years as  Libya ’s violent uprising threatened to disrupt exports from  Africa ’s third-biggest supplier and spread to other crude-
producing nations in the Middle East.  Crude for April delivery gained as much as 66 cents to
$96.08 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $95.86 at 1:31 p.m. Sydney time yesterday.
Yesterday, it increased $5.71 to $95.42, the highest since
October 2008. Futures are up 21 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
