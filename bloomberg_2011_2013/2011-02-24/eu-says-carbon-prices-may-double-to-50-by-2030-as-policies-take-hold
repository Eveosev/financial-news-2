European Union regulators see the
possibility of carbon prices doubling in the next two decades
as the bloc tries to limit pollution, a document obtained by
Bloomberg shows.  Emissions permits may cost 36 euros ($50) a metric ton in
2030, 51.50 euros in 2040 and 50 euros by 2050, according to the
draft document, prepared for a presentation on climate targets
to EU member states next month. Allowances for December delivery
rose 0.9 percent at 15.42 euros at 1:20.m. on  London ’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The European Commission, the EU regulator, is setting 
scenarios for CO2 prices in the world's largest cap-and-trade
program, cornerstone of its plan to reduce emissions blamed
for  climate change . The projections in the ``reference scenario'' 
in the document dated Feb. 9 are “significantly higher” than
those in those used in the regulator’s last analysis published 
in May 2010, according to the draft.  Isaac Valero-Ladron, climate spokesman for the EU
regulator, declined to comment because the draft is still in
“internal discussions.” The EU plans to release its roadmap
for climate targets through 2050 on March 8, he said earlier
this week.  The EU allows permits that aren’t used in a given trading
period to be carried over into the next phase. The EU cap-and-
trade program, started in 2005, is now in its second trading
phase, which ends in 2012. In the third phase, running from 2013
to 2020, the total limit on  greenhouse gases  becomes
progressively lower each year.  Leftover Permits  The commission’s roadmap will be discussed by environment
ministers from the bloc’s 27 nations at their meeting on March
14. Higher price assumptions in the latest draft reflect that
permits can be held over as emission caps are decreased.  “The main cause is additional action and banking over a
longer period of time motivated by expectations on increases of
allowances prices in the future due to the continuously
decreasing cap after 2030 to 2050,” according to the draft.  A draft summary circulated last week showed that the
commission is considering withholding 500 million to 800 million
allowances in the next round of the program from 2013. The
amount would correspond to the surplus that can be carried over
from the current five-year phase that ends in 2012, according to
the commission estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
