  Rwanda ’s central bank maintained its
key repo lending rate at 6 percent, after three reductions in
the past year, to support an economic growth target of 7 percent
this year.  There may be room to cut rates in future as inflation
remains subdued and policy makers look to boost lending by
commercial banks, the National Bank of Rwanda said today in a
statement handed to reporters in Kigali, the capital.  “Lending to the private sector has not been increasing as
expected to sustain high economic growth in the medium term,”
the bank said.  The bank is targeting lending growth of 22.4 percent this
year, up from 12.7 percent in 2010, according to the statement.
The bankers’ association said on Nov. 23 that they won’t
increase lending to levels targeted by central bank until there
are more credit-worthy projects to fund, and non-performing
loans decline.  The central bank reduced the key lending rate to 7.5
percent from 9 percent in March, to 7 percent in June and to 6
percent in November.  Inflation accelerated to 1.09 percent in January from 0.23
percent the month before, the  National Institute of Statistics 
said on Feb. 16.  “Inflation is projected to be contained at 6 percent
maximum in 2011 and 5 percent in medium term,” the central bank
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
