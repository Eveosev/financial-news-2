Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB,  Mexico ’s fifth-largest landline phone carrier, replaced Chief
Executive Officer William Nazaret after reporting four
consecutive quarterly losses.  Salvador Alvarez, former CEO of medical services company
Aplicaciones Medicales Integrales SA, will take over for
Nazaret, Maxcom said yesterday in a statement. Nazaret, who led
Maxcom for two years, will be an external adviser for a
transition period before returning to the U.S., Maxcom said.  Maxcom is offering packages of phone, Internet and TV
service to lure customers from larger rival Telefonos de Mexico
SAB. While its residential lines increased 5 percent from a year
earlier to almost 238,000, business lines dropped 16 percent to
more than 65,000.  Maxcom’s fourth-quarter loss of 949 million pesos ($77
million) compared with income of 23 million pesos a year
earlier, the company said yesterday in a filing to Mexico’s
stock exchange. Sales rose 1.3 percent to 639 million pesos,
missing the 653 million-peso estimate of analyst Karla Beatriz Pena of Corp. Actinver SAB in Mexico City.  Maxcom fell 4 centavos to 6.35 pesos yesterday before the
CEO change and fourth-quarter results were announced. The shares
have dropped 2.6 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
