(Corrects Worcester spelling in the second paragraph.)  Quest Diagnostics Inc. agreed to buy
a laboratory business from  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . for
$740 million in cash as it expands into testing for neurological
disorders including Alzheimer’s disease.  Athena Diagnostics, based in Worcester,  Massachusetts , has
more than 350 tests to confirm or rule out physicians’ diagnoses
of Alzheimer’s and neuromuscular and developmental disorders,
Madison, New Jersey-based Quest said today in a statement. The
deal is expected to close in the second quarter.  About 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer’s, including 5.1
million over age 65, according to the  Alzheimer’s Association .
Someone develops the condition every 70 seconds, with the
frequency expected to grow to every 33 seconds by mid-century,
according to the Chicago-based organization.  “Athena will be the principal beneficiary of the
accelerated demand for diagnostic testing as new and earlier
therapies are developed for neurological conditions such as
Alzheimer’s disease,” Quest Chief Executive Officer Surya N. Mohapatra said in the statement.  Quest declined 5 cents to $56.61 at 9:30 a.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading, and the shares were little
changed in the 12 months before today. Thermo Fisher fell 43
cents to $54.54, and was up 11 percent in the last 12 months
through yesterday.  Diagnostic Acquisitions  There have been 354 acquisitions announced in the last five
years of companies in the scientific instruments and diagnostics
industries, according to Bloomberg data. The average disclosed
deal size was $214.4 million, the data show.  Thermo Fisher, the world’s largest maker of laboratory
instruments, also said in a separate statement that it will sell
Lancaster Laboratories to  Eurofins Scientific  SE for $200
million, and said it will buy back $750 million in stock.  The company’s board approved the new share-repurchase
program, which expires Feb. 22, 2012. Thermo Fisher said it has
$385 million remaining under an existing buyback plan, which
