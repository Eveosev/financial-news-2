  Jumbo SA ,  Greece ’s biggest toy
retailer, said fiscal first-half profit advanced 9.3 percent
after a tax applied on last year’s earnings wasn’t repeated.  Net income rose to 54 million euros ($74.3 million) in the
six months through December, from 49.4 million euros in the same
period a year earlier, the Athens-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Jumbo took a 9.8 million euro charge in
the first-half last year for a special levy imposed by the Greek
government.  Sales fell 0.7 percent to 290.2 million euros, hurt by
lower  consumer spending  in Greece as the government implements
austerity measures, including salary cuts and a higher  sales
tax . The measures are part of terms agreed last May with the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund  in exchange for
110 billion euros in emergency loans to stave off a default.  Jumbo, which also sells baby products and stationery,
expects six new hyperstores it opened in the period to
“contribute to the group’s future growth,” the statement said.  The company plans to open three new stores in Greece and
another three in Bulgaria by June 2012, the statement said. The
retailer has 51 outlets currently, with 44 in Greece, three in
Cyprus and four in Bulgaria.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell 11 percent to 75.5 million euros, Jumbo said.  For Related News and Information:
