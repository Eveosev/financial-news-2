Italian business confidence
unexpectedly fell this month from the highest in almost three
years after economic growth lost momentum and executives grew
pessimistic about the strength of the recovery.  The manufacturing-sentiment index declined to 103 from a
revised 103.4 in January, which was the highest since February
2008, national statistics office Istat said in Rome today.
Economists had predicted a reading of 103.8, according to the
median of 11 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Istat cited “a worsening in the production outlook and
higher stocks.” Expectations for growth and orders showed “a
slight decline.”  Expansion in the euro-region’s third-biggest economy slowed
more than economists forecast in the fourth quarter as
industrial output fell 0.2 percent in the same period. Exports
of Italian goods failed to offset weak domestic demand that was
held back by an  unemployment rate  at close to the highest level
since monthly records began in 2004.  Car registrations in  Italy  fell 21 percent in January, with
domestic sales of  Fiat SpA , the country’s biggest manufacturer,
dropping 28 percent, the Transportation Ministry said Feb. 1.  The pessimism among leaders of Italian companies contrasts
with optimism about the euro-region’s largest economy. Business
confidence in  Germany  unexpectedly rose to a record high in
February as exports spurred hiring and consumer spending.  Italy last year emerged from its worst recession in more
than 60 years. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  this month
predicted the $2.3 trillion economy will expand 1.5 percent in
2011. That’s more than a Sept. 29 projection of 1.3 percent and
the fastest pace since 2007.  Istat polled 4,000 companies between Feb. 1 and Feb. 17.
The institute revised business confidence in January from a
previous reading of 103.6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
