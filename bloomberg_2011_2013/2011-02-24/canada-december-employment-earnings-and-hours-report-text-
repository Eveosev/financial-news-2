The following is the text of
Canada's employment, earnings, and hours report for
December released by Statistics  Canada .  Between December 2009 and December 2010, average weekly
earnings of non-farm payroll employees rose 4.5% to
$872.12. December marked the fifth consecutive month
during which year-over-year growth was above 4.0%. In
comparison, average weekly earnings grew by 2.4% from
December 2008 to December 2009.  Some of the growth in weekly earnings between December
2009 and December 2010 was attributable to a 1.8% increase
in the average workweek to 33.0 hours. This followed a
0.5% decline in average hours from December 2008 to
December 2009. The remainder of the year-over-year wage
increase in December reflects a number of other factors,
including wage growth, changes in the composition of
employment by industry, changes in occupations within
industries and job experience.  Average weekly earnings increased in every province.
Growth was above the national average in Prince  Edward
Island , Nova Scotia,  Alberta , Newfoundland and Labrador,
and  Quebec .  New Brunswick  and British Columbia had the
slowest growth.  Average weekly earnings by industry  Among the 10 largest industries, growth in average
weekly earnings between December 2009 and December 2010
was above the national average of 4.5% in professional,
scientific and technical services; manufacturing;
administrative and support services; construction; as well
as accommodation and food services. The slowest growth in
earnings occurred in public administration.  Average weekly earnings in professional, scientific and
technical services increased by 8.5% in the 12 months to
December. Most of this gain was driven by a notable
increase between November and December associated with
larger than usual year-end payments such as bonuses and
annual payments. Year-over-year growth in earnings was
strong in eight of the nine industries in this sector.  Manufacturing earnings increased by 6.2% in the 12
months to December. Growth was particularly strong in a
number of manufacturing industries, including petroleum
and coal products; paper; furniture and related products;
machinery; electrical equipment, appliance and components;
and primary metals.  Average weekly earnings rose by 6.1% in administrative
and support services in the 12 months to December.
Earnings in this industry have been increasing since May
2009.  Earnings in construction have also been on an upward
trend. From December 2009 to December 2010, earnings rose
by 4.9%, with particularly strong growth in heavy and
civil engineering construction and specialty trade
contractors.  Earnings in accommodation and food services were up
4.7%, with most of the growth in traveller accommodation;
full-service restaurants; and drinking places.  Growth in average weekly earnings was also strong in
some smaller industries. Earnings in arts, entertainment
and recreation have been on an upward trend. From December
2009 to December 2010, earnings in this industry rose by
10.9%, the fastest among all industries. Growth was
particularly strong for spectator sports as well as
independent artists, writers and performers.  In forestry, logging and support activities, average
weekly earnings increased by 8.6%, driven fully by
earnings growth in the logging industry.  Non-farm payroll employment by industry  Non-farm payroll employment increased by 0.3% (+40,900)
from November to December, the seventh consecutive month
of job gains. Between December 2009 and December 2010, the
number of payroll employees increased by 2.0% (+297,600).  Payroll employment rose in both the goods and services
sectors in December compared with November.  In manufacturing, payroll employment increased by 6,500
(+0.4%) from November to December. Payroll jobs in this
industry increased steadily in the 12 months to December,
up 1.9% (+27,900). Most of the gains during 2010 were in
machinery; primary metal; food; fabricated metal product;
plastics and rubber products; and petroleum and coal
product manufacturing.  Payroll jobs in retail trade increased by 6,200 (+0.3%)
in December, the third consecutive month of gains. These
gains made up for losses earlier in 2010, and left
employment unchanged in December compared with December
2009.  The number of payroll jobs in administrative and
support services rose by 5,800 (+0.8%) in December,
bringing total gains in 2010 to 18,000 (+2.5%). The
increases over the year were primarily in employment
services and services to buildings and dwellings.  There were also gains in educational services;
transportation and warehousing; professional, scientific
and technical services; mining, quarrying and oil and gas
extraction and health care and social assistance in
December.  From December 2009 to December 2010, the three
industries with the fastest rates of job growth were
mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction (+13.2%),
construction (+3.2%) and professional, scientific and
technical services (+2.6%).  Hours worked and average hours worked by hourly and
salaried employees  Total hours worked by hourly and salaried employees
increased by 0.3% in December compared with November. In
the 12 months to December, total hours advanced by 3.4%.  Average weekly hours worked by hourly and salaried
employees amounted to 33.0 hours in December, unchanged
from November and up 1.8% from December 2009.  Note to readers  Every March 31, as part of the regularly scheduled year-
end review of the Survey of Employment, Payrolls and Hours
(SEPH), seasonally adjusted data are revised using the
latest seasonal factors. On March 31, a new seasonal
adjustment model (X-12-ARIMA) will also be introduced.  In addition, as part of the annual review, there will
be revisions to a small number of industries for the 2006
to 2010 period.  As a result, all seasonally adjusted estimates will be
revised historically back to 2001 and will be available on
CANSIM (Tables 281-0025, 281-0028, 281-0031, and 281-
0034). To facilitate access to the revised data, these
CANSIM tables will be free from March 31 to April 6, 2011.  The SEPH is a business census of non-farm payroll
employees.  Statistics Canada  also produces employment
estimates from its monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS). As a
result of conceptual and methodological differences,
estimates of changes from SEPH and LFS do differ from time
to time. However, the trends in the data are quite
similar.  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents
seasonally adjusted data, which facilitates comparisons by
removing the effects of seasonal variations.  All earnings data include overtime pay and exclude
businesses which could not be classified to a North
American Industrial Classification System code.  Average weekly earnings are derived by dividing total
weekly earnings by the number of employees.  Changes in average earnings can be influenced by a
number of factors. Changes in the level of earnings, the
number of payroll employees, and the number of hours
worked can have an impact. Other factors could include
compositional changes over time, such as changes in the
proportions of full-time and part-time work; proportions
of casual, senior and junior employees; the occupational
distribution within and across industries; and in the
distribution of employment between industries. Such
effects may apply differently within different provinces
and territories, and over time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
