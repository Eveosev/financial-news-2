Houston Ship Channel pilots delayed
boarding 82 waiting inbound vessels after fog returned for a
third day, limiting visibility at the largest U.S. petroleum
port, according to the Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service.  Pilots were going to try to move six outbound vessels in
the next hour, Albert Hernandez, a watch supervisor for the
Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service, said today at 3:30 p.m. in
an interview from Houston. “But not much has changed from this
morning,” he said.  The fog has slowed traffic since early Feb. 22. A dense fog
advisory is in effect until 6 a.m. Feb. 25, the  National Weather
Service  said in a  statement  at 3:19 p.m., and fog is in the
forecast for Feb. 26.  Tankers use the channel connecting the  Gulf of Mexico  to
the Port of Houston to deliver crude oil to refineries in the
Houston-Texas City-Baytown area.  “You need three to five days of sustained fog in the ship
channel before people are going to be really worried,”  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said Feb.
22.  PADD 3, the Energy Department’s designation for the Gulf
Coast region, holds about half of U.S. refining capacity,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
