Democratic Republic of Congo’s Mines
Minister  Martin Kabwelulu  will hold a press conference tomorrow
to address a five-month-long ban on mining in three of its
eastern provinces, a ministry spokesman said.  Congo’s President Joseph Kabila halted mining in Maniema
and North and South Kivu provinces in September to root out the
“mafia groups” that he said controls the mineral trade there.
Kabwelulu said on Feb. 8 that the country was considering
phasing out the ban.  To contact the reporters on this story:
