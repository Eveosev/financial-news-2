  Hunting Plc , a U.K. oil services
provider, raised its 2010 dividend after higher crude prices
encouraged producers to step up investment.  The London-based company lifted the 2010 payout to 12 pence
a share from 10.5 pence a year earlier as sales increased 28
percent to 461.6 million pounds ($748 million). Net income
declined to 21.8 million pounds from 28.7 million pounds a year
earlier, it said in a statement.  Hunting, which services well bores and construction
projects for companies mainly in the U.S., U.K. and  Canada , said
the results reflected a stronger fourth quarter as the price of  Brent crude  surged 40 percent. The company has 212 million
pounds in cash that it will use for investment and more
acquisitions following the purchase of Innova-Extel Holdings
Inc. last year, Finance Director  Peter Rose  said by phone.  “2010 has seen Hunting benefit from increased confidence
in the oil and gas industry,” Chief Executive Officer Dennis
Proctor said in the statement. “In anticipation of this, during
the year the group invested heavily in new facilities and
commenced a number of expansion programs designed to position us
to meet the growing demand for our products and services.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
