  UBS AG ,  Australia ’s top equity
underwriter, said it has dealt with an incident that local
newspapers described as a fistfight between two workers on the
bank’s trading floor in Sydney this week.  “Action has been taken,” Erica Borgelt, a Sydney-based
spokeswoman for  Switzerland ’s biggest bank, said by phone today.
“The matter has been dealt with internally.” She declined to
comment further.  The employees involved in the bust-up, who had known each
other for 15 years, had to be separated by colleagues after a
disagreement over a stock transaction, the  Australian  reported
today. According to the  Australian Financial Review , one co-
worker who attempted to break up the pair -- referred to by the
newspaper as senior managers -- was also hit.  UBS, based in Zurich, took 28 percent of the Australian
equity underwriting market in 2010, more than triple that
of second-ranked JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. UBS has topped that list for five
consecutive years.  Calls to the pair identified in the newspaper reports were
answered by colleagues, who took messages on their behalf. The
calls hadn’t been returned by mid-afternoon in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
