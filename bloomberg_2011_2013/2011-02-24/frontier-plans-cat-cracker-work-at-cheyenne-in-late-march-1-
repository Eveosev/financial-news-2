  Frontier Oil Corp . will shut a fluid
catalytic cracker and an alkylation unit for planned work from
late March into April at its Cheyenne refinery in Wyoming, a
company executive said in a conference call.  Planned work on an alkylation unit at the companyâ€™s El
Dorado refinery in  Kansas  has been postponed from this fall
until the spring of 2012, said James Stump, vice president of
refining operations at Frontier, during the call today.  The crude throughput rate during the first quarter at the
Kansas refinery is expected to average 134,000 barrels a day,
according to Stump. Oil processing at the Wyoming plant is
expected to average 42,000 barrels a day in the same period.  Frontier is increasing the amount of heavy crude it
processes at El Dorado by about 25 percent and at Cheyenne by
about 60 percent for a combined total of approximately 60,000
barrels a day, Stump said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
