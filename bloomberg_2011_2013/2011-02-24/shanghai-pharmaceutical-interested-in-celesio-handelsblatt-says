Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co.
is interested in buying a stake in  Celesio AG , a German drug
wholesaler,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing people it didnâ€™t name.  The Chinese company is in talks with Franz Haniel & Cie
GmbH, which holds a 54.6 percent stake in Celesio, the newspaper
said.  A partial fusion or a wider cooperation with Celesio is as
likely as a share acquisition, Handelsblatt said.  Shanghai Pharmaceuticals may also be interested in limiting
itself to a 30 percent stake due to financial constraints, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
