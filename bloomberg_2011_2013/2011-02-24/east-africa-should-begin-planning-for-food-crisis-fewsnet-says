East African countries, particularly  Kenya  and Somalia, should start preparing for food shortages,
the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network, known as
Fewsnet, said.  Parts of East Africa and the Horn of Africa already face
food insecurity because of a drought, Fewsnet said.  “Large-scale emergency assistance to address the current
food insecurity is needed; contingency planning, given the
possibility of a major crisis, should also be implemented,”
Fewsnet said in an e-mailed  statement  late yesterday from the
Kenyan capital, Nairobi.  The region suffered “extremely poor” rainfall in its
short October to December rainfall season, the famine unit said.
That drought may worsen and “lead to high and extreme levels of
food insecurity in the coming months,” the organization said.  East  Africa ’s March to May rainfall season is predicted to
be below normal, it said.  The United Nations World Food Program  needs 647 million
metric tons  of food for 6.2 million Ethiopians at a cost of
about $484 million, according to its website. In Kenya, the food
agency is seeking $226 million to purchase  255 million metric
tons  for about 2.1 million people, it said.  The WFP is trying to feed about 2.5 million Somalis, though
 625,000 live in areas  where local fighting make it too dangerous
for aid workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
