  Freddie Mac , the mortgage-finance
company operating under federal conservatorship, will seek $500
million in U.S. funds after the quarterly dividend payment on
the Treasury Departmentâ€™s stake exceeded fourth-quarter income.  The government-owned company reported a $113 million loss
for the three-month period that ended Dec. 31, Freddie Mac said
today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. That compared with a $6.5 billion loss for the same
period a year earlier.  Freddie Mac had a net-worth deficit of $401 million, which
was partly attributable to the $1.6 billion quarterly dividend
payment owed to the Treasury, which owns nearly 80 percent of
the McLean, Virginia-based firm, according to a  company
statement . Freddie Mac requested the $500 million in Treasury
Department aid to eliminate the deficit, according to the
statement.  Freddie Mac and its larger rival, Freddie Mac of McLean,  Virginia , own or guarantee more than half of U.S. home loans.
The companies have been hobbled since the credit crisis that
drove down  home prices  and fueled record foreclosures. They were
seized by the government in September 2008 amid mounting losses
that threatened them with insolvency.  U.S. policy makers are working on a plan to wind down the
companies and rebuild the U.S. housing system.  Taxpayer aid to  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac could total $224
billion by the end of 2012, of which $55 billion would be
returned in dividends to the Treasury, according to 2012 budget
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
