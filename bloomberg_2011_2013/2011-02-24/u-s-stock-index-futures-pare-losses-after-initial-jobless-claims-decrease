U.S. stock futures pared losses
after initial jobless claims decreased more than economists
estimated, helping the contracts recover from an earlier slide
triggered by a surge in  oil prices  amid  Libya ’s uprising.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring next
month slipped 0.2 percent to 1,302.3 at 8:55 a.m. in  New York 
after tumbling as much as 0.9 percent. Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures slipped 12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,082.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 22,000 to
391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would drop to 405,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.
Claims have fallen in three of the past four weeks, pushing down  the monthly average to the lowest level since July 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
