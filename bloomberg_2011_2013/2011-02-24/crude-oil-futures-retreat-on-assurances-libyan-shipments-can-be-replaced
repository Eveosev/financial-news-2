Oil dropped for a second day in  New
York  after the U.S.,  Saudi Arabia  and the  International Energy
Agency  said that they can compensate for any disruption to
Libyan shipments.  New York futures retreated from $103.41 yesterday, the
highest in 29 months after President  Barack Obama  said the U.S.
will be able to “ride out” a cut resulting from turmoil in
Libya. The crisis has trimmed supply by 500,000 to 750,000
barrels a day, according to the IEA. U.S. crude stockpiles rose
less-than-forecast last week, while fewer Americans than
projected filed first-time claims to collect jobless benefits.  “Saudi Arabia and the IEA assured they would be able to
release crude into the market to make up for shortfall,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in an e-mailed note today.
“With all the focus on Middle East oil supply, the slightly
better U.S. crude inventory data and falling jobless claims was
largely ignored.”  Crude for April delivery lost as much as 67 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $96.61 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $97.16 at 10:22 a.m. Sydney
time. Yesterday, it fell 82 cents to $97.28 after climbing to
$103.41, the highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008.  Prices are up 12.4 percent for the week, the biggest gain
since the week ended Feb. 27, 2009. Futures are 24 percent
higher than a year ago.  IEA Offer  Brent oil for April settlement rose 11 cents to $111.36 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange
yesterday, the highest close since Aug. 29, 2008.  The IEA said that it is ready to release emergency
stockpiles, if needed. The Paris-based agency, founded in 1974
in response to the Arab oil embargo, advises 28 developed
nations, including the U.S., Japan and  Germany .  Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries said they won’t wait for an
emergency meeting of the group to increase output, according to
a person with knowledge of producer-nation policy. Any extra
supply would be conditional on requests for more crude.  Libya, which pumps 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, is the
ninth-largest producer among the 12 members of OPEC, shipping
most of its crude and fuels across the Mediterranean to Europe.
The country has the largest reserves in  Africa .  Regional Unrest  Opponents of Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi consolidated
control over the oil-rich east while he clamped down on Tripoli,
using tanks to block highways and security forces to attack
residents, witnesses said. Foreign governments stepped up
efforts to extract their citizens from what fleeing Egyptians
said is turning into a bloodbath.    Libya  is the latest nation to be rocked by protests ignited
by the ouster of Tunisia’s president last month and fanned by
the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Unrest has
spread to  Iran , Bahrain, Yemen and  Algeria .  Total SA and OMV AG became the latest energy producers to
scale back Libyan operations, following Eni SpA, RWE AG and BASF
SE’s Wintershall unit. China National Petroleum Corp. said it
relocated 47 of its Libyan-based workers.  Countries in North Africa and the Middle East were
responsible for 36 percent of global oil output and held 61
percent of proved reserves in 2009, according to BP Plc, which
publishes its Statistical Review of World Energy each June.  U.S. Crude Stockpiles  U.S. crude supplies climbed by 822,000 barrels to 346.7
million last week, a sixth straight increase, a weekly Energy
Department report showed. A 1.1 million-barrel gain was
projected, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Gasoline inventories tumbled 2.8 million barrels to 238.3
million in the week ended Feb. 18, the first drop this year, the
department said. Analysts forecast that stockpiles advanced
850,000 barrels last week.  Applications for  unemployment insurance  decreased 22,000 to
391,000 in the week ended Feb. 19, the Labor Department said
yesterday. Claims have fallen in three of the past four weeks,
pushing down the monthly average to the lowest level since July
2008. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index rose to the highest
since April 2008, reflecting an improving jobs picture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
