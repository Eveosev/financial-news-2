  HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA ,
the Brazilian oil and gas company that raised about $1.5 billion
in an initial offering last year, said it may sell up to 50
percent of a pair of oil blocks in Namibia’s Walvis Basin.  The Rio de Janeiro-based company is also in talks to get a
loan next year from Brazil’s national development bank, known as
BNDES, HRT planning director Milton Frank told reporters today
in  Rio de Janeiro .  HRT has majority stakes in 21 exploration blocks in
Brazil’s Solimoes Basin and five offshore blocks in the African
nation. Two rigs will start drilling in the Amazon region in
March, and two more will start up in April or May, Frank said at
the Oil & Gas Outlook  Brazil  2011 conference in Rio today.  HRT’s partner at the Solimoes Basin, Petra Energia SA of
Brazil, is in talks with foreign and Brazilian oil companies to
sell its stake, Frank said. HRT will get a bonus if Petra sells
its stake at a premium to HRT’s 2010 initial public offering, he
said.  HRT fell 2.1 percent to 1,860 reais at 3:01 p.m. in Sao
Paulo trading. The stock has gained 58 percent since it first
started trading on Oct. 26, compared with a 3.5 percent drop for
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  HRT sold shares in an initial offering in October to help
fund exploration in the Amazon and off the coast of  Namibia . HRT
has said it will drill 12 wells at the Amazon this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
