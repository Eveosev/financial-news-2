Corn sowing probably will rise in
Europe and  North America  as higher prices prompt farmers to
plant more of the grain, according to  Vilmorin & Cie ., Europe’s
second-largest seed company.  “We’ll see a slight increase in the surface of corn, not
only in Europe but also in North America,” Chief Executive
Officer Adrian Huige said at a press conference in Paris today.  Corn futures jumped 81 percent on the Chicago Board of
Trade in the past 12 months, lifted by rising demand for the
grain from U.S. ethanol makers. Corn traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris advanced 75 percent in the same span.  Planting of corn in Europe this spring is forecast to
increase 4 percent to 5 percent, Chief Financial Officer Daniel
Jacquemond said at the conference.  “There is in principle a bit less area dedicated to
rapeseed,” Jacquemond said. “It’s not an arbitration to the
detriment of sunflowers or wheat.”  Basel, Switzerland-based Syngenta AG is  Europe ’s largest
seed company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
