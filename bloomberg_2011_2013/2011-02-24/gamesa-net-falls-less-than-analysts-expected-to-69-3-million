Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA’s 2010
profit fell less than analysts expected as the wind-turbine
maker reined in costs.  Net income slid 56 percent at 50.2 million euros ($69.3
million), the company said in regulatory filing. Analysts
expected profit of 49.3 million euros, according to the median
of nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. The Zamudio-based
company reduced its costs by more than 100 million euros to post
operating margin of 4.9 percent.  Turbine sales accelerated in the final months of last year
with 1,414 megawatts of turbines already ordered for 2011, 48
percent of the company’s guidelines for the year. The company
sold 2,405 megawatts of generators last year, in line with its
October projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
