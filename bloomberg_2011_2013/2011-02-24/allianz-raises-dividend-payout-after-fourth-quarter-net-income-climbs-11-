  Allianz SE , Europe’s biggest
insurer, raised its dividend after fourth-quarter profit climbed
11 percent and the company exceeded its full-year forecast.  Net income in the three months ended December increased to
1.14 billion euros ($1.6 billion) from 1.02 billion euros in the
year-earlier period, the company said today. That was in line
with the 1.15 billion-euro average estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Allianz proposed paying a dividend of
4.50 euros a share, up from 4.10 euros for 2009.  Allianz forecasts operating profit of 7.5 billion euros to
8.5 billion euros this year, Chief Executive Officer Michael Diekmann, 56, said at a press conference in Munich today. That
compares with 8.2 billion euros in 2010, which topped the upper
end of the insurer’s targeted range.  “The key question is, if earnings are so strong, at what
point will they say more about capital returns and plans for
acquisitions,” said Ben Cohen, a London-based analyst at  Collins Stewart  with a “hold” recommendation on the shares.  Allianz’s solvency ratio, a measure of the insurer’s
ability to absorb losses, rose to 173 percent in the quarter
from 164 percent at the end of 2009. That’s above the company’s
target range of 150 percent to 170 percent, indicating Allianz
has excess capital for possible takeovers or increased payouts
to shareholders.  The insurer is “still cautious regarding acquisitions”
before new Solvency II capital rules for the industry are
introduced in Europe, Diekmann said today.  Property and Casualty  Allianz shares fell 2.8 euros, or 2.7 percent, to 101.8
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt . They have gained 14.5
percent this year, beating the Bloomberg  Europe  500 Insurance
Index, which is up 11 percent over the period.  Solvency II, scheduled to be introduced in 2013, is
“developing into a threat to traditional retirement
provision,” and regulators “should not lose sight of the fact
that our business model has been operating without any hitches
during the crisis,” Diekmann said, echoing previous comments by
industry groups.  Allianz’s property and casualty insurance unit reported a 1
percent increase in net income to 804 million euros in the
fourth quarter. The unit’s spending on claims and other costs as
a percentage of premiums, also known as the combined ratio,
improved to 94.9 percent from 95.3 percent a year earlier. A
ratio above 100 percent means an insurer’s claims and costs
exceed premium income, giving it a loss from underwriting.  Life Insurance  Profit at the life- and health-insurance division declined
29 percent to 268 million euros after a one-time  tax refund 
wasn’t repeated. That missed the 461 million-euro average
analyst estimate.  Allianz’s asset-management unit, which includes  Newport
Beach , California-based  Pacific Investment Management Co. ,
posted a 51 percent profit gain to 292 million euros. For the
full year, total assets under management grew 26 percent to a
record 1.52 trillion euros, Allianz said.  The insurer held 8.1 billion euros in sovereign debt from  Spain ,  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  at the end of last year,
representing about 2 percent of its fixed-income investments.
Holdings in  Italy , where the insurer has a subsidiary, accounted
for 20 percent of Allianz’s 142.3 billion-euro portfolio of
government and government-related securities, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
