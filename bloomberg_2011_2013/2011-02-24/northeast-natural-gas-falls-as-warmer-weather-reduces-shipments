Natural gas for next-day delivery at
the Transco-Z6 hub in the U.S. Northeast fell the most in two
weeks as warmer-than-normal weather reduced demand for the
heating fuel.    Gas prices  at the hub, which delivers the fuel to the New
York City region, dropped as forecasts showed temperatures will
be above normal in the East in the next four days. Scheduled gas
delivery to  New York  fell 12 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Wholesale natural gas at Transco-Z6 declined 36 percent to
$5.2644 per million British thermal units on the  Intercontinental Exchange , the biggest drop since Feb. 10.  About 3.3 million dekatherms (3.21 billion cubic feet) of
gas were to be delivered to New York homes, down from
yesterdayâ€™s 3.74 million, Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residential use declined 10
percent to 35.1 million dekatherms, the lowest level since Nov.
22, according to the data.  Temperatures will be as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit above
normal in the U.S. East, Midwest and South through Feb. 28,
according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The high temperature in New York tomorrow will be 48
degrees Fahrenheit (9 Celsius), 4 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
