  Filtrona Plc , a U.K. maker of
plastic packaging and cigarette filters, said full-year profit
rose, helped by growth in higher margin divisions.  Net income for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to 47.7 million
pounds ($77.3 million) from 11.8 million pounds a year earlier,
the  Milton Keynes , England-based company said today in a
statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service. Revenue
climbed 10 percent to 489.6 million pounds.  “We are pleased with the company’s results in 2010 which
demonstrate that Filtrona has returned to a positive growth
path,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Harper said in the
statement. “The positive momentum from 2010 has continued into
the early part of the current year.”  Adjusted operating profit at Filtrona’s protection and
finishing products division climbed 81.1 percent from a year
earlier, and rose 22.1 percent at the porous technologies
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
