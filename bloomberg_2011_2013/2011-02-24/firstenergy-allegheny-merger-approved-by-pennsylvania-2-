  FirstEnergy Corp ., owner of
utilities in Ohio, Pennsylvania and  New Jersey , won approval
from Pennsylvania regulators for its $4.7 billion takeover of  Allegheny Energy Inc .  The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved the
merger with conditions by a 3-2 vote at its regular meeting
today, commission spokeswoman Cindy Page said in an e-mail.  The commission adopted rules that will require disclosure
of debt levels at what will become FirstEnergy’s four regulated
utilities in the state, according to an audio recording of the
meeting posted on the commission’s website.  FirstEnergy, based in Akron, Ohio, will review the board’s
written decision, spokeswoman Ellen Raines said today in a
telephone interview. In October, the company reached a
settlement with Pennsylvania consumer groups, unions and state
officials that would limit job cuts and freeze power-deliver
rates until 2012 in exchange for support of its deal to acquire
Greensburg, Pennsylvania-based Allegheny Energy.  Pennsylvania’s approval is the last regulatory hurdle,
Raines said. FirstEnergy expects to close the transaction by the
end of the first quarter, Chief Executive Officer Anthony Alexander said on Feb. 16 in an earnings conference call.  FirstEnergy rose 9 cents to $38.16 at 4:44 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading. Allegheny Energy rose 6 cents
to $25.18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
