China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) ,
the Chinese oil company that paid $7.11 billion for a stake in
 Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s Brazilian unit, may bid for exploration blocks
in the South American country when the government offers new
areas, a company official said.  Brazil is a “strategic” partner of China and Sinopec, as
the company is known, will look for new partnerships with
national and international oil companies in the country,  Ding
Jingjun , general manager in Brazil for Sinopec, said today at an
oil and gas  event  in Rio de Janeiro.  “The next 10 years will be of great strategic importance
for the development and growth of Sinopec,” he said, speaking
through an interpreter.  Brazil plans to sell exploration areas this year onshore
and off the coast of Northern Brazil where there has been little
exploration and production. The country is also organizing a
bidding round for areas in the so-called pre-salt region in deep
waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  The two largest discoveries in the Americas since 1976 are
in Brazil’s pre-salt region. State-controlled  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  is developing the Lula field, formerly known as
Tupi, which has 6.5 billion barrels in recoverable reserves.
Brazil is considering auctioning the Libra field, the country’s
largest discovery with up to 15 billion barrels.  Sinopec is Asia’s largest refiner.  In December,  Sinopec acquired  a 40 percent stake in
Repsol’s Brazilian unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
