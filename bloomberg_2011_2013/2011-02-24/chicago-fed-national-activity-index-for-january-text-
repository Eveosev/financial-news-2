Following is the text of the Chicago
Fed’s National Activity Index from the Federal  Reserve Bank  of
Chicago.  Chicago Fed National Activity Index  Led by declines in production-related indicators, the Chicago Fed
National Activity Index decreased to -0.16 in January from +0.18
in December. Three of the four broad categories of indicators that
make up the index made positive contributions in January, but they
were offset by continued weakness in the consumption and housing
category.  The index’s three-month moving average, CFNAI-MA3, edged up to -
0.10 in January from -0.14 in December, increasing for the third
straight month. January’s CFNAI-MA3 suggests that growth in
national economic activity was slightly below its historical trend.
With regard to inflation, the amount of economic slack reflected
in the CFNAI-MA3 suggests subdued inflationary pressure from
economic activity over the coming year.  The consumption and housing category’s contribution to the index
improved from -0.43 in December to -0.38 in January, the first
increase in five months. Housing starts increased to 596,000
annualized units in January from 520,000 in December, while
building permits fell to 562,000 annualized units in January from
627,000 in the previous month.  Production-related indicators made a contribution of +0.05 to the
index in January, down from +0.45 in December. Total industrial
production ticked down 0.1 percent in January after rising 1.2
percent in December. However, the Institute for Supply
Management’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index increased to
60.8 in January from 58.5 in December.  The sales, orders, and inventories category contributed +0.06 to
the index in January, up from +0.02 in December. The Institute for
Supply Management’s Manufacturing New Orders Index rose to 67.8 in
January from 62.0 in the previous month, reaching its highest
level since January 2004.  Employment-related indicators made a contribution of +0.11 to the
index in January, edging down from +0.15 in December. Total
nonfarm payroll employment rose by 36,000 in January after
increasing by 121,000 in December. However, manufacturing payrolls
rose by 49,000 in January, and the  unemployment rate  declined to
9.0 percent in January from 9.4 percent in December. Thirty-nine
of the 85 individual indicators made positive contributions to the
index in January, while 46 made negative contributions.  Thirty-nine indicators improved from December to January, while 45
indicators deteriorated and one was unchanged. Of the indicators
that improved, 12 made negative contributions. The index was
constructed using data available as of February 17, 2011. At that
time, January data for 52 of the 85 indicators had been published.
For all missing data, estimates were used in constructing the
index.  The December monthly index was revised to +0.18 from an initial
estimate of +0.03. Revisions to the monthly index can be
attributed to two main factors: revisions in previously published
data and differences between the estimates of previously
unavailable data and subsequently published data. The upward
revision to the December monthly index was primarily due to
revisions in previously published data.
