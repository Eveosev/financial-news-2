  China ’s yuan retreated from near a
17-year high as political uprisings in the Middle East prompted
investors to shun emerging-market assets and bolstered demand
for U.S. dollars.  All of Asia’s 10 most-used currencies excluding the yen
weakened and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares slumped to a
two-month low. The cost of crude oil in  New York  has jumped 18
percent this week, exceeding $100 a barrel for the first time in
more than two years, on concern supplies from the Middle East
will be disrupted as Libya teeters on the brink of civil war.
China imported 54 percent of the oil it used in 2010, industry
data show.  “Investors remain in a risk-off mode,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
The yuan’s decline was “cushioned by expectations” China will
add to its three interest-rate increases since the start of
October, she added.  The yuan slipped 0.1 percent to close at 6.5787 per dollar
in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. It has gained 3.8 percent since a two-year peg was
relaxed in June and touched a 17-year high of 6.5654 on Feb. 21.  The central bank set its daily  reference rate  0.05 percent
stronger at 6.5795. The currency is allowed to trade up to 0.5
percent on either side of the official rate.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  repeated a call
for China to allow its currency to appreciate faster at a
breakfast meeting with Bloomberg reporters yesterday in  Washington . There is growing support among nations for this to
happen and quicker gains are in China’s interest, he said.  China’s yuan may gain 5 to 7 percent this year, the China
Business News reported today, citing comments made at a forum by
former central bank adviser Fan Gang. The nation’s trade surplus
was $6.5 billion in January, the least in nine months, and the
gap narrowed in each of the last two years, official data show.  --Fion Li. Editors: James Regan, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
