The euro may rally further against
its U.S. counterpart and push through $1.40 after forming a
reverse head-and-shoulders pattern, according to Citigroup Inc.  “The path of least resistance remains for the euro to push
higher,”  Tom Fitzpatrick , chief technical analyst at Citigroup
in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “Interest-rate
expectations out of  Europe , combined with reasonable data, are
making people feel reticent to be as aggressive on the
downside.”  The common currency may extend to $1.4030 and $1.4283,
Citigroup said. A reverse head-and-shoulder pattern begun Feb. 2
was produced when price movements in a security formed three
bottoms, the middle of which is the deepest.  A close below $1.37 per euro would indicate a move higher
is unlikely, he said.  “A lot of people started this year focused on the event of
European sovereign risk and what that might mean for the euro-
dollar and that trade hasn’t worked,” Fitzpatrick said.
“Ultimately, we think it may even get higher than $1.4282.”  The euro rose as much as 0.5 percent to $1.3821 today, the
strongest in three weeks.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
