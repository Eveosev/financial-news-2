  Citigroup Inc ., the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Venu Krishnamurthy to head the high-
net-worth and affluent segments, replacing Deborah Doyle McWhinney, who vacated the position last week.  Brad Dinsmore, Citigroup’s U.S. retail-banking head, will
“consider other opportunities” within the firm, according to a
memo obtained by Bloomberg News, the contents of which were
confirmed by Sean Kevelighan, a spokesman for the bank. The
search for the head of the branch network is under way,
according to the memo.  Citigroup Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  appointed
Cecelia “Cece” Stewart from Morgan Stanley to run U.S. retail
and commercial banking in September as part of an overhaul of
consumer-banking operations. Stewart started her new job last
month.  Krishnamurthy is currently the global lead finance officer
at New York-based Citigroup’s private bank, and a former chief
operating officer for international operations at the private
bank, according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
