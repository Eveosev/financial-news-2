  EDP Renovaveis SA , the renewable-
energy arm of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said full-year profit declined 30 percent as costs increased
with new projects.  Net income fell to 80 million euros ($110 million) from 114
million euros a year earlier, the unit of Lisbon-based EDP said
today in a regulatory filing. Financial costs rose to 174
million euros from 72 million euros in 2009 as net debt
increased to 2.8 billion euros from 2.1 billion euros.  EDP Renovaveis is expanding its wind projects from  Europe 
to the U.S., tapping government support for alternative energy
development. EDP, which bought Horizon Wind Energy LLC of Texas
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 2007, says it’s the world’s
third-biggest wind-park operator.  The renewable-energy company expects installations in the
U.S. to slow because “prices are not there” to support more
new construction, Chief Executive Officer Ana Maria Fernandes
said today in  Madrid .  EDP Renovaveis installed 1.1 gigawatts of capacity in 2010
and in November said it’s adjusting the planned annual capacity
additions for 2011 and 2012 to 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts a
year.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are forecast to rise at an average annual pace of
about 30 percent from 2009 through 2012, according to a
presentation in May. Ebitda climbed 31 percent to 713 million
euros in 2010 as electricity output gained 32 percent.  EDP Renovaveis shares advanced 2.7 percent to 4.35 euros in
Lisbon. The stock has risen 0.3 percent this year, valuing the
company at 3.79 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
