The surge in defaults by U.S.
companies during the worst recession since the 1930s resulted in
greater recoveries for investors than in the previous two
economic slumps, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  The wave of defaults, which peaked at 14.6 percent in
November 2009 for U.S. speculative-grade debt, should have led
to “meager” recoveries on the billions of dollars in bonds and
loans, Moody’s said in a report today.  “The huge surprise was that the recovery rate was pretty
much average,” David Keisman, a New York-based Moody’s analyst,
said in a telephone interview.  Firm-wide recoveries were 54.7 percent for the 136 U.S.
non-financial corporate issuers that emerged from default
between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of this
year, according to the report. That compares with the historic
average of 55.5 percent based on data tracked by Moody’s since
1988, the credit ratings company said.  Recoveries also were above the 46.7 percent rate seen in
the 2001-2002 recession, and 47.7 percent in the default cycle
of 1990-1991, Moody’s said.  Investors recovered more in part because of the increased
use of distressed-debt exchanges, many of which were completed
by companies owned by private-equity firms, Keisman said.  Distressed-debt exchanges, which typically produce greater
recoveries than Chapter 11 proceedings or pre-packaged
bankruptcies, accounted for 26 percent of defaults in the
current cycle, Moody’s said. That compares with the historic
average of 16 percent since 1988, data from the report show.  Recoveries also were helped by the speed with which the
default rate fell, Keisman said.  Default Drop   About a year after reaching its peak, the U.S. speculative-
grade default rate dropped to 3.6 percent, below the historic
average of 5.2 percent, according to Moody’s. Such debt is rated
below Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by S&P.  As the U.S. government flooded the economy with stimulus
money, companies were able to improve their balance sheets by
refinancing debt and “it was easier to get exit financing,”
Keisman said.  Investors in loans recovered 77.2 percent in the current
default cycle, compared with an historic average of 80.3
percent, according to the report.  Bank loans accounted for a “much higher percentage” of
companies’ debt in the latest cycle, so the recovery rate was
lower than in previous recessions, Keisman said.  Senior unsecured bonds had a 42.6 percent recovery rate in
the latest cycle, compared with the historic average of 45.7
percent, Moody’s said.  The rate on subordinated debt was 27.6 percent in the
latest cycle; the historic average is 28.5 percent, according to
Moody’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
