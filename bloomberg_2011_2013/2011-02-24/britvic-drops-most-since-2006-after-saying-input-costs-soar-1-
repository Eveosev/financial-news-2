  Britvic Plc , the maker of Robinson’s
fruit drinks, fell the most in almost five years after saying
the price of key raw materials is rising at an “unprecedented”
pace and operating margins won’t improve this year.  Britvic fell 49 pence, or 12 percent, to 369 pence at the
4:30 p.m. close in  London , the biggest one-day decline since
March 2, 2006.  “The escalation in input costs comes after the completion
of this year’s price negotiation process, meaning that we do not
expect to be able to recover or mitigate in full the additional
input-cost increases we expect this year,” the company said in
a statement today. The rise “means we do not now expect any
operating profit margin improvement in 2011.”  Britvic estimates that input cost inflation will rise to
between 9 and 11 percent this year as the price of oil, sugar
and steel increase, the Chelmsford, England-based company said
in today’s statement. Britvic, which uses an oil-derived product
for its plastic bottles and steel for its cans, previously
estimated a rise of between 5 and 6 percent.  “These developments have occurred in the past few weeks,”
Paul Moody, Chief Executive Officer, said in a telephone
interview today. “We do remain confident that our 2011 profit
will be materially ahead of 2010. Our trading in all our
business units is strong.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
