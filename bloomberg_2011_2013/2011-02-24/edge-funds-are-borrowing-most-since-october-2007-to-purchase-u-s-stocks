  Hedge funds  increased their net
leverage in January to the highest level since October 2007, as
they took advantage of record-low borrowing costs to bet that
the U.S. equity rally will continue.  Debt at margin accounts at the New York Stock Exchange
minus cash and unused credit from margin accounts climbed to $46
billion, according to data released by NYSE yesterday. Hedge
funds had $290 billion of debt from margin accounts in December,
the largest sum since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed in
September 2008.  “It makes a lot of sense given the low cost of borrowing
and some equities’ valuations,” said Patrick Armstrong, who
helps manage $356 million in multiasset strategies at Armstrong
Investment Managers LLP in  London . “There is a capital-
structure arbitrage to be made by buying stocks with leverage.”  Money borrowed at NYSE can help gauge speculators’
bullishness toward stocks; peaks in loans to investors have
preceded market tops in the past. Margin debt peaked in February
2000 and in July 2007, before stocks plunged. Unused credit in
margin accounts rose to a record high of $386 billion in August
2008, about seven months before the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
rebounded from a 12-year low to start an 85 percent rally to
date.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies generate earnings per
share of 6.46 percent from the original investment, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That tops the yield on 10-year
treasury bonds by 303 basis points.  U.S. stocks have fallen this week as oil surged to $100 a
barrel after  Libya  suspended as much as two-thirds of its
production amid clashes between protesters and Libyan ruler
Muammar Qadaffi’s loyalists.  Clients had $105 billion available in NYSE cash accounts, a
sixth monthly increase and the highest sum since January 2009,
and $139 billion in available credit in margin accounts, the
NYSE data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
