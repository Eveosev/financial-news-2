PT Indo Tambangraya Megah, the
Indonesian unit of  Thailand ’s largest coal producer  Banpu Pcl ,
fell in Jakarta trading after reporting a decline in net income
that was below analysts’ estimates because of higher cost.  Indo Tambangraya fell 3.2 percent to 47,050 rupiah a share
as of 10:53 a.m. local time. The stock has risen about 18
percent in the past six months, outpacing the 11 percent gain on
the benchmark  Jakarta Composite index .  Jakarta-based Indo Tambangraya said 2010 profit declined to
$204.2 million last year, or 18 cents a share, from $335.6
million, or 30 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said
in a  statement  posted on the  Indonesia  stock exchange’s website
yesterday evening. That’s compared with an average estimate from
20 analysts in a Bloomberg survey of $307.6 million.  The company posted revenue of $1.7 billion last year,
compared with $1.5 billion in 2009. Cost of goods sold rose to
$1.1 billion from $938 million.  An increase in  oil prices  that climbed more than 15
percent last year boosted fuel costs at mining companies in
Indonesia, eroding profit. The Southeast Asian country is the
world’s largest exporter of tin and thermal coal.  “Mining costs and the cost of dispatch and demurrage were
seen as the main reason,” Ari Pitoyo, head of research at PT
Mandiri Sekuritas in Jakarta wrote in a note today. “We are
looking to see whether this is a one-off event or pattern to
continue in 2011.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
