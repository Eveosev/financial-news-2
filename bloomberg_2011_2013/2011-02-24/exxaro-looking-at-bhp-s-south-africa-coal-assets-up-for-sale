  Exxaro Resources Ltd ., South
Africa’s second-largest coal producer, said it’s studying coal
assets offered for sale by BHP Billiton Plc.  Some of the undeveloped reserves are near Exxaro’s own
projects, and could extend the life of its mines, General
Manager for Business Growth Ernst Venter told reporters in
Johannesburg today.  BHP’s South African energy-coal unit said last month it had
invited bidders for prospecting rights, saying “other industry
members would be better positioned” to develop the reserves.    Optimum Coal Holdings  Ltd., a South African producer of the
fuel, may also bid for some of the assets, Chief Executive
Officer Mike Teke said Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
