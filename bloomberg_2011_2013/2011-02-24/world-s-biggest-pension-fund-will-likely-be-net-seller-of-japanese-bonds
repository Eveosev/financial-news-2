Japan’s public pension fund, the
world’s largest, said it may become a net seller of bonds to
cover payments in the world’s most rapidly aging society.  The Government Pension Investment Fund, which oversees
117.6 trillion yen ($1.4 trillion), in September forecast that
it would sell 4 trillion yen in assets in the business year
ending March 31 to fund payouts. Sales may be less than that in
the year starting April as bonds reach maturity, said Takahiro Mitani, president of the fund, known as GPIF.  “We will likely be a net seller in the market,” Mitani, a
former executive director at the  Bank of Japan , said in an
interview in Tokyo yesterday. “We certainly have to come up
with an adequate amount” to pay pensions, he said, declining to
elaborate on the amount.  Sales by the fund, which helps oversee public pension funds
for Japan’s 37 million retirees, come as the first of Japan’s
baby boomers is set to turn 65 in 2012, making them eligible for
pension payments. In the year ended March 2010, GPIF raised 720
billion yen in part through selling assets to fund the payouts.
Almost 40 percent of Japan’s population will be older than  retirement age  in 2050, according to the statistics office.  The GPIF, historically one of the biggest buyers of
Japanese debt, held 82.4 trillion yen in domestic bonds, or 70
percent of its assets, as of September, according to the fund’s
latest quarterly  financial statement . That compares with 12.6
trillion yen in Japanese stocks, or 10.7 percent, 9.6 trillion
yen, or 8.2 percent, in foreign bonds and 11.5 trillion yen, or
9.7 percent, in overseas stocks, the report shows.  ‘Need to Sell’  GPIF is the biggest pension fund in the world by assets
under management, according to the Towers Watson Global 300
 survey  in September, followed by  Norway ’s government pension
fund.  The fund, which set out a  five-year investment plan  last
March, said it will continue to allocate about two-thirds of its
assets to domestic bonds, 11 percent to Japanese stocks, 8
percent to foreign bonds, 9 percent to overseas equities and 5
percent to short-term assets until March 2015.  “They need to sell, otherwise it’s not enough,” said
Takahiro Tsuchiya, a strategist at Daiwa Institute of Research
Ltd. “Because their allocation is already decided, they’ll
probably sell the asset classes that have increased in price.”  GPIF doesn’t plan to start investing in so-called
alternative assets such as commodities, real estate,
infrastructure, private equity or hedge funds because the risks
don’t suit its strategy, Mitani said.  ‘Too Early’  “It’s too early to get into alternative investments now,”
Mitani said. “Japanese investors are conservative and it’s hard
to justify to the public investing in asset classes such as
commodities, real estate and  hedge funds .”  After two years of losses following the onset of the global
financial crisis, the fund returned to profit in the business
year ended March 2010, as equity markets recovered globally,
Mitani said in the fund’s latest  annual report . The total return
for the last fiscal year was 7.9 percent.  Japan’s 10-year bonds declined for the first time in four
days today. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to
1.235 percent as of 9:21 a.m. at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent
security due December 2020 lost 0.131 yen to 99.693 yen. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Aging Society  Japan’s 10-year bond yield is the lowest in the world, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Japan’s gross domestic product
shrank an annualized 1.1 percent in the three months ended Dec.
31, the Cabinet Office said on Feb. 14, and  China’s economy 
overtook Japan’s as the world’s second largest for 2010.  People aged 65 or older will account for 29 percent of the
country’s population in 2020 and almost 40 percent in 2050,
according to the  statistics bureau . They accounted for 23
percent population at the end of 2010, the highest among the
Group of Seven countries, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with 12 percent in 1990.  About 8 million people, or 6 percent of the population,
were born between 1947 and 1949, regarded as the baby-boomer
generation in Japan, government data show.  The number of pensioners in Japan was 37 million in 2009,
an increase of 3.1 percent on the previous year, according to
the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare.  Pension fund payouts, which grew 2.8 percent from the
previous year, totaled 50.26 trillion yen in the year ended
March 2010, according to the health ministry. Of that, GPIF paid
3.76 trillion yen, or 7.5 percent, according to Yoshihiro Yumiba,
a director at the health ministry’s pension bureau.  Japanese pension funds posted the lowest annualized growth
among 12 countries between 2004 and 2009, at 2 percent in U.S.
dollar terms and unchanged in yen terms, according to the survey.  Brazil  reported the highest growth, 24 percent in dollars, the
report showed.  In terms of growth by assets among the top-20 funds in the
world between 2004 and 2009, Japan also came in last, increasing
3.5 percent, compared with  China  in first place at 40.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
