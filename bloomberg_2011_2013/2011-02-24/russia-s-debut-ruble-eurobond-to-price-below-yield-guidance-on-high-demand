  Russia  is raising 40 billion rubles
($1.4 billion) in its first sale of ruble-denominated Eurobonds 
as the rally in oil buoys investor support, according to two
bankers with knowledge of the transaction.  The bonds are being priced to yield 7.85 percent, they
said, declining to be identified before the deal is completed.
That’s lower than the bottom of the guidance range for 7.875
percent to 8 percent set yesterday.  The yield compares with the implied 7.83 percent for
domestic seven-year ruble bonds, based on the yield curve for
government notes using Micex Stock Exchange prices. Russia’s
ruble bonds due in August 2016, the longest maturity offered in
domestic auctions since the credit crisis began, are yielding
7.59 percent.  Russia postponed its international offering of ruble debt
in November after potential buyers demanded a higher yield than
the country was willing to pay amid  Europe ’s deficit crisis. The
government had been seeking to sell as much as $3 billion of
ruble Eurobonds with a maturity of as much as five years.  Oil, Russia’s main export earner, climbed as much as 5.4
percent today to $103.41 a barrel in  New York , the highest since
September 2008, on speculation Libya’s uprising reduced
supplies.  The sale was organized by Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holdings
Plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Renaissance Capital  and VTB Capital.
Russian government debt is rated Baa1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, its third-lowest investment grade rating, and one level
lower at BBB by  Standard & Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
