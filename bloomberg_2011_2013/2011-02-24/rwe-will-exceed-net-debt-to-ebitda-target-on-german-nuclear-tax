  RWE AG ,  Germany ’s second-largest
utility, said a tax on nuclear reactors means the company won’t
be able to keep net debt to three times or less adjusted
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.  “We are orientating ourselves toward an upper limit of
3.0,” RWE said today in its report on 2010. “In view of the
anticipated decline in earnings in the current year, however, we
will exceed this mark at first.”  RWE said its leverage factor was 2.8 last year.  Separately, the Essen, Germany-based company said it is
sticking to a policy of paying out between 50 percent and 60
percent of its recurrent net income in shareholder dividends.  To contact the reporter on this story:
