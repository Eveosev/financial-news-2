Bulgaria plans to cancel a 37
billion-yen ($452 billion) loan from the Japan Bank for
International Development to the Black Sea ports of Varna and
Burgas to build container terminals,  Dnevnik  reported.  The loan agreement was signed in 2008 with a seven-year
grace period and none of the money has been used so far because
construction of the terminals hasnâ€™t started, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The government decided to start talks about canceling the
loan agreement because  Burgas  has difficulty servicing an
earlier, 4.3 billion-yen loan from the same bank for a bulk-
cargoes terminal completed last year, the Dnevnik said.  The port has borrowed funds from other banks to repay the
first Japanese loan because business at the new terminal has
been slow and the Port Infrastructure Co. is thought likely to
to be unprofitable until 2028, when the first JBIC loan will be
repaid, Dnevnik said.  The government will lease the bulk-cargo terminal for 35
years, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
