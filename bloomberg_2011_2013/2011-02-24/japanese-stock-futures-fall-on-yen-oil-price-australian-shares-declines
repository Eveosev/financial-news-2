Japanese  stock futures  dropped as
the yen strengthened, reducing the outlook for exporters’
earnings, while oil retreated below $100 a barrel. Australian
shares fell.  American depositary receipts of Sharp Corp., a Japanese
maker of flat-screen panels that gets almost half of its revenue
outside Japan, fell 0.9 percent from the closing share price in
Tokyo. Those of Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest electronics exporter,
slid 0.3 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining
company, fell 0.7 percent in Sydney today.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,425 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,470 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,430 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index fell 0.2 percent today.  “The yen’s level against the dollar is a disadvantage for
exporters and it’s not fully digested yet whether the relief in
oil prices is real or not,” said Juichi Wako, a senior
strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “The surge in  oil prices  is not because of strong demand but because of
concern about supply. If  Saudi Arabia  increases output, that
concern will ease and the yen’s appreciation will halt.”  Crude Oil Retreats  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were unchanged
today. More than four stocks advanced  on the gauge for every
three that fell yesterday. Crude oil retreated yesterday from
the highest level since 2008 as concern eased that surging
energy prices will hurt the global economic recovery.  Crude oil for April delivery declined 0.8 percent to settle
at $97.28 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  after
assurances from the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the  International
Energy Agency  that they can compensate for any disruption of
Libyan shipments. The contract touched $103.41 yesterday, the
highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008.  The yen appreciated to as much as 81.63 against the dollar,
its highest level since Feb. 4, compared with 82.03 at the close
of  stock trading  in Tokyo yesterday. A stronger yen reduces
income at Japanese companies when overseas revenue is converted
into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.7 percent through
yesterday in 2011, compared with gains of 3.9 by the S&P 500 and
1.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.6 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.1 times for the
Stoxx 600.  Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications is
scheduled to announce Japan’s consumer prices in January at 8:30
a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
