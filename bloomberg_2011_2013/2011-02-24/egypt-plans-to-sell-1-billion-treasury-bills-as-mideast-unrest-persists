Egypt, whose economy is struggling
to recover from the unrest that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak 
this month, plans to sell 6 billion Egyptian pounds ($1 billion)
of treasury bills today.  The Ministry of Finance will offer 2.5 billion pounds of
182-day securities and 3.5 billion pounds of one-year notes at
the auction, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
average yield on 364-day bills gained 145 basis points to 12
percent at a sale on Feb. 21, the highest since November 2008.  “There is more scope for yields to keep rising,”  Alia Mamdouh , an economist at Cairo-based investment bank CI Capital,
said yesterday. “The worst is not totally over yet.”  The demonstrations that unseated Mubarak on Feb. 11 have
deterred investors and raised the government’s borrowing costs.
Unrest has spread to  Libya , where “credible” reports say that
1,000 people have been killed in clashes between forces loyal to
leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and the opposition, Italy’s Foreign
Minister Franco Frattini said yesterday.  The yield on the Egyptian government’s 5.75 percent bond
maturing in April 2020 rose 7 basis points to 6.9 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield
reached a record 7.2 percent on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
