  Vietnam ’s dong strengthened at gold
shops after Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung urged the central
bank to take control of unofficial trading in the currency and
ordered state-owned companies not to “hoard” dollars.  The premier asked the  State Bank of Vietnam  to “mobilize
all resources” to control the exchange rate in the unofficial
market at a meeting with ministers today in Hanoi. He also
demanded state-owned companies sell the greenback to the central
bank.  The dong advanced in the unofficial market, trading between
21,920 and 22,050 as of 3 p.m. at gold shops in  Ho Chi Minh City ,
compared with between 22,070 and 22,150 yesterday, according to
an information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  The dong dropped 0.3 percent to 20,890 per dollar,
according to prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The  State
Bank  of Vietnam set the daily  reference rate  at 20,683, the same
as yesterday, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of that rate.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bonds was unchanged
for a second day at 11.54 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
