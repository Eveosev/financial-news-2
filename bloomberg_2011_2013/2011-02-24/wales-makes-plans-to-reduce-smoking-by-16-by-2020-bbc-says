The Welsh Assembly Government has
drawn up plans to bring down smoking levels in Wales by 16
percent by 2020 with the aim of turning the country into a
“smoke-free society,” the British Broadcasting Corp. said on
its website, citing Chief Medical Officer,  Tony Jewell .   Measures being considered include banning smoking in
playgrounds and National Health Service properties, increasing
taxes on tobacco and starting a debate on smoking in cars
carrying children, the  BBC  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
