The European Commission’s plan to
allow imports of 300,000 metric tons of raw or refined sugar at
zero duty is “good news,” said Francisco Avillez, president of
the Portuguese Association of Sugar Refiners. Below are comments
he made by phone from Cascais,  Portugal , today.  “The approval of a fixed import quota at zero duty is good
news for the Portuguese refiners and refiners all over Europe.  “It’s not the 500,000 tons Portugal initially suggested,
but it should be enough at first. We will have to see how prices
in the international market develop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
