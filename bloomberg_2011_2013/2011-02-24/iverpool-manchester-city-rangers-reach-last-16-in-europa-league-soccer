Liverpool and  Manchester City 
advanced to the last 16 of soccer’s Europa League with home
wins, while an injury-time goal sent Rangers through following a
2-2 draw at Sporting Lisbon.  Dirk Kuyt’s header in the 86th minute gave Liverpool a 1-0
win over  Sparta Prague  last night, lifting the three-time winner
of  Europe ’s second-tier club competition into a matchup with
Sporting Braga in the next round.  “It was a hard game and we should have finished it off
earlier, but at the end of the day a win is all that counts,”
Kuyt told Channel 5.  Kuyt guided in Raul Meireles’s corner at Anfield as the
home side finally converted one of its nine efforts on target to
seal the victory, which followed last week’s 0-0 draw in  Prague .  Edin Dzeko scored twice as Manchester City beat Aris
Thessaloniki 3-0 after a scoreless opening match. Maurice Edu
bundled the ball into the net in the 92nd minute to give Rangers
the draw in  Portugal , sending the Glasgow club through on the
away goals rule after last week’s 1-1 tie in  Scotland .  “We came here intent on advancing and made life a little
bit difficult for ourselves but we found a way to pull ourselves
through in the end,” Edu said on Rangers’ website.  Ajax,  Bayer Leverkusen ,  PSV Eindhoven  and Zenit St.
Petersburg joined Liverpool as former champions moving into the
round of 16, which will be played March 10 and 17. Villarreal
ousted 1989 winner Napoli with a 2-1 home win.  Ajax Advances  Ajax beat Anderlecht 2-0 on two Miralem Sulejmani goals to
complete a 5-0 victory, while Leverkusen progressed 6-0 after a
2-0 win over Metalist Kharkiv. PSV defeated Lille 3-1 for a 5-3
aggregate win and 2008 champion Zenit  St. Petersburg  beat Young
Boys 3-1 to erase a 2-1 first-leg deficit.  Aiden McGeady’s goal in the final minute gave Spartak
Moscow a 1-1 draw and a 4-3 series win over  Basel , while Benfica
wrapped up a 4-1 victory over Stuttgart with a 2-0 win in  Germany .  Paris Saint-Germain advanced on away goals after a
scoreless draw with BATE Borisov following a 2-2 first leg. FC
Twente’s 2-2 draw with Rubin Kazan gave it a 4-2 aggregate win.  Dynamo Kiev completed an 8-1 rout of Besiktas with a 4-0
home win and Braga defeated Lech Poznan 2-0 to erase a 1-0 loss
in the opening game.  Porto advanced two days ago on away goals even after losing
1-0 at home to Sevilla, while  CSKA Moscow  completed a 2-1
aggregate win over PAOK Salonika the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
