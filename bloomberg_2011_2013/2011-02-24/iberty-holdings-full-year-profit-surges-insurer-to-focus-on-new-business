  Liberty Holdings Ltd ., the insurer
controlled by Africa’s largest bank, will focus on improving
sales and growing its existing African operations after profit
surged in 2010, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Hemphill said.  Profit excluding accounting adjustments and one-time items
surged to 2.6 billion rand ($366 million) last year from 135
million rand in the previous 12 months, Johannesburg-based
Liberty said in a statement today. While the insurer managed to
reverse clients cashing in their life policies during early
2010, new business contracted by 1.9 percent, reducing the
profit it makes from sales.  “We solved the persistency problem,” Hemphill said on a
conference call with reporters. The lower sales will be
outweighed by the benefits of writing higher quality business,
he said. “In the longer term, we will restore our margin.”  Liberty, which owns a property company, health insurer and
a money manager, will focus on existing businesses in 12 African
nations rather than going on an “acquisition hunt,” Hemphill
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
