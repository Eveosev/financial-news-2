  Imperial Oil Ltd . is working to
restore operations at its Sarnia refinery in Ontario after a
site-wide  power failure  around 10 a.m. local time today.  Several operational units were shut down as a result of the
power disruption, said Kate Jordan, a spokeswoman for the
Ontario Ministry of the Environment. At 11:35 a.m. the plant was
initiating restart procedures and attempting to bring the units
back online, according to Jordan.  One worker was treated at the plant for a minor burn on the
forehead and has returned to work, Jon Harding, a company
spokesman, said in a telephone interview. Three other workers
were evaluated on-site and are back to work, he said.  Power has been restored and workers are in the process of
returning the plant to normal operations, according to Harding.
He couldnâ€™t say if production was affected by the incident.  The refinery has a capacity of 121,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
