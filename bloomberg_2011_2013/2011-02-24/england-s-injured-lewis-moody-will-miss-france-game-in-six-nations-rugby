England flank forward Lewis Moody
will miss the Six Nations rugby match against  France  at
Twickenham in two days after a knee ligament injury flared up
again.  Prop Andrew Sheridan returns after getting over a back
problem. That’s the only change made by manager  Martin Johnson

role in the absence of Moody, who will have missed all three Six
Nations games so far.  Sebastien Chabal returns to the starting line-up for
France, at No. 8.  England and France top the standings, each having won both
their games so far, the only unbeaten teams in the tournament.  Also this weekend,  Italy  hosts Wales and Ireland travels
