  Nigeria  will sell 24 percent of its
49 percent equity stake in the Transcorp Hilton Hotel in Abuja,
the capital, through an initial public offer of shares scheduled
to be completed in September.  The sale is part of the government’s effort to reduce
“waste in public enterprises,” Bolanle Onagoruwa, director
general of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, the government’s
privatization agency, said today in an e-mailed statement from
the city.  Ten percent of the shares to be offered will be reserved
for workers of the 670-bed hotel, Onagoruwa said. The majority
of the hotel is jointly held by Capital Consortium and
 Transnational Corporation Plc , formerly called Nirmsco
Properties, according to the statement.  Lead Capital Markets Ltd. , based in the commercial hub of
Lagos, was named as the transaction adviser on the sale in April
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
