Chubu Electric Power Co., Japan’s
third-biggest energy utility, plans to invest as much as 800
billion yen ($9.8 billion) overseas by 2030, increasing its
foreign business by more than 10 times as domestic demand falls.  The Nagoya-based company will invest 300 billion yen in
overseas electricity generation and as much as 500 billion yen
in businesses to procure fuel and develop renewable energy, Yuji
Koyama, group leader of corporate planning and strategy, told
reporters in Tokyo today. Chubu Electric has invested about 60
billion yen overseas, he said.  Energy utilities are among Japanese companies that are
looking overseas as a falling population erodes demand for
services and products. Tokyo Electric Power Co.,  Asia ’s biggest
power utility, plans to invest as much as 1 trillion yen mostly
overseas by 2020, it said in September.  “Japan is facing a major period of transition,” Chubu
Electric said in an English-language statement on its website.
“In addition to problems with a declining birthrate, an aging
population, and energy resources, the country is also facing
responses to global warming and other such issues.”  Chubu Electric is targeting pretax profit of more than 50
billion yen from overseas business by 2030, a Japanese-language
 outline  said. It aims to have 10 gigawatts of electricity
capacity overseas, up from 1.1 gigawatts now.  Domestic Business  The company, which has 10 million customers in Nagoya, west
of Tokyo, and nearby regions, plans to increase annual
electricity sales from 123 billion kilowatts to 140 billion
kilowatts.  Chubu Electric wants to add as much as 4,000 megawatts of
nuclear capacity in Japan by 2030 as part of efforts to reduce
carbon dioxide emissions, it said. That’s in addition to a new
1,400 megawatt unit at its Hamaoka station, southwest of Tokyo,
it announced earlier.  The company is also aiming to increase natural gas sales
from 530,000 metric tons to 2 million metric tons, it said.  Details of the management plan, including timing of
investments and locations of projects, haven’t been decided,
Koyama said.  Chubu Electric said on Jan. 28 that net income for the nine
months to Dec. 31 rose 1.5 percent to 100 billion yen. The
company’s shares fell 1.3 percent today. It announced the plan
after the market closed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
