India’s benchmark stock index
tumbled the most in more than 15 months as food-price gains
accelerated and surging oil prices stoked concern inflation will
lead to higher  interest rates .    Tata Motors Ltd ., the nation’s biggest truck-maker, sank
7.8 percent, the most in 22 months.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd ., the
largest engineering company, slid 5.3 percent. An index of
wholesale farm-product prices rose 11.49 percent in the week
ended Feb. 12 from a year earlier, after climbing 11.05 percent
the previous week, the commerce ministry said today. Oil surged
to the highest in 30 months in  London  as  Libya ’s violent
uprising cut supplies from  Africa ’s third-biggest producer.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, slid
545.92, or 3 percent, to 17,632.41 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, the biggest drop since Nov. 3, 2009. The gauge has lost
7.9 percent since the central bank boosted interest rates on
Jan. 25 and raised its inflation estimate. The bank urged the
government to cut subsidies in its budget due Feb. 28 to curb
consumer demand.  “The geopolitical risk has flared up; if oil goes up, it’s
a big risk to the country,” said Amit Nigam, a  fund manager  at
BNP Paribas Asset Management  India  Pvt. in Mumbai, which manages
$1 billion in assets. “Investors would like to watch in the
budget how the finance minister manages the fiscal and current
account deficit, and sustains the pace of growth.”  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange slid
3.2 percent to 5,262.7. The index’s futures for March expiry
dropped to 5,286.90. February futures expire today. The BSE 200
Index retreated 3 percent to 2,163.72.  Third Worst  The Sensex has lost 14 percent this year, making it the
world’s third-worst performing benchmark index on concern
government measures to quell inflation will hurt economic
growth. The gauge has slumped 16 percent from a Nov. 5 record.  Companies on the measure are valued at an average 16.6
times estimated earnings, down from last year’s high of about
21.5 times in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Last year, India’s gauge climbed 17 percent, adding to the 81
percent surge in 2009.  Tata Motors, the biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar
Land Rover, plunged 7.8 percent to 1,054.4 rupees. The stock’s
March futures dropped to 1,063.5 rupees. Larsen & Toubro
decreased 5.3 percent to 1,516.4 rupees, while its March futures
settled at 1,526.40 rupees.    Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd ., the largest maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, retreated 3.8 percent to 616
rupees, its lowest close since August 30.  Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd ., the biggest carmaker, fell 1.5 percent to 1,174.55 rupees,
while its March futures settled at 1,142.70 rupees.  Higher Interest Rates  Central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao last month increased
interest rates for the seventh time since March to curb
inflation he expects to accelerate to a 7 percent rate by March
31. That’s up from an earlier assessment of 5.5 percent. The
central bank is aiming for an inflation rate of 4 percent to 4.5
percent.  The  Reserve Bank  of India reserves the right to change its
policy stance anytime, according to the copy of a speech by
Subbarao circulated today.  “Our biggest challenge has been to manage the tension
between the demand of growth and inflation,” he said in a
speech to the graduating students at a university in the eastern
state of Orissa. “We are sensitive to the need for supporting
growth as economic growth is a necessary condition for poverty
reduction.”  ‘Crazy Jumble’  Rising  oil prices  due to the Middle East crisis is a
concern that Indian equities have not fully priced in yet, Sunil Singhania, head of equities at Reliance Capital Asset Management
Ltd., India’s biggest money manager, said on Feb. 22.  Higher fuel prices push up food costs by boosting transport
rates. That will worsen the “crazy jumble” of items including
erratic weather patterns and underproduction of staple foods due
to rising affluence that are pushing up prices in developing  Asia , Mark Matthews, a Singapore-based strategist at Macquarie
Group Ltd., said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.  The wholesale-price index for food articles averaged
approximately 17.2 percent in the past year. Milk, eggs, fish
and meat were the main contributors to food inflation in recent
years as rising incomes prompted consumers to buy more protein-
based products, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this month.    State Bank of India  Ltd., the biggest lender, sank 3.4
percent to 2,528.65 rupees, its third day of declines.  ICICI
Bank Ltd . slumped 5.4 percent to 951.35 rupees, extending this
year’s drop to 17 percent.  Housing Development Finance Corp .,
the biggest mortgage lender, slipped 4.7 percent to 616.8
rupees, while March futures settled at 620 rupees.  Workers March  Thousands of workers from across India marched toward the
country’s parliament in  New Delhi  yesterday protesting rising
food costs, low wages and job insecurity.  “What we are seeing today is pre-budget nervousness,”
said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities
Ltd., the brokerage arm of India’s second-largest private
lender. “At the same time, things on the global front are
jittery. We have been cautious for the past 1 1/2 months, and
have recommended clients to be light on equities.”    Hero Honda Motors Ltd ., the biggest motorcycle maker,
advanced 1.5 percent to 1,494.75 rupees, extending yesterday’s
5.9 percent jump. The company’s parent received approval from
the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to raise 45 billion
rupees from overseas investors.  Overseas Investment    Bain Capital  LLC and the Government of Singapore Investment
Corp. will invest 45 billion rupees in Hero Group, Bloomberg UTV
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  Jennifer Lewis, a spokeswoman at GIC, couldn’t be reached
immediately for a comment on her office or mobile phone. Alex Stanton at Stanton Public Relations & Marketing said in an e-
mail Bain Capital declined to comment. Hero Group’s spokesman
Ashwani Sharma did not immediately respond to a call and e-mail
questions on the investments.  Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. slumped 17 percent to 170.15 rupees,
the most since October 2008, after U.S. regulators restricted
imports from a facility supplying drugs to Pfizer Inc. The stock
posted the biggest decline on the BSE 200 Index.  Overseas investors bought a net 924 million rupees ($20.5
million) of Indian equities on Feb. 22, paring total outflow
from equities this year to 66.1 billion rupees, according to
data on the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of
India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
