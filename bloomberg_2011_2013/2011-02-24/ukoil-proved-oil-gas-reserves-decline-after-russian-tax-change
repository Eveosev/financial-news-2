OAO Lukoil’s proved oil and gas
reserves fell 1.4 percent last year as  Russia  increases mineral
extraction tax rates.  Proved oil and natural-gas reserves stood at 17.3 billion
barrels of oil equivalent to U.S. Securities and Exchange
standards at the end of last year, Lukoil, Russia’s second-
largest oil producer, said today in a statement. That compares
with 17.5 billion barrels a year earlier, according to the
company’s website.  New laws that adjust future mineral extraction tax rates
cut proved reserves by 118 million barrels, Lukoil said.  Oil resources fell 2.8 percent to 13.3 billion barrels.
Natural-gas reserves rose 3.3 percent to 23.6 trillion cubic
feet on the development of the Bolshekhetskaya Depression and
the beginning of drilling at Pyakyakhinskoye field.  Lukoil said its share of the early oil phase of the West
Qurna-2 project in  Iraq  has been included in the proved
reserves. The Moscow-based company’s press office declined to
comment on the size of the Iraqi addition to reserves or on
potential reserves in West Africa.  As much as 10.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent of
resources may be moved into reserve categories as projects draw
closer to development, gas utilization programs progress and
technology makes harder to produce resources recoverable, Lukoil
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
