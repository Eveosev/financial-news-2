  China  Vanke Co., the country’s
biggest publicly traded developer, said it’s “confident” sales
will stay above 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) in 2011 for a
second year.  “We’re always confident about the target,” Liu Aiming,
Vanke’s executive vice president, told reporters at a property
forum in Shanghai. “It will also depend on government
policies.”  Vanke posted 108 billion yuan revenue for 2010, becoming
the first Chinese developer to post annual sales exceeding 100
billion yuan, and reaching a target it had set for 2014. The
Shenzhen-based developer said on Feb. 10 it expects a “sharp”
drop in sales this month after revenue in January more than
tripled to 20.1 billion yuan.  China last month raised the minimum down payment for
second-home purchases, told local governments to set price
targets on new properties and introduced taxes for residential
properties in  Shanghai  and Chongqing to curb speculation. The
central bank also raised  interest rates  this month for the third
time since mid-October.  Vanke fell 0.6 percent this year, compared with the 1.9
percent advance in a measure tracking property stocks on the
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. The country’s January new
home prices rose from a year earlier in all but two of the 70
cities monitored by the government, the government said Feb. 18.  A number of Vanke’s December transactions were booked in
January, boosting the figure, while February, which had the
Lunar New Year holiday, is usually a low season for property
sales, Tan Huajie, the company’s board secretary, said in a Feb.
10 statement. Chinese markets were closed for the holiday from
Feb. 2 to 8.  Vanke will “proactively” develop social housing, or
affordable homes, Liu said today. Future project developments
will include these homes, he said.  --Bonnie Cao. Editors: Linus Chua, Andreea Papuc  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
