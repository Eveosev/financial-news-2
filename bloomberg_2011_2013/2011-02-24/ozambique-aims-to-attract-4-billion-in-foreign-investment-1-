     Feb. 24 (Bloomberg) ---  Mozambique  aims to attract $4
billion in foreign direct investment this year, double last
year’s figure, the head of the state-run  Investment Promotion
Center  Lourenco Sambo said today.  The southern African nation expects investment in
agriculture, mining, energy and infrastructure from  India , China
and Europe, Sambo said in an interview in Maputo,  Mozambique ’s
capital.  A government delegation led by Prime Minister Aires Ali is
expected to visit India next month on a trade mission to woo
investors, he said.  Agriculture will be the priority of the mission, Sambo
said, so Mozambique can improve productivity to reduce its
dependence on imports and bring down food prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
