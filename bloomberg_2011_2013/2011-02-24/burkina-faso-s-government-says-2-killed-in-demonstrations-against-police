Burkina Faso’s government said two
people were killed in a demonstration against the police in
Koudougou, the country’s third-biggest city.  The statement was issued by the country’s council of
ministers late yesterday.  The demonstrations by students began on Feb. 22 after the
death of Justin Zongo two says earlier in police custody. Zongo
died of meningitis, Marie Odile Bounjoungou, the country’s
education minister, said on national television.  “We walk to claim justice for one of our companions who
was arrested and tortured by policemen after a fight between him
and a class member,” Boureima Oudraogo, a demonstrator, said in
an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
