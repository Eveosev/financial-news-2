  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, missed analyst
estimates as losses from Ireland rose and profit from  investment
banking  fell.  The net loss for 2010 was 1.1 billion pounds ($1.78
billion) compared with a loss of 3.6 billion pounds in 2009, the
Edinburgh-based bank said in a statement today. That was worse
than the 406.5 million-pound median loss estimated by 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Irish loan-losses almost doubled
to 1.16 billion pounds, while operating profit at the investment
bank fell by 2.2 billion pounds. RBS shares dropped.  “We have much work still to do and there are significant
obstacles still to overcome,” Chief Executive Officer Stephen Hester said in the statement.  Hester, 50, forecast the bank would return to profit in
2011 after three years of losses. The bank, which received a
45.5 billion-pound taxpayer rescue, the biggest in the world,
has cut about 27,000 jobs and reduced its assets by 948 billion
pounds since Hester replaced  Fred Goodwin  during the financial
crisis of November 2008.  “They’ve missed estimates with another anaemic revenue
performance at the investment bank and a spike up in loan losses
at the non-core division,” said  Ian Gordon , an analyst at Exane
BNP Paribas in London. “The legacy issues for the group are
large and enduring. It isn’t a pretty picture.”  RBS dropped 3.6 percent to 45.6 pence at the close in
London, the biggest decline in the FTSE 350 Index of Britain’s
five biggest banks.  Bad Loans  Overall, bad-loan provisions fell to 9.3 billion pounds
from 13.9 billion pounds, the bank said. The rise in Irish bad
loans reflected the country’s “deteriorating economic
environment,” RBS said.  RBS also took a 1.1 billion pound after-tax charge for its
use of the  Asset Protection Scheme , a government-backed
insurance program for toxic debt.  Operating profit at the investment bank led by John Hourican was 3.5 billion pounds compared with 5.7 billion pounds
in the year earlier. The unit’s revenue fell to 7.9 billion
pounds, from 11.1 billion pounds a year earlier.  Barclays Plc , a
U.K.-based competitor, this month said 2010 pretax profit almost
doubled at its investment banking unit, even as revenue dropped
25 percent to 13.33 billion pounds.  RBS said it would continue to target a 15 percent return on
equity, whereas Barclays this month cut its target to 13 percent
or more.  First Bonus  Operating profit at the U.K. consumer bank rose almost
sixfold to 1.37 billion pounds compared with 229 million pounds
in 2009, the bank said.  “The fact that U.K. retail did so well should be great
read-across for Lloyds” which reports full-year earnings at 7
a.m. in London tomorrow, said Arturo de Frias, head of banking
research at Evolution Securities Ltd. in  London .  Hester will take his first bonus since joining the bank,
accepting a 2 million-pound all-stock payout. He refused
payments for 2008 and 2009. The bank posted a loss of 24.3
billion pounds in 2008, the biggest in U.K. corporate history.  The overall 2010 bonus pool will be less than 950 million
pounds, a 27 percent reduction from 2009.  “Pay per head is significantly down,” Hester said in a
call with journalists today. “Total pay is also down and the
number of heads are up. We’ve got more people with less pay.”  Stake Sale  RBS, 83 percent owned by the government, has to sell its
insurance operations, which includes Direct Line and Churchill,
by 2013 to comply with a European Union ruling following its
receipt of state aid. The bank had about 195 billion pounds of
risky assets insured by the government under the Asset
Protection Scheme at the end of the fourth quarter, down from
205 billion pounds in the previous quarter.  “Our state support is reducing big time” through dramatic
declines in liquidity support, Hester said on a call with
journalists.  The RBS CEO also echoed comments made last month by U.K.
Financial Investments, which manages taxpayer bank holdings,
saying the government was unlikely to start selling its stake
before the  Independent Commission on Banking  delivers its final
report in September and that the process could take several
years.  “There are likely to be several tranches and they will
likely be split a couple of years apart,” Hester said at a
press conference today. “It will be a multi-year process.”  Qatar’s prime minister yesterday held out the possibility
of buying stakes in RBS and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc  during a
visit by Britain’s Prime Minister  David Cameron .  To contact the reporter on this story:
