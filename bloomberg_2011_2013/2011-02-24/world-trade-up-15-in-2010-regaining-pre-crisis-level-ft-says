Global trade has regained its pre-
crisis level, fuelled by emerging marketsâ€™ rising exports and
imports, the Financial Times reported, citing a report by the
Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, a research institute based
in the Netherlands.  A measure compiled by the institute shows that the volume
of goods traded rose 15.1 percent last year, after declining by
13 percent in 2009, the newspaper said.  Goods traded in December exceeded the previous record, set
in the spring of 2008, the FT said.  Growth was fastest in  Asia  and Latin America, U.S. import
and export growth was near the world average and the euro area
lagged behind, according to the report, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
