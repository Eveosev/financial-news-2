  Acerinox SA , the world’s largest
stainless-steel producer, posted a full-year profit after a loss
the year before and said the current quarter will be stronger
than the previous three months thanks to stronger demand.  Net income was 122.7 million euros ($169.3 million) in
2010, compared with a loss of 229.2 million euros the year
before, the Madrid-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. Sales rose 50 percent to 4.5 billion euros.  As the global economy improves, Acerinox said a recovery in
demand has been “sustained” since the end of last year and the
first-quarter results will be “notably better” than in the
previous three months. Inventory levels in the market will
“allow better  price levels  to be consolidated,” it said.  Acerinox will pay a second dividend on 2010 earnings of 10
euro cents a share on April 5, it said.  For the fourth quarter, net income was 25.2 million euros,
compared with the profit of 6.4 million euros it reported a year
ago for the fourth quarter of 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
