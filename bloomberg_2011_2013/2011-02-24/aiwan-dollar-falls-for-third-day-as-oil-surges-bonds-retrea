Taiwan’s dollar weakened to more
than a six-week low as the turmoil in  Libya  pushed up oil prices,
raising concern global economic growth will slow. Bonds fell.  The currency fell for a third day after global funds sold
$987.4 million more local shares than they bought in the past
four days, according to exchange data. Crude oil reached $100 a
barrel yesterday in  New York  for the first time since October
2008 and has jumped 15 percent this week. Five-year  government
bonds  fell for the first time since Feb. 16.  “Basically, the Libya situation is still the dominant
theme for the currency,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based bond
trader at Polaris Securities Co. “There was a clear resistance
at 1.05 percent for the five-year bond yesterday and investors
are retreating to the sidelines for the time being, judging by
the low volumes.”    Taiwan ’s dollar declined 0.6 percent to NT$29.760 against
its U.S. counterpart as of its 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.801,
the weakest level since Jan. 11.  The yield on the 1 percent bond due January 2016 increased
two basis points to 1.084 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The rate reached 1.055 yesterday, the lowest
level since Jan. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
