  Abertis Infraestructuras SA , Spain’s
biggest toll-road operator, reported full-year profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as revenue climbed, boosted by traffic on
highways outside  Spain .  Net income rose 6.1 percent to 662 million euros ($909
million) from 624 million euros in 2009 as sales increased 5.2
percent to 4.11 billion euros, the Barcelona-based company said
in a  statement . That compares with an average 659.2 million
euros in profit and 4.07 billion euros in sales from analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company plans a final dividend of 30 euro cents a
share, for a total gross dividend of 60 cents, Abertis said.  Abertis declined as much as 0.7 percent to 14.40 euros and
was down 0.3 percent as of 9:16 a.m. in Madrid trading. That
pared the stock’s gain this year to 7.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
