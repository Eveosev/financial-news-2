A potential extension of the rally
in Brent crude oil prices may boost the euro, pound, Australian
dollar and Canadian dollar against their U.S. counterpart,
according to a technical strategist at BNP Paribas SA.  “There is a modest positive correlation” between the
Brent crude price and the currencies, New York-based Andrew Chaveriat wrote in an e-mailed report dated yesterday.  A “bullish technical bias” for Brent that’s pushing it
toward $120 a barrel may boost the euro to near $1.40 and send
the pound toward $1.6460, he wrote. It may see the Australian
dollar reach “resistance” at about $1.02 and  Canada ’s dollar
strengthen toward 98.20 cents per  U.S. dollar , he said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
