  Kohl’s Corp ., the Wisconsin
department-store chain that has lured shoppers away from rivals
like Sears Holdings Corp., rose the most in three months in  New
York  trading after declaring its first-ever dividend.  The quarterly dividend will be 25 cents a share, the
Menomonee Falls-based company said today. Bloomberg analysts
predicted a dividend of 13 cents. Kohl’s also said profit in
2011 will be as much as $4.25 a share, compared with the $4.35
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mansell also more than
tripled Kohl’s stock-buyback program to $3.5 billion, citing the
chain’s financial strength. The retailer, which has almost 1,100
stores, competes with chains like Sears and discounter Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. in the U.S., where consumers are spending again as
the economy recovers.  “What they’re saying is that ‘we’re not going to waste the
money, we’re going to return a good portion of it,’” said  Joel Levington , managing director of corporate credit for Brookfield
Investment Management Inc. in New York.  Kohl’s buyback authorization amounts to more than 20
percent of the shares outstanding, based on yesterday’s closing
price. The shares climbed $1.78, or 3.4 percent, to $53.80 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The gain was
the biggest since Nov. 17.  Kohl’s, which has slowed its store openings and cut  capital
expenditures  by more than half from two years ago, will have
enough cash to repurchase shares and pay the dividend without
hurting its  credit rating , Levington said.  The chain also predicted first-quarter earnings of 68 cents
to 73 cents a share. That compares with the 71-cent average of
predictions compiled by Bloomberg. Kohl’s net income in the
period ended Jan. 29 rose 14 percent to $493 million, or $1.66 a
share, from $431 million, or $1.40, a year ago. Sales rose 6.3
percent to $6.04 billion in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
