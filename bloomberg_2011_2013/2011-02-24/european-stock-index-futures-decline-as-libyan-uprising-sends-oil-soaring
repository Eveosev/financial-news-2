European stocks sank for a fifth
day, extending the longest losing streak since October, as
Libya’s violent uprising sent oil soaring to the highest level
in 29 months.    RWE AG , Germany’s second-largest utility, slid 5.2 percent
after saying profit will fall this year.  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc  dropped 3.6 percent after posting a wider-than-
estimated loss. Porsche SE tumbled 11 percent after saying its
merger with  Volkswagen AG  will probably be delayed.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.6 percent
to 280.56 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , the lowest level
this month. The measure has declined 3.6 percent since peaking
at the highest since August 2008 last week and is on course for
the biggest weekly drop since July, trimming this year’s advance
to 1.7 percent.  The Libyan revolt “is the opening of Pandora’s box,” said
Charles Dautresme, senior strategist at Axa Investment Managers
in Paris, which oversees $710 billion in assets. “We don’t know
how long the situation will last and that’s creating
uncertainty. For stocks, the impact has gone beyond just those
with business there or those dependent on oil.”  Opponents of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  consolidated
control over cities in the oil-rich east while he clamped down
on Tripoli, using tanks to block highways and security forces to
attack residents, witnesses said. The fighting is the most
violent yet seen in six weeks of popular uprisings across the
Middle East and North Africa, which have already unseated
longtime rulers in Tunisia and Egypt.  Oil Surges  Crude in New York surged to the highest level in 29 months
as  Libya ’s uprising reduced supplies from Africa’s third-biggest
oil-producing country. Oil for April delivery reached $103.41,
the highest intraday price since Sept. 29, 2008 on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  National benchmark indexes fell in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX Index retreated 0.9 percent,
while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 and France’s CAC 40 slipped less than
0.1 percent.  European stocks pared losses after a U.S. report showed
initial applications for  unemployment benefits  decreased more
than forecast last week.  RWE dropped 5.2 percent to 49.39 euros, the biggest decline
in 10 months. The utility said profit will fall about 30 percent
this year because of a tax on its nuclear  power plants  and
“stagnating” power prices.  RBS, Porsche  RBS retreated 3.6 percent to 45.60 pence as Britain’s
biggest government-controlled lender reported a 2010 net loss of
1.1 billion pounds ($1.8 billion). Analysts had expected a 406.5
million-pound loss, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Porsche preferred shares plunged 11 percent to 55 euros,
the biggest drop since July 2009. The sports-car maker said a
probe by prosecutors in Stuttgart into allegations of share-
price manipulation by two former board members will probably
delay a planned merger with Volkswagen.  Volkswagen preferred stock declined 3 percent to 112.45
euros. Automobile shares in the Stoxx 600 dropped 2.3 percent
for the biggest slide among 19 industry groups.    Britvic Plc , the maker of Robinson’s fruit drinks, tumbled
12 percent to 369 pence after saying the price of key raw
materials is rising at an “unprecedented” pace and operating
margins won’t improve this year.  Vallourec, Capita    Vallourec SA , a French producer of steel pipes for the oil
and gas industry, fell 6.6 percent to 72.55 euros as profit
missed estimates. Fourth-quarter net income rose 6.7 percent to
107.7 million euros ($148 million), trailing the 131 million-
euro average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.    Capita Group Plc , which provides a criminal records service
for the U.K. Home Office, climbed 7.2 percent to 718 pence for
the biggest gain in the Stoxx 600 after saying it’s bidding for
and winning more orders than in 2010 as the economy recovers
from recession.    Credit Agricole SA  advanced 5.2 percent to 12.39 euros.
France’s third-largest bank had a narrower-than-estimated
quarterly loss as earnings at the investment-banking business
helped cushion provisions for bad loans at its Greek unit.    Celesio AG  rose 3.2 percent to 19.88 euros after
Handelsblatt reported that Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co.
is interested in buying a stake in the German drug wholesaler.
The Chinese company is in talks with Franz Haniel & Cie GmbH,
which holds a 54.6 percent stake in Celesio, the newspaper said.  Rainer Berghausen, a spokesman at Celesio, and Dietmar
Bochert, a spokesman for Haniel, declined to comment. Shanghai
Pharmaceuticals also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
