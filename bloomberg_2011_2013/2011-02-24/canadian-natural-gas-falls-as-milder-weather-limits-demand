Canadian natural gas for March
delivery fell as forecasts for milder weather in the eastern
U.S. reduced demand for exports of the heating fuel.  Gas declined 2 percent as temperatures may be normal or
above-normal in the U.S. Northeast and Great Lakes region from
March 1 through March 10. Temperatures may as much as 7 degrees
above normal in the Northeast, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s
 EarthSat Energy Weather  in Rockville,  Maryland .  The U.S. Northeast is the second-largest consuming region
for Canadian gas exports, trailing the Midwest.    Alberta  gas for March dropped 7.5 cents to C$3.265 per
gigajoule ($3.17 per million Btu) as of 3:40 p.m.  New York  time,
according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the
exchange is shipped to users in  Canada  and the U.S. Northeast,
Midwest and West Coast.  Natural gas for March delivery fell 10.7 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $3.793 per million Btu on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The settlement price was the lowest since Oct. 27.  Gas at Niagara, Ontario, near the border with New York,
where gas is traded for the Northeast, rose 7 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.40 per million Btu, according to the  Intercontinental Exchange .  Alliance Gain  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
gained 2.23 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $4.0524 per million
British thermal units on the exchange. Alliance is an express
line that can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the
Midwest from western Canada.  Available capacity on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Foothills system
on the border of Alberta and British Columbia was 776 million
cubic feet, 14 million more than yesterday. The system was
forecast to carry 2.08 billion cubic feet today, about 73
percent of capacity.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, the biggest gas-
gathering network in the nation, was 16 billion cubic feet as of
2:55 p.m. in New York. Volume on the system decreased by 1.2
billion cubic feet in the past four hours.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 3.77 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.82 billion cubic feet.  The U.S. Northeast and Midwest account for about 64 percent
of Canada’s gas export, according to the National Energy Board
of Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
