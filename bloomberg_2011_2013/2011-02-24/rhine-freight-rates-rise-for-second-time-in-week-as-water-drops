The cost of shipping oil products on
the Rhine River rose for the second day after falling water
levels reduced the potential volume of fuel on barges.  The cost of shipping gasoil to Duisburg,  Germany , from
Rotterdam or Amsterdam rose to 4.75 euros ($6.54) a metric ton
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up
from 4.50 euros on Feb. 22 and 4.25 euros at the beginning of
the week.  The barge clearance level at Kaub, west of  Frankfurt , was
1.72 meters (5.6 feet) yesterday, down 26 percent since the
beginning of the month. The Rhine is Germany’s main waterway,
used by refineries and chemicals companies including BASF SE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
