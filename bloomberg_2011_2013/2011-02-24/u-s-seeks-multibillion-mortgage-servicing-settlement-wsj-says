The Obama administration is seeking
a multibillion dollar settlement from banks in a case covering
mortgage loan-servicing, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The settlement would force banks to pay for reductions in
loan principals, the Journal said. Any unified settlement would
need approval from federal regulators and statesâ€™ attorneys
general, some of whom want a settlement of more than $20
billion, the Journal said.         The banks, including  Bank of America Corp ., JPMorgan Chase &
Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co ., declined to comment, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
