  RWE AG , Germany’s second-largest
utility, said it will miss growth targets at its  renewable
energy  and oil and natural gas production units because of
reduced investment and project delays.  RWE Innogy, the Essen, Germany-based company’s renewable
energy unit, plans to have 4.5 gigawatts of power generation
under construction or in operation by 2014, later than RWE’s
original goal of reaching the figure as early as next year, the
utility said today in a statement.  RWE Dea, the oil and gas production division, will raise
annual output to 70 million barrels of oil equivalent by 2016,
compared with a target of reaching the level as early as 2015,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
