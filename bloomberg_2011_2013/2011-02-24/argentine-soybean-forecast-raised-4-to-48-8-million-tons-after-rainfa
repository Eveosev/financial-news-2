  Argentina ’s soybean crop, the
world’s third largest, may be 4 percent higher than last week’s
forecast at 48.8 million tons after recent rainfall, the Buenos
Aires Cereals Exchange said.  Rain in the past week has boosted yields, the exchange said
today in its weekly crop report on its website. Last week the
exchange forecast the soybean crop would reach 47 million tons.  Argentine farmers produced a record 55 million tons of
soybeans last year. Output was pared in the current season by
dry weather between November and January. Harvesting of the
oilseed starts next month and runs through June.  The country’s corn crop, which is being harvested, is
forecast to reach 19 million tons, the exchange said. Argentina
is the world’s second-largest exporter of the grain, behind the
U.S. The U.S. and  Brazil  are the two largest soybean exporters.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose 2.25 cents, or 0.17
percent, to close at $13.29 a bushel at 1:15 a.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. On Feb. 9, the oilseed reached $14.5575, the
highest since July 2008, amid rising global demand. The
commodity has gained 39 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
