Ethanol futures gained for a second
day in  Chicago  as refiners blended more of the fuel to take
advantage of its discount to gasoline.  The grain-based additive rose 0.6 percent after an Energy
Department report showed production of conventional gasoline
blended with ethanol increased 6.4 percent to 4.96 million
barrels a day last week, the highest since Dec. 24. Blenders
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol mixed
with gasoline.  “Ethanol just had a firm tone most of the day,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Inc. in  Des Moines ,
Iowa. “The blender’s spread is in there. The refiners, the
blenders are taking notice.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 1.5 cents to
$2.486 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are 45
percent higher than a year ago.  The biofuel traded at a 23.07-cent discount to gasoline,
based on today’s closing prices for the two fuels.  Gasoline for March delivery climbed 0.18 cent to $2.7167 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.50 a gallon and in Chicago the additive rose 6.5
cents, or 2.7 percent, to $2.47, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  increased 5 cents, or 2 percent, to
$2.56 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.535.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 7 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 1 cent on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
