  Arminio Fraga , a former president of
Brazil’s central bank, has warned that some new  consumer lending 
in the country needs greater scrutiny, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Fraga.  “I am concerned about the fast loan growth and I’m curious
to see what will happen with the quality of these loan books,”
Fraga said, the newspaper reported. “If I had my old job, I
would send my troops all over the place to check it out,” Fraga
said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
