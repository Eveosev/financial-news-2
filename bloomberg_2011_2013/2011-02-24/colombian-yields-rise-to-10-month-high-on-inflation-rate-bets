  Colombia ’s peso fell to a one-week
low as unrest in  Libya  cut into demand for higher-yielding
emerging-market assets.  The peso sank less than 0.05 percentage point to 1898.75
per U.S. dollar, and earlier weakened as far as 1,905.75 per  U.S. dollar , its lowest level since Feb. 17.  “Investors have been seeking refuge in other currencies
such as the dollar, yen and Swiss franc,” said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Cia. de
Profesionales de Bolsa SA. “There has been a lot of volatility
in the market in the last few days.”  Libya’s  Muammar Qaddafi , who has lost control of much of
his country’s oil-rich east, made an appeal on state television
for citizens to end violence as his forces stepped up a
crackdown on opponents and more than 100 people were reportedly
shot dead. The fighting is the most violent yet seen in six
weeks of popular uprisings across the Middle East and North
Africa, which have already unseated longtime rulers in Tunisia
and  Egypt .  Trading volume was low ahead of tomorrow’s central bank
meeting, according to Santana.  Colombia’s central bank will leave its overnight lending
rate unchanged at a record low 3 percent at its Feb. 25 monetary
policy meeting, according to 21 of 22 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Interbolsa SA predicts an increase of 25 basis points
to 3.25 percent.  A survey published yesterday by Citigroup Inc.’s local unit
showed economists predict Banco de la Republica will lift the
rate to 3.25 percent in March.  Colombia’s peso bonds rose, erasing earlier declines.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.34 percent,
according to Colombia’s stock exchange. The bond’s price rose
0.075 centavo to 116.779 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
