  OMV AG ’s refineries in Austria,
Germany and Romania receive about 20 percent of their crude
supply from Libya, Jaap Huijskes, head of exploration and
production, said.  “Libya accounts for around about 20 percent of the
feedstock for Austria, but also overall for the group it’s a
similar percentage,” according to a transcript of a conference
call yesterday. The shortfall can be “easily compensated” with
crude from Kazakhstan, Nigeria, from the North Sea, he said.  OMV is among companies including Eni SpA and  Total SA  that
are reducing production in Libya amid violent anti-government
protests in Africa’s third-largest crude producer. Loading crude
onto tankers is proving difficult, Huijskes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
