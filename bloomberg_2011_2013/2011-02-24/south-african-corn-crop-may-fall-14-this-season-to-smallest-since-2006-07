  South Africa , the largest corn
producer on the continent, may produce its smallest harvest in
four years this season after prices of the grain fell, leading
farmers to grow other crops, the  Crop Estimates Committee  said.  The corn harvest may fall 14 percent to 11.04 million
metric tons, from 12.82 million tons last season, Marda
Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said by phone today
from  Pretoria . The estimate lags the 11.5 million-ton median
forecast of 14 traders surveyed by Bloomberg this week.  South Africa’s white corn crop may fall 19 percent to 6.36
million tons, and its yellow corn harvest might drop 6.1 percent
to 4.68 million tons, Scheepers said.  Plantings this season fell 14 percent after last year’s
bumper crop left farmers with a surplus for which they’re
struggling to find buyers. Generic white corn futures prices
fell as much as 39 percent to 1,019 rand ($144.35) a metric ton
last year, the lowest in more than four years.  Farmers switched to growing other crops including oilseeds,
with the country’s sunflower seed harvest  forecast  to surge 65
percent to 808,420 tons this season, Scheepers said. Farmers
will also probably produce 729,050 tons of soybeans, 29 percent
more than last year, she said.  South Africa’s corn stockpiles rose 19 percent to 5.22
million tons at the end of January from a year earlier, the
South African Grain Information Service said yesterday.  The nation shipped 86,679 tons of white corn to  South Korea 
earlier this month in what was probably the country’s first
shipment to that country, Anna Enslin, SAGIS’s general manager,
said on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
