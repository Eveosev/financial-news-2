The  Nigerian Stock Exchange , where
foreign investors hold 68 percent of shares, wants to increase
the proportion of securities held by locals, Interim
Administrator Emmanuel Ikazoboh said.  “The reason is that confidence has not grown for our
people to start buying as much as foreign investors,” Ikazoboh
said at a capital market conference in Lagos. “It is an issue
we need to address.”  The exchange plans to establish an alternative market for
small and medium enterprises and for private placements within
three months, Ikazoboh said. The bourse is also monitoring the
performance of stock prices to decide whether to alter the
current cap of five percent on changes permissible on share
prices, he said.  The country’s benchmark equity index climbed for eight
straight years until 2008, when it plunged 46 percent and fell a
further 34 percent in 2009 amid a banking crisis sparked by
loans to equity speculators. The gauge has increased 26 percent
since the start of 2010 as the central bank bailed out some of
the lenders, fired eight chief executive officers and set up a
company that has bought bad debts from them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
