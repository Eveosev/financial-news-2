The U.K. government sent a Royal Air
Force transport plane to the Libyan capital of Tripoli to rescue
British citizens fleeing the violence of the week-old uprising.  The plane was sent from Malta to pick up people who were
unable to get onto  charter flights , said a U.K. government
official traveling with Prime Minister  David Cameron  in Muscat,
Oman. A second plane is on standby, said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity in line with government policy.  There are fewer than 500 British citizens remaining in
Libya. About 300 are in the capital and about 100 are in the
eastern city of Benghazi, which is controlled by rebels opposed
to leader Muammar Qaddafi’s 41-year rule. The C-130 plane and
charters should be sufficient for Tripoli residents, the
official said.  The Royal Navy frigate HMS Cumberland is waiting for
permission to dock at Benghazi to get Britons there, the
official said. Cameron yesterday said “there is no higher
priority” than getting British citizens out of  Libya .  To contact the reporter on this story:
