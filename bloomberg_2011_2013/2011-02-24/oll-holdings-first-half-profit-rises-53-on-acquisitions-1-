  Toll Holdings Ltd ., Australia’s
biggest trucking company, posted a 53 percent increase in first-
half earnings because of acquisitions and new contracts with
companies including Woolworths Ltd. and BHP Billiton Ltd.  Net income rose to A$164 million ($165 million), or 23.3
cents a share, in the six months ended Dec. 31, from A$107
million, or 15.3 cents, a year earlier, Melbourne-based Toll
said in a statement today.  Toll’s resources unit, which transports supplies for mining
companies, is benefiting from demand for Australia’s raw
materials, helping offset the effect of stalling consumer demand
on its retail transport business. The company has made more than
60 acquisitions since 2000 and added six in the half-year
period.  “The outlook for the retail environment over the next six
months is far from clear,” the company said in the statement.
“The resources sector offers strong growth opportunities over
the medium and long term as major infrastructure projects are
developed both in  Australia  and throughout  Asia .”  Toll fell 3.2 percent to A$6 at the 4:10 p.m. close of
Sydney trading, paring this year’s gain to 4.7 percent.
Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.8 percent.  Earnings before interest, tax and amortization at the
company’s global resources division rose 10 percent to A$50.4
million.  Earnings from international freight forwarding more than
tripled to A$24.6 million from A$7.4 million a year earlier.
Freight forwarding involves transporting goods along with
related activities such as  customs clearance , warehousing and
ground services.  The express business, which includes courier services for
freight and documents, had a 33 percent rise in earnings to
A$94.9 million, bolstered by its acquisition of Japan’s Footwork
express.  To contact the reporter on this story:
