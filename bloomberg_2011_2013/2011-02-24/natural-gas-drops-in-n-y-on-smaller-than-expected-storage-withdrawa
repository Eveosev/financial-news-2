Natural gas futures dropped to the
lowest price in almost four months after a government report
showed that U.S. stockpiles fell less than expected last week.  Gas slipped 2.7 percent after the Energy Department
reported inventories declined 81 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Feb. 18 to 1.83 trillion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg
users showed an expected decrease of 84 billion.  “Right now there are likely to be some bearish pressures
in the market based on the fact of today’s withdrawal being
slightly below the consensus estimate,” said Jason Schenker,
president of Prestige Economics, an energy advisory company in
Austin,  Texas . “With the onset of warmer weather, there’s going
to be a sharp decrease in seasonal demand.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 10.7 cents to $3.793
per million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Oct. 27.  The March contract expired today. The more actively traded
April contract slid 6.4 cents, or 1.6 percent, to settle at
$3.872 per million Btu.  Gas stockpiles last week were 3.2 percent below the five-
year average compared with 6.3 percent the previous week,
today’s report showed. A deficit to year-earlier supplies
narrowed to 2.6 percent from 6.9 percent.  Gas inventories may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet by the
end of March, down from 1.662 trillion a year earlier, the
Energy Department estimated on Feb. 8 in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook.   U.S. Outlook  The government “expects near-record-high inventories to
continue through most of 2011,” the Energy Department said in
the report.  “The market is not yet convinced that it’s reached a level
where gas can become no cheaper,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst with Citi Futures Perspective in  New York , in a note to
clients.  Normal or above-normal temperatures are likely across most
of the continental U.S. from March 1 through March 5, according
to MDA Federal Inc.’s EarthSat Energy Weather in Rockville,  Maryland .  The low temperature in New York on March 4 may be 43
degrees Fahrenheit (6 Celsius), 11 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .
The low in  Chicago  may be 29, 2 degrees above normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
