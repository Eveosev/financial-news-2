  Hellenic Petroleum SA , Greece’s
largest refiner, said it uses 10 percent to 12 percent of Libyan
crude oil at its refineries.  “There is no material impact,” Chief Executive Officer
John Costopoulos said today on a conference call with analysts.
The company is studying possibilities of obtaining so-called
sweet, or low-sulfur, crudes from West Africa should there be a
supply loss from the North African nation, he said.  Libya is the latest nation to be rocked by protests ignited
by the ouster of Tunisia’s president last month and fanned by
the Feb. 11 fall of Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak . Libya
ships most of its crude and oil-products to Europe and the
Mediterranean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
