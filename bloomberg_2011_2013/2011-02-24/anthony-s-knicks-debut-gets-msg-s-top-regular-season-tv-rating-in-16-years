Carmelo Anthony’s debut produced the
highest television rating for a regular-season  New York  Knicks
game on the MSG Network in 16 years and four times this season’s
average.  Anthony, acquired two days ago in a trade with the  Denver
Nuggets , scored 27 points last night to lead the Knicks to a
114-108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks at Madison Square Garden
in New York.  The 6.75 rating, according to Nielsen Co. data, was the
highest for a regular-season Knicks game on the network since
March 28, 1995, when  Michael Jordan  scored 55 points in his
return to New York following his first retirement from the  National Basketball Association .  “Last night’s Knicks game was a defining moment at the
Garden,” Mike Bair, president of MSG Media, said today in a
statement.  More than 500,000 households watched the game on MSG in the
New York area, and the rating easily topped this season’s
previous network high of 3.61 for the Knicks-Boston Celtics game
on Dec. 15. The combined television rating for that game against
the Celtics on the MSG and ESPN networks was 6.27.  The average rating for 52 Knicks games on MSG this season
is 1.62, the network said in a news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
