Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
phone unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG , had an unexpected fourth-
quarter profit after an income tax credit partially offset an
industry tax the government levied to plug budget holes.  Net income dropped to 7.5 billion forint ($37.6 million)
from 10.2 billion forint a year earlier, the company said in a
statement to the Budapest bourse today. The average estimate of
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of 9.9
billion forint.  Magyar Telekom, which reported a loss of 7.3 billion forint
before income taxes, booked 17 billion forint in tax credits for
the quarter. Management has proposed cutting the 2010 dividend
to 50 forint per share from 74 forint in 2009 because of the 27
billion forint paid out last year in an extra tax on the
telecommunication industry. The company booked the full expense
for the fourth quarter.  “The telecom industry tax left a painful imprint on
earnings,” Budapest-based Equilor Befektetesi Zrt. said in an
e-mail today. The government, under pressure to reduce the  budget deficit , has said the tax will be in effect for at least
another two years.  Shares Rise  Magyar Telekom shares rose 10 forint, or 1.9 percent, to
549 forint at 10:48 a.m., the highest in two weeks.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization may decline 4 percent to 6 percent this year after
dropping a less-than-forecast 5.5 percent in 2010, Chief
Executive Officer Christopher Mattheisen said in the earnings
report.  The Ebitda forecast excludes the effects of the telecom
tax. Ebitda dropped 14.5 percent in 2010, including the special
tax. Revenue this year may drop 3 percent to 5 percent from 2010
levels, Mattheisen said. The company also said it plans to cut  capital expenditures  by 5 percent this year.  Hungary’s economy grew 1.2 percent last year, compared with
a contraction of 6.7 percent in 2009. Mobile usage increased in
the residential market, with the number of mobile subscribers
returning to growth last year after dropping in 2009, the
company said.  “These results also support our view that the Hungarian
economy has started to recover and we continue to see positive
signs in customer spending,” Mattheisen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
