  NYSE Euronext  said all its European
stock indexes are running normally after a technical fault
caused their levels to be incorrectly displayed for nearly an
hour following the start of trading.  Equity benchmarks in  France , Belgium,  Portugal  and the
Netherlands were affected by the outage, according to a
statement on Euronext’s website. Trading of stocks and futures
continued as normal, company spokeswoman Caroline Tourrier said
by phone from Paris.  NYSE Euronext, which is also the parent company of the New
York Stock Exchange, has agreed a $9.5 billion takeover by
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Boerse AG, a deal that would create the
world’s largest owner of equities and derivatives markets.
Trading on NYSE Euronext’s markets takes place on its Universal
Trading Platform.  NYSE Euronext’s fault today wasn’t as lengthy as one that
knocked out the Italian stock exchange on Feb. 22. Borsa
Italiana, owned by  London Stock Exchange Group Plc , started 6
1/2 hours late as “technical issues” prevented buying or
selling. Consob, Italy’s securities market watchdog, wrote to
Borsa Italiana and LSE seeking clarification on the problems
asking the exchanges to strengthen management and technology to
ensure that the disruption isn’t repeated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
