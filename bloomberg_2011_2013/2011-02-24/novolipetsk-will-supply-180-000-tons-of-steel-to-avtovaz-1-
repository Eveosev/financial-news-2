OAO Novolipetsk Steel, Russian
billionaire  Vladimir Lisin ’s steelmaker, agreed to supply an
annual 180,000 metric tons of cold-rolled steel to OAO AvtoVAZ,
the country’s largest automaker, part-owned by  Renault SA. (RNO)   The companies signed a one-year contract including 36,000
tons of galvanized steel, they said in separate statements
today. Prices will be linked to global rates for the alloy,
while shipments will begin in April, they said. Novolipetsk’s
current price list for steel products would value the contract
at more than $150 million, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Novolipetsk stepped in after AvtoVAZ failed to agree on
prices with its traditional steel supplier, billionaire Alexei Mordashov’s OAO Severstal. AvtoVAZ is appealing to the antitrust
watchdog and Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  over price gains.  Russian steelmakers are benefiting from rising local demand
as Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  supports car purchases through
a domestic version of the U.S.’s “cash for clunkers” program.
Russian car sales may increase to 2.24 million vehicles this
year, after gaining 30 percent last year to 1.9 million autos,
according to the Association of European Businesses.  To contact the reporters on this story:
