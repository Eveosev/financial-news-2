The Serbian government will increase
public-sector wages 2.95 percent in April instead of a
previously planned 5 percent adjustment for inflation,  Vecernje
Novosti  newspaper reported, citing a government source it did
not name.  The lower than expected increase is seen as the only
“sustainable solution” for the budget following the latest
review of the country’s 3 billion euro ($4.12 billion) bailout
arrangement with the  International Monetary Fund  even though
inflation is in double digits, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
