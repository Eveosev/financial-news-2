  Georgia Gulf Corp .,  North America ’s
largest maker of vinyl construction products, said it’s planning
to start paying a “meaningful” dividend as it forecasts a
second straight year of positive free cash flow.  “At the right time, I’m sure we will institute a
dividend,” Chief Financial Officer Greg Thompson said today in
an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York . “We just
want to make sure that when we do it, it’s a meaningful dividend
but also one that we can sustain in trough operating
conditions.”  The dividend may resume later this year or possibly in
2012, Thompson told investors today at a meeting in New York.  Georgia Gulf stopped paying a quarterly dividend of 2 cents
a share in 2008 as a collapsing housing market slashed demand
for the Atlanta-based company’s vinyl construction products and
chemicals. Free cash flow, which was negative in 2008 and 2009,
was $138.1 million last year. The company today forecast $60
million to $120 million of free  cash flow  this year.  Georgia Gulf rose $2.20, or 7.5 percent, to $31.37 as of
4:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  The low price of U.S. natural gas relative to oil is
boosting profit even as the domestic housing market continues to
struggle, Chief Executive Officer Paul Carrico said in the
interview. Cheaper gas makes the company’s polyvinyl chloride,
known as PVC plastic, more competitive outside the U.S.  A barrel of oil, which topped $100 a barrel today in New
York trading, is 25 times more expensive than 1 million British
thermal units of natural gas, the highest ratio since August
2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Higher  oil prices 
could ultimately slow economic growth, he said.  “It was good for us when it was 15- or 20-to-1,” Carrico
said. “We don’t need it to be 30-to-1.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
