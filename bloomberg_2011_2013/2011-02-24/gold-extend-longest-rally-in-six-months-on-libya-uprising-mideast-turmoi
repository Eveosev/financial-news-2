Gold futures rose, extending the
longest rally in six months, as mounting turmoil in  Libya 
spurred demand for an investment haven.  Crude oil climbed to the highest in 29 months amid
estimates that Libya’s output has dropped by as much as two-
thirds. Popular uprisings toppled of governments in Tunisia and  Egypt . Demonstrations have occurred in Yemen and Bahrain,
prompting  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter, to
introduce moves intended to increase  living standards .  “There’s still a lot of geopolitical tension and unrest,
so gold is going to continue to work its way higher,” said  Matthew Zeman , a metal trader at LaSalle Futures Group in  Chicago .  Gold futures for April delivery rose $1.80 to settle at
$1,415.80 an ounce at 1:30 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
metal was up for the eighth straight session, the longest
advance since early August. Earlier, the price reached
$1,418.80, the highest since Jan. 3. The commodity has gained 29
percent in the past year, climbing to a record of $1,432.50 on
Dec. 7.  Gains were limited as some investors sold the metal during
the rally. The 14-day relative-strength index topped 70 for the
second straight day, a signal to some traders that the price is
poised to fall.  “Gold has had a nice, uninterrupted run the past week, so
it’s not surprising to see a pause or some profit-taking,”
Zeman said.  Gold held in exchange-traded products rose 0.6 metric ton
to 2,015.39 tons yesterday, rebounding from the lowest level
since June 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from 10
providers. Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December.
Silver ETP assets advanced 61.39 tons to 14,713.45 tons, the
highest level since Jan. 21, data from four providers show.  Silver, Palladium  Silver futures for May delivery fell 12.4 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $33.18 an ounce. On Feb. 22, the price reached
$34.315, the highest since March 1980. The commodity has doubled
in the past 12 months. The metal climbed to a record of $50.35
in January 1980.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $3.40, or 0.4
percent, to $779.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for April delivery gained $10.10, or 0.6
percent, to $1,786.80 an ounce.  Palladium and platinum, mostly used in pollution-control
devices in vehicles, dropped in the previous two days as fuel
costs climbed.  “Part of the reason we’ve seen such deep turndowns is
attributed to the fact that $5-a-gallon gasoline is seen as not
quite the stuff that robust automotive sales are made of,” said
Jon Nadler, an analyst at Kitco Inc. in  Montreal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
