The  Atlanta Thrashers  signed General
Manager Rick Dudley to a four-year contract extension,
solidifying the National Hockey League team’s front office as it
seeks a new owner.  Financial terms of the contract weren’t disclosed in a news
release.  Dudley’s new contract follows the signing of defenseman
Dustin Byfuglien, the team’s second-leading scorer, to a five-
year, $26 million pact. The team is also close to signing
captain Andrew Ladd, who leads Atlanta forwards with 22 goals,
to an extension, the Atlanta Journal-Constutition reported.  Michael Gearon Jr., one of Atlanta’s co-owners, recently
 told  the Atlanta newspaper that the franchise might be forced to
move if  attendance  doesn’t improve and new investors can’t be
found.  To contact the reporter on this story: Michael Buteau in Atlanta
