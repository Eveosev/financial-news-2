The yen lost the most against the
euro since February amid speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will add
further stimulus next week even as global growth accelerates.  Sterling had its biggest weekly gain versus the dollar in
15 months on bets the  Bank of England  may refrain from further
monetary easing, while Brazil’s real slid as its central bank
cut  interest rates . The dollar fell against most major peers
before the  Federal Reserve  begins a two-day policy meeting April
24. The euro rose amid stronger-than-forecast German data.  “We are expecting the Bank of Japan to take action next
week, and further movements in the yen will depend how
aggressive they are,” said Eric Viloria, senior currency
strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in New York. “It’s not
going to have the same impact it did when they announced the
inflation target and expanded stimulus by 10 trillion yen ($123
billion). Every time a bank takes action you see a diminishing
impact on the currency.”  The yen dropped 1.9 percent to 107.79 per euro yesterday in
 New York  in the biggest weekly loss since the five days ended
Feb. 24. It  touched  an almost two-month high of 104.63 on April
16 before tumbling. The Japanese currency fell 0.7 percent
versus the dollar, the most in a week since March 16, to 81.52.  Europe’s shared currency strengthened 1.1 percent to
$1.3219, from $1.3078 on April 13, in its biggest jump in almost
two months. The euro rallied this week after falling below $1.30
on April 16 for the first time since February as Spanish
borrowing costs touched a 2012 high, fueling concern Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis was spreading.  ‘Remarkably Good Shape’  The euro gained after the Bundesbank said April 17 the
German economy,  Europe ’s largest, is in “remarkably good
shape” and the ZEW Center for European Economic Research’s
index of investor and analyst expectations  rose  to the highest
since June 2010. The Munich-based  Ifo institute ’s gauge of
German business confidence unexpectedly increased to 109.9 this
month from 109.8 in March, data showed yesterday.  The 17-nation currency broke above its 50-day moving
average against the dollar yesterday, touching its strongest
level in two weeks, $1.3228, even as  Spain ’s 10-year  yields 
reached above 6 percent. The debt touched 6.16 percent four days
earlier, the highest since December. Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  is struggling to convince investors he can get Spain’s
finances under control.  ‘Greater Barometer’  “When you get ongoing increases to German investor
confidence, that is a greater barometer to the health of Europe
than rising Spanish bond yields,”  Andrew Wilkinson , chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said on
April 17.  The euro gained yesterday against the dollar and the yen as
governments committed more than $430 billion in fresh money to
the  International Monetary Fund  to help it protect the global
economy against Europe’s debt turmoil.  The yen dropped against all of its 16 most-traded peers
except the Brazilian real before the Bank of  Japan  meets on
April 27. The bank is “committed” to monetary easing, Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said April 18 in a speech in New York. Deputy
Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said that day the BOJ is “committed
to implementing additional easing measures, if deemed
necessary.” He spoke in a speech in Okayama, western Japan.  Shirakawa and his board unexpectedly expanded bond
purchases on Feb. 14 while setting a 1 percent inflation goal.  “Easing from the BOJ could come as soon as next week, or
it could be two or three months out,”  Aroop Chatterjee , a
currency strategist at Barclays Plc in New York, said on April
19. “BoJ dovishness is here to stay, and they are the only
major central bank that is continuing to ease.”  Biggest Loser  Brazil ’s real was the biggest loser against the dollar this
week after the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate
by three-quarters of a percentage point to 9 percent. It also
signaled further rate cuts may be made because inflation risks
“remain limited.”  The real tumbled 1.8 percent to 1.8724 per dollar. It
touched 1.8935, the weakest level since November, on April 19.  Sterling gained after minutes of the Bank of England’s
April meeting released this week showed policy maker  Adam Posen 
ended his push for further stimulus. Posen joined the majority
of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee in seeking no
change to the 325 billion-pound ($525 billion) asset-purchase
target, minutes of the April 4-5 session showed.  The pound climbed 1.7 percent, the most since January 2011,
to $1.6122. It gained 0.7 percent to 81.97 pence per euro.  Canadian Currency  The Canadian dollar had the biggest advance versus its U.S.
counterpart in seven weeks. Policy makers said on April 17 an
interest-rate increase “may become appropriate” as the economy
recovers. The  Bank of Canada  also upgraded growth forecasts. The
currency advanced 0.7 percent to 99.24 cents to the greenback.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to measure the greenback against six major trading partners,
fell 0.9 percent this week to 79.144.  Fed policy makers will hold their benchmark  interest rate 
next week at zero to 0.25 percent, where it’s been since
December 2008, according to all 75 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. At their last meeting on March 13, they signaled
they would off on boosting stimulus unless the U.S. economic
expansion faltered or inflation fell below a 2 percent target.  Futures traders  raised bets the euro will decline against
the dollar. Net-shorts for the euro rose to 118,125 in the five
days ended April 17, the most since Feb. 21, from 101,364 a week
earlier, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed.  The dollar climbed 4.3 percent over the past year against
nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen rose 4.1 percent, the
biggest loser on the gauge, while the euro dropped 5.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
