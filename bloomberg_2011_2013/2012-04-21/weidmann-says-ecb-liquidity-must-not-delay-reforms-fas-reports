Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said “the generous supply” of liquidity from the  European
Central Bank  must not result in banks and governments postponing
necessary reforms,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung 
reported.  European banks need to “thoroughly adjust” balance sheets
and strengthen capital levels while governments have to quickly
implement structural reforms and credibly consolidate budgets,
the newspaper cited Weidmann as saying in a preview of a story
that will run tomorrow. If countries need bridging help during
that process, providing such aid is the task of European rescue
programs and not of central banks, Weidmann said.  Central banks’ monetary measures must “not replace, nor
delay, adjustments,” Weidmann told the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
