Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said the nation’s economy is almost back to its full capacity,
and reiterated that higher  interest rates  may become
appropriate.  Carney, speaking in an interview with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp.,  said the country’s underlying inflation
rate has firmed in the last several months and the central bank
expects the economy to grow at “above trend” rates in 2012 and
2013.  “It’s in that environment -- that given the fact that
rates are exceptionally low, there is considerable monetary
stimulus -- that we have signaled that if this continues, in
light of the situation, some modest withdrawal of that
considerable monetary stimulus may become appropriate,” Carney
said, adding that would  be a decision the central bank would
weigh carefully.  To contact the reporter on this story:
