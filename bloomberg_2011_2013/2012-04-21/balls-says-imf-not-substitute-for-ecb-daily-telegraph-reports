Ed Balls , finance spokesman for the
U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, said the International Monetary
Fund shouldn’t become a substitute for the European Central Bank
during the euro-region crisis, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne , a Conservative
who offered 10 billion pounds ($16.1 billion) to the IMF in
Washington, shouldn’t give it “a single extra penny,” Balls
told the paper. Austerity in Southern Europe isn’t working and
deficits can’t go down without growth, he told the newspaper.  While the ECB and the euro region doesn’t have “the
capacity” to deal with Italy’s and Spain’s issues “it would be
wrong to ask the global taxpayer to put up” the money, the
Telegraph cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
