Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere SpA
said the removal of the shipwrecked Costa Concordia from Giglio
island in  Italy  was awarded to Titan Salvage and Micoperi.  The operation, subject to final approval by Italian
authorities, will begin early next month and is expected to take
about a year, the company said today in a statement.  The wreck will be removed in one piece, re-floated and
towed to an Italian port, Costa Crociere said. Fuel removal was
completed on March 24 and throughout the operation environmental
protection will have “top priority,” the company said.  Pompano Beach, Florida-based Titan Salvage, is a unit of
Crowley Maritime Corporation and has performed more than 350
salvage and wreck removal projects since being founded in 1980,
according to its  website . The operation will be carried out in
partnership with Micoperi, an Italian  marine contractor .  The Costa Concordia ran aground near Giglio hours after
leaving a port close to  Rome  with 4,200 passengers and crew on
Jan. 13, leaving at least 25 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
