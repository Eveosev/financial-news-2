Eric Chavez  hit two of the Yankees’
five solo home runs as New York defeated the Red Sox 6-2 in a
game marking the 100th birthday of Boston’s Fenway Park.  Yesterday’s contest at the oldest stadium in  Major League
Baseball  came on the centennial of the first official game at
the park. That game 100 years ago was between the Red Sox and
the New York Highlanders, later renamed the Yankees.  Alex Rodriguez , Nick Swisher and Russell Martin also hit
home runs for the Yankees (8-6). Rodriguez recorded his 631st
homer to surpass Ken Griffey Jr. for fifth place on the career
list.  “It was a very cool ceremony,” Rodriguez said about the
pregame introductions of about 200 former  Red Sox  players,
managers and coaches. “They put on a great show, but the game
was good, too.”  Derek Jeter, who went 1-for-5, moved into 18th place for
career hits at 3,111. He passed Dave Winfield.  “You’re going to hit home runs every once in a while, but
we can’t sit around and wait for it,” Jeter said.  David Ortiz homered for Boston (4-9), which lost its fourth
straight game.  Frustrating to Lose  “We’re a good team,” Boston’s Adrian Gonzalez said.
“We’re just not playing good baseball. It’s frustrating the way
we’re losing.”  Ivan Nova (3-0) got the win, allowing two runs on seven
hits in six innings. Red Sox starter  Clay Buchholz  (1-1), who
allowed all five homers, took the loss.  At Citi Field in  New York , Hector Sanchez hit the go-ahead
single in the 10th inning for the San Francisco Giants in their
4-3 victory over the New York Mets.  The Giants had a 3-0 lead until New York’s Jason Bay and
Kirk Nieuwenhuis started a rally with home runs in the fourth
and fifth innings. Josh Thole’s one-run single in the ninth sent
the game into extra innings.  At  Chicago ’s Wrigley Field, the Cincinnati Reds defeated
the Chicago Cubs 9-4 for the 10,000th victory in franchise
history.  The Reds (6-8) joined the Cubs, San Francisco Giants, Los
Angeles Dodgers,  Atlanta Braves  and St. Louis Cardinals as
10,000-game winners.  ‘Pretty Cool’  “When you look at 30 different teams and being one of six,
it’s a pretty cool thing,” said outfielder Drew Stubbs who
drive in three runs for the Reds. “To be a part of it is pretty
special.”  The Cubs (3-11) dropped their sixth straight game.  In the American League, it was Minnesota 5, Tampa Bay 4;
Toronto 4, Kansas City 3; the Chicago White Sox 7, Seattle 3;
the Los Angeles Angels 6, Baltimore 3; and Cleveland 4, Oakland
3.  In the National League, it was Washington 2, Miami 0; St.
Louis 4, Pittsburgh 1; Colorado 4, Milwaukee 3; the Los Angeles
Dodgers 3, Houston 1; Atlanta 9, Arizona 1; and Philadelphia 4,
San Diego 1.  The Texas Rangers’ game against the Tigers was postponed by
rain in  Detroit  and will be played today as a day-night
doubleheader.  To contact the reporters on this story:
