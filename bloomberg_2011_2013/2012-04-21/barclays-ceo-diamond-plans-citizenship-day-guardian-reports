Barclays Plc (BARC) , Britain’s second-
biggest bank by assets, is planning a “citizenship day” next
month, the Guardian  reported .  The event will be held on May 23 and will involve
presentations by  Robert Diamond , the lender’s chief executive
officer, and Antony Jenkins, who heads the bank’s retail
operations, the Guardian said.  Diamond made “citizenship” one of his four priorities for
the bank when he became CEO in January 2011 and has previously
talked about the need to win back trust from the public and from
customers, the Guardian reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
