Iran  plans to produce 850,000
barrels a day from fields it shares with  Iraq  and Qatar by 2015,
the director of combined planning at National Iranian Oil Co.
said, according to the Oil Ministry website Shana.  While Iran is producing about the same amount of oil as
Iraq from their shared onshore fields, it lags behind Qatar in
producing from the oil layer of the shared offshore South Pars
natural-gas field, Abdol-Majid Delparish was cited as saying by
the website.  Neither Iran nor Iraq produces gas from their shared
onshore fields, Delparish said. Iran produces 230 million cubic
meters of gas a day from South Pars, while Qatar produces 430
million, he said.  Iranâ€™s recoverable reserves are 154 billion barrels of oil
and 33.5 trillion cubic meters of gas, according to the latest
assessments, Delparish said on the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
