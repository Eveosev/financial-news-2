Indonesia’s Bakrie family received
a default notice from creditors on a $437 million loan after a
drop in the shares of London-listed mining company  Bumi Plc (BUMI)  that
guarantee the facility, the Financial Times reported.  Lenders led by  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  probably won’t demand
repayment even if the family fails to increase collateral, the
FT reported, citing people familiar with the deal.  The Bakries and Bumi Chairman Samin Tan together own 47.6
percent of Bumi, and the family’s financial woes contributed to
the company’s 60 percent share fall over the past year, the
newspaper said.  The shares were also hurt by the ousting last year of
Bumi’s co-chairman, Nathaniel Rothschild, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
