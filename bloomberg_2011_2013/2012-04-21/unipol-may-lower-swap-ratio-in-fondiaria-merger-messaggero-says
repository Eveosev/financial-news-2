Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI)  may
lower the swap ratio in a planned merger with  Fondiaria-SAI SpA (FSA) 
to control 60 percent to 65 percent of the company once the deal
is completed, il Messaggero reported.  Unipol previously proposed holding 66.7 percent of the new
entity. As part of the new terms being discussed,  Premafin
Finanziaria SpA (PF) , Fondiariaâ€™s controlling shareholder, may
convert all of its debt into a convertible bond, Messaggero
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Separately,  Il Sole 24 Ore  said Fondiaria may hold a board
meeting as soon as tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
