Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  cut Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman  Aubrey McClendon ’s compensation
15 percent last year to $17.86 million in response to
shareholder concerns that he was paid too much.  McClendon told the company’s board of directors in
September he will participate again this year in a well-
ownership program that he reported lost him more than $600
million in the past three years, according to a public  filing 
today.  The 52-year-old co-founder of the second-largest U.S.
natural-gas producer is facing investor criticism for taking out
personal loans to help pay drilling costs associated with his
ownership stake in Chesapeake wells, using the stakes as
collateral. Chesapeake said on April 18 there is nothing
improper in the loans.  During the first quarter, McClendon reported $88.1 million
in net losses in the wells program after accounting for capital
expenses, according to the filing. Full-year losses amounted to
$315.3 million, $141.9 million and $116.1 million, respectively,
for 2011, 2010 and 2009.  McClendon bought stakes in company wells in all but five
quarters since Chesapeake became a publicly-traded entity in
1993, according to the filing.  The company doesn’t loan money to McClendon and is under no
obligation to repay any personal loans he obtains, according to
the filing.  The pay package included $13.6 million in stock awards, a
$1.95 million bonus and $975,000 in salary, the Oklahoma City-
based company said in the filing. Shareholders were concerned
that “Mr. McClendon’s total compensation has been too high for
the past few years,” according to the filing.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is the largest U.S. producer of natural
gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
