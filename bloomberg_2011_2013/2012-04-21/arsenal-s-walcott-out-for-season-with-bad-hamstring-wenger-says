Arsenal winger Theo Walcott is
likely to miss the rest of the Premier League season with a
hamstring injury, manager  Arsene Wenger  said.  Walcott left today’s 0-0 tie with Chelsea in the second
half after pulling up while running. Wenger said the injury
usually takes a minimum of 21 days to heal and that Walcott
should be available for  England  in the European Championship
this summer.  “He should be OK to play for England, he just will have a
good rest,” Wenger said on Arsenal’s website. “But I don’t
think he will be ready to play for us.”  Arsenal is third in the Premier League with three games
remaining in its season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
