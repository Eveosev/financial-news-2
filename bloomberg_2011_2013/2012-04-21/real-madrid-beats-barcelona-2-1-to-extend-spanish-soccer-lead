Real Madrid beat Barcelona 2-1 to
move a step closer to the championship in Spanish soccer’s La
Liga.  Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning goal in the 73rd
minute at the Camp Nou stadium as Real moved seven points ahead
of Barcelona with four games remaining. Real ended a seven-game
winless run in the matchup known as “El Clasico” and handed
Barcelona its first home loss in 55 games.  Real’s Sami Khedira opened the scoring in the 17th minute.
It was Real’s 108th league goal of the season, breaking the La
Liga record the club set in the 1989-90 campaign.  Barcelona’s  Alexis Sanchez  tied the game in the 72nd
minute, but Ronaldo scored the winner a minute later when he got
behind the defense and fired a shot by  Victor Valdes . It was his
42nd league goal of the season, moving him one ahead of
Barcelona’s  Lionel Messi  in the La Liga scoring race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
