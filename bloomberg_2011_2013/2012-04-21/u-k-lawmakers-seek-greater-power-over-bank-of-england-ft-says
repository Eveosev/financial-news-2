U.K. lawmakers are pressuring
Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to increase the Bank
of England’s accountability by imposing new supervisory controls
over its next governor, the Financial Times reported.  Members of Parliament’s Treasury Committee want the central
bank’s internal watchdog, called the court, to be able to review
senior staff and conduct retrospective reviews of its actions,
such as its handling of the financial crisis, the FT reported.
The proposed controls are seen as a response to the central
bank’s “sweeping” new authority over banking regulation, the
FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
