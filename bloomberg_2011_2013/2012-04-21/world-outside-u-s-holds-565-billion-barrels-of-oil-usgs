The world excluding the U.S. holds
565 billion barrels of undiscovered, conventional oil and 5,606
trillion cubic feet of natural-gas, according to the  U.S.
Geological Survey .  These numbers represent technically recoverable resources,
or quantities of oil and gas that can be produced using
currently available technology and industry practices,
regardless of accessibility or economic considerations, it said
in a statement posted April 18 on its website.  The data includes the average estimate of resources in 171
geological provinces of the world, onshore and offshore, the
USGS said in its first assessment since 2000. Almost three-
quarters of the oil is in four regions: 126 billion barrels in
 South America  and the Caribbean; 115 billion in sub-Saharan
Africa; 111 billion in the  Middle East  and North Africa; and 61
billion in Arctic areas of  North America , according to the
statement.  The report doesn’t include undiscovered, conventional
resources in the U.S., which the USGS estimates at 27 billion
barrels of oil and 388 trillion cubic feet of gas on and
offshore. There are an additional 81 billion barrels of oil and
398 trillion cubic feet of gas in the U.S. outer continental
shelf, the statement said, citing the  Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management .  Unconventional oil and gas resources, such as shale gas,
tight oil, tight gas, coal-bed gas, heavy oil and oil sands may
be significant around the world though they aren’t included in
the data, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
