German Finance Minister  Wolfgang
Schaeuble  said the cost of controlling the European debt crisis
will be of a manageable size for his country in the event of  “
reasonably normal development,”  Leipziger Volkszeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  He added that the costs would be offset by the economic
damage that could be avoided, LVZ reported.  Schaeuble also hoped that the worst of the European
sovereign-debt crisis was over, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
