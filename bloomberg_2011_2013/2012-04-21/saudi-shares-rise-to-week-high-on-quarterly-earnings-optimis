Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock
index advanced to the highest in almost two weeks as first-
quarter profit at companies including  Saudi Telecom Co. (STC)  beat
estimates and after oil rose for the first time in three days
yesterday.  The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  climbed 1.4 percent to 7,618.07
at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh, the highest since April 9.
 Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest petrochemicals
company, whose profit last week exceeded analysts’ forecasts,
increased 2 percent. Saudi Telecom, the kingdom’s largest phone-
service provider, rose to the highest in more than a year after
quarterly net income surged 60 percent.  “Sentiment is strong as first-quarter earnings at most
Saudi companies are out, and positive,” said Turki Fadaak, head
of research at Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co. “Sabic’s
earnings last week and the raising of the global economic
forecast also boosted sentiment.”  Sabic, the company with the  heaviest weighting  on  Saudi
Arabia ’s index, said April 17 net income for the quarter was
7.27 billion riyals ($1.94 billion), beating the 6.64 billion-
riyal  average estimate  of seven analysts. The stock rose to 104
riyals today, the highest since April 9.  Saudi Telecom shares climbed 3.2 percent to 42.50 riyals,
the highest since January 2011, after net income surged to 2.5
billion riyals, beating the 1.92 billion-riyal average forecast
of seven analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  European stocks capped the first weekly gain since mid-
March as the  International Monetary Fund  raised its forecasts
for global economic growth, U.S. corporate earnings beat
estimates and German business confidence improved. The  STOXX
Europe 600 (SXXP)  climbed 1.7 percent in the five days through
yesterday.  Crude for May delivery yesterday rose 0.8 percent to
$103.05 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Saudi
Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter, depended on oil for
93 percent of its revenue in 2011.  Saudi Arabia’s stock market is the only Gulf Arab bourse
that has trading on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
