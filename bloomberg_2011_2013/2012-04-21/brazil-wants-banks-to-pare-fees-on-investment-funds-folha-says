President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration wants Brazilian banks to lower fees charged on
investment funds, Folha de S.Paulo reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  Such a move would allow borrowing costs in Brazil to fall
further without affecting the country’s savings-account rules,
Folha said. Policy makers this week lowered the benchmark
 lending rate  to 9 percent from 9.75 percent.  Since Brazilian law requires minimum returns on savings
accounts, the government’s concern is that further cuts in
borrowing costs can drive investors out of investment funds that
track the Selic rate and into bank deposits. Lower fees in those
funds would postpone the need for the government to change
savings-account rules, according to Folha.  To contact the reporter on this story:
