Ireland’s  National Asset Management
Agency  defended in court giving less than an hour’s notice to a
hotel-company shareholder affected by the sale of a 660 million-
pound ($1.06 billion) loan, the Financial Times reported.  Patrick McKillen, a shareholder in hotel owner Coroin Ltd.,
is suing David and  Frederick Barclay , the newspaper said. NAMA,
which had taken control of the loan from Anglo Irish Bank Corp.
and the  Bank of Ireland , argued the length of the notice didn’t
matter because there was nothing that could have stopped the
transfer of the loan to the Barclays, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
