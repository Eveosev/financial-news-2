Japan pledged 600 billion yen ($7.4
billion) in development aid to support infrastructure projects
in five Southeast Asian nations that share the Mekong River.  Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda , who met with the leaders of
 Thailand , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar today in  Tokyo ,
expressed appreciation for their self-help efforts, particularly
Thailand’s contributions to the development of the Mekong region
through bilateral and regional frameworks, according to an
official statement issued after the summit.  Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, Vietnamese Prime
Minister Nguyen Tan Dung, Laotian Prime Minister Thongsing Thammavong and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen committed their
nations to use the Japanese aid efficiently and effectively to
develop infrastructure that will contribute to economic activity
and help ensure basic human needs, according to the statement.  Today’s gathering followed a November 2009 meeting in which
then-Prime Minister  Yukio Hatoyama  pledged at least 500 billion
yen to spur development and address climate change issues in the
region. Noda meets later to discuss debt relief with Myanmar
President  Thein Sein  as he moves the country formerly known as
Burma toward democracy.  Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in December agreed to
ask the Japanese government to help assess the impact of planned
hydropower dams along the Mekong. Laos agreed to suspend
construction of a $3.7 billion dam on concern the project would
hurt fisheries and rice cultivation downstream.  About 60 million people depend on the river and its
tributaries for food, water and transportation.  The leaders also agreed to cooperate on disaster
management, and continue efforts on environmental and climate
change issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
