Icelandic landowners prevented
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  from visiting volcanic crater lake
Kerid in his two-day state visit to the island, as they oppose
the policies of both  China ’s and Iceland’s governments, the
Visir news service reported today.  Wen was meant to visit the privately owned Kerid volcanic
crater lake on his visit to the southern part of the north
Atlantic island today.  Due to the policies of the two governments, “Icelandic
authorities were notified that this visit wasn’t welcome to
Kerid,” Oskar Magnusson, one of the landowners, told the
Reykjavik-based  news service .  To contact the reporter on this story:
