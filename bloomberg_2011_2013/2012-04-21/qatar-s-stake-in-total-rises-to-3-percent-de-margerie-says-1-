Qatar’s stake in  Total SA (FP)  has risen
to 3 percent, according to the chairman and chief executive
officer of Europe’s third-largest oil company.  “It’s a good company, it’s a good investment,” Christophe de Margerie said in an interview in Doha.  The Persian Gulf emirate, the world’s biggest exporter of
liquefied natural gas, has been buying shares in French
companies including Lagarde SCA and  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton SA (MC)  amid rising gas revenues. The Qatar Investment
Authority, the country’s sovereign wealth fund, holds more than
$65 billion of investments, Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Abdullah
al-Mahmood said at a conference in Doha.  Total and Qatar are planning to invest in joint projects in
West Africa, de Margerie said. The French energy producer owns
stakes in gas liquefaction plants, a condensate refinery and
petrochemical plants in the state.  A spokesman for the Qatar Investment Authority and state-
run oil company Qatar Petroleum didn’t immediately respond to e-
mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
