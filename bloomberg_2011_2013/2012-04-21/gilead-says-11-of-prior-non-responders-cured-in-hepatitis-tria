Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s experimental
hepatitis C drug cleared the virus in 11 percent of patients who
hadn’t responded to prior treatment, the company said today.  A combination of Gilead’s 7977 drug and the antiviral
ribavirin cleared 1 out of 9 so-called “null responder”
patients with the most common genotype 1 form of the virus four
weeks after ending treatment, the  Foster City , California-based
company said today in a poster at the European Association for
the Study of Liver meeting in Barcelona. The cure rate compares
with 88 percent of patients who had never been treated before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
