Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo
said the country must wait until after  France ’s presidential
elections to renegotiate its share of guarantees given as part
of stricken lender  Dexia SA (DEXB) ’s rescue,  De Tijd  reported.  “At this moment it is not realistic to negotiate with the
French,” he said in an interview with  De Tijd . “We will have
to wait until after the second round of French elections to re-
contact.”  Dexia, based in Brussels and Paris, is being broken up
after last year losing access to short-term funding. Belgian
Finance Minister Steven Vanackere favors a deal on the
guarantees with France to reduce his country’s exposure to Dexia
risks, De Tijd said.  Di Rupo also stressed the importance of a decision on who
should run Dexia. Top executives should be people “in which the
government has the fullest confidence,” he told the newspaper,
citing the amount of tax money at stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
