Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11) , the Brazilian
bank led by billionaire  Andre Esteves , attracted more than $6.6
billion in orders for its initial public offering, three times
its goal, a person familiar with the deal said.  The price of the units sold will probably be at the top of
the proposed range, or 33.75 reais apiece, said the person, who
asked to remain anonymous because the transaction is still being
marketed. That would value the bank at 29.4 billion reais or
about 3.5 times its book value.  The bank told investors that it plans to close orders on
April 23, earlier than a prior deadline of noon April 24, so it
can have more time to do a better allocation, the person said.  BTG said it needs orders of 4.1 billion reais ($2.2
billion). It had said in a regulatory filing that it may sell as
many as 121.5 million units that represent voting and non-voting
shares priced at 28.75 reais to 33.75 reais each. BTG is selling
as much as 14 percent of its capital including the
overallotment. Actual shareholders can sell up to 2.8 percent of
their holdings.  The units are scheduled to be priced April 24 and start
trading in  Sao Paulo  and Amsterdam two days later. The bank
plans to use proceeds to “continue expanding its businesses”
and to improve its “funding structure,” according to the
prospectus.  A BTG official declined to comment, citing a “silent
period” before the IPO.  Banco Bradesco SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Citigroup Inc., Banco do Brasil SA, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank
AG and Morgan Stanley are managing the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
