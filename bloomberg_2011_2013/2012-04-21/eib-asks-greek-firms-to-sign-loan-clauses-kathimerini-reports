The  European Investment Bank , the
European Union’s bank, is asking Greek companies to sign loan
agreements that include clauses to renegotiate debts in
case the country reverts to the drachma, Kathimerini reported.  Public Power Corp. (PPC)  SA was asked to agree to two new clauses 
in talks on a 70 million-euro ($93 million) loan two weeks ago,
the Athens-based newspaper said, without saying how it got the
information. One clause was for a renegotiation of loan terms in
the event of a currency change, either if Greece left the euro
or the euro area broke up, while the other ensured  English law 
would prevail in the event of non-payment, the paper said.  The bank will include the currency clause in new loans with
 Greece , Ireland and Portugal, all countries under bailout plans,
Kathimerini said. The EIB plans to extend the clause gradually
to all euro area countries, according to the paper. Calls to EIB
spokesman Rainer Schlitt in Luxembourg today after regular
business hours weren’t answered and an e-mail wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
