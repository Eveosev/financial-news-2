Phoenix Coyotes  forward Raffi Torres was suspended 25 games by the  National Hockey League  for
a body check that left Marian Hossa of the Chicago Blackhawks on
a stretcher.  Torres left his feet while inflicting a “late hit” to
Hossa’s head in Game 3 of their first-round Stanley Cup playoff
series on April 17, the NHL said in a statement. Torres wasn’t
assessed a penalty on the play at the time.  Hossa, 33, lay on the ice for more than 3 minutes before
being taken to a hospital. The five-time All-Star was released
and didn’t play in Game 4 two nights ago.  Torres has already served one game of his suspension in
Game 4. The ban will carry over until next season if not
completed by the end of the playoffs, and Torres won’t be
allowed to play in any preseason games until the suspension is
served, the  league said .  Torres, 30, had a goal and an assist in the first three
games of the best-of-seven series, while Hossa was held
scoreless. Phoenix leads the series 3-1 and can advance to the
next round with a home win tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
