Volvo Car Corp. (175) , the Swedish
carmaker owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., said
it plans to more than double its number of models to compete
with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi and BMW AG in the world’s largest
automobile market.  Volvo, which currently sells 6 models in China, is planning
to introduce 10 new ones in the country within six years,
including “bigger and more luxury high end” vehicles, as well
as medium- to small-sized cars such as the V40 hatchback, Volvo
said in an e-mail.  The new models are part of Geely’s plans to double sales to
800,000 cars globally in 10 years. Volvo, ranked fifth in
luxury-car sales in China, intends to invest as much as $11
billion globally by 2016 to meet its expansion plans, Volvo
Chief Executive Officer  Stefan Jacoby  said last year.  “We are going to make huge investments into development
and facility construction in China,” Zhejiang Geely Chairman  Li Shufu  said in an interview in Beijing today. “I believe Volvo
will meet its growth target in the world as well as in China.”  Gothenburg, Sweden-based Volvo, which Zhejiang Geely bought
from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2010 for $1.5 billion, plans to sell
200,000 cars in China by 2015, compared with 47,150 in 2011, the
company estimated last year. Volvo is also seeking government
approval to build plants in the city of  Chengdu , southwestern
China, and a second factory in northeastern city of Daqing.  Volvo has been targeting to start local production in China
in 2013. Still, the plan is subject to government approval,
which is beyond the company’s control, Li said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
