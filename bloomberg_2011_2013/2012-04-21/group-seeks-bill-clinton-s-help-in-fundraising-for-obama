Priorities USA Action, a Democratic
group working to re-elect President  Barack Obama , has asked
former President  Bill Clinton  to help raise money, according to
a person familiar with the matter.  The so-called super political action committee, founded by
former White House aides Bill Burton and  Sean Sweeney  to counter
Republican fundraising organizations, took in $2.5 million last
month, according to financial disclosure documents filed
yesterday.  That figure is about $6 million less than the $8.7 million
raised in March by Restore Our Future, a super-PAC backing
presumptive Republican presidential nominee  Mitt Romney ,
according to Federal Election Commission filings. American
Crossroads, a super-PAC co-founded by Karl Rove, the former top
political strategist to former President  George W. Bush , raised
$1.2 million last month.  Super-PACs can take in unlimited corporate, union and
individual donations. The super-PACs are barred from making
donations to candidates, and can spend money independently of
the campaigns.  Clinton has conveyed to the pro-Obama group that he is
inclined to help them catch up with Republican groups, said the
person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t
authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Last week, Sweeney met with Doug Band, a Clinton associate,
to explore ways to involve the former president in tapping his
donor network, the person said.  The news of Priorities USA’s outreach to Clinton was
reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
