Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has
given striker  Robin van Persie  a 72-hour window after the season
ends to resolve his future with the club, the  Daily Mirror  said.  Van Persie’s contract runs out after next season. Wenger
wants to work out a new deal with the Premier League’s top
scorer in between the season ending May 13 and Van Persie’s
joining the Netherlands national team four days later for pre-
European Championship training.  “It will be sorted at the end of the season, before the
Euros,” the Mirror quoted Wenger as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
