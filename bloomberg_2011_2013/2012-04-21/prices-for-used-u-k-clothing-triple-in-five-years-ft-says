Prices paid for used U.K. clothing
have tripled to 650 pounds ($1,048) a metric ton from 220 pounds
in 2007, driven by increased demand for second-hand British
brands in  Africa  and eastern  Europe , the Financial Times
reported.  The shift is hurting charities as people forgo donating and
sell the items to chain stores such as Cash4Clothes, which pays
5 pounds for full trash bags of cast-off attire, the FT
reported.  The items end up in stores such as Virgo in Warsaw, which
specializes in U.K. clothing, the FT said. Poland imported 51
million euros ($67.4 million) worth of used clothing last year,
with more than half coming from the U.K., according to the
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
