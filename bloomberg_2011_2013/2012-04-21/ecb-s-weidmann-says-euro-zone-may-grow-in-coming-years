Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
said all 17 euro members are likely to keep the joint currency
in coming years and that other countries may also sign up, Welt
am Sonntag reported, citing an interview.  An exit by  Greece  wouldn’t solve its problems and may lead
to pressure on other members to quit the currency, Weidmann
said, according to a preview of a story to run in  Welt am
Sonntag  tomorrow. Solidarity in the European Union “has
limits,” which is why the international aid to Greece is tied
to certain conditions, the newspaper cited Weidmann as saying.  While the European Union’s rescue funds and loans “buy
time,” they don’t solve the problems behind the region’s debt
crisis, Weidmann is quoted as saying. The  European Central
Bank ’s measures to help solve the crisis means it sometimes
moves in “new, and very uncertain, territory,” Weidmann said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
