President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election committee had 10 times more money to spend than former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney’s campaign entering April,
Federal Election Commission reports show.  Obama reported a bank balance of $104.1 million after
raising $35.1 million in March. That included $7.5 million
transferred from a joint fundraising account with the  Democratic
National Committee . Romney finished March with $10.1 million
after raising $13.1 million during the month, his best in the
campaign.  Through March 31, Obama raised $196.6 million for his re-
election, more than twice as much as the $88.7 million collected
by Romney’s campaign. Those sums don’t include money contributed
to political action committees supporting the candidates.  Obama continued to rely heavily on small-dollar donors, as
he did in 2008. Last month, 52 percent of the money going
directly to his campaign committee came in amounts of $200 or
less. Romney collected 13 percent of his money in those amounts.  The president also reported an increase in his top
bundlers, supporters who tap their own networks to raise money.
He identified 117 people who brought in at least $500,000,
compared with 61 at the end of 2011.  Those newly identified as raising more than $500,000 for
the campaign include Laura Ricketts, co-owner of the  Chicago
Cubs  and the first openly gay owner of a major league sports
team; Stewart Bainum, chairman of  Silver Spring , Maryland-based
 Choice Hotels International Inc. (CHH) ; and Michael Sacks, chief
executive officer of Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management.  Naming Bundlers  Obama is the only candidate identifying all of his
fundraisers. Romney disclosed just two, lobbyists Paul Mattera
of Liberty Mutual Group Inc. and Joseph Wall of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. By law, candidates must identify lobbyists raising
money for them.  Romney became the presumptive Republican nominee with the
April 10 departure from the race of his chief rival for the
nomination, former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum . Former
U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  and U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of  Texas  remain as Republican candidates.  A political action committee backing Romney, Restore Our
Future, took in $8.7 million last month and had $6.5 million
left to spend. Harold Simmons, chairman of Dallas-based Contran
Corp., gave $600,000; he gave $200,000 earlier this year.  The pro-Obama PAC Priorities USA Action trailed in
fundraising, bringing in $2.5 million even after the president
in February began urging supporters to contribute. Top donors
included writer Amy P. Goldman, who gave $1 million; comedian
Chelsea Handler, who donated $100,000; and longtime Democratic
giver Bernard L. Schwartz, chief executive officer of BLS
Investments, who also donated $100,000. The PAC ended the month
with $5 million in the bank.  Candidates in Debt  Santorum raised $5 million last month, bringing his total
to $20.7 million. He had $1.8 million in the bank and reported
debts of $2 million, including $760,009 for media to  John Brabender , his senior adviser, and $483,237 for online services
and ads.  He was aided by a super-PAC, the Red White and Blue Fund,
which raised $2.6 million and finished the month with $263,000
cash on hand. Louisiana energy executive William Dore, an
earlier $1.5-million donor, gave $750,000 more. Wyoming investor
Foster Freiss contributed $500,000, bringing his total donations
to $2.1 million.  Gingrich took in $1.7 million, and finished the month with
$1.2 million in the bank. He has now raised $22.6 million for
his campaign. He had $4.3 million in debts, almost triple what
he reported owing a month earlier. His debts included $271,776
to himself for travel expenses and $1.1 million to the air-
charter company Moby Dick Airways.  Winning Our Future, a super-PAC backing Gingrich, raised
$5.1 million in March, $5 million of it from Miriam Adelson,
wife of billionaire casino executive  Sheldon Adelson . The couple
has given $20 million to the PAC, which ended March with $5.8
million in the bank.  Paul raised $2.6 million last month and has now taken in
$37 million for his campaign. He had $1.8 million in the bank at
the end of March. He received 37 percent of his donations last
month in amounts of $200 or less.  To contact the reporters on this story:
