Kyrie Irving had 21 points for the
 Cleveland Cavaliers , who defeated the playoff-bound New York
Knicks 98-90 as the National Basketball Association’s regular
season nears its end.  The Knicks (33-30), seventh in the Eastern Conference
standings, have clinched a playoff spot while the Cavaliers (21-
41) are in 13th place outside the eight-team playoff list.  Manny Harris had 19 points and 12 rebounds and Samardo Samuels added 15 points for the Cavaliers, who had a 45-34
halftime lead at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.  Amar’e Stoudemire, who had been out since March 26 with a
bulging disk in his back, and Steve Novak each scored 15 points
for the Knicks, while Carmelo Anthony and Mike Bibby added 12
apiece.  The regular season ends April 26 with the playoffs
beginning two days later.  Before the game, the Knicks signed free-agent center Dan Gadzuric and waived guard/forward  Bill Walker , the team said in
a news release. Terms of Gadzuric’s deal were not released by
the team.  The 6-foot-11 Gadzuric has averaged 4.7 points and 4.4
rebounds per game in nine NBA seasons with the  Milwaukee Bucks ,
 Golden State Warriors  and  New Jersey Nets .  Walker, who is 6-foot-6, averaged 5.9 points in 32 games --
including eight starts -- for the Knicks this season. He moved
to New York from Boston in a trade in February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
