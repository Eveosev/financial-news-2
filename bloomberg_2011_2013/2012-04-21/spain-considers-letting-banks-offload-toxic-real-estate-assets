Spain  is considering allowing banks
to offload real-estate assets for which they have already set
aside provisions as part of measures to clean up the finance
industry.  The Economy Ministry is still considering ways to let banks
take the provisioned assets off their books and rules out
forming a so-called bad bank funded by the taxpayer, a ministry
official said, declining to be named in line with government
policy.  Spain is trying to restore investor confidence in its
banking system amid concern the nation’s real-estate collapse
will overburden public finances. The European Union said April
19 that Spain doesn’t need to seek help in recapitalizing its
banks and that it doesn’t plan to tap rescue funds.  In a  presentation  to analysts in  London , Jose Maria Roldan,
head of banking regulation at the Bank of Spain, raised the
possibility of lenders separating bad assets into different
vehicles once losses have been recognized and written down.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in February that
banks would have until the end of May to present merger plans
that would give them two years instead of one to make additional
provisions for real estate on their balance sheets.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , in power since December,
pledged a “true restructuring” of the industry at no cost to
the taxpayer four years after the decade-long property boom
collapsed.  In November, Rajoy asked for at least two papers from
academics on how to create a bad bank, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter, who declined be named because the
process isn’t public.  To contact the reporters on this story:
