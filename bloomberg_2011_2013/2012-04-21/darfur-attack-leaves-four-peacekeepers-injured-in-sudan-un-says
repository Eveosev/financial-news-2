Four United Nations peacekeepers
were injured when they came under attack while on patrol in
 Sudan ’s West Darfur province yesterday, the UN said.  A team of 32 soldiers were ambushed by unidentified gunmen
close to their base camp in Mourne, about 70 kilometers (43
miles) southeast of El Geneina, the state capital of West
Darfur,  Unamid , as the UN peacekeeping force is known, said in
an e-mailed statement today. Gunmen attacked peacekeepers again
after the force called in more soldiers, it said.  The wounded were taken by helicopter to hospital in El
Geneina and are in a stable condition, the UN said.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing
President Umar al-Bashir’s government of neglecting the region.
Unamid was deployed on Dec. 31, 2007, according to the UN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
