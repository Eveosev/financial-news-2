The pound had its biggest weekly
advance against the dollar in more than 15 months as investors
bet the  Bank of England  will pause its stimulus plan amid rising
inflation expectations.  The yield on  10-year gilts  rose for the first time in five
weeks after minutes of the central bank’s April 4-5 meeting
showed officials said inflation may accelerate at a faster pace
than previously forecast. Sterling appreciated to the strongest
level in more than 19-months against the euro as separate
reports showed U.K. home price and retail sale rose. U.S. data
showed more Americans than forecast filed claims for jobless
benefits and sales of previously owned homes dropped.  “The mood in the pound remains upbeat, with good reason,”
said  Daragh Maher , a currency strategist at HSBC Holdings Plc in
London. “Given the market’s appetite to buy the pound on any
dips, the uptrend still looks to have legs.”  The pound rose for the first week in three against the
dollar, climbing 1.8 percent to trade at $1.6124 a 4:54 p.m.
 London  time yesterday. That’s the biggest move since the five
days ended Jan. 14, 2011. It touched $1.6143, the most since
Oct. 31. Sterling strengthened 0.7 percent to 81.93 pence per
euro. It appreciated to 81.62 pence on April 19, the strongest
level since Aug. 26, 2010.  Retail Sales  Asking prices for U.K. homes rose to a record in April,
according to a Rightmove Plc report published April 16. Separate
data released yesterday showed  retail sales  rose at the fastest
pace for more than a year in March.  Short-sterling futures fell in the week, indicating
investors are adding to bets that  interest rates  will increase,
after the Bank of England minutes also showed policy maker  Adam Posen  dropped his push for extra stimulus this month. They were
published a day after data showed U.K. inflation unexpectedly
accelerated in March for the first time in six months.  Posen also told reporters that the U.K. economy will be
“stronger” than official data will show in the first half of
the year.  Gross domestic product  expanded 0.1 percent after a
0.3 percent contraction in the fourth quarter, according to the
median of 40 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The Debt Management Office plans to sell as much as three
billion pounds of bills on April 27. The agency will sell 3.75
percent 2052 gilts through banks.  The 10-year gilt yields rose 13 basis points in the week,
or 0.13 percentage point, to 2.17 percent. It reached 2.21
percent yesterday, the most since April 5. The 4 percent
security due March 2022 traded at 116.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
