Italy’s financial police seized
U.S. government securities with a nominal value of $1.5 billion
from an unidentified man in his 70s, they said in an e-mailed
statement.  The police said they also took certificates of deposit for
about 1,000 tons of gold, which together with the U.S. bonds are
worth more than 3 billion euros ($4 billion). The assets were
found in a briefcase in the man’s car in Viterbo near  Rome 
because of their “doubtful origin,” according to the
statement.  The man has previous convictions for robbery, extortion,
drug trafficking and  money laundering , according to the police
statement.  The probe, dubbed “Million Dollar,” is being carried out
in and around the capital in cooperation with officials from the
U.S. Embassy. Police said they’re evaluating “the authenticity,
the nature and the origin” of the securities, some of which may
date from the 1930s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
