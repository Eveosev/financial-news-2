China supports boosting funding for
the  International Monetary Fund  while stressing that the
Washington-based lender must continue implementing reforms as a
condition for specific cash commitments.  “We are supportive of international efforts to increase
the lending capacity of the IMF,” central bank Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in a statement in  Washington , where he was
attending the spring meetings of the institution. China “would
like to emphasize that increase of quota resources is an
integral part of increase of the Fund resources,” Zhou added.  Governments have committed more than $430 billion in fresh
money to the IMF to help it protect the world economy against
deepening debt turmoil in  Europe . While countries from the U.K.
to  Australia  pledged money, emerging markets including  China  and
Brazil held back details of their commitments as they tied them
to securing a bigger say within the fund. A 2010 plan to reduce
the voting power of rich nations, or so-called quotas, has yet
to be ratified.  Zhou welcomes Europe’s efforts to strengthen its firewall
against the region’s debt crisis, saying it’s a “positive
step” in stabilizing financial markets.  On the domestic economy, Zhou said China’s growth outlook
“remains positive” after the world’s second-biggest economy
expanded 8.1 percent in the first quarter.  While “near-term” inflation pressure have “moderated,”
policy makers remain “vigilant” amid “ample global
liquidity,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
