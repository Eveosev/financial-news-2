Ajai Chopra, the International
Monetary Fund’s mission head to Ireland, said that “risks” for
the country remain “high” as  household debt  and economic
uncertainty continue to weigh on demand, the Irish Times
reported.  If domestic demand doesn’t improve, and constrained export
growth keeps Irish growth “stuck at about 0.5 percent,”
Ireland’s debt will continue to rise, Chopra was reported as
saying.  The IMF has been pushing for “additional European
support” for Ireland beyond existing arrangements, Chopra said,
according to the report. He spoke to the newspaper at the IMF
meeting in  Washington  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
