German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said her country must prepare itself for a future with a higher
proportion of older people and investigate how that will change
cities and what it means for education and infrastructure.  “We’re happy that people are getting older, but we also
have less young people,” Merkel said in an e-mailed statement
today. The measures needed to deal with the demographic change
will be published in a report next week, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
