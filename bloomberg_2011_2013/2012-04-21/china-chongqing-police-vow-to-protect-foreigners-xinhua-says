The Chongqing police pledged to
protect foreigners in the Chinese municipality following the
death of a British national that’s linked to the ouster of
Chongqing Communist Party Secretary  Bo Xilai , the official
Xinhua News Agency reported today.  The death of Neil Heywood was a very “rare” case and few
foreigners have been victims of crimes in Chongqing, according
to the report, citing an unidentified official at the municipal
public security bureau.                   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
