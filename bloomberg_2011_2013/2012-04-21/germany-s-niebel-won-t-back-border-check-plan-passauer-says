Germany ’s Economic Cooperation
Minister Dirk Niebel declines to support a French and German
proposal to control national borders,  Passauer Neue Presse 
reported, citing an interview.  The free movement of people and goods is an “achievement”
of the European Union, the newspaper reported Niebel as saying.  France and Germany want to reintroduce border controls to
stem the flow of illegal immigrants entering the European
Union’s southern and eastern fringes,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
