Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said Guenter Grass’s claim that Israel is endangering
world peace by threatening to attack  Iran  over its atomic
program is an “absolute outrage,”  Welt am Sonntag  reported.  Israel “doesn’t seek to destroy Iran, Iran seeks to
destroy Israel and openly calls for it and works for it by
building atomic bombs for that expressed purpose,” the German
newspaper cited Netanyahu as saying in a preview of an article
that will be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
