Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA)  will invest
$740 million over four years in Neuquen province, the state-run
news service Telam said, citing comments by Governor Jorge Sapag
to reporters today.  The fields Petrobras plans to invest in donâ€™t include the
Veta Escondida concession, which was revoked by the provincial
government earlier this year, Telam said.  Sapag said the government-run company Gas y Petroleo del
Neuquen is willing to work with foreign partners, including
Petrobras and Tecpetrol SA, to develop other fields and the more
than 1,000 wells that are idled or abandoned in the province,
Telam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
