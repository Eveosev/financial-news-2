Germany’s IW institute will raise
its national growth forecast as an “astoundingly robust”
economy seems to be “disconnected” from the rest of  Europe ,
Director  Michael Huether  was cited as saying by  Euro am Sonntag .  The Cologne, Germany-based institute plans to publish its
2012 growth forecast on April 23, the German newspaper reported
in a preview of an article that will be published tomorrow.
Huether didn’t provide the raised forecast, saying only that the
3 percent growth seen in 2011 isn’t likely to be reached,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
