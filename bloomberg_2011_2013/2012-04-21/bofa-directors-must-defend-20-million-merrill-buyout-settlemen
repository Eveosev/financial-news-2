Bank of America Corp.  directors,
who were sued by shareholders for allegedly paying too much for
Merrill Lynch & Co., must defend a proposed $20 million
settlement of the claims in federal court in New York.  U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel, in a so-called order
to show cause filed April 13, said the directors and lead
plaintiffs Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System and Hollywood Police Officers’ Retirement must appear
before him to explain why they shouldn’t be stopped from
consummating the proposed settlement.  The judge issued the order in response to a request from
plaintiffs in a similar lawsuit in Delaware, according to the
filing in federal court in Manhattan. The supporting documents
filed by the  Delaware  plaintiffs weren’t available on the
website of the federal court in Manhattan.  The New York Times reported earlier that the Delaware
plaintiffs objected to the settlement in New York as inadequate.  Shirley Norton , a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, didn’t immediately return phone
and e-mail messages after regular business hours yesterday
seeking comment on the judge’s order.  The New York case is In re Bank of America securities,
derivative and employee retirement income securities act
litigation, 09-02058, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan.) The Delaware case is Nancy Rothbaum v.
 Kenneth D. Lewis , CA4307, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
