Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  is in good health after undergoing surgery in Istanbul,
Haberturk reported, without saying how it got the information.  The surgery yesterday at the Medipol Hospital was a follow-
up procedure to a Nov. 26 stomach operation to remove polyps,
the newspaper reported on its website. An official at the prime
minister’s press office in Ankara declined to confirm the report
when contacted by telephone.  Erdogan said in an interview on Jan. 19 with broadcaster
Kanal D that he doesn’t have cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
