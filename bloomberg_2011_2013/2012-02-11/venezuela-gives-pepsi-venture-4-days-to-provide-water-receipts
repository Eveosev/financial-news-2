Pepsi-Cola Venezuela CA 
has four days to provide receipts to the government after the
country’s price control agency received complaints that the
company raised its price for  mineral water  ahead of price caps.  The company, a joint venture between  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  and the
country’s largest foodmaker, Empresas Polar, must provide
receipts for the November-to-January period showing what it has
been charging for the water, according to a government statement
sent by e-mail today.  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  froze the prices of 19
consumer and cleaning products late last year as he widened
price controls to slow inflation that he says is fueled by
capitalist speculation. Chavez ordered Procter & Gamble Co. and
Coca-Cola Femsa SAB this week to cut prices on deodorant and 5-
liter bottles of water by 24 percent and 46 percent,
respectively, saying he would seize the companies if they don’t
comply.  Pepsi-Cola produces and distributes carbonated beverages,
bottled water, Gatorade and juices in  Venezuela .  Government agents had “explained clearly the goals of
their visit,” said Diana Sardi, Pepsi-Cola’s legal
representative for the joint venture in Venezuela, according to
the government statement.  Telephone calls placed outside of normal business hours to
Pepsi’s offices in Venezuela and the U.S. went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
