Jeffrey Zaslow, a reporter for the
Wall Street Journal and author of the“The Last Lecture,” died
of injuries suffered in a car accident yesterday, the newspaper
reported. He was 53.  Zaslow lost control of his car while driving on a snowy
road in northern  Michigan  and collided with a truck, the Journal
said, citing his wife, Sherry Margolis, and the Antrim County
Sheriff’s office.  His career included work as an advice columnist at the
 Chicago Sun-Times , succeeding Ann Landers, after winning a
competition for the position, the Journal said.  Zaslow wrote about a column about Carnegie Mellon
University professor Randy Pausch, who gave an inspiring  lecture 
in 2007 after being told he only had months to live following a
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the Journal said. He followed
that with a best-selling book called “The Last Lecture.”
Zaslow also collaborated on “Gabby: A Story of Courage and
Hope,” the story of U.S. Representative  Gabrielle Giffords , who
survived a shooting last year.  Zaslow is survived by his wife, who is a Fox television
affiliate anchor, three daughters and his parents, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
