Speculation that Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  asked President Dilma Rousseff to leave his post
is “unfounded,” the ministry said today.  Correio Braziliense said today on its website that Mantega
told Rousseff on Feb. 6 that he was too tired and wanted to
leave. The Brasilia-based newspaper didn’t say how it obtained
the information. Mantega, who has headed the  Finance Ministry 
since 2006, joined the government in 2003, after President  Luiz
Inacio Lula da Silva  was elected.  “It’s irresponsible for a journalist to publish rumors of
this kind,” the ministry said today in an e-mailed statement,
without mentioning Correio’s story. “The information is totally
unfounded.”  Since June, Rousseff has lost her Cabinet chief and the
ministers of transportation, labor, agriculture, tourism, sports
and cities over allegations of corruption. All have denied
wrongdoing. The defense minister stepped down in August after
criticizing other members of the government. The Education
Minister and the Women’s Rights Minister also stepped aside
earlier this year to run in local elections this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
