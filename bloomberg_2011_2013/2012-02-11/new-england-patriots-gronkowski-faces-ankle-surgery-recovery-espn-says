New England Patriots tight end  Rob Gronkowski  faces a 10-week recovery following arthroscopic
surgery on his left ankle, ESPN reported, citing a person
familiar with yesterday’s procedure.  Gronkowski, 22, sustained a high ankle sprain in the
American Football Conference championship game that limited his
performance to two catches for 26 yards in the Patriots’  Super
Bowl  loss to the  New York Giants .  During the 2011 National Football League regular season, he
had 90 receptions for 1,327 yards and an average of 82.9 yards
per game.  “The thing I do know is the guy absolutely is 100 percent
a passionate, passionate competitor when it comes to football,”
Patriots President Jonathan Kraft told ESPN Boston Radio. “He
loves football. He wants to win. He wants to get better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
