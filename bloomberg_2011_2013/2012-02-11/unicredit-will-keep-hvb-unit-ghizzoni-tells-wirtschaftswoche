UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  said speculation the Italian bank will
sell its HVB Group unit is incorrect, WirtschaftsWoche reported,
citing an interview with the CEO.  The German unit has become more important to Milan-based
UniCredit because of its “low” refinancing costs, “good”
capital levels and Germany’s economic growth, the German news
magazine cited Ghizzoni as saying. The Italian bank has scrapped
plans to rebrand HVB’s retail business as UniCredit,
WirtschaftsWoche said, citing the CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
