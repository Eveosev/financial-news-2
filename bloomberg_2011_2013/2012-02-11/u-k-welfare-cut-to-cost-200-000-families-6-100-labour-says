More than 200,000 working families
in Britain may lose as much as 3,870 pounds ($6,100) a year
because of Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s plans to cut tax
credits, the opposition  Labour Party  said.  Couples earning less than 17,700 pounds who have children
will lose all of their working tax credits from April unless
they boost the minimum number of hours they work to 24 from 16,
Labour said today, citing figures contained in a government
reply to a parliamentary question.  The policy, announced by Cameron’s coalition government in
June 2010, aims to save about 390 million pounds a year by 2015.
It’s part of a broader squeeze on the welfare budget aimed at
reducing Britain’s budget deficit.  “This is a deeply unfair change from a government that is
increasingly out of touch with parents feeling the squeeze and
struggling to juggle work and family life,” Rachel Reeves,
a lawmaker who speaks for Labour on economic matters, will tell
the shopworkers’ labor union, Usdaw, according to comments sent
by the party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
