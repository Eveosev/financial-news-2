A case of Vosne-Romanee Cros
Parantoux 1985 vintage Burgundy from the private cellar of
winemaker Henri Jayer fetched HK$2.06 million ($265,200) as the
top lot at a Christie’s International sale in  Hong Kong .  The  auction  was 100 percent sold and raised HK$66.03
million, including a 21 percent buyers’ premium, exceeding
Christie’s presale estimate of at least HK$20 million, the
auction house said in an e-mailed release last night.  The sale showed demand for rare Burgundy vintages even as
the Asian appetite for more accessible Bordeaux has cooled,
leaving prices for top Medoc producers 20 percent down on the
market highs of mid-2011. All bottles in the  Christie’s (CHRS)  auction
came from the private collection of Jayer, who bought his first
Vosne-Romanee vineyard in 1951 and became one of the best-known
vintners in the region for more than half a century.  “Tonight’s sale demonstrated the enduring passion of our
Asian clients for the wines of Burgundy,” Charles Curtis, head
of wine for Christie’s  Asia , said in the e-mailed statement.  The 12 bottles of Premier Cru Cros Parantoux, beating their
presale high estimate of HK$1 million, went to an Asian private
buyer, as did the other  top 10 lots  in the auction. A case of
1989 Cros Parantoux and another of Richebourg Grand Cru 1979
each sold for HK$1.82 million, also well above estimates.  The Christie’s sale followed auctions in Hong Kong last
month by  Sotheby’s (BID) ,  Zachys  and  Acker, Merrall & Condit  before
the Chinese New Year holiday. The Acker sale raised HK$66.87
million, Sotheby’s HK$44.06 million and Zachys HK$34.62 million.  Bonhams Sale  At a separate Bonhams sale in  London  on Feb. 9, Bordeaux
dominated the top three lots, with a case of Chateau Latour 1982
fetching 13,800 pounds ($21,800), including a 15 percent buyer’s
premium. Six bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild sold for
12,650 pounds and a case of Lafite 1986 for 10,925 pounds.  Auction buying became more selective last year as the  Liv-
ex Fine Wine 100 Index  dropped 15 percent. Since the start of
this year it has rallied, rising 1.4 percent in January for its
first monthly gain since June.  Hong Kong is the world’s largest wine auction market and is
closely watched as a barometer of global sentiment. Last year,
$198 million of wine was sold by the four biggest auction houses
in the city, more than double the $92 million they sold in  New
York , the second-largest center, according to Bloomberg News
calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
