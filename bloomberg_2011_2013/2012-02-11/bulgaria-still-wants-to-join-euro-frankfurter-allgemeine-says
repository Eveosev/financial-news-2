Bulgaria still wants to join the
euro in the medium-term provided countries that share the
currency stick to rules on debt,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung

wealthier nations through the European Stability Mechanism,
Traikov also told the newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
