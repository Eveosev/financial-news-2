National Bank of Kuwait  lowered its
forecast for  Saudi Arabia ’s economic growth this year to 3.8
percent from 5 percent, citing “revised assumptions” for the
kingdom’s oil production.  “As Libyan output recovers through 2012, some of these
increases may be reversed, not least to rebuild Saudi’s cushion
of spare production capacity to enable it to respond to future
shocks,”  Kuwait ’s largest lender said. Saudi Arabia raised
production last year by more than 1 million barrels a day to
offset a drop in Libyan supplies, the bank said.  Saudi inflation this year is expected to average 5 percent
to 6 percent, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
