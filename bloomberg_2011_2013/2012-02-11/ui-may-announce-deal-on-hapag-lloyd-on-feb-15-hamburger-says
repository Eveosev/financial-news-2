TUI AG (TUI1) , owner of  Europe ’s largest
travel company, may announce an agreement on the sale of part of
its stake in Hapag-Lloyd AG on Feb. 15 before the company’s
shareholder meeting,  Hamburger Abendblatt  reported.  TUI, which owns 38.4 percent of Hapag-Lloyd, plans to
“significantly” reduce its holding while continuing to retain
a stake in the shipping company, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people familiar with the discussions.  TUI may retain as much as 20 percent of Hapag-Lloyd,
 Hamburger Abendblatt  said. Hamburg-based Albert Ballin’s
investment group, which owns 61.6 percent, probably will
increase its stake, the newspaper reported.  “We are in good and advanced talks with the Hamburg
consortium,” said Robin Zimmermann, a spokesman for  TUI AG. (TUI1)   All parties may be informed about the details of the plan
this weekend and TUI’s supervisory board and the Hamburg senate
may meet on the evening of Feb. 14, the newspaper said. TUI’s
shareholder meeting is due to start at 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 15.  -- Editor: James Kraus  To contact the reporter on this story:
