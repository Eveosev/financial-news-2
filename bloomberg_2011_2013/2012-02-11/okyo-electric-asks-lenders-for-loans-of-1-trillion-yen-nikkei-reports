Tokyo Electric Power Co. and the
Japanese government’s nuclear disaster rescue fund asked lenders
for about 1 trillion yen ($12.9 billion) in loans, the Nikkei
newspaper reported.  The Nuclear Damage Liability Facilitation Fund is asking
for the loans to be advanced with no collateral or repayment
guarantees from the government, the Nikkei said, without
providing the source of the information.  The formal request to banks is part of a business plan to
avert Tepco’s collapse after the Fukushima disaste, which will
be completed in March, according to the report.    To contact the reporter on this story:
