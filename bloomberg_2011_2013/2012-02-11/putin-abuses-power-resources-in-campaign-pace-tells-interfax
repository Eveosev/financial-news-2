Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has
abused his “administrative resource” in the presidential
campaign, Interfax reported, citing the Parliamentary Assembly
of the  Council of Europe .  Observers from PACE have met four candidates for the
Russian presidency this week, while Vladimir Putin didn’t have
time for a meeting, Tiny Kox, head of the group’s election
mission, told the Moscow-based news agency today. PACE urges
Russia to hold “fair elections” on March 4, Interfax said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
