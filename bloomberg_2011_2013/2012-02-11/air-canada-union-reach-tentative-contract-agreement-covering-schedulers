Air Canada (AC/A)  and the Canadian Auto
Workers Union reached a tentative agreement covering 75 in-
flight crew schedulers, the union said in a statement.  Terms of the agreement wonâ€™t be released until members have
ratified the pact, the CAW said in a CNS statement. The
ratification vote is expected to take place next week and the
results released on Feb. 15, the union said.  The latest agreement comes a day after the airline and its
largest union, the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers, reached agreement on a pact covering about
8,600 employees.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
