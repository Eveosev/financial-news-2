Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has asked for a nationwide review of land management
procedures and said local authorities made mistakes in a land
acquisition case in the northern port city of Haiphong,
according to  a statement  on the government’s website.  Local authorities in cities and provinces should “focus on
the proper settlement of complaints of citizens” in land-
acquisition cases, Dung said in the statement, dated yesterday.
Responsible ministries were asked to review  land use  and
management regulations and propose amendments to laws “to suit
the actual situation,” according to the statement.  Land management procedures in the country are inadequate,
with many cases related to land use not being resolved in a
timely manner, Dung said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
