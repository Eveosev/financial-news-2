Republican presidential candidate
 Mitt Romney  won a straw poll sponsored by the Conservative
Political Action Conference and the Washington Times.  Front-runner Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, was
the choice of 38 percent of the conservative activists surveyed.
The survey polled 3,408 CPAC participants at the 39th annual
CPAC gathering in Washington, which drew about 10,000 people  CPAC, hosted by the non-profit American Conservative Union
Foundation, attracts Republicans motivated by cutting taxes and
ending abortion rights, a voting bloc that has questioned
Romney’s commitment to their causes.  Rick Santorum , fresh off victories in Colorado, Minnesota
and Missouri, came in second with 31 percent. Former House
Speaker  Newt Gingrich  came in third with 15 percent of the vote.  U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas, who won the group’s
2010 and 2011 straw polls, received 12 percent of the vote. Paul
was the only one of the four remaining Republican presidential
candidates to decline an invitation to speak at this year’s
conference.  Maine Republicans are preparing to announce the results of
their non-binding caucuses for the party’s nominee tonight.  The CPAC poll, conducted by Fabrizio, McLaughlin and
Associates, was taken between 9 a.m. Feb. 9 and 1 p.m. today.
Pollster Tony Fabrizio said 44 percent of those surveyed were
students and 97 percent disapproved of Democratic President
Barack Obama’s performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
