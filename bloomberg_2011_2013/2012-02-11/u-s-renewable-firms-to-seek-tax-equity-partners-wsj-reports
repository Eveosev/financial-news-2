The U.S. administration will explain
benefits of renewable energy investments to companies, including
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , after the incentive
program for the industry expired, the Wall Street Journal
reported.  The Energy Department invited 79 executives from companies
with large tax bills in the U.S. for a March 13 meeting, the
newspaper said, citing a Feb. 6 letter from Richard Kauffman, a
senior adviser to Energy Secretary Steven Chu.  Chu is scheduled to tell the companies about attractive
rates of return and brand benefits that come with entering so-
called tax-equity markets in renewable energy, the Journal said.  The Energy Department is seeking ways to promote investment
by companies in industries that will create the clean energy
jobs of the future, the Journal said, citing a department
statement. The effort to help renewable energy companies claim
more subsidies may draw criticism, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
