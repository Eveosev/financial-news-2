South Africa’s President  Jacob Zuma 
said new banknotes in the country will bear the image of former
president  Nelson Mandela .  Zuma made the announcement in  Pretoria  today on the 22nd
anniversary of the release from prison of the Nobel Laureate who
led the country out of apartheid to become its first black
president in 1994.  “It is a befitting tribute to the man who became a symbol
of his country’s struggle for human rights and democracy,” Zuma
said.  Mandela, 93, spent 27 years in prison for plotting the
overthrow of segregationist rule and served as president before
stepping down in 1999 after one five-year term. He is now
retired from public life after campaigning for children’s
rights, global peace and greater access to treatment for AIDS
sufferers.  South Africa ’s Constitution allows for no more than
two presidential terms.  Mandela’s image will be on all banknotes, replacing
pictures of the so-called big five African animals -- the rhino,
elephant, lion, buffalo and leopard.  South Africa’s rand extended declines by almost 1
percentage point to a low of 7.7847 to the dollar yesterday
after the central bank announced on its website it would hold a
press conference with Zuma, central bank Governor  Gill Marcus 
and Pravin Gordhan to make an announcement of “national
importance,” without giving details. The currency traded at
7.7493 as of midnight local time.  Marcus said she regretted the market speculation about the
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
