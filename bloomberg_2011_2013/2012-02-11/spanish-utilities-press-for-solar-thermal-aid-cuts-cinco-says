Spanish power companies are lobbying
the government to cut subsidies for solar thermal power plants,
 Cinco Dias  reported.  The utilitiesâ€™ lobby group urged the government to postpone
payment of aid for 1,200 megawatts of previously approved
projects to generate power from solar mirrors that escaped the
renewable energy moratorium announced last month, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified industry officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
