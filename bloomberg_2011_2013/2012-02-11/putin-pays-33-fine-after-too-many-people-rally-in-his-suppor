Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  paid a
1,000-ruble ($33) fine after too many people turned out to rally
for him in Moscow, state television Rossiya 24 reported.  As many as 138,000 people attended the rally Feb. 4,
exceeding the 15,000 approved by the city, according to police.
A Moscow court fined the organizers for the violation, which
Putin himself decided to pay, according to RIA Novosti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
