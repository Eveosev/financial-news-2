ICP Asset Management LLC and founder
 Thomas Priore  were sued in New York, accused by fund liquidators
of misusing $36.5 million in assets to satisfy margin calls made
on a collateralized debt obligation.  ICP managed multibillion dollar collateralized debt
obligations known as Triaxx CDOs that invested in mortgage-
backed securities. As the value of the securities fell, one of
the CDOs that borrowed money under a repurchase agreement faced
margin calls, according to a complaint filed today in state
court in  Manhattan .  “The funds had no obligation to meet such margin calls,
and ICP Management and Priore, acting on both sides of the
transaction, took no steps to protect the funds,” said
liquidators of the two funds, ICP Strategic Credit Income Master
Fund Ltd. and ICP Strategic Credit Income Fund Ltd.  Priore and ICP were sued in 2010 by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, which accused them of directing more than
$1 billion of trades by the Triaxx CDOs at what they knew were
inflated prices, according to the complaint.  Anne Rucker, a lawyer for ICP and Priore in the SEC case,
didn’t immediately return phone and e-mail messages seeking
comment on the new complaint after regular business.  The case is ICP Strategic Credit Income Master Fund Ltd. v.
ICP Asset Management LLC, 650385-2012,  New York  State Supreme
Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
