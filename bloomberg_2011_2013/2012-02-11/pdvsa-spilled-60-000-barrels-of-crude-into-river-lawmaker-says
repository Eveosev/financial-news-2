Venezuelan opposition lawmaker Hiram
Gaviria said state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA spilled
60,000 barrels of crude oil from a pipeline into almost 140
kilometers (87 miles) of the Guarapiche River in eastern Monagas
state.  About 70 percent of the residents of Maturin, the state
capital, have lost their drinking water supply since the  oil
spill  occurred last week, Gaviria said on  Union Radio . Members
of congress’s environmental committee, which Gaviria heads, will
visit Maturin Feb. 13, Union Radio reported.  A spokesperson at PDVSA, as the company is known, declined
to comment on the lawmaker’s remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
