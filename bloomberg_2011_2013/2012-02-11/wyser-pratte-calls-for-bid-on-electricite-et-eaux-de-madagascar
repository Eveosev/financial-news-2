Guy Wyser-Pratte  called for a public
tender offer for  Electricite et Eaux de Madagascar (EEM) , or EEM, by
Groupe Verneuil, according to an e-mailed statement from Paris-
based lawyers BCW & Associes on his behalf.  Wyser-Pratte is asking France’s financial regulator
Autorite des Marches Financiers to determine that a group of
 shareholders  consisting of EEM Chief Executive Officer Francois
Gontier, Chief Operating Officer Frederic Doulcet, Verneuil
Participation and FD Conseils et Participations jointly breached
a threshold of 30 percent ownership, the lawyers wrote.  “Mr. Wyser-Pratte demands the deposition without delay by
Groupe Verneuil of a public offer for all of the capital of
EEM,” BCW & Associes wrote.  A shareholder group led by Wyser-Pratte on Jan. 19 cut its
stake in EEM to 15.4 percent from more than 20 percent and its
 voting rights  to 12.6 percent from more than 15 percent,
according to a Jan. 27 regulatory statement by the AMF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
