Australia  will rely on income from
its tax on mining profits to bolster the economy as gains in the
currency hit manufacturing jobs, the  Australian Financial Review 
reported, citing an interview with Treasurer  Wayne Swan .  Assistance will probably focus on protecting jobs and
helping workers rather than employers in areas hurt by the rise
in the Australian dollar, the newspaper said.  The government has ruled out further aid to aluminum
production, one of the hardest-hit sectors, and wonâ€™t implement
industry-specific tax breaks, the Financial Review said.  Rising government revenue from a tax on commodity earnings
will underpin changes to other areas of the tax system designed
to help businesses cope with the currency impact, the newspaper
reported, citing Swan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
