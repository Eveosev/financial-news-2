Spanish hospitals risk having their
drug supplies cut off because they’ve accumulated unpaid bills
of more than 6 billion euros ($7.9 billion), El Pais reported.  Some companies have already stopped selling pharmaceuticals
to the regions of Valencia and Andalucia because they have
failed to pay for products used more than two years ago, the
newspaper said, citing a speech by Humberto Arnes, director of
the pharmaceutical industry’s lobby group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
