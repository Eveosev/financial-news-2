Thailand’s  PTT Pcl (PTT)  will support a
plan by  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB)  and  Muhibbah (MUHI)  Engineering Bhd.
to revive the stalled Asian Petroleum Hub bunkering facility in
Malaysia, the Edge newspaper said, citing people it didn’t name.  PTT will continue to honor its 15-year offtake agreement
with Asian Petroleum Hub as long as the project in Malaysia’s
southern Johor state is revived and completed, the report said.
The project was placed under receivership by its biggest
creditor, CIMB, which is working with Muhibbah, a subcontractor,
to revive it, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
