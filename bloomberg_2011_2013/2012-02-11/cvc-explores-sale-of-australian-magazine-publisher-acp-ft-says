CVC Capital Partners Ltd. is
exploring a sale of ACP,  Australia â€™s biggest magazine publisher,
in a bid to restructure the debt of its parent company Nine
Entertainment Co., the Financial Times reported, citing people
with knowledge of the process.  A Goldman Sachs fund that funded the majority of its debt
is working with CVC to find possible buyers that might include
Hearst Corp, the U.S. publisher of Elle magazine, the newspaper
said.  CVC, which owns 99 percent of Nine, declined to comment on
a possible sale, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
