Spanish power companies say they
have lost 2 billion euros ($2.6 billion) because of a revenue
shortfall in the country’s electricity system as they pressure
the government to raise power prices, Expansion said.  The utilities are using this analysis to argue they have
been the main victims of the so-called tariff deficit in
negotiations with the government over changes to the power
system, Expansion reported, citing a report the companies filed
to government officials.  Link to newspaper’s website: { http://www.expansion.com/ }  To contact the reporter on this story:
