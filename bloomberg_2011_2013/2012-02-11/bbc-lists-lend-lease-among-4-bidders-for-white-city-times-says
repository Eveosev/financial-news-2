Lend Lease Corp. (LLC) , Australia’s
largest property developer, is among four bidders shortlisted
for The British Broadcasting Corp.’s headquarters in west
London, the Times reported, without citing anyone.  The shortlist includes Stanhope, a developer backed by
Japan’s Mitsui Fudosan, Sir Stuart Lipton’s Chelsfield Partners
and Resolution Property, the Times said.  Lend Lease  is building
the London 2012 Olympic Games athletes’ village, the Times said.  The BBC is close to completing a sale of the 14-acre (5.7-
hectare) site in the White City district, the newspaper said.
The world’s largest public broadcaster plans to work with the
winning bidder on a wider development of the site, the Times
said.  The BBC, advised by London-based broker  Lambert Smith
Hampton , is selling the center to raise funds to cover a six-
year freeze on license fees, the newspaper reported. The sale
will allow the  BBC  to save 20 million pounds ($31.5 million) a
year and help meet its target of reducing its property portfolio
by about a third, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
