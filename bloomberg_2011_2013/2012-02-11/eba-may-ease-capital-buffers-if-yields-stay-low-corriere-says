European banking regulators may ease
capital buffer requirements if a drop in sovereign-debt yields
proves lasting,  Il Corriere della Sera  reported, citing European
Banking Authority Chairman Andrea Enria.  The authority will consider reviewing the sovereign buffer
if the ongoing drop in sovereign-debt spreads “is of structural
and lasting nature,”  Corriere cited Enria as saying.  The EBA in December told banks to raise 114.7 billion euros
($151 billion) in capital by the end of June in response to a
fall in the value of securities sold by euro-area governments.
The agency required banks to keep a core Tier-1 capital ratio of
9 percent and hold additional reserves, called a sovereign
buffer, against the debt of weaker euro-area countries, based on
the market price of the bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
