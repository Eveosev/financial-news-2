Mexico ’s peso had its biggest drop
this year on concern that plans to help  Greece  avoid default
were breaking down, curbing demand for higher-yielding emerging-
market assets.  The peso weakened 1 percent to 12.8021 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close in Mexico City, from 12.6708 yesterday. This
represents the biggest loss since Dec. 27. The peso has jumped
8.9 percent this year, the second-most among a basket of 25
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The peso has
declined 1.1 percent this week.  Emergency talks of euro-area finance chiefs broke up late
last night with Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
saying Greece must turn its budget cuts into law, flesh out 325
million euros ($429 million) in spending reductions and have its
major party leaders sign on to the program before upcoming
elections. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told
lawmakers in Berlin today that Greece is missing its debt-
cutting targets, according to two people who took part in the
meeting.  “The market expected a quicker, more concrete solution”
for Greece,  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA in
Monterrey, Mexico, said in a telephone interview. “It hasn’t
happened. That’s why we’re seeing this drop.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
rose 11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.54 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of the
securities dropped 1.1 centavo to 129.92 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
