Fraport (FRA)  AG wants to encourage
airlines to use quieter airplanes at Frankfurt airport by making
landing fees more dependent on noise levels of the aircraft,
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported.  A total of 92 homeowners living close to the airport have
decided to sell their houses to Fraport so far, the German
newspaper reported in an e-mailed summary of an article, citing
Stefan Schulte, the companyâ€™s chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
