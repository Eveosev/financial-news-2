The European Financial Stability
Facility will supply a “significant” portion of aid needed for
 Greece ’s rescue, WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing EFSF Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Christophe Frankel.  The EFSF will make its contribution in coming months and
the period thereafter, the German magazine cited Frankel as
saying in an e-mailed summary of an article.  Asian investors are “positive” about the EFSF’s bonds and
the disproportionate share of European investors in the rescue
fund’s January bond sale isn’t representative, Frankel said in
an interview, according to WirtschaftsWoche.  The EFSF can suggest maturities of more than 10 years on
its bonds to investors after negotiations on Greece’s debt swap
are concluded, the magazine cited Frankel as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
