The pound declined against the
dollar and euro this week as the  Bank of England  boosted its
bond-purchase program amid signs U.K. growth is stalling.  Gilts completed a weekly gain after the central bank said
it will pump another 50 billion pounds ($79.1 billion) into the
economy as the growth outlook remains “weak.” Gross domestic
product probably shrank 0.2 percent this quarter, according to
the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, whose
clients include the Bank of England and the Treasury.  “The quantitative easing is a negative force on the
pound,” said  Gavin Friend , a markets strategist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in London. “We are not positive on the
outlook. The pound should underperform.”  The U.K. currency declined 0.4 percent this week to $1.5752
as of 4:44 p.m.  London  time yesterday, after rising 3.2 percent
over the previous three weeks. Sterling dropped 0.6 percent to
83.71 pence per euro after falling to 84.07 pence yesterday, the
weakest since Jan. 30.  Britain’s currency has depreciated 1.2 percent this year
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The pound has declined 4.2
percent in the past 12 months.  The Monetary Policy Committee raised the target for bond
purchases to 325 billion pounds on Feb. 9, more than a quarter
of current outstanding gilts, according to a statement in
London. The Committee also held its benchmark  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent.  Yields Fall  The  yield  on the 10-year gilt fell five basis points this
week to 2.13 percent. The 3.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2021 gained 0.44, or 4.40 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 113.965.  Gilts may extend their advance next week before a
government report that economists said will show inflation
slowed in January. Price gains eased to 3.6 percent from 4.2
percent in December, according to a Bloomberg survey before the
Office for National Statistics data on Feb. 14. The BOE will
release new economic and inflation forecasts the following day.  Gilts have handed investors a 2.3 percent loss this year,
while German  government bonds  have slipped 1.1 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The U.K. is scheduled to auction 1.75 billion pounds of
2034 bonds on Jan. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
