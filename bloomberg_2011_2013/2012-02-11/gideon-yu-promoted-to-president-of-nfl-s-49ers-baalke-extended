The  San Francisco  49ers signed
General Manager Trent Baalke to a three-year contract extension
through the 2016 season and promoted Gideon Yu to president and
co-owner, the team said.  Baalke took over in January 2011 as general manager for the
49ers, who reached the National Football Conference’s
championship game this season. He is in his eighth year with the
team.  Yu was a general partner at Khosla Ventures, a venture
capital company based in  Menlo Park , California, until joining
the 49ers as chief strategy officer last April.  Yu, previously chief financial officer at Facebook Inc. and
YouTube LLC, has focused in the past year on securing funding
for the 49ers’ proposed new $1 billion stadium in  Santa Clara ,
 California .  “He’s both a visionary and the ‘go-to’ guy who can lead us
through the enormous opportunities ahead, such as the stadium
construction, expansion of our brand and its businesses and
positioning the franchise for the future,” Chief Executive
Officer Jed York said in a team release.  The 49ers did not say how much of an ownership stake Yu
will have in the team.  Yu will be responsible for all business operations. He and
Baalke, who will lead the team’s football operations, both will
report to York, the team said in its release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
