Swiss banks are under great
pressure’’ to conform to tax laws,  Neue Zuercher Zeitung 
reported, citing Swiss Bankers Association Chairman  Patrick Odier .  Odier added in an interview that it was understood that a
company that operates in a “grey area” has no future.
Domestically-focused institutions also have suddenly found
themselves in a situation that previously was perceived as a
problem for big banks, the newspaper cited him as saying.  He also told NZZ his goal is to preserve banking jobs in
 Switzerland  and prevent banking business from moving abroad.  The official expressed regret that some Swiss banks took on
clients from  UBS AG (UBSN)  and said that Bank Wegelin & Co. clearly
acted contrary to the strategy of the financial center if the
indictments prove to be true, NZZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
