Manchester United  beat Liverpool 2-1
to move into first place in English soccer’s Premier League.  Wayne Rooney scored twice early in the second half as
United moved one point ahead of Manchester City, which visits
Aston Villa tomorrow.  Luis Suarez  scored the Liverpool goal.  Prior to the game, Suarez refused to shake the hand of
United captain Patrice Evra in their first meeting since the
Liverpool striker was suspended for racially abusing the
defender in an October game. United’s Rio Ferdinand then refused
to shake Suarez’s hand.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
