Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen
Harper  said European nations shouldn’t rely on other countries
to help them fund a resolution to the debt crisis in the region,
a position he said is also supported by  China .  Harper, speaking to reporters in Chongqing, China, at the
end of a four-day visit to the country, said he discussed the
issue in his meetings this week with Chinese leaders.  “Europe is a rich series of economies that have the
capacity of directly addressing the issues that lie before
them,” Harper said, in response to a question of whether the
 International Monetary Fund  should do more to help Europe. “And
without speaking for the Chinese government, I think it would be
fair to say that they would broadly agree with our assessment of
the situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
