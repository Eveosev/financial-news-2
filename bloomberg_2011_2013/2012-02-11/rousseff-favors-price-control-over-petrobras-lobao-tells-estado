Brazil plans to keep fuel prices
unchanged even after state-run oil producer  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4)  reported declining profit because President  Dilma Rousseff 
prefers inflation under control to “fantastic” earnings,
Energy Minister Edison Lobao told  O Estado de S.Paulo in an
interview.  Lobao said that outgoing Chief Executive Officer Jose
Sergio Gabrielli acted “correctly” in pushing for fuel price
increases, while it’s Rousseff’s job to put the interests of the
entire nation above those of the state-run company, according to
Estado.  To contact the reporter on this story:
