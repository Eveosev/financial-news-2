(Corrects story published yesterday to say Computer
Sciences has given notice to workers after Ritzau corrected its
original report on the matter.)  Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  has given
notice to 300 workers in Denmark from April 1 after TDC A/S
canceled a system support service contract and hired India’s
 Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS)  instead, newswire  Ritzau 
reported, citing unions and a spokeswoman for the company.  Computer Sciences doesn’t know if any of the 300 workers
will be taken over by Tata, Ritzau quoted Charlotte Lundblad, a
spokeswoman for the Falls Church, Virginia-based company, as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
