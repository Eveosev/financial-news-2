U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
has agreed not to publicly criticize bonuses at  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the Financial Times
reported, citing a “coalition official.”  Cameron made the decision with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and senior government officials on Feb. 7 to repair
strained relations with the City, the  newspaper  said. Bonuses at
RBS are estimated to be worth 500 million pounds ($787 million),
the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
