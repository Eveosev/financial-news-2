Incitec Pivot Ltd. (IPL) ,  Australia ’s
largest fertilizer maker, rose to the highest in almost three
weeks in Sydney trading after the Australian Financial Review
said the company got an informal approach for its fertilizer
unit.  Melbourne-based Incitec rose 1.8 percent to A$2.83
at 1:07 p.m. local time, the highest since June 4 and giving it
a market value of A$4.6 billion ($4.2 billion). Earlier it added
as much as 3.6 percent. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index
declined 1.4 percent.  The company has had at least one informal approach for the
fertilizer unit, which may be worth as much as A$2 billion, the
newspaper reported in its Street Talk column, without citing
anyone. The unnamed prospective buyer was working with advisers
and talks are at an early stage, it said.  Incitec Pivot spokesman Stewart Murrihy declined to comment
on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
