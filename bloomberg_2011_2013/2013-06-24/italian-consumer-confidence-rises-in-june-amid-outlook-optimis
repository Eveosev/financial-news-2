Italian household confidence rose
this month as consumers grew optimistic about the country’s
outlook as Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government plans to cut
taxes and boost youth employment.  The  confidence index  increased in June to 95.7, the highest
since March 2012, from a revised 86.4 in May, the Italian
statistics office Istat said in  Rome  today. Economists had
forecast a reading of 86.2, according to the median of 10
projections in a Bloomberg News survey.  Prime Minister Enrico Letta is pushing a more expansive
economic policy as he looks to spur an economy grappling with
the fallout from former Prime Minister Mario Monti’s austerity
policies. Letta froze the payment of a property tax due this
month and also signaled he may cut levies on labor.  The euro region’s third-biggest economy contracted more
than initially reported in the first quarter as the slump sapped
household demand. Consumer spending declined 0.3 percent in the
period and joblessness increased in April to the highest in more
than 36 years.  The government is also trying to postpone an increase of
the value-added tax in July for at least three months, a delay
that would cost Italy 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), Finance
Undersecretary Pier Paolo Baretta said June 18.  Istat originally reported the  consumer confidence  index at
85.9 in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
