Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
forecasts for gold through 2014 after selling quickened as
investors priced in expectations of reduced asset purchases by
the U.S. Federal Reserve.  The bank cut its target for the end of this year to $1,300
an ounce from $1,435 and lowered its prediction to $1,050 from
$1,270 for the end of 2014. Investors are assuming an earlier
tapering of quantitative easing and a Fed fund rate increase
sooner than the bank’s economists expect, analysts Damien Courvalin and  Jeffrey Currie  wrote in a report dated yesterday.  Gold has fallen 23 percent this year, heading for the
biggest annual drop since 1981, as speculation increased that
the Fed would pare monetary stimulus that helped the metal cap a
12-year bull run last year. Prices slumped to the lowest since
September 2010 last week after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
the central bank may slow its bond-buying program if the  U.S.
economy  continues to improve.  “The momentum in gold prices leaves risk to current prices
as skewed to the downside,” the analysts wrote. “Medium term,
we expect that gold prices will decline further given our U.S.
economists’ forecast for improving economic activity and a less
accommodative monetary policy stance.”  Gold for August delivery on the Comex in  New York  slid 0.7
percent to $1,282.60 an ounce as of 1:41 p.m. in  Singapore  after
tumbling to $1,268.70 on June 21, the least expensive since
Sept. 16, 2010. Investors sold 533.3 metric tons from bullion-backed  exchange-traded products  this year, wiping out more than
$54 billion from the value of the funds.  ETP Slump  Holdings in ETPs declined to 2,098.605 tons on June 21, the
least since February 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Assets are down 20 percent in 2013 after climbing
every year since the first product was listed in 2003. Goldman
expects ETPs to decline at a steady pace of 1 million ounces a
month, “slightly below their recent pace but twice as fast as
we had previously expected,” the analysts wrote.  Goldman joins Credit Suisse Group AG and Societe Generale
SA in predicting further declines. Prices will drop to an
average of $1,200 in the fourth quarter, Societe Generale
forecasts. Credit Suisse sees the metal at $1,100 in 12 months,
according to Ric Deverell, head of commodities research.  In April, when gold entered a  bear market , a buying frenzy
from  China  to  India  and the U.S. followed the biggest price drop
in 30 years, driving prices up more than $150 an ounce.  Russia 
and  South Korea  were among nations that added gold to reserves
this year, after central banks around the world bought 534.6
tons last year, the most since 1964, according to World Gold
Council estimates.  “We continue to expect that continued central bank gold
buying will not be sufficient to offset this decline in
prices,” the analysts wrote. “Further, we would expect this
decline in prices to coincide with rising jewelry demand, which
we view as price responsive and not price setting.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
