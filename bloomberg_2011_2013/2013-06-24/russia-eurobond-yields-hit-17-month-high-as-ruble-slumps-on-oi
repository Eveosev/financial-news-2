Russian Eurobond yields jumped to
the highest in more than a year and the ruble weakened as oil
fell on concern economic growth in  China  may be threatened by
cash constraints.  The ruble dropped 0.4 percent against the dollar to 32.9225
by 11:50 a.m. in Moscow, the eighth worst performance among 24
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The currency
lost 0.2 percent versus the central bank’s dollar-euro basket to
37.5341. The yield on  Russia ’s Eurobonds due March 2030 climbed
16 basis points to 4.48 percent, the highest since January 2012.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and China International Capital
Corp. cut their 2013 economic growth forecasts for China to 7.4
percent as a cash squeeze in the banking system risks
exacerbating an economic slowdown. Brent oil tumbled 0.6 percent
to $100.36 per barrel, falling as low as $99.82 today. Crude and
natural gas provide about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue.  “The situation with the Chinese slowdown is driving oil
below $100 today,” Igor Akinshin, a foreign exchange trader at
 Alfa Bank , said by phone from Moscow. “There are no drivers for
the ruble, the weakening trend persists, people are selling the
currency.”  The Russian currency and debt joined a global market rout
last week after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the regulator
may start reducing bond purchases that have fueled asset-price
gains, and end the program in 2014 should risks to the  U.S.
economy  abate.  Russia’s central bank started buying rubles on May 29 to
slow its slide. Bank Rossii, which reports currency intervention
data with a delay and steps up interventions if the ruble
weakens beyond certain levels,  spent  the equivalent of 6.54
billion rubles ($199 million) of foreign currency on June 20, it
said today.  Rising Yields  The yield on benchmark ruble bonds due 2027 jumped 20 basis
points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 8.25 percent, the highest
since September.  The Finance Ministry is set to announce today the amount
and the maturity of ruble bonds it plans to auction June 26. The
government plans to sell 40 billion rubles ($1.2 billion) of
three-year OFZs in the third quarter, the most for that maturity
since the first three months of 2012, according  Finance Ministry 
statements last week. Russia is targeting a total of 270 billion
rubles of OFZs in the third quarter.  Investors are pulling money from  emerging markets  at the
fastest pace in two years. More than $19 billion left funds
investing in developing-nation assets in the three weeks to June
12, the most since 2011, according to EPFR Global.  To contact the reporter on this story:
