The cost of insuring  Indonesia ’s
debt against default dropped by the most since October 2011 as
the government raised subsidized fuel prices, reducing pressure
on the budget and current-account deficits.  Five-year  credit-default swaps  on sovereign bonds fell 24
basis points to 243 on June 21 in  New York , according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. That pared their
gain this quarter to 80 basis points.  Gasoline and diesel prices were increased by 44 percent and
22 percent, respectively, Energy and Mineral Resources Minister
Jero Wacik said late June 21. Indonesia’s credit rating may be
raised if fuel reforms are finalized,  Standard & Poor’s  said in
a May 2 statement as it cut the outlook to stable from positive.  “There is a likelihood that S&P may restore Indonesia’s
outlook to positive after the fiscal improvement,” said Rully
Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in
Jakarta. “Indonesia’s prospects are very positive now, but
there are still external worries weighing on investor
sentiment.”  S&P rates Indonesia at its highest junk level of BB+, the
only one of the three major ratings companies not to assess the
country as investment grade. The fuel-price increase is credit
positive as it lowers subsidy costs and keeps the  budget deficit 
below the legal limit of 3 percent, Moody’s Investors Service
analysts led by Christian de Guzman in  Singapore  wrote in a
report today.  Bonds Drop  The government predicted inflation will reach 7.2 percent
in its revised state budget, from an initial estimate of 4.9
percent, because of the costlier fuel. Consumer prices rose 5.47
percent in May, official data show.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 rose 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 7.08 percent as of
9:38 a.m. in Jakarta, the highest since October 2011, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  The fuel-price increase will reduce oil imports, improve
the  trade balance  and boost the rupiah to meet the budget
assumption for an average 2013 rate of 9,600 per dollar, Finance
Minister Chatib Basri said in a June 19 interview.  The rupiah was little changed at 9,928 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched 9,958 on
June 18, the weakest level since 2009.  The spot rate traded at a 4.2 percent premium to its one-month non-deliverable forwards, which gained 0.1 percent to
10,360, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility in the rupiah, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose 39 basis points to
16.04 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
