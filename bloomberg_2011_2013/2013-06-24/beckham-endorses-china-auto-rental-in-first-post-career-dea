David Beckham  agreed to endorse
China Auto Rental Holdings Inc. in his first advertising
agreement since ending his career as a soccer player, according
to IMG Worldwide Inc., which said it brokered the partnership.  The 38-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid
midfielder said on May 16 he would quit playing after a five-month contract with Paris Saint-Germain.  Beckham, soccer’s top-earning player last year according to
France Football magazine, today ended a seven-day visit to China
to promote the country’s soccer league, IMG said.  China Auto, which says it’s the country’s biggest car-rental provider, postponed an initial public offering in the
U.S. last year after struggling to attract investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
