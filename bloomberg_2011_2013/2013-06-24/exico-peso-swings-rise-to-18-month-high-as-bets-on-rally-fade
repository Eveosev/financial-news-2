Mexican peso volatility climbed to
the highest level in 18 months as futures traders’ bets on gains
in the currency tumbled amid concern the  Federal Reserve  will
reduce a stimulus program that has lowered U.S. yields.  One-month historical volatility, a measure of the magnitude
of the peso’s fluctuations during the period, rose to 16.133
percent at 9:14 a.m. in Mexico City, the highest since December
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency fell
0.8 percent to 13.4107 per dollar, the weakest level on a
closing basis since July 2012.  The peso and local bonds have tumbled since Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  told reporters June 19 that U.S. policy makers
may start tapering their bond buying program known as
quantitative easing this year.  “The market definitely got very nervous over what the Fed
said,”  Ramon Cordova , a trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro
Garza Garcia, Mexico, said in a telephone interview. “It’s
aggressively pricing that quantitative easing will end or get
reduced in September and rates will go up in 2014.”  The yields on benchmark government peso bonds maturing in
2024 rose 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 6.16
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
1.35 centavo to 131.56 centavos per peso.  Futures traders  cut net bets  on a peso advance against the
dollar to 20,949 last week, the lowest since July 2012, data
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on June 21.  Yields on inflation-linked debt maturing in December 2014
climbed five basis points to 0.71 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico ’s consumer prices unexpectedly fell 0.05 percent in
the first two weeks of June, the national statistics agency said
today on its website. The median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg for an increase of 0.10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
