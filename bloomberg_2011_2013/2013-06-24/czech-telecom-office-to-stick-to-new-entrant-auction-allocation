The Czech Telecommunications Office
will stick to its plan to allocate radio frequencies to a new
entrant in a rerun spectrum auction by the end of July over the
objections of current operators, the regulator said.  The Prague-based regulator, also known as CTU, will set
aside two blocks of the 800 MHz bandwidth for a new player, as
spelled out in disputed rules, it said a statement published on
its website today. CTU also introduced a new maximum cap for all
players to buy two blocks of the 800 MHz bandwidth, the most
crucial for building a country-wide 4G network, it said.  The office had a month to consider complaints about the
rules from existing providers during a six-week public
discussion period. The regulator previously canceled the sale of
800 MHz, 1,800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz spectra over concerns that
bids totaling more than 20 billion koruna ($1 billion) were too
high and would slow investment and boost costs for customers
through higher charges.  Operators across the globe are rushing to build faster
mobile networks based on Long Term Evolution, or LTE, technology
that will enable consumers to use enhanced services to shop
online and to communicate better.  Existing operators T-Mobile Czech Republic AS, Telefonica
and Vodafone Czech Republic bid for the licenses along with PPF
Mobile Services AS, a newcomer to the local market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
