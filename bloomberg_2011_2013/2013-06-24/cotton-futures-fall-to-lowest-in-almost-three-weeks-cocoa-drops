Cotton futures fell to the lowest in
almost three weeks on speculation that a slowing economy in
 China , the world’s biggest user, will curb demand. Cocoa and
orange juice also declined.  China’s benchmark money-market rates tumbled for a second
day, extending a retreat from record highs, on signs that
targeted injections of funds are being used to ease a cash
crunch that threatens to worsen an economic slowdown. Global
equities and most raw materials resumed the slide begun last
week after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank will ease stimulus measures should the economy
continue to improve.  “External macroeconomic drivers are putting pressure” on
prices, Gary Raines, a vice president of economics and analysis
at FCStone LLC in Nashville,  Tennessee , said in a telephone
interview. “Concern that China’s imports will slow had been
there for a while, and with the volatility in other markets,
cotton is going along for the ride.”  Cotton for December delivery slumped 1.6 percent to 83.3
cents a pound at 11:26 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 83.11 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since June 6.  China’s cotton imports in May tumbled 31 percent from a
year earlier, the nation’s customs agency said last week. By
July 31, 2014, the country’s stockpiles will climb 18 percent to
58.93 million bales, or about 64 percent of the world’s total,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. A bale weighs 480
pounds, or 218 kilograms.  Also in  New York , cocoa futures for September delivery fell
less than 0.1 percent to $2,150 a metric ton. Earlier, the price
touched $2,135, the lowest for a most-active contract since
April 5.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery declined 0.7
percent to $1.405 a pound, heading for the sixth straight drop,
the longest slump since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
