Cohort Plc (CHRT) , which provides
communications systems for Britain’s Astute attack submarines,
said it’s ready to pursue purchases after a rebound in profit.  “We see real opportunities for acquisitions,” Andy Thomis,
chief executive officer of Theale, England-based Cohort, said in
a phone interview. “We’ve been very much focused on operational
improvements, but our focus is moving to driving growth.”  Cohort  stock  was trading 9.5 percent higher at 150.50 pence
as of 1:05 p.m. in  London , the biggest gain since June 15 last
year, after the company said operating profit jumped 13 percent
to 7.3 million pound in the 12 months ended April 30. Net cash
stood at 16.4 million pounds at the year’s end, up 16 percent.  Middle East sales of the Typhoon combat aircraft, built by
 BAE Systems Plc (BA/) ,  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  and European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co., could boost the share of revenue generated
by exports beyond last year’s 10 percent, with Cohort chasing
other “good opportunities” for overseas deals, Thomis said.  Overall order intake also should be stronger this year,
aided by an increase in space activities as Britain increases
contributions to the  European Space Agency  after two years of
“disappointment” in that sector, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
