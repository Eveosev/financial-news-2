The U.S. Supreme Court accepted a
case that promises to redefine the speech rights of abortion
opponents, agreeing to rule on a Massachusetts law that creates
a 35-foot buffer zone around clinic entrances.  The justices today said they will hear an appeal from
abortion foes seeking to overturn the Massachusetts law as a
violation of the First Amendment. The challengers say they have
a right to hand out leaflets and start conversations with women
entering abortion clinics.  A Boston-based federal appeals court upheld the measure,
pointing to a 2000 Supreme Court decision that upheld Colorado
restrictions on abortion clinic protests.  Massachusetts enacted the law in 2007, strengthening an
existing measure that had required a 6-foot buffer zone at
abortion clinics. The new law makes it a crime to “knowingly
enter or remain” in an area within 35 feet of a clinic
entrance, exit or driveway. The measure exempts clinic employees
and people entering or leaving the facility.  The high court’s membership has changed significantly since
the 2000 decision. Most notably, two members of that 6-3
majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, are no longer on the court. Their successors, Chief
Justice John Roberts and Justice  Samuel Alito , are often
sympathetic to free-speech claims.  The justices will hear arguments and rule in their 2013-14
term, which starts in October.  The case is McCullen v. Coakley, 12-1168.  To contact the reporter on this story:
