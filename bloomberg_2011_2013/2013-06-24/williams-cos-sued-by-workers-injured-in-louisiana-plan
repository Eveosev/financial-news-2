Williams Cos. (WMB) , a U.S. operator of
gas and oil pipelines, was sued by three pipefitters injured in
the June 13 explosion at a subsidiary’s chemical plant in
Geismar, Louisiana.  The three men were fixing leaky pipes that had failed
federal safety inspections, according to  Brent Coon , the
workers’ attorney. The plaintiffs accuse Williams of negligence
for not properly maintaining its equipment and pipelines. The
blast in the plant’s propylene fractionation unit killed two and
injured 77, the company said.  Williams “failed to train and provide plaintiffs with
safety, emergency and/or escape procedures,” Coon said in a
complaint filed June 21 after regular business hours in state
court in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The three workers were
among dozens trapped inside the plant after the explosion until
a co-worker smashed through a locked gate in a company truck to
allow them to escape, according to the filing.  The workers seek unspecified damages for their injuries,
including back injuries alleged by one worker who was blown off
scaffolding.  Sara Delgado, a spokeswoman for Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
Williams, declined to comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Rios v. Williams Entergy Partners, 107,298C,
23rd Judicial District Court, Ascension Parish,  Louisiana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
