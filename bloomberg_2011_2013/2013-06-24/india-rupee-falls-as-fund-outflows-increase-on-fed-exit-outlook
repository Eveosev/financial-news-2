India ’s rupee fell, extending a
seven-week slide, after global investors boosted sales of local
bonds and stocks on the prospect of the U.S. paring stimulus
policies that have boosted dollar supply.  Foreign funds pulled $4.6 billion from Indian  debt  and
 shares  in June, exchange data show. The nation’s current-account
deficit widened to a record of around 5 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31, the government
estimates. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against
the currencies of six trade partners, rose for a fourth day
after the Federal Reserve signaled on June 19 it may taper its
bond-buying program this year and end it in 2014.  “Fund flows are going to be volatile given the outlook for
the Fed phasing out its stimulus measures,” said Vikas Babu, a
trader at state-run  Andhra Bank (ANDB)  in Mumbai. “So, from the
current-account view, the rupee is a bit more vulnerable. Only
intervention can curb the rupee’s slide.”  The rupee slid 0.6 percent to 59.645 per dollar as of 10:29
a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched a record low of 59.98 on June 20. The currency declined
5.3 percent this month, Asia’s worst performance. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, was steady at 12.54 percent.  India is prepared to curb currency volatility, Raghuram Rajan, chief economic adviser at the finance ministry, said in
New Delhi on June 20. The dollar’s 14-day relative-strength
index against the rupee was at 75.2, above the 70 threshold that
signals the greenback’s rally is poised to end.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards dropped 0.7 percent from
June 21 to 60.60 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts fell 0.1 percent
to 60.77. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set
price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
