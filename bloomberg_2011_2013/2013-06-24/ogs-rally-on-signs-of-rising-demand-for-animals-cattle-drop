Hog futures climbed on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. animals. Cattle prices fell.  Wholesale  pork , known in the industry as the cutout, added
3.5 percent last week, the third straight weekly gain, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. About 46.45 million hogs
have been commercially slaughtered in the five months through
May 31, up 0.5 percent from the same period in 2012, the USDA
said in a  report  on June 20. Spot-hog  prices  are up 8.2 percent
this month through June 21.  “The big factors are cash and cutout are still rolling
right along, still strong,” Lou Arens, a broker at PCI Advisory
Services in Waucoma,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “As
long as this cutout keeps going, the packers can still afford to
keep buying and pushing the prices higher.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.8 percent to 98.2
cents a pound at 10:34 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.
The August contract climbed 1 percent in 2013 through June 21.  Cattle futures for August delivery slipped 0.2 percent to
$1.213 a pound on the CME. The contract was down 6.6 percent
this year through June 21.  Feedlots sold 1.948 million head of cattle to meatpackers
last month, down 3.4 percent from a year earlier and the second-fewest transactions for the month of May since the data series
began in 1996, the USDA said in a report after the close of
regular trading on June 21. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had
projected a 1.9 percent slide, on average.  “The marketings were not as good as expected,”  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We moved fewer
cattle into the slaughter chain.”  Wholesale  beef  fell 0.1 percent last week, the fifth
straight decline, government data show. That’s the longest slide
since February.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.6
percent to $1.4775 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
