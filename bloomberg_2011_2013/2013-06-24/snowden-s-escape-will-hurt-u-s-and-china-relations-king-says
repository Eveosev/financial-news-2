Hong Kong’s decision to let Edward
Snowden leave despite a U.S. warrant for his arrest will hurt
relations between U.S. and China, Representative  Peter King , a
 New York  Republican who serves on both the House Intelligence
and Homeland Security committees, said in an interview on
Bloomberg TV today.  “Hong Kong wouldn’t have allowed him to leave Hong Kong
without sign-off from the Chinese government,” King said.  “To allow him out of the country one or two days after
extradition papers were served is not good faith, and for some
reasons Hong Kong and China wanted to let Snowden get away and
this is a direct slap at the U.S.,” King said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
