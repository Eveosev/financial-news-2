An American businessman who says his
employees haven’t let him leave his factory on the outskirts of
Beijing over a pay dispute is safe and may be allowed to go
soon, the U.S. Embassy said.  Embassy officials met with Charles Starnes today and
confirmed he “might be close to reaching an agreement,”
Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said by phone today. Starnes
will be able to meet with his attorneys, Barkhouse said.  Starnes works for Coral Gables, Florida-based Specialty
Medical Supplies, a manufacturer of alcohol prep pads and
lancing devices. In a phone interview yesterday, he said he
hadn’t been allowed to leave the factory since June 21 over a
wage dispute that began after the company decided to move some
plastics production to  India  and pay severance to 30 staff.  Other employees who were to remain at the factory producing
alcohol prep pads learned about the decision and decided to quit
and demanded the severance pay, Starnes said. When the company
refused, they wouldn’t to let him remove some equipment. The
dispute then drew in other employees who surrounded the factory
and blocked him from leaving.  “They said ‘Alright, if you don’t want to pay, we’re going
to sit on your equipment, we’re not going to let you load your
stuff,’” Starnes said. ‘They completely impeded and stopped
us.’’  Starnes didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
