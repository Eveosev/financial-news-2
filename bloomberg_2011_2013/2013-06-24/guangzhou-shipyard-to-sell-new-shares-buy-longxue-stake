Guangzhou Shipyard International
Co. (317) , a unit of the nation’s biggest shipbuilder, plans to sell
as much as 2.5 billion  yuan  ($407 million) of new shares to its
parent and other investors, in part to finance an acquisition.  The company will use as much as 1 billion yuan from the
placement to buy CSSC Guangzhou Longxue Shipbuilding Co. from
controlling shareholder  China  State Shipbuilding Corp. and its
partners, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing
yesterday evening. Guangzhou Shipyard said it will use the
balance of the proceeds for working capital.  Longxue is the largest builder of “modern” large ore,
bulk and oil vessels in southern China, with annual capacity of
3.5 million deadweight tons, Guangzhou Shipyard said. The Baltic
Dry Index, a gauge of costs to transport minerals and grains by
sea, had its biggest advance since October last week.  China State will buy at least 2 billion yuan of Guangzhou
shipyard’s new shares, according to yesterday’s filing. The
company’s shares will resume trading in Hong Kong today, ending
a suspension that started on May 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
