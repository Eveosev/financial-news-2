     June 24 (Bloomberg) -- China Fishery Group Ltd., a unit of
 Pacific Andes Resources Development Ltd. (PAH)  increased its offer for
 Copeinca ASA (COP) , a producer of fishmeal and oil from Peruvian
anchovies, to about 4.8 billion kroner ($790 million).  China Fishery, through its Grand Success Investment unit,
will offer 68.17 kroner a share, Lima-based Copeinca said in a
statement today. That compares with an earlier bid of 59.70
kroner. The Hong Kong-based company has pre-acceptances for
about 57 percent of Copeinca, meaning it now controls 74.2
percent of the group, Copeinca said.  China Fishery is seeking to buy Copeinca to expand into the
South American nation, the worldâ€™s largest exporter of salmon
feed ingredients by volume, as the global aquaculture industry
grows and livestock production increases.  Cermaq ASA (CEQ) , a Norwegian fish-feed maker which had also been
bidding for Copeinca, will accept the new offer from China
Fishery, it said in a separate statement.  Shares in Copeinca jumped 16 percent to 67.5 kroner, the
highest intraday level since Oct. 8, 2007, and where they were
trading as of 9:18 a.m. Cermaq gained 1.5 percent to 104 kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
