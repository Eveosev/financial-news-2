CCR SA (CCRO3) , which manages highways
including the main route connecting  Sao Paulo  and  Rio de
Janeiro , plunged after Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin
scrapped a toll increase amid nationwide protests.  The shares fell 3 percent to 16.31 reais at 12:33 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, set for the lowest closing level since July 2012.
Ecorodovias Infraestrutura & Logistica SA, Brazilâ€™s largest
toll-road operator, dropped 3.2 percent to 14.42 reais.  Arteris
SA (ARTR3)  declined 4.8 percent to 17.90 reais. The Ibovespa benchmark
gauge plunged 3.1 percent.  The state suspended the toll increase of as much as 6.5
percent that was set to take effect July 1, Alckmin told
reporters in Sao Paulo today. The state had already canceled
fare increases for buses, trains and subways that sparked the
biggest street protests in almost two decades.  The state will suspend fines for delays in construction and
fees it charges from the companies to offset the scrapped
increases in fares, according to Alckmin. The total cost for the
government will be 400 million reais ($178 million) in 2013,
according to Transportation Secretary Saulo de Castro Abreu
Filho.  To contact the reporters on this story:
