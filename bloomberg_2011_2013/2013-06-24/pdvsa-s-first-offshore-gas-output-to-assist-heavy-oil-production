Initial natural gas volumes from
offshore  Venezuela  will likely assist in the production of heavy
crude oil rather than be used for exports.  Output from the offshore La Perla field is expected to
reach 300 million cubic feet a day by the end of 2013 when it
begins production, according to the website of Venezuela’s state
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.  South America ’s
largest oil  producer  plans to invest $22 billion from 2013 to
2019 to develop gas projects.  “Initial gas production offshore Venezuela will likely be
used to increase the production of heavy crudes,” Rebecca Fitz,
an analyst with Washington-based PFC Energy, said in a phone
interview Friday.  PDVSA, based in Caracas, produced 7.3 billion cubic feet a
day of gas in 2012 from onshore fields, of which 2.9 billion
cubic feet a day was reinjected into reservoirs to assist in the
production of heavy and extra-heavy crudes. The rest was used
above ground domestically. PDVSA expects to produce 11.9 billion
cubic feet a day of gas by the end of 2019.  Repsol SA and Eni SpA are partners in the La Perla field,
each with a 32.5 percent  stake .  To contact the reporter on this story:
