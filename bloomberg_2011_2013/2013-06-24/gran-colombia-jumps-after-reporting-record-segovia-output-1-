Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (GCM) , a Canadian
miner producing the precious metal in the Andean nation, rallied
after saying average output rose to a record at its Segovia
operations.  Gran Colombia soared 9 percent to C$2.39 at the close in
Toronto.  Daily gold production at Segovia in April and May rose 11
percent from the first quarter to 235 ounces a day, Gran
Colombia said today in a statement.  “In May, we achieved the highest monthly production in the
company’s history at our Segovia operations,” Serafino Iacono,
Executive Co-Chairman of Gran Colombia, said in the statement.  Last week gold prices in New York slumped below $1,300 an
ounce for the first time since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
