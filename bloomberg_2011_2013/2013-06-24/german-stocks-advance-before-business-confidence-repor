German stocks  advanced before a
report that may show business confidence in Europe’s biggest
economy increased in June.  Kabel Deutschland Holding AG (KD8)  gained 2 percent after
Vodafone Group Plc agreed to buy the cable operator for 7.7
billion euros ($10.1 billion).  Metro AG (MEO)  lost 2.4 percent after
Citigroup Inc. downgraded the shares.  The  DAX (DAX)  added 0.2 percent to 7,807.71 at 9:20 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The equity benchmark retreated 4.2 percent last week
as investors prepared for a potential paring of stimulus later
this year by the  Federal Reserve . The broader HDAX Index gained
0.1 percent today.  German business confidence probably increased in June amid
signs that a recovery in Europe’s largest economy is gathering
pace. The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, will rise to 105.9 from 105.7 in
May, according to the median of 46 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Ifo releases the report at 10 a.m. in Munich today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its estimate for Chinese
economic growth in 2013 to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent, citing
weaker economic indicators and tighter financial conditions.  Kabel Deutschland , Germany’s biggest cable operator, added
2 percent to 85.75 euros. Kabel Deutschland’s board is set to
recommend Vodafone’s 87-euro per share cash offer, Newbury,
England-based Vodafone said in a statement today.  Metro, Germany’s largest retailer, lost 2.4 percent to
24.30 euros. Citigroup downgraded the shares to sell from
neutral, citing weakening growth in Russia -- which the bank
said accounted for a quarter of Metro’s operating cash flow last
year -- and the declining rouble.  To contact the reporter on this story:
