The won fell to a one-year low on
concern a tapering of the  Federal Reserve ’s stimulus will reduce
demand for emerging-market assets. Government bonds declined.  South Korean authorities will monitor markets and take
steps to deal with the impact of the unwinding of U.S. policies,
Yonhap News reported, citing comments by Finance Minister Hyun
Oh Seok at a meeting with lawmakers today. The  Dollar Index ,
which tracks the greenback against the currencies of six trade
partners, rose 2.5 percent since June 18, the day before Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled the central bank may reduce
its bond-buying program this year and end it in 2014.  “The dollar remains strong globally since Bernanke’s
comments last week,” said  Park Hyun , a currency trader at Woori
Bank Co. in Seoul. “The authorities’ comment to support the won
was not strong enough to offset the globally strong dollar
trend.”  The won fell 0.6 percent to 1,161.23 per dollar in Seoul,
the weakest level since June 26, 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a gauge of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
for a sixth day, increasing by 32 basis points, or 0.32
percentage point, to 13.06 percent.  Overseas investors sold more South Korean shares than they
bought for a 12th day today, adding to $4.5 billion of net sales
this month through June 21, exchange data show.  Tighter Monitoring  The current volatility is likely to affect bond markets and
corporate funding, Financial Services Commission Chairman Shin
Je Yoon said at a meeting today, according to an e-mailed
statement. The government plans to tighten monitoring of banks’
liquidity and scale down its debt sales volumes in July, Vice
Finance Minister Choo Kyung Ho said on June 23 in Seoul.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 700 billion won ($603 million) of
20-year sovereign notes with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.116 times,
Kim Suk, assistant director at the Finance Ministry’s treasury
bureau, said by phone today.  The yield on the 2.75 percent  government bonds  due March
2018 rose 16 basis points to 3.42 percent, the highest level for
a benchmark five-year note since June 29, 2012, prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
