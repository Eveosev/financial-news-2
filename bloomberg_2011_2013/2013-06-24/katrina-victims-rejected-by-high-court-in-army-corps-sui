The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal from Hurricane Katrina victims seeking billions of
dollars on claims that the  Army Corps  of Engineers added to the
storm’s impact by improperly maintaining a shipping channel.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said the Federal Tort Claims Act shields the U.S.
government from lawsuits. The lower-court ruling came in test
cases designed to resolve many of the hundreds of Katrina-related suits against the federal government.  Units of  Entergy Corp. (ETR) , a New Orleans-based energy company,
were among those urging a  high-court  review. Entergy says it
sustained $1.3 billion in damage from the 2005 hurricane.  A federal trial judge found “monumental negligence” by
the Army Corps in allowing erosion to widen the channel to three
times its design width over the course of decades. The judge
said the widened channel exacerbated the effect of the Katrina
storm surge, helping cause the breach of a levee and the
flooding of New Orleans’s Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard
Parish.  The case is Lattimore v. United States, 12-1092.  To contact the reporter on this story:
