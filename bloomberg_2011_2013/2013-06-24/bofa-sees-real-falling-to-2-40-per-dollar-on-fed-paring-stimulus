Brazil’s exchange rate may weaken to
2.40 reais per  U.S. dollar  in one to two years after the Federal
Reserve signaled it may pare back monetary stimulus, said  David Beker , the chief Brazil economist at Bank of America Merrill
Lynch.  “The tendency for the next quarters and maybe years is for
dollar appreciation and more depreciation pressure for emerging
markets,” he said in an interview at his office in Sao Paulo
today. The bank forecasts a rate of 2.20 reais per U.S. dollar
at the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
