Inchcape Plc (INCH) , the largest publicly
traded U.K. car retailer and wholesaler, had its biggest three-day drop in almost two years after Russian auto sales declined.  The  shares  slumped 3.6 percent to 458.6 pence at the close
in London today, extending the three-day fall to 14 percent, the
largest in as many days since August 2011.  Inchcape plummeted 7.4 percent on June 21 after Redburn
Partners cut its  rating  to neutral from buy. The stock has seven
buy and six hold recommendations among analysts tracked by
Bloomberg, and hasn’t had a sell rating since September 2011.
Redburn declined to make its report available to Bloomberg.  New car sales in  Russia   plunged 12 percent  in May from a
year earlier, the biggest year-on-year drop since February 2010,
according to the Association of European Businesses. The group’s
Automobile Manufacturers Committee lowered its forecast for
full-year sales to 2.8 million vehicles, or 5 percent less than
in 2012.  Russia and other  emerging markets  accounted for 1.26
billion pounds ($1.94 billion), or 21 percent of Inchcape’s
revenue of 6.09 billion pounds last year, according to the
London-based  company . Operating profit in Russia and emerging
markets fell 35 percent to 34.9 million pounds, or 13 percent of
total operating profit.  The 21 percent drop in Inchcape’s share price since
reaching the highest in almost five years on May 21 has pared
its gain this year to about 6.4 percent, trailing competitors
such as  HR Owen Plc (HRO) , up 77 percent, and  Pendragon Plc (PDG) , which has
risen 36 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
