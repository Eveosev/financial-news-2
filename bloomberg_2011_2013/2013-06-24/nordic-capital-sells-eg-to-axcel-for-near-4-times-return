Nordic Capital  will reap four times
its investment from the sale of Danish information-technology
company  EG A/S (EGEB)  to Axcel A/S, another private-equity firm, said a
person with knowledge of the investment.  The Swedish investor today agreed to sell the Copenhagen-based software and services provider for about 1.19 billion
Danish krone ($209 million), said the person, who asked not to
be identified because the transaction hasn’t been made public.
That’s about four times more than its original investment in
July 2008, the person added.  “The company has significantly strengthened its market
position and is well-placed to continue to develop and grow
under the new ownership,” Lars Terney, chairman of EG and
partner at Nordic Capital, said in a statement, which didn’t
disclose terms of the transaction.  The firm, which specializes in Scandinavian and German-speaking countries, is seeking to return cash to investors as it
asks for as much as six more months to complete its latest
fundraising. The firm, which is seeking 3 billion euros ($3.9
billion) euros, held a 1.7-billion euro first close in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
