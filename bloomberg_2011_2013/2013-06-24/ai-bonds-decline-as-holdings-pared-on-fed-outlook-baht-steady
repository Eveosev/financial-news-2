Thailand ’s bonds fell, sending the
benchmark 10-year yield toward the highest level since September
2011, as overseas investors cut holdings amid prospects the
 Federal Reserve  will taper monetary stimulus.  Bank of Thailand Deputy Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said
June 20 that fund outflows from developing nations will continue
after the Fed’s clear statement on quantitative easing. The
Asian nation’s central bank will step in to curve excessive
volatility in the baht if needed, she said, as the currency
traded 0.4 percent off a nine-month low reached June 21.  Yields have been rising due to the “impact from the
speculation about the Fed,” said Pareena Phuangsiri, a Bangkok-based analyst at Kasikornbank Pcl. “But sell-offs seem to be
overdone in terms of the currency and bonds. Speculation is
growing about intervention.”  The rate on the 3.625 percent government notes due June
2023 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.98
percent as of 9:36 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It touched 4.01 percent on June 12, the highest
since September 2011.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 that $85 billion
a month of debt purchases may be trimmed this year and ended in
2014 as long as the  U.S. economy  performs in line with the
authority’s projections. Global funds sold $473 million more
Thai bonds than they bought this month through June 21 and
pulled a net $1.5 billion from equities, official data show.  Exports Data  Thailand’s foreign  reserves (THFRUS$)  will help minimize the impact
from the Fed, Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said June 20.
He said he wants the central bank to “manage the foreign-exchange rate” to curb volatility. Reserves stood at $176.5
billion as of June 14, up 1.4 percent from a year ago, central
bank data show.  The baht was little changed today at 31.13 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency reached 31.25 on June
21, the weakest level since Sept. 7. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, dropped 26 basis points to 7.58 percent.  Thailand reports exports data this week. The Customs
Department may say June 26 that shipments contracted 4 percent
last month, after growing 2.9 percent in April, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Central
bank figures are due June 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
