The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an
appeal by Joseph Apuzzo, the former chief financial officer of
 Terex Corp. (TEX) , letting the Securities and Exchange Commission
press ahead with claims that he aided an accounting fraud.  The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said the SEC had adequately alleged that Apuzzo
provided substantial assistance to the scheme.  The SEC claims Apuzzo helped  United Rentals Inc. (URI) , an
equipment-leasing company, carry out two fraudulent sale and
leaseback transactions in 2000 and 2001.  Terex, an equipment-manufacturing company, is based in
Westport,  Connecticut . United Rentals is based in Greenwich,
Connecticut.  The case is Apuzzo v. Securities and Exchange Commission,
12-1118.  To contact the reporter on this story:
