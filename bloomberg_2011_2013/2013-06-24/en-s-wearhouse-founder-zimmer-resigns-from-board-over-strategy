Men’s Wearhouse Inc. (MW)  founder George Zimmer resigned from the company’s board of directors effective
immediately, citing concerns with the retailer’s strategic
direction.  Zimmer, who started Men’s Wearhouse 40 years ago, was fired
June 19 as executive chairman. In a letter of resignation
submitted to the board today, Zimmer says his termination shows
the directors’ unwillingness to address his “growing concerns
with recent board decisions and the strategic direction of the
company.”  The executive’s termination followed repeated clashes over
strategy between Zimmer, 64, and Douglas Ewert, his hand-picked
chief executive officer, according to a person familiar with the
matter. The conflict centered in part on plans to sell K&G, a
retailer of men’s, women’s and children’s apparel, and to buy
back shares, said the person, who asked not to be named because
the matter is private.  Men’s Wearhouse  fell  1.8 percent to $35.13 at the close of
 New York  trading. The shares have risen 13 percent this year,
compared with a 10 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index. (SPX)   Zimmer was the Houston-based company’s seventh-largest
 shareholder  as of April 3, with about 1.77 million shares, or
3.5 percent of the stock outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
