The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission is reviewing complaints of bogus bids and offers in
the West Texas Intermediate crude-oil market, a practice known
as “spoofing,” according to Bart Chilton, a commissioner.  “I asked the staff to tell me if there’s been spoofing in
the oil market over the past few days,” Chilton said today
during an interview in  Chicago , after receiving more than half a
dozen complaints from traders.  “Spoofing,” which is illegal, involves bids or offers
that are entered with the intent of canceling them before the
trade is carried out. WTI, traded on CME Group Inc.’s  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, is the world’s biggest energy-futures
contract.  “Individuals, traders, they contend it is occurring,”
Chilton said. “They contend they have tried to hit some prices,
and they could not get them.”  Crude-oil futures for August delivery plunged 4.9 percent
in the two days ended June 21, dropping to a two-week low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
