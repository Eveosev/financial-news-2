London  Mayor Boris Johnson said the
capital will benefit from investment in infrastructure projects
when the U.K. Treasury announces plans this week for 50 billion
pounds ($77 billion) of capital spending in 2015-16.  “I think the Treasury really get the point; if you invest
in London and in the infrastructure, you turn the wheels of the
rest of the economy and I think you are going to see a bit of
that,” Johnson said in an interview with Bloomberg Television
in London today.  Johnson said on June 11 that Prime Minister David Cameron’s
government should invest in London as the “supercharged motor”
of the U.K.’s recovery, putting spending into infrastructure
projects such as a new hub airport, with further housing needed
to keep the capital “firing on all cylinders.”  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander will set
out the government’s capital-spending plans on June 27, a day
after Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne gives details
of his deals with his fellow ministers to cut 11.5 billion
pounds from their budgets for the year beginning April 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
