U.S. stocks and Treasuries pared
losses after the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index slipped to a nine-week low and yields on benchmark 10-year notes reached the
highest levels since August 2011.  The  S&P 500  slid 0.7 percent to 1,580.37 at 2:13 p.m. in
New York, after tumbling as much as 2 percent earlier. Ten-year
Treasury note yields fell one basis point to 2.53 percent.  Stocks and bonds fell earlier as Chinese equities entered a
bear market on concern a cash crunch will hurt the economy and
amid mounting speculation the U.S. will begin curbing stimulus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
