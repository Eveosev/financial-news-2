BreitBurn Energy Partners LP (BBEP) , the
Los Angeles-based oil and natural gas partnership, fell after
announcing the purchase of $890.2 million of assets in  Oklahoma 
to be funded with debt.  BreitBurn declined 3.1 percent to $17.36 at the close in
New York.  Wells to be acquired in the Oklahoma Panhandle produce the
equivalent of 7,400 barrels of oil a day, the partnership said
today in a statement. The partnership will pay about $860
million to  Whiting Petroleum Corp. (WLL) , based in Denver, and $30.2
million to other owners, according to the statement. Bank
borrowings will fund the purchases.  The transaction, expected to close July 31, will increase
cash available to pay unit holders, supporting BreitBurn’s
target to boost the payout by 5 percent a year, according to the
statement.  Oil from the fields will sell for $8 a barrel less than the
U.S. benchmark and lifting costs, a measure of production
expense, will be $18 a barrel, according to the statement.  The agreement includes a 60 percent stake in a pipeline
carrying carbon dioxide that’s used to coax oil from the Postle
and Northeast Hardest fields, Whiting said in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
