U.K. stocks declined, led by selloff
in mining companies.  Vedanta Resources Plc dropped 4.7 percent as copper sank to
a 20-month low. Rio Tinto Group Plc and Antofagasta Plc both
lost at least 1.9 percent.  The FTSE 100 Index slid 34.27 points, or 0.6 percent, to
6,081.9 at 9:31 a.m. in  London . The gauge fell 3.1 percent last
week, extending its selloff since May 22 to more than 10
percent, after the  Federal Reserve  indicated that it may start
paring stimulus measures as soon as September.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
