Richard Fisher , president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said investors shouldn’t
overreact to the central bank’s plans to reduce the pace of
asset purchases.  Fisher, in an interview with the Financial Times published on
its web site today, said investors behaved like “feral hogs”
after the June 19 comments by Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.
Fisher isn’t a voting member of the Federal Open Market
Committee this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
