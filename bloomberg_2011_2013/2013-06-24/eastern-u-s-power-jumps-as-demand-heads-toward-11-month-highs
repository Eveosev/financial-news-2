Spot wholesale power on three
Eastern U.S. grids gained as summer heat and humidity drove
demand to the highest level in more than 11 months.  The Northeast and mid-Atlantic states will see above-normal
temperatures through the end of the week, according to WSI Corp.
in Andover, Massachusetts. The high in  Boston  today will be 94
degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 15 degrees higher than usual,
and Washington may be 4 degrees above normal at 91, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “It’s hot out there,” said  Stephen Schork , president of
Schork Group Inc., a consulting group in Villanova,
Pennsylvania. “We are looking at the low mid-90s all week and
decent humidity, so it makes sense that we are going to see load
increase. That should be supportive to prices.”  Spot electricity for New York City climbed $13.92, or 34
percent, to $54.76 a megawatt-hour from the same time on June
21, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The day-ahead price
for the hour was $56.70. The  on-peak average  was up 19 percent
at $51.61 from the June 21 full-day average.  Boston jumped $10.80, or 23 percent, to average $58.42 a
megawatt-hour during the same hour, higher than the day-ahead
outlook of $54.74. The  on-peak average  is up 20 percent at
$57.51.  Power for PJM Interconnection LLC’s  Eastern hub , which
includes prices from  New Jersey  to  Virginia , rose $6.12, or 12
percent, to $57.76 a megawatt-hour, above the day-ahead outlook
of $53.04. The  on-peak average  is up 3.2 percent at $42.26.  Heat Alert  PJM expects  demand  on its 13-state grid, the largest in the
U.S., to peak at 142,961 megawatts during the hour ended at 5
p.m., the most since Aug. 3. The  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based grid manager issued a  Hot Weather Alert  for tomorrow on
the possibility that extreme heat and humidity may cause
capacity constraints.  The New York Independent System Operator Inc. said peak
demand in  Manhattan  and the neighboring four boroughs will reach
10,279 megawatts today, also the highest since Aug. 3.  Electricity consumption  on the six-state grid from Maine to
Connecticut will peak at 25,000 megawatts, the most since July
18, according to ISO New England Inc. data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
