India ’s government bonds fell,
pushing the yield on the 2022 notes to a six-week high, on
speculation the rupee’s plunge to a record low reduces the
chance the central bank will cut borrowing costs.  The Indian currency posted its biggest loss since September
2011 last week and touched an unprecedented 59.98 per dollar on
June 20 as the U.S. signaled it is prepared to phase out a
stimulus program that spurred fund flows to  emerging markets . A
weaker rupee raises the cost of imports including oil. The
 Reserve Bank  of India held its repurchase rate at 7.25 percent
on June 17, after cutting in the previous three reviews, citing
inflation risks.  “The sharp fall in the rupee will exert pressure on
inflation and is also likely to deteriorate the already high
current-account deficit,” said Prasanna Patankar, the Mumbai-based head of treasury at Securities Trading Corp. of India Ltd.
“The RBI maintained in its policy review that it is only a
durable receding of inflation that will open up the space for
monetary policy.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.65 percent as
of 9:53 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That’s the highest level since May 8.  The monetary-policy stance will be determined by the
evolution of economic growth, inflation and the balance of
payments in the months ahead, the central bank said in its
statement on June 17, adding it stands ready to “respond
rapidly and appropriately to any adverse developments.”  The rupee weakened further today, dropping 0.7 percent to
59.6675 per dollar, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The one-year interest-rate swap, a
derivative contract used to guard against fluctuations in
funding costs, jumped five basis points to 7.48 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
