IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE)  won
European Union approval to take over  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  after EU
regulators said the deal wouldn’t harm competition.  The deal was cleared today by the European Commission,
which checks for antitrust issues with transactions in the 27-nation EU, according to an e-mailed statement.  “The commission’s investigation confirmed that the
proposed transaction would not raise competition concerns as NYX
and ICE are not direct competitors in the markets concerned and
would continue to face competition from a number of other
competitors,” the EU regulator said.  ICE, the energy and commodity futures bourse, agreed on
Dec. 21 to acquire NYSE Euronext for cash and stock totaling
$8.2 billion at the time. Shareholders of both companies
approved the transaction on June 3. The deal means ICE is a step
closer to gaining control of Liffe,  Europe ’s second-largest
derivatives market. EU regulators blocked  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s
purchase of NYSE last year, citing concern over competition in
derivatives and clearing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
