Hong Kong  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index headed for its longest losing streak in two

system and reduced U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus.  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) , the nation’s No. 3 lender,

clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 0.8
percent. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil company,
retreated 2.5 percent on lower crude prices.  Belle International
Holdings Ltd. (1880) , the nation’s largest footwear retailer, sank 6.1
percent after BNP Paribas SA cut its target price.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 1.6 percent to 19,937.66 as of
10 a.m. in Hong Kong. All but seven stocks declined in the 50-member gauge, which is heading for its lowest close since Sept.
11. Trading volume was 25 percent more than its 30-day intraday
average. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland
companies slid 2.6 percent to 8,995.57.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index  declined 1.7 percent to
19,859. The HSI Volatility Index climbed 11 percent to 25.6, the
highest in a year, indicating traders expect a swing of 7.3
percent for the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
