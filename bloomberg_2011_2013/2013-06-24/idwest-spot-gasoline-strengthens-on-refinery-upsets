U.S. Midwest gasoline strengthened
as regional refineries reported power failures, threatening to
tighten supplies that have increased four straight weeks.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in Chicago
gained  6.5 cents  to 15 cents a gallon below futures on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:35 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The discount shrank for a third day after
reaching the widest level since March 1.  The discount for  87-octane gasoline  in Group 3 narrowed 1
cent to 9 cents a gallon under futures, the  first advance  in 11
days. Group 3 includes states north of Oklahoma to Minnesota and
 North Dakota .  Regional discounts slimmed after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reported
an equipment failure at its 238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet,
 Illinois , refinery and as Flint Hills Resources LLC restarted
units following a June 21 power outage.  Spreads may also be falling because the market found a
“little bottom,” following recent declines, according to Steve Mosby, partner at ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas
City , Missouri.  Chicago gasoline has fallen 80 cents this month, compared
with a 12.5-cent decline in Group 3, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Shortages Ease  The differentials tumbled after gasoline shortages were
eased as Exxon returned units to service after a plantwide
turnaround in Illinois.  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  also
lifted several terminals from allocation program that was put in
place May 16 due to higher demand amid low supply.  Stockpiles of gasoline  in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
climbed 507,000 barrels to 49.7 million barrels in the week
ended June 14, a fourth consecutive weekly gain, according to
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, slid 12 cents to $17.01 a barrel. The same
spread dropped $1.85 to $19.03 a barrel in the Group 3 region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
