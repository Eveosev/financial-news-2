JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , China’s
biggest solar-cell maker, expects deliveries in the second
quarter to exceed an earlier forecast on higher demand from the
U.S. and Japan.  Shipments will exceed 430 megawatts in the three months
ending June 30, Bill Chen, vice president of strategic
development, said in an interview. The Shanghai-based company
last month estimated deliveries of 410 megawatts to 430
megawatts of solar modules and cells in the period.  An oversupply and tumbling prices led JA Solar and other
solar-component makers to report losses last year and saw
 Suntech Power Holdings (STP)  Co.’s main unit enter into bankruptcy
proceedings in March. Industry restructuring may last another
year and the company is expected to return to profitability in
early 2014, Chen said.  The company “has seen the market recovering since the end
of last year, as some competitors fell into debt crisis and
demand from the U.S. and  Japan  is stronger than expected,” he
said in  Shanghai  on June 21. “Module prices bottomed out and
are stabilizing.”  Installations in the U.S. and Japan are forecast to rise 67
percent to 10 gigawatts this year and equal installations in
 Europe , he said.  The company plans to raise $80 million by selling shares
within two years, Chen said. JA Solar has registered the
offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and
“will choose a proper time to sell,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
