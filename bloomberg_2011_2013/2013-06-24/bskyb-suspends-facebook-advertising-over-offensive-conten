British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ,
the U.K.’s largest pay-TV broadcaster, has suspended its
advertising on Facebook, after one of its ads was displayed
adjacent to offensive material.  “Such content is clearly unacceptable to Sky and our
customers,” Isleworth, England-based BSkyB said by e-mail
today. “We have asked Facebook to devise safeguards to ensure
our content does not appear alongside inappropriate material in
the future.”  The suspension comes after Nissan Motor Co.’s U.K. unit and
lender  Nationwide Building Society  last month halted some
Facebook ads that could have appeared next to offensive content.  In a  blog post  last month,  Menlo Park , California-based
Facebook said it would increase the accountability of the
creators of content, and it would work with legal experts, to
ensure its employees are adequately trained to evaluate hateful
or harmful content.  Facebook (FB)  had $1.25 billion in advertising
revenue in the first quarter of 2013, about 85 percent of its
total sales.  BSkyB “will review the situation in due course,”
according to the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
