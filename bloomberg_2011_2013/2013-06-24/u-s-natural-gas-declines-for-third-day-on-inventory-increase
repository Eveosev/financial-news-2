Natural gas futures declined for a
third day in  New York  as unusually hot weather this week is
forecast to moderate, cutting demand from  power plants .  Gas fell 0.8 percent as above-normal temperatures expected
across the U.S. this week will give way to milder weather in the
East next week, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . Gas stockpile increases topped five-year
averages for three straight weeks, based on the most recent
government reports.  “The problem is that while the near-term pattern of heat
unfolding this week should support prices, the weather appears
to be falling apart next week,” said Teri Viswanath, director
of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “In
order for a summertime rally to take hold, the injections will
need to better align with the five-year average.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 3.2 cents to settle at
$3.739 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 34 percent below the
100-day average for the time of day. Prices have climbed 12
percent this year.  The discount of July to October futures was unchanged at
3.3 cents.  July $3.90 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading. They were 0.3 cent lower at 0.1 cent per million Btu on
volume of 1,071 at 2:29 p.m. Calls accounted for 48 percent of
trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in August was 30.2 percent at 2:15 p.m., compared with
29.75 percent on June 21.  New York  The high temperature in New York on June 26 may be 92
degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius), 10 above normal, before
dropping to 10 degrees lower than the usual reading at 73
degrees on July 2, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania .  Temperatures in  Dallas  will reach 103 degrees on June 28, 9
above normal, before dropping to the low 80s next week,
AccuWeather said.  Power plants, the biggest consumers of U.S. gas, will
account for 32 percent of demand in 2013, according to the
Energy Information Administration, a unit of the Energy
Department in  Washington .  “The cooling demand and the eager cadre of investors who
see natural gas as a screaming buy are helping to give prices
support,”  John Kilduff , partner at Again Capital LLC and editor
of the Energy OverView newsletter in New York, wrote today.
“The rising inventories should prevail in working off the
enthusiasm for a rally.”  Pivot Point  The $3.80 price level has been a pivot point for gas
futures before and “it looks like it is emerging as one
again,” he said.  U.S. inventories rose by 91 billion cubic feet to 2.438
trillion in the week ended June 14, above the five-year average
gain for the period of 80 billion, according to the EIA. A
 deficit  to the average narrowed to 1.9 percent from 2.4 percent
the previous week. Supplies were 18.7 percent below  year-earlier
levels , the narrowest since March 8.  Hedge funds  reduced bullish bets on U.S. natural gas
contracts to a three month low, according to the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s June 21 Commitments of Traders
report.  Net-long positions  declined by 25,248 futures
equivalents, or 6.9 percent, to 340,489 in the week ended June
