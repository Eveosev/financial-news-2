French Open champion Rafael Nadal
lost the first two sets of his opening-round match at Wimbledon
with 113th-ranked Steve Darcis of  Belgium .  Darcis, 29, is leading the Spaniard 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (10-8).
Nadal, 27, is the only men’s player to have achieved the No. 1
ranking who has never lost an opening round match at a Grand
Slam event. He’s played in major tennis tournaments 35 times.  The Belgian has won just 2 of his seven matches this year.
Nadal is trying to become the second man, after Bjorn Borg, to
win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year three times
since tennis went professional.  Nadal, who has 12 major tennis titles, lost in the second
round last year to Lukas Rosol of the Czech Republic. The
Spaniard has lost just two of his 45 matches so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
