Modern Times Group AB (MTGB)  fell the most
in eight months in Stockholm trading after  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  said
margins at the company’s Pay TV operations will continue to be
burdened and downgraded its rating on the stock.  MTG lost  as much as 12.5 kronor, or 4.6 percent, to 261
kronor, its steepest intraday drop since Oct. 18. It traded 2.1
percent lower at 267.7 kronor at 9:36 a.m. local time, giving
MTG a market value of 18.3 billion kronor ($2.7 billion).  Nordea cut its rating on MTG shares to hold from buy with a
price estimate of 300 kronor “after a 21 percent share uptick”
this year, according to a note to clients from analyst Johan Grabe today. It also reduced its earnings per share estimates in
2013 to 2015 by 2 percent to 3 percent.  “We expect MTG to post stable progress for its Nordic Free
TV business, while the second-quarter Pay TV margins will remain
burdened at around 11 percent due to cost hikes,” Grabe said.
“We expect continued margin pressure debate to hold back the
valuation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
