Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISIS)  climbed
the most in more than five years on data showing the company’s
experimental drug helped bring down diabetes patients’
triglyceride levels, an important measure of heart health.  Isis, based in Carlsbad,  California , rose 20 percent to
$26.43 at 12:42 p.m., after increasing as much as 24 percent in
the largest intraday advance since Jan. 8, 2008.  Type 2 diabetes patients with high triglyceride levels saw
a 72 percent reduction of the blood fat and a 40 percent
increase in high-density lipoprotein, or HDL, the good type of
cholesterol, according to a study. The data, from the second of
three phases of clinical trials generally needed for regulatory
approval, were presented yesterday at the American Diabetes
Association meeting in  Chicago , Isis said in a statement.  “Patients with high levels of triglycerides are at a
significant risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke,” Joseph Witztum, professor of medicine at the  University of California ,
 San Diego , said in the statement.  The study examined 11 patients over 13 weeks who either
took the drug ISIS-APOCIII in a 300 milligram injection or a
placebo. Two-to-one of the 11 were given the treatment, the
company said in the statement.  The drug also showed a trend toward improvements in blood
sugar control.  Isis’s focus is to bring the medication to market for
patients who can’t reduce their triglyceride levels to a safe
level with currently available drugs, Richard Geary, the
company’s senior vice president of clinical development, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
