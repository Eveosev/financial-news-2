Platinum prices that are headed for
their worst quarter in almost five years probably will rebound
in the last three months of 2013 as labor unrest disrupts
output, commodity researcher CPM Group said.  The precious metal may average $1,620 an ounce in the
fourth quarter, compared with $1,369.50 at close of trading on
June 21, New York-based Erica Rannestad, an analyst at CPM, said
in an interview before the release of the company’s annual
Platinum Group Metals Yearbook. Prices averaged $1,555 last
year. Global supplies of newly refined metal will trail demand
for a second year, she said.  Production declined as labor strikes and safety concerns
disrupted mining in  South Africa , the world’s biggest producer,
creating a deficit in 2012 that was the first after nine
straight years of surplus, according to CPM. Higher costs and
lower prices are prompting operators including  Anglo American
Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s largest miner of the metal, to
consider cutting back operations and reduce workers.  Fabrication demand remained little changed at 7.3 million
ounces last year from a year earlier, CPM said. The increase in
demand in  Japan  and higher jewelry sales in  China  was offset by
a slowdown in use by European automakers.  The metal tumbled 13 percent this quarter through June 21,
heading for the biggest slump since the three months ended Sept.
30, 2008.  Global palladium supplies fell 5.5 percent to 8.6 million
ounces last year, while fabrication demand rose 5 percent to 8.5
million ounces, helped by strong sales of passenger vehicles in
U.S., the report said.  The rhodium market dropped into a 43,000-ounce deficit last
year, after being in surplus since 2009, mainly as fabrication
demand grew amid a drop in supplies, CPM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
