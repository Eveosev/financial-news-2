U.S. home purchases by international
buyers fell 17 percent, to an estimated $68.2 billion, as
economic growth slowed in Europe and  Asia , the National
Association of Realtors said.  Sales of homes to overseas buyers totaled an estimated
$34.8 billion, while sales to long-term U.S. residents who
aren’t citizens were about $33.4 billion in the 12 months
through March, according to a report released today. All U.S.
home sales totaled $1.08 trillion during the period.  “Economic slowdowns in a number of major foreign economies
appear to have been a major reason for a drop in sales,” the
Realtors said. Sales to foreign buyers totaled $82.5 billion in
the previous 12-month period, according to the report.  The decline in international sales came as the U.S. housing
market recovers from its worst crash since the Great Depression
and has begun contributing again to economic growth. Gross
domestic product in the euro region, meanwhile, decreased 1.1
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, and probably
will fall 0.6 percent for all of 2013, according to the median
of 50 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. existing homes sold at an annual  pace  of 5.18 million
in May, their fastest since November 2009, when temporary tax
incentives spurred growth, the Realtors association said last
week. Prices jumped 15.4 percent from a year earlier to a median
$208,000.  In the year through March, Canadians accounted for 23
percent of international purchases, followed by buyers from
 China  at 12 percent,  Mexico  at 8 percent and India and the U.K.
at 5 percent each, according to today’s report.  Lower End  The value of sales declined, in part, because of more
transactions at the lower end of the market by foreign buyers,
the Realtors said. About 54 percent of reported international
purchases were under $250,000.  Chinese paid the highest median price at $425,000, compared
with $300,000 for buyers from India, $250,000 for Britons,
$183,000 for Canadians and $156,250 for Mexicans.  Homes in  Florida ,  California ,  Texas  and  Arizona  accounted
for 58 percent of purchases by foreigners. About half of
international buyers prefer to buy in the suburbs, and 64
percent of acquisitions were single-family residences, the group
said. The report was based on the responses of 3,357 Realtors
surveyed from April 9 to May 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
