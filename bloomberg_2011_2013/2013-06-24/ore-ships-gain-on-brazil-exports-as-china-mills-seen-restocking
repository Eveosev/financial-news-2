Rates to ship iron ore extended the
year’s biggest rally on speculation  Brazil  expanded exports as
Chinese  steel mills , the biggest buyers, rebuild stockpiles.  Daily earnings for Capesizes hauling about 160,000 metric
tons of the commodity used to make steel rose for a 13th
session, extending the longest winning streak since July,
according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based publisher of
shipping costs. Rates increased 9.9 percent to $12,158 a day,
the highest since Dec. 6.  Increased exports from Brazil created a temporary shortage
of vessels available to load in the Atlantic, according to RS
Platou Markets AS, the investment-banking unit of  Norway ’s
largest shipbroker. Chinese steelmakers are restocking as iron
ore and steel prices recover, Frode Moerkedal, an Oslo-based
analyst at Platou, said in an e-mailed report today.  “The strength in Capesize rates has coincided with
stronger buying interest for  iron ore ,” Moerkedal said in the
report. “The main region of strength has been the Atlantic due
to the recent upswing in Brazilian iron-ore exports and
temporary vessel tightness as few Capesize vessels have been
naturally positioned in the Atlantic.”  While imported ore with 62 percent iron content at the port
of Tianjin rose 5.6 percent this month to $116.60 a dry metric
ton, the price is still down from a 16-month high of $158.90 on
Feb. 20, according to Steel Index Ltd. Inventories at Chinese
ports rose 6.5 percent to 70.6 million tons from a four-year low
on March 8, according to Beijing Antaike Information Development
Co. Steel reinforcement bar futures in  Shanghai  rose 1.1 percent
this month to 3,431  yuan  ($564) a ton.  The Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of commodities
shipping costs, rose 3.4 percent to 1,062, according to the
exchange. Daily earnings for Panamaxes carrying about half as
much cargo as Capesizes increased 1 percent to $7,451. Rates for
Supramaxes and Handysizes, the smallest ship types tracked by
the index, each added less than 1 percent to $9,722 and $8,111,
respectively, figures showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
