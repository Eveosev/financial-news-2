(Corrects average inflation estimate after Bank of America
corrected its original forecast.)  Mexico’s  consumer prices 
unexpectedly fell in the first half of June, adding to pressure
on policy makers to keep  interest rates  on hold even as
inflation remains above the target range.  Prices slid 0.05 percent in the first two weeks of the
month, the national statistics agency said today on its website,
compared with the median estimate of 13 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg for an increase of 0.08 percent. Annual  inflation 
slowed to 4.24 percent from 4.63 percent in May, above the
central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target range after fruits
and vegetables dropped 5.06 percent. Core prices, which exclude
energy and farm costs, rose 0.07 percent in early June, compared
with an increase of 0.09 percent forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Policy makers said downside risks to  Latin America ’s
second-largest economy have “intensified” and inflation will
slow toward target, according to the minutes of the central
bank’s most recent rate decision. Even so, the peso’s plunge in
the past month due to speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
scale back its asset buying program has closed the door to a
second rate cut in Mexico this year, according to economists.  Inflation will slow slightly in June and more quickly
starting in July after picking up “significantly” in recent
months, policy makers said in the  minutes  to their June 7
decision, when they agreed unanimously to leave the key rate at
a record-low 4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
