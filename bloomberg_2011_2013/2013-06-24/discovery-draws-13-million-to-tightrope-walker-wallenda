Discovery Channel  said about 13
million viewers watched its telecast of Nik Wallenda becoming
the first person to cross the Grand Canyon on a tightrope.  The 23-minute segment, aired on June 23, in which Wallenda,
34, walked across the  Arizona  canyon, led the most-watched night
for the network since July 2010,  Silver Spring , Maryland-based
 Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) , said on its  website .  Wallenda, who tightrope-walked across Niagara Falls in
2012, crossed a 1,400-foot (426.7 meter) span of the Grand
Canyon without the use of a harness or restraint, the company
said yesterday. The section is about 1,500 feet above the Little
Colorado River, a height greater than the Empire State Building
in  New York ,  according  to Discovery.  The event, which occurred in a remote part of the Grand
Canyon run by the  Navajo Nation Parks and Recreation , was aired
live in the U.S. and in 223 countries.  The “Skywire Live with Nik Wallenda” pre-show averaged
6.25 million viewers, while the main event, which included the
walk segment, averaged an audience of 10.7 million, Discovery
said.  Wallenda, a seventh generation of the  Flying Wallenda
Family , used the event to honor his great grandfather, Karl
Wallenda, who died in 1978 from a tightrope fall in Puerto Rico.
Wallenda is planning his next feat, which may include stringing
a wire between the Empire State Building and Chrysler Building
in New York, according to Discovery.  Discovery, also owner of TLC and Animal Planet cable
channels, fell 0.4 percent to $75.14 at the close in New York
yesterday. The  stock  has climbed 18 percent this year, compared
with a 10 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
