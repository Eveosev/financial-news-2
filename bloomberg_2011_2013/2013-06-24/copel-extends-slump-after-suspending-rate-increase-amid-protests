Cia. Paranaense de Energia , the
Brazilian utility known as Copel, extended a decline to the
lowest in four years after suspending an electricity rate
increase as protests against the cost and poor quality of public
services spread across the nation.  The  shares  sank 5 percent to 24.90 reais at 12:00 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after touching 24.60 reais, the lowest intraday level
since April 2009. The drop follows a 17 percent slump in the
past session and compares with a 2.8 percent drop in the
benchmark Ibovespa today.  The suspension comes after a march against bus fares in Sao
Paulo triggered a slew of protests demanding better use of
public money this month across  Brazil ,  Latin America ’s largest
economy. The Curitiba, Brazil-based utility, which is controlled
by the southern Parana state, said it requested the
government’s power regulator suspend the rate increase in a
filing today.  Copel is seeking to “identify the best means of applying
the deferral to protect the company’s financial health,”
according to the statement.  Copel was authorized to raise consumer electricity rates by
13.4 percent and rates to industrial consumers by 14.9 percent,
power regulator Aneel said June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
