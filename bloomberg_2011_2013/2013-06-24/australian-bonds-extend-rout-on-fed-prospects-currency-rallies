Australian government bonds extended
their biggest rout since 2001, sending the 10-year yield to the
highest level in 14 months, on prospects that an early exit from
monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve will drain funds that
have helped inflate global asset prices.  The Aussie dollar fell as much as 0.7 percent to the lowest
since September 2010. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June
19 the U.S. central bank may slow quantitative easing this year
and end it in mid-2014 if economic improvement continues. The
 spread  between the  Australia ’s 3-year and 10-year yields widened
to the most since February 2010 before the Reserve Bank of
Australia meets on policy next week.  “This is all about tapering and what the Fed is going to
do having a knock-on effect around the world,” said Derek Mumford, a director at Rochford Capital, a currency risk-management company in Sydney. “We can look for yield-curve
steepening, with the short-term rates coming down as there’s
still potential for the RBA to cut rates and longer-term rates
pushing up.”  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year government bond surged 28
basis points, or 0.28 percentage point, the biggest jump since
January 2009, to close at 4.03 percent in Sydney, reaching the
highest since April 2012. The benchmark yield climbed 39 basis
points last week, the most since November 2001. The three-year
rate rose as much as 17 basis points to 3.01 percent, a level
unseen since March 26.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year notes
instead of 3-year securities was at 103 basis points, the most
since February 2010.  The Australian dollar fell 0.4 percent to 91.82 U.S. cents
at 5:39 p.m. in Sydney from June 21, when it capped a 3.7
percent weekly drop, the biggest since the five-days ended Sept.
23, 2011. It touched 91.57, the weakest since September 2010.  Kiwi Bonds  New Zealand’s kiwi dollar fell 0.1 percent to 77.40 U.S.
cents from the end of last week. It touched 77.01 on June 21,
the lowest in a year. New Zealand’s  10-year yield  climbed as
much as 14 basis points to 4.24 percent today, the highest since
April 2012. The nation’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment
made to receive a floating rate, reached 3.245 percent, matching
the highest since October 2011.  The U.S. central bank left the monthly pace of its bond
purchases unchanged at $85 billion at the conclusion of a policy
meeting on June 19, while saying that “downside risks to the
outlook for the economy and the labor market” have diminished.  Fed Index  The Fed Bank of  Dallas ’s  general economic index  probably
increased to minus 1 this month from minus 10.5 in May,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the data today.  Economists in a separate Bloomberg poll  estimate  the
Chicago Fed national index, a weighted average of 85 economic
indicators, improved to minus 0.15 in May from minus 0.53 a
month earlier.  Futures traders increased their bets that the Australian
dollar will decline against the U.S. dollar, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a gain --  so-called net shorts  -- was
63,521 on June 18, the most bearish in data going back to
January 1993 and compared with net shorts of 63,277 a week
earlier.  The Aussie’s relative strength index versus the greenback
was at 29 today, below the 30 level some traders see as a sign
that an asset’s price has fallen too rapidly and is poised to
reverse course.  Gillard Comment  Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard said an extension
of recent declines in the Aussie would help rebalance growth.  “A sustained depreciation of the Australian dollar in
those circumstances would be a very good thing, to stimulate
further growth in the non-mining sector -- while the firms that
have adjusted to the historically high dollar stand to benefit
from its fall,” Gillard said in a speech in Canberra today.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see about a 20 percent chance the RBA will lower its benchmark
for borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 2.50 percent at the
next meeting on July 2.  Demand for the Aussie and kiwi dollars was supported after
the People’s Bank of  China  said the nation should
“appropriately fine-tune” its policies, according to a
statement on its website yesterday that summarized the monetary
policy committee’s second-quarter meeting in Beijing.  It was the first time since September that the panel, led
by Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan , has used the “fine-tune” phrase,
suggesting officials are more open to loosening policies. China
is the biggest trading partner for both Australia and New
Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
