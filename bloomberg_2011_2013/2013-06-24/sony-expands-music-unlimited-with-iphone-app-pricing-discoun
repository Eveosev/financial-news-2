Sony Corp. (6758) , owner of the world’s
second-biggest record company, is expanding features of its
Music Unlimited streaming service to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone and
cutting prices in half to challenge industry leader Spotify Ltd.  Owners of iPhone and iPod Touch devices will be able to
store music on the devices for listening when  Internet service 
isn’t available, Sony Entertainment Network said today on its
 website . The feature, already offered by Spotify, Rdio Inc. and
Rhapsody International Inc., is under review by Apple and should
be available soon, according to the statement.  Sony, playing catchup in Web-based on-demand music, lowered
prices below the $10-a-month  charged  by Spotify and other
competitors. Subscribers to PlayStation Plus, a $50-a-year
 premium  video-game service, can add Music Unlimited for $42,
while general customers can get an annual subscription for $60,
according to the statement.  Music Unlimited subscribers can access 20 million songs and
personalized music channels on the Sony video-game players,
Bravia TVs, PCs, and devices running Apple iOS or Google Inc.’s
Android operating system, the company said.  The service, which can be purchased through the Music
Unlimited app for the PlayStation 3 or online, is available in
the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands,  New Zealand ,
Norway, Spain and Sweden.  Sony fell 1.8 percent to 1,966 yen in Tokyo. The  shares 
have more than doubled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
