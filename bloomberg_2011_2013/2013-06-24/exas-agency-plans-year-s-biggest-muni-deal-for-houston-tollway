The Grand Parkway Transportation
Corp., created to finance construction of a highway around
Houston, is set to sell about $2.9 billion of toll-revenue debt
in mid-July.  It is the first borrowing for the agency and it would be
the biggest sale this year in the $3.7 trillion municipal
market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Goldman Sachs & Co.
will underwrite the deal.  Proceeds will finance segments of the Grand Parkway
project, a 180-mile (290-kilometer) loop around the Houston
metropolitan area. The city is the nation’s fourth-largest by
population, with about 2.2 million residents.  Mark Cross, a spokesman for the Texas Department of
Transportation, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
message and e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
