Haiti , the Western Hemisphere’s
poorest country with about 80 percent of the population living
on less than $2 a day, will get an Inter-American Development
Bank grant to expand water services in the capital.  The Washington-based lender said today that the $35.5
million grant will help support the second phase of a water and
sanitation program to boost drinking-water supplies, reduce
losses from leaks and clandestine connections, and improve
chlorination and bacteriological tests in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti’s most populous city.  An outbreak of cholera in Haiti was blamed on United
Nations peacekeepers following their arrival after a January
2010 earthquake, which killed about 200,000 people in the former
French colony that shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola
with the  Dominican Republic .  To contact the reporter on this story:
