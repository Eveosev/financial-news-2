KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by billionaires  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , agreed to
buy U.S. clinical-research company PRA International from
Genstar Capital LLC.  The deal is expected to close in the third quarter, North
Carolina-based PRA said in an e-mailed statement today. The
purchase price was $1.3 billion, according to a person briefed
on the matter who asked not to be identified because the terms
haven’t been disclosed publicly.  Genstar, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, bought
PRA, which helps pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
develop  prescription drugs , for $790 million in December 2007.
New York-based KKR has invested more than $9 billion in health
care globally since 1995, including its acquisition with Bain
Capital LLC and Merrill Lynch & Co. of HCA Inc. in 2006 for $32
billion.  PRA is “one of the fastest growing companies” in the
contract-research organization industry, Jim Momtazee, head of
KKR’s health care investing team, said in the statement. “PRA
management and KKR share the common ambition of building on this
platform by continually improving service offerings to
clients.”  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Jefferies Group LLC,  UBS AG (UBSN) , and
KKR Capital Markets are arranging debt financing for the deal,
PRA said in the statement. Jefferies acted as financial adviser
to PRA with Latham & Watkins LLP acting as legal adviser.  Credit Suisse, UBS and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  advised KKR, with
Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP serving as legal counsel.
