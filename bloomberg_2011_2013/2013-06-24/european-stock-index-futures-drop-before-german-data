European stocks fell for a fifth
day, erasing their gains for the year, as Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut  China ’s growth forecast amid concern banks in the
world’s second-largest economy face a cash crunch.  Erste Group Bank AG tumbled the most in 17 months as it
planned a rights offer to repay state aid. Kazakhmys Plc plunged
to a four-year low as it backed a bid to take Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp. private. Kabel Deutschland Holding AG rose 1.7
percent after Vodafone Group Plc offered to buy the German cable
company for 7.7 billion euros ($10.1 billion).  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 1.7 percent to 275.66
at the close in London. The equity benchmark has entered a so-called correction, having  slumped  11 percent since May 22, when
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke commented on the
possibility of paring bond purchases.  “What we’re seeing is a shift in the policy agenda of
China which will take place in the next six to nine months,”
James Bevan, who oversees about 4.2 billion pounds ($6.5
billion) as chief investment officer at CCLA Investment
Management Ltd. in London, told Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg
Television. “During that period, we will have continued
volatility and continued uncertainty. It will be painful as the
adjustment goes through.”  The Stoxx 600 is heading for an 8.4 percent drop in June,
its biggest  monthly loss  since August 2011. The VStoxx Index, a
measure of expected volatility in euro-area stocks, jumped 5.2
percent to the highest level since February.  China Outlook  China’s stocks plunged the most since August 2009 -- and
the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  extended its decline from a February high to
more than 20 percent -- after the country’s central bank
signaled it will maintain efforts to curb speculative lending.  Separately, Goldman Sachs cut its estimate for China’s
economic growth this year to 7.4 percent from an earlier
prediction of 7.8 percent, citing weaker economic indicators and
tighter financial conditions.  While money-market rates in the country fell for a second
day from a record, the overnight repurchase rate of 6.47 percent
was still more than double this year’s average of 3.09 percent,
according to a fixing compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  In  Germany , data showed that  business confidence  increased
in June in line with economists’ estimates. The Ifo institute’s
 business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
rose to 105.9 this month from 105.7 in May.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes fell in all of the 17 western
European markets trading today, except Iceland. The U.K.’s FTSE
100 retreated 1.4 percent, while  France ’s CAC 40 declined 1.7
percent. Germany’s DAX dropped 1.2 percent.  Greece  was closed
for Whit Monday holiday.  The volume of shares traded on companies listed in the
Stoxx 600 was 28 percent greater than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Erste tumbled 8.5 percent to 20.09 euros, its biggest drop
since January 2012. Austria’s biggest lender plans to increase
its share capital by 660 million euros in the third quarter as
it redeems participation capital of 1.76 billion euros. Erste
also cut its earnings outlook, saying it expects its pre-provision operating profit to decline by 5 percent this year.  ENRC Offer  Kazakhmys, which owns 26 percent of ENRC, plunged 13
percent to 233.7 pence, its lowest price since February 2009.
ENRC founders and the Kazakh government made an offer valuing
the mining company at 3.04 billion pounds. They offered
shareholders $2.65 in cash and 0.23 Kazakhmys shares for each
ENRC share held.  A  gauge  of mining companies in the Stoxx 600 slumped to its
lowest level since July 2009. Rio Tinto Group, the second-largest commodity producer, declined 3.4 percent to  2,582 pence
and Anglo American Plc fell 4 percent to 1,297.5 pence.  Metro AG lost 5.5 percent to 23.55 euros, the biggest drop
since March 4. Citigroup Inc. downgraded the German retailer to
sell from neutral, citing weaker growth in  Russia  and other
 emerging markets .  Nokia Oyj retreated 4 percent to 2.88 euros, its sharpest
decline in a month, and Alcatel-Lucent SA lost 4.8 percent to
1.39 euros, contributing to a decline in an  index  of technology
shares in the Stoxx 600.  Kabel Deutschland advanced 1.7 percent to 85.50 euros.
Vodafone, the world’s second-biggest wireless carrier, raised
its bid for Kabel Deutschland to 87 euros a share from the
initial 80 euros. The German cable company said its board plans
to recommend the cash offer to its shareholders.  Fiat SpA rose 3.8 percent to 5.33 euros as people familiar
with the matter said the Italian carmaker may triple its
dividend earned from Chrysler Group LLC, in which it holds a
58.5 percent controlling stake. Fiat may collect $936 million in
2013, from a previous maximum of $300 million, after the U.S.
automaker refinanced its debt with new covenants that eased
restrictions on dividend payment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
