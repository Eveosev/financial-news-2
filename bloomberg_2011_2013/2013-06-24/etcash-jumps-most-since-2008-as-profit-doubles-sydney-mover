Metcash Ltd. (MTS) ,  Australia ’s largest
grocery wholesaler, jumped the most in more than four years in
Sydney trading after full-year earnings more than doubled.  The stock climbed 6.8 percent to A$3.675, the most since
Oct. 1, 2008, at 11:32 a.m. local time.  Net income  in the year
ended April 30 surged to A$206 million ($190 million) from A$90
million a year earlier, Metcash said in a statement today.  Liquor sales jumped 25 percent while revenue at the
hardware and automotive business rose 13 percent, Sydney-based
Metcash said. Earnings met targets even amid falling prices and
competition between Australia’s two largest supermarket chains,
 Woolworths Ltd. (WOW)  and Wesfarmers Ltd.-owned Coles.  “It is a challenging time for the independent retail
sector with  consumer confidence  low and the self-service
supermarket chains locked in a marketing war,” Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Reitzer said in the statement. “We are pleased
to announce a full-year result that meets our guidance amid
tough trading conditions.”  Food and grocery sales fell 2.3 percent to A$9.1 billion
due largely to store closures, the company said. Reitzer steps
down June 30 and will be replaced by Ian Morrice.  Metcash plans to pay a final dividend of 16.5 Australian
cents a share, taking the full-year payout to 28 cents. That
matches last year’s total, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
