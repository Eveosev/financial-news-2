The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
said it will begin tomorrow a third series of “small-value”
repurchase agreements using all eligible collateral types as
part of readiness testing of its operational tools.  The open-market operations don’t represent any change in
monetary policy, the New York Fed said in a  statement  today. The
 Federal Open Market Committee  previously authorized the New York
Fed to undertake repos and outright purchases and sales of
securities, in addition to reverse repos, for such testing, the
New York Fed said. The Fed did a round of repo testing last year
in August and again in January.  Prior to the transaction in August, the New York Fed hadn’t
conducted a repo since Dec. 30, 2008. The New York Fed has 21
primary dealers.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
so-called agency debt from dealers for a set period, temporarily
raising the amount of money available in the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers, and the
cash to the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
