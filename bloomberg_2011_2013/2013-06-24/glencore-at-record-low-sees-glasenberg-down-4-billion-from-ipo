Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ’s record low in
London trading today means Ivan Glasenberg has seen the value of
his stake in the commodities empire he runs slide by 2.8 billion
pounds ($4.3 billion) since its 2011 initial public offering.  Glencore, the world’s largest exporter of power-station
coal, has slumped 47 percent since selling shares at 530 pence
apiece in May 2011. It fell 4.7 percent to close at 273.45 pence
today. That values Chief Executive Officer Glasenberg’s 8.3
percent holding at about 3 billion pounds, compared with about
5.8 billion pounds at the time of the IPO.  Since Glencore sold $10 billion of shares more than two
years ago commodity prices have dropped 18 percent, according to
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Commodity Index, amid concern
slowing economic growth in  China  will curb demand for metals.
Glencore’s 22 percent drop this year compares with the 34
percent retreat among the 115-member Bloomberg World Mining
Index. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment.  Glencore completed a $29 billion all-share takeover of
Xstrata Plc last month to add coal, nickel, zinc and copper
mines to its cotton-to-crude oil trading network and create the
world’s fourth-biggest mining company.  Copper fell to the lowest price in three years in New York
today on concerns that demand is slowing as stockpiles monitored
by the London Metal Exchange reach a 10-year high. Futures for
September delivery dropped 2.6 percent to $3.021 a pound as of
11:50 a.m. on the Comex in New York after touching $2.9935, the
lowest level for a most-active contract since July 20, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
