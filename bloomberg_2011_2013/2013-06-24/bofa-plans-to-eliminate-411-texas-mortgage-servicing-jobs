Bank of America Corp. , the second-largest U.S. lender by assets, told Texas regulators last week
it will cut 411 jobs from a unit servicing troubled mortgages.  The bank will eliminate 324 positions at 2375 Glenville Dr.
in Richardson and 87 jobs at 1201 Main St. in  Dallas , according
to letters dated June 19. Workers were notified earlier this
month of reductions to be completed Sept. 30, John Collingwood,
a Bank of America senior vice president of government relations,
said in the correspondence.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  has targeted $8
billion in annual costs and 30,000 jobs in his efficiency plan,
Project New BAC. Many of those cuts are in the unit created in
2011 to service delinquent and risky mortgages. The lender said
in April it had 667,000 overdue loans as of March 31, compared
with 1.6 million at the height of the financial crisis.  “There’s nothing more important in our company than
getting this done as quickly as possible,” Moynihan, 53, said
of the loan-servicing job eliminations on Jan. 17.  Workers are offered career-transition resources, severance
pay and benefits, Collingwood wrote.  Earlier this year, the firm said it planned to shut an
office near Buffalo,  New York , affecting 1,320 jobs and one in
 Newark  with 469 positions. Bank of America had 262,812 employees
as of March 30, a drop of 5.7 percent from a year earlier.  Bank of America won’t sacrifice the level of service it
provides to homeowners in need of help,  Jumana Bauwens , a
company spokeswoman, said today in an e-mail. The firm had
previously said it would reduce the size of its legacy mortgage
unit as its portfolio of delinquent customers shrinks, she
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
