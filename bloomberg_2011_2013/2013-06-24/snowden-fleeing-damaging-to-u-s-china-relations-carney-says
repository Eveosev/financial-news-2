Hong Kong’s decision to let fugitive
Edward Snowden leave for Moscow “unquestionably” damages U.S.
relations with China, President  Barack Obama ’s spokesman said.  The U.S. government has expressed its “frustration and
disappointment with Hong Kong and China” for letting Snowden
flee, White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said today.  Snowden, a former government computer security contractor
who is charged with violating the Espionage Act, is believed to
be in Moscow and the U.S. is in contact with Russian
authorities, Carney said at a briefing in Washington.  While refusing to specifically say that Snowden’s passport
was revoked, Carney said Hong Kong officials knew “in plenty of
time” the status of Snowden’s travel documents.  Carney wouldn’t discuss any negotiations with Russian
President Vladimir Putin’s government, saying the U.S. has “a
fairly substantial history of law enforcement cooperation” with
 Russia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
