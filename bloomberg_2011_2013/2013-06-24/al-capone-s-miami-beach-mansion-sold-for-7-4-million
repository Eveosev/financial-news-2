One of America’s most notorious gangsters didn’t go down in a gunfight, but died of heart failure in a luxe Miami Beach mansion in 1947. Al Capone’s last years were spent at the Palm Island residence in relative anonymity. It’s where he decided to retire and reportedly where he planned his final Chicago event: the 1929 St. Valentine’s Day Massacre. The home served as his alibi. Capone made sure everyone saw him in South Beach the day of the murders. Capone’s notorious final residence recently sold for $7,431,750, according to property records. It was  listed in 2012 for $9.95 million . Capone reportedly purchased the home for $40,000 cash from Clarence Busch of the Anheuser-Busch family. Capone set about making the enormous 30,000-square-foot property his own, adding a 30-by-60-foot pool, a two-story cabana pool house — to house his guards — as well as another guesthouse and gated guard house in the front of the mansion. Listed as one of America’s Most Wanted criminals, Capone had reason to add numerous guards, but the mobster also suffered from syphilis in his later years and was reportedly paranoid that he would be arrested or attacked at any moment. Even the guards gave him no peace;  historians say Capone’s final years were not the happiest . He spent his final days in the guest bedroom in the front of the house where he could always see who was coming and going. Capone’s home has only passed through a few owners since and was recently completely renovated while still maintaining the Havana style. Click here for a YouTube video about the house.
