South African white corn futures
declined to the lowest level since June 19 as the weather
improved in the country, increasing the rate of growth for crops
in some growing regions.  “The weather outlook across the corn belt is favorable,”
Lindy van Blommestein, a trader at Johannesburg-based Farmwise
Grains (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions
today.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 0.8 percent to 2,308 rand ($225) a metric ton, the lowest
since June 19, by the midday close in Johannesburg. The yellow
variety for delivery in the same month declined 0.6 percent to
2,280 rand a ton.  Sunny, warm temperatures are forecast for the town of
Lichtenburg in the North West province for the whole week, the
 South African Weather Service  said on its website. The province
produces 16 percent of the nation’s corn, according to the
nation’s Grain Information Service.  “Temperatures which will increase will be ideal for crops
and help speed growth thus the downward movement today,” Van
Blommestein said.  Meal made from white corn is a staple food in  South Africa ,
the continent’s largest producer of the grain. The yellow
variant is mainly used to feed animals.  Wheat for July delivery lost 0.8 percent to 3,595 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
