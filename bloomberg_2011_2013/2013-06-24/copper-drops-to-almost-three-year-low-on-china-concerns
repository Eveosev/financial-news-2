Copper fell to the lowest level in
20 months as China’s stocks entered a  bear market  and
inventories climbed. Aluminum had the longest run of declines in
26 years, while other industrial metals also dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months declined as much as 2.6
percent to $6,640.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
the lowest since October 2011, and was at $6,672.75 at 3:52 p.m.
in  Shanghai . Aluminum fell 0.7 percent, losing for the 13th
straight day, the longest run of declines going back to 1987.  LME copper inventories rose 3.4 percent to 664,850 tons on
June 21, the highest since July 2003, while those tallied by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed for a fourth week to 189,209
tons. China’s CSI 300 Index slid 22 percent from this year’s
closing high amid concern lower liquidity will hurt growth in
the world’s second-largest economy.  “A cash crunch led to a rather pessimistic view on  China ,
the largest user,” Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai CIFCO
Futures Co. China accounts for more than 40 percent of global
copper consumption, according to Bloomberg Industry data.  Production at the Indonesian unit of Phoenix-based
Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. began gradually since June
22, spokeswoman Daisy Primayanti said today. Grasberg is the
world’s second-biggest copper mine.  Metal for delivery in October on the SHFE closed 3.4
percent lower at 47,950  yuan  ($7,810) a ton, while the September
futures contract on the Comex in  New York  dropped 2.7 percent to
$3.0150 per pound.  Net-short positions, or wagers on falling Comex prices,
held by funds expanded to 29,018 futures and options as of June
18 from 18,722 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
