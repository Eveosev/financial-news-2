Copper fell to the lowest in almost
three years in  New York  on concern that slowing growth in China
will curb demand as inventories reach a 10-year high. Aluminum
extended the longest slump since at least 1987.  China’s central bank said there’s a reasonable amount of
liquidity in the financial system and urged banks to control
risks from credit expansion, signaling no relief from a cash
squeeze. Copper stockpiles monitored by the London Metal
Exchange climbed to the highest since June 2003 and  Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg mine in Indonesia is
resuming output after a tunnel collapsed on May 14.  “China’s credit crunch is exacerbating a slowdown there
that was already going on,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a
telephone interview. “That’s going to slow world demand for
copper. And inventories are growing.”  Copper futures for September delivery fell 2.3 percent to
settle at $3.0285 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex in New York
after touching $2.9935, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 20, 2010. Trading volume in New York was 38 percent
higher than the average for the past 100 days at this time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chinese equities plunged the most in four years, and the
CSI 300 Index entered a  bear market . The nation’s overnight
repurchase rate is 6.47 percent, more than double this year’s
average, according to a fixing compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  As of June 18, funds boosted net-short positions to 29,018
futures and options, the biggest bet on lower copper prices
since April, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.  Inventory Gains  LME copper inventories increased 2 percent to 678,225
metric tons on deliveries in  New Orleans , the Belgian port of
Antwerp and Johor,  Malaysia . Stockpiles have more than doubled
this year, with about 47 percent waiting to be delivered.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months declined
2.2 percent to $6,670 a ton ($3.03 a pound).  Aluminum for delivery in three months on the LME fell 1.2
percent to $1,771.50 a ton, after touching $1,762.50, the lowest
since July 23, 2009. Prices fell for the 13th consecutive
session, the longest slump since at least June 1987, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nickel, tin, zinc and lead also
slid in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
