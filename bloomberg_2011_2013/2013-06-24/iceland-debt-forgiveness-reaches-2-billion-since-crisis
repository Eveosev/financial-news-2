Iceland’s lenders have forgiven
 household debt  equal to about 12.4 percent of gross domestic
product since the island’s 2008 financial collapse.  Lenders had written off 212.2 billion kronur ($1.7 billion)
in household debt through the end of 2012, the  Icelandic
Financial Services Association  said in a  letter to parliament .
The group estimated a further 35.3 billion kronur will be
forgiven this year after they recalculate loan agreements to
meet a Supreme Court ruling.  About 141.2 billion kronur of that follows a ruling from
the island’s top court stating that  mortgage loans  indexed to
foreign exchange rates were illegal, it said.  The island’s biggest banks failed in October 2008, after
defaulting on about $85 billion in debt. The collapse plunged
the island’s economy into a crisis that sent unemployment
surging nine-fold and triggered a recession.  The association said that of the total, 45.8 billion kronur
in private debt was forgiven as part of an agreement that
stipulated that debts exceeding 110 percent of a property’s
value must be written off.  To contact the reporter on this story:
