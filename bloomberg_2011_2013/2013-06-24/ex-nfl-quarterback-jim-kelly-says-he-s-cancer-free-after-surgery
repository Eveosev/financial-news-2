Hall of Fame quarterback  Jim Kelly 
said he won’t need radiation or chemotherapy after having
surgery to remove part of his jaw following a cancer diagnosis.  Kelly, 53, who disclosed this month that he had squamous
cell carcinoma in his upper jaw bone, said today at the opening
of his football camp that he is free of the disease following
June 7 surgery, according to the Buffalo Bills’  website .  “I found out the great news on Wednesday,” Kelly said.
“From everything that they did in surgery, if I had to do
radiation or chemo it would put me way back.”  Kelly had the left side of his jaw, all the teeth on the
left side of his mouth and several front teeth removed. He then
had skin, taken from his left leg, grafted to the area. He
described his mouth as being “very, very sore” and said he’s
lost about 15 pounds because of food restrictions.  Kelly led the Bills to four straight Super Bowl appearances
from 1991 to 1994. He was inducted into the Canton, Ohio-based
Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002 after playing his entire
National Football League career with the Bills from 1986 to
1996.  To contact the reporter on this story:
