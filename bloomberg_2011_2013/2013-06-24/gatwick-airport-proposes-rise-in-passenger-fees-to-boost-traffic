Gatwick Airport seeks to increase
passenger fees by almost 11 percent in the seven years to 2021
as London’s second busiest airport attempts to improve
facilities while expanding traffic.  The airport has asked the U.K.’s  Civil Aviation Authority 
to approve a per-passenger price increase to 9.76 pounds
($15.08) in fiscal year 2021, compared with a fee of 8.80 pounds
in the 2014 to 2015 financial year, Gatwick said in a statement.  The U.K. regulator sets the maximum amount London’s three
largest airports can charge airlines to use their facilities and
must approve the spending plans of Heathrow, the city’s largest
hub, Gatwick and Stansted. While the fees drive up ticket prices
for passengers, they also underpin investment intended to keep
the pace with rivals including Paris’s Charles de Gaulle and
Frankfurt airports.  “We hope that the CAA will feel sufficiently confident to
endorse our deal as the preferred way forward for Gatwick in its
October final proposals,” Gatwick Chief Executive Officer
Stewart Wingate said in the statement.  The CAA proposed a price cap of the U.K.’s retail price
index plus 1 percent for the five-year period starting March
2014 for Gatwick earlier this year. The price commitment issued
today equates to RPI plus 1.5 percent over a seven-year period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
