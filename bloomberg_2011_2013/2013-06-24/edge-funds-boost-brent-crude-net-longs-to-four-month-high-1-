(Corrects gasoil net-long in seventh paragraph.)  Hedge funds  and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to their highest level in
four months, according to data from ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 185,653 lots in
the week ended June 18, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The increase of 25,620
contracts, or 16 percent, is the biggest jump in percentage
terms since Jan. 29 and brings net-long positions to the highest
since Feb. 19.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 394,324 lots,
rising 8.4 percent from the previous week to their highest net-short position since at least January 2011, the starting point
for the data.  Brent climbed 3 percent in the week to June 18 to $106.02,
and traded at $100.50 a barrel as of 1:36 p.m. London time.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators as well as commercial
companies that buy or sell futures to protect against price
moves. Analysts and investors follow changes in speculatorsâ€™
positions because such transactions can reflect an expectation
of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers  were net-long 241,098 lots, down 1.7 percent
from a week earlier to the lowest since April 23.  ICE also reported data on trader positions for European
gasoil, which shifted to a net-long position from net-short for
the first time since April 23, increasing their bullish bets by
29,256 lots to 26,176 contracts, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
