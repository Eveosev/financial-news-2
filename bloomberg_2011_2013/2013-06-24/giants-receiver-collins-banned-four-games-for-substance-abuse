New York Giants wide receiver
Brandon Collins was suspended for four games without pay for
violating the  National Football League ’s substance-abuse policy.  Collins, 24, will sit out New York’s first four games of
the season, the Giants said in an e-mailed statement citing the
league. Details of the violation weren’t disclosed.  Collins signed with the Giants as a rookie free agent last
year. He appeared in three preseason games without making a
catch.  Collins is allowed to participate in all offseason
practices and preseason games, according to the release. He is
eligible to return to the active roster on Sept. 30, the day
after the Giants play the  Kansas City Chiefs .  To contact the reporters on this story:
