Canadian stocks fell to a seven-month low as commodities producers slumped amid concern a cash
crunch in  China  will hurt growth in the world’s biggest consumer
of materials and energy.  All 10 industries in the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index (SPTSX)  retreated, led by a 3.8 percent decline in raw-materials
producers.  Teck Resources (TCK/B)  Ltd. and Endeavour Silver Corp. lost
at least 6.8 percent as copper and silver prices tumbled.
Enbridge Inc. slid 2 percent as three oil pipelines in Alberta
remained closed by a leak related to flooding.  The S&P/TSX fell 158.80 points, or 1.3 percent, to
11,836.86 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the lowest level since Nov. 15.
The benchmark index is down 4.8 percent this year. Trading
volume was 2.7 percent below than the 30-day average.  “There’s weakness across the board. It’s getting ugly,”
said  John Kinsey ,  fund manager  with Caldwell Securities Ltd. in
Toronto. He helps manage about C$1 billion ($953 million).
“People are very nervous on a number of fronts. Europe is just
a mess but China and the U.S. are the two economies that
everybody is focused on. China numbers show the economy is
slowing there. That is something that has everybody worried.”  The S&P/TSX extended its monthly loss to 6.4 percent as
China’s central bank signaled it would provide no relief from a
cash squeeze. China is the world’s second-largest economy and
Canada’s second-biggest trading partner behind the U.S. The
country’s benchmark money-market  rates  last week climbed to a
record as the central bank refrained from using open-market
operations to provide liquidity.  U.S. Data  Investors are also considering whether growth in the U.S.
is strong enough for the Fed to begin phasing out stimulus later
this year. U.S.  durable goods  orders probably rose and  house
prices  continued to recover, economists said before reports this
week. The S&P/TSX trimmed an early drop of 2 percent after Fed
Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said investors shouldn’t
overreact to plans to slow bond purchases.  Each of the benchmark index’s 10 sectors retreated at least
0.4 percent. The index that tracks producers of raw materials
plunged 3.8 percent to the lowest since December 2008 as all but
one of its 55 members declined.  Teck Resources, Canada’s largest diversified miner, fell
6.8 percent to C$21.22 and Endeavor Silver slid 10 percent to
C$3.35, its lowest level since August 2010. Copper futures
plunged to the lowest in almost three years and silver lost 1.8
percent.  Energy producers  declined 1.5 percent.  Oil prices  rose for
the first time in four days on supply concerns, reversing an
early drop that took crude to a three-week low. Niko Resources
Ltd. fell 2.3 percent to C$6.85 and Penn West Petroleum Ltd.
lost 2.4 percent to C$11.29.  Enbridge dropped 2 percent to C$42.64. The company closed
one pipeline after discovering a 750-barrel spill on June 22.
Two more lines, also in Alberta, were shut as a precaution.
Enbridge, Canada’s biggest pipeline operator, has not given a
timeline for service resumption. Alberta has the third-largest
proven oil reserves in the world, after  Saudi Arabia  and
 Venezuela , according to the provincial government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
