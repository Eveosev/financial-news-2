Militants fired at an army convoy in
India-controlled Kashmir on the eve of Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s visit to the region, killing four soldiers and injuring
six others.  Guerrillas attacked the vehicles on the outskirts of
Srinagar, the summer capital of India’s northern state of Jammu
and Kashmir, said Naresh Vij, a spokesman for the army.  Singh is scheduled to visit the Kashmir valley tomorrow to
inaugurate a rail link connecting it with Jammu. Today’s strike
is the second in three days after militants gunned down two
policemen in Srinagar at the weekend. Ruling Congress party
President  Sonia Gandhi  will accompany Singh.  The militant group Hizbul Mujahideen claimed responsibility
for today’s attack, the  Press Trust of India  reported.  Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan since 1947 and
claimed in full by both, has been the cause of two wars between
the nuclear-armed neighbors. Tourists returned to Kashmir in
record numbers over the last year as violence linked to a
separatist insurgency that erupted in 1989 continued to ebb.  The two nations have repaired economic and sporting ties
since resuming peace talks snapped by the 2008 raid on Mumbai by
Pakistani guerrillas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
