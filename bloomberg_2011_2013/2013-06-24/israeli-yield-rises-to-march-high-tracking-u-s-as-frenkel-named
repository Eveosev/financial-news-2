Israeli benchmark bonds dropped for
a fifth day, sending the yield to a three-month high, amid a
global selloff in government debt and as Jacob Frenkel was
nominated to succeed  Stanley Fischer  as central bank governor.  The yield on the 4.25 percent notes due March 2023 climbed
five basis points, or 0.05 of a percentage point, to 3.93
percent, the highest since March 24, at the close in Tel Aviv.
The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  of stocks dropped 1 percent. The
shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.6366 a dollar at 6:05 p.m.
after the central bank left  interest rates  at 1.25 percent
following two rate cuts last month.  Israel’s bond yield has advanced 24 basis points in the
past week as the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to the highest
since 2011 before U.S. data this week forecast to add to the
case for the  Federal Reserve  to slow bond purchases. Selling
pressure today hasn’t been affected by the appointment of
Frenkel, chairman of  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  International, said Shuki Arditi, a bond trader at  Leader Capital Markets (LDRC)  Ltd.  “In this environment it’s difficult for investors for the
moment to price in the impact of the new governor,” Tel Aviv-based Arditi said by phone. “The  bond market  is reacting to
rising yields in the U.S.”  Frenkel, who served as  Bank of Israel  governor between 1991
and 2000, is taking the regulator’s top job at a time when the
economy is contending with slowing growth, a strengthening
shekel and surging housing prices. Frenkel is an “excellent”
choice because he has the right experience to stabilize Israel’s
slowing economy, Finance Minister Yair Lapid said in an Army
Radio interview today.  Rate Decision  “What remains to be seen is if he will continue Fischer’s
interventionist path of buying dollars to moderate shekel
gains,” Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading for Tel Aviv-based
 Bank Leumi Le-Israel (LUMI) , said by phone.  Fischer, who steps down at the end of the month, announced
a program in May to buy foreign currency in a bid to trim the
shekel’s gains amid slowing economic growth. The shekel has
appreciated 2.7 percent this year, the most among 31 major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The central bank expects the base lending rate of 1.25
percent “to remain at this level in the coming year,”
according to an e-mailed statement. Thirteen 13 out of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the move. The economy
will probably expand 3.2 percent in 2014, down from 3.8 percent
this year, the central bank said today. To support growth, the
regulator has cut the base lending rate by two percentage points
since 2011.  One-year interest swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates over the period, advanced one basis point
to 1.25 percent.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 1.35 billion shekels ($371
million) of bonds today at the last auction of the month, its
data on Bloomberg show. Investors sought 5.5 times the 250
million shekels of 2023 benchmark bonds at the sale, up from 3.4
times at a 200 million-shekel offering on June 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
