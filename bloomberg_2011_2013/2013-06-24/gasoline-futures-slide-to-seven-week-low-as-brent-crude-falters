Gasoline sank to a seven-week low as
 Brent crude  weakened to its poorest performance in two years
against West Texas Intermediate after three Canadian pipelines
were shut. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures slipped 0.9 percent, capping the biggest three-day
slide since April 5, as Brent crude’s premium to WTI touched
$5.93 a barrel, making processing oil priced off Brent less
expensive.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  said it has no timeframe for restarting
the three lines, shut since June 22 after a leak. Gasoline’s
 crack spread  versus WTI narrowed $2.31 to $19.36 a barrel, the
lowest level since January 2012.  “The market clearly thinks it’s going to impact structure
and it may have a supply impact,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior
vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “Nothing is
coming out of Enbridge so the market is nervous that there’s
more there than meets the eye. The Brent-WTI spread is
exploding.”  July-delivery gasoline fell 2.41 cents to $2.7376 a gallon
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
May 1. Volume was 9.8 percent above the 100-day average at 3:03
p.m.  The fuel’s  premium  over Brent fell $1.07 to $13.38, a four-month low.  Brent weakened on speculation the shutdown of the three
pipelines in Canada, the largest source of crude imports, will
increase demand for WTI, particularly from Midwestern refineries
who may turn for supply to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the crude storage
hub and delivery point for the WTI contract.  Demand for Cushing oil may also jump when Enbridge reopens
a line carrying oil from the hub to  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s 356,000-barrel-a-day Wood River refinery in  Illinois . That line is
scheduled to start up June 29.  Given Up  “Brent has finally given it up,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Brent oil for August delivery increased 25 cents to settle
at $101.16 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Exchange.
Brent was at a $5.98 premium to WTI, the lowest based on
settlement prices since January 2011.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.6 cent
to $3.567 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on
its website. Prices have retreated 12 consecutive days and are
the lowest since May 9.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel rose as the front-month contract
for gasoil in Europe was valued higher than later months for a
fourth straight day. Royal Dutch Shell Plc halted maintenance
activities at its 404,000-barrrel-a-day Pernis  refinery  in the
Netherlands after an odor was detected.  Gasoil Strong  “Gasoil spreads are very strong and Shell just extended
maintenance at its Pernis refinery,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in
 London .  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery rose 1.06 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.8547 a gallon on trading volume that was
30 percent above the 100-day average at 3:21 p.m. Prices fell 4
percent last week.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed $1.08 to $24.65 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  was 16 cents higher at $18.67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
