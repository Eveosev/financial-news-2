Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement maker, agreed to sell its North American Gypsum business
with an enterprise value of $700 million to an affiliate of Lone
Star Funds.  The business, which manufactures gypsum wallboards and
joint compounds in plants in the U.S. and  Canada , had 2012 sales
of $310 million, the  Paris-based company said in e-mailed
statement today.  The deal, which is predicted to close “very soon,” will
help Lafarge to focus on the cement, aggregates and ready-mix
concrete businesses, the company said.  Chief Executive Officer Bruno Lafont is selling assets to
repair a  credit rating  that has fallen below investment grade.
He’s also cutting jobs and procurement costs and pushing sales
of higher-margin services and products to counter a construction
slump in Europe and political turmoil in the Middle East.  The stock rose 1.9 percent in Paris trading today, giving
the company a market value of 13.6 billion euros ($17.8
billion). Lafarge has dropped 2.2 percent this year, while the
French benchmark CAC 40 index declined 1.3 percent.  Lafarge’s  debt  shrank by 4 percent at the end of first
quarter from a year earlier to 11.8 billion euros. Lafont has
set a goal to trim the company’s debt below 10 billion euros
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
