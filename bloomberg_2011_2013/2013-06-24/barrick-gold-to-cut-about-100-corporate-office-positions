Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s
largest producer of the metal, plans to cut about 100 office
jobs after the price of the metal slumped.  The reductions, which represent as much as 30 percent of
Toronto-based Barrick’s total number of corporate office
positions, are being made amid a “challenging business
environment,” the company said today in an e-mail. Barrick said
it employs more than 25,000 people globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
