Sherutei Bar Grains Import Ltd., an
Israeli importer, is seeking 85,000 metric tons of corn and
50,000 tons of feed wheat, according to two people familiar with
the tender.  The company is also seeking 20,000 tons of barley, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the tender hasnâ€™t
been publicly announced. The bids are due by June 27 and the
grains are for delivery from August through October, depending
on the origin, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
