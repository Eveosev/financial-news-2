Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a cargo from Trinidad & Tobago, according to ship-tracking data.  The Methane Spirit, with a capacity of about 163,000 cubic
meters, will arrive today at the port of Bahia Blanca southwest
of Buenos Aires, according to ship transmissions captured by IHS
Fairplay on Bloomberg. The vessel docked at Atlantic LNG Co.’s
Point Fortin terminal to load the supercooled gas and departed
May 28, the data show.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, the country’s largest
energy company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as
Enarsa. YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes
for delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven
spot tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
