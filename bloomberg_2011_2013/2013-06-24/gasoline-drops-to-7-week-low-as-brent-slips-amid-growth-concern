Gasoline sank to a seven-week low as
 Brent crude  weakened and amid concern economic growth in the
U.S. and  China  may slow. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures slipped as Brent crude dropped below $100 and its
premium to the U.S. benchmark oil narrowed, making processing
oil priced off Brent less expensive. Goldman Sachs Group cut
China’s growth forecast. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  indicated last week the central bank may begin tapering
its bond buying this year and end it in 2014.  “Brent has finally given it up,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “Then there’s
the situation in China and Goldman Sachs lowering their growth
estimates. What could turn the market around is if the Feds ease
concerns about tapering.”  July-delivery gasoline fell 1.53 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.7464 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, after sliding 4.7 percent last week. Volume was 21
percent below the 100-day average at 3:17 p.m.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus August West Texas
Intermediate narrowed 97 cents to 20.70 a barrel. The fuel’s
 premium  over Brent fell 42 cents to $14.03.  Brent oil for August delivery fell 71 cents to $100.20 and
touched $99.82. Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed 38 cents to $6.84.  “The oil markets continue under pressure, Brent
especially, due to the weakness in Chinese manufacturing,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.6 cent
to $3.567 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on
its website. Prices have retreated since June 12 and are the
lowest since May 9.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for July delivery  gained 0.37 cent
to $2.8478 a gallon on trading volume that was 15 percent above
the 100-day average. Prices fell 4 percent last week.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI was unchanged at $25.73 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  was 55 cents higher at $19.06.  To contact the reporter on this story:
