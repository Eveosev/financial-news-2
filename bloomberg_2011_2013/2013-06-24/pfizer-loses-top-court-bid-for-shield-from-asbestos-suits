The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
shield  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  from some asbestos lawsuits connected to its
Quigley Co. subsidiary, a bankrupt unit that stopped most
operations in 1992.  The justices today rejected Pfizer’s appeal of a ruling
that opened the New York-based drugmaker to some claims related
to Quigley, which made asbestos-containing products for the
 steel industry  from the 1940s to the 1970s. Pfizer acquired
Quigley in 1968. Asbestos, once widely used an insulator, was
later shown to cause cancer.  Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, contended that
Quigley’s bankruptcy proceedings insulated the parent company
from suits filed under Pennsylvania state law by the Baltimore
law firm of Peter Angelos.  The firm began suing Pfizer in Pennsylvania state courts in
1999, saying the company was legally responsible for some claims
because its logo appeared on Quigley products.  Pfizer says it played no role in making or selling the
Quigley products. A federal appeals court in New York said the
claims against Pfizer could go forward.  The Obama administration urged the high court to reject
Pfizer’s appeal.  The bankruptcy case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
Supreme Court case is Pfizer v. Law Offices of Peter Angelos,
12-300.  To contact the reporter on this story:
