U.S. property-casualty insurers
posted their first quarterly underwriting profit since 2009
after companies raised prices to cushion against low interest
rates and costs from natural disasters.  The underwriting profit, which measures premium revenue
minus expenses and claims costs, was $4.64 billion in the three
months ended March 31, compared with a loss of $144 million a
year earlier, according to a  statement  today from the Property
Casualty Insurers Association of America and  Verisk Analytics
Inc. (VRSK) ’s ISO unit.  Insurers have relied in recent years on investments to
remain profitable, a strategy that was hindered when near
record-low interest rates pressured income from bonds held to
back policyholder obligations. The industry, which counts
Allstate Corp. and  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  among its
largest publicly traded companies, has had an underwriting loss
in 92 of the last 109 quarters, according to the statement.  The reversal in the first three months of this year is
“especially welcome given the toll that long-term declines in
interest rates and investment leverage have taken,” Michael R. Murray, assistant vice president for financial analysis at ISO,
said in the statement-.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Property & Casualty Insurance
Index advanced 17 percent in the three months ended March 31,
the best period since the third quarter of 2009. The benchmark
climbed about 1.8 percent since the end of last quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
