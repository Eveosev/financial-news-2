China  terminated Jose Antonio Camacho’s contract as national soccer coach, the official Xinhua
News Agency said, after the team lost all three of its home
games in June.  Camacho, a 58-year-old Spaniard, was hired on a three-year
contract in August 2011 and failed to guide the team to next
year’s World Cup in  Brazil . Calls to the China Football
Association’s Beijing office seeking comment went unanswered.  Under Camacho, a former player and coach for Spain’s
national team, China slumped to its lowest  FIFA World Ranking  of
109 in March 2013. It’s currently ranked 95th in the world.  China lost to Uzbekistan and the Netherlands this month
before slumping to a 5-1 defeat against Thailand’s team of
under-21 players on June 15 in Hefei.  South Korea  appointed former national team captain Hong Myung-Bo as coach today on a two-year contract, the Korea
Football Association said on its website.  Hong, 44, replaces Choi Kang-Hee, who quit last week after
South Korea secured its eighth straight  World Cup  appearance on
goal difference from Uzbekistan.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
