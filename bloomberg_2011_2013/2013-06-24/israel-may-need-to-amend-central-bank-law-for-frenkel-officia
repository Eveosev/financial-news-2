Israel  may have to change the law
governing the central bank to allow Jacob Frenkel to serve a
third term as its chief, an Israeli official said today.  According to the Bank of Israel Law, approved in 2010,
governors may serve a maximum of two terms. Frenkel, who was
nominated by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, served as
governor from 1991 to 2000.  It appears that it will be necessary to change the law for
Frenkel and the government is aware of that, the official said,
speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the matter.  Frenkel, 70, chairman of  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  International, was
nominated yesterday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The
post of governor unexpectedly opened in January when  Stanley Fischer , 69, announced he would leave at the end of June, midway
through his second five-year term.  To contact the reporters on this story:
