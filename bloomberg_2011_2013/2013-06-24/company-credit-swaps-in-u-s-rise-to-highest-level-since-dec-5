A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk rose for a fourth day to a more than six-month high as
Chinese equities entered a  bear market  on concern that a cash
crunch will injure the economy.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
5.7 basis points to a mid-price of 99.7 basis points at 8:28
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.
Earlier the index reached 99.8 basis points, the highest
intraday level since Dec. 5.  Confidence in corporate credit has fallen since Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week the central bank
may begin dialing back its $85 billion in bond purchases if the
economy improves as the Fed forecasts.  China â€™s central bank
refrained from using open-market operations to stem a cash
crunch as the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 20
percent earlier this month from a recent peak.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
