Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)  Chief Financial
Officer George Quinn said the world’s second-biggest reinsurer
is seeking to bolster its primary insurance unit through
acquisitions in countries such as China, India and  Brazil .  “We’d be looking to add either the geographical or the
product expertise in some areas, typically bolt-on type
transactions,” Quinn, 46, said in a telephone interview today.
The Zurich-based firm is targeting faster-growing markets for
reinsurance and its primary business called Corporate Solutions.  Swiss Re said today it plans to cut costs and repurchase
debt to boost profitability and increase its dividend. The
company forecast cost savings of as much as $300 million by 2015
and will cut leverage by more than $4 billion by 2016.  “Generally, we’d like to allocate more capital to the
high-growth markets,” said Quinn. “There will be a preference
for acquisitions that can increase Corporate Solutions’s
exposure to those particular areas of the world.”  Quinn said Swiss Re has not set limits on how much it could
spend on acquisitions for its Corporate Solutions unit.  In reinsurance, “it is completely conceivable that we
would invest directly in the client” by taking a share of the
equity of a primary insurer, the CFO said. Swiss Re last year
invested in a Chinese property and casualty insurer, he said.  “We have a pipeline that we continually evaluate for
potential further investments,” he said. “The amounts of money
invested so far have been between $10 million and $50 million,
so not incredibly high, and larger is possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
