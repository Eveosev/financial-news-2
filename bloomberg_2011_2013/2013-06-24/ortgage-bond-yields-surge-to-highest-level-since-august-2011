Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac
mortgage bonds that guide U.S. home-loan rates extended
increases sparked by a potential slowing of the  Federal
Reserve ’s debt purchases.  Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year securities climbed 0.2
percentage point to 3.6 percent at 10:27 a.m. in New York, the
highest level since August 2011, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The yields have risen from a record-low of 1.68
percent reached Sept. 26, after the Fed announced it would start
buying $40 billion of government-backed housing debt a month,
embarking on its third round of so-called quantitative easing to
spur growth.  Bonds are tumbling worldwide as the central bank moves
closer to scaling back its $85 billion in monthly debt buying,
which includes $45 billion of Treasuries. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 at a news conference following a statement
by the  Federal Open Market Committee  that the central bank may
“moderate” the pace later this year and end the purchases
around the middle of 2014 if the economy continues to improve as
it forecasts.  “With investors generally expecting Bernanke to calm
recent volatility, the Fed statement,” surprised markets,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Matt Jozoff in New York
said in a report last week. “A continued sell-off is clearly
the main threat to the mortgage market right now.”  The average cost of new 30-year, fixed-rate home loans
climbed to 4.36 percent on June 21, from a record low 3.36
percent in December, according to Bankrate.com  data .  A measure of spreads on the Fannie Mae current coupon debt,
or bonds trading closest to face value, rose to the highest
since April 2012. Relative yields on the securities climbed
about 0.08 percentage point to 1.54 percentage point higher than
an average of five- and 10-year Treasury rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
