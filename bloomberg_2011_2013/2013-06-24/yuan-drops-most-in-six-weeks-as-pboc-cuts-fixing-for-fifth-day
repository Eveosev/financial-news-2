China’s  yuan  fell the most in six
weeks as the central bank lowered the currency’s reference rate
for a fifth day, the longest run of cuts this year.  The People’s Bank of China reduced the  fixing  0.07 percent
to 6.1807 per dollar, the lowest since May 30. The onshore spot
rate is allowed to diverge from the reference by a maximum of 1
percent. The Dollar Index rose 0.4 percent, taking its four-day
gain to 2.5 percent, the biggest since November 2011, after the
 Federal Reserve  indicated last week it may begin winding down
bond purchases that spurred flows to  emerging markets . The PBOC
said yesterday it’ll keep the yuan exchange rate basically
stable at a reasonable, balanced level.  The yuan declined 0.18 percent to close at 6.1451 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to China Foreign Exchange Trade
System prices. That’s the biggest drop since May 10. The
currency has strengthened 1.4 percent this year, the sole gainer
among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There’s been stronger dollar demand on concerns the U.S.
will taper stimulus and as China’s growth is slowing,” said
Stella Lee, president of Success Wealth Management Ltd. in  Hong
Kong . “Yuan appreciation is likely to take a pause for now.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 the central bank
could taper its $85 billion of monthly bond purchases this year
and end the program in 2014 if the  U.S. economy  improves in line
with its projections.  China International Capital Corp. cut its 2013 forecast for
expansion in Asia’s biggest economy to 7.4 percent from 7.7
percent, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its projection
to 7.4 percent from 7.8 percent. Growth held below 8 percent for
each of the last four quarters, the first time that has happened
in at least 20 years, official data show.  Offshore Market  The  Bank of England  and the People’s Bank of China signed a
three-year currency swap line of 200 billion yuan ($33 billion),
according to a statement published by the U.K. central bank on
June 22. China may allow basic yuan capital account
convertibility by 2015, Shanghai Securities News reported today,
citing Zhang Chenghui, head of the finance institute under the
State Council’s Development Research Center.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan fell 0.18 percent
to 6.1422 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slid 0.33 percent to
6.3180, a 2.7 percent  discount  to the onshore spot.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, increased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.94 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
