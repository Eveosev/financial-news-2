French President Francois Hollande’s
approval rating dropped to a new low, suggesting a recovery in
May was just a blip, a poll by  BVA Opinion  showed.  About 31 percent of voters have a “good opinion” of the
Socialist president, down from 61 percent just after his
election a year ago and from 35 percent in May, BVA said in a
survey for L’Express magazine and Radio  France .  The decline comes as France’s economy remains stuck in
recession and jobless claims are at their highest on record.
None of Hollande’s predecessors showed such low ratings just
one-year into their terms.  The three most popular politicians in France are Justice
Minister Christiane Taubira, Interior Minister Manuel Valls and
Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg, BVA said.  BVA surveyed 1,060 voters June 19 and 20. The poll’s margin
of error is about 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
