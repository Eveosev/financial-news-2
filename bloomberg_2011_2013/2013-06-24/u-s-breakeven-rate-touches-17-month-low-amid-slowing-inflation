Treasury 30-year bonds snapped a
three-day losing streak as the highest yields since 2011 fueled
demand and Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard
Fisher  said investors shouldn’t overreact to the central bank’s
plan to slow bond purchases.  U.S.  10-year (USGG10YR)  notes pared losses as volatility surged.
Treasuries slid earlier as government debt from  Australia  to
 Germany  fell on bets a cut in accommodation from the Fed will
lead to an eventual end of record low central-bank  interest
rates . Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June 19 U.S. policy
makers may begin tapering their quantitative-easing program this
year and end it in mid-2014. The Treasury will sell $99 billion
in notes this week.  “Fisher helped to stabilize the market a little bit,”
said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at
Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “Most people think Treasuries are
oversold. The stabilizing comments from Fisher brought some
people to feel comfortable buying the market.”  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.55 percent at 5 p.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. They increased seven
basis points earlier to 3.65 percent, the highest since Sept. 1,
2011. They rose 28 basis points last week, the most since August
2009. The price of the 2.875 percent securities due in May 2043
gained 18/32, or $5.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 87 21/32.  The 10-year note yield was little changed at  2.54 percent.
It climbed 13 basis points to 2.66 percent, the highest since
August 2011, and fell two basis points to 2.51 percent. The
yield rose 40 basis points last week, the most in 10 years.  Relative Strength  A technical gauge signaled U.S. government securities might
be poised to end their slide. The 14-day relative-strength
index, a monitor of momentum, was 77.6 for the  10-year (USGG5YR)  note and
69.2 for the 30-year bond. A level above 70 suggests the yield
may change direction.  Fisher, who has been among the most vocal critics within
the Fed of its unprecedented measures to bolster the economy,
said central-bank policy remains accommodative.  “What we’re talking about here is dialing back,” Fisher,
who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said in  London .
“The word ‘exit’ is not appropriate here.”  Fisher said he favors scaling back the Fed’s monthly bond
purchases if the economy makes the kind of progress officials
currently expect. Policy makers raised their growth forecasts
for next year to a range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent and reduced
their outlook for unemployment to as low as 6.5 percent.  Clearer Guideposts  Fed Bank of Minneapolis President  Narayana Kocherlakota ,
who has called for easier policy, said the Fed must emphasize in
its statement that it will remain accommodative “for a
considerable time” after the end of quantitative easing.
Kocherlakota, who also doesn’t vote this year, spoke in a
conference call with reporters.  The Fed needs to set clearer guideposts for the outlook for
record stimulus, Kocherlakota said in an earlier statement.  Volatility in Treasuries, as measured by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, climbed to 110.98, according to the
latest available data, the highest since Nov. 17, 2011. It has
averaged 62 this year.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 8 percent to $545
billion. The 2013 average is $312 billion.  The real yield, the difference in U.S. 10-year note yields
and the annual inflation rate, widened to 1.19 percentage
points, the most since March 2011, exceeding the 1.13
percentage-point average of the past decade.  ‘Roiling Everyone’  “The confusion in the marketplace is roiling everyone,”
said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP
Paribas SA, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The change in real yield is alarming. When real yields rise
this fast, the actual impact is much more severe than a nominal
yield rise. The market believes debt has become more onerous in
a real sense.”  Treasuries fell 2.8 percent this year through June 21,
according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury  Bond Index. (BUSY)  The MSCI
All-Country World Index of shares returned 5 percent during the
period, including reinvested dividends, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  “Liquidity today is king, and what we’re getting is
cascading liquidity failures,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief
executive and co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment
Co., said today in a Bloomberg Radio interview with  Tom Keene 
and  Michael McKee . “When you change the liquidity paradigm,
what you get is massive technical unwinds, and that speaks to
the volatility.”  Fed Purchases  The Fed has been buying $40 billion of mortgage-backed
securities and $45 billion of U.S. government debt each month to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs in its third round of
the quantitative-easing program.  The central bank will cut its monthly bond purchases to $65
billion at its Sept. 17-18 policy meeting, according to 44
percent of 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg after Bernanke’s
June 19 press conference. In a June 4-5 survey, only 27 percent
forecast tapering would start in September.  The Fed lowered its  forecasts  on June 19 for the core
personal-consumption-expenditure price index, its preferred
measure of inflation, for this year and the coming two years,
saying it won’t reach 2 percent at least until 2015. Bernanke
said the same day that reducing bond purchases would depend on
the economy achieving the central bank’s objectives.  Break-Even  The  gap  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities touched 1.81
percentage points, the narrowest since October 2011, before
trading at 1.92. The  break-even  rate signals the bond market’s
expectations for the rate of growth in consumer prices during
the life of the debt.  The difference between yields on 10- and 30-year Treasuries
touched 0.97 percentage point, the narrowest since January 2012.  The U.S. is scheduled to auction $35 billion of two-year
notes tomorrow, the same amount of five-year debt the next day
and $29 billion of seven-year securities on June 27.  Germany (GDBR10) ’s 10-year bund yield increased as much as 13 basis
points to 1.85 percent, the highest since April 4, 2012. The
yield on Australia’s 10-year government bond surged 28 basis
points, the biggest jump since January 2009, to close at 4.03
percent in Sydney after reaching 4.04 percent, the highest since
April 2012.  Belgium ’s 10-year yield climbed 22 basis points to 2.85
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Portuguese debt
surged 37 basis points to 6.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
