U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman  Patrick Leahy  said he’s proposing legislation meant to
limit the reach of federal surveillance programs.  The legislation follows the disclosure by former federal
security contractor Edward Snowden of extensive data collection
and analysis programs set up to combat terrorism.  Leahy said that his bill would increase the threshold for
obtaining records under the Patriot Act and would require law
enforcement to prove that any foreign intelligence information
sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.  Government surveillance powers “deserve close scrutiny by
Congress,” the Vermont Democrat, said in a statement. “The
comprehensive legislation that I am introducing today will not
only improve the privacy protections and accountability
provisions associated with these authorities, but also
strengthen oversight and transparency provisions in other parts
of the USA Patriot Act.”  The bill would expand public disclosure about federal
information-gathering requests known as national security
letters.  The bill is co-sponsored by Utah Republican  Mike Lee ,
Colorado Democrat Mark Udall, Oregon Democrat  Ron Wyden ,
Connecticut Democrat  Richard Blumenthal  and Montana Democrat Jon Tester.  “This legislation will narrow surveillance authorities
where appropriate and help provide the necessary accountability
to ensure that Americans’ constitutional rights are respected,”
Lee said in a statement.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
