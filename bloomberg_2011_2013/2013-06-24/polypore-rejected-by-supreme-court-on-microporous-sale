The U.S. Supreme Court left intact a
Federal Trade Commission order requiring  Polypore International
Inc. (PPO) , a maker of battery components, to sell the Microporous
unit the company acquired in 2008.  The justices today turned away an appeal filed by
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based Polypore, leaving in place a
lower-court ruling backing the FTC. The consumer-protection
agency said the acquisition would reduce competition in the
market for battery separators, the microporous membranes that
prevent short circuits in lead-acid batteries.  Microporous accounted for 10 percent of Polypore’s 2012
sales, the company said in a regulatory filing in May. Polypore
said in that filing that the dispute “will not have a material
adverse impact on its business or financial condition.”  The case is Polypore v. Federal Trade Commission, 12-1016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
