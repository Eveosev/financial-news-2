Lionel Messi, the four-time world
soccer player of the year who’s being investigated for alleged
tax evasion, paid 10 million euros ($13.1 million) to correct
his tax situation for 2010 and 2011, La Vanguardia reported.  The payment to Spain’s tax authority could mean Messi is
seeking to settle the judicial probe he is involved in relating
to 2007, 2008 and 2009, the Barcelona-based newspaper said,
citing unidentified people familiar with the case.  Public prosecutor Raquel Amado filed a complaint June 12
that said Messi and his father had evaded 4.2 million euros of
taxes by routing income from endorsement deals with  Adidas AG (ADS) ,
 PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) ,  Danone SA (BN)  and his club,  Barcelona , through
companies in the U.K. and Switzerland to Uruguay.  Messi, a 26-year-old Argentine who’s played for  Barcelona 
since 2003, denied wrongdoing in a post on his Facebook page on
June 12 that said he had always fulfilled his tax obligations.  He and his father, Jorge Horacio, are scheduled to appear
in court near Barcelona on Sept. 17.  Messi was soccer’s best-paid player after David Beckham
last year with 35 million euros of salary and endorsements,
according to a list compiled France Football magazine in March.
Beckham, 38, quit pro soccer in May.  Luis Gonzalez, a spokesman for Spain’s tax authority, said
he was unable to comment on individual cases. Pablo Negre,
commercial director of Leo Messi Management, didn’t immediately
return a call and e-mail seeking comment on the newspaper
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
