Public companies are taking
advantage of  record U.S. equity prices  to sell the most stock in
17 years, even as initial offerings slow.  Thermo Fisher  Scientific Inc., Dollar General Corp. and HCA
Holdings Inc. are among U.S. corporations that offered $78
billion in shares during 2013, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. They’ve completed 334 secondary offerings, the most
since 1996. IPOs are down 31 percent to $19.9 billion, the
lowest since 2010, the data show.  Bears say the increase is the result of distortions caused
by Federal Reserve  stimulus  and shows that private-equity firms
and chief executive officers see little chance that prices will
go much higher. Bulls say the IPO slowdown means markets haven’t
become too frothy. Secondary offerings last peaked in 1996 and
2004, right in the middle of multi-year rallies as economic
growth accelerated, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Stocks are going to get overvalued as rates rise, so the
smart money starts to sell now, which is why you see private
equity selling shares, insiders selling shares and companies
selling shares,”  Malcolm Polley , who manages $1.1 billion as
chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors LLC in
 Indiana ,  Pennsylvania , said in a June 20 phone interview. “If
you are an investor, you end up thinking, if the smart money is
selling, should I really be buying?”  Global Selloff  U.S. stocks tumbled the most since 2011 on June 19 and 20
after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank may
slow its bond-buying program in 2014 if the economy achieves
criteria set by policy makers. More than $4.4 trillion of global
share value has been erased since May 21 as Bernanke raised the
prospect of tapering. That compares with the $30 trillion
created in the last four years.  The MSCI All-Country World Index slipped the most in 21
months, including a 4 percent decline for  emerging markets  on
June 20.  Yields (USGG10YR)  on 10-year Treasuries surged to 2.5 percent on
June 21, the highest since August 2011.  Companies sold stock this year as the S&P 500 rose  as much
as 17 percent  to a record 1,669.16 on May 21, the best start
since 1974. About half of the offerings involved private equity
firms or other stakeholders, Bloomberg data show. The S&P 500
fell 1.2 percent to 1,573.09 at 4 p.m.  New York  time today.  HCA Holdings (HCA)  announced a $1.8 billion sale by KKR & Co. and
Bain Capital LLC earlier this year. Existing shareholders sold
$1.75 billion of Dollar General stock.  Thermo Fisher (TMO) ’s $2.53
billion sale this month will be used to fund its Life
Technologies Corp. acquisition.  Pricing IPOs  Coty Inc., the maker of perfumes by Beyonce Knowles and
Heidi Klum, and  SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. (SEAS) , the theme park
operator, are among 78 companies that have priced IPOs in 2013.
The $19.9 billion raised compares with almost $30 billion at
this point in 2012 and 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The 78 deals this year compare with an average of 146
for the last two decades.  Companies that have completed IPOs this year have rallied
about 22.4 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. New shares
gained an average of 42 percent in the six months after their
offerings last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Additional share sales have come as the advance enters its
fifth year and  price-earnings ratios  for S&P 500 companies
climbed above the six-decade average of 16 last month. With the
bull market matching the average duration of past rallies since
1945, companies may be trying to raise money before it fizzles,
said Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New
Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc., which manages
about $85 billion.  ‘Topping Out’  “They’re thinking, we might be topping out here, and
prices of their companies are at or close to all-time highs,”
Garcia, head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based
Thornburg, which manages about $85 billion, said in a June 20
phone interview. “If you’re going to do it, you want to do it
while the market’s hot.”  Share sales are increasing this year because firms have
been waiting for valuations to come back to  normal , according to
Joe Castle, the New York-based head of global equities syndicate
at Barclays Plc.  The S&P 500 traded at an average of 9.8 percent below its
five-decade average price-earnings ratio for the last two years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Valuations increased as
analysts boosted profit predictions for 2014 and 2015 and
economists forecast gross domestic product will accelerate next
year.  Economic Recovery  The U.S. economy has expanded every quarter since the
middle of 2009, recovering from the worst recession in seven
decades. Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. climbed
last month to the highest level in more than three years.
Manufacturing expanded in June, reports last week showed. While
the unemployment rate at 7.6 percent remains above the five-decade average of 5.8 percent, it’s  down  from a 26-year high of
10 percent reached in October 2009.  “As the market has rallied, volatility has remained low
and we’ve reached a point now where companies are more open to
using equity for acquisitions or to fund growth,” Castle said
in a June 19 phone interview. “A stronger economy is going to
be good for stocks and earnings. We’re at a very good spot on
the equity issuance cycle.”  Past peaks in secondary offerings came during equity market
rallies. In  1996 (SPX) , after the S&P 500 had more than doubled since
October 1990, 341 companies sold more shares, the most for the
first half of a year since at least 1970, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The advance became the biggest bull
market on record, lasting 10 years and producing a 417 percent
return, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘More Confident’  More than 260 public corporations sold stock in 2004 as the
economy expanded 3.5 percent. The S&P 500 was in the second year
of a 102 percent advance that went on for five years and pushed
the benchmark gauge to a record 1,565.15 by October 2007.  “I don’t think anyone should read into this as an overall
negative sentiment about the market,” Bob McCooey, senior vice
president for Nasdaq OMX Group Inc., who oversees relationship
management for listed companies, said by phone June 19. “The
markets have done well and people have gotten more confident in
the turnaround of the economy, so they are willing to pay higher
prices for assets.”  Shares of companies that sold additional shares this year
have declined a median of 4.6 percent since announcing the
offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ArcelorMittal (MT)  is down
31 percent since the world’s biggest steelmaker said in January
it would raise $3.5 billion in equity and convertible notes to
pay down debt. Williams Partners LP dropped 3.3 percent since a
more than $600 million offer on March 4.  Private Equity  Private-equity firms, seeking commitments for new
investment funds, are selling to provide returns to current
limited partners, according to Frank Maturo, New York-based vice
chairman of equity capital markets at Bank of America Corp. Many
of the companies offering shares were taken private during
history’s biggest leveraged buyout boom, when about $1.6
trillion of deals were completed from 2005 to 2007, according to
Preqin Ltd., a London-based research firm.  “Many financial sponsors are fundraising and want to show
returns to their investors, but in addition, given some macro
uncertainty and volatility, they also feel valuations are
attractive to monetize some of their position,” Maturo said in
a briefing on June 20.  Higher Valuations  The price-earnings ratio for HCA, the largest for-profit
U.S. hospital chain, reached 22 by the end of 2012, about a
month and a half before it announced a group of existing
investors were selling 50 million shares. That compares with
11.9 when the stock made its debut in March 2011, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. HCA has  underperformed  a group of S&P 500
health stocks by 8 percentage points since the sale.  TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. rallied twice as much as the
S&P 500 in the 12 months before announcing a 10 million share
offering Feb. 20. The gains sent the biggest vehicle-safety
equipment maker’s valuation to a two-year high. Shares have
underperformed the S&P 500 by 1.9 percentage points since then.  Since announcing March 27 that 30 million shares would be
sold, Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based  Dollar General (DG)  fell 1.5
percent, compared to the S&P 500’s 1.9 percent increase. Cobalt
International, the oil explorer in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  and
West Africa,  fell  the most in more than four months May 8, when
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Carlyle Group LP and other backers
sold 50 million shares at a discount to the previous day’s
price. The stock fell 3.4 percent since then.  Slowing Buybacks  Thermo Fisher, the second-biggest maker of life-science
equipment by market value, announced the $2.53 billion sale in
additional shares this month. Even though the Waltham,
Massachusetts-based company is using the proceeds to buy Life
Technologies, a maker of DNA-sequencing equipment and laboratory
materials, the stock has fallen 3.6 percent, 2.5 percentage
points more than the S&P 500, since the June 5 announcement.  At the same time companies are issuing more stock, they are
slowing the pace of repurchases, which surged during the early
parts of the bull market. So far this quarter, 206 companies
announced buyback plans, the fewest since the three months
ending June 2010, and about 18 percent less than last year’s
average, according to data from Birinyi Associates Inc., in
Westport,  Connecticut .  Insiders are also cutting holdings. Corporate officers and
directors sold $7.7 billion in May, the most since May 2011,
according to corporate filings compiled by TrimTabs Investment
Research Inc.  “The market got frothy,”  Peter Sorrentino , who helps
manage about $14.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati, said in a June 21 phone interview. “Better to exit
now than wait for the disappointment to hit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
