Segro Plc (SGRO) , the U.K.’s largest
publicly traded owner of industrial properties, is in talks to
use most of its warehouses in mainland  Europe  to form a venture
with  Canada ’s Public Sector Pension Investment Board.  Segro would own 50 percent of the venture and manage its
assets, the Slough, England-based company said in a statement
today.  “The intention would be to grow the venture over time,”
Segro said.  Segro wants to increase the value of its logistics business
to 3 billion pounds ($4.6 billion), with mainland Europe
accounting for about two thirds of the total, the Sunday Times
reported yesterday. Europe needs 25 million square meters (296
million square feet) of new distribution and storage warehouses
in the next five years, about 11 percent of existing modern
space, to keep up with Internet sales growth, Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
