Albania’s two biggest political
parties both claimed victory after the weekend parliamentary
elections, amid conflicting exit polls and scattered violence
that left one person dead.  Premier Sali Berisha’s Democrats won 42 percent of votes
cast against 40 percent for the opposition Socialists led by Edi Rama,  AlbPress   news agency  reported, citing an exit poll carried
out by Tirana-based  Civitas Albania . A separate exit poll by
Italy’s  IPR Marketing  showed Rama ahead by 12 points at between
51.5 percent and 55.5 percent. A Socialist activist was shot
dead in the northern town of Lac yesterday, the news agency
said.  “The election was always expected to be closely fought,
and the results contested, as political patronage is huge in
Albania,” Timothy Ash, chief emerging-markets economist at
Standard Bank Plc, said in a note to clients. “Both parties are
pro-EU, but a question will be how long instability lasts.”  A victory for Rama, former major of Tirana, the capital,
would end Berisha’s eight year-long premiership. The state
commission, whose preliminary results indicated the opposition
won twice as many votes in the capital city than Berisha’s
coalition, is expected to release a near-complete national count
later today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
