Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Bank of New York
Mellon Corp. are the two U.S. banks likely to have the largest
capital shortfall if regulators double the so-called  leverage
ratio  without exempting cash and government bonds, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note today.  Morgan Stanley’s Tier 1 leverage ratio is about 4.5 percent
and Bank of New York’s 3.9 percent, the farthest behind the 6
percent requirement said to be under consideration, Goldman
Sachs analysts led by  Richard Ramsden  said today in a note. The
average Tier 1 leverage ratio for large banks is 5.5 percent,
the analysts said.  U.S. regulators are considering doubling the amount of
capital the largest banks must hold to 6 percent of total
assets, four people with knowledge of the talks said last week.
Last year, rulemakers proposed implementing a 3 percent
international requirement for what’s known as the simple
leverage ratio.  “Bank of New York and Morgan Stanley screen as outliers as
outsized cash/repo books meaningfully inflate their asset
bases,” the analysts wrote. Both companies are based in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
