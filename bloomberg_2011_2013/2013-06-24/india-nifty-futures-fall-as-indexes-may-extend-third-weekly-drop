Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures dropped,
signaling benchmark indexes will extend a three-week slide.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery fell 0.6
percent to 5,619.50 at 10:11 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
rose 0.2 percent to 5,667.65 on June 21. The S&P BSE Sensex
gained 0.3 percent to 18,774.24. The Bank of  New York  Mellon
India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares rose 1.2 percent to 944.68.  The Sensex sank 2.1 percent last week, a third week of
declines, as overseas funds sold the most Indian equities in
almost two years on June 20. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week bond buying that fueled gains in markets
globally may be pared this year should risks to the  U.S. economy 
continue to ebb. India’s rupee plunged to a record low on June
20 and completed its biggest weekly loss since September 2011.  “Withdrawal of funds by overseas investors and consequent
weakening of the rupee is keeping stocks under pressure,”
Rajendra Wadher, director at PRB Securities Ltd., said by phone
yesterday. “Liquidity flows are likely to taper down over a
period of time and improvement in macros is needed to improve
the corporate earnings outlook. Valuations are looking
attractive from a long term investment view.”  The Sensex trades at 12.8 times  projected 12-month profits ,
a two-month low, compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s
9.4 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Foreigners pulled a net $358 million from domestic shares
on June 20, the highest since Aug. 9, 2011, data released by the
regulator show. The sales extend withdrawals from stocks in June
to $760 million, putting funds on course to end 12 months of net
buying, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That reduced this
year’s net purchases to $14.3 billion, still a record for the
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Foreigners have been net sellers in only two of the past 13
years, based on data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 2000.  “Markets are getting sold as if there’s no tomorrow,
Rajesh Cheruvu, chief investment officer at RBS Private Banking
 India , said in a phone interview. “This weakness is likely to
continue for at least one or two weeks more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
