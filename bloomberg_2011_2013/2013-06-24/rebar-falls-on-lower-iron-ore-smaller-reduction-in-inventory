Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 China  fell after a decline in iron ore prices and as inventory
shrank at the slowest rate in 10 weeks.  Rebar for delivery in October on the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange fell as much as 1.6 percent to 3,457 yuan ($563) a
metric ton, before trading at 3,458 yuan at 10:33 a.m. local
time. Futures jumped 2.7 percent last week.  Iron ore prices for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in
China fell 1.7 percent on June 21 to $118.60 a dry ton, the
first decline in 10 days, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
 Rebar inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell by 0.2 percent in the week ended June 14,
the slowest rate of reduction since April 5.  “Seasonal demand is showing signs of weakness as traders
and end users are drawing down inventory at a much slower pace
now,” Dang Man, analyst at Maike Futures Co., said by phone
from Xian today. “Rebar is under pressure also due to a lack of
clear policy initiative in boosting demand for the building
material.”  The average  spot price  for rebar in China was little
changed at 3,390  yuan  a ton on June 21, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
