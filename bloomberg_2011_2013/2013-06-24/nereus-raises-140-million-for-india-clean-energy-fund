(Corrects figure in first paragraph to $100 million,
clarifies that $40 million is part of $100 million in second
paragraph.)  Nereus Capital Management LLC said
it raised as much as $100 million from Northern Lights Capital
Group LLC and the U.S. Agency for International Development for
its  India  clean energy fund.  Northern Lights will contribute $100 million to Nereus
Capital’s India Alternative Energy Fund, which includes a $40
million credit guarantee from USAID, Nereus Managing Director
Jonathan Winer said in an e-mail.  The money will be used in the construction of as much as
400 megawatts of clean-energy capacity in India, according to a
joint statement by Northern Lights and the U.S. agency.
Potential investments include wind, hydropower and solar
utilities, as well as large-scale energy efficiency projects.  India targets doubling renewable-energy capacity to about
60,000 megawatts by 2017 to help reduce blackouts and diversify
generation away from fossil fuel-based power plants struggling
with fuel shortages. Private equity-funded Indian wind and solar
developers include Morgan Stanley’s Continuum Wind Energy Pte
Ltd. and Kiran Energy Solar Power Pvt. backed by Bessemer
Venture Partners, an early funder of Skype Technologies SA.  Nereus received $20 million last year from the
International Finance Corp., the World Bank’s private financing
arm, as part of a plan to raise $250 million. Winer declined to
disclose the fund’s existing portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
