Senegal  is planning to sell a second
Eurobond worth $500 million, according to the  International
Monetary Fund , joining Ghana,  Nigeria  and Rwanda as African
nations tapping foreign debt markets in 2013.  The country’s authorities “are well advanced in the
process of hiring financial and legal advisers and expect to
issue the new bond early this fall,” the IMF said in a document
published on its website today that partly cites a June 4 staff
report. The duration will match Senegal’s sale in 2011 of 10-year notes.  Sub-Saharan African nations, where growth is projected by
the IMF to be the second-fastest in the world this year after
emerging  Asia , are taking advantage of investor interest in the
frontier markets after yields retreated to record lows.
Borrowing costs on Senegal’s first debt of $500 million, sold in
May 2011, rose 80 basis points, or 0.8 percentage point, to
8.688 percent by 6:21 p.m. in Dakar.  “Current markets conditions seem indeed favorable,” the
IMF said, citing yields below 6 percent where the rate was in
late May. African borrowing costs jumped last week after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank may
reduce monetary stimulus that pushed cheap money into U.S.
markets, some of which was spent on assets from emerging
nations.  Ghana and Nigeria are planning second international bond
sales, worth $1 billion each, this year and Rwanda sold a debut
$400 million Eurobond in April. Kenya is planning its first sale
by September to fund infrastructure projects.  Senegal began selling 50 billion  CFA francs  ($99 million)
of 10-year bonds on June 21 to fund roads, bridges and energy
projects, Finance Minister Amadou Kane told reporters in Dakar.
The offer is open until July 22, according to a  website 
promoting the debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
