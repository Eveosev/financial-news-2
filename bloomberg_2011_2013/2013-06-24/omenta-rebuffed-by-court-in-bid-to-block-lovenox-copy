The U.S. Supreme Court turned away
an effort by Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. and  Novartis AG (NOVN) â€™s
Sandoz to halt sales of a competing generic version of the
blood-thinner Lovenox.  The high court today declined to hear their appeal of a
ruling that let  Actavis Inc. (ACT)  and Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc.
sell the copycat medicine while a patent-infringement case is
pending in federal court. The patent covers a way to analyze the
drug during the manufacture process to ensure it follows certain
quality controls required by regulators.  A lower-court decision limited the right of patent owners
to claim infringement of processes needed to maintain approval
of generic medicines by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
It expanded the scope of a federal law that prohibits
infringement suits over actions taken to gain FDA approval.  The Supreme Court case is  Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. (MNTA)  v.
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc., 12-1033.  The appeals court case is Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc., 12-1062, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit ( Washington ). The lower court case is
Momenta Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Amphastar Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
11cv11681, U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts 
(Boston).  To contact the reporter on this story:
