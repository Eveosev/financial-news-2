U.K. government bonds fell, with 10-year yields climbing to the highest level since October 2011, as
government securities slid around the world amid speculation the
Federal Reserve is moving closer to reducing debt purchases.  Ten-year gilts dropped for a third day before the Debt
Management Office sells bonds maturing in 2068 via banks this
week. Benchmark U.K. yields jumped the most since January 2009
last week as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said on June 19 that
U.S. policy makers may begin to reduce monetary stimulus this
year and end it in mid-2014. The pound reached a two-week low
against the dollar.  “Undoubtedly the gilt move is related to the message from
the Fed last week,” Jason Simpson, a U.K. rates strategist at
Banco Santander SA in  London . “People are very worried that all
asset markets are selling off at the same time because stimulus
boosted the value of all asset classes, and if that’s coming to
an end then people think it’s natural for all asset classes to
start deflating.”  The U.K. 10-year gilt yield rose 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 2.54 percent at 4:40 p.m. in London after
climbing to 2.59 percent, the highest level since Oct. 31, 2011.
The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 fell 1.02, or 10.20
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 93.52.  The benchmark yield, which has risen 41 basis points in the
past three days, will increase to 3.10 percent by March 31,
Banco Santander’s Simpson said.  BOE Minutes  Minutes released on June 19 from this month’s Bank of
England meeting showed policy makers took note of rising global
bond yields and their impact on U.K. interest-rate expectations.
At its June 6 meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee voted 6-3
in favor of maintaining its 375 billion-pound asset-purchase
target unchanged.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.6 percent this year
through June 21, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds dropped 1.9 percent and Treasuries declined 2.8
percent, the indexes show.  The pound reached the weakest since June 5 against the
dollar as the U.S. currency strengthened versus most of its
major counterparts on the prospect of the Fed closer to ending
monetary stimulus that tends to devalue a currency.  “The Fed has laid out its cards and that’s washing through
markets,” said  Gavin Friend , a currency strategist at National
Australia Bank Ltd. in London. “In that environment, cable will
be biased to drifting lower,” he said, referring to the pound-dollar exchange rate. “There’s no reason we can’t go back to
$1.50 in the next couple of weeks.”  The pound was little changed at $1.5413 after falling to
$1.5344. The U.K. currency strengthened 0.1 percent to 85.04
pence per euro.  Sterling has strengthened 4.7 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 4.3
percent and the dollar climbed 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
