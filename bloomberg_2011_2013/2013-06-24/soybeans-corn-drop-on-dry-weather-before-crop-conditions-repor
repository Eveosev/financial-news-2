Corn fell for a third straight
session on speculation that hot weather is improving conditions
of newly planted crops in the U.S., the world’s largest grower
and exporter. Wheat also declined, while soybeans were
unchanged.  Temperatures this week in the Midwest will top 90 degrees
Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), aiding crop growth, Commodity Weather
Group said. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  rated 64 percent
of the  corn  and  soybean  crops in good or excellent condition as
of June 16, and an updated report today probably will show
improvements in the past week, said Dewey Strickler, the
president of Ag Watch Market Advisers.  “As long as it doesn’t get too warm, that’ll be good for”
both crops, Strickler said by telephone from Franklin,  Kentucky .
“Corn and beans are looking pretty good right now.”  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest, fell
1.8 percent to settle at $5.465 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The price last week gained 4.4 percent,
the first increase in three.  Wheat futures for September delivery declined 2.4 percent
to $6.8775 a bushel in Chicago, sliding for a third straight
session.  Prices are falling amid concern that a cash crunch in  China 
will curb economic growth and commodities demand. China’s
central bank has urged banks to control risks from credit
expansion, signaling no relief from the cash squeeze.  Soybean futures for November delivery were unchanged at
$12.735 a bushel in  Chicago , after dropping as much as 1.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
