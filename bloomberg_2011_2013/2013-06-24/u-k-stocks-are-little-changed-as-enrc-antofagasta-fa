U.K. stocks  declined, extending a
five-month low for the FTSE 100 Index, as mining companies
tumbled with metal prices amid concern that a cash crunch in
 China  will reduce demand.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  dropped 6.5 percent after copper sank
to its lowest price in almost three years. Rio Tinto Group lost
3.4 percent as the company abandoned the sale of its diamond
unit. Banks also retreated as bond yields climbed across Europe.  The benchmark FTSE 100 lost 87.07 points, or 1.4 percent,
to 6,029.1 at the close in  London , its lowest level since Jan.
2. The gauge fell 3.1 percent last week, extending its  selloff
since May 22  to more than 10 percent, after the Federal Reserve
indicated that it may start paring stimulus measures later this
year if the U.S. economy improves.  “China is perhaps central to investors’ thoughts,” said
Keith Bowman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in
London. “We have seen tightening in money markets over there,
but authorities seem happy to stand back to allow that to happen
to some degree.”  The FTSE All-Share Index lost 1.5 percent in London, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index fell 2.4 percent in Dublin. The volume of
shares changing hands in  FTSE 100 (UKX)  companies was 4.6 percent
greater than the average of the past 30 days.  Chinese Equities  Chinese stocks tumbled, entering  a bear market , after the
country’s central bank signaled it will maintain efforts to curb
speculative lending and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
growth forecasts for the economy in 2013 and 2014.  While money-market rates fell for a second day from all-time highs, the overnight repurchase rate of 6.47 percent was
more than double this year’s average of 3.09 percent, according
to a fixing compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  Vedanta Resources slumped 6.5 percent to 1,026 pence as
copper tumbled on the London Metal Exchange to its lowest price
since July 2010.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , the copper producer controlled
by Chile’s Luksic family, slid 3 percent to 813 pence and  Anglo
American Plc (AAL)  lost 4 percent to 1,297.5 pence.  Rio Tinto retreated 3.4 percent to 2,582 pence. The world’s
 second-largest mining company  said it will keep its diamond
assets after failing to find a buyer and deciding against an
initial public offering for the unit. Rio Tinto had sought to
sell the assets since March 2012.  Kazakhmys Plunges  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  tumbled 13 percent to 233.7 pence after the
founders of  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. (ENRC)  and the Kazakhstan
government offered to buy ENRC with cash and Kazakhmys shares in
a bid that values the company at 3.04 billion pounds ($4.7
billion). ENRC slid 1.4 percent to 213.8 pence.  HSBC contributed the most to a selloff by European banks as
treasuries slumped, pushing 10-year yields to the highest since
2011, as government bonds from the U.K. to Germany and Ireland
slid. HSBC, Europe’s biggest lender, lost 0.9 percent to 655.6
pence.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  slid 0.9 percent to 279.05 pence.  In Dublin,  Bank of Ireland (BKIR)  slipped 3.4 percent to 14.1 euro
cents and  Permanent TSB Group Holdings Plc (IPM)  tumbled 13 percent to
2.6 cents.  Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK) , which is owned by the state,
slid 1.5 percent to 6.5 cents.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  climbed 2.5 percent to 122 pence after
reporting that  revenue  rose 24 percent to $27.3 billion in the
12 months through March. The company cited higher margins and
volumes at its Vadinar refinery in India and its Stanlow
refinery in the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
