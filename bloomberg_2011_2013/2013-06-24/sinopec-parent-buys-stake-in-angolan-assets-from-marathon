China Petrochemical Corp., the
parent of Asia’s biggest refiner, bought a 10 percent stake in
an oil and gas field in Angola from U.S.-based  Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO)  for $1.52 billion.  The purchase brings China Petrochemical’s stake in Block 31
to 15 percent, the parent of  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. ,
or Sinopec, said in an e-mailed statement on June 21. China
Petrochemical bought a 5 percent stake in the block from Total
SA in 2011 for $983 million.  Increasing its stake in the block, currently operated by  BP
Plc (BP/) , will add 14,600 barrels of oil per day for China
Petrochemical, it said in the statement. The deal is pending
approval from the governments of China and Angola.  Sinopec’s shares dropped to their lowest level in almost a
year in  Hong Kong  trading. The stock fell 4.1 percent to HK$5.10
as of 11:51 a.m local time. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
dropped 1.7 percent.  Sinopec shares likely fell with other oil companies on
concerns that a credit crunch for China’s banks could hamper
borrowing, and that the U.S. Federal Reserve will begin to draw
down its economic stimulus, said Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd. in Shanghai.  Adding overseas assets should be good news for Sinopec and
its parent, as upstream businesses traditionally provide better
margins, Shi said. “The positive news was just buried by all
the negative concerns,” Shi said.  Sinopec is likely to be the eventual home for the Angolan
purchase, although it could take a long time to transfer the
assets between the parent and the listed company, said Shi.  PetroChina Co. (857) , the country’s biggest oil producer,
declined 2.3 percent to HK$7.92, while  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s
biggest offshore oil explorer, dropped 2.5 percent to HK$12.40.  For Related News and Information:
