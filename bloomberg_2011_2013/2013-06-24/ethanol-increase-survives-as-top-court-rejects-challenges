The U.S. Supreme Court left intact
Environmental Protection Agency rules allowing higher
concentrations of corn-based ethanol in gasoline, turning away
appeals from the grocery, auto and oil industries.  The justices today let stand a federal appeals court ruling
that said trade groups representing the industries lacked legal
standing to press their challenges.  The appeals court said the challengers hadnâ€™t shown their
members would be injured by the rules. The groups contended that
increased use of ethanol would push up the price of food and
gasoline and harm vehicle engines.  The dispute centered on EPA rules allowing E15, a blend of
unleaded gasoline that contains up to 15 percent ethanol. The
EPA has approved E15 for cars and light trucks made for the
model year 2001 and later.  The cases are Grocery Manufacturers Association v.
Environmental Protection Agency, 12-1055;  Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers  v. Environmental Protection Agency, 12-1167; and
American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers v. Environmental
Protection Agency, 12-1229.  To contact the reporter on this story:
