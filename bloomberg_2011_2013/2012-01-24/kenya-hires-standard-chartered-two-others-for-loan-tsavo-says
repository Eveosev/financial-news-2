Kenya’s government appointed a group
of three lenders, including  Standard Chartered Bank Ltd. (SCBL) , as
arrangers for its $600 million international loan, said Fred Mweni, chief executive officer of Tsavo Securities Ltd.  “The ministry of finance has appointed a consortium made up
of  Standard Chartered , Citibank Kenya and CfC Stanbic, for the
loan,” Mweni said in a phone interview yesterday from Nairobi,
the capital. An announcement on the loan may be made as early as
today, he said.  Mweni is vice chairman of the Market Leaders Forum, a panel
that includes bond-market traders, central bank and Finance
Ministry officials that meets monthly to discuss government
financing. Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta said on Jan. 17 the
appointment of the banks would be made within two weeks.  Geoffrey Mwau, the economic secretary at the Finance
Ministry, didn’t answer his mobile phone when called three times
today for comment.  James Makau, a spokesman for  CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd. (CFCB) , said in
an e-mailed response to questions yesterday that the bank was
“not in a position to comment on the Kenyan government’s funding
programmes.” Spokeswomen for Citibank Kenya Ltd. and Standard
Chartered declined to comment when called yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
