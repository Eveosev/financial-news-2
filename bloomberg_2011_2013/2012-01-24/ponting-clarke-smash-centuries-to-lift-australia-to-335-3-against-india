Ricky Ponting  and  Michael Clarke  hit
unbeaten centuries to lift  Australia  to 335-3 on day one of the
final cricket Test against  India  in  Adelaide .  Ponting made 137 after becoming only the third batsman to
reach 13,000 Test runs. Australia captain Clarke, who won the
toss, struck 140 as his team seeks to wrap up a 4-0 series win.  Ponting and Clarke shared an unbroken 251-run stand from
385 balls after the home team slipped to 84-3 in the morning
session following the dismissals of  David Warner ,  Shaun Marsh 
and  Ed Cowan .  Ponting earlier passed 13,000 Test runs in his 275th
innings at the elite level. The only two players to have scored
more Test runs,  Sachin Tendulkar  (15,432) and  Rahul Dravid 
(13,262), were fielding at the Adelaide Oval today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
