Coach Inc. (COH) , the largest U.S. luxury
handbag maker, climbed the most in almost two months after
reporting quarterly profit that topped analysts’ estimates,
driven by holiday sales in  North America .  Coach  rose  5.8 percent to $67.97 in  New York , the biggest
gain since Nov. 28. The shares advanced 10 percent last year.  Net income in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31 rose
15 percent to $347.5 million, or $1.18 a share, from $303.4
million, or $1, a year earlier, New York-based Coach said today
in a statement. Analysts projected $1.15 a share, the average of
24  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Shoppers bought $428 Madison satchels, $298 Kristin
shoulder bags and $198 Poppy totes after  consumer confidence 
rose to an eight-month high in December and financial markets
stabilized. Sales at North American stores open at least a year
climbed 8.8 percent, exceeding the 6 percent estimate of
 Christine Chen , an analyst for Needham & Co., and the 5 percent
projection of David Schick at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  “It was an absolute solid quarter,” Chen said in an
interview. Coach isn’t as exposed to Europe as competitors such
as Tiffany & Co., which helped it surpass estimates, said San
Francisco-based Chen, who recommends buying Coach shares.  Revenue advanced 15 percent to $1.45 billion, topping the
$1.43 billion average  estimate  of 21 analysts.  Chief Executive Officer Lew Frankfort said the company’s
men’s business is projected to double to $400 million in 2012.  Tiffany fell the most in more than three years on Jan. 10
after reducing its annual earnings forecast because of slowing
sales in  Europe , where the sovereign debt crisis prompted
consumers to curb spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
