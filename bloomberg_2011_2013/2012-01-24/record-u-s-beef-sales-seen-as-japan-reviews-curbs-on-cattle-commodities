U.S. farmers, poised to ship record
beef cargoes for a second straight year, may get a further boost
as  Japan , once their biggest overseas customer, considers easing
trade curbs imposed after an outbreak of mad cow disease.  Sales to Japan may jump 43 percent to 202,100 metric tons,
the most since 2003, should the restrictions end in the second
quarter, Global AgriTrends, a Denver-based research company,
estimates. The government may raise the age limit on cattle
slaughtered for beef to 30 months from 20 months about the
middle of the year, according to Keiko Yamaguchi, executive
director of consumer equity research at Nomura Securities Co. in
Tokyo.  Increasing sales to Japan would help shore up farm income
at a time when the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is forecasting
a drop in wheat, corn and soybean exports. Cattle futures rose
to a record six times this month and traders anticipate higher
prices through at least April 2013 after the herd shrank to the
smallest since 1973 as of July 1, Chicago Mercantile Exchange
data show. A drought in the southern U.S. last year and rising
feed costs prompted ranchers to cull livestock.  “We go to 30 months of age again, all of a sudden most of
our cattle are eligible,” said Brett Stuart, the co-founder of
Global AgriTrends and a former economist for the U.S. Meat
Export Federation who was raised on a cattle ranch in  Utah . “We
go from a restriction that probably was only allowing 30, 35
percent of U.S.  cattle  to provide cuts for Japan and we take
that percentage up to roughly 90, 95 percent.”  Goldman Sachs  Cattle rose 6.4 percent to $1.29175 a pound on the CME this
year, beating the 2.2 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 commodities. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of
equities advanced 5.2 percent as Treasuries lost 0.8 percent, a
Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Futures for delivery in April 2013 closed at $1.333 today.
The most widely held option confers the right to buy at $1.30 by
April, CME data show. Cattle may reach $1.38 by October, said
 Rich Nelson , the director of research at McHenry, Illinois-based
Allendale Inc., who has been studying agricultural markets since
1997.  Japanese imports of U.S. beef shrank to almost zero in
2004, from 298,039 tons in 2003, after the country joined South
Korea and  China  in banning U.S. supply after the discovery of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The brain-wasting disease was
found in three U.S. cows, the last of them in 2006. The U.K.
found more than 184,000 cases since 1987,  according  to the
Paris-based World Organisation for  Animal Health , or OIE.  Older Livestock  Shipments (BUSEEXPT)  to Japan rebounded since the country relaxed its
ban in 2005 to allow meat from 20-month-old cattle or younger.
The curbs on beef from older livestock meant about $1 billion a
year in lost sales, the Denver-based  National Cattlemen’s Beef
Association  said in January 2010. The OIE gave the U.S. a
“controlled-risk” rating in 2007, meaning meat from cattle of
any age can be traded.  The U.S. may ship a record 974,000 tons of beef in 2012,
worth about $5.13 billion, compared with an estimated 914,500
tons in 2011, the Denver-based U.S. Meat Export Federation
predicts. Combined farm exports will probably drop 3.9 percent
to $132 billion in the 12 months ending in September, retreating
from a record, the USDA said in November.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators are getting less
bullish on cattle. They cut their net-long position, or bets on
rising prices, by 39 percent to 66,997 futures and options since
Oct. 18, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.  Age of Cattle  There is no certainty that Japan will ease the curbs on
U.S. beef. The government first proposed raising the limit on
the age of cattle to 30 months in 2007 and Japanese officials
met with their U.S. counterparts on the topic for the first time
in three years in September 2010.  A panel on mad cow disease at Japan’s Food Safety
Commission began reviewing potential health risks related to the
proposed changes on Jan. 19. Speaking after that meeting in
 Tokyo , the panel’s chairman, Takeo Sakai, wasn’t able to say
when a decision would be taken. The health ministry will only
raise the age limit to 30 months if the safety body determines
it poses no additional risk to consumers.  The commission probably will take two to three months to
complete its review, said Nobuyuki Fujino, the Tokyo-based
senior chief economist at the Norinchukin Research Institute,
which studies economic trends in agriculture. Should it rule the
changes are safe, the government may then take “a couple of
months” to modify the regulation, he said.  Import Tariffs  U.S.  farmers  may also gain from increased shipments to
South Korea, which reopened its market in 2008 to beef from
cattle up to 30 months old. The two nations signed a free trade
pact last year that will reduce import tariffs of as much as 40
percent over the next 15 years.  The U.S. supplied 68 percent of  South Korea ’s beef  imports 
in 2003, dropping to zero the following year, according to data
from the Korea Meat Trade Association. Shipments recovered to
99,047 tons in the first 11 months of 2011, accounting for 37
percent of imports, the data show.  Japan is already buying more U.S. beef, with purchases
rising 32 percent to 87,969 tons in the first eight months of
the fiscal year that began April 1, agriculture ministry data
show. The gains were at the expense of  Australia (AUF$BEEF) , whose
shipments to the Asian nation dropped 5 percent to 229,223 tons.
The  U.S. dollar  weakened 8.4 percent against the yen since April
while the Australian dollar appreciated 7.2 percent.  U.S. Competition  Shipments to  Japan (BEEFJA00) , the largest export market for
Australian beef, may drop about 4 percent to 336,000 tons in the
12 months ending June 30, 2012, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said in a
report last month.  The decline will be driven by increasing U.S. competition
and stagnant Japanese demand, the government research unit  said .
The nation’s per capita beef consumption dropped 25 percent in
the past decade as pork gained 23 percent and chicken 21
percent. Japanese consumers prefer “higher marbled U.S. beef,”
Abares said, referring to the amount of visible fat.  “The relaxation would increase demand from the food-
service industry for American meat,” said Yamaguchi of Nomura
Securities. U.S. beef is seen as “superior to Australian
products in the Japanese market in terms of its taste and
convenience for processing.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
