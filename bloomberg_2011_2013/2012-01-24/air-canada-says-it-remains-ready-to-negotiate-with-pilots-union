Air Canada (AC/B)  said it’s willing to keep
talking to its pilots after their union accused the nation’s
largest airline of abandoning negotiations.  The bargaining process is advancing to mediation, as
permitted by  Canada ’s Labor Code, the Montreal-based carrier
said today in a statement.  Air Canada (AC/A)  said it “remains at the negotiating table
awaiting a response” from the pilots union to a
“comprehensive” proposal the company made on Jan. 16.  The company failed to make a proposal within a 60-day
conciliation process, the Air Canada Pilots Association said
earlier today in a statement. The pilots and a federal
conciliator asked Air Canada to continue the process, and the
airline refused, according to the union.  To contact the reporter for this story:
