Japanese  stock   futures  rose after
the yen weakened against the dollar and the euro after a
stalemate emerged between European finance ministers and Greek
bondholders over how to resolve the nation’s debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Sony Corp. (6758) , a consumer
electronics exporter that earns more than 40 percent of its
revenue from the U.S. and Europe, rose 0.5 percent.  Honda Motor
Co. (7267) , Japan’s No. 2 carmaker by revenue, gained 0.7 percent after
Macquarie Group Ltd. increased its target price for the stock.
Australian equities advanced, with  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s biggest miner, rising 0.4 percent after metal prices
advanced.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  expiring in
March closed at 8,815 in Chicago yesterday compared with 8,790
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,820 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
rose 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.2
percent in Wellington. Stock markets in  China ,  Hong Kong  and
 Taiwan  are shut for the Lunar New Year holiday.  “The yen is weakening, fueling expectations Japanese
exporters’ earnings will turn up over the next fiscal year,”
said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “Investors can’t be optimistic on the Greek
debt relief talks until they are finalized, but extreme worries
about them are easing.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  advanced 0.2
percent today after Apple Inc., the world’s largest technology
company, reported record quarterly sales and profit. Holiday
purchases of the new iPhone 4S helped the company avoid a slump
in consumer spending that has hurt rivals.  Global Stocks Fall  The index slid 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday, ending a
five-day advance, after the Greek stalemate emerged.  Global stocks slumped as European finance ministers pushed
bondholders to provide greater debt relief for  Greece , spurring
concern the nation may fail to make a March 20 bond payment
deadline. The  International Monetary Fund  also cut its forecast
for global economic growth.  The dollar rose, reaching the highest level this year
against the yen, as the Greek stalemate spurred demand for safer
investments. The yen fell against 12 of 16 major peers tracked
by Bloomberg.  The Japanese currency depreciated to as low as 77.85
against the dollar last night in Tokyo, the lowest level since
Dec. 29. Against the euro, the yen weakened to 101.30 today from
100.20 at the close of stock trading yesterday in Tokyo. A
weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency.  Metals Advance  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six metals
including copper and aluminum rose 0.3 percent yesterday to the
highest level since Sept. 20.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 5.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with increases of 4.5 percent by the
S&P 500 and 4.7 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks in
the Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index in Europe.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index  of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. slid 0.3 percent to 101.54 yesterday in New
York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
