Bolivia  seized  Pan American  Energy
LLC’s stake in the $1.6 billion Caipipendi natural-gas project,
saying the Argentine company failed to meet investment targets.  State oil company  Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales
Bolivianos , known as YPFB, will take over Pan American’s 25
percent stake in the field, Energy Minister Juan Jose Sosa said
today. YPFB will evaluate Buenos Aires-based Pan American’s
investment to date in a bid to conciliate, Sosa said.  “Pan American hasn’t contributed its percentage, so we’re
carrying out an obligatory transfer of the contract to a YPFB
subsidiary,” Sosa said in a broadcast by La Paz-based  Radio
Panamericana .  Oil and gas output has fallen in the Andean nation since
President  Evo Morales  raised taxes and started seizing
refineries and fields in 2006 to increase state control over
Bolivia’s natural resources. Private investment in the industry
plunged 69 percent to $271 million in 2009, the latest data
available, from $865 million a decade earlier, according to
YPFB.  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  control the field, which is
slated to begin production this year.  Pan American won’t comment until it’s officially notified
of the government’s decision, a company official who declined to
be named citing company policy, said by telephone.  Repsol spokesman Kristian Rix declined to comment in an e-
mailed response to questions. BG didn’t immediately return
telephone calls seeing comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
