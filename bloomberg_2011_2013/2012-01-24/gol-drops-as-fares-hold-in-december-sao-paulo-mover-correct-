(Corrects value of average fares per kilometer in the third
paragraph.)  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) 
headed for its biggest drop in more than a week after  Brazil ’s
second-largest carrier by market value said a measure of average
fares was little changed last month.  Gol, second to Tam SA by market value in Brazil,  fell  1.9
percent to 12.15 reais at 2:09 p.m. in Sao Paulo, heading for
the biggest drop on a closing basis since Jan. 13. The benchmark
Bovespa index  slipped   0.2 percent.  Gol’s yields, or the average price paid per passenger for
each kilometer flown, climbed 2 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. The yield, a measure of an airline’s
profitability, was stable in December at between 21 centavos and
21.5 centavos.  The yield “improved in relation to the third quarter, but
not as much as expected,” Leonardo Nitta, a Banco do Brasil
analyst, said by telephone from  Sao Paulo  today. Gol’s clients
have a “low-cost profile and the company is being harmed more
due to that,” he added.  Chief Executive Officer Constantino de Oliveira Jr. said in
an Oct. 26 interview in  New York  that the company’s yields were
improving. The yields  fell 14 percent  in the second quarter from
a year earlier amid increased supply in the domestic market, and
increased 7 percent in the third quarter. Gol is set to release
its fourth-quarter earnings on March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
