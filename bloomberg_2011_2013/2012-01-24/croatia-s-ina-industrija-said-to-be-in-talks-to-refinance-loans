INA Industrija Nafte d.d. ,  Croatia ’s
largest oil refiner, is in talks with lenders to refinance
existing loans, according to a person with direct knowledge of
the deal.  INA , which is owned by Hungarian refiner Mol Nyrt., signed
a $1 billion revolving credit in 2007 which is due to mature in
March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That loan for
the Zagreb-based company pays interest at 30 basis points more
than the London interbank offered rate, the data show.  “As a usual activity, INA is negotiating with banks about
possibilities in the market and possible cooperation so that it
could finance its business,” the company said in an e-mailed
statement translated from Croatian.  To contact the reporters on this story:
