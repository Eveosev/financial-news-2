The Bovespa index rose for a seventh
day, the longest winning streak in 15 months, as mining
companies  MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA  and  Vale SA (VALE5)  followed
metals prices higher.  Braskem SA (BRKM5) ,  Latin America ’s largest petrochemicals
producer, jumped to a two-month high. Oil producer  Petroleo
Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  advanced a second day after saying it will appoint
a new chief executive officer from within the company.  Brazil’s benchmark equity index climbed 0.2 percent to
62,486.22 at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Thirty-nine
stocks rose on the gauge, while 30 dropped. The real weakened
0.2 percent to 1.7585 per  U.S. dollar . The  Bloomberg Base Metals
3-Month Price Commodity Index (CMDIBAS3)  rose 0.5 percent.  “Commodities stocks fell a lot last year, and now
investors may be realizing those losses were excessive,”
Alexandre Ghirghi, who manages about 150 million reais ($85.3
million) at Metodo Investimentos, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .
“Despite the problems  Europe  faces with its debt crisis, there
are some signs that the outlook for global growth is not as bad
as stocks were pricing in last year.”  Braskem gained 2.6 percent to 14.60 reais, the highest
price since Nov. 16. Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, added 1.3 percent to 41.58 reais. MMX climbed 2.1
percent to 7.82 reais.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, added 1.1
percent to 25.40 reais. The company said yesterday Maria das
Gracas Foster will replace Jose Sergio Gabrielli as chief
executive officer. The stock has jumped 4.9 percent since Jan.
20.  Brazil Inflation  The Bovespa earlier fell as much as 1.2 percent as
homebuilders tumbled after a report showed Brazilian inflation
accelerated more than expected. Consumer prices, as measured by
the IPCA-15 index, rose 0.65 percent in mid-January from the
previous month, the national statistics agency said today. That
was higher than the 0.56 percent median estimate of 44 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA ,  Brazil ’s fifth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, sank 3 percent to 13.45 reais, the worst
performer on the Bovespa index.  The Bovespa has advanced 10 percent this year, buoyed by
Brazil’s interest-rate cuts, signs of growth in the U.S. and
renewed optimism Europe may be closer to solving its debt
crisis. The gauge trades at 9.9 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, which compares with the ratio of 10.1 for MSCI Inc.’s
measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge sank 18
percent in 2011.  Traders moved 6.67 billion reais in  stocks  in Sao Paulo
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 6.49 billion reais in 2011, according to data
from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
