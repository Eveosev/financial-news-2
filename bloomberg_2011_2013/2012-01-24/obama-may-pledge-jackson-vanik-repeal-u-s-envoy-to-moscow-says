President  Barack Obama  may pledge to
repeal the Jackson-Vanik amendment, a Cold War-era law passed to
punish the communist Soviet Union, said  Michael McFaul , the U.S.
ambassador to Russia.  “In the State of the Union speech today, hoping to hear
about repeal of Jackson-Vanik for Russia,” McFaul said on his
Twitter Inc. account. “Long overdue, good for U.S./good for
Russia.”  In his third State of the Union address before a joint
session of Congress, Obama will focus on economic concerns in an
election-year speech.  The U.S. risks losing out on increased exports to Russia
once the country formally joins the World Trade Organization
because of the 1974 law, which barred favorable trade relations
with the  Soviet Union  because it wouldn’t let Jewish citizens
emigrate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
