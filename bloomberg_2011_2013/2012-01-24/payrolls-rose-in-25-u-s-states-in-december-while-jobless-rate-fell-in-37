Unemployment dropped in 37 U.S.
states in December, indicating the improvement in the job market
is broad based as the economy picks up.  Alabama  showed the biggest decrease in joblessness, with
its rate falling to 8.1 percent last month from 8.7 percent in
November, a report from the Labor Department showed today in
 Washington . Payrolls increased in 25 states, led by Texas.  Further employment gains put consumers in a better position
to boost household spending, the biggest part of the world’s
largest economy. U.S. employers added 200,000 workers in
December and the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 8.5
percent, the lowest since February 2009, the Labor Department
reported on Jan. 6.  “We are probably on the cusp of an important turning point
in the labor market,” said  Carl Riccadonna , a senior U.S.
economist at Deutsch Bank Securities in  New York . “Businesses
have been straining their workforces to squeeze out more output,
but that can’t go on indefinitely. They have to add more
workers. This is finally happening.”  Texas led the nation with a gain of 20,200 workers,
followed by  Indiana  with 15,100. Payrolls in New York dropped by
14,000, the biggest decrease among the 24 states showing losses.  California , Texas  For all of 2011, California gained the most jobs as
payrolls grew by 263,200 workers, followed by Texas, with
204,500, and Florida, which showed a 113,900 increase. In
percentage terms,  North Dakota , Utah and Oklahoma showed the
biggest advances in employment.  Michigan’s jobless rate dropped to 9.3 percent in December
from 9.8 percent the prior month, making it the state with the
second-biggest decrease. The rate is down 1.8 percentage points
over the past 12 months, which may in part reflect a rebound in
auto making.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest U.S. carmaker, posted a
10 percent gain in sales last month from a year earlier, and
closed out 2011 with 2.15 million light vehicles purchased, an
11 percent gain.  “We were able to end the year on, what we feel, is a high
note,”  Erich Merkle , Ford’s U.S. sales analyst, said on a
conference call Jan. 4. “December was a strong number.”  Nevada’s jobless rate, at 12.6 percent last month, remained
the highest in the U.S. Nonetheless, it’s shown the most
improvement over the past year, falling 2.3 percentage points.  Lowest Jobless Rate  North Dakota again had the lowest level of unemployment at
3.3 percent.  The economy probably expanded at a 3 percent annual pace in
the fourth quarter, up from a 1.8 percent gain in the previous
three month, figures from the Commerce Department may show on
Jan. 26 according to the median forecast of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News.  The  unemployment rate  in  Florida , home to the next
Republican presidential primary contest, fell to 9.9 percent
from 10 percent the prior month.  State and local employment data are derived independently
from the national statistics, which are typically released on
the first Friday of every month. The state figures are subject
to larger sampling errors because they come from smaller
surveys, making the national figures more reliable, according to
the government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
