Gennum Corp., a semiconductor
designer, soared 119 percent, the most since at least 1987,
after agreeing to be bought by  Semtech Corp. (SMTC)  for about C$500
million ($494 million).  Semtech, based in Camarillo,  California , will pay C$13.55 a
share for Gennum, which makes products for the fiber-optics and
broadcast industries. Gennum surged C$7.29 to C$13.44, the
highest since 2007, as of 11:45 a.m. in Toronto. Semtech rallied
7.8 percent to $28.99 in  New York .  “After a comprehensive review of Gennum’s strategic
options, we are convinced that this is the best avenue to unlock
the underlying value for shareholders that has been created by
the Gennum team,” Gennum Chief Executive Officer Franz J. Fink
said in a press release issued after markets closed yesterday.  Gennum, based in Burlington, Ontario, 50 kilometers (31
miles) southwest of Toronto, was founded as Linear Technology
Inc. in 1973 from a division of Westinghouse Canada Inc. Its
shares fell 15 percent in the year ending yesterday.  “This is the best possible outcome for Gennum shareholders
given the company’s position in its respective markets,” Brian Piccioni, an analyst at Bank of Montreal, wrote in a note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
