EON AG (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
said it has agreed on a labor deal with the Verdi and IGBCE
unions that will extend through 2016 and allow EON to implement
its cost-cutting plan.  EON, based in Dusseldorf, reiterated plans to reduce about
6,000 positions in Germany and about 11,000 globally, in an e-
mailed statement today.  Utilities are selling assets and cutting jobs to lower
costs and boost profit margins as a weakening economy weighs on
electricity demand and Germany’s nuclear exit removes revenue
streams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
