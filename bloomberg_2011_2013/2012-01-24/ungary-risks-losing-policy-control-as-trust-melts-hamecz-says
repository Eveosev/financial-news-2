Hungary risks making its economic
policy ineffective as trust in the government among financial
investors, companies and households declines, said Istvan Hamecz, head of the fund management unit of OTP Bank Nyrt.  The self-described “unorthodox” methods of Prime Minister
 Viktor Orban ’s Cabinet undermined credibility and
predictability, Hamecz wrote in an article posted on the  website 
of weekly newspaper Heti Valasz today.  “If the government doesn’t manage to restore trust quickly
and return to a good equilibrium of trust, then the situation
may fast degenerate,” wrote Hamecz, a former central bank chief
economist, adding that his comments were based on conversations
with company executives and individual savers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
