While  Mitt Romney  used campaign
appearances in  Florida (NFSEFL) ’s Republican presidential race yesterday
to try to turn the attention back to President Barack Obama, his
opponents sought to keep the focus on tax returns showing the
former private-equity executive made $21.6 million in 2010.  “That’s a lot of money,” former Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum , one of Romney’s rivals in the Jan. 31 primary, told
the Palm Beach Post in an interview. “He paid it in capital
gains,” Santorum also said, referring to the 13.9 percent tax
rate on Romney’s income.  Democrats, too, combed through Romney’s 203-page 2010 tax
return, released yesterday morning, as well as his estimated
earnings for 2011 of $20.9 million in adjusted gross income.  In a conference call with reporters, Ben Ginsberg, Romney’s
campaign attorney, said: “It’s interesting to note that there
are 26 people from the  Chicago  area listening in.” Obama’s re-
election campaign is headquartered in Chicago.  Romney’s wealth -- the result of his work at Boston-based
Bain Capital LLC -- has become a central theme of the Republican
nominating contest. Aides to his campaign hoped the release of
the returns would limit the attacks and let the former
Massachusetts governor concentrate on economic issues, a topic
they see as playing to his strengths.  TV Forum  Economic issues may come up today when Romney, Santorum,
and  Newt Gingrich , Romney’s prime rival in the Republican race,
participate separately in a forum hosted by the Spanish-language
television network Univision TV in Miami. U.S. Representative
 Ron Paul  of  Texas , the fourth candidate for the party’s
nomination, has no campaign events scheduled in Florida.  Gingrich has surged in  Florida (BEESFL) , according to a poll
released today by Hamden, Connecticut-based  Quinnipiac
University . The telephone survey of 601 likely Republican
primary voters conducted Jan. 19-23 shows Romney at 36 percent
and Gingrich at 34 percent, with a margin of error of plus or
minus four percentage points. In a Quinnipiac poll released Jan.
9, Romney led Gingrich 36 percent to 24 percent.  Romney earned more than half his income from  capital gains 
and dividends, which are taxed at a top rate of 15 percent,
rather than the 35 percent top rate for ordinary income, the
filings showed. He donated $7 million to charity in the last two
years, including $4.1 million to the Mormon church.  Obligations as Taxpayers  Romney campaign advisers said the release should answer
questions about his investment and tax payments, saying the
candidate and his wife, Ann, had “fully satisfied” their
obligations as taxpayers.  “Governor Romney has paid 100 percent of what he owes,”
said Ginsberg.  Still, Democrats argued that two years of records were
insufficient to fully evaluate Romney’s finances, pointing to
the 23 years of returns he turned over to Arizona Senator  John McCain ’s presidential campaign in 2008, when he was being
considered for the ticket’s vice presidential spot.  “Romney thought McCain’s campaign was entitled to 23
years’ worth of tax returns,” the executive director of the
 Democratic National Committee , Patrick Gaspard, said in a
statement. “He’s made clear that Americans are only entitled to
one year’s worth of returns.”  Romney’s ‘Prebuttal’  At a stop in Tampa yesterday, Romney blasted Obama for
failing to restart the struggling U.S. economy as he delivered
what his campaign called a “prebuttal” to the president’s
State of the Union speech to Congress last night.  Later, in a remark that recalled Romney’s support for
corporations in August, he said, “The banks aren’t bad people.
They’re just overwhelmed right now.”  Romney, speaking in front of a home in foreclosure in
Lehigh Acres,  Florida , went on to say that “banks are scared to
death to write down loans for fear that it will make them go
insolvent.”  During an Aug. 11 visit to  Iowa , Romney responded to chants
of “Wall Street greed” among his audience by saying,
“Corporations are people, my friend. Everything corporations
earn ultimately goes to people.”  Romney also used his Lehigh Acres stop to spotlight the
$1.6 million over eight years that government-backed mortgage-
lending company  Freddie Mac  paid to a consulting firm owned by
Gingrich.  ‘A Mess’  “Housing has become a mess, in large measure because
government got in the middle of it,” Romney said. “I’m running
against a guy, as you know in this primary, who was working for
one of these guys, for Freddie Mac.”  Romney suggested Gingrich used his influence to profit from
pushing a policy direction that was ultimately bad for the
nation.  “He was standing up as the former speaker of the House and
someone who many people respected as a conservative leader,”
Romney said. “He was standing up and defending Freddie Mac and
 Fannie Mae (FNMA) ,” the government-backed mortgage-finance companies.  Gingrich said those charges were “outrageously
dishonest,” given that Romney’s financial-disclosure report
showed investments in both Freddie Mac and  Fannie Mae .  “I don’t own any Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock,”
Gingrich said. “He does, so presumably he was getting richer.”  Gingrich was met by enthusiastic crowds as he campaigned
across Florida’s western coast yesterday. He barely mentioned
his Republican opponent at his three events, instead turning his
fire on Obama.  ‘Why We Couldn’t’  The president has gone from “‘Yes we can’ to ‘why we
couldn’t,’” he told thousands gathered in an airplane hangar in
Sarasota.  While Gingrich rallied the crowds, his aides worked to
raise the money necessary to run statewide.  R.C. Hammond, Gingrich’s spokesman, said the campaign has
raised $2 million since its 12-point win over Romney in  South
Carolina ’s Jan. 21 primary.  Winning Our Future, a political action committee supporting
Gingrich while operating independently of his campaign, bought
$6 million of advertising time in the state yesterday and
released an ad painting Romney as aligned with Obama, said  Rick
Tyler , a strategist for the group.  “Think you know Mitt? Think again,” the ad says. “When
Mitt Romney invented government-run health care, Romney advisers
helped  Barack Obama  write the disastrous Obamacare.”  The $6 million committed to airtime is enough for Gingrich
backers to blanket Florida with ads. It costs about $1 million a
week to compete in the 11 media markets in Florida, the fourth
most populous state.  Questions on Finances  Gingrich faced questions about his own finances during a
Jan. 23  debate  in Tampa as he fended off attacks from Romney on
the consulting work he did for Freddie Mac and his advocacy for
a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors that added to
the federal deficit.  Calling Gingrich an “influence peddler,” Romney told him:
“You are being paid by companies at the same time you’re
encouraging people to pass legislation which is in their
favor.”  Still, the tax issue dominated the campaign talk yesterday.
Romney “will have a very difficult time getting any other
message out except for debating his taxes,” said  Eddie Mahe , a
Republican consultant who hasn’t endorsed a candidate. “It is
unbelievable they could allow themselves to get into that
situation. That’s not what you want to be talking about.”  Pushing for Details  Gingrich and other Republicans pushed for details about
Romney’s tax obligations for weeks, criticizing him for his
wealth and tenure as head of private-equity firm Bain Capital
LLC. Initially, Romney resisted releasing his returns, arguing
that the financial-disclosure documents all federal candidates
must file gave a sufficient picture of his personal finances.  After his loss in  South Carolina (BEESSC) , Romney relented.  “We just made a mistake in holding off as long as we
did,” he said in a Jan. 22 interview on Fox.  Delaying the release was “a terrible blunder,” said Seth McKee, a political science professor at the University of South
Florida in  St. Petersburg . “Once you get into that situation,
you created the problem yourself.”  At least some voters didn’t seem quite as concerned.
Falguni Patel, 53, a wine store owner from Lutz, Florida, who
attended Romney’s event yesterday in Tampa, said she thinks it’s
good that he released his tax records and has no concerns that
his wealth would be used against him in a general election.  “We need more millionaires in America,” she said. “He
can come back and say that he built himself into what he is
today.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
