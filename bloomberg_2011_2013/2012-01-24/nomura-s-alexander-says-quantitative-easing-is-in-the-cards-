A third round of bond buying by the
 Federal Reserve  is “in the cards” and the best tool policy
makers have for bolstering economic growth, said Lewis Alexander, U.S. chief economist at Nomura Holdings Inc.  “The fundamental challenge they face is they don’t have
great tools at this point to support growth,” Alexander said
today during a panel discussion at the Bloomberg Sovereign Debt
Crisis Conference hosted by Bloomberg Link in  New York .
“Quantitative easing in this environment is the most effective
tool they have. Our expectation is they will get to this at some
point in the future.”  Fed officials began a two-day meeting in Washington today
after voicing differences in recent speeches over whether
additional accommodation is needed to spur growth. Any new asset
purchases would follow two rounds of buying totaling $2.3
trillion that lasted from December 2008 until June 2011.  The issue facing the Fed is how to inject more stimulus
into the economy, while sending “a strong signal” about  price
stability , Alexander said. “They’re struggling with that now”
and “have got to worry about how they send that signal to make
sure markets are on board.”  Also speaking on the panel was  Peter Orszag , former
director of the Congressional Budget Office and now vice
chairman of global banking at Citigroup Inc. He said the U.S.
needs mechanisms to combat political “inertia.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
