Petroplus Holdings AG (PPHN) , the refiner
planning to file for insolvency, is in talks with between five
and 10 potential buyers for its plant at Cressier,  Switzerland ,
according to a local government official.  “Some very big companies are interested,” Thierry
Grosjean, head of the canton of Neuchatel’s economy department,
told reporters.  Grosjean didn’t provide the identity of the potential
buyers or comment on media reports that Socar Trading Co., a
unit of  Azerbaijan ’s state-backed energy company, was among the
candidates.  Socar Trading declined to comment in response to a call to
the firm’s Geneva offices today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
