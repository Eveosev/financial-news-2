German bunds fell, pushing 10-year
yields to the highest in a month, as a euro-area report showing
services and manufacturing output unexpectedly expanded in
January damped demand for the region’s safest securities.  Greek two-year notes gained and five-year debt fell as
talks between the nation and its private creditors reached an
impasse and Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
the program was “off track.” The Netherlands sold debt due in
2013 and 2042 today, while  Spain  auctioned bills.  The German 10-year  yield  climbed one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.98 percent at 9:51 a.m. London time after
reaching 2 percent, the highest since Dec. 21. The 2 percent
bund due in January 2022 fell 0.095, or 95 euro cents per 1,000-
euro ($1,303) face amount, to 100.155.  Greece ’s two-year yield dropped 967 basis points to 166.33
percent, and the price rose 1.32 to 23.06 percent of face value.
The five-year yield climbed 428 basis points to 58.2 percent.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the services and manufacturing industries jumped to
50.4 from 48.3 in December, according to initial estimates.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a reading of 48.5. A
number below 50 indicates contraction.  Bunds have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French  government
bonds  have declined 0.1 percent and Greek debt lost 0.2 percent,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
