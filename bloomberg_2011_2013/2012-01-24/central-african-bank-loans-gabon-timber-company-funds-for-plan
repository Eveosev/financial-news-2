The  Development Bank of Central
African States  agreed to lend the National Timber Co. of Gabon 8
billion CFA francs ($15.8 million) to help fund the construction
of a wood-processing complex.  An agreement on the financing was signed by Michael Andade,
president of the lender, and Serge Rivain Okana, chief executive
officer of the Gabonese company, the bank said in a statement
handed to reporters today in Brazzaville, the capital.  The company, known by its French acronym SNBG, will also
receive a 1 billion-franc loan from  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) â€™s
Gabonese unit, according to the statement.  The wood-processing complex, which includes three
production lines, will cost an estimated 64.9 billion francs, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
