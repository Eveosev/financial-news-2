German bonds rose, while Italian and
French securities dropped, increasing the additional yield
investors demand to hold lower-rated sovereign debt.  The yield on  Germany â€™s 10-year bunds dropped two basis
points to 1.95 percent at 11:01 a.m. London time. The rate on
French securities of a similar maturity increased three basis
points to 3.17 percent, increasing the difference in yield, or
 spread , between the bonds by six basis points to 123 basis
points.  The Italian-German yield gap rose seven basis points to 420
basis points, while the Spanish-German spread increased five
basis points to 354 basis points.  Finnish, Austrian and Dutch bonds also underperformed
benchmark German debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
