Mauritanian  Foreign Affairs  and
Cooperation Minister Hamadi Ould Hamadi criticized the payment
of ransoms to free Westerners allegedly kidnapped by al-Qaedaâ€™s
northwest African branch, state-owned Horizons newspaper said.  Paying ransoms funds the operations of al-Qaeda in the
Islamic Maghreb and may encourage others to conduct kidnappings
and sell hostages to the group, Nouakchott-based Horizons cited
Hamadi as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
