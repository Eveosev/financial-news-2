Petroleos de Venezuela SA will
announce planned maintenance on a catalytic cracker unit at its
Amuay refinery in Falcon state on Jan. 30, company president

that it was delaying planned maintenance at the Amuay refinery
until January and that the program would last two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
