Japan  will probably miss its goal of
balancing the budget by fiscal 2020 even if it doubles the
nation’s  sales tax , government estimates show.  Japan will have a primary deficit of 3.1 percent of gross
domestic product in the year, the Cabinet Office said in a
report released in Tokyo today. The projections are made based
on assumption that the world’s third-largest economy will grow
about 1 percent annually. The government had wanted to achieve a
primary balance, which is achieved when revenue matches
spending, excluding bond sales and interest payments, by the
year ending March 2021.  To contact the reporter on this story:
