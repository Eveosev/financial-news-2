advanced for a fourth consecutive month. Stronger tire

accessories and tire stores. Receipts at new car dealers
edged up 0.1%, following larger increases the previous
three months. Sales at other motor vehicle dealers (-1.4%)
and used car dealers (-0.5%) both declined in November.  Clothing and clothing accessories stores reported a
0.9% sales gain. This was the third increase in a row.  Following five monthly gains, sales at food and

from lower sales at supermarkets and other grocery stores

registered a third consecutive sales decrease in November.
Lower sales at home furnishings stores (-3.1%) accounted
for this decline.  Sales up in half of the provinces  Retail sales rose in  Quebec  and the four Western
