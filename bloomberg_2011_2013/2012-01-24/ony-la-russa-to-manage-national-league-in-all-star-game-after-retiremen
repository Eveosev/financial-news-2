Tony La Russa  will manage the
National League team in Julyâ€™s All-Star Game even though he
retired after leading the St. Louis Cardinals to the World
Series championship last year, the second such role in baseball
history.  Major League Baseball made the announcement today in a news
release.  The only other retired manager to lead an All-Star team was
John McGraw in 1933, a year after he stepped down from the  New
York Giants , MLB said in the statement.  The game is scheduled for Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City
on July 10.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
