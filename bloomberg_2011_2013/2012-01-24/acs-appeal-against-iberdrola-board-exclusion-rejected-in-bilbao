Actividades de Construccion y
Servicios SA , the largest shareholder in Iberdrola SA, suffered
a setback in its bid to gain influence on the utility’s board as
a court in Bilbao rejected its latest challenge.  ACS had appealed a ruling last year that upheld Iberdrola’s
decision to bar a representative from the construction company
from its board in 2010, according to court documents e-mailed by
Iberdrola. The court threw out the appeal yesterday.  Iberdrola,  Spain ’s biggest electricity utility, denied a
board seat to ACS at its 2010 shareholder meeting, saying ACS’s
power-generation assets made it a competitor. A similar appeal
relating to the 2011 shareholder meeting was rejected earlier
this month.  A spokesman for ACS didn’t respond to a call requesting
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
