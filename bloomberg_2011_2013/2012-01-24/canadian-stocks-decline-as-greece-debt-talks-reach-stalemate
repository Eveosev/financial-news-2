Canadian stocks  fell for the first
time in five days, led by banks, as talks between European
finance ministers and holders of Greek debt reached a stalemate.  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s second-largest lender
by assets, declined 1.1 percent.  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR) ,
the country’s largest railroad, dropped 4.7 percent after
forecasting a smaller earnings increase this year than most
analysts in a Bloomberg survey had estimated. Semiconductor
designer  Gennum Corp. (GND)  soared 119 percent after agreeing to be
bought by Semtech Corp. for about C$500 million ($494 million).  The  S&P/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  slipped 126.46 points, or 1
percent, to 12,395.24 after closing at a four-month high
yesterday.  “The clock is really ticking for the Greeks,” Sebastian van Berkom, a  money manager  at Van Berkom & Associates in
Montreal, said in a telephone interview. The firm oversees about
C$1.7 billion. “If it’s finally confirmed that one of the euro
members actually defaults, the next question is, ‘Who’s next?’”  The index gained 4.7 percent this month through yesterday
as improving employment and manufacturing data in the U.S.
overshadowed the European debt crisis. The S&P/TSX slumped 11
percent in 2011 as concern the crisis would hamper global growth
led to declines in commodity producers’ shares.  European finance ministers refused to increase their offer
of 130 billion euros ($169 billion) in public funds for a second
Greek debt program. They sought to make bondholders accept lower
 interest rates  on new bonds than the investors want.  Streak Ends  The  S&P/TSX Financials Index (STFINL)  declined for the first time in
seven days. TD lost 1.1 percent to C$79.30.  Royal Bank of
Canada (RY) , its bigger rival, slipped 0.9 percent to C$53.79.  Bank
of Nova Scotia (BNS) ,  Canada ’s third-largest lender by assets,
decreased 1.1 percent to C$53.96.  Canadian National retreated 4.7 percent to C$75.86 after
 forecasting  earnings of as much as C$5.32 a share, excluding
certain items, in 2012. Analysts had estimated profit of C$5.39,
according to the average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Gold futures fell after settling at a six-week high
yesterday.  Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the world’s second-biggest gold
producer by market value, dropped 1.8 percent to C$44.85.
Eldorado Gold Corp., Canada’s fifth-largest company in the
industry by market value, declined 2.5 percent to C$13.43.  Barrick Downgrade  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , the world’s largest gold producer, lost
2.8 percent to C$45.95 after Stephen D. Walker, an analyst at
Royal Bank, cut his rating on the shares to “sector perform”
from “outperform.” Walker had had an “outperform” rating on
Barrick since June 2009.  Alacer Gold Corp., which mines in  Turkey , tumbled 12
percent, the most since February 2009, to C$9.64 after issuing a
2012 production forecast that trailed the estimate of David Haughton, an analyst at Bank of  Montreal .  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s biggest
fertilizer producer by market value, decreased 2.2 percent to
C$44.90 after Jeffrey Zekauskas, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase &
Co., reduced his rating on the stock to “neutral” from
“overweight.” In a note to clients, Zekauskas cited the 18
percent gain in the company’s U.S.-traded shares from Dec. 19 to
yesterday and a preference for shares of Agrium Inc.  No More Purchases  Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.,  Rio Tinto  Group’s partner in Mongolia’s
Oyu Tolgoi copper project, slumped 4.2 percent to C$17.53 after
Rio Tinto said it doesn’t plan to buy any more Ivanhoe Mines
shares after increasing its stake in the Vancouver-based company
to 51 percent.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) , which produces base metals
in  Europe , retreated 5.2 percent to C$4.96 after saying it will
take four or five years for its Neves-Corvo project in  Portugal 
to begin production.  Gennum surged 119 percent, the most since at least 1987, to
C$13.45 after Camarillo, California-based Semtech agreed to buy
it for C$13.55 a share. Last month, Sterling Partners bought
Ottawa-based Mosaid Technologies Inc., which licenses
semiconductor patents, for about C$590 million.  Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which develops natural-gas
engine technology, rallied 7.4 percent to C$38.49. U.S.
President  Barack Obama  may call for a goal for natural gas
production in his State of the Union address today, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the
plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
