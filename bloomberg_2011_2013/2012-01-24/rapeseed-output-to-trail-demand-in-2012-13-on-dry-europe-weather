Rapeseed production globally will
trail demand in the 2012-13 marketing year as dry weather in the
European Union and  Ukraine  limits crop prospects, Oil World
said.  Ukraine’s output will fall 19 percent to 1.13 million
metric tons, the Hamburg-based oilseed researcher said today in
a report. That’d be the lowest in five years, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. EU production will gain 4.1 percent to
19.9 million tons after producers harvested the least in three
years in 2011-12, Oil World said. The EU will have to import
more to meet demand, according to the report.  “An unusually large share of the planted winter rapeseed
did not germinate well and will be abandoned, primarily in
Ukraine,” Oil World said today. Dry weather “will keep EU
import requirements of rapeseed and canola very high in the
2012-13 season.”  Rapeseed futures on ICE Futures  Canada  in Winnipeg have
declined 12 percent in the past year. Output in Canada, the
single-largest grower of canola, will gain 3.8 percent to 14.7
million tons, Oil World said.  World production of rapeseed and canola, a low-acid variety
of the oilseed, may total 61.5 million tons in the 2012-13
marketing year, up 3.4 percent from the prior 12 months, the
first increase in three years, Oil World said. Because of small
opening stockpiles, which are down 20 percent to 5.1 million
tons, total supply of rapeseed will lag consumption, the
researcher said.  “Considering the current poor winter rapeseed crop
conditions in Ukraine and the sizable decline in winter rapeseed
plantings in the EU-27 as well as the prospective low world
stocks of rapeseed and canola in June and July 2012, a further
increase in Canadian canola production will be required to
satisfy demand in 2012,” the researcher said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
