Oil fluctuated in  New York , failing
to extend yesterdayâ€™s gain, as speculation U.S. supplies rose
last week countered concern Iran will respond to a European ban
on its crude exports by shutting the Strait of Hormuz.  Crude for March delivery was little changed at $99.61 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:37 p.m. in Sydney. The contract earlier rose as much as 40
cents to $99.98. Futures yesterday rose $1.25 to $99.58, the
highest since Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
