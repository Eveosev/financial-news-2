Japan ’s bond futures may fall to the
lowest level since December after forming a “dead cross,”
Mizuho Investors Securities Co. said, citing trading patterns.
　　     A dead cross is created when a short-term moving average
drops below a longer-term one, signaling prices may continue to
slide. The five-day average for benchmark 10-year bond futures
fell below the 20- and 90-day lines yesterday, when the contract
for March delivery declined 0.10 to 142.14.
　　     Should the lead contract break below support at about
141.98, it will approach the Dec. 1 low of 141.52, said  Akihiko Inoue , chief strategist at Mizuho Investors Securities, a unit
of Japan’s third-largest bank by market value. Support is where
buy orders may be clustered.
　　     “With the contract also falling below the bottom of the
cloud on the ichimoku chart,” futures may stay low, Inoue said.
　　     An ichimoku chart analyzes the midpoints of historic highs
and lows. The cloud refers to the area between the first and
second leading-span lines on the chart and is used to show an
area where buy orders may be clustered.
