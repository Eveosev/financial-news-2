Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Citigroup Inc. sold $1 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds in
the year’s first offering, according to people familiar with the
deal.  The top-ranked portion maturing in about 10 years yields
120 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate, said the
people, who declined to be identified because terms aren’t
public. Securities rated BBB-, the lowest investment-grade
ranking, yield 790 basis points more than the benchmark, the
people said.  The deal is the first since banks pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds in July as  Europe ’s debt crisis
roiled credit markets and sent spreads soaring. Originations
have since picked up, according to a  Standard & Poor’s  report
last month. The ratings company is forecasting $35 billion in
2012 sales.  The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries has declined to
2.3 percentage points as of yesterday from 2.61 percentage
points at the end of December, according to the Barclays Capital
CMBS AAA Super Duper Index.  Relative yields on commercial mortgage bonds determine how
attractive Wall Street rates are for property owners and drive
the velocity of new offerings. Sales of the debt reached a
record $234 billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show. Issuance
tumbled to $12.2 billion in 2008 as credit markets seized. The
market stayed shut until November 2009. Banks arranged $28
billion in 2011, compared with $11.5 billion in 2010, Bloomberg
data show.  The spread on top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds was as
narrow as 60 basis points more than Treasuries when sales peaked
in 2007, and as wide as 14.92 percentage points in November 200
in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
