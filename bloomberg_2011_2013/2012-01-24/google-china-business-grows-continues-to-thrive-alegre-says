Google (GOOG)  Inc.’s business in China is
growing and “continues to thrive” amid demand for advertising
services in the world’s most populous country, said Daniel Alegre, president of the company’s Asia-Pacific operations.  Google ran afoul of Chinese authorities in 2010 for
refusing to abide by local censorship rules. Amid the clash, the
company shuttered its unfiltered search tools in China and
instead began redirecting users to pages in Hong Kong.  Still, the company is focusing on products that are “non-
sensitive” in China market, Alegre said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. Google is seeing strong demand for
advertising with its mobile and desktop services, he said.  “We never left  China , and we continue to believe in the
market,” Alegre said. “It’s a very vibrant Internet market. We
have some of the best employees at Google and we continue to
grow not only our revenue but also our headcount in the
country.”  Google, looking to grow beyond markets in the U.S. and
Western Europe, aims to expand in China after losing search
market share to  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  China is the largest Internet market
by users.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, was little
changed at $585.52 yesterday in  New York . The stock  climbed  8.7
percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
