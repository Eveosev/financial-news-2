Gasoline barge prices rose after
Petroplus Holdings AG,  Europe ’s largest independent refiner,
said it plans to file for insolvency. The company’s Coryton
plant in the U.K. was running at about 115,000 barrels a day,
according to a Petroplus official.  Gasoil gained on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  for immediate loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp traded at $962 and $967 a metric ton, according to a
survey of brokers and traders monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board. That compares with deals at $963 and $964 yesterday.  Gunvor Group Ltd. was the main buyer with a purchase of
8,000 tons, while Cargill Inc. bought 2,000 tons. Statoil ASA,
Total ASA, Chevron Corp. and Morgan Stanley sold the Eurobob
grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , climbed to
$5.65 a barrel from $5.54 yesterday, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined products broker in London.
Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent widened to $6.10 a barrel from $5.55
the previous session, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February advanced 0.5 percent to $941.50 a ton
at 12:42 p.m. local time on the ICE exchange. The March contract
gained 0.4 percent to $943. That reduced the front-month
contract’s premium to $1.50 from $2.50 yesterday.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
increased to $16.32 a barrel from $15.59 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday.
Front-month Brent declined 0.3 percent to $110.28 a barrel on
the ICE exchange.  Refineries  Petroplus will seek to ensure that operations are “safely
shut down and to preserve value for all stakeholders,”
according to a statement today. Only two of the company’s five
European refineries are operating after its credit lines were
suspended last month. The plants at Coryton and Ingolstad,
 Germany , are running at reduced capacity.  Coryton (BPCOCRUD)  is processing at about half of its 220,000 barrel-
a-day capacity, said a company official declined to be
identified because he isn’t authorized to speak to the media,
said in a telephone interview. The refinery is producing about
100,000 metric tons of ultra-low-sulfur diesel a month and
60,000 to 70,000 tons of jet fuel, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
