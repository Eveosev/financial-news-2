Amnesty International urged  Sudan  to
release student activist Taj Alsir Jaafa, who participated in a
protest at the University of Khartoum in support of people
displaced by the  Merowe Dam , north of Khartoum.  Jaafa, 25, was arrested by security forces in Khartoum on
Dec. 30 while travelling on a bus from the university to his
home, London-based Amnesty said today in an e-mailed statement,
citing witnesses. His mother, who was told on Jan. 18 that he
was being held by the state security police, has been threatened
by plain-clothed individuals, it said.  “He is being held incommunicado at an unknown location,
and is at risk of torture or other ill-treatment,” Amnesty
International said.  At least 73 students were arrested last month during the
protest, students said. Jaafar is a coordinator for the
opposition The Movement of New Democratic Forces party at the
university. He was previously detained in 2009, when he was
allegedly tortured, and in 2011,  Amnesty International  said. He
was released without charge on both occasions, according to the
statement.  “The police has nothing to do with this incident,” al-Ser
Ahmed Omar, a police spokesman, said today by phone from
Khartoum. “We never arrest students and we never use violence
against students.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
