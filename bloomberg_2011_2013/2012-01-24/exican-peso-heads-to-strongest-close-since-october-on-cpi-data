Mexico ’s peso strengthened the most
in three days after higher-than-forecast inflation in the Latin
American country damped speculation policy makers may cut
 interest rates .  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 13.0998 per  U.S. dollar  at
the close in Mexico City, from 13.1685 yesterday. The currency
has appreciated 6.4 percent this year.  Mexico’s national statistics agency said consumer prices
rose 0.32 percent in the first half of January, compared with
the median forecast of 16 analysts in a Bloomberg survey for a
0.24 percent increase. The statistics agency known as Inegi said
core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 0.2 percent during
the period, compared with a median forecast of 0.15 percent from
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  While it’s not enough to “justify a recalibration of
monetary policy,” the peso is rising on the inflation numbers,
Aryam Vazquez, an emerging-markets economist at  Wells Fargo &
Co ., said in a telephone interview from New York. “What it does
show is that Mexico is unlikely to cut rates any time soon.”  Mexico’s central bank left the benchmark lending rate at a
record low 4.5 percent on Jan. 20, matching forecasts from all
20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, and said the recent jump in
consumer prices wasn’t a reflection of  core inflation .  Mexico’s economy grew 3.75 percent in November from a year
earlier, according to the statistics agency’s proxy for gross
domestic product released today on its website. Economists
expected an expansion of 3.55 percent, according to the median
estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.33
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the securities rose 0.12 centavo to 132.29 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
