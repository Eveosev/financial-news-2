The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:08 p.m. local time.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 0.2 percent to 13,547.20, while the
Colcap Index fell 0.4 percent to 1,602.95.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA)  (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
Colombia’s largest airline, rose 2.5 percent to 3,695 pesos.  The company said it had 1.9 million passengers in December,
a 12 percent gain from a year ago.  Banco Davivienda SA (PFDVVND)  (PFDAVVND CB), Colombia’s third-biggest
bank, fell 1.1 percent to 20,460 pesos.  HSBC Holdings Plc will sell banking operations in  Costa
Rica ,  El Salvador  and  Honduras  to Davivienda for $801 million in
cash, the bank said in a statement.  “Those banks don’t generate a lot of profits so the return
on equity may be small,” said David Pelaez, an analyst at Bolsa
y Renta SA in Medellin. Combined profit at the three banks in
2011 was about $18 million, according to regulatory filings.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA  (BVC CB), the operator of
 Colombia ’s main stock exchange, rose 0.4 percent to 28.2 pesos.
Investors may be speculating that record Colombian share sales
boosted the company’s profit last year, according to an e-mailed
report from Celfin Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
