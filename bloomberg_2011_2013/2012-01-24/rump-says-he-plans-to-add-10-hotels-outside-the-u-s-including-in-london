Donald Trump  plans to add hotels in
large cities outside the U.S., including  London , he said today.  “We have at least 10 deals we’re working on,” Trump said
during a press conference at the Americas Lodging Investment
Summit in Los Angeles. “We’re looking primarily in major
cities.” He declined to give additional details about the
planned hotels.  The developer and reality-television star plans to fund
construction and acquisitions with cash as borrowing from banks
proves difficult. Trump said he doesn’t expect a recovery in
real estate development until lenders finance projects again.  “They’re just not there for your hotel projects,” Trump,
65, said during a keynote speech at the conference earlier in
the day. “We have a good cash position, but banks won’t give us
any money for any jobs we want to do.”  Private-equity companies are likely to fill the financing
gap for hotel acquisitions, he said.  “They are in to buy, not for development,” Trump said.
“The banks are key. They have to step it up.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
