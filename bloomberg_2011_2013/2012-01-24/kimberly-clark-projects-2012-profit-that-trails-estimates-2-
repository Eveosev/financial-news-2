Kimberly-Clark Corp. (KMB) , the maker of
Kleenex tissues, reported an 18 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit and projected full-year earnings that trailed analysts’
estimates, hurt by slowing demand in developed markets.  Adjusted profit for 2012 will be $5 to $5.15, the Dallas-
based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected
$5.24, the average of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Falk said the company
expects difficult economic conditions this year, particularly in
developed markets, adding that foreign currency exchange rates
will also be a “headwind.”  Net income in the fourth quarter fell to $401 million, or
$1.01 a share, from $492 million, or $1.20, a year ago, the
company said today in the statement. Excluding some items,
profit was $1.28 a share. The average of 13 analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was profit of $1.30.  The company in October cut the high end of its 2011 profit
 forecast , citing lower demand in  North America  and some
developed markets during the third quarter.  Kimberly-Clark  fell  1.7 percent to $72.27 at the close in
 New York . The shares gained 17 percent in 2011.  Low birthrates and consumers opting for cheaper brands hurt
sales in developed markets, the company said on a conference
call today. Kimberly-Clark is expanding categories such as baby
wipes overseas to help counter the smaller number of births,
Falk said in an interview today.  Health care, where fourth-quarter revenue grew 10 percent,
is a “big growth opportunity,” and Kimberly-Clark will
consider more “tuck-in acquisitions” in the unit, Falk said.  Diversifying into sectors such as health care helps the
company, which faces price pressure from larger  Procter & Gamble
Co . and stores’ private label brands, said  Jack Russo , an
analyst at Edward Jones & Co. in  St. Louis .  To contact the reporter on this story:
