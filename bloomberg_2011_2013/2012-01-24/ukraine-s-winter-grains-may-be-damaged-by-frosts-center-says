Ukraine’s winter grain plants may be
damaged by freezing temperatures in the east and south during a
10-day period starting tomorrow, according to the national
meteorology center.  “It is going to be the longest wave of cold this year,”
Tetiana Adamenko, head of the national weather center’s agro-
meteorology department, said in a phone interview in Kiev today.  Temperatures may fall to as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius
(minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit) and remain there for as many as
three to five days in Luhansk, threatening grain plants in
certain areas, Adamenko said. Fields in the Kharkiv and Sumy
regions in the eastern part of Ukraine may also be affected, she
said.  Ukraine planted winter grains, most of which is winter
wheat, on 8.4 million hectares (20.8 million acres), or 3.8
percent more than a year ago, according to the state statistics
committee. Around 7.1 million hectares of planted areas had
sprouts as of Jan. 19, the country’s agriculture ministry said
on its  website  this week.  Flurries in the past week formed a protective snow pack in
most of the country, with the exception of eastern and southern
parts, Adamenko said.  “Everything will depend on the snow pack, on how low
temperatures drop and for how many days,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
