The cost of insuring against default
on European financial debt rose, according to traders of credit-
default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers jumped 10.5 basis points to 234.5 and the
subordinated index was 16 higher at 419, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 2 p.m. in London. An increase signals
deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 5.5
basis points to 640. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings rose four basis points
to 152.5 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments increased four basis points to 331.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13 million) of debt from default for five years
is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face
value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
