South Africa , the continent’s
largest corn producer, may plant 11 percent more land with the
grain this season after prices increased.  Plantings may expand to 2.63 million hectares (6.5 million
acres) from 2.37 million hectares, Marda Scheepers, an official
at the government’s Crop Estimates Committee, said by phone from
 Pretoria  today. That compares with the 2.57 million-hectare
median estimate of nine traders surveyed by Bloomberg Jan. 19.  “The reason for the advance is an increase in prices
compared with the same period a year ago,” Scheepers said.
“We’ve seen a decrease in the area planted with sorghum as
farmers switched to corn.”  White-corn prices have risen 38 percent over the past six
months on the South African Futures Exchange. The grain for
March delivery closed at 2,686 rand ($337) a metric ton today.  Farmers may sow 48,000 hectares with sorghum, 31 percent
less than last season. Dry-bean plantings will probably fall by
11 percent to 37,200 hectares, while sunflower-seed plantings
may shrink by 20 percent to 515,000 hectares, the committee’s
forecasts show.  The committee expects soybean plantings to expand by 15
percent to 480,000 hectares this season, and groundnut plantings
to fall by 17 percent to 46,000 hectares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
