Gold prices dropped the most in a
week as the dollar rebounded from a two-week low, reducing
demand for the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The greenback rose as much as 0.5 percent against a basket
of currencies after European policy makers and Greek bondholders
failed to reach agreement on a debt-swap plan. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities declined as much as 1 percent.  “The markets are taking a hit because everyone was
expecting Greece to come up with a plan,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “People are largely in a ‘risk-
off’ mode today.”  Gold futures for February delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,664.50 an ounce at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest decline for a most-active contract since Jan.
13. Yesterday, the metal reached $1,681.80, the highest since
Dec. 12.  Gold “may be vulnerable to profit-taking, with physical
buying reduced due to Chinese holidays,”  James Moore , an
analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report.  Financial markets in Asian countries including China and
 South Korea  were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday.  In gold options, the most-actively traded contracts were
February $1,650 puts at 1,324 lots as of 2:33 p.m.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$31.975 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 0.6 percent to $1,552.40 an ounce. Palladium
futures for March delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $680.55 an
ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
