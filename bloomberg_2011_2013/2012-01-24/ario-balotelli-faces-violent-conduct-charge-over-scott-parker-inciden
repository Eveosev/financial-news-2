English soccer’s governing body
charged Manchester City striker  Mario Balotelli  with violent
conduct following an incident in the team’s 3-2 win over
Tottenham Hotspur two days ago.  Balotelli, who had already been booked for a foul on Benoit
Assou-Ekotto, appeared to strike Spurs midfielder  Scott Parker 
on the head with his boot about 10 minutes before the end of the
match at City’s Etihad Stadium.  Balotelli wasn’t punished by referee Howard Webb and went
on to score the winning goal from the penalty spot four minutes
into second-half stoppage time. Spurs manager  Harry Redknapp 
told reporters the 21-year-old Italian of Ghanaian descent
should have been red-carded.  “The first (stamp) could be an accident, but the second
one? He’s back-heeled him straight in the head,” Redknapp said.
“I don’t like people kicking people in the head on a football
pitch.”  Balotelli faces a four-match suspension if found guilty
having already been red-carded earlier this season, the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported. He has until 6 p.m. U.K. time on
Jan. 25 to respond to the charge,  the F.A. said  in a statement.
An unsuccessful appeal could result in a longer suspension, the
 BBC  said.  A four-match ban may rule him out of tomorrow’s Carling Cup
semifinal second leg at Liverpool, where City needs to overcome
a 1-0 deficit from the opening game to reach the final, and
Premier League matches against Everton, Fulham and Aston Villa.
City has a three-point lead atop the standings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
