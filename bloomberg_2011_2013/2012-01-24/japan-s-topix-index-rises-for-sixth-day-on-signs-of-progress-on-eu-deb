Japanese  stocks  edged up, sending
the  Topix (TPX)  Index up for a sixth day, as proposals from European
Union finance ministers to tame the debt crisis reassured
investors, boosting the outlook for Asian exporters.  Nintendo Co., a Japanese maker of video-game consoles that
gets more than a third of its sales in Europe, rose 1.5 percent
after the euro gained against the yen.  Inpex Corp. (1605) ,  Japan ’s top
oil explorer, climbed 2.2 percent after crude prices advanced.
 Nippon Steel Corp. (5401)  led the sector downward, sinking 3 percent
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the company’s target price.  The Topix, Japan’s broadest equity gauge, added 0.1 percent
to 757.40 at the 3 p.m. close in  Tokyo , its longest winning
streak since September. About three stocks declined for every
two that gained. The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.2 percent
to 8,785.33.  “The worst scenario that  Greece  will break away from the
euro region is gone, easing excessive worries about the European
debt issues,” said  Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-
based SMBC Friend Securities Co. “Globally, a feeling of
confidence to buy stocks is emerging.”  The  Topix (TPX)  tumbled 19 percent last year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.9 times book value. That compares with 2.1 times for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in the U.S. and 1.4 times for the
Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.3 percent
today. The measure added 0.1 percent in New York yesterday,
rising for a fifth day, as energy and finance shares advanced
and investors weighed developments in Europe’s efforts to tackle
its debt.  Euro Bailout Fund  Euro-area finance ministers agreed yesterday on the
region’s permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism,
based on a proposal by Finland. A government official in Berlin
said  Germany  may be open to combining Europe’s two bailout
mechanisms and boosting their funding limit.  Japanese stocks fluctuated after European finance ministers
today balked at putting up more public money for Greece, seeking
to fill a deeper-than-expected Greek financing hole by saddling
investors with a lower  interest rate  on exchanged bonds.  “Investors are in wait-and-see stance on the Greek
issue,” said  Yoshinori Nagano , a　senior strategist in Tokyo at
Daiwa Asset Management Co., which　oversees about $104 billion.  Exporters Climb  The 17-country currency strengthened, lifting shares of
exporters to Europe. Nintendo rose 1.5 percent to 10,760 yen.
 Kyocera Corp. (6971) , an electronics maker that gets almost a fifth of
its sales in Europe, climbed 0.6 percent to 6,550 yen.  The euro appreciated to as high as 100.49 yen today in
Tokyo, compared with 99.34 at the close of stock trading
yesterday, boosting the value of some overseas income at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  “The euro is strengthening above 100 yen, which may appeal
to investors” in Japanese exporters’ stocks, said Daiwa Asset
Management’s Nagano.  Inpex gained 2.2 percent to 517,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-largest oil explorer by
market value, rose 1.4 percent to 3,380 yen.  Oil yesterday rose for the first time in four days after
the European Union agreed to ban crude imports from Iran,
raising concern that retaliation from the Islamic republic may
disrupt the oil supply in the  Middle East . Crude for March
delivery climbed 1.3 percent to settle at $99.58 a barrel in  New
York  yesterday.  Elpida Advances  Elpida Memory Inc. advanced 4.6 percent to 367 yen after a
report the chipmaker is in merger talks with Micron Technology
Inc. and Nanya Technology Corp, the Yomiuri newspaper said,
without citing a source. The paper also reported Elpida needs 92
billion yen ($1.2 billion) to repay loans and bonds due as early
as March.  “The report isn’t factual,” the chipmaker said in a
statement today.  Steelmakers declined the most in the 33 Topix industry
groups today. Sector leader Nippon Steel sank 3 percent to 197
yen after JPMorgan Chase trimmed its price estimate to 240 yen
from 250 yen, saying earnings are likely to be pressured by
deteriorating profit on exports and domestic products.  JFE
Holdings Inc. (5411)  fell 1.1 percent to 1,444 yen after its target
price was also cut by the investment bank.  Sony Corp. (6758)  was  the biggest drag  in the Topix among its
1,660 members, falling 2.4 percent to 1,388 yen after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the electronics maker offered to buy as much
as 30 percent of scandal-hit Olympus Corp. as part of a proposed
business alliance.  To contact the reporters on this story:
