U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
fluctuated as the difference between West Texas Intermediate and
Brent was little changed.  The premium of Brent to WTI decreased 12 cents to $10.88 at
12:07 p.m. in  New York , based on the contracts for March
delivery, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI gained 50 cents to $11 a barrel at 11:51 a.m.  Heavy
Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  decreased 35 cents to $12.15 over the U.S.
benchmark.  Thunder Horse’s premium narrowed 25 cents to $11. Mars
Blend increased 5 cents to $8.35 over WTI.  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium
rose 10 cents to $8.25.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  increased 20 cents to $7.25 over WTI.
 West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 65 cents to $2.50 a barrel.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount was unchanged at $3.20 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$21 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
