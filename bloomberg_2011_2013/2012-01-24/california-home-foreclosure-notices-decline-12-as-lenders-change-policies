Foreclosure notices in California,
the state with the highest number of distressed mortgages, fell
in the fourth quarter as the housing market improved and loan
servicers changed their policies, DataQuick said.  A total of 61,517 notices of  default  were recorded in the
three months ended Dec. 31, down 12 percent from a year earlier
and 14 percent from the previous quarter, the San Diego-based
real estate information provider said today.  “We are certainly seeing a lower level of foreclosure
activity than a year or two ago,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the statement. “The question is, how much of that
decline is due to market conditions, and how much is due to
policy changes that try to address economic distress and lower
home values?”  Sales involving homes with delinquent mortgages increased
last month as lenders pushed to “move them off their balance
sheets before the end of the year,” according to a report today
by the  California Association of Realtors . Short sales, in which
lenders let homeowners sell for less than the mortgage balances,
accounted for 22.2 percent of December transactions, up from 21
percent in November. Bank-owned homes made up 24.6 percent of
deals, up from 23.5 percent in November.  A total of 37,734 new and resale houses and condominiums
sold in  California  in December, up 16 percent from the previous
month and 4.2 percent from a year earlier, DataQuick reported
Jan. 18. Foreclosure filings dropped in late 2010, when lenders
faced investigations over accusations they had used improper
documentation to seize homes with delinquent mortgages.  Foreclosure Sales  Last year, 428,045 California homes received foreclosure
filings, accounting for 23 percent of all homes nationwide with
a notice of default, auction notice or  foreclosure sale ,
RealtyTrac Inc. reported Jan. 12.  Most of the California loans going into default in the
fourth quarter were originated between 2005 and 2007, when home
values were at their peak and lenders loosened credit terms,
according to today’s DataQuick report. California foreclosure
filings peaked in the first quarter of 2009, when 135,431 homes
received notices of default, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
