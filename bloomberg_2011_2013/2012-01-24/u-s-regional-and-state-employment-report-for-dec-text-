December. Thirty-seven states and the  District of Columbia 
recorded unemployment rate decreases, 3 states posted rate
increases, and 10 states had no rate change, the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics reported today. Forty-six states registered
unemployment rate decreases from a year earlier, while four
states and the District of Columbia experienced increases. The
national jobless rate, 8.5 percent, continued to trend down in
December and was 0.9 percentage point lower than in December
2010.  In December, nonfarm payroll employment increased in 25 states
and the District of Columbia, decreased in 24 states, and was
unchanged in 1 state. The largest over-the-month increase in
employment occurred in  Texas  (+20,200), followed by  Indiana 
(+15,100) and California (+10,700). The largest over-the-month
decrease in employment occurred in  New York  (-14,000), followed

experienced the largest over-the-month percentage increase in
employment (+1.1 percent), followed by  North Dakota  (+0.9
percent) and Indiana,  Kentucky , and  Utah  (+0.5 percent each).
 Nevada  experienced the largest over-the-month percentage decline
in employment (-0.9 percent), followed by  Alaska  (-0.5 percent)
and Maine, Missouri, and Washington (-0.4 percent each). Over
the year, nonfarm employment increased in 46 states and the
District of Columbia and decreased in 4 states. The largest
over-the-year percentage increase occurred in North Dakota (+5.7

rate in December, 9.7 percent, while the Midwest and Northeast
reported the lowest rates, 7.9 percent each. Three regions
experienced statistically significant over-the-month
unemployment rate changes: the Midwest and South (-0.3
percentage point each) and the West (-0.2 point). Over the year,
all four regions registered significant rate decreases, the
largest of which was in the West (-1.3 percentage points). (See
table 1.)  Among the nine geographic divisions, the Pacific continued to
report the highest jobless rate, 10.4 percent in December. The
West North Central again registered the lowest rate, 6.1 percent.
Six divisions experienced statistically significant unemployment
rate decreases over the month. The largest of these occurred in
the East South Central (-0.4 percentage point). Seven divisions
recorded significant rate declines from a year earlier, the
largest of which was in the Pacific (-1.3 percentage points). No
division reported an unemployment rate increase from December
2010.  State Unemployment (Seasonally Adjusted)  Nevada continued to record the highest unemployment rate among
the states, 12.6 percent in December.  California  posted the next
highest rate, 11.1 percent. North Dakota again registered the
lowest jobless rate, 3.3 percent, followed by  Nebraska  and South
Dakota, 4.1 and 4.2 percent, respectively. Twenty-four states
reported jobless rates significantly lower than the U.S. figure
of 8.5 percent, 8 states and the District of Columbia had
measurably higher rates, and 18 states had rates that were not
appreciably different from that of the nation.  Eighteen states experienced statistically significant over-the-
month unemployment rate declines in December. The largest of
these were in  Alabama  (-0.6 percentage point) and  Michigan  (-0.5
point). The remaining 32 states and the District of Columbia
recorded jobless rates that were not measurably different from
those of a month earlier, though some had changes that were at
least as large numerically as the significant changes.  Nevada registered the largest jobless rate decrease from
December 2010 (-2.3 percentage points). Twenty-one additional
states reported smaller but also statistically significant
decreases over the year. The remaining 28 states and the
District of Columbia recorded unemployment rates that were not
appreciably different from those of a year earlier.  Nonfarm Payroll Employment (Seasonally Adjusted)  In December, eight states recorded statistically significant
