The Czech central bank should
increase interest rates if inflation continues to exceed central
bank forecasts,  Reuters  reported, citing policy maker  Eva
Zamrazilova .  Zamrazilova probably wonâ€™t vote for higher rates at the
Feb. 2 policy meeting without the support of other board
members, though she will back policy tightening in March if the
January inflation rate is above forecasts by the central bank
and the market, Reuters cited Zamrazilova as saying in an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
