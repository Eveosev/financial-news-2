The  European Investment Bank  is
adding at least 1 billion euros to its existing 3 billion-euro
issue of 2.5 percent bonds due in October 2018, according to a
banker involved in the transaction.  The new securities may be priced to yield about 65 basis
points more than the swap rate, the banker said. The bond tap is
being managed by JPMorgan Chase & Co., Royal Bank of Canada,
Societe Generale SA and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , and is due to be
completed this week, the banker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
