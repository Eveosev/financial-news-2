The number of  foreign tourists 
visiting  Turkey  rose 2.5 percent in December from a year earlier.  About 1.19 million visitors arrived in the month, up from
1.17 million in the same month of 2010, the Tourism Ministry in
Ankara said on its website today.  For the full year, visitors rose 9.9 percent to 31.5
million, the ministry said. Arrivals rose every month and jumped
as much as 31 percent in April as operators diverted tours to
Turkey after the uprisings in north  Africa .  Income from tourism in the third quarter climbed 9 percent
from a year earlier to $9.3 billion, the statistics agency said
on Oct. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
