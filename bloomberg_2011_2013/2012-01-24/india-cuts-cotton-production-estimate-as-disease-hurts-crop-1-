Cotton production in  India , the
second-biggest grower, will be lower than earlier forecast after
diseases cut yields in the states of Maharashtra and  Andhra
Pradesh , said the nation’s textiles commissioner.  The harvest may reach 34.5 million bales of 170 kilograms
(375 pounds) each in the year that began Oct. 1, against 35.6
million bales estimated on Nov. 15, Textiles Commissioner A.B. Joshi told reporters in Mumbai after a meeting of the Cotton
Advisory Board. India produced 32.5 million bales in 2010-2011.  A smaller-than-expected crop may lower stockpiles in the
country as exports increase and demand improves from domestic
textile mills, boosting prices and raising costs for garment
makers such as  Arvind Ltd. (ARVND)  and  Gokaldas Exports Ltd. (GEXP)  Cotton
futures increased 8.2 percent in  New York  this year after
plunging 37 percent in 2011, the most in seven years.  “New crop arrivals have been lower so far, which means
production may be only marginally better than last year,” D.K. Nair, secretary-general of the Confederation of Indian Textiles
Industry, said by phone. “Local prices will rise as ending
stocks may come down because of higher exports.”  Output in Maharashtra may be 6.9 million bales, 19 percent
below the 8.5 million bales estimated in November, while
production in Andhra Pradesh may decline 13 percent to 4.8
million bales, Joshi said. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are
the second- and third-largest growers after Gujarat.  China  Demand  Indian cotton prices, which climbed to a record 63,000
rupees ($1,260) per candy (356 kilograms) in February last year,
have fallen to 36,500 rupees as of Jan. 20, according to the
 Cotton Association of India.   The export estimate was increased to 8.4 million bales from
8 million bales predicted in November, Joshi said. India
exported 7 million bales last year. Around 88 percent of the 4.4
million bales shipped so far have been to China, he said.  “China is buying a lot of cotton for its buffer
requirement,” according to Nair from the textile confederation.  Demand for cotton from textile mills may climb to 24
million bales from 23 million bales estimated earlier, Joshi
said. Stockpiles will be 5.5 million bales by Sept. 30, he said.
That’s lower than the 7.8 million bales estimated in November,
according to the textile confederation.  “Mill usage will rise as yarn prices have started looking
up in the last one month, while cotton prices have been
stable,” Joshi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
