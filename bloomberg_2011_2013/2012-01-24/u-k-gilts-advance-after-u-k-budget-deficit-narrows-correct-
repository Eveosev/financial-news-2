The pound rose against all but one
of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg as a report showed
the U.K. budget deficit shrank more than economists predicted in
December, boosting the nation’s status as a haven.  U.K. 30-year gilts outperformed German bonds as  Bank of
England  policy maker  Adam Posen  said officials were ready to
expand their debt-purchase program should growth and inflation
forecasts provide justification. The U.K. sold 4.75 billion
pounds ($7.4 billion) of 2052 gilts through banks after
receiving orders worth 12.4 billion pounds, the Debt Management
Office said. Sterling rose the most against the Japanese yen.  “The public-sector finances data today came in better than
expected on a monthly basis, and that supports the relative
safety of the pound,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The U.K.
economic outlook, on its own, doesn’t look promising, but at
least the government shows it’s committed to improving the
country’s fiscal positions.”  The  pound  jumped 1.2 percent to 121.30 yen and strengthened
0.3 percent to 83.38 pence per euro as of 5:04 p.m.  London  time.
It rose 0.2 percent to $1.5595.  Sterling has fallen 0.9 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar dropped 1.2 percent, and
the euro declined 0.9 percent.  The 30-year yield dropped one basis point to 3.14 percent
after falling to 3.11 percent. The 4.25 percent security due in
December 2040 advanced 0.24, or 2.4 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 120.875. The extra yield that investors demand for
holding 30-year gilts instead of the equivalent German bonds
fell four basis points to 51 basis points.  Budget Deficit  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points 2.18 percent,
within two basis points of the highest this year. Two-year note
yields also advanced two basis points, to 0.45 percent.  U.K.  net borrowing  excluding support for banks was 13.7
billion pounds in December, compared with 15.9 billion pounds a
year earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said today.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast 14.9 billion pounds,
according to a median estimate.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  has pledged to
stick to his spending plan as European nations struggling to
tame deficits see their credit ratings lowered. Net debt rose
above 1 trillion pounds last month for the first time since
records began in 1993.  ‘Significant Challenge’  The country’s debt as percentage of its gross domestic
product, currently at around 76 percent, is likely to rise over
the next three years, breaching the “critical” 90 percent
before declining, according to  Barclays Capital .  “This highlights the fact that the government still has a
significant challenge ahead if it is to put a brake on the rapid
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and achieve its target of
starting to cut this ratio by 2015-2016,” Barclays economist
Blerina Uruci wrote in an e-mailed note today. “Although not
under immediate threat, the U.K.’s triple A rating is far from
assured.”  The U.K. sold the 3.75 percent bonds due in 2052 at a yield
spread two basis points above that of 2049 gilts, the Debt
Management Office said. As a result of today’s sale, a so-called
mini-tender operation planned for the week starting Feb. 27 was
canceled, the debt agency said on its website.  The sale saw “strong demand and that’s positive for
gilts,” said  Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at  RBC Capital
Markets  in London.  Gilt Returns  The syndicated deal is part of 178.9 billion pounds of
gilts the debt agency plans to sell in the fiscal year that ends
in March to finance the deficit and repay maturing securities.  The 10-year break-even rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations derived from the yield difference between regular
and index-linked bonds, fell five basis points to 2.69
percentage points.  Gilts handed investors a 1.1 percent loss this year, after
earning 17 percent in 2011, including reinvested interest,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds fell
0.9 percent in 2012, with U.S. Treasuries 0.7 percent lower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
