Chile ’s peso retreated from a four-
month high as the price of copper slid and a stalemate over
Greek debt sapped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso plunged 0.8 percent to 491.88 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 9:53 a.m. in Santiago from 488.16 yesterday, the highest
close since Sept. 19.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports,
declined as much as 1.3 percent and the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of
equities headed for its first drop in seven days after European
finance ministers balked at putting up more money for  Greece  and
called on bondholders to provide more debt relief.  “That’s hit the peso and emerging currencies today,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Inversiones in Santiago.
“We’ve come from 526 pesos per dollar so 488 to 490 is a good
place to pause, although the big battalions still seem to be
selling dollars, so rebounds will be marginal.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
trimmed their short position in the currency to $4.4 billion on
Jan. 20, the lowest since Dec. 9, according to central bank
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
