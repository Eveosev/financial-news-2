Cosco Pacific Ltd (1199) ’s  Piraeus
Container Terminal SA , which operates Pier II at Greece’s
largest port, registered a 73 percent increase in container
traffic in 2011,  Kathimerini  reported, citing data from the
company.  PCT handled 1.18 million so-called twenty-foot-equivalent
units last year, up from 684,000 in 2010, making the container
pier the most important of Cosco-controlled European terminals,
the Athens-based newspaper said.  Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA)  got 19.7 million euros in fixed
and variable revenue from Cosco in the nine months to Sept. 30
for the concession to run Pier II and a future Pier III, up from
17.2 million euros a year earlier, the port operator said in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
