Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the world’s biggest
investor in wind parks, will spend 2.6 billion pounds ($3.4
billion) upgrading its U.K. electricity grid to handle more
power from turbines and curb power costs to consumers.  The investment plan undertaken through its unit Scottish
Power Ltd. will allow for grid upgrades to connect about 11
gigawatts more wind energy on land and sea in Scotland,
Iberdrola said today in a filing. That’s enough power for about
6 million homes, according to Glasgow-based Scottish Power.  The  power lines  expansion will double Scottish Power’s
export capacity from Scotland to  England  to 7 gigawatts by 2021,
according to Iberdrola. The U.K.’s target to get 15 percent of
energy from low-carbon sources by 2020 means power links need to
be improved to transport energy produced at remote wind farms on
land or offshore to consumers.  Scotland  plans to get all its
electricity from renewables by 2020.  Iberdrola’s proposal, which was fast-tracked for approval
by U.K. energy regulator Ofgem, will create 1,500 Scottish jobs
and reduce costs to the U.K. consumer by 1.7 billion pounds by
2021, according to the filing.  The upgrades to the network in central and southern
Scotland are the most important in more than 50 years, Scottish
Power said in a separate  statement  on its website. They will
replace about 800 kilometers (500 miles) of overhead power lines
and 15 percent of the existing electricity substations,
according to the company.  The plan will also increase the book value of Scottish
Power’s electricity transportation network by 220 percent to 3.2
billion pounds, Iberdrola said. About 10 pence a year will be
added to the customer’s annual bill as a result of the plan,
according to Iberdrola.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
