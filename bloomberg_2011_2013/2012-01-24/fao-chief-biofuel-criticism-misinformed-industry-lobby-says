Criticism of biofuels and their
impact on commodity prices by the new director general of the
 United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization  is
“simplistic and misinformed,” an industry lobby said.  Higher energy prices are the “primary driver” for
increased costs of commodities including corn and sugar, Bliss
Baker, a spokesman for the Toronto-based Global Renewable Fuels
Alliance, wrote in an e-mailed statement today.  The use of corn to make ethanol in the U.S. affects prices
for the grain across the world, FAO chief Jose Graziano da Silva
told 64 agriculture ministers gathered in Berlin on Jan. 21,
saying cereals should not be used to make biofuels. The
Brazilian took the top job at the FAO on Jan. 1.  “I would urge the new FAO director general to focus on the
real cause of high food prices -- the rising costs of energy,”
Baker wrote in the statement.  The alliance had repeatedly called for an increase in the
use of biofuels to help reduce reliance on crude oil, the group
wrote in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
