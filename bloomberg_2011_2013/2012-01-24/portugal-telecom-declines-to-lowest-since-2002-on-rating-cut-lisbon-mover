Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC) , the
country’s biggest telecommunications company, fell for a second
day in Lisbon trading to the lowest since 2002 after its debt
rating was cut to junk status by  Standard & Poor’s  last week.  “The S&P downgrade is weighing on PT shares,” said Juan
Dieste, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon. “A weak economy in
Portugal and the fact that the company is still trying to jump-
start its operations in Brazil doesn’t help.”  Portugal Telecom  dropped  as much as 8.6 cents, or 2.1
percent, to 4.06 euros, the lowest since October 2002. The
shares traded 0.9 percent lower at 4.11 euros as of 9:55 a.m.  S&P downgraded  Portugal  Telecom’s credit rating to BB+ from
BBB- on Jan. 20. “Portugal Telecom is exposed to sovereign-
related risks and highly exposed to domestic country risks
despite some diversity benefits from its stake in Brazilian
player Oi,” the credit rating company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
