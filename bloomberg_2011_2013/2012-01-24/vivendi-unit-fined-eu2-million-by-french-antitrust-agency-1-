SRR, a unit of  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR, was
fined 2 million euros ($2.6 million) for anticompetitive pricing
practices for calls to phones outside its network in the French
islands of Reunion and Mayotte.  SRR violated the terms of an 2009 order to charge the same
prices for calls made and texts sent in-network and outside,
only applying it to  text messages ,  France ’s Competition
Authority said today.  The different rates created an “artificial club effect”
that could be “abusive,” according to a  statement  today on the
regulator’s website. The original complaint was filed by
competitor France Telecom SA’s Orange and local provider
Outremer Telecom. The companies are the principle service
providers in Reunion and Mayotte, the regulator said.  A spokesman for SFR didn’t immediately return a call for
comment on the fine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
