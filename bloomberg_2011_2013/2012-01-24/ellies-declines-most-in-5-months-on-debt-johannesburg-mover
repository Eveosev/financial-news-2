Ellies Holdings Ltd. (ELI) , a maker of
satellite television antennas, declined the most in five months
as it increased debt and said net asset value was lower than the
market share price after a 12-month surge.  Ellies dropped as much as 9.4 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Aug. 26, to 2.69 rand. It traded 8.1 percent lower
at 2.73 rand as of 3:05 p.m. in Johannesburg, where the company
is based, paring the advance to  30 percent  in a year.  Net asset value rose to 2.18 rand a share in the first-half
through October, from 1.81 rand a year earlier, Ellies said in a
statement today. Basic earnings per share increased to 21.01
cents from 15.16 cents.  Interest-bearing debt advanced by 116 million rand ($14.5
million) to 236 million rand in the period. Debt jumped to the
equivalent of 28 percent of equity, from 16 percent in October
2010. Working capital was depressed by as much as 211 million
rand since the end of April.  Additional  capital investment  in production plants and
equipment were funded through additional gearing, said Ellies.  “Negotiations are being finalized with the group’s bankers
for the restructuring of short-term funding into term debt,”
Ellies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
