The  International Swaps and
Derivatives Association  will probably rule that  Greece  is in
default if there are creditor holdouts to restructuring talks,
according to  New York University ’s Edward Altman.  That is the most likely outcome, Altman, a finance
professor at the Stern School of Business, said during a
Turnaround Management Association conference in New York today.  European finance ministers meeting in Brussels today
signaled they would push Greece’s private investors to accept
bigger losses after bondholders made what the negotiator for the
creditors described as their “maximum” offer. Euro area
governments are seeking to fill a deeper-than-expected hole in
Greece’s finances by having investors accept a lower  interest
rate  on exchanged bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
