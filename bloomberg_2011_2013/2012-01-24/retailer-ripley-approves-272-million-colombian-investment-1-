Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY) , Chile’s third-
largest department-store operator, approved a plan to open
stores in  Colombia  next year.  Ripley will invest $272 million over four years in the
Andean country and expects to open its first store in the first
half of next year, according to a statement posted on the
website of Chile’s securities regulator.  Colombia will become Ripley’s third Latin American market
after Chile and Peru. Latin America’s economy will grow 3.5
percent this year, exceeding a global expansion of 2.3 percent,
according to the median estimates of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Ripley follows larger Chilean rivals  SACI Falabella (FALAB)  and
Cencosud SA into Colombia. The stock fell 0.8 percent to 502.43
pesos at the close in Santiago after sliding as much as 1.5
percent before the Colombian plan was announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
