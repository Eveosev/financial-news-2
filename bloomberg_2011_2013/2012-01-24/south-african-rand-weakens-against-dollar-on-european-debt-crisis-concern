The rand fell to its lowest against
the dollar in a week as stalemate between European policy makers
and Greek bondholders over how to resolve the nation’s debt
crisis sapped demand for riskier, emerging-market assets.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated as much as 1 percent to
8.0140 per dollar, its weakest level since Jan. 18, and traded
at 8.0112 as of 4:22 p.m. in Johannesburg. Against the euro, it
declined 0.6 percent to 10.3883.  Finance ministers meeting in Brussels yesterday balked at
putting up more public money for  Greece , calling on bondholders
to provide greater debt relief in order to point the way out of
the two-year-old debt crisis. South Africa’s benchmark stock
 index  declined, snapping a six-day rally.  “Direction at the moment is coming exclusively from
developments abroad, most notably the euro zone,”  George Glynos , an economist at Johannesburg-based ETM Analytics, wrote
in e-mailed comments. “News that a Greek deal had been rejected
has soured sentiment to some extent.”  The rand strengthened 2.2 percent last week after the
central bank left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 5.5
percent, maintaining the rand’s yield advantage over the dollar.  South Africa’s 13.5 percent bonds due 2015 gained for a
second day, driving the yield down one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
