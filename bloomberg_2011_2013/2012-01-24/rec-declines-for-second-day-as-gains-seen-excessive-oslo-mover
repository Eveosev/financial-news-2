Renewable Energy Corp. ASA (REC) , the
Norwegian solar-energy components maker, dropped for a second
consecutive day as investors deemed this year’s gains excessive,
according to Terra Markets AS.  REC fell as much as 5 percent in Oslo, the worst performer
of the 25-member OBX Index, which was down 1.2 percent as of
11:51 a.m. local time. REC declined 4.3 percent to 4.29 kroner.  The company’s shares are up about 30 percent this year,
outperforming the 12 percent gain of the 37-member  Bloomberg
Global Leaders Solar Index. (BLGS)  Members include Q-Cells SE,
Solarworld AG, Trina Solar Ltd. and First Solar Inc.  “Look at REC’s peers that were weak lately, while REC rose
substantially,” Tomas Skeivys, a Vilnius-based analyst at Terra
said by e-mail. “This discrepancy is not something very usual
and therefore, REC started to react negatively to this.”  Sandvika-based REC has closed factories and cut its
workforce because of falling prices. REC and its European peers
have also cut production as demand shrinks in the region, where
 Germany , France and  Italy  have lowered subsidies to cap booming
solar installations.  Solar-energy companies are under pressure from Chinese
manufacturers that have boosted capacity even as international
prices slumped. Berlin-based module maker Solon SE and Solar
Millennium AG, with headquarters in Erlangen, filed for
insolvency last month. Germany is the world’s largest solar
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
