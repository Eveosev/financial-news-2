Zambian President  Michael Sata 
dissolved the board of Zambian Telecommunications Corp., the
fixed-line operator the government took back from LAP Green
Network yesterday.  Mupanga Mwanakatwe is appointed as acting chief executive
officer and chairman of Zamtel in the first step to
“regularize” the operations of the company, Sata said in an e-
mailed statement today from Lusaka, the capital.  The government of  Africa ’s biggest copper producer reversed
the 2010 purchase of a 75 percent stake in Zamtel by LAP Green
after a state investigation found the sale was “irregular.”
The Libyan company paid $257 million for the stake.  LAP Green “categorically rejects any allegation of
wrongdoing” during the acquisition, which was made through an
open and transparent bidding process, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today. The government hasn’t given it an
opportunity to meet to discuss the decision, it said.  “We hope this situation can still be amicably resolved,
and we welcome an opportunity to work with the Zambian
government to achieve this,” LAP Green said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
