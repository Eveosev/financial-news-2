(Corrects to say Iran supplies 20 percent of Natref’s
crude.)  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  said talks about the
possible sale of its business in Iran are ongoing.  The country supplies about 20 percent of the crude oil used
at the Natref refinery, in which Sasol has a 64 percent stake,
in South Africa, spokeswoman Jacqui O’Sullivan said in an e-
mailed response to questions from Johannesburg today. Sasol is
diversifying its crude-oil sourcing “to mitigate risks
associated with oil-supply disruptions from the  Middle East ,”
she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
