Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ACUR) , a maker
of technology to deter drug abuse, rose after its short-acting
painkiller marketed by  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  became commercially
available.  Acura gained 8.1 percent to $4.02 at 4 p.m. in New York.
The shares have gained 33 percent in the last 12 months.  The short-acting oxycodone pill Oxecta with tamper-
resistant properties uses Acura’s Aversion Technology,
exclusively licensed to Pfizer in the U.S., Canada and Mexico,
the Palatine, Illinois-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Acura receives royalties from 5 percent to 25 percent
for the drug, which will be sold in bottles of 100 tablets.  “The commercial availability of Oxecta is an important
milestone and we are pleased Pfizer continues to advance the
commercialization plan for Oxecta,” said Bob Jones, chief
executive officer of Acura, in the news release.  Oxteca acts in a manner similar to opioids and narcotics to
help ease people from addiction, the company said in a
statement. The tablet includes technology that makes it
difficult to abuse or misuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
