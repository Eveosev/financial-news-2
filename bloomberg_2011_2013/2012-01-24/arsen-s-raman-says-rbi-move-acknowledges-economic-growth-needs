R. Shankar Raman, chief financial
officer at Larsen & Toubro Ltd.,  India ’s biggest builder of
power networks and airports, comments on local  interest rates .
He spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today cut the amount of deposits
lenders need to set aside as reserves, or the cash reserve ratio,
to 5.5 percent from 6 percent. The decision was predicted by
three of 21 economists polled in a Bloomberg News survey.  The ratio cut “is a good first step. It is a balanced
approach and a mature approach. It’s encouraging and follow-up
action is critical.  “The Reserve Bank has acknowledged the liquidity problem
in the system. The peak illiquidity was 1.4 trillion rupees ($28
billion) to 1.5 trillion rupees. At least that’s what is
reflected in the borrowing numbers. So, the 300 billion-rupee
relief from the ratio cut will help the economy.  “The RBI also acknowledged that slowing growth needs to be
addressed. Earlier, the body language was inflation needs to be
controlled. We were moving to a zone where you can’t be
indifferent to growth. Also, the government needs to bring its
fiscal deficit under control.  “Hopefully, the RBI will continue with some more measures
for monetary easing. They’ll only be able to do it one step at a
time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
