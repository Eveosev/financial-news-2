ZAO Svyaznoi,  Russia ’s second
biggest telecommunications retailer, hired  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RAIFF)  to sell as much as a 30 percent
stake to raise around $300 million,  Kommersant  reported, citing
unnamed market participants.  The telephone retailer is looking to sell a non-controlling
stake of at least a 20 percent to an investor, the Moscow-based
newspaper said. Svyaznoi’s largest shareholder Maxim Nogotkov
confirmed that he gave the two banks a mandate to sell the
stake, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
