Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields on benchmark bonds to rise from a five-week low, as a
stalemate between European policy makers and Greek bondholders
over how to resolve the nation’s debt crisis cut into appetite
for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due in May
2014 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.09
percent at 10:52 a.m. in Bogota, according to the stock
exchange. The yield on the peso bonds, known as TES, fell to
6.08 percent yesterday, its lowest level on a closing basis
since Dec. 16. The bond’s price fell 0.023 centavo to 106.552
centavos per peso.  Global stocks fell and the  U.S. dollar  rose as European
finance ministers pushed bondholders to provide greater debt
relief for  Greece , denting newfound confidence in  Europe ’s
strategy for coping with the two-year-old debt crisis. Cash-
strapped Greece needs the accord to enable it to make a 14.5
billion-euro ($18.9 billion) bond payment on March 20.  “The external noise is leading some investors to sell TES
in order to buy dollars,” said Camilo Contreras, a fixed-income
analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in Bogota.  The Colombian peso declined 0.1 percent to 1,815.2 per U.S.
dollar, from 1,813.80 yesterday. The peso has jumped 6.8 percent
in 2012, the best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
