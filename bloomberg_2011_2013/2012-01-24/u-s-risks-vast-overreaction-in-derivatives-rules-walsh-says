The level of risk popularly assigned
to the derivatives market is greatly exaggerated, said Acting
Comptroller of the Currency  John Walsh .  U.S. regulators risk a “vast overreaction” in their
efforts to overhaul the global derivatives market, Walsh said in
a speech prepared for a conference of the American
Securitization Forum in Las Vegas today.  “Lack of understanding feeds misperception, and
derivatives are not particularly well understood, even by some
top policy makers,” he said.  While the notional value of derivatives contracts was $248
trillion at the end of September, U.S. commercial banks had $504
billion in net credit exposure to such contracts, about 0.2
percent of the notional values, Walsh said.  “I’m not trying to suggest that this isn’t a big market or
that it doesn’t involve sizeable risks, but the risk ascribed to
derivatives is often many orders of magnitude greater than the
reality,” Walsh said in his prepared remarks.  “ Warren Buffett  colorfully labeled derivatives ‘financial
instruments of mass destruction,’ and, for some, they are not
just a sophisticated component of a bank’s product portfolio,
but toxic instruments that should be pushed out of the banking
system entirely,” Walsh said, referring to the billionaire
chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “That is a vast
overreaction, and it worries me that misperception could
motivate redesign of the system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
