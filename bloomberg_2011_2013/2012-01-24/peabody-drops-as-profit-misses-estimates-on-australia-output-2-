Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the biggest
U.S. coal producer, fell after posting fourth-quarter profit
that missed analysts’ estimates because of lower output at its
Australian operations .  Peabody dropped 1.7 percent to $36.86 in New York after
earlier sliding as much as 7.5 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Nov. 17. Net income rose 5.9 percent to $222.4
million, or 82 cents, from $210 million, or 77 cents, a year
earlier, the St. Louis-based company said today in a statement.
Earnings excluding a tax-related expense were 98 cents, lagging
behind the $1.30 average of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales from Australian mines fell to 6.2 million tons from
6.7 million tons. “Geological issues” reduced output at North
Goonyella in  Australia , Peabody said. The company is also moving
a longwall, a type of coal face at an underground mine, at the
Twentymile pit in  Colorado , which will interrupt production
there.  “This is a weak start to the coal earnings season,” Lucas Pipes, an analyst at Brean Murray Carrett & Co. in New York,
said in a note. “The quarter’s North Goonyella
recovery/longwall move was a greater-than-expected impact.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization at Peabody’s Australian assets were $338.1 million,
compared with the $379.9 million estimated by Pipes.  Peabody forecast first-quarter earnings that also missed
analysts’ estimates. Ebitda will be $500 million to $600
million, it said, compared with the $710 million average of four
analysts’ estimates.  U.S. coal consumption will continue to be affected by
“muted economic growth and additional coal-to-gas switching,”
Peabody said. Electricity generation from coal dropped by an
estimated 5 percent in 2011, the company said.  Fourth-quarter sales climbed 26 percent to $2.25 billion
from $1.79 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
