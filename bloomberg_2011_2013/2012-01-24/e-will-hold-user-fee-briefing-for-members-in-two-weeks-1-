The London Metal Exchange, the
world’s biggest marketplace for industrial metals, will hold a
meeting in two weeks to brief members on a plan to raise trading
fees.  The meeting will take place at 8 a.m. London time on Feb. 7
at the America Square Conference Centre, according to a copy of
the invitation seen by Bloomberg. The LME, where investors buy
and sell metals from aluminum to zinc, advised members last
month that fees would climb 67 percent as of March 1.  Three of the exchange’s directors wrote to members to
oppose the plan, a person familiar with the letter said Jan. 11.
A majority of the board backed the decision and there are no
plans for any changes,  Martin Abbott , the LME’s chief executive
officer, said the next day. The exchange wants to increase fees
to help boost revenue.  “We have received representations from a number of member
companies, and we think it would be useful to hold a briefing
session in order that the rationale for the new fee can be
explained in more detail than was possible in the official LME
fees notice,” Abbott and exchange Chairman Brian Bender said in
the invitation. The briefing will contain proprietary
information, it showed.  James Land, managing director of Amalgamated Metal Trading
Ltd., wrote to members to oppose the plan, the person said. He
was joined by Gavin Prentice, managing director of Marex
Spectron Group Ltd., and Michael Overlander, chief executive
officer of Sucden Financial Ltd., according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
