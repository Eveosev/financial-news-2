Dubai stocks rose to a month high
after last week’s drop pushed shares to the cheapest levels in
almost a year and as oil traded above $100 a barrel.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest
construction company, jumped 2.8 percent.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) 
rose the most since December. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  increased
1.7 percent to 1,364.03, the highest since Dec. 19, at the 2
p.m. close in the emirate. Dubai’s shares slumped to the lowest
since May 2004 on Jan. 16, with companies in the gauge
retreating to the  cheapest level  since March.  The rally is “a rebound from a seven-year low that was
somewhat unjustified, given the low volumes associated with the
drop,” said Hassan El Salah, head of institutional equities at
Al Ramz Securities LLC, an Abu Dhabi-based brokerage. “These
stocks have been battered the past few weeks.”  The 31 stocks in Dubai’s  benchmark stock index  are valued
at an average 0.62 times net assets, or book value. That
compares with 1.65 times for  emerging market stocks  and 1.52
times for the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index . About 144 million shares
were traded  in the emirate today , compared with a 12-month daily
average of about 100 million shares.  Crude oil for March delivery rose as much as 0.6 percent to
$100.18 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  before
trading at $99.34 at 4:32 p.m. in Dubai. Gulf Arab oil
exporters, including the United Arab Emirates and  Saudi Arabia ,
supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Penny Stocks  “The record lows prompted speculators to run after penny
stocks, and that has driven up market liquidity,” said Tariq Qaqish, deputy head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal
Capital. “That encouraged investors who were sitting on the
sidelines waiting for a good time to enter.”  Arabtec advanced 2.8 percent to 1.84 dirhams, the highest
since October 2010. Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest
tower, gained 3.7 percent, the most since Dec. 4, to 2.55
dirhams.  Abu Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  rose 0.4 percent. Kuwait’s
 Stock Exchange Price Index (KWSEIDX)  added 0.6 percent, while Bahrain’s  BB
All Share Index (BHSEASI)  climbed 0.3 percent. The  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX) 
advanced 0.1 percent and the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index  declined
0.1 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  retreated 0.3 percent and Oman’s
 MSM 30 Index  decreased 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
