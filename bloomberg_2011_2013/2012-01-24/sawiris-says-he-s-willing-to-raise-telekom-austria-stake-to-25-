Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris 
said he’s happy to raise his stake in  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  to as
much as 25 percent.  The billionaire has partnered with investor Ronny Pecik on
Telekom Austria and they jointly hold just over 20 percent in
the company. The Austrian government holds 28.4 percent.  Sawiris, speaking at a conference in Munich yesterday, said
he will work with the government, because he “believes” in
Telekom Austria, which owns mobile networks in seven eastern
European countries.  He said that markets outside Austria were especially
attractive. “We will get value out of the company,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
