The Earth will be bombarded today by
the strongest solar radiation storm in six years, with a limited
potential to affect satellites and power grids, officials say.  The  coronal mass ejection , a violent release of plasma and
magnetic fields from the sun, is hurtling toward the Earth at 4
million miles per hour and should  hit  about 9 a.m. New York
time, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration.  “The last time we had a radiation storm this strong was
May 2005,” said Doug Biesecker, a physicist at NOAA’s Space
Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado. “That’s really
the reason this event is remarkable -- it’s just been so long
since we’ve seen this.”  The ejection will bring with it a geomagnetic storm that
could reach a G3  level , or “Strong” ranking. While the
radiation may be felt by communication system satellites and the
 power grid  on Earth, scientists expect little practical effect,
Biesecker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
