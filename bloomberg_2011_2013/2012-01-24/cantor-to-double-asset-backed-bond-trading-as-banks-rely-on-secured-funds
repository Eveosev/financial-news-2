Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the New
York-based investment bank, plans to double its asset-backed
securities and covered-bond trading and sales unit in  Europe  as
banks become more reliant on the secured debt for funding.  The firm is hiring one trader and about four salesmen to
its existing team of five, according to Shammi Malik, the head
of asset-backed securities and covered bond trading and sales in
 London . Cantor is planning to expand coverage for regions
including  Germany , France, the U.K., Spain and Portugal.  Chief Executive Officer  Howard Lutnick  said Jan. 11 that
Cantor and its BGC Partners brokerage unit plan to hire more
than 500 people this year. Securities firms cut more than
200,000 jobs last year as trading slumped and deals were pulled
amid declining economic growth and the sovereign-debt crisis,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Banks are deleveraging and reducing balance sheets”
while “smaller, similar brokers will fall by the wayside due to
tougher market conditions,” said Malik, who has been in
securitization for more than 20 years in positions including
head of asset-backed securities trading at Societe Generale SA.  Cantor also plans to get mandates to manage sales of asset-
backed securities in primary markets, he said.  Asset-backed securities pool home and consumer loans that
can be sold to investors as notes. Covered bonds are backed by
mortgages or public-sector loans and guaranteed by the issuer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
