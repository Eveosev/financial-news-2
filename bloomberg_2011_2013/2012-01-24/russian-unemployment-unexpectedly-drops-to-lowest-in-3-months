Russian  unemployment  unexpectedly
fell last month to its lowest level since September, signaling
there may be room for consumer demand to improve.  The jobless rate dropped to 6.1 percent from 6.3 percent in
November, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in
an e-mailed statement. The median forecast of nine economists in
a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
