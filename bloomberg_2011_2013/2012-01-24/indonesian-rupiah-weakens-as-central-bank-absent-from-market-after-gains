Indonesia ’s rupiah fell, snapping a
four-day gain, on speculation the central bank has refrained
from intervening to support the currency after it rose by the
most in two years last week. Bonds dropped.  Bank Indonesia has not been in the market today, according
to Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.
The central bank said last week that it will buy government
bonds to support the currency. The rupiah gained 1.5 percent
last week on optimism a credit rating upgrade by Moody’s
Investors Service will boost demand for Indonesian assets.
Markets in  China , Taiwan, Singapore,  Hong Kong , Malaysia and
South Korea were closed today for the Lunar New Year holidays.  “ Bank Indonesia  is always monitoring the market and it
will come in when it thinks it’s the right time,” Bolung said.
“It will be a quiet day today because of the holidays.”  The rupiah dropped 0.5 percent to 8,990 per dollar from Jan.
20 as of 4:19 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local
banks compiled by Bloomberg. Local financial markets were closed
yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose for the first time in seven trading days. The rate climbed
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.62 percent,
according to the prices by Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
