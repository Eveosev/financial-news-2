An  Army Corps  of Engineers
contracting official, Michael A. Alexander, will plead guilty to
bribery and conspiracy charges brought in connection with an
alleged $20 million false billing scheme, prosecutors said.  The U.S. attorney’s office in  Washington , in a federal
court filing today, said Alexander will admit to taking bribes
and conspiring to launder money. The maximum sentence for
bribery is 15 years in prison and the maximum sentence for money
laundering conspiracy is 20 years.  Alexander, of Woodbridge, Virginia, was accused along with
a colleague, Kerry Khan, of funneling more than $45 million
through a contract he was in charge of to a company that kicked
back $20 million generated by overbilling. Also charged were
Khan’s son and Harold Babb, the director of contracts for Eyak
Technology LLC  in Dulles,  Virginia .  Prosecutors call the case one of the “most brazen” frauds
in federal contracting history.  Bill Miller, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen,
declined to comment “because this remains a pending matter.”  Alexander’s lawyer, Christopher Davis, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment on the plea.  The case is U.S. v. Khan, 1:11-cr-00276, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
