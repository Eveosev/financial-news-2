BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, will probably approve a $5 billion
expansion of its Escondida venture in Chile this quarter,
according to Deutsche Bank AG.  The enlargement will include a third concentrator, and
increase production to 1.3 million metric tons of copper a year,
Deutsche Bank analysts Grant Sporre, Rob Clifford and Tim Clark
wrote in a report today.  The project may raise the bank’s valuation of Escondida to
$18 billion, based on forecasts including a long-term copper
price of $2.77 a pound, they said. Copper for March delivery
held at $3.7995 a pound at 12:19 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .  Escondida is the world’s largest copper mine, according to
 BHP , which owns a 57.5 percent stake. A new concentrator is
“currently the subject of a feasibility study,”  Ruban Yogarajah , a BHP spokesman in London, said today by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
