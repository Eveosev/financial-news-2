APA Insurance Ltd. ,  Kenya ’s second-
biggest general insurer, plans to expand in neighboring  Uganda 
and Tanzania and boost market share in its home country.  The company, which controls 8.7 percent of the Kenyan
market, will open three outlets in Uganda this year and plans to
acquire a “controlling stake” in Reliance Insurance of
Tanzania, Chief Executive Officer Simon Clayton told reporters
in Nairobi today. APA already owns 34 percent of Reliance, it
said in a statement handed to reporters today.  “We foresee numerous opportunities to widen our reach and
deepen penetration of insurance in the country by opening a
branch in each county,” Clayton said in the statement.  Kenya,  East Africa ’s biggest economy, enacted a new
constitution in August 2010. The new charter created 47 counties
in the nation of about 40 million people. APA intends to expand
its market share in the nation to 15 percent by 2016, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
