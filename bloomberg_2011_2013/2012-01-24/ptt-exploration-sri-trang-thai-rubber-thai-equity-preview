Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand   trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Bangkok.  The  SET Index (SET)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,063.08, the
highest level since Sept. 8.  Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD)  , Thailand’s largest
construction company, gained 1.2 percent to 3.46 baht, the most
since Jan. 12. The company and its partner secured a contract
worth 2.85 billion baht ($91 million) from the State Railway of
Thailand, it said in a regulatory filing.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , the nation’s biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, fell 1 percent to 20.8 baht,
halting a four-day gain. Rubber may drop “sharply” through
March as the end of the low-production season in Southeast Asia
approaches and demand stays weak in China, the biggest consumer,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
