Serbia received the last 100
million-euro ($130 million) installment of a 250 million-euro
loan from the  European Investment Bank  to finance exports by
small- and medium-size businesses.  The funds will be distributed as seven-year loans by banks,
chosen by the Luxembourg-based lender, to companies employing as
many as 3,000 people, Narodna Banka Srbije said in a statement
on its  website  today.  The EIB approved the 250 million-euro  credit line  last year
and disbursed the first part of 150 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
