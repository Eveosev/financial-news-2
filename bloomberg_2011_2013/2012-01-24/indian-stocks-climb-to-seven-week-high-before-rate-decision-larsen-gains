India ’s benchmark stock index rose
to become the world’s best performer this year after the central
bank cut lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios for the first time
since 2009 and signaled future rate cuts.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. , the largest engineering company,
soared the most in 11 months.  State Bank of India , the biggest
lender, paced advances among its peers.  Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. (STLT)  and  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , two of the nation’s
biggest metal makers, climbed at least 3 percent.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, jumped 1.5
percent to 16,995.77 at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, its highest close
since Nov. 14. The measure has risen 17 percent this year in
dollar terms, the most among 91 indexes tracked by Bloomberg.
The BSE Bankex Index gained 3.2 percent, set for its best month
since May 2009. The BSE Capital Goods Index, which slumped by
half in 2011, climbed to two-month high. The  BSE Realty Index (BSEREAL) 
rose to its highest level since Nov. 14.  “The rally may sustain because the massive gap between
last year’s outperformers, like consumer goods and healthcare
stocks, and underperformers, like capital goods, metals and real
estate companies, has to be bridged,” Sadanand Shetty, senior
 fund manager  at Taurus Asset Management Co., which has about
$921 million in assets, said by phone from Mumbai. The cut in
the reserve ratio may be followed by a reduction in  interest
rates  in the next policy review, he said.  The Sensex plunged 25 percent last year on concern a weak
rupee and seven interest-rate increases will worsen the effects
of  Europe ’s crisis on earnings. It trades at 15 times estimated
profit, down from 19.4 times at end of 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Markets Index is valued at 10.1 times.  Prediction  The  Reserve Bank  of India reduced the  cash reserve ratio  to
5.5 percent from 6 percent, seeking to add about 320 billion
rupees ($6 billion) into banks. The decision was predicted by
three of 21 economists in a Bloomberg News survey, with two
foreseeing a quarter-point cut and the rest no change.  Brazil ,  China  and Russia have cut funding costs or reduced
lenders’ reserve requirements amid Europe’s debt crisis. While
India’s inflation, stoked by a falling rupee, is the fastest in
the BRIC group, it eased to a two-year low last month, giving
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao scope to inject cash into an economy
that grew the least since 2009 in the third quarter. The RBI
today lowered its growth forecast to 7 percent for the year to
March from the 7.6 percent predicted in October.  “The economy would have stalled” if the central bank had
not cut the reserve ratio, said Shishir Bajpai, senior vice
president at Mumbai-based IIFL Wealth Management Ltd., which has
$1.8 billion in stocks under management and advisory. “We will
focus on distressed assets in the banking, infrastructure,
capital goods and power sectors. There’s no point looking at
defensives if you’re expecting the tide to turn.”  Engineering, Banking  Industrials, or companies most tied to the economy, and
lenders led today’s rally, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Larsen jumped 5.8 percent to 1,351.85 rupees, heading for
its best month since May 2009 with a 36 percent rally.  State
Bank  rose 5.2 percent to 2,040.8 rupees, its 11th day of gains.
 ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the second-biggest lender, added 3.7 percent to
888.05 rupees. Sterlite, the largest copper and zinc maker,
jumped 3.1 percent to 111.2 rupees. Aluminum maker Hindalco rose
4.7 percent to 143.5 rupees. Sterlite and Hindalco were the
biggest losers on the Sensex in 2011.  “This is basically a risk-rally, which means the stocks
that were hammered in 2011 have made a big bounce-back,” said
Taurus Asset’s Shetty.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India Ltd. gained 1.6 percent to 5,127.35. The  BSE 200 Index 
added 1.7 percent to 2,062.34 and the BSE Mid-Cap Index climbed
1.3 percent to 5,758.14, set for the highest close since Dec. 7.  Foreign  funds  sold a net $ 2.55 million  of Indian stocks
yesterday, ending 14 straight days of purchases. They have still
bought $1.4 billion of local equities this year, data from the
 regulator  show. They sold $512 million of equities in 2011,
compared with a record inflow of $29.4 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
