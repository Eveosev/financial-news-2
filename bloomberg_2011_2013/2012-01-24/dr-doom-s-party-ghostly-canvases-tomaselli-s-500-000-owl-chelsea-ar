Japanese model Mie Iwatsuki has
inspired painter Alex Katz, photographer  Robert Frank  and
 Nouriel Roubini , aka “Dr. Doom.”  On the artistic side, the results can be seen at Freight +
Volume gallery in Chelsea,  Manhattan . “Mie: A Portrait by 35
Artists” includes paintings, sculpture, drawings and video.  Roubini supplied the after-party venue with his East
Village triplex following the opening on Jan. 21.  “It’s a bunch of great, cool young artists,” he said,
surveying the crowd. “Contemporary art is one of my great
passions.”  A photograph by Chinese artist Lin Yilin shows Iwatsuki’s
reflection in Roubini’s roof pool as she presses his 2010 book,
“Crisis Economics,” to her chest. In Frank’s two Polaroid
photos, the model’s face is seductively aglow. In Katz’s
painting, it’s flat and blank.  “I have an identity crisis,” said Iwatsuki, towering
above most guests in a sleeveless, rhinestone-studded black
gown. “Everyone has a different view of me.” She and art
dealer Nick Lawrence curated the show.  Prices range from $2,000 to $350,000. The show runs through
Feb. 25 at 530 W. 24th St.; +1-212-691-7700;

doesn’t use neatly stretched canvas. He paints on various
textiles: linen, burlap, hemp, cotton and silk surfaces that are
stained, stitched or wrinkled. Threads hang loosely and seams
are visible.  In one work, a lone yellow silk form sewn onto the upper
part of an otherwise empty 8-by-6-foot burlap canvas glows like
an icon.  Some canvases are painted from the back, which allows oil
to seep through the fiber and add a ghostly quality. One such
work is a striking field of pink. In another, black oil paint
crystalized into tiny beads on loosely woven burlap.  Prices range from $20,000 to $85,000. The show runs
through Feb. 25 at 532 W. 20th St.; +1-212-367-9663;

sold for $500,000 within the first hour of Art Basel  Miami
Beach ’s VIP preview, at the booth of  James Cohan Gallery .  On Jan. 21, the work, depicting an owl with orange CD-size
eyes, reappeared in the new exhibition at money manager Glenn
Fuhrman’s Flag Art Foundation.  Titled “In Living Color,” the show features large-scale
chromatic experiments by blue-chip and hot artists. A
commissioned painting by Dan Colen was done with pigments made
of crushed flower petals. Cy Twombly’s turquoise canvas pulsates
with yellow scribbles and vermillion drips and brushstrokes.
Mark Grotjahn’s 2011 abstract composition is so densely layered
its viscous oil paint extends about an inch beyond the canvas.  The works are not for sale. The show runs through May 19 at
545 West 25th St.; 9th Floor, +1-212-206-0220;
