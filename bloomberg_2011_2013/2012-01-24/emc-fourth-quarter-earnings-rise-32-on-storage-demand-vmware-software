EMC Corp. (EMC)  gained the most in almost
three years after reporting a 32 percent increase in fourth-
quarter earnings as data growth spurs demand for its products
and software from majority-owned  VMware Inc. (VMW)   The world’s biggest maker of storage computers rose 7.3
percent to $25.14 at the close in New York, the biggest gain
since March 2009. The stock fell 5.9 percent in 2011. VMware
rose 7.7 percent to $92.66.  EMC is benefiting as a rising tide of digital data fuels
purchases of storage gear, while a boom in data-center building
generates demand for VMware software designed to make servers
more efficient. The company has used acquisitions like Data
Domain, Isilon and Greenplum to focus on growing parts of the
data storage and backup market, Maynard Um, an analyst at UBS AG
who recommends buying the stock, said in a note to investors.  “They continue to gain market share really across all
segments of the storage market,” said Brian S. Freed, an
analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc. in Denver who rates the
shares “buy.”  Net income  rose to $832 million, or 38 cents a  share , from
$628.6 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, the Hopkinton,
Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit was 49 cents, beating the 46-cent average
 estimate  of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sales (EMC)  advanced 14 percent to $5.57 billion topping the
$5.49 billion average  estimate .  ‘Guidance Looks Beatable’  EMC forecast 2012 revenues of $22 billion, in line with
analysts’ estimates. The company anticipates adjusted earnings
of $1.70 a share, 1 cent below the average estimate.  The “2012 guidance looks beatable,” Rob Cihra, an analyst
at Evercore Partners Inc. in  New York , said in a note. “We
continue to see prospects for upside.” Cihra has an
“overweight”  rating  on the stock.  The company excludes stock-based compensation,
amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related charges from
its adjusted earnings.  VMware, the biggest maker of software that lets computers
run multiple operating systems, yesterday reported sales and
profit that topped analysts’ estimates as corporations bought
programs to make servers more efficient. Sales rose 27 percent
to $1.06 billion, compared with the $1.05 billion average
prediction.  To contact the reporters on this story:
