Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (C)  was
sued by Loreley Financing over almost $1 billion in
collateralized debt obligations backed by residential mortgages.  Loreley, a group of nine Jersey-based investment companies
formed to invest in CDOs, claimed in a complaint filed in state
court in Manhattan today that Citigroup lied about the riskiness
of the residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS,
underlying the investments. The CDOs are now worthless, Loreley
said.  Loreley claimed that from September 2006 to July 2007
Citigroup sold it $965 million of notes in 11 CDOs and profited
by charging fees and unloading loans likely to lose money.
Loreley seeks an order rescinding its purchase of the notes and
the return of its $965 billion investment.  “Citigroup devised and implemented several fraudulent
schemes through which it was able to mitigate its exposure to
the impending collapse of the subprime market even as it
continued to earn lucrative fees securitizing subprime RMBS and
arranging and marketing CDOs stocked with these increasingly
toxic assets to unsuspecting investors such as plaintiff,”
Loreley claimed.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup, said, “We believe the suit is without merit.”  The case is Loreley Financing (Jersey) No. 3 Ltd. v.
