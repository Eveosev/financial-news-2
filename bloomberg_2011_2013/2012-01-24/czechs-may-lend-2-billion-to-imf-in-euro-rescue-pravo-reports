The  Czech Republic  may lend 1.5
billion euros ($1.95 billion) to the  International Monetary Fund 
as part of a mechanism aimed at tackling the euro areaâ€™s debt
crisis,  Pravo  reported without saying where it got the
information.  The Czech Republic should contribute to efforts to solve
the debt crisis because it receives funds from the European
Union, the newspaper reported in its online edition, citing
Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek. The Czechs were initially
asked to provide a 3.5 billion-euro loan, Pravo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
