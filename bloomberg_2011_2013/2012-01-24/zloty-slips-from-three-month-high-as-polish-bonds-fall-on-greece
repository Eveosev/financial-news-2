The zloty slid from its strongest in
more than three months versus the euro and Polish bonds snapped
a six-day rally as talks halted on how to resolve  Greece â€™s debt
crisis, droving investors from riskier assets.  The Polish currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 4.3006 per
euro by 1:33 p.m. in Warsaw after yesterday reaching its
strongest intraday level since Oct. 17 of 4.2760. Bonds
declined, lifting five-year  yields  by seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 5.14 percent, according to generic
bond indexes compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
