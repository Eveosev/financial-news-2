U.S. Senator  Mark Kirk  of  Illinois 
is doing well a day after surgery to relieve pressure on his
brain after a stroke, his neurosurgeon told reporters in
 Chicago .  “He asked for his BlackBerry yesterday, so he’s ready to
go back to work,” Dr. Richard Fessler said at a news conference
today at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.  “He has slight facial paralysis on the left side,” the
surgeon said. “Mentally he’s doing very well.”  Kirk, 52, is moving his left side very little, Fessler
said.  The Republican lawmaker checked himself into the hospital
on Jan. 21. Neurosurgeons removed an 8-by-4-inch section of his
skull yesterday to relieve pressure. “It is deep-frozen
sterilely so we can use it to put it back on” after the
swelling subsides, Fessler said.  Kirk may remain in intensive care for a week, the doctor
said. Yesterday, Fessler told reporters that it will be “very
difficult” for the senator to use his left arm again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
