A suicide bomber detonated a minibus
full of explosives outside a compound in southwestern  Somalia 
that houses Ethiopian troops, said an official from a pro-
government militia.  “An Ethiopian soldier fired on the minibus before it
entered the compound and the attacker exploded himself at the
front gate,” Sheikh Ahmed Abdullahi of the Ahlu Sunna Wal Jama’a
militia said in a mobile-phone interview today from Beledweyne,
near the Ethiopian border. “No casualties were reported.”  Ethiopian soldiers entered Somalia last month to help
government forces capture Beledweyne from al-Shabaab, the al-
Qaeda-linked militant group that controls most of southern and
central Somalia.  The attack on Beledweyne was carried out by al-Shabaab,
said an unidentified spokesman for the group who spoke on Radio
Andulus, a broadcaster controlled by the militia.  Ethiopia’s intervention in Somalia is its second since
2006. Its forces withdrew in January 2009 after pushing the
Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu, and later becoming bogged
down in a guerrilla war with Islamic militants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
