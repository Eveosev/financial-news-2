Oil dropped as a stalemate between
European policy makers and Greek bondholders over debt relief
increased concern that the European credit crisis will spread.  Futures fell 0.6 percent after euro-area finance ministers
balked at putting up more public money for  Greece , calling on
holders of its debt to provide more aid. The  International
Monetary Fund  cut its global economic forecast as  Europe  slips
into recession and growth cools in China and  India .  “The Greek debt impasse is weighing on the market,” said
 John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based
hedge fund that focuses on energy. “The IMF warning this
morning dampened any economic optimism.”  Crude oil for March delivery fell 63 cents to settle at
$98.95 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 13 percent from a year earlier.  Futures were little changed from the settlement after the
 American Petroleum Institute  reported that crude oil inventories
rose 7.33 million barrels to 337.4 million last week. March
crude decreased 52 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $99.06 a barrel in
electronic trading at 4:32 p.m.  Brent oil for March settlement dropped 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $110.03 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1 percent and
the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.3 percent. The  S&P 500 
retreated from the highest level since July because of the Greek
stalemate. Yesterday, the index extended a rebound from its 2011
low to almost 20 percent.  ‘Demand Fears’  “The European debt crisis has crept back up into the
forefront with the Greek concerns,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago. “The lowering of
the IMF growth forecast is playing into demand fears.”  The world economy will expand 3.3 percent this year and 3.9
percent in 2013, compared with September forecasts of 4 percent
and 4.5 percent, the IMF said. The euro area may enter a “mild
recession” this year and contract 0.5 percent compared with a
previous estimate of a 1.1 percent expansion. The U.S. outlook
was held at 1.8 percent growth.  China ’s estimated expansion was cut to 8.2 percent from 9
percent. India is expected to grow 7 percent in 2012, 0.5
percentage point less than in September forecasts.  European Economy  European services and factory output climbed in January. A
euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in both industries rose to 50.4, a five-month high,
from 48.3 in December, London-based Markit Economics said in a
report today.  The composite PMI was forecast to rise to 48.5, according
to the median of 17 economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “The strong PMI data from Europe is putting a floor under
the market,” said Chris Dillman, an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  The 27 member states of the European Union accounted for 16
percent of global consumption in 2010, according to BP Plc’s
annual Statistical Review of World Energy.  Crude prices climbed earlier as Iran criticized a European
embargo on its crude exports without repeating threats to
disrupt shipping in the  Persian Gulf .  European Union foreign ministers agreed to ban oil imports
from Iran starting July 1 as part of measures to ratchet up the
pressure on the Persian Gulf nation’s nuclear program, the 27-
nation bloc said in a  statement  yesterday.  Iranian Threat  Iranian Vice President Mohammad Reza Rahimi threatened on
Dec. 27 to block the Strait of Hormuz, the transit route for
about a fifth of the world’s oil, if the EU banned the country’s
oil exports.  “There’s been a lot of talk from Iran but no concrete
action,” Flynn said. “There’s been a sigh of relief since the
sanctions were announced and there’s no sign that the Strait of
Hormuz will be blocked.”  U.S. oil inventories probably rose by 1.45 million barrels
last week, according to the  median estimate  of 12 analysts
polled before a weekly Energy Department report tomorrow.
Gasoline  supplies  rose 2 million barrels, the survey showed.
Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes diesel
and heating oil, declined 125,000 barrels.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 440,518
contracts as of 4:30 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 423,323
yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 30 and 30 percent below
the three-month average. Open interest was 1.34 million
contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
