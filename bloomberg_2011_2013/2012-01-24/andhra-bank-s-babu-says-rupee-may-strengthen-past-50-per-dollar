Vikas Babu, a currency trader at
state-run  Andhra Bank  in Mumbai, comments on the outlook for
 India ’s rupee in a telephone interview.  The rupee advanced 0.5 percent to 50.0825 per dollar in
Mumbai yesterday, taking this month’s gain to 6 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three-month dollar-
rupee forward premium fell 31 basis points, or 0.31 percentage
point, to 8.30 percent in the biggest drop in a month.  “The rupee will open around 50.04 or 50.02 as Asian
equities are higher today. It will then take out 50 before
weakening again on oil importers’ demand for dollars.  ‘‘I am positioning for a range from 49.92 to 50.30. The
market is bullish on the rupee and in a sell-dollar mode.
Traders are expecting a cut in the cash-reserve ratio at the
central bank’s policy review today, which is why we have seen
forward premiums fall. If that doesn’t happen, we could see some
sell-off in the rupee.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
