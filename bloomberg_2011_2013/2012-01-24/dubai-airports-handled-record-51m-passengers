Dubai Airports, home to the biggest
Arab airline Emirates, handled a record 51 million passengers
last year as the Persian Gulf business hub benefited from
tourism amid unrest in some parts of the  Middle East .  Dubai Airports plans to invest $7.8 billion to boost its
capacity from 60 million passengers a year to 90 million
passengers by 2018, the state-run facility said in an e-mailed
statement today. The airport expects to complete Concourse 3, a
dedicated facility for Airbus A380s, by the end of this year.  The passenger traffic posted a year-on-year increase of 8
percent. In December, 4.69 million travelers passed through the
airport compared with 4.26 million a year earlier.  “In a year that was characterized by economic uncertainty,
political instability and high oil prices, passenger growth
continued unabated driven by new routes and additional
frequencies,” said Dubai Airports Chief Executive Officer Paul Griffiths. “That trend will continue in 2012 with our two
largest airlines - Emirates and flydubai - set to receive
additional aircraft throughout the year.”  Cargo volumes last year fell 1.5 percent to 2.19 million
tons, driven by economic uncertainty in  Europe  and the U.S. that
eroded  consumer confidence  and led to a drop in exports, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
