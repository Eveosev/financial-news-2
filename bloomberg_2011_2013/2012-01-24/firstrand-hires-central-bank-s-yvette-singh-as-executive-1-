FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , South Africa’s
second-largest banking group, said it appointed Yvette Singh, a
former central bank official, as its public policy and
regulatory affairs executive.  Singh will help FirstRand implement new policies and
planned regulations, the Johannesburg-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement today. Singh, as the deputy registrar of banks
at the central bank until October, was involved in the
regulation and supervision of South African lenders. She worked
at the  Reserve Bank  for 16 years, FirstRand said.  Registrar of Banks Errol Kruger resigned last year and was
replaced by Rene van Wyk in October, the same month that Singh
left the central bank. FirstRand is expanding in Africa and
wants to access Singh’s knowledge both in  South Africa  and
across the rest of the continent, the lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
