Morgan Stanley Smith Barney is
selling U.K. wealth manager Quilter Holdings Ltd. to London-
based buyout firm Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. for an undisclosed
sum.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2012, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “This sale reflects our determination to intensify our
wealth management focus on our core businesses, including the
ultra-high-net-worth market segment in Europe,  Middle East , and
Africa, as we finalize the integration of Morgan Stanley Smith
Barney in 2012,” said Gregory J. Fleming, president of  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  Smith Barney in the statement.  Quilter has about 7.6 billion pounds ($11.8 billion) of
funds under management and oversees money on behalf of
charities, trusts, private clients and pension funds, according
to its website. Quilter is owned by Morgan Stanley Smith Barney,
the brokerage joint venture between New York-based Morgan
Stanley and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, took control of the venture in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
