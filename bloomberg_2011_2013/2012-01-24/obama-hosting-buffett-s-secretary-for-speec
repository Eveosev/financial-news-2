President  Barack Obama  invited
Warren Buffett’s secretary to listen to his State of the Union
address from the First Lady’s box, according to the White House.  Debbie Bosanek will have a balcony seat as the president
explains his support for what he calls the “Buffett Rule,”
proposed by Warren Buffett, to make sure the wealthiest
taxpayers don’t pay a lower effective rate than middle-income
earners.  Dan Pfeiffer , the White House communications director,
made the announcement on Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
