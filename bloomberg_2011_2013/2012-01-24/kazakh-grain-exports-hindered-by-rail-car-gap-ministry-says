Kazakhstan  faces a shortage of the
rail cars it needs to deliver grain exports and has to borrow
vehicles from abroad, according to the country’s  Agriculture
Ministry .  While 10,500 rail cars are needed for grain exports,
Kazakhstan has 5,200, of which only 4,500 are in “working
condition,” according to a statement from the ministry
distributed to reporters today in the capital, Astana.  “Because of this situation, 2,880 rail cars have been
borrowed abroad for grain shipments,” according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
