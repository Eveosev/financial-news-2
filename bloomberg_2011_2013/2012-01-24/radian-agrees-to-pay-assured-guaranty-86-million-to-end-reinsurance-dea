Radian Group Inc. (RDN) , the second-
biggest U.S. mortgage insurer, agreed to pay  Assured Guaranty
Ltd. (AGO)  to end a $12.9 billion bond-reinsurance agreement as it
focuses on the home-loan protection business.  Assured will also buy Radian’s financial-guarantee unit
Municipal and Infrastructure Assurance, or MIAC, for $91
million, Bermuda-based Assured said today in a statement
distributed by  Business Wire . Radian will pay Assured $86
million tied to the termination of the reinsurance deal.  Radian seeks to increase its share of the mortgage-
insurance market after rival PMI Group Inc. filed for
bankruptcy. Chief Executive Officer S.A. Ibrahim said Jan. 13
that “our top priority” is selling home-loan protection, which
compensates lenders for losses when borrowers default and
foreclosure fails to recoup costs. Radian bought MIAC in June
for $82 million.  “With this one transaction, we made great strides toward
improving our capital position and further preserving our
holding company liquidity,” Ibrahim said in a separate
statement.  Robert Tucker, an Assured spokesman, didn’t immediately
respond to phone and e-mail messages after regular business
hours.  To contact the reporters on this story:
