The  International Energy Agency 
expects nominal crude prices to reach $247 a barrel by 2035,
almost twice the $133 assumed by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, even as expectations for demand converge.  The IEA, which represents 28 oil-consuming nations, bases
its assumptions on increasing marginal costs as more supply is
needed to balance higher demand, according to a report received
by e-mail today. OPEC, supplier of 40 percent of the world’s
oil, said in the joint statement it expects prices to be much
lower, based on “the behavior of marginal costs, the impact of
dollar exchange-rate movements on recent prices and potential
future developments, and signals from futures prices.”  “Uncertainty affecting the global economy in the short
term associated with price volatility witnessed over the past
years has fogged structural development making energy
forecasting more difficult than ever,” the IEA said.  Both agencies expect demand for crude at about 74 million
barrels a day by 2035, according to the report, prepared by the
Riyadh-based International Energy Forum before a meeting of the
IEA and OPEC this week in the Saudi capital. The IEF is a group
of nations accounting for more than 90 percent of global oil and
natural-gas supply and demand, established as a forum for
producing and consuming countries to discuss international
 energy security .  OPEC and the IEA converge in their medium-term price
assumptions. The IEA expects nominal  Brent crude  to fall from
$109 a barrel in 2011 to $91 a barrel in 2016, while OPEC
predicts oil will remain at $85 to $95 a barrel to 2020.  Crude for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was at $99.12 a barrel, down 46 cents, at 4:35 p.m.
 London  time. Brent oil for March settlement was down 38 cents at
$110.20 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
