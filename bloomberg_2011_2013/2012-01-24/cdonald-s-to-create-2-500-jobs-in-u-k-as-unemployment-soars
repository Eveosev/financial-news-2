McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s
biggest restaurant chain, plans to create at least 2,500 jobs in
the U.K. this year, helping ease a growing unemployment burden.  The company, which is among the sponsors of this year’s
 Olympic Games  in London, will increase employee numbers in the
country to 90,000,  Oak Brook , Illinois-based McDonald’s said
today in an e-mailed statement. More than half the new jobs will
go to people under the age of 25, it estimates.  McDonald’s announcement comes a day after Wal-Mart Stores
Inc.’s Asda supermarket chain said it will invest more than 500
million pounds ($778 million) this year to open 25 new stores
and three new depots, adding 5,000 jobs. U.K. unemployment rose
to the highest rate in 16 years in the quarter through November,
the Office for National Statistics said last week.  U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron  said McDonald’s has a
“great record in investing in the U.K. and providing
excellent training, apprenticeships and opportunities.”  McDonald’s, which operates more than 1,200 restaurants in
Britain and Ireland, said the jobs being created will be spread
across the U.K., with the majority in England.  Spending restrictions by Cameron’s government to offset a
record budget deficit may lead to about 700,000 job cuts through
early 2017, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.
Lloyds Banking Group Plc said last week it will cut 700 U.K.
jobs, while women’s clothing chain Bonmarche said yesterday it
will close 160 stores after being bought by an affiliate of Sun
European Partners LLP from administrators to Peacock Group Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
