EDF SA (EDF) ’s North American renewable-
energy unit ordered 25 wind turbines from Repower Systems SE to
replace older equipment at a wind farm in Solano County,
California.  The 2.05-megawatt turbines will be installed at the
company’s Shiloh IV project and, including a previous order from
Repower, will increase its capacity fourfold to 102.5 megawatts,
EDF’s Enxco unit said today in a statement. Fewer turbines will
remain following the upgrade as older units
installed in 1989 are removed, according to the company.  Enxco will build and own Shiloh IV, and utility  PG&E Corp. (PCG) 
has a 25-year contract to purchase its output. Turbine delivery
is scheduled by the end of 2012 and electricity production is
expected to begin before 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
