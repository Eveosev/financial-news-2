  California (STOCA1)  Governor  Jerry Brown ’s
campaign to raise income and sales taxes to avoid deep cuts to
schools collected $1.45 million from  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) ,
American Indian gaming interests, hospitals and a building-
trades union, reports show.  Occidental, the fourth-largest U.S. oil company, donated
$250,000 to support the voter initiative, according to  reports 
filed with the secretary of state as of Jan. 21. Backers need to
collect 807,615 signatures for Brown’s measure to qualify for
the November ballot.  Brown want voters to temporarily raise California’s
highest-in-the-nation sales tax to 7.75 percent and boost income
taxes on individuals earning more than $250,000. The 73-year-old
Democrat estimates the increases would raise $6.9 billion the
first year to balance the budget.  “We’re concerned about the state’s continuing budget
deficit, in general, and the potential adverse effects of these
cumulative deficits on the education system,” Melissa Schoeb, a
spokeswoman for Los Angeles-based Occidental, said in an e-
mailed response to questions. “A strong education system is
critical to our ability to attract and retain top-flight
talent.”  The initiative received $500,000 from the  California 
Association of Hospitals and Health Systems’ political arm. Jan
Emerson-Shea, a spokeswoman for the association, said healthcare
providers have been hurt by cutbacks to Medi-Cal, the state’s
version of the Medicaid program for the poor.  Union Contribution  A contribution of $250,000 was made by the State Building &
Construction Trades Council of California, according to the
filings. Budget cuts have imperiled public-works projects that
are important to union laborers, said Sandy Harrison, a
spokesman for the council.  Indian gaming interests contributed $303,100 toward the
effort, the reports show. Representatives of the Paskenta Band
of Nomlaki Indians, which operates a  casino  near Corning, and
the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians, which runs the San Pablo Lytton
Casino, didn’t return telephone calls requesting comment on
their donations of $100,000 each.  Brown’s plan calls for a four-year increase in sales taxes
to 7.75 percent from 7.25 percent, and a five-year boost in tax
rates for the wealthy.  Individuals earning $250,000 to $300,000 would pay 10.3
percent, up from 9.3 percent. For those earning $300,000 to
$500,000, the rate would be 10.8 percent. Single filers with
income above $500,000 would pay 11.3 percent.  Those earning $1 million or more would pay 12.3 percent
under a 2004 ballot measure earmarking the extra 1 percent for
mental-health services.  Education Spending Cuts  Brown faces a budget deficit of $9.2 billion. If voters
reject the tax proposal, Brown has said he would cut $4.8
billion from schools, the equivalent of taking three weeks from
the academic year.  Brown’s political adviser, Steve Glazer, said by e-mail
that a “broad cross-section” of businesses and individuals
have expressed support for the tax campaign.  “I’m confident we will have the resources to conduct a
successful campaign,” he said.  No political committee has yet been announced to oppose the
initiative.  Jon Coupal , executive director of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers Association, and Kris Vosburgh, the anti-tax
organization’s executive director, didn’t return telephone calls
or e-mail messages yesterday seeking comment on Brown’s measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
