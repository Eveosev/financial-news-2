MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) , the mortgage
insurer that injected $200 million into a subsidiary last month
to keep writing policies, posted its sixth straight loss as
borrowers struggled to make home-loan payments.  The fourth-quarter net loss narrowed to $135.3 million, or
67 cents a share, from $186.7 million, or 93 cents, a year
earlier, the Milwaukee-based company said today in a statement.  The pace of defaults is “simply not coming down fast
enough,” Matt Howlett, an analyst with Macquarie Group Ltd.,
said in a phone interview before results were announced. He
rates the company “outperform.”  The worst U.S. housing crash in seven decades drained
capital at mortgage insurers and prompted regulators to order
 PMI Group Inc. (PMI)  and Triad Guaranty Inc. to halt sales of new
coverage. MGIC, which pays lenders when homeowners default and
foreclosures fail to recoup costs, said today it will get the
waivers it sought from the Wisconsin regulator and  Fannie Mae 
that will allow the firm to continue to write new policies.  MGIC said its risk-to-capital ratio will probably exceed
the maximum 25-to-1 allowed by some state regulators in the
second half of this year. The ratio was 20.3-to-1 on Dec. 31
compared with 22.2-to-1 on Sept. 30.  Share Slump  The insurer advanced 9 cents to $4.15 at 4 p.m. in New
York. MGIC, which has been  unprofitable  for 17 of the last 18
quarters, plunged 54 percent in the 12 months.  Radian Group
Inc. (RDN) , the Philadelphia-based mortgage insurer, has declined 62
percent.  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus liabilities
used by analysts and investors, slipped to $5.95 from $6.90 as
of Sept. 30. The annual net loss for 2011 widened to $485.9
million from $363.7 million in 2010. MGIC said it expects to
continue to report yearly losses.  MGIC’s cost of claims from mortgage defaults rose to $482.1
million from $448.4 million in the year-earlier period. The
company spent $1.90 on claims and expenses at its mortgage
business for every dollar it collected in premiums in the
quarter. That’s up from $1.69 in the year-earlier period.  Policy sales slipped 2.8 percent to $263.8 million from
$271.4 million a year earlier. The operating loss, which
excludes some investment results, was $1.19 a share, missing by
30 cents the average estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  About 87 insured borrowers caught up on overdue payments in
November for every 100 who defaulted, compared with a so-called
cure ratio of 95 a year earlier, according to the most recent
industrywide  data  from the Mortgage Insurance Companies of
America. Borrowers tend to catch up on loan payments in the
second quarter after receiving tax refunds then slip behind in
the last six months of the year, said Howlett.  To contact the reporters on this story:
