Storing solar- and wind-generated
energy may prove nearly as important as creating it, according
to the chairman and chief executive officer of Idealab, a
technology venture-capital firm.  “If you ever want to have round-the-clock solar, which the
whole world does want to have, you have to have storage,”  Bill Gross , who founded Idealab in 1996, said in a telephone
interview before traveling to Davos,  Switzerland , for the  World
Economic Forum . “Anything that can make it so that we have more
on-demand power, especially with renewables, is going to be a
big factor.”  About one-third of the companies in Pasadena, California-
based Idealab’s  portfolio  are linked to clean power, including
the energy-storage startup Energy Cache, Gross said.  Energy Cache is developing a “gravity-based storage
system, like pumped hydro,” that uses clean energy to move
materials or water uphill to be released later to generate
energy, Aaron Fyke, president of Energy Cache, said in an e-
mail. “There is a tremendous need for low-cost, grid-scale
energy storage,” Fyke said.  A slideshow describing Energy Cache’s proposal was posted
in November on  thegatesnotes.com , along with a comment from
Microsoft Corp. founder  Bill Gates .  “Storage is a critical problem if we’re going to expand
the use of solar and wind power,” Gates wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
