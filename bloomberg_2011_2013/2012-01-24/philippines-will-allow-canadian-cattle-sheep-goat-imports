Canadian livestock producers can now
ship live cattle, sheep and goats to the  Philippines , the
Canadian Agriculture Ministry said.  “ Canada  welcomes this decision by the Philippines,” Ed
Fast, the international trade minister of Canada, said today in
an e-mailed statement. “This is yet another win for Canadian
workers and producers and their families.”  The Philippines imports C$9 million ($8.91 million)
annually of cattle and nearly C$300,000 of sheep and goats,
according to the statement sent by Agriculture and Agri-Food
Canada. The Philippines imported more than C$235 million worth
of Canadian agricultural and agri-food products in 2010,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
