Cairn (CNE)  Energy Plc, which spent about
$1 billion on exploring off Greenland without making a find,
canceled plans to award more than 2.5 million pounds ($3.9
million) in shares to former Chief Executive Officer Bill Gammell.  The company withdrew the resolution from its  circular  to
shareholders distributed on Jan. 10 after receiving comments
“from several institutional shareholders,” Edinburgh-based
Cairn said today in a statement. It will “consult further with
shareholders on the matter” before a meeting set for Jan. 30.  Cairn on June 16 said that Gammell will step down as CEO
and become non-executive chairman. Gammell, a former
international rugby player for Scotland, led the company as it
discovered oil and gas in  India . He was behind the $8.7 billion
sale of the majority of its India business to  Vedanta Resources
Plc (VED) , which was delayed by about 16 months.  Cairn, which doesn’t plan further Greenland drilling this
year and will be focusing on exploring in the  Mediterranean Sea ,
will return $3.5 billion to shareholders from the India deal in
a special dividend.  Cairn fell 2.8 percent to 284.1 pence in London trading at
9:31 a.m. The shares are down 35 percent in the last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
