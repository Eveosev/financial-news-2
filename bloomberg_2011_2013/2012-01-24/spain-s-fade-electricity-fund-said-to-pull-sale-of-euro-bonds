Spain ’s Electricity Deficit
Amortization Fund, established to compensate utilities that lost
money because of a government policy to cap consumer power
prices, pulled a planned bond sale, according to four people
with knowledge of the matter.  The fund known as FADE had planned a benchmark-sized issue,
meaning at least 500 million euros ($649 million), a banker
involved in marketing the transaction said. The deal managers
approached investors with pricing of about 70 basis points, or
0.7 percentage point, more than Spanish government debt for the
notes due June 2016, said the banker, who declined to be
identified.  The deal would have been FADE’s first this year. Citigroup
Inc., Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank
AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  had been hired to
manage the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
