Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) , a U.S. lumber
producer and home builder, fell for a third day on concern there
may not be a quick recovery in U.S. housing construction.  Weyerhaeuser dropped 1.3 percent to $19.96 at the close in
 New York . Shares of the Federal Way, Washington-based company
have lost 5 percent since Jan. 19, when they reached a five-
month high of $21.12 and U.S. data was released showing housing
starts last month were lower than economists estimated.  “I just think Weyerhaeuser at $21 is kind of ridiculous,”
 Paul Quinn , a Vancouver-based analyst at RBC Capital Markets
Quinn, said today in a telephone interview.“Everyone’s been
expecting this quick housing recovery, but I just don’t see it.
The stock is drifting down to where it should be.”  U.S. homebuilders began working on fewer houses than
forecast in December, according to Commerce Department figures
released last week. Starts fell to a 657,000 annual rate last
month, less than the 680,000 starts estimated on average by 76
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Building  permits , indicators for future construction
activity, were little changed, according to Commerce Department
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
