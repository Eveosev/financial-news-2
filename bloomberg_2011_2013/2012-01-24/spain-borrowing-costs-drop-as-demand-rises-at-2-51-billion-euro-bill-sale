Spain  sold 2.51 billion euros of
bills ($3.26 billion), just above its maximum target for the
sale, as a surge in demand helped bring down borrowing costs.  Spain sold three-month bills at a rate of 1.285 percent,
the Bank of Spain said, the lowest since March and down from
1.735 percent when the securities were last sold on Dec. 20, the
day before Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  took over. It sold six-
month bills at 1.847 percent, compared with 2.435 percent.  Demand for the three-month debt was 4.32 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.86 times at the auction last month. That
ratio on the longer-dated bills rose to 6.87 from 4.06. The
Treasury aimed to sell as much as 2.5 billion euros of bills.  Spain sold short-term debt for the second time since the
People’s Party government came to power in December and pledged
to implement budget cuts and an overhaul of the banking system
and labor market. Still, the economy is set to  shrink  1.5
percent this year, the Bank of Spain said yesterday, and Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro has urged the European Union to ease
a deficit target that would force Spain to cut its shortfall by
almost half in one year.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond rose after the
auction to 5.472 percent, from 5.467 percent before the sale.
The  spread  over German bunds of the same maturity was 349 basis
points, compared with 346.9 basis points before the sale and
348.9 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
