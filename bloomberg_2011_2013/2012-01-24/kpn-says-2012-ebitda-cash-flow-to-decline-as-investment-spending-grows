Royal KPN NA (KPN) , the biggest Dutch
telephone company, said earnings and free  cash flow  will fall in
2012 as the company undertakes investments in a “transition
year.”  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, excluding reorganization costs, will amount to 4.7
billion euros ($6.12 billion) to 4.9 billion euros, compared
with 5.3 billion euros posted in 2011, and free cash flow will
total 1.6 billion euros to 1.8 billion euros compared with 2.4
billion euros, the Hague-based company said today in a
statement.  Capital spending may increase to as much as 2.2 billion
euros this year, versus 2 billion euros in 2011, as the company
adds mobile broadband capacity in Germany and Belgium, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
