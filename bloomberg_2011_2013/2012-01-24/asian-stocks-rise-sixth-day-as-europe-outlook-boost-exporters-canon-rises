Asia ’s  benchmark stock index  rose
for a sixth day, edging up even after optimism that European
policymakers were making progress on the debt crisis was damped
by a stalemate with Greek bondholders.  Nintendo Co. (7974) , a Japanese maker of video-game consoles that
gets 34 percent of its sales in Europe, rose 1.5 percent in
 Tokyo  after the euro rose against the yen.  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) 
advanced 4.6 percent on a report the Japanese chipmaker is in
merger talks.  State Bank of India , the nation’s biggest lender,
advanced 5.2 percent in Mumbai after the central bank
unexpectedly cut lenders’ reserve ratios.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  rose 0.1 percent to 121.09 as
of 5:18 p.m. in Tokyo after swinging between gains and losses at
least eight times. The six-day run is the gauge’s longest
winning streak since early December. Seven of the measure’s 10
industry groups advanced.  “After such a big run up in the last month or so, it
wouldn’t surprise me to see markets correct a little bit,”
 Shane Oliver , Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP
Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under
management, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “There’s
still a lot of uncertainty around  Europe  and the Greek
restructuring issue is still to be resolved.”  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose 0.2 percent even
after the  Bank of Japan  cut its national growth outlook.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 was little changed. The BSE  India 
Sensitive Index advanced 1.5 percent to a two-month high.  Stock markets in  China ,  Hong Kong  and South Korea and
 Singapore  were shut for the Lunar New Year holiday.  Greece  Talks  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.5 percent
today. The gauge added 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after
Germany and France said talks between Greece and bondholders
were making progress. The euro rose 0.6 percent to 100.25 yen
yesterday. A strong euro boosts the value of Asian exporters’
earnings overseas.  Nintendo gained 1.5 percent to 10,760 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
Japanese camera maker that generates about a third of its
revenue in Europe, rose 0.6 percent to 3,410 yen.  “The market has gotten used to developments in Europe, and
investors are expecting things won’t get worse after they priced
in negative factors,” said Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at
Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $30 billion. “The euro’s rebound against the yen is
contributing to a buyback in shares. The question is how long it
will last.”  Call for Relief  Gains in stocks were limited as European finance ministers
balked at putting up more public money for Greece, calling on
bondholders to provide greater debt relief to help ease the way
out of the crisis.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , the company on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  that
gets the highest percentage of revenue generated in Europe,
slumped 1.9 percent to 153 yen.  State Bank of India  gained 5.2 percent to 2,040.8 rupees
after the central bank cut the amount of deposits lenders need
to keep in reserve for the first time since 2009 and signaled
future interest-rate cuts.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the nation’s
largest engineering company, gained 5.8 percent to 1,351.9
rupees, the steepest gain in 11 months.  “The rally may sustain because the massive gap between
last year’s outperformers, like consumer goods and health care
stocks, and underperformers, like capital goods, metals and real
estate companies, has to be bridged,” Sadanand Shetty, senior
 fund manager  at Taurus Asset Management Co., which has about
$921 million in assets, said by phone from Mumbai. The cut in
the reserve ratio may be followed by a reduction in  interest
rates  in the next policy review, he said.  Elpida, Mirabela  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (TPX)  gained 6.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.6 percent by the S&P
500 and 5.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 1.3 times book value. That
compares with 2.1 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index in
the U.S. and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  Elpida Memory Inc. advanced 4.6 percent to 367 yen after a
report the chipmaker is in merger talks with Micron Technology
Inc. and  Nanya Technology Corp. (2408) , the Yomiuri newspaper said,
without citing a source. The paper also reported Elpida needs 92
billion yen ($1.2 billion) to repay loans and bonds due as early
as March. The chipmaker dismissed the report.  Mirabela Nickel Ltd. (MBN)  slid 13 percent to A$1.055, the
miner’s biggest drop in almost three years. Analysts cut their
recommendations on the nickel producer after production costs
rose at its mine in Brazil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
