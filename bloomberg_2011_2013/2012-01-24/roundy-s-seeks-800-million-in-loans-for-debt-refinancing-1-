Roundy’s Supermarkets Inc. (3016B) , a
grocery-store chain, is seeking $800 million in loans to
refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing for the
Milwaukee company, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Roundy’s will hold a
lender meeting Jan. 26 to discuss the deal.  The financing will include a $675 million  term loan  B due
in due in seven years and a $125 million revolving line of
credit maturing in five years, said the person.  The proposed term loan will have covenants, the person
said. Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning Roundy’s would have to pay 1 cent more than
face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Willis Stein & Partners LP and Norwest Equity Partners
purchased Roundy’s for an undisclosed amount in June 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In October 2009, the company extended the maturity of a
$649.2 million term loan to November 2013, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Roundy’s also has a $150 million
second-lien term loan due in April 2016, the data show.  David Busch, vice president of administration at Roundy’s,
and Philip Pool, managing director of  investor relations  and
business development at Willis Stein, didn’t respond to e-mail
messages seeking comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, while second-lien debt is repaid next. In a
revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again once it’s
repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
