Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said that his government is committed to its fiscal-
consolidation plan and is sticking to its 4.4 percent budget-
deficit target for 2012.  “The Spanish government’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation is total,” de Guindos told reporters at a press
conference in Brussels today. “The government’s deficit target
is 4.4 percent and there is no change in this respect.”  De Guindos’s comments contrast with the position of Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro, who called on Jan. 22 for the
European Union to ease  Spain ’s 2012 deficit goal to allow for
shrinking economic output. De Guindos, a former Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. banker, said yesterday that Spain had an
“inescapable commitment” to austerity.  De Guindos also said today that Spain has “no solvency
problem.”  Speaking about topics up for discussion at the EU summit on
Jan. 30, he said European ministers will discuss ways to boost
the region’s economy “and the growth potential of countries.”  “There is a clear will to support economic growth,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
