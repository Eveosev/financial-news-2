Kenya ’s shilling appreciated for the
first time in three days as the central bank curbed  money supply 
through  repurchase agreements .  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.7 percent to 85.60 per dollar and traded 0.3 percent
higher at 85.93 at 3:53 p.m. in Nairobi.  Kenya’s central bank sold 250 million shillings ($2.9
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements at 18 percent, after
offering 500 million shillings of the securities, Godfrey
Putunoi, a trader in the Nairobi-based bank’s money market
department, said in a phone interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a second day on increased
dollar demand from oil importers. The currency of the second-
largest East African economy depreciated 1 percent to 1,607.50
per dollar and was trading 0.2 percent lower at 1,594.63 at 3:03
p.m. in the capital  Dar es Salaam .  “The shilling has depreciated on a combination of demand
mainly from the oil sector and interbank trading,” Hamis
Mwakibete, head of trading at Commercial Bank of Africa Tanzania
Ltd., said today by phone from Dar es Salaam.  Uganda’s currency strengthened for a fourth day, the
longest streak in over a month, on increased dollar inflows from
commodity sales and non-governmental organisations.  The currency of the third-largest East African economy
appreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 2,369.60 and was trading
0.2 percent higher at 2,378 at 3:49 p.m. in the capital Kampala.  “There are heavy dollar inflows from commodity exports
especially coffee coupled with end of month conversions by non-
governmental organizations,” Taib Lubega, a currency trader at
Stanbic Bank  Uganda  Ltd. said by phone from Kampala.  The nation’s central bank will offer 100 billion shillings
($42 million) of three-, six- and 12-month bills tomorrow. The
3-month yields at last sale on Jan. 11 were 22.859 percent  “There is anticipation in the market that there will be
dollar inflows from offshore players who want to buy Treasury
bills tomorrow,” Lubega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
