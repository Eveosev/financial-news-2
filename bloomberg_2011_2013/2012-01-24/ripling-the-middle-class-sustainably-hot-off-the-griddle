Good afternoon, and welcome back to the Griddle, a menu of fortified items for the busy person's media diet. The most commonly asked question about the word "sustainability" isn't, "What's the key trend driver here?" but rather "What exactly are you talking about?" The  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  estimates there are 1.8 billion middle-class consumers; by 2030, that number could reach 4.9 billion. That prospect is focusing minds and sharpening pencils in many executive suites. It represents the grandest of opportunities, but also raises the thorny questions: Do we have enough stuff for everyone, and if so, where should they throw it out when they're done with it? Corporate sustainability means working on those questions and divining the risks and rewards they represent. The questions are similar, but the answers are always unique.
