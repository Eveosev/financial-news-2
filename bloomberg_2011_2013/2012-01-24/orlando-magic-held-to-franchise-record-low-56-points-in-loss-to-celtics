The  Orlando Magic  set a franchise
record for fewest points scored in last night’s 87-56 loss to
the Boston Celtics, who logged their first victory over a team
with a winning record this season.  Dwight Howard was the only Orlando player to score in
double figures, totaling 18 points and 14 rebounds in Boston as
the Magic (11-5) had a four-game road winning streak halted.  Orlando’s previous franchise-low point total was 57 in a
Dec. 4, 1996, loss to Cleveland. Since the 24-second shot clock
was introduced in 1954, the fewest points scored by one team in
a National Basketball Association game is 49, by the  Chicago
Bulls  against the Miami Heat on April 10, 1999.  Paul Pierce  and Brandon Bass each scored 19 points for the
Celtics (7-9), who had been 0-6 this season against teams with a
winning record. The 56 points matched the fewest allowed by
Boston during the shot clock era.  To contact the reporter on this story:
