The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its forecast for South African economic growth for 2012 to 2.5
percent as  Europe  slides into recession.  The estimate compares with 3.6 percent predicted in
September, the Washington-based fund said in an update of its
World Economic Outlook released today. The  economy  expanded 3.1
percent in 2011, it said.  “The impact of the global slowdown on sub-Saharan Africa
has to date been limited to a few countries -- most notably,
 South Africa ,” according to the report.  The debt crisis in Europe, which buys about a third of
South Africa’s manufactured goods, is undermining the recovery
in Africa’s biggest economy, threatening a target to create 5
million jobs by 2020. In October, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  cut his estimate for growth this year to 3.4 percent
from 4.1 percent. South Africa’s  jobless rate  of 25 percent is
the highest of 61 nations tracked by Bloomberg.  Sub-Saharan Africa’s economy will probably expand 5.5
percent in 2012, down from an earlier estimate of 5.8 percent,
the IMF said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
