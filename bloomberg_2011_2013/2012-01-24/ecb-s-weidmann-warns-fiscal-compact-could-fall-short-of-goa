European Central Bank Governing
Council member Jens Weidmann said there’s a danger that
negotiations toward  Europe ’s fiscal compact may produce a deal
that falls short of the original goal.  “Preliminary indications that have come out lead to the
fear that the design of the rules will fall short of the goals
and political declarations made,” Weidmann said in remarks
prepared for an event in Eschborn,  Germany  today. “It’s
decisive that there are strict and clear rules that can’t be
sidestepped as they were in the past.”  European leaders are in the final stages of negotiating a
deal that would see countries committed to a target structural
deficit of no more than 0.5 percent of gross domestic product,
as part of an overhaul of fiscal oversight in the region
prompted by the sovereign debt crisis. German finance minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  said today he’s “very confident” the deal
will be completed by the beginning of next month.  “The goal of a structurally balanced budget should be
given greater weighting, in that debt brakes should be anchored
in national law,” Weidmann said. “It is necessary to bring
self-responsibility, accountability and control back to fiscal
policy, and maintain the disciplining function of financial
markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
