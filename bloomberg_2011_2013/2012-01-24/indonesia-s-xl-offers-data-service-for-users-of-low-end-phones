XL Axiata Tbk PT (EXCL)  will offer users of
low-end mobile phones an inexpensive data plan for applications
such as Facebook and Twitter using software from  Blaast Oy , a
Finnish startup.  Customers in  Indonesia  can pay 1,100 rupiahs ($0.12) a day
for unlimited access to applications on the service, Axiata and
Helsinki-based Blaast said today in an e-mailed statement. Local
developers are creating content for the Blaast platform, the
companies said.  Blaast keeps most of the application code and data on the
network, reducing the load on the simple handsets used by most
mobile consumers in  emerging markets . It competes with native-
and browser-based application formats from vendors including
Opera Software ASA and handset makers such as Nokia Oyj.
Investors include Skype venture capital spinoff  Ambient Sound
Investments  and  Steve Blank , an entrepreneurship lecturer at
 Stanford University .  “XL data services have reached more than 24 million users,
or more than 50 percent of total subscribers,” XL President
Director Hasnul Suhaimi said in the statement. Blaast will allow
XL to “differentiate on the competitive market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
