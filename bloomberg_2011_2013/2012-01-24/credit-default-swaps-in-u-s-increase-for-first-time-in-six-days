A benchmark gauge of U.S. company
credit risk rose from a five-month low as talks over Greek debt
restructuring faltered, stoking concern that  Europe ’s fiscal
crisis may spread.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
increased 0.4 basis point to a mid-price of 103.3 basis points
at 5:23 p.m. in  New York , according to Markit Group Ltd.  The gauge climbed for the first time in six days after
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters
talks about relieving Greece’s debt burden were “off track.”
His comments outweighed a Labor Department report that showed
unemployment dropped in 37 U.S. states in December.  “Risk appetite suddenly turned south as Greek debt
negotiations shifted to main stage and with both sides reluctant
to budge,”  Andrew Wilkinson , chief economic strategist at
Miller Tabak & Co. in New York, said in an e-mail.  The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, touched 102.5 basis
points yesterday, the lowest level since August.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
