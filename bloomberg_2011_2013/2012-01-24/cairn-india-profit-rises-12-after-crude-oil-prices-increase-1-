Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , operator of the
nation’s biggest onshore oilfield, posted a 12 percent increase
in third-quarter profit, beating estimates, after crude oil
prices rose.  Net income , including that of units, climbed to 22.6
billion rupees ($452 million), or 11.85 rupees a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 20.1 billion rupees,
or 10.53 rupees, a year earlier, the company said in a stock
exchange filing. Profit beat the 20.8 billion rupee median 
estimate  of 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales were little
changed at 31 billion rupees.  The explorer, which London-based miner  Vedanta Resources
Plc (VED)  acquired in December, started output from a new deposit this
month and is targeting a 40 percent increase in production from
the block in the western state of Rajasthan by March.  Brent
crude , the benchmark for Cairn  India ’s selling prices, climbed
an average 25 percent in the quarter from a year earlier.  “Crude prices will remain bullish in times to come and
that means the company will continue to put up such good shows
in coming quarters,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Investments
& Advisors Ltd., said by telephone.  Cairn India  shares  have gained 12 percent this year, after
dropping 5.6 percent last year. The stock, which rose 2 percent
to 351.70 rupees at close in Mumbai before the earnings
announcement, is at the highest level since May 4. The benchmark
 Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  gained 1.5 percent.  Selling Price  Cairn India, based in Gurgaon near  New Delhi , sells oil at
rates linked to Brent crude  oil prices , unlike state-owned Oil &
Natural Gas Corp., which is required to bear part of the
country’s fuel subsidy. Brent crude in London trading averaged
$109.02 a barrel in the quarter ended Dec. 31.  Crude from the Rajasthan block was priced at a discount of
8.3 percent to Brent during the quarter and the company sold
each barrel for $101.1 compared with $76 a year earlier, Cairn
India said in a statement.  Revenue and profit declined by 6.3 billion rupees because
royalty from the Rajasthan field was made cost recoverable after
the deal with Vedanta, Cairn India said.  Cairn India started producing crude from Bhagyam, the
second field in the Rajasthan block, and plans to gradually
raise output to a peak of 40,000 barrels a day, according to a
Jan. 19 stock exchange filing. The Mangala field, which has been
producing about 125,000 barrels a day since August 2010, can
increase output to 150,000 barrels a day, according to spokesman
Manu Kapoor.  Output Target  Fields in the Rajasthan block may produce a combined
240,000 barrels a day, or about 30 percent of India’s current
crude output, according to the company’s  annual report  for the
year ended March 31. The explorer has the potential to take
Rajasthan output beyond 240,000 barrels a day, Chief Executive
Officer Rahul Dhir told analysts on a conference call.  Cairn’s share of output from three producing assets in
India was 98,969 barrels a day, 1.3 percent lower than a year
earlier, according to the statement.  The Rajasthan block is operated by  Cairn India  with a 70
percent stake, while state-run ONGC owns the remainder. Vedanta
won approval for the acquisition from the Indian government on
June 30 on condition that it pays a share of royalties from the
fields. ONGC has paid all the royalties since output started in
August 2009.  Aishwariya Field  Cairn and ONGC have so far spent $3.3 billion to develop
the Rajasthan block, according to the statement. Development has
started at a third field, Aishwariya, and all key contracts have
been awarded, Cairn said.  Vedanta, a metals and mining company with no previous
experience in oil and gas production, and its unit Sesa Goa Ltd.
completed the acquisition of a 59 percent stake in Cairn India
from shareholders, including  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) , for $8.67 billion
in December, 16 months after the deal was announced in August
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
