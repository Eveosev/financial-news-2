The economy of Angola,  Africa ’s
second largest crude producer, grew 3.4 percent last year with
“prudent” policies, the  International Monetary Fund  said in a
review of a $1.4 billion loan program.  The Washington-based lender is scheduled to meet in late
March to consider releasing the final $130 million tranche of a
loan program that began in 2009 after the global economic slump
depressed oil income, said Mauro Mecagni, head of the IMF team
that visited Luanda, the capital, Jan. 11 to Jan. 20.  Angola’s finances were aided by higher  oil prices  and its
ability to contain the non-oil primary deficit at about 44
percent of non-oil gross domestic product, the IMF said. The
government’s target of an inflation rate of less than 12 percent
was helped by a “broadly stable”  exchange rate , according to
the IMF.  “Macroeconomic prospects for 2012 are broadly favorable,
with new  oil fields  coming on stream expected to boost
production above 1.8 million barrels per day,” Mecagni said in
a  statement .  The government’s budget plans should reduce the non-oil
fiscal deficit and trim inflation below 10 percent, Mecagni
said. Larger foreign reserves will provide a stronger buffer
against oil revenue volatility, he said.  Angola had inflation of 11.4 percent in December, down from
15.1 percent in January 2011, according to its National
Statistics Institute.  Sonangol  “Quasi-fiscal operations” by Sonangol EP, the state oil
company, could “explain a large part” of the $32 billion found
missing from state financial records between 2007 and 2010, the
lender said. The government said Jan. 20 it would halt Sonangol
from acting as a financial agent of the state, except for paying
fuel subsidies and some external credit lines for a limited
time.  Angola ’s 2011 fiscal balance recorded a surplus of 12.5
percent of gross domestic product, up from about 7 percent in
2010, the IMF said. Foreign exchange reserves at the end of 2011
reached the equivalent of 5.3 months of imports and the external
current account recorded a surplus equivalent to 7 percent of
GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
