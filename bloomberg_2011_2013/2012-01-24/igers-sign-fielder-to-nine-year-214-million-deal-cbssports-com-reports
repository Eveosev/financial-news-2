The  Detroit  Tigers signed free-agent
first baseman Prince Fielder to a nine-year contract worth $214
million, CBSSports.com reported today, without citing where it
got the information.  Fielder, 27, hit .299 with 38 home runs and 120 runs batted
in last season for the Milwaukee Brewers, who won the National
League Central division title. He also finished third in voting
for the league’s Most Valuable Player award for the second time.  The Tigers last week lost four-time All-Star Victor Martinez for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament
in his left knee. The Tigers were 95-67 last year behind
American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner  Justin Verlander .
Detroit lost to the  Texas Rangers  in the AL championship series
after eliminating the  New York Yankees  in the first round of the
playoffs.  Tigers spokesman Ron Colangelo said in an e-mail that the
team had no comment.  The signing comes six weeks after the other premier free-
agent first baseman, three-time NL MVP Albert Pujols, signed
with the Los Angeles Angels for about $250 million over 10 years.
The 32-year-old Pujols spent his first 11 seasons with the  St.
Louis Cardinals .  In seven seasons, spent entirely with the Brewers, Fielder
hit .282, with 230 home runs, 656 RBI and 571 runs scored. A
three-time All-Star, Fielder won the 2007 and 2011 Silver
Slugger award, given annually to the best offensive player at
each position.  He will pair with first baseman Miguel Cabrera, who has
eclipsed 30 home runs and 100 RBI in each of four seasons with
the Tigers. Cabrera played seven games last season as a
designated hitter, a position held primarily by Martinez.  Fielder’s father, Cecil Fielder, played for the Tigers from
1990 to 1996, hitting 51 home runs his first year. The younger
Fielder was also in negotiations with the  Washington Nationals ,
according to CBS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
