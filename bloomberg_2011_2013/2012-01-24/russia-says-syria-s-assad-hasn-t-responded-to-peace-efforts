Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
hasn’t responded to efforts to promote a peaceful solution to
10-month-old unrest, said a Kremlin envoy,  Mikhail Margelov .  Russia  is losing confidence in the possibility of a
negotiated outcome in Syria, “because we don’t see any
willingness, either from the authorities or the protesters, to
reach an agreement,” Margelov said today in a phone interview.  Russia in October blocked a bid by the European Union and
U.S. for the United Nations Security Council to condemn the
crackdown in Syria, arguing that Assad was seeking to implement
political changes.  Margelov, a special envoy who traveled to  Libya  last year
in a bid to negotiate Muammar Qaddafi’s departure and has
offered to mediate between the Syrian government and opposition,
said Russia hasn’t received a “clear, positive response” from
Assad.  Syria  yesterday rejected a proposal from the  Arab League  to
form a national unity government within two months to implement
a peaceful transfer of power as a violation to its sovereignty.  More than 5,000 people have been killed in the Syrian
crackdown on opposition unrest since March 2011, according to
the UN. The U.S. has criticized Russia for blocking sanctions
against Syria and supplying weaponry to its Soviet-era ally.
Syria received a shipment of Russian ammunition this month and
has also signed a $550 million deal for 26 Yak-130 jet trainer
aircraft, according to the Kommersant newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
