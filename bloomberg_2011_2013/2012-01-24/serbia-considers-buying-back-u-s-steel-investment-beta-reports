Serbia may buy back the steelworks
it sold to  United States Steel Corp. (X)  more than a decade ago to
prevent closing of the leading exporter,  Beta   news agency 
reported, citing Deputy Premier Verica Kalanovic.  Regaining control of  U.S. Steel Serbia , whose operations
have been hampered by weak demand and competition, would be
possible without additional borrowing by the state, Kalanovic
was quoted as saying, without specifying the potential cost.  The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker said on Oct. 25 that its
operations in Serbia faced “particular challenges,” including
a weaker-than-expected recovery in the Balkan region and
pressure from lower-priced imports, while the economic outlook
meant the company had no plans to restart one furnace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
