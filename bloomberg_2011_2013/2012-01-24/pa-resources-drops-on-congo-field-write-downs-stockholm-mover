PA Resources AB (PAR) , an oil and gas
exploration company focused on  Africa  and the  North Sea , fell
the most in three months in Stockholm after announcing write
downs of as much as 1.85 billion kronor ($274 million) after
taxes.  The share declined as much as 16 percent, the biggest drop
since Oct. 26, which made it the second-biggest decliner on the
OMX Stockholm All Share index. The Stockholm-based company
traded 12 percent, or 0.28 krona, lower at 2.06 kronor as of
3:05 p.m. PA Resources shares lost 72 percent of their value
last year.  The biggest write down, of as much as 1.55 billion kronor,
is a result of a lowered reserve estimates in the Republic of
Congo, mainly the Azurite field, the company said today in a
statement. PA Resources will also make write downs in  Tunisia .
The company said Jan. 9 that the daily average production was
8,400 barrels in the fourth quarter. It was 12,100 on average in
the corresponding period in 2010, a statement from Jan. 7, 2011,
showed.  “As previously reported, oil production at Azurite Field
did not reach expected levels in 2011 and as a result a
corresponding, substantial reduction in reserves now leads to
this impairment,” Chief Executive Officer Bo Askvik said today.  The Tunisian write downs result from the suspension in
October of a well at the Didon North field and PA Resources
agreeing to sell the interests in the Ezzaouia and El Bibane
fields to Candax Energy Inc. for $4 million, which was announced
Jan. 2.  The company had a third-quarter net loss of 114 million
kronor compared with net income of 139 million kronor a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
