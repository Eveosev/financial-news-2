Poland’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  fell less than
0.1 percent to 2,264.78 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw,
snapping a six-day run of gains, the longest rally since May.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)   fell 1.2 percent to 131.1
zloty after the copper miner with the largest European output
was cut to “hold” from “buy” at ING Groep NV. Separately,
Poland’s Treasury Ministry seeks “complete” information on the
purchase of Canada’s Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. by KGHM, the
ministry’s spokeswoman Magdalena Kobos told Bloomberg News by
phone today, confirming a report by TVN CNBC television.  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA  (PGN PW) lost 1
percent to 3.86 zloty, tumbling to the lowest level in two
months. The Treasury Ministry didn’t rule out allowing Poland’s
dominant gas company to buy a stake in  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the
second-largest oil refiner, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna reported,
without saying where it got the information. The government has
majority stakes in both companies. Lotos rose 0.9 percent to
25.42 zloty.  To contact the reporters on this story:
