Alstom SA (ALO)  and Drax Group Plc
enlisted BOC Group Plc, a U.K. gas manufacturer, to help develop
a carbon-capture and storage project in northern England.  BOC Group, based in Guildford, will work on the 426-
megawatt plant to trap and store power-generation emissions
under development at Drax’s site in North Yorkshire, the
companies said today in joint e-mailed statement. BOC, a unit of
Munich-based  Linde AG (LIN) , will contribute its air-separation
technology as well as plant engineering, according to the
statement.  The project’s developers plan to apply for funding from a
U.K. government contest to finance plants demonstrating so-
called carbon-capture and storage technology, according to the
statement. The plant already applied to receive funds under the
NER 300 program devised by the European Commission to assist
renewable technologies and  carbon capture , the companies said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
