EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the largest Internet
marketplace, plans to find a new chief for its PayPal payment
business within three to six months following the departure of
 Scott Thompson , who became CEO of  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  this month.  “There is no immediate pressure to find a successor for
Thompson, as PayPal has a strong team,” Chief Executive Officer
John Donahoe said at a conference in Munich today.  Donahoe is serving as interim president of PayPal, the
fastest-growing part of EBay. PayPal, which is trying to take
customers from credit-card companies such as  Visa Inc. (V)  and
 MasterCard Inc. (MA) , plans to let shoppers pay with its service in
more than 2,000  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  stores by March.  Donahoe said today he hasn’t considered yet whether the new
PayPal chief should come from within the company or should be
recruited externally.  Donahoe, eager to propel a stock price that’s little
changed since he took over in 2008, boosted marketing spending
25 percent last year and upgraded EBay’s technology to lure back
users who defected to rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. EBay is
also getting a lift as PayPal challenges traditional payment
systems by persuading a larger pool of shoppers to use it more
often and for bigger purchases.  EBay last week reported fourth-quarter sales and profit
that topped analysts’ estimates. Revenue at PayPal helped  San
Jose , California-based EBay reach sales of $3.38 billion in the
period.  EBay shares rose 6 cents to $31.99 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading yesterday. The stock gained 5.5 percent this year before
today.  Thompson was lured away from PayPal with a compensation
package valued at as much as $27 million including salary,
bonus, restricted shares and other forms of pay. His base salary
is $1 million with a bonus of as much as twice that, Sunnyvale,
California-based Yahoo said this month.  Thomson replaced former CEO Carol Bartz who was fired in
September after less than three years at the helm. Yahoo founder
Jerry Yang also left the company in the management shakeup.  To contact the reporters on this story:
