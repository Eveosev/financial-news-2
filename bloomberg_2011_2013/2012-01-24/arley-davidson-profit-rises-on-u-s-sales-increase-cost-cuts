Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, had its largest gain since Nov. 30 after
reporting a profit in the fourth-quarter by boosting sales in
the U.S. and lowering costs.  Income from continuing operations totaled $54.6 million, or
24 cents a share, compared with a loss of $42.1 million, or 18
cents, a year earlier, Harley said today in a statement. The
average  estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
profit of 22 cents a share. The shares rose 3.5 percent to
$43.32 at the close in  New York .  Harley, the maker of the Fat Boy and V-Rod motorcycles, has
cut expenses by renegotiating labor contracts at factories in
Pennsylvania and  Wisconsin . The Milwaukee-based company has also
introduced bikes, such as the $7,999 SuperLow, to attract women
and other new riders. Retail sales rose 12 percent in the U.S.
and 11 percent worldwide, the company said.  “This was pretty much what we had intended to do, the new
products we’re bringing to market and how we’re focusing our
market initiatives and trying to reach new customers,” Chief
Executive Officer Keith Wandell said in an interview.  Sales, excluding financial services revenue, increased 12
percent to $1.03 billion. A year ago, revenue totaled $917.1
million. The company raised prices on its bikes last July for
the first time in four years. The increase was 1 percent in the
U.S. and 0.75 percent in  Europe , Chief Financial Officer John Olin said in an interview.  Motorcycle Shipments  Harley-Davidson’s $43.32 closing price is the highest since
July 29 and the shares have gained 11 percent this year after
rising 12 percent in 2011.  Harley shipped 50,730 of its namesake motorcycles in the
quarter, a 14 percent increase from 2010. For the year, it
shipped 233,117 bikes, an 11 percent gain. The company said in
October it expected to ship 228,000 to 235,000 motorcycles in
2011, including as many as 52,500 in the fourth quarter.  Motorcycle sales in  Latin America , Harley’s smallest
region, rose 42 percent during the quarter to 2,492 after the
motorcycle company revamped its dealer network in  Brazil ,
closing nine stores and opening 11.  “The service is better as is the focus on the customer,”
Wandell said. “They’re doing things the way we really expect
things to be done and it’s just having a huge impact.”  This year, Harley-Davidson said it will ship 240,000 to
245,000 motorcycles and 58,000 to 63,000 this quarter.  Fourth-quarter gross margin widened to 31.2 percent from
29.6 percent a year ago. The fourth quarter typically is
Harley’s smallest by sales and profit. For 2012, the company
said gross margin will widen to between 34.75 percent and 35.75
percent, from 33.4 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
