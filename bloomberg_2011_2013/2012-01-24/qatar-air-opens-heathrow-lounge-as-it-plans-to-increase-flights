Qatar Airways Ltd. will open a
business and first-class passenger lounge at  Heathrow airport 
this week, the first such facility outside its home market, as
it prepares for growth at the London hub.  The carrier will increase Doha-Heathrow flights to five a
day from four at present starting March 25, it said in an e-
mailed  statement  today. The new lounge, to feature shower
facilities and offer five-star services, will help the airline
serve premium travellers on one of its busiest routes, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
