Russia  will more than double coal
exports to Asia to an annual 85 million metric tons by 2030,
including 14.9 million tons for China, Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko told Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  in a presentation.  In comparison, Russia shipped 32 million tons to India,
Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and China last year, according to the
presentation today in Kemerovo, Siberia. Exports to Europe will
rise by an annual 5 million tons to 85 million tons by 2030 and
sales in Russia will increase 11 percent to 219 million tons.  Russia will spend 3.7 trillion rubles ($120 billion) on
developing its coal industry through 2030, Putin said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
