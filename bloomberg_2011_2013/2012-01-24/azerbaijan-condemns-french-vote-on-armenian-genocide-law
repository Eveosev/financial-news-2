Azerbaijan  condemned the French
Senate’s approval of legislation making it a crime to deny that
the mass killing of Armenians early last century was genocide.  The move may “undermine France’s participation in some
developments in the region,” the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry
said in an emailed statement today. The ruling Yeni Azerbaijan
party called on France to withdraw from co-chairmanship of the
so-called Minsk Group, which mediates in the Nagorno-Karabakh
conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, because it has lost its
credibility as an honest broker, the APA news agency reported.  French oil company  Total SA (FP)  has a 10 percent stake in the
BP Plc-led Shah Deniz natural-gas development. Total is also
developing the Absheron field, which holds some 350 billion
cubic meters of gas.  Azerbaijan has close ethnic and political ties with
neighboring  Turkey , which vowed to fight the French measure,
risking a further round of Turkish sanctions and deterioration
in relations.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
