Anis Chakravarty, an economist at
Deloitte Haskins & Sells, comments on  interest rates  and
 inflation  in  India . The  Reserve Bank  of India today unexpectedly
cut the amount of deposits lenders need to set aside as
reserves, or the  cash reserve ratio , to 5.5 percent from 6
percent. The decision was predicted by three of 21 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey.  Chakravarty spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “Taking into account the rupee depreciation of the past
few months, we had reached a point where it was absolutely
necessary to ease the liquidity situation. However, the governor
has made it clear that rate cuts are not likely to come soon.  ‘‘Food inflation being in the negative doesn’t necessarily
mean that it’s coming down consistently. That is because the
statistical base is high. On the other hand, there hasn’t been a
sustained drop in the manufacturing index.  ‘‘The numbers don’t give any comfort in showing that
inflation has eased from a policy perspective.  ‘‘We can establish a trend on inflation dropping only if we
see lower numbers till March, making it easier for the central
bank to reduce rates. So I wouldn’t expect cuts before the April
policy decision.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
