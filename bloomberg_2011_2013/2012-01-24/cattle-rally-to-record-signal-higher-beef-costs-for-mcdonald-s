Cattle prices surged to a record for
the sixth time this month on mounting signs that demand for U.S.
beef will exceed output, eroding inventories and signaling
higher costs for restaurants including  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)   Consumer costs for U.S.  beef  increased as much as 10
percent in 2011 and may climb 5 percent this year, the
government has estimated. McDonald’s, the world’s largest fast-
food restaurant, said today that it expects beef prices to keep
rising in 2012. Production may drop 5 percent from a year
earlier by the third quarter of 2012, Allendale Inc. said.  Feedlots in the U.S. bought 5.9 percent fewer cattle in
December than a year earlier, the biggest drop since May, after
a drought reduced available supply in  Texas , the top producing
state, the government said Jan. 20. The drop means fewer animals
will be available for slaughter in coming months, said Paul Beere at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc.  Buying cattle now is “like putting money in the bank,”
Beere, a market adviser, said in a telephone interview from
Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “The justification for being able to pay
these higher prices now is thinking, ‘If we can’t move it, we’ll
put it in cold storage, and it’ll be there in six weeks, and the
kill numbers are going to be way down by then.’”  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.8 percent to close
at $1.29175 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.2945, the highest for a most-active
contract since the commodity began trading on the CME in 1964.
Prices are up 6.4 percent this month, heading for the biggest
January gain since 2002.  Higher costs  Yesterday, wholesale  beef  climbed 0.8 percent to $1.8352 a
pound, the biggest gain in six weeks, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show. Through midday, the meat had gained 6.3
percent in the past 12 months. Last week, spot  prices  averaged
$1.2564 a pound, up 19 percent from a year earlier, USDA data
show.  Retail beef prices climbed to a record $4.572 a pound in
December, up 11 percent from a year earlier, USDA data show.  McDonald’s expects “another midteens increase for beef”
costs this year, Chief Financial Officer Peter J. Bensen, said
in a conference call with analysts today. The  Oak Brook ,
Illinois-based company is the biggest beef user of all U.S.
restaurants, according to CattleFax, an industry researcher in
Centennial,  Colorado .  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement rose 0.7 percent
to close at $1.54875 a pound on the CME. On Jan. 20, the price
reached a record $1.55275.  Feedlots buy year-old animals that weigh 500 pounds (227
kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle are
fattened on corn for about four to five months until they weigh
about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Hog futures for April settlement slid 0.7 percent to close
at 87.85 cents a pound in Chicago. Prices have gained 1.9
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
