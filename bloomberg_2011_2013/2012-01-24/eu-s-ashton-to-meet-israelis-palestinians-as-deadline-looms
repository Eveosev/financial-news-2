European Union foreign-policy chief
 Catherine Ashton  headed to the  Middle East  in an effort to
persuade Israelis and Palestinians to renew peace talks before a
deadline this week set by international mediators.  Ashton was scheduled to arrive today at Ben Gurion
International Airport near Tel Aviv and hold meetings over three
days with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, her Brussels-
based office said in an e-mailed statement. She also plans to
visit a United Nations facility in the  Gaza Strip .  “I will continue to make every effort to push the peace
talks and encourage the parties in the path toward a negotiated
solution,” Ashton said in the statement.  She is part of the so-called Quartet mediation group that
asked Palestinian and Israeli leaders to come up with proposals
for security arrangements and final borders before Jan. 26 that
would pave the way for formal negotiations, which have been
frozen since September 2010.  The Quartet is made up of representatives from the EU, the
UN, the U.S. and  Russia . Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have been holding informal meetings in Amman, Jordan, in an
effort to resolve barriers to resuming negotiations. Palestinian
officials have said they would like to extend the deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
