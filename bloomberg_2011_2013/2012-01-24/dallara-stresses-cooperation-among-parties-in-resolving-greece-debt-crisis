Charles Dallara , managing director
of the International Institute of Finance, said it’s important
to resolve the situation in  Greece  cooperatively.  “It’s important to all parties to recognize how much we
have at stake here and that we work together cooperatively,” he
said at a press conference in Zurich. Dallara is negotiating a
voluntary debt swap with Greece on behalf of bondholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
