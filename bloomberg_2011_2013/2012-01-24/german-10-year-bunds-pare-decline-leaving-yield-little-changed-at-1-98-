German 10-year bunds pared a
decline, leaving the yield on the securities little changed at
1.98 percent as of 8:47 a.m. London time.  The yield earlier advanced as much as two basis points to
1.99 percent after gauges of manufacturing and services output
in  Europe â€™s largest economy both rose more than forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
