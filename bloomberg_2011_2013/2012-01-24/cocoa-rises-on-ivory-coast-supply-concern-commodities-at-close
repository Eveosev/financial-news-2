The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  was little changed to close at 658.84
at 4:37 p.m. in  New York . Cocoa and base metals climbed.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices gained 0.4
percent to 1,587.615.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa futures surged to an eight-week high on speculation
that supplies will ebb from  Ivory Coast , the world’s top
producer. Raw sugar declined, halting the longest rally in 14
months, while coffee rose.  Ivory Coast farmers have said cocoa output may be hindered
by a stronger-than-usual seasonal harmattan wind that curbs rain
and brings dry, dusty air south from the  Sahara Desert .  On ICE Futures in New York, cocoa for March delivery jumped
6.4 percent to settle at $2,413 a metric ton. Earlier, the price
reached $2,425, the highest level since Nov. 28.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
close at 24.89 cents a pound, halting a six-session rally, the
longest since November 2010.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery rose 0.5 percent
to $2.2045 a pound in New York, the first gain in three days.  In  London , cocoa gained and robusta coffee slid.  BASE METALS  Copper rose for the fifth time in six sessions on
speculation that shipments to  China , the biggest consumer of the
metal, will underpin demand.  Refined-copper imports have advanced for seven straight
months, China’s General Administration of Customs said Jan. 21.
Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose to a
nine-month high last week.  On the Comex, copper for March delivery increased 0.2
percent to settle at $3.8075 a pound. Prices are up 11 percent
in January.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped 0.1 percent to $8,355 a metric ton ($3.79 a
pound).  Aluminum, tin, zinc, nickel and lead rose in London.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures rose, capping the longest rally in almost
four weeks, on signs that demand will gain for U.S. exports as
supplies ease in  Russia  and Ukraine.  The amount of wheat available for export from Russia’s
Southern Federal District has dropped after exports surged this
year, the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies said today.
Winter-grain crops in Ukraine are threatened by freezing
temperatures in the next 10 days.  Wheat futures for March delivery gained 2.2 percent to
settle at $6.335 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price climbed for the fourth straight session, the longest rally
since late December.  Corn futures for March delivery increased 1.7 percent to
settle at $6.3025 a bushel, posting the first four-day gain
since Dec. 28. Soybean futures for March delivery advanced 0.2
percent to $12.20 a bushel on the CBOT, erasing an earlier
decline of 1.1 percent.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures gained for a third day in New York
after Chesapeake Energy Corp., the second-largest U.S. producer,
announced spending and production cuts, signaling the supply
glut may ease.  Gas, the worst-performing commodity in 2012, rose 1.1
percent. Chesapeake said yesterday it would “immediately
curtail” output of 500 million cubic feet a day. Traders
covered some bets that prices would fall as mild winter weather
contributed to the biggest gas surplus in more than two years.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , natural gas for
February delivery gained 2.9 cents to $2.554 per million British
thermal units after gaining as much as 5 percent to $2.65. Gas,
which is down 44 percent from a year ago, fell to $2.231 on Jan.
23, the lowest price since February 2002.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped as a stalemate between European policy makers
and Greek bondholders over debt relief increased concern that
the European credit crisis will spread.  Futures fell 0.6 percent after euro-area finance ministers
balked at putting up more public money for  Greece , calling on
holders of its debt to provide more aid. The  International
Monetary Fund  cut its global economic forecast as  Europe  slips
into recession and growth cools in China and  India .  On the Nymex, crude oil for March delivery declined 63
cents to settle at $98.95 a barrel. Prices are up 13 percent
from a year earlier.  Brent oil for March settlement dropped 55 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $110.03 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold prices dropped the most in a week as the dollar
rebounded from a two-week low, reducing demand for the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  On the Comex, gold futures for February delivery declined
0.8 percent to settle at $1,664.50 an ounce, the biggest decline
for a most-active contract since Jan. 13. Yesterday, the metal
reached $1,681.80, the highest since Dec. 12.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$31.975 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery fell 0.6
percent to $1,552.40 an ounce. Palladium futures for March
delivery dropped 1.2 percent to $680.55 an ounce.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose, reversing an earlier loss, after Hess Corp.
said it’s conducting a technical assessment of the fluid
catalytic cracker at its gasoline-making  Port Reading  refinery
in  New Jersey .  Futures gained 1 percent as Hess said the unit at the
plant, which makes gasoline for the New York area, is
malfunctioning. Hess will continue to operate Port Reading “as
long as it generates acceptable financial returns,” Jay Wilson,
vice president of  investor relations  in New York, said in an
interview.  On the Nymex, gasoline for February delivery rose 2.71
cents to settle at $2.805 a gallon, after falling as low as
$2.7613.  February-delivery heating oil increased 1.44 cents, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $3.0242 a gallon on the exchange.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle prices surged to a record for the sixth time this
month on mounting signs that demand for U.S. beef will exceed
output, eroding inventories and signaling higher costs for
restaurants including McDonald’s Corp.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
April delivery rose 0.8 percent to close at $1.29175 a pound
after reaching $1.2945, the highest for a most-active contract
since the commodity began trading on the CME in 1964. Prices are
up 6.4 percent this month, heading for the biggest January gain
since 2002.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement increased 0.7
percent to close at $1.54875 a pound. On Jan. 20, the price
reached a record $1.55275.  Hog futures for April settlement slid 0.7 percent to close
at 87.85 cents a pound. Prices have gained 1.9 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
