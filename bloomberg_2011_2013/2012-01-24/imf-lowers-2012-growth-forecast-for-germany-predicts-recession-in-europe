The  International Monetary Fund  cut
its forecast for growth this year in  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest
economy, by one percentage point as it predicted a recession in
the region.  German gross domestic product will rise by 0.3 percent in
2012, the IMF said in its world economic outlook published
today. That contrasts with the 1.3 percent growth it forecast on
Sept. 20, and with the 0.6 percent forecast by the Bundesbank in
December. The IMF said the German economy will expand by 1.5
percent in 2013.  “We see no need to revise our forecasts at this time,”
Bundesbank spokesman Magnus Makela said by telephone, commenting
on the IMF report.  The euro area may enter a “mild recession” this year and
contract 0.5 percent compared with a previous estimate of 1.1
percent expansion, the IMF said. The Washington-based fund also
cut its forecasts for global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
