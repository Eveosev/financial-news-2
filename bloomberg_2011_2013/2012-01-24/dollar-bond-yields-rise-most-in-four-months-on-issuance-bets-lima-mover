Peruvian dollar bonds fell, pushing
up yields the most in four months, as investors speculated the
Andean country may sell bonds overseas for the first time in
more than a year.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 4.97 percent at 4:45 p.m. in  Lima , the
biggest increase since Sept. 22. The bond’s price fell 1.53
cents to 122.6 cents per dollar.  Investors are betting  Peru ’s government will issue 10-year,
dollar-denominated bonds after  Mexico  and Colombia tapped
overseas markets this month, said Diego Alvarez, a trader at
Banco Internacional del Peru in Lima. Peruvian Finance Minister
Miguel Castilla said Jan. 11 that the government is in talks
with investment banks about a local or international bond sale.  “Colombia and Mexico have made similar moves, so it looks
like that only leaves Peru,” Alvarez said. “Peruvian debt is
an asset that’s in short supply” and a new issue would be
snapped up by investors, he said.  Colombia  sold $1.5 billion of bonds due 2041 on Jan. 10 to
yield 4.96 percent in its first overseas offering since July.
Mexico issued $2 billion of 10-year bonds to yield 3.706 percent
while  Brazil  sold $750 million more of its 4.875 percent notes
due 2021 to yield 3.449 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Peru last sold debt overseas in November 2010, when it
issued a record $2.5 billion in a mix of sol- and dollar-
denominated bonds.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point to 5.73
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6920 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
