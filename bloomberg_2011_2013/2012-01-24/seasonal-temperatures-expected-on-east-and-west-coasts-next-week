U.S. temperatures from the  Rocky
Mountains  to the  Mississippi River  will probably be above normal
through start of February while seasonal weather takes hold on
both the East and West coasts.  Temperatures may be about 6 degrees Fahrenheit (3.3
Celsius) above normal from the Rockies as far east as Illinois
from Jan. 30 to Feb. 3, according to a 6- to 10-day outlook by
 David Salmon  at Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  Traders watch long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand for heating and cooling. About 51 percent
of U.S. households use natural gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department.  Forecasters vary slightly in how far temperatures may rise
above normal in the Northeast from Feb. 3 to Feb. 7.  MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland  predicted
temperatures in the region, including  New York  and the Canadian
Maritimes, may be about 4 degrees above normal.  Commodity Weather Group LLC President Matt Rogers, based in
Bethesda, Maryland, said in his 11- to 15-day outlook that
temperatures in most of the Northeast will be more seasonal and
slightly milder in the Maritime Provinces. Salmon doesn’t issue
a similar forecast.  For Jan. 27, the normal average temperature in New York is
33 Fahrenheit (0.6 Celsius), according to MDA. In Boston it’s
29; in Chicago, 24; Atlanta, 44; Houston, 54; Seattle, 43; and
Burbank, California, 55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
