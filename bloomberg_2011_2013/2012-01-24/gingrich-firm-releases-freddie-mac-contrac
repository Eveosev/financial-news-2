As presidential hopeful  Newt Gingrich  faced new criticism from rivals for his advisory role
at  Freddie Mac , a consulting firm he founded released today a
copy of a consulting agreement he signed in 2006 with the
mortgage company.  The 16-page document doesn't specify what Gingrich    
did in his role as a consultant, and it only covers one year of
his multi-year services.     Gingrich earned at least $1.6 million working with Freddie
Mac during an eight-year period beginning in 1999. The contract
released tonight covered 2006, a year in which he was to be paid
$300,000.                  The contract was solely for consulting purposes and not
lobbying,’’ a center statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
