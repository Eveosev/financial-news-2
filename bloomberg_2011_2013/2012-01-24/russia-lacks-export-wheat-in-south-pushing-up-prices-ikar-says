Russian supplies of milling wheat
available for export from the Southern Federal District
declined, pushing up prices, the Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies said.  “We see a stormy price increase because grain resources
are becoming limited in the south,” Oleg Sukhanov, the
institute’s grain analyst, said today by phone from Moscow.
“This forced exporters to search for grain in other regions,
including central  Russia , Volga, Ural areas and Siberia.”  Free-on-board prices at the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk
rose 6 percent to $260 a metric ton over the first 20 days of
January, the institute, known as Ikar, said.  Higher transportation costs for grains brought to port from
more distant areas are driving up prices for fourth-grade
milling wheat, Russia’s main export grain, Sukhanov said. That’s
contributing to an increase in global wheat prices, he added.
Wheat futures rose 2.1 percent to $6.1725 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade in the past week.  Russia exported more than 19 million tons of grain,
including 15 million tons of wheat, from the start of the
marketing year on July 1 to Jan. 20, according to the institute.  In 2011, Russia harvested 93.9 million tons of grains after
drying and cleaning, according to Agriculture Ministry data.
This year, the crop may be at least 90 million tons, according
to Sukhanov.  To contact the reporter on this story:
