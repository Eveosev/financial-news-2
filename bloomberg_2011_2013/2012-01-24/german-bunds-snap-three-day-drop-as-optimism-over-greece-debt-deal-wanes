German 10-year bunds snapped a
three-day decline as European finance ministers and Greek
bondholders reached a stalemate over a debt-swap deal,
threatening to prolong the region’s crisis.  Benchmark German yields dropped from a one-month high as
Luxembourg’s Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told reporters
today the Greek plan was “off track” and called on creditors
to drop demands that new bonds carry coupons averaging 4
percent. The Netherlands plans to sell debt due in 2013 and 2042
today, while  Spain  is set to auction bills. Economists say a
euro-area report today will show a contraction in services and
manufacturing output slowed in January.  The German 10-year yield was little changed at 1.96 percent
at 7:46 a.m. London time after rising to 2 percent yesterday,
the highest since Dec. 21. The 2 percent bund due in January
2022 traded at 100.385.  A euro-area composite index based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the services and manufacturing industries rose to
48.5 from 48.3 in December, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Bunds have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French  government
bonds  have slipped 0.1 percent and Greek debt lost 0.2 percent,
the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
