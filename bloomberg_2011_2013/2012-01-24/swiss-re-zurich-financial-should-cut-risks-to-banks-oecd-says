Switzerland should introduce laws to
limit the risks of insurers  Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN)  and  Zurich Financial
Services AG (ZURN)  to the country’s biggest banks, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said  The  Swiss National Bank  and the financial market regulator
should make sure the country is prepared for a simultaneous
trigger of contingent convertible bonds, or Cocos, issued by  UBS
AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the Paris-based organization said
in an economic  survey  of Switzerland published today. Such an
event could become “dangerous” should the buyers of these
bonds be concentrated within a few Swiss financial institutions,
according to the report.  Cocos, which automatically become equity when capital falls
below preset levels, can be used to help banks meet stricter
rules and can contribute close to half of the new  capital
requirements . The holders of these bonds should be able to
absorb any losses after they are converted, and these
instruments should therefore be widely held, the OECD said.  “The two largest Swiss insurance groups’ balance sheets”
together total “more than 100 percent of GDP,” according to
the report. “Significant exposures to” UBS and Credit Suisse
“could exacerbate any financial risks” in the banks because
insurers have some systemic weight, the OECD said.  Switzerland should also introduce orderly resolution plans
for the largest insurers to avoid using taxpayers’ money in the
case of a threat of insolvency, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
