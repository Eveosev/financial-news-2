The  Washington Wizards  fired coach
Flip Saunders after starting the season 2-15 and replaced him
for the remainder of the year with Randy Wittman.  “We felt the team had become unresponsive and we will look
to Randy to provide a different voice and a change in philosophy
moving forward,” Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said in a
statement.  Saunders compiled a record of 51-130 since taking over the
National Basketball Association team in April 2009.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
