Pan Orient Energy Corp. (POE) , a Canadian
oil and natural-gas developer, surged for a second day after the
company said an exploration well in Thailand began producing
oil.  The shares gained 22 Canadian cents, or 6.4 percent, to
C$3.65 in Toronto trading after surging 27 percent yesterday.  The company, based in Calgary, said its test well in
Thailand produced 1,015 barrels a day, the highest flow rate
that Pan Orient has recorded for a conventional sandstone
reservoir in Thailand. The oil developer plans to apply for a
production license and a permit for 12 additional wells, it
said.  Pan Orient is an onshore oil and gas exploration and
production company with operations in Thailand,  Indonesia  and in
 Canada , including Albertaâ€™s oil sands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
