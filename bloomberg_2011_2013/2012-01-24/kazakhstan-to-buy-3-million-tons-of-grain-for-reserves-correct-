(Corrects spelling of CEO’s name in second graph.)  Kazakhstan’s state grain trader will
buy 3 million metric tons of grain for stockpiles, on top of 5
million tons targeted because of a large crop.  About 100,000 tons of the extra allotment was bought at
16,500 tenge ($111) a ton and the price for the rest will be
20,000 to 21,000 tenge a ton, Beybitkhan Kabdrakhmanov, chief
executive officer of JSC National Co. Food Contract Corp., told
reporters in the capital Astana today. The price for the first 5
million tons was 25,000 tenge, he said.  Kazakhstan’s grain crop was 26.9 million tons last year,
according to the State Statistics Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
