Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, appointed 210 managing directors, the fewest
to achieve the company’s highest rank since 2008.  Morgan Stanley listed the appointments today in a Business
Wire statement. The number of employees at the New York-based
firm declined to 61,899 at Dec. 31, down from 62,542 a year
earlier.  Morgan Stanley’s profit fell 13 percent last year to $4.11
billion as the firm had a 4 percent return on equity, below
Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman ’s goal of “mid-teens.”
The company, whose shares dropped 44 percent in 2011, posted the
only trading revenue increase among major U.S. lenders,
excluding accounting gains.  Morgan Stanley had per-share losses in two of the past
three quarters as it took charges to eliminate swap contracts
purchased from  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  and to convert Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc.’s preferred stake to common shares.  The number of new managing directors fell from 232 last
year and 212 the previous year. The firm named 133 managing
directors at the end of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
