Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based
explorer with the most licenses in Africa, expects to begin
output of crude from Uganda by next year, said Chief Executive
Officer Aidan Heavey.  “First oil will probably be 2013,” he said in an
interview in Accra, Ghana’s capital, yesterday. “It will start
off quite small with supplies to local power stations, that’s
about 2,000 barrels of oil a day.”  The start of output at the Lake Albert fields will make
Uganda, which is Africa’s biggest exporter of coffee, its newest
crude producer. East Africa’s third-biggest economy is worth $17
billion, according to the  World Bank .  Tullow, which also operates off West Africa in Ghana’s
Jubilee field, has been seeking approval from Uganda’s
government of its plan to sell one-third of its stake in the
fields to  Total SA (FP)  and  Cnooc Ltd. (883)   The agreement is expected to be signed “very shortly,”
Heavey said. Energy Minister Irene Muloni said Jan. 12 approval
of the $2.9 billion sale would come “to an end soon” after
unspecified issues were resolved.  Production will rise to 200,000 barrels a day “with
pipelines in place,” Heavey said, declining to give further
details.  Tullow’s shares gained 0.4 percent to 1,387 pence yesterday
in London trading, paring its loss this year to 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
