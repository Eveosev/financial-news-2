Spanish tax authorities are
examining whether  Google Inc. (GOOG)  provided accurate information in
its tax filings,  El Pais  reported, citing an annual report by
the Internet search company’s local division.  The routine checks by  Spain ’s tax agency began on Jan. 21
and are related to taxes including value-added taxes from 2006
to 2008 and in 2010, the newspaper reported. The checks do not
imply any wrongdoing, El Pais said.  “We have an obligation to our shareholders to set up a tax
efficient structure, and our present structure is compliant with
the tax rules in all the countries where we operate,” Google
said in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News in response to
the newspaper report.  A spokeswoman for  Mountain View , California-based Google in
Spain, who asked not to be named citing company policy, declined
to elaborate on its statement. A representative from Spain’s tax
authorities declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
