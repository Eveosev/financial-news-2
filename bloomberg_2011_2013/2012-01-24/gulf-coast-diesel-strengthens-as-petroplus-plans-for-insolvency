Gulf Coast  diesel strengthened on
speculation that  Europe  will import more fuel after  Petroplus
Holdings AG (PPHN) , the largest independent European refinery, said it
expects to file for insolvency.  Petroplus is processing 115,000 barrels a day, about half
of its capacity, at the Coryton plant in the U.K., according to
a company official who declined to be identified because he
isnâ€™t authorized to speak to the media. Loadings at the refinery
and the distribution of products around the U.K. have been
disrupted, the company official said.  The discount for ultra-low-sulfur  diesel  on the Gulf Coast
versus heating oil futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  narrowed 0.33 cent to 2.5 cents a gallon at 2:16 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 0.74 cent to $3.0002 a gallon.  Coryton is producing about 100,000 metric tons a month, or
25,000 barrels a day, of ultra-low-sulfur diesel, the Petroplus
official said.  Petroplus said on Jan. 5 the Coryton plant was operating at
45 percent of capacity.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast (MOSGC87P)  widened 1.25 cents to 3.5 cents a gallon. Prompt
delivery rose 1.09 cents to $2.7759.  To contact the reporter on this story:
