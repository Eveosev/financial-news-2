Naresh Takkar, managing director of
ratings company ICRA Ltd. in  New Delhi , comments on the  Reserve
Bank  of India’s decision today to reduce the cash reserve  ratio 
by 50 basis points to 5.5 percent. He commented in an e-mail.  “The preference for a CRR cut as opposed to further open-
market operations seems to be aimed at improving the confidence
levels of industry and market players given the moderation of
economic growth.  ‘‘Given the RBI’s concerns that rupee depreciation and
adjustment in prices of fuel items on account of suppressed
inflation may stoke inflationary pressures, we expect the
central bank to refrain from announcing further open-market
purchases of  government securities  in the near term and embark
on monetary easing in April 2012.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
