Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  is rated more highly than French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  on all major policy issues less than three months before
presidential elections, a BVA poll showed.  Hollande was rated as “more credible” than Sarkozy to
deal with economic growth, public debt, jobs, purchasing power,
poverty, taxes, education, crime and immigration, according to
the poll published today in newspaper  Le Parisien . On crime and
immigration, far-right candidate Marine Le Pen was rated the
most credible of all.  The only area where Sarkozy came out ahead was in a
question about who has the most “stature” of a president.
Sarkozy led with 46 percent ahead of 39 percent for Hollande. As
to who “has solutions for the problems of the French,”
Hollande was chosen by 41 percent and Sarkozy by 23 percent.  Hollande has consistently led Sarkozy in polls before the
first round of voting on April 22. The top two candidates from
the first round face off in the decisive contest May 6.  The BVA poll of 974 people was carried out Jan. 18-19. No
margin of error was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
