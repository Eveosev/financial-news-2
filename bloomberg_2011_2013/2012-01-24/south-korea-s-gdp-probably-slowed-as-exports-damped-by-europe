South Korea ’s economy probably grew
at a slower pace in the fourth quarter as the European debt
crisis damped demand for Asian exports, pressuring the nation’s
central bank to hold rates steady next month.  Gross domestic product  expanded 0.5 percent in the three
months through December from the prior quarter, when it gained
0.8 percent, according to the median of 10 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey  before a government report tomorrow at 8
a.m. in  Seoul . From a year earlier, the economy grew 3.5
percent, according to the median of 14 estimates.  South Korean policy makers, who kept the benchmark rate
unchanged at 3.25 percent for a seventh month on Jan. 13, have
said they’re cautious about raising  interest rates  as  Europe ’s
debt crisis hurts the global economic outlook and inflation
pressures at home persist.  China’s economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in 10 quarters in the fourth quarter, underscoring
how Europe’s woes are hitting South Korea’s trading partners.  “The central bank is likely to preserve its limited policy
buffer unless 2012 growth is projected to fall below 3 percent,
job losses mount and inflation expectations subside,” said Wai Ho Leong, a senior regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in
 Singapore . “The resilience in exports and employment lessens
the need for immediate policy support. At the same time,
inflation and inflation expectations remain too high for
comfort.”  Quarter-on-quarter economic growth of 0.5 percent would be
the  slowest  for South Korea since the three-month period ended
December 2010. Amid concerns the economy is slowing, Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo has described  interest rates  as
“accommodative,” adding they can’t remain so for long.  South Korea’s won completed its second weekly gain last
week, up 1.3 percent to 1134.21 per dollar. Markets in South
Korea were closed yesterday and Jan. 23 for the Lunar New Year
holiday. The benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI)  stock index rose 4 percent last
week.  Export Outlook  Overseas shipments rose 12.5 percent last month compared
with a year ago, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said on Jan.
1. The ministry forecast export growth will probably slow to 6.7
percent this year from 19.6 percent last year.  Some improving U.S. economic reports such as hiring,
manufacturing and car sales have outweighed concerns that the
downgrading of European nations by credit rating companies would
worsen the debt crisis.  Growth Forecasts  The average forecast for U.S. gross domestic product growth
this year has been rising since October. From a low of 2
percent, the median estimate in a survey of 72 economists has
climbed to 2.3 percent, including a 0.2-point increase on Jan.
12 that represented the biggest one-day gain since projections
for 2012 began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Closer to home, domestic consumption has held up amid job
and wage increases. Sales at major South Korean department
stores gained the most in eight months in December, according to
a government report on Jan. 18.  The  finance ministry  projected more than 280,000 jobs will
be added this year after an addition of 400,000 jobs in 2011.
The government will spend about 60 percent of its 2012 budget in
the first half to spur domestic demand, the ministry also said
last month.  The BOK forecast in December that the economy will grow 3.7
percent in 2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013 after a 3.8 percent
expansion in 2011. Consumer prices may increase 3.3 percent this
year after a 4 percent gain in 2011, according to the
projections.  The BOK’s Kim predicted growth will be little changed this
year compared with 2011 as domestic demand offsets an export
slowdown.  South Korea’s 30 biggest industrial groups plan to increase
total spending, including capital expenditure, by 12 percent in
2012 from last year, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said on
Jan. 13. Spending at the groups, including  Samsung Group  and  LG
Group , will rise to a record 151.4 trillion won ($131 billion)
and the groups will hire 123,000 new workers, up 2.2 percent
from 2011, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
