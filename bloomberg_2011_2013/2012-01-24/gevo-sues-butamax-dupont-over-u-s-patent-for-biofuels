Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , a maker of biofuels, sued
 DuPont Co. (DD)  and its business partner  Butamax Advanced Biofuels (0031863D) ,
in federal court in  Delaware  alleging infringement of a new
patent for alcohol fermentation processes.  The patent, awarded today to Englewood, Colorado-based
Gevo, covers methods for alcohol recovery at reduced cost,
according to its written description.  Gevo contends Butamax -- a joint venture between
Wilmington, Delaware-based DuPont and Britain’s BP Plc -- and
DuPont “perform the methods described” in the patent without
Gevo’s authorization and should pay unspecified damages after a
jury trial.  The companies have been sparring over biofuel  patent
rights . Last year, Gevo asked the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office to review validity of a Butamax patent for a fuel
additive, questioning who was first to invent the technology.  Gevo rose 8 cents to $6.94 in early Nasdaq trading today in
 New York . DuPont fell 41 cents to $48.94 in New York Stock
Exchange trading.  The case is Gevo v. Butamax, 12-cv-70 U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
