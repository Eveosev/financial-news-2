Switzerland ’s central bank must
maintain its “expansionary” monetary policy as inflation
pressures remain low because of the franc’s strength and cooling
global growth, the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development  said.  Based on the  Swiss National Bank ’s inflation forecast,
“monetary stimulus will therefore need to remain expansionary
for some time, unless the scenario underlying the inflation
projections changes, for example through a reversal of recent
exchange rate developments,” the Paris-based group said in a
report today. It also said that since  interest rates  may  remain
“unusually low and liquidity abundant, it is important that
macroprudential measures are taken in parallel to avoid
excessive mortgage lending.”  The SNB cut its  benchmark rate  to close to zero last year
and introduced a cap on the franc after it strengthened to a
record against the euro. The OECD forecast today that Swiss
economic growth will accelerate to 1.9 percent next year after
an 0.8 percent expansion in 2012, reiterating projections
published in November.  “Surveys indicate that most firms have so far accommodated
the appreciation” of the franc “by lowering margins and
therefore have not reduced the volume of production,” the OECD
said. Still, “there is a risk that even temporary large
exchange rate appreciation can have a permanent effect on
production supplied by these businesses, possibly resulting in
large welfare losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
