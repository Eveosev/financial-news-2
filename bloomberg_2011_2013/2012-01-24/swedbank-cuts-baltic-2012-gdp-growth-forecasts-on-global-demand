Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the largest lender in
the Baltic region, cut its 2012 economic-growth forecasts for
Estonia,  Latvia  and Lithuania, citing slowing global demand.  Estonia’s gross domestic product will probably expand 2.7
percent this year, compared with a previous forecast in October
of 3.3 percent, the bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Latvia’s economy may grow 2 percent, compared with 3 percent
seen earlier. Lithuania’s GDP will probably rise 3.3 percent,
down from an earlier outlook of 4.2 percent.  The bank still expects Latvia to adopt the euro in 2014,
while it said uncertainty regarding the timing of Lithuania’s
entry has increased.  To contact the reporter on this story:
