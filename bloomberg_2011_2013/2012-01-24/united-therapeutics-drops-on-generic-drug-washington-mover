United Therapeutics Corp. (UTHR)  fell as
much as 4.7 percent, the biggest intraday decline since
November, after the FDA said an unidentified company applied to
sell a generic version of its best-selling Remodulin drug.  The U.S. Food & Drug Administration said the application
includes a so-called Paragraph IV certification, which means the
company is claiming Remodulin patents are invalid or not
infringed. The patent doesn’t expire until 2014, though these
challenges are typically filed years in advance.  The  Silver Spring , Maryland-based company’s stock sank
$1.95 to $46.43 at 2:36 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market after
dropping as low as $46.12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
