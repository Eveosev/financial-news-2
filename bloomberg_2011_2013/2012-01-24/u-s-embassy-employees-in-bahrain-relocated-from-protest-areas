U.S. Embassy employees in  Bahrain 
who live near an area that has seen an increase in
demonstrations are being relocated to other neighborhoods, the
U.S. State Department said.  Rallies along the Budaiya Highway corridor have “led to
traffic disruptions, effectively restricting travel for those
living in the area,” according to a statement, posted on the
U.S. Embassy website. “The resulting inability to leave one’s
home for an extended period poses significant safety and
security concerns.”  Tensions in the island nation persist almost a year after
the start of demonstrations by mostly Shiite protesters
demanding a more representative government and greater rights
from the country’s  Sunni Muslim  rulers. At least 35 people died
during the February-March rallies and the subsequent government
crackdown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
