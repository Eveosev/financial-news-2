The total value of Japanese shares
bought through margin  transactions  fell the most since March 18,
the week of the nation’s record earthquake, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Total buying on margin in the week ended Jan. 20 fell by
7.6 percent to 1.22 trillion yen ($15.8 billion) from the
previous week. The value fell for a fifth consecutive week to
the lowest level since May 2009.  Total value of  short positions  held through margin accounts
gained for a third week, adding 19.7 billion yen to 570 billion
yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  last week gained 3.1 percent
to 8,766.36 as U.S. reports showed the world’s biggest economy
is recovering and falling European borrowing costs signaled the
debt crisis may be easing.  The data is for stocks traded on the first and second
sections of the  Tokyo , Osaka and Nagoya stock exchanges.  To contact the reporters on this story:
