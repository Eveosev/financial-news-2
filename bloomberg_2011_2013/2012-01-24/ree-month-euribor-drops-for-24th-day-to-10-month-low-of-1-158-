The  rate  at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros for three months declined
for a 24th day, according to the European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, for such loans
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.158
percent, EBF data showed. That’s the longest run of daily
declines since September 2009, and the  lowest  rate since March
3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The rate has fallen every trading day since the  European
Central Bank  allotted a record 489 billion euros ($489 billion)
of three-year loans to 523 banks on Dec. 21 to encourage lending
and prevent a credit shortage. The ECB is scheduled to conduct
its second longer-term refinancing operation next month.  “The persistent fall in Euribor rates is a reflection that
there is plenty of cash in the system and the prospect of more
to come with the next three-year LTRO,” said  Orlando Green , a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Agricole Corporate &
Investment Bank in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
