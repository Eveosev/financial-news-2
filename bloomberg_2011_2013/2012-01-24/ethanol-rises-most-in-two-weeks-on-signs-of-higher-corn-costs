Ethanol futures rose the most in two
weeks on speculation that production costs will increase with
more expensive corn.  Futures and corn advanced for the fourth straight day as
U.S. farmers withheld supplies on bets  export  demand will climb
due to dry, hot weather in  South America  that may have damaged
crops. U.S. ethanol producers rely on corn to make the biofuel.  “You’re watching fractions of cents right now,” said Mike
Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone Group in  Des Moines ,
Iowa. “Ethanol is a market that’s being reluctantly pulled
higher by corn.”  Denatured ethanol for February delivery advanced 2.2 cents,
or 1 percent, to $2.175 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since Jan. 11 and the biggest gain since Jan.
9. Prices have fallen 6.3 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.24 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  Chicago  increased 2 cents, or 1 percent, to
$2.13 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the alternative fuel added 1
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $2.22.  Corn for March delivery jumped 10.5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $6.3025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
