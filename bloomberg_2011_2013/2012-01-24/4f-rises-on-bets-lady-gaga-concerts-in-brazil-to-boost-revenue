T4F Entretenimento SA, the Brazilian
live-entertainment company whose name stands for Time For Fun,
headed for a one-month high after Banco BTG Pactual SA
reiterated its “buy” recommendation and said concerts by Lady Gaga and Madonna are boosting the outlook for revenue.  Shares gained 0.5 percent to 12.80 reais at 12:53 p.m in
 Sao Paulo , poised for the highest closing price since Dec. 26.
The benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.9 percent.  “Both Madonna and Lady Gaga have confirmed plans to
perform in the region in 2012 -- both are Live Nation artists
and thus can only tour in the region with T4F,” analysts from
Banco BTG Pactual SA including Carlos Sequeira said in a note to
clients today in which they reiterated a 12-month price target
for the shares of 23 reais.  T4F booked former Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters’s concerts
and Cirque du Soleil’s Varekai shows this year in  Brazil ,
according to a presentation on Nov. 8. The company plans to
sustain growth by arranging concerts for international and local
artists, promoting theater plays, artistic performances and
sports events such as a stock-car race, according to the
presentation. T4F posted an 85 percent increase in tickets sold
for live music events in the third quarter of 2011 from a year
earlier, it said in the presentation.  “We see a great buying opportunity ahead of what seems to
be a very strong year,” the BTG analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
