Croatia may annul a newly introduced
6 percent tax on revenue generated by mobile phone services by
May this year,  Poslovni Dnevnik  reported, citing Finance
Minister Slavko Linic.  The move would follow the introduction of fast mobile
Internet called  Long Term Evolution  technology by
telecommunications operators, which would increase government
concessions, according to Poslovni.  Parliament  on Jan. 20
approved a 6 percent tax on revenue from mobile phone services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
