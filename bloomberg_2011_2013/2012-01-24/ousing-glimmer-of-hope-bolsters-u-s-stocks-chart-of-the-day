Borrowing to buy homes is emerging
as a catalyst for U.S. stocks to rise, according to Gina  Martin Adams , a Wells Fargo & Co. strategist.  “Our favorite indicator of housing markets -- mortgage
purchase applications -- has provided a glimmer of hope” for an
industry recovery that will lead investors to buy shares, Martin
Adams wrote yesterday in a report.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares an application index from the
 Mortgage Bankers Association  with Freddie Mac’s national average
percentage rate for 30-year fixed mortgages. Both the gauges are
compiled weekly.  Applications have stopped falling along with  mortgage
rates , as the chart illustrates. In the week before last, the
index was 24 percent above a low reached in August even though
the 30-year rate dropped to a record.  Signs of a housing rebound may bolster confidence in the
prospects for economic growth, wrote Martin Adams, who is based
in  New York . Investors may then be more willing to take risks of
owning stocks.  “Housing still holds the cards” to lift the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index beyond an 8 percent gain this year, she wrote,
though a rallying dollar may limit any advance and moves in  oil
prices  may cause stocks to swing. Her year-end estimate for the
index is 1,360, or 16 points higher than the average projection
of a dozen strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
