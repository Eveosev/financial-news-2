The tanker industry is poised to
draw new investors as a plunge in ship prices bottoms out this
year and revenues for the biggest oil carriers surge fivefold
over the next four years, said McQuilling Services LLC.  Sales of tankers are set to climb as tumbling earnings spur
loan defaults and bankruptcies, the  Garden City , New York-based
consultancy said in an e-mailed annual report on the industry.
Global demand for crude tankers probably will rise by an average
of 1.5 percent annually over the next four years, lifting rates
starting in 2013, it said.  “Asset prices are at attractive levels and revenues are
arguably at historic lows,”  McQuilling  said. “Investors have
an attractive entry point at present, but should have enough
cash on hand to carry them through the remaining period of
depressed freight rates.”  Demand contracted by 2 percent last year, triggering a 9
percent drop in tanker values, according to the report. A glut
of the vessels weighed on earnings as a 10 percent increase in
the volume of oil imports into Asian countries failed to make up
for lower shipments to the  U.S. (APIICRUD)  and  Europe , it showed.  Returns for the global fleet of 562 very large crude
carriers, each able to haul 2 million barrels of oil, will
average $33,020 a day between 2012 and 2016, McQuilling
predicted. VLCCs hired for single voyages earned $5,797 daily
last year, sliding 79 percent from 2010, the most among the five
classes of tankers studied in the report.  Slower Growth  The VLCC fleet’s growth will slow starting next year, the
consultant said, citing fewer orders for new ships and greater
scrapping of older vessels. Forty new VLCCs entered service last
year and 47 more will join the fleet in 2012, it said.  Weaker expansion will boost VLCC revenues beyond a break-
even level calculated at $28,009 daily, according to McQuilling.
The purchase of a five-year-old tanker will return 17.9 percent
annually over 20 years based on projected and historical
revenues, according to the report.  “The next five years will be difficult, but improving for
the shipping industry,” McQuilling said. Events that disrupt
production or demand may affect markets, it said.  Suezmax tankers able to haul 1 million barrels of crude
will rent for an average $20,700 a day over the next four years,
compared with $15,018 in 2011, giving an investment return of
13.3 percent, McQuilling data show. Aframaxes that haul 600,000
million barrels will average $17,900 in that span, against
$4,772 in 2011, with an investment return calculated at 10.7
percent, the report showed.  Neither suezmaxes nor aframaxes will earn enough to cover
operating and finance costs between this year and 2016,
according to McQuilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
