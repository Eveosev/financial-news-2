Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  issued $1.7 billion of bonds to refinance debt sold to help
pay for its acquisition of Burlington Northern  Santa Fe .  Berkshire, which bought the railroad for $26.5 billion in
2010, sold $1.1 billion of five-year notes and $600 million of
10-year debentures, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Proceeds may be used to refinance $1.7 billion of bonds that
come due next month, the company said today in a filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.  Buffett is extending maturities on Berkshire’s debt as a
rally in U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds pushes yields to
about the lowest level in more than two months. The Omaha,
Nebraska-based company raised a total of $8 billion in the bond
market in February 2010 to pay for the acquisition, the biggest
in Buffett’s four-decade tenure as chief executive officer,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The five-year notes yield 100 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries and the 10-year debt pays a spread
of 137.5 basis points, the data show. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
managing today’s offering, according to the  SEC filing , which
didn’t specify the size of the offering or the bonds’ yields.  Berkshire is  ranked  Aa2, the third-highest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service and AA+ by
 Standard & Poor’s , one step higher. It was downgraded from AAA
by S&P on Feb. 4, 2010, the day it announced the bond offering
to pay for the Burlington Northern acquisition.  Outstanding Bonds  Berkshire’s $500 million of 3.75 percent notes due in
August 2021 traded yesterday at 104.7 cents on the dollar to
yield 3.17 percent, or a spread of 110 basis points, according
to Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  That compares with an average spread of 174 basis points on
corporate bonds rated in the AA tier and maturing in seven to 10
years, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Spreads on Berkshire’s bonds have narrowed 10 basis points to 67
versus a year ago, while the broader investment-grade corporate
 bond market  has widened by 74, the data show.  Yields on investment-grade company debt fell to 3.77
percent yesterday and touched 3.74 percent on Jan. 17, the
lowest level since Nov. 7, according to the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Master Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
