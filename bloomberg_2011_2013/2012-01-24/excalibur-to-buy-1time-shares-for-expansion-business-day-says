Excalibur Aerospace Proprietary
Ltd., which owns  South Africa â€™s low-cost airline Velvet Sky,
will buy more shares of 1Time Holdings Ltd. as part of its plan
to expand into  Africa , Business Day said.  Excalibur will boost holdings in 1Time beyond what it
originally planned, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited
Chairman Stephen Nthite as saying. An agreement to purchase 29.6
percent of 1Time shares ended last week, Business Day said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
