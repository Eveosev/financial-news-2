Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , the former state
monopoly, said a 300 million-euro ($390 million) impairment in
Belarus will have a “significant” impact on its 2011 net
income.  The impairment was triggered after Telekom  Austria  switched
its accounting to take hyperinflation into account in Belarus,
the Vienna-based company said today in a statement. The move
won’t affect its revenue or earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization forecasts.  Telekom Austria, which operates in seven eastern European
countries, cut its full-year targets in August after a drop in
the value of the Belarusian ruble. The company was cut one level
on Jan. 19 by Moody’s Investors Service after the company’s weak
operating performance strained the network operator’s finances.  A planned 38 cent per share dividend for 2011 and 2012
won’t be affected,  Telekom Austria  said. Management reiterated
it expects to announce full-year Ebitda up to 1.55 billion euros
on revenue of around 4.5 billion euros when it announces
earnings on Feb. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
