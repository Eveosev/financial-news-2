Following is the text of the U.S.
steel report from the Commerce Department:  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that preliminary December
steel imports were $2.2 billion (1.8 million metric tons).  This
was a decrease of 0.1 million metric tons from the preliminary
November totals of $2.4 billion (1.9 million metric tons).  The December change in steel imports based on metric tonnage
reflected decreases primarily in plates in coils and oil country
goods; an increase occurred primarily in line pipe greater than
16 inches in diameter. Decreases occurred primarily with  Belgium 
and the Netherlands; an increase occurred primarily with  Brazil .  The year to date final statistics through November 2011 showed
steel imports of 24.0 million metric tons compared with 20.0
million metric tons through November 2010. The largest commodity
increase occurred primarily in blooms, billets, and slabs. The
largest country increase occurred primarily with Brazil.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department      http://www.bea.gov   To contact the reporter on this story:
