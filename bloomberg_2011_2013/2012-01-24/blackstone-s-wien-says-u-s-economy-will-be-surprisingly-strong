Blackstone Group LP (BX) ’s  Byron Wien 
said the U.S. economy will expand 3 percent this year as
dwindling  joblessness  brightens consumers’ moods and companies
invest in new equipment.  “The economy is going to surprise on the upside,” Wien
said today during the Bloomberg Sovereign Debt Crisis Conference
in New York. Exports, business spending and improving consumer
attitudes will fuel economic growth in 2012, he said. At the
same time, the unemployment rate will drop below 8 percent
before year end, he projected.  Conrad DeQuadros, a senior economist at RDQ Economics LLC
in New York, who also spoke at the conference, said he expects 3
percent growth as well, driven by capital spending that
increases job creation and household purchases.  Julia Coronado , chief economist for  North America  at BNP
Paribas, also speaking on the panel, was less optimistic. She
projects growth in the world’s largest economy closer to 2
percent this year.  Cooling economies in Europe and Asia will impede the U.S.
expansion, said Coronado. The economy is still undergoing
“structural adjustments,” she said. The 0.6 percentage point
drop in joblessness over the past four months is mainly due to
people leaving the labor force, she said.  The U.S. economy will expand 2.3 percent in 2012, according
to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 72
economists in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
