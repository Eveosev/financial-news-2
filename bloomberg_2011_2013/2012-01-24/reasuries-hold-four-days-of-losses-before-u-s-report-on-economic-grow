Treasury 10-year yields fell from
almost the highest level in more than a month amid a stalemate
between regional policy makers and Greek bondholders over how to
resolve the nation’s debt crisis.  U.S. two-year notes were little changed as the government
prepared to sell $35 billion of the securities and the  Federal
Reserve  gathered to begin a two-day policy meeting.  “Greece is a background factor for headwinds to growth,”
said David Robin, an interest-rate strategist in  New York  at
Newedge USA LLC, an institutional-brokerage firm. “The
consensus view is that the Fed is going to extend the time line
for keeping its target rate low.”  The 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 2.04 percent at 8:50 a.m. in New York, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note maturing in
November 2021 traded up 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, at 99 21/32.  To contact the reporters on this story:
