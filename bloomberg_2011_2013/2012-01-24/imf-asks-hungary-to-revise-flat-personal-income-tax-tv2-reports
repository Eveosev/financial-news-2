The  International Monetary Fund 
unofficially asked Hungary to change its flat personal income
tax,  TV2  reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  The Washington-based multilateral lending agency asked the
government of Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  to introduce a second
 tax rate  or raise the single rate to 19 percent from 16 percent,
the television station said yesterday. The cabinet hasnâ€™t yet
taken a decision, TV2 reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
