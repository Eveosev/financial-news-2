Jones Day (1113L)  hired ex-U.S. Attorney
 Matthew D. Orwig  and two other litigators,  Basheer Y. Ghorayeb 
and  Shawn Cleveland , all formerly of  SNR Denton US LLP (1159L)  in
Dallas.  The moves will help  Jones Day  strengthen its litigation
team, the firm said today in a statement. All three will work as
partners out of the firm’s Dallas office, adding to the more
than 200 lawyers Jones Day employs in Houston and Dallas.  “Matt, Shawn and Basheer bring us formidable litigation
capabilities in white collar, securities, patent and other trial
and appellate areas, both here in Texas and firmwide,” said Pat Villareal, partner-in-charge of Jones Day’s Dallas office, in a
statement.  Orwig, 53, was a U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
Texas, based in Tyler, from 2001 to 2007. He was the managing
partner of SNR Denton’s Dallas office.  Ghorayeb, 35, was a member of Denton’s litigation and
arbitration practice.  Cleveland , 40, who also served on that
team, helped represent  Kenneth Lay , the late former chairman of
Enron Corp., in the civil and criminal cases that followed the
company’s collapse.  Jones Day, which has more than 2,500 lawyers worldwide, was
 ranked  as the seventh-highest-grossing law firm in 2010 by the
American Lawyer, a trade magazine, with more than
$1.62 billion in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
