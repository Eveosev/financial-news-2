State-owned  Kuwait  Oil Co. said it
put out a fire at a natural-gas pipeline caused by a leak at a
booster station.  “Production is not affected and operations aren’t
affected,” Abdul Khaleq Al-Ali, a company spokesman, said by
telephone today. The accident in western Kuwait, which slightly
injured four people, took place yesterday. The fire was
extinguished an hour after the incident occurred, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
