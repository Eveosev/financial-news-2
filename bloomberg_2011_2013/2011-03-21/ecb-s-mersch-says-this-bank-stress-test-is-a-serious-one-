European Central Bank council
member Yves Mersch said this year’s bank stress tests will be
tougher than last year’s.  “The next stress tests won’t be a test of the liquidity
but of the banks’ solidity,” Mersch told reporters at a press
conference in Luxembourg today. The tests will be “more
severe” than the previous ones and “I hope that the markets
will accept that this  stress test  is a serious one,” he said.  European Union regulators have yet to agree on which banks
to test as part of annual examinations of capital, or what the
passing grade will be, a month before an April deadline for
disclosure of stress-test methodology. Last year’s stress tests
were criticized for not being stringent enough because lenders
in the 27-nation region were shown by regulators to need only
3.5 billion euros ($4.9 billion) of new capital, about a 10th of
the lowest analyst estimate.  The  European Systemic Risk Board , the continent’s new risk
watchdog which is based at the ECB, on March 18 discussed the
role it could play in banking stress tests at its first regular
meeting. The results of the stress tests are due to be published
in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
