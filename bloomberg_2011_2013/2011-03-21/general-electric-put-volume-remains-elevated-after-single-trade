General Electric Co. (GE)  put volume
remained elevated today after being above the four-week average
every day last week, boosted by one trade with a strike price 39
percent below the March 18 close.  A block of 39,526 September $12 puts to sell the world’s
largest maker of power-generation equipment traded for 18 cents
each at 10:39 a.m. in New York, all at the ask price, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. An investor bought 45,000 of the
same puts on March 18. Today’s trade came from the same broker
as Friday’s,  Henry Schwartz , president of Trade Alert LLC, a New
York-based provider of options-market data and analytics, said.  More than 125,000 puts changed hands today, 1.6 times the
four-week average and 1.6 times the number of calls to buy. The
September $12 puts were the most traded and accounted for 46
percent of all put volume. Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE
gained 2.4 percent to $19.72 today and hasn’t fallen below $12
since July 2009.  “It looks like a protective hedge,” Schwartz said. “I
would expect it has to do with the exposure to the  Japan 
crisis.”  Governments from Germany to  India  are reassessing the
technology after Japan’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami
crippled a power plant and raised the threat of a meltdown.
Three reactors at Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant use a GE
design, including the damaged No. 1 unit.  China  on March 16
halted nuclear project approvals and plans safety inspections of
new facilities. GE last week fell 6.9 percent in three days,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
