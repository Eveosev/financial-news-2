Apollo Global Management LLC plans
to raise as much as $417 million in an initial offering as it
seeks to join private-equity firms Blackstone Group LP and KKR &
Co. on the  New York  Stock Exchange.  The firm is selling 18 million new shares for $17 to $19
each, the New York-based company said today. Banks underwriting
the offer have the option to buy an additional 3.94 million
shares, Apollo said in a statement.  Apollo will join KKR and Blackstone more than three years
after selling shares through a private exchange. KKR last year
moved trading of its shares to New York after combining with its
public fund. The firms are seeking outside shareholders after
the two-year  bull market  in stocks and a rally in credit markets
revived buyouts.  KKR has gained 59 percent since its July listing in New
York. Blackstone, which went public before the financial crisis,
has risen 64 percent over the same time period, though it’s
still trading 45 percent below its June 21, 2007, offering
price.  Apollo said it will use the proceeds for general corporate
purposes and to fund expansion plans. The firm, led by  Leon
Black , postponed the start of the offering last week after the
crisis in  Japan  spurred a plunge in global markets, two people
with knowledge of the offering said at the time.  Current shareholders plan to sell 8.26 million shares
existing shares as part of the offering. Apollo’s management and
employees are not selling at this time, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
