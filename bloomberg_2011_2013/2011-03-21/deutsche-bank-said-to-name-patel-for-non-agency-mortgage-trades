  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  named Jashin Patel
to lead trading of U.S. mortgage bonds without government-backed
guarantees, according to two people familiar with the decision.  Patel, 35, was in charge of trading a subset of the so-
called non-agency home-loan securities, including subprime debt,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
change wasn’t announced to the media. Patel and Amanda Williams,
a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based bank, declined to comment.  The position was last held by Jordan Milman, who left the
bank with traders including Greg Lippmann to start the hedge
fund LibreMax Capital LLC, the people said. Lippmann, who gained
fame for his bets against subprime-mortgage securities before
the financial crisis, is LibreMax’s chief investment officer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
