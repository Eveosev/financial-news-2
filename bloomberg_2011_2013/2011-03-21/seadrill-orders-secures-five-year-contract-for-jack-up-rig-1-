  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL) , the owner of the
world’s second-largest fleet of deepwater rigs, entered an
agreement for the construction of a jack-up drilling rig with
the Jurong shipyard in  Singapore .  The rig is scheduled to be completed at the end of the
third quarter of 2013, the Bermuda-based company said today in a
statement. The price is about $530 million, including project
management, drilling and handling tools, spares and capitalized
interest.  The rig has been contracted to  ConocoPhillips (COP)  for a five-
year period off Norway for about $680 million, Seadrill said.
The Jurong shipyard is owned by  Sembcorp Marine Ltd. (SMM)   “This newbuild is an important addition to our fleet of
harsh-environment drilling units which will increase earnings
and employment visibility of our operations in this region,”
Alf Thorkildsen, chief executive officer of Seadrill, said in
the statement.  Seadrill rose as much as 1.9 percent to 203.8 kroner in
Oslo trading, and was at 203.5 kroner as of 10:26 a.m. local
time. The shares are up 3.7 percent this year, after gaining 33
percent last year.  The contract is subject to government approval of the plan
for development and operations for Ekofisk South and Eldfisk II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
