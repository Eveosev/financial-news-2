PetroEcuador, the South American
country’s state-owned oil company, said its 20,000 barrel-a-day
Shushufindi oil refinery is operating at full capacity after
workers replaced one of two distillation units.  Output returned to normal after the unit was tested this
weekend, a PetroEcuador official, who cannot be identified
because of company policy, said today by telephone. The unit
produces half of the refinery’s daily output of gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel.  Damages at Shushufindi and planned repairs at Esmeraldas,
the nation’s largest refinery, have forced the country to
increase fuel purchases to supply local demand, Chief Executive
Officer Marco Calvopina said Feb. 7. Plans to take the
Esmeraldas refinery’s catalytic cracker unit offline for seven
months beginning in March 2012 will “significantly affect
output” and lead to increased imports, he said.  Fuel output at Shushufindi, located in the Amazon province
of Sucumbios near the Colombian border, was cut in half by a
Jan. 16 explosion that destroyed a distillation unit.  Esmeraldas, which has a 110,000 barrel-a-day capacity, is
producing about 90,000 barrels a day as it undergoes
maintenance, the official said.  Ecuador’s three refineries have a combined processing
capacity of 176,000 barrels of fuel a day, according to
PetroEcuador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
