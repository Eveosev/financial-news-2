German utilities may not pay into a
government fund to develop renewable power during a three-month
halt of the country’s oldest nuclear energy facilities,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported without citing the source of the
information.  During the governement-ordered halt, power companies are
due to pay 27 million euros to the fund, which was set up as
part of an agreement to extend the lifespan of  Germany ’s nuclear
reactors, the paper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
