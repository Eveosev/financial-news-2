  New Zealand  Prime Minister John Key
said he doesn’t plan to impose land or capital-gains taxes to
make up for a revenue shortfall, rejecting a recommendation from
the  International Monetary Fund .  “They’re off the table from our point of view,” Key told
reporters in Wellington today. The Washington-based IMF is
advising the government to broaden the tax base, interest.co.nz
reported today, citing comments from Ray Brooks, mission chief
for  Australia  and New Zealand.  New Zealand expects its  budget deficit  will be NZ$5 billion
($3.7 billion) wider as a result of costs and additional
spending after a Feb. 22 earthquake that killed more than 160,
wrecking homes, roads and commercial buildings in Christchurch,
the nation’s second-biggest city. Key said the government will
cut spending programs rather than raise new taxes.  Land taxes have “an impact on every single land owner in
New Zealand,” he said. “I wouldn’t have thought we’d want to
do that on the back of a very weak housing market at the
moment.”  Capital-gains taxes “don’t produce you a lot of revenue up
front so wouldn’t pay for the earthquake, and in our view are an
inefficient form of taxation,” he said.  The government rejected both forms of taxation last year
after they were proposed by an independent working group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
