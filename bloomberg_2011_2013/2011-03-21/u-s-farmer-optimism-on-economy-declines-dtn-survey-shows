U.S. farmers are less optimistic
about their current and future economic situation than they
were in December, according to a survey-based index produced by
 DTN/The Progressive Farmer .  Farmers gave their present economic circumstances an index
score of 111, down from 151 in December, with 100 indicating
sentiment in the benchmark month of April 2010, the
agricultural news service said today. The April survey was the
first conducted by the unit of Madrid-based  Telvent GIT SA. (TLVT) 
Growers gave a rating of 91 for their outlook for the economy
one year from now, down from 117 in December.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is predicting a 20
percent jump in net-farm income this year to a record $94.7
billion. Farm exports will jump 25 percent to $135.5 billion in
fiscal 2011, the highest ever, the USDA said last month. Still,
higher  oil prices  and possible economic disruption related to  Japan ’s earthquake have pushed prices for corn, wheat and
soybeans traded in Chicago down at least 6.1 percent from last
month’s highs for the year.  The pre-harvest Agriculture Confidence Index was compiled
after surveying 500 farmers and ranchers, DTN said. The
sampling reflected the major types, sizes and locations of
agricultural operations as reported in the 2007 USDA Census of
Agriculture, DTN said.  The survey is done three times a year: before planting and
then before and after harvest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
