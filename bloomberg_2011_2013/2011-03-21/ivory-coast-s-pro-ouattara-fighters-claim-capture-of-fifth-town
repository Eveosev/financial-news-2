An armed group that supports  Ivory
Coast ’s President-elect Alassane Ouattara captured a fifth town
in the western part of the country, a spokesman said today.  “We entered into the town of Blolequin at 8 a.m. this
morning after fighting all night” against troops loyal to
incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo , said Lass Com, a member of
the New Forces group of fighters. “The combat was very violent,”
he said by phone from the town of Man.  Guillaume Soro, Ouattara’s appointed prime minister,
ordered the fighters to secure the far  western part  of the
world’s top cocoa producer, Com said.  Gbagbo refuses to cede power to Ouattara following a
disputed Nov. 28 election. He alleges electoral fraud in parts
of the north while Ouattara is internationally recognized as the
winner of the vote.  To contact the reporters on this story:
