The U.S. Army apologized publicly
after German magazine  Der Spiegel  published photographs that
appear to show U.S. soldiers posing with the corpse of a
civilian in  Afghanistan .  Two photos published in Spiegel yesterday show two
soldiers, one smiling, as they hold up the head of a corpse
identified as an Afghan civilian. A third shows two corpses
propped up against a white post with their hands bound together.
Spiegel said it published three out of 4,000 photos and videos
it obtained during a five-month investigation.    Der Spiegel  published photographs depicting actions
repugnant to us as human beings and contrary to the standards
and values of the United States Army,” Colonel Thomas Collins,
an Army spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement today. “We
apologize for the distress these photos cause.”  The publication breaches a protective order issued by
military officials as part of courts-martial scheduled to begin
this week that will try five soldiers accused of killing Afghan
civilians in Kandahar province last year, the  Associated Press 
reported. The soldiers caught up in the war-crimes probe have
been charged with murder and conspiracy, AP said.  The photographs recall pictures that emerged in 2004
depicting mistreatment by U.S. military personnel against
detainees in  Iraq ’s Abu Ghraib prison.  They also threaten to compound tension between NATO and
Afghan President  Hamid Karzai , who has stepped up his criticism
of civilian casualties. U.S. helicopter crews killed nine Afghan
boys who were cutting firewood on a mountainside this month,
prompting hundreds of Afghans to march in Kabul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
