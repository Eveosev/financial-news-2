  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
home lender, paid Chief Executive Officer  John Stumpf  about
$19 million in compensation for 2010, when the bank’s stock
climbed 15 percent.  Stumpf, 57, received $3.2 million in salary, $11 million in
stock awards and $3.3 million in non-equity incentive
compensation, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in a
filing. Wholesale-banking chief Dave Hoyt got $12.8 million,
while Mark Oman, head of consumer and mortgage finance, was paid
$9.7 million.  Wells Fargo was given permission by regulators to raise its
dividend last week, when it announced a special 7-cent payout
and gained authority to buy back an additional 200 million
shares. The  Federal Reserve  ordered 19 of the largest U.S.
lenders to test the performance of their loans, securities and
capital against possible economic outcomes under a second round
of stress tests.  Wells Fargo declined 7 cents to $31.76 as 3:23 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, and has gained about 2.5
percent this year.  Howard Atkins, the former chief financial officer who
stepped down last month, received $9.3 million for 2010,
including $1.7 million in incentive compensation, Wells Fargo
said. The bank announced on Feb. 8 that Atkins was taking an
unpaid leave of absence and would retire for personal reasons.  Atkins’ “leadership was a significant factor in the
company’s financial success and rigorous stewardship of our
stockholders’ investments,” Wells Fargo said in today’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
