A survey showed 79 percent of
Mexicans want controls on the country’s southern border to
impede illegal immigration, the  Mexico  City newspaper  El
Universal  reported.  Of the 2,400 people surveyed last year by the Centro de
Investigacion y Docencia Economicas, a Mexican university known
as  CIDE , 66 percent agreed that undocumented immigrants should
be deported from Mexico, El Universal reported.  Thirty-four
percent said foreigners should be able to enter Mexico without
obstacles, the newspaper said.  In the survey, 22 percent favored building a wall on
Mexico’s southern border. The survey results also showed that 86
percent said it was important for immigrants who reside in
Mexico to speak Spanish, and 81 percent said they should have a
good level of education, El Universal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Thomas Black  in Monterrey at
