A  San Francisco  revival of Harold Pinter’s ambiguous 1965 drama “The Homecoming” is generating
laughs and cringes as it explores the horrors of family
relationships.  Retired butcher Max and his son Lenny are trading nasty
insults when the curtain rises. Soon they’re joined by Max’s
wimpy brother, Sam, a chauffeur, and then by Max’s lunkhead
third son, Joey, a would-be boxer. Recalling his time at the
racetrack, Max loves bragging about himself as much as needling
his relatives.  “I had an instinctive understanding of animals,” he
boasts. “I had a gift.” Soon after, he’s picking on his
brother. “Funny a man like you, Sam, never got married.”  The prodigal of the title is Max’s second son, Teddy, a
philosophy professor in the U.S. who’s visiting his family home
in North  London  with his wife, Ruth. They enter in the middle of
the night, after everyone’s gone to bed.  “There’s no need to be nervous,” Teddy says. “They’re
very warm people, really. Very warm. They’re my family. They’re
not ogres.”  Ruth starts to act a bit strange when she doesn’t want to
go upstairs to bed with Teddy and instead takes a walk in the
neighborhood, where she grew up. She returns to find Lenny
waiting for her, and things get stranger as Ruth and he thrust
and parry over a glass of water.  Ruth’s Choice  By the next day, the situation unravels further. Teddy
abruptly decides to return to America, while Ruth considers
staying behind in London, abandoning her three young sons in the
U.S. For no obvious reason, she starts flirting (and more) with
Teddy’s brothers and considers taking up residence in a Soho
flat that the smarmy Lenny offers to provide. Lenny, a pimp in a
blue pin-striped suit, evidently expects her to cover the rent
by working part-time on her back.  The production is well-mounted, with an evocative set by
Daniel Ostling and a solid cast, mostly from  American
Conservatory Theater ’s resident company.  Jack Willis makes a formidable Max, even if his accent
occasionally drifts away from working-class English. Andrew Polk
as Lenny provides just the right oily charm. As Ruth, the
usually excellent Rene Augesen should have asked director Carey Perloff that old question, “What’s my motivation?”  Ruth’s bizarre behavior at the end of the play isn’t
foreshadowed enough in her earlier scenes of repressed
flirtation with the brothers. She remains a mystery, which no
doubt is as Pinter intended it.  Through March 27 at 415 Geary St., San Francisco.
