Porsche SE, the German automaker
merging with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , will sell the 918 Spyder hybrid
sports car, its most expensive model ever, for $845,000 in  North
America  and limit production to 918 vehicles.  The first cars, available for order from today, will be
delivered to buyers beginning in November 2013, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based company said in a statement. The vehicle will sell
in  Europe  for 768,062 euros ($1.09 million).  The Porsche plug-in hybrid is part of a wave of green
supercars as luxury-car makers try to make fuel efficiency
palatable for their customers. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the
luxury-car leader, is developing the i8, a hybrid sports-car
that will have carbon-dioxide emissions similar to a compact
vehicle. Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz plans to roll out a battery-
powered version of the gull-wing SLS supercar from 2013.  “Performance green cars are a very necessary statement for
the premium brands about what this technology means to them,”
said Christoph Stuermer, a Frankfurt-based analyst with IHS
Automotive. While mass-market carmakers are concerned about the
costs of owning electric cars, “the premium brands seem more
worried about the fun part.”  The two-seater Porsche hybrid will accelerate to 100
kilometers (62 miles) an hour in 3.2 seconds and soar to a top
speed of 320 kilometers per hour, relying on a 500-horsepower V8
engine and 218-horsepower electric drive system that allow the
vehicle to run more than 25 kilometers on electric power. The
car’s lithium-ion battery can be recharged from a conventional
power outlet in  Germany  in three hours.  Adding Models  Porsche is developing the hybrid vehicle at a research
facility near Stuttgart. The car will be built at the main
Zuffenhausen plant. Porsche is adding models to meet a goal of
doubling the company’s annual sales to as many as 150,000
vehicles over the medium term and benefit from savings from the
planned combination with Volkswagen.  The Spyder hybrid is stylistically based on the Carrera GT
supercar as well as the 917 and RS Spyder. The car will have a
safety frame reinforced with carbon fiber and a manual roof
system with removable panels that can be stowed in the front 
lugggage compartment, Porsche said today.  “There’s certainly a number of collectors that have the
means to buy a model that you know is going to be a classic of
the future,” said IHS’s Stuermer. Still, selling nearly a
thousand may be “a bit of a stretch,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
