  Saudi Cable Co. (SCACO)  surged the most
since June 2009 after the manufacturer of cables and reels said
first-quarter profit is “very likely to surpass” that of the
same period last year and may exceed fourth-quarter net income.  The shares soared 8.8 percent to 12.95 riyals at 1:01 p.m.
in Riyadh trading.  The company has orders for as much as 384 million riyals
($102 million) this year, the Jeddah-based company said in a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
