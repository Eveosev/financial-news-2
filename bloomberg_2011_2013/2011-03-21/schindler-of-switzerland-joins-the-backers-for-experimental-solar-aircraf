  Schindler Holding AG (SCHN) , the worldâ€™s
second-largest maker of elevators, said today that the
Hergiswil, Switzerland-based company would help support Solar
Impulse, the experimental aircraft that aims to fly around the
world propelled only by sun-powered energy.  Backers for the Solar Impulse project, which last July
became the first aircraft to fly night and day for 26 hours
without fuel or polluting emissions, include  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,
Omega, EPFL and Dassault-Aviation, the company said in an e-
mail. Almost 12,000 solar cells were integrated into the wings.  The project is aiming to fly around the world without fuel
in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
