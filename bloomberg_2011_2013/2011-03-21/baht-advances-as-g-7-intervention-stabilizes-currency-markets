  Thailand ’s baht rose on speculation
intervention by the Group of Seven nations to curb the yen’s
rally following the earthquake and nuclear crisis in  Japan  will
stabilize markets, boosting demand for emerging-market assets.  The yen weakened for a second day after the G-7 issued a
joint statement on March 18 saying the U.S., the U.K.,  Canada 
and the  European Central Bank  will join Japan in concerted
intervention in foreign-exchange markets. The MSCI Asia-Pacific
Index of regional shares rose for a second day.  “The G-7 agreement provided some relief that the major
economies will work together to avoid financial-market
instability, supporting emerging-market currencies, including
the baht,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a foreign-exchange trader at
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in Bangkok. “A recovery in stock
markets also made it easier for investors to take risks.”  The baht gained 0.1 percent to 30.30 per dollar as of 3:21
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency may trade between 30.20 and 30.45 this week, Hasegawa
said.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive a floating payment, dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 2.51 percent.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015 rose
three basis points to 3.32 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
