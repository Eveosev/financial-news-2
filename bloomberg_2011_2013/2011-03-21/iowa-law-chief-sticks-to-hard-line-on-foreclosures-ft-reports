Tom Miller,  Iowa ’s state attorney-
general, said he’s sticking to a plan to compel banks to write
down the principal balances on some  mortgage loans , the
Financial Times reported.  Miller, who is leading a nationwide inquiry into improper
foreclosure practices, said that, while he’s willing to hear
from banks on how this might be done, “we’re not depending on
them to come up with a solution,” the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
