Soybean farmers in  Brazil , the
world’s second-biggest exporter of the oilseed, lost about 1.8
million metric tons after heavy rain damaged crops and slowed
the harvest, a weather forecaster said.  Above-average rainfall in Mato Grosso, the country’s top
producing region, damaged about 800,000 tons, or 4 percent of
the state’s expected output this year, said Marco Antonio dos
Santos, a forecaster for Somar Meteorologia in  Sao Paulo .
Precipitation may have destroyed an additional 700,000 tons in
northern Mato Grosso do Sul state and 300,000 tons in parts of
Goias, he said.  Soybean prices rose 2.1 percent in Chicago last week on
concern wet weather would pare Brazilian supplies. The price has
risen 41 percent in the past year on record Chinese demand for
soybeans from the U.S., the world’s largest grower. Soybean
farmers in Brazil will harvest an estimated 70.3 million tons
this year, up from 68.7 million tons last year, the Agriculture
Ministry said on March 10.  “Rains tend to continue until April, so we may see more
damage in crops,” dos Santos said.  Mato Grosso do Sul received 524 millimeters (21 inches) of
rain in March through yesterday, more than three times the
average for the entire month, Santos said. Mato Grosso had 20
days of rain in a 30-day period through today, preventing
farmers from harvesting, Santos said.  Soybean farmers in Mato Grosso harvested 67 percent of the
crop as of March 17, less than 93 percent harvested on the same
period a year earlier because of rains, the state’s crop
research institute, known as Imea, said on March 18. Growers in
Mato Grosso do Sul harvested 53 percent of the crop, compared
with 90 percent a year earlier, dos Santos said.  Soybean futures for May delivery rose half a cent to $13.63
a bushel today on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
