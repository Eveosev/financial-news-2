John Price, a consultant on
industrial accidents and former safety policy staffer at the
U.K.’s National Nuclear Corp., said  Japan  is making progress in
cooling its damaged nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant as water is dumped on the units. He spoke by telephone
from Melbourne.  On the water levels at Units 1, 2 and 3:  “At the moment the water level appears to be stable
although low and in actual fact it may have gone up slightly
over the weekend. That says the sea water injection does seem to
be working.”  On the fuel pond at Unit 4:  “I think if the spent fuel pond at Unit 4 was going to
cause trouble it would have already done so.”  On fuel rod damage:  “The fuel rods themselves are about 4.7 meters long and
that means that the top quarter of them have been exposed for
some time, so they’re damaged.”  “Damage is possibly not melting, it’s possibly oxidation
of the fuel canister.”  On the next steps:  The next steps are to “keep water levels stable. Every bit
of water is useful, everything will slowly cool down. The
question is, what to do in the longer period of time?”  Tokyo Electric “will have to design a way of protecting
the workers and then deciding whether to put buildings around”
the reactors.  “People have been talking about pouring concrete over it
like they did at Chernobyl. I think that’s certainly something
they won’t do because they have some hope of removing these
reactors completely. The situation is getting better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
