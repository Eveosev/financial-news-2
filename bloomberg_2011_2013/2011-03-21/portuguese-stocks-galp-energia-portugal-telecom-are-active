Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index (PSI20)  rose 0.9
percent to 7,935.61 at 1:14 p.m. in Lisbon, poised for a second
gain.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.    Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  , Portugal’s biggest oil
company, rose 0.8 percent to 15.095 euros. Oil climbed as allied
air strikes in Libya threatened to prolong a supply outage in
Africa’s third-biggest producer and renewed concern that
escalating turmoil may disrupt Middle East exports.    Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PTC)  , Portugal’s biggest
telecommunications company, advanced 3 percent to 8.375 euros.
Deutsche Telekom AG shares surged as much as 16 percent after
the company agreed to sell its U.S. wireless unit to AT&T Inc.
for $39 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
