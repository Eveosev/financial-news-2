Polskie Koleje Panstwowe SA called
for bids to buy its freight-carrying unit PKP Cargo SA, the
Polish state railway company said in an announcement today in
Rzeczpospolita newspaper.  The potential buyers will need to pledge investments in
Warsaw-based PKP Cargo and will need to buy new issue shares to
provide the capital for spending. The new owner will hold not
more than 50 percent plus one share in the company after the new
shares sale. Investors have until May 12 to place initial bids.  Polskie Koleje hired  Bank Zachodni WBK SA (BZW)  to advise on the
sale.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
