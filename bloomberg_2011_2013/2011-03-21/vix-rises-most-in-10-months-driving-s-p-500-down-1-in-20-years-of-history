JPMorgan Chase & Co. derivatives
strategist Davide Silvestrini told clients last month that
stocks had risen too much to pass up options that would protect
them should the gains reverse.  “Risks due to external shocks remain, such as soaring
commodity prices and potential policy missteps in emerging
markets to counter the high inflation,” Silvestrini wrote in a
Feb. 16 note, when the price of equity contracts was close to a
three-year low. “The strength of the rally has raised questions
about over-extension.”  After  Japan ’s earthquake spurred the biggest surge in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index in 10 months, it
may be too late to take his advice.  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S.
equity strategist at UBS AG, says rising earnings will revive
the rally that’s lifted the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 89
percent in two years. Northern Trust Corp.’s John Skjervem says
bulls will have to wait as investors assess the economic impact
of the Asian quake and resulting tsunami.  “With the stock market up about 26 percent over the last
six months and much more over the last couple years, the
question is, did the market get exhausted?” Golub said. The  S&P
500  rose 28 percent between Aug. 26 and Feb. 18. “The answer
isn’t based on the price action of the market, it’s based on
valuation,” he said. “Did stocks become expensive? The answer
is absolutely not.”  Market Peak  The S&P 500 retreated 1.9 percent to 1,279.20 last week
amid concern reactors damaged in Japan’s worst earthquake on
record would leak radiation and cripple the world’s third-
largest economy. The decrease dragged the index down 4.8 percent
from the 2011 high of 1,343.01 on Feb. 18 and lowered the
valuation to 15 times reported earnings, compared with a five-
decade average of 16.4, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
index climbed 1.5 percent to 1,298.38 at 4 p.m. in  New York .  The VIX, derived from the price of S&P 500 options, soared
39 percent on March 15 and 16 for the biggest two-day gain since
May, when the volatility index reached its 2010 peak of 45.79.
The benchmark gauge for U.S. stocks lost 1 percent on average in
the next month after comparable increases since 1990, data
compiled by Harrison, New York-based research firm Bespoke
Investment Group LLC show.  Options Prices  The cost of an option to protect against the S&P 500
dropping 10 percent over a month more than doubled in three
days. When the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund closed at
$130.84 on March 11, the April $118 put cost 49 cents, or 0.4
percent as much as the ETF. The contract surged 231 percent
through March 16 to $1.62, or 1.3 percent of the ETF’s price.  Traders are speculating volatility will climb, pushing the
cost of 30-day S&P 500 options higher than three-month contracts
for the first time since June. The VIX moves in the opposite
direction of the stock index 77 percent of the time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  From its 2011 low of 15.46 on Jan. 14, the VIX has gained
58 percent to 24.44. It traded below 16 in April, just before
 Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis sent the S&P 500 down 16 percent
in 10 weeks. After equities peaked on April 23, the VIX took
less than four weeks to reach last year’s high of 45.79 on May
20. By then, the S&P 500 had lost 12 percent.  Cash Cushion  “Once there’s been a shock, everyone goes to work figuring
out what the economic impact is, and it takes a while to know if
it’s going to slow growth or compress profit margins,” said
Skjervem, who helps manage $155 billion as Chicago-based chief
investment officer at Northern Trust Personal Financial
Services. “Most people are fully invested and don’t have the
cash cushion they normally would, so when something like this
happens they either sell positions or buy some protection.”  Concern about losses tied to the Japan quake pushed options
prices for  Coach Inc. (COH) ,  Aflac Inc. (AFL)  and  Hartford Financial
Services Group Inc. (HIG)  to the highest levels in at least seven
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stocks
gained an average of 52 percent from their August lows through
their February peaks, the data show.  Aflac lost 8.8 percent last week. The Columbus, Georgia-
based insurer got 76 percent of 2010 revenue from Japan, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Coach declined 11 percent. The New
York-based company got 20 percent of sales in Japan during
fiscal 2010. Hartford dropped 7.6 percent on concern it is
losing money in the Japanese stock market.  Surprised  “I’m surprised that the VIX is not at 40,” said  Frederic Dickson , who manages $28 billion as chief market strategist at
D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. “The VIX is really
a coincident indicator so it’s saying that we’re in a period of
uncertainty.”  Prices for protection in the options market surged around
the world as the MSCI All-Country World Index of shares in 45
nations lost 3.8 percent from March 11 to March 16, its biggest
retreat since August. The VStoxx Index, which measures Euro
Stoxx 50 Index options, rose 43 percent to a more than seven-
month high of 35.23, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index, a gauge of
Japanese option prices, almost tripled in two days to a two-year
high of 69.88 while the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  index fell the most since
1987, the data show. A gauge of currency volatility for Group of
Seven nations jumped to a nine-month high last week. The
JPMorgan G7 Volatility Index, which tracks three-month options,
surged 34 percent in the first three days of last week to 13.95.  “Markets looked fairly complacent about risks,” said Gary Baker, an equity strategist at Bank of America Corp. Money
managers worldwide were in February more bullish on stocks in a
monthly survey conducted by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
bank than at any time in the past decade.  Civil War  The price of options protection remained near a three-year
low even as rioting in  Egypt  led to the ouster of President
Hosni Mubarak, a civil war broke out between Libyan rebels and
 Muammar Qaddafi ,  China  boosted bank reserves to fight inflation
and concern grew that Europe’s debt crisis isn’t solved. In the
U.S., Federal Reserve officials signaled they’re unlikely to
expand a $600 billion bond purchase plan when it ends in June.  The S&P 500 gained 0.4 percent on March 18 after the Fed
allowed some banks to boost dividends and stock buybacks and
 Libya  called a cease-fire, which was violated after markets
closed. Jeff Bingaman, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Energy
Committee, said Japan’s nuclear emergency, while “very
significant and serious,” is no repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster in Ukraine. Bingaman is a Democrat from New Mexico.  ‘Black Swan’  Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, a strategist at ING
Investment Management, says investors couldn’t have been
prepared for Japan’s disaster. He referred to the event as a
“black swan,” a term coined by author and investor Nassim Taleb in 2007 to describe rare occurrences that disrupt a normal
order.  “You prepare yourself for gray swans that are unlikely but
at least you can imagine them,” said  The Hague , Netherlands-
based Van Nieuwenhuijzen, who helps oversee $529 billion. “The
black swans are the ones that cause most of the damage.”  More professional investors were betting on equity gains in
January than at any time since 2007, according to data compiled
by TrimTabs Investment Research and BarclayHedge Ltd. A gauge
indicating how much hedge funds are invested in stocks rose to
33 percent in January, the last month data are available, from
the 29 percent average since 2000, the March 4 data showed.  Five Quarters  S&P 500 earnings have increased for the past five quarters.
Analysts estimate they’ll expand another 14 percent this year
and climb above $100 a share in 2012 for the first time ever,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. At the same time, the  U.S.
economy , the world’s largest, will expand 3.1 percent this year,
the fastest since 2005, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Global gross domestic product will expand 4.4 percent this
year and 4.5 percent in 2012, according to the Washington-based
 International Monetary Fund .  As equities almost doubled over two years, options
insurance became less attractive, according to a March 10 report
from Citigroup Inc. in New York. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-
Term Futures ETN, an exchange-traded product tracking VIX
futures that is used to offset stock declines by speculators,
has lost 91 percent of its value since it started trading in
January 2009.  “Investors are tired of being told to hedge against risks
that have not emerged,” Citigroup currency strategists led by
Steven Englander in New York wrote March 10, the day before
Japan’s 9-magnitude earthquake.  Roil Markets  Two weeks after his Feb. 16 note, Silvestrini told clients
to buy puts on the S&P 500, the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  and
 Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index. Rising oil prices, revolts in the
Middle East and northern  Africa , inflation and sovereign-debt
risk in Europe all were “sources of risk which have the
potential to roil equity markets,” he said.  “Moving upward uninterrupted in a short period of time --
that’s not the normal pattern,” said Stephen Wood, the New
York-based chief market strategist for Russell Investments,
which manages $155 billion and forecasts that the S&P 500 will
climb 9.1 percent this year. “By the end of year, we’ll grind
up in a choppy way to a reasonable return.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
