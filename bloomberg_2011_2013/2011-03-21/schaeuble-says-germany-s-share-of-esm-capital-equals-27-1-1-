The European Stability Mechanism,
the permanent backstop for the euro from 2013, will be made up
of 80 billion euros ($113.8 billion) in paid-in capital and 620
billion euros in callable funds, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.    Germany ’s capital share will be 27.1 percent, Schaeuble
told reporters today after a meeting of European Union finance
ministers in Brussels. Half of ESM capital must be paid in by
2013 and the rest later in three annual installments, he said.  “The common European currency is mainly in Germany’s
interest,” Schaeuble said as he revealed Germany’s
contribution, the biggest of any euro-region member. “The
failure of the European currency -- and the exit of one member
would be such a failure -- would have incalculable consequences
for Germany.”  German coalition lawmakers appealed to  Chancellor Angela Merkel  last week to seek parliamentary approval for any future
aid for distressed euro-area states, saying taxpayers must be
shielded from further debt-crisis fallout. Merkel, whose party
has five more state elections to contest this year, faces public
opposition to aid for debt-strapped neighbors.  Any aid will be subject to strict conditions and will only
be granted if the stability of the euro region as a whole is at
risk, Schaeuble said. So-called collective action clauses will
ensure that investors in  government bonds  make an “adequate
contribution” in any debt restructuring, Schaeuble said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
