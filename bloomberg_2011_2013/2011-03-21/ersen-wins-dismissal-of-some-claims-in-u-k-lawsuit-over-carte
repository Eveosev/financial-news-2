Mersen , the Paris-based maker of
parts for electrical motors, won dismissal of some U.K. damages
claims in a four-year-old price-fixing lawsuit by customers
including Robert Bosch GmbH.  The European Commission’s 43 million euro ($61 million)
fine in 2003 against  Mersen (MRN) , then known as Carbone Lorraine SA,
didn’t blame the company’s U.K. subsidiary in a way that
established jurisdiction for customers to sue in U.K. courts,
the  Competition Appeal Tribunal  ruled today in London.  Robert Bosch sued four years ago together with St. Louis-
based  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  and  Valeo SA (FR) , France’s second-largest
car-parts maker, claiming they were overcharged during the
cartel. The other defendants include Morgan Crucible Co., Schunk
GmbH and  SGL Carbon SE (SGL) , which settled last month.  The customers sued after the European Union fined the
cartel members a total of 101 million euros for fixing prices on
graphite products from 1988 to 1999. While Morgan Crucible
received immunity from the fines because it was the first to
cooperate, its former Chief Executive Officer Ian Norris was
sentenced to 18 months in prison in a U.S. case over his role in
the cartel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
