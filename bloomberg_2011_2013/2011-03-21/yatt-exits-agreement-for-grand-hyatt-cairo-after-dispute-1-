  Hyatt Hotels Corp. (H)  will terminate
its management agreement for the Grand Hyatt Cairo hotel in  Egypt  because of unresolved contractual disputes with the
hotel’s owner.  “It is unfortunate that the contractual disputes have not
been resolved, forcing us to exit this property, but this does
not diminish how important Egypt is and will remain to the Hyatt
brand,” an e-mailed statement cited Gebhard Rainer, managing
director of the company’s regional unit.  “We will continue to operate two Hyatt hotels in Egypt,
and are interested in pursuing new development opportunities
there,” the statement cited Rainer as saying.  Hyatt notified the hotel’s owner, the Saudi Egyptian
Touristic Development Co., of its decision, it said. Hyatt began
managing Grand Hyatt Cairo in August 2003 and currently provides
management services for two Hyatt Regency hotels in the
Red Sea resorts of Sharm El Sheikh and Taba Heights, it said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
