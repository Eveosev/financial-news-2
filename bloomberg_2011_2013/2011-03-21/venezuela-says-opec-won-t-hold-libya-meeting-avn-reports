Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  dismissed holding a special meeting of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries to evaluate the situation in
Libya, which is a member of the group, according to  Agencia
Venezolana de Noticias .  “We can’t pretend to have stability in the oil market when
the big industrial powers introduce this kind of
destabilization,” Ramirez said, according to AVN.  Military strikes by the U.S., U.K. and France have halted
the advance of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s forces on rebel-
held territory in the east of Africa’s third-largest oil
producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
