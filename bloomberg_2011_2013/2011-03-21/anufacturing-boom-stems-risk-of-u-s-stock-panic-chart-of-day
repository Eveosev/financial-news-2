“U.S. manufacturing is booming”
and helps explain why stock investors shouldn’t panic over  Japan ’s nuclear disaster or the Middle East’s conflicts,
according to Edward Yardeni, president and chief investment
strategist at Yardeni Research Inc.  Growth has been “surprisingly robust” and may be
accelerating, Yardeni wrote today in a report. He cited the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s factory index for March,
which showed the fastest expansion since 1984. The indicator for
eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey  and Delaware climbed
to 43.4 from 35.9 in February.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Philadelphia Fed’s index
with the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index,
based on a nationwide survey of corporate purchasing managers,
since 2000.  In February, the ISM index rose to 61.4, matching its
highest level since 1983. Readings greater than 50 point to
expansion. The indicator has risen for seven straight months.  “It is becoming increasingly obvious” that U.S. factories
are taking part in a global manufacturing surge that includes
countries such as  Germany  and  South Korea , Yardeni wrote.  The growth is among a dozen reasons not to panic over
what’s happening in Japan and the Mideast, the report said.
Others include “super-normal” earnings growth, a rebound in
employment, a pickup in takeovers and “extremely stimulative”
fiscal and monetary policy.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
