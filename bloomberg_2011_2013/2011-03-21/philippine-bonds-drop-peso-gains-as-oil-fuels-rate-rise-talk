Philippine  government bonds  fell
and the peso gained on speculation higher oil costs will
convince the central bank to raise the nation’s benchmark
interest rate from a record low.  Six out of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will raise its overnight borrowing
rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25 percent on March
24. One predicts a half percentage point increase, while three
forecast no change. Crude oil for April delivery climbed 1.8
percent to $102.88 per barrel in  New York  as the U.S., U.K. and
France expanded attacks on  Libya .  “Given rising oil prices, the central bank might need to
tame inflation by raising  interest rates  sooner rather than
later,” said Speedy Delfino, a fixed-income trader at Bank of
Commerce in  Manila .  The yield on the 7 percent peso bond due January 2016 rose
11 basis points, 0.11 percentage point, to 6.00 percent as of
10:46 a.m. in Manila, data from Tradition Financial Services
showed. It was the biggest gain since Feb. 14. The peso advanced
0.3 percent to 43.57 per dollar, its second day of gains,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas hasn’t raised its benchmark
rate since August 2008. The central bank will consider the
impact of the crisis in  Japan  on the economy at its meeting this
week, Governor Amando Tetangco said March 18.  The Bureau of the Treasury will auction 8.5 billion pesos
($195 million) of bills due in three months to a year at 1 p.m.
today in Manila. Yields on the six-month and one-year notes will
probably decline because of demand, Delfino said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
