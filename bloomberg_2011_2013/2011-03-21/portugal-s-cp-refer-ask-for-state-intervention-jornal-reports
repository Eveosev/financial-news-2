Portuguese state-owned public
transport companies including rail service operator CP-Comboios
de  Portugal  and railway network manager Refer-Rede Ferroviaria
Nacional have asked for state intervention as they face problems
with financing, Jornal de Negocios reported, without saying how
it obtained the information.  The companies are asking the  Finance Ministry  to anticipate
compensation they receive through the budget as payment for the
public service that’s provided, the Portuguese newspaper said.
The possibility of Portugal’s Treasury providing loans to the
state-owned companies is also being studied, according to Jornal
de Negocios.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
