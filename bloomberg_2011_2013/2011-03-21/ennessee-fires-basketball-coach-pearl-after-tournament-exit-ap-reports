Bruce Pearl was fired as men’s
basketball coach at the  University of Tennessee  after completing
a season in which he was accused of unethical conduct for lying
to the sport’s governing body, the  Associated Press  reported,
citing a person with knowledge of the decision.  Telephone and e-mail messages left for Tom Satkowiak, a
spokesman for the Knoxville,  Tennessee , school, weren’t
immediately returned.  In September, Pearl admitted he gave the  National
Collegiate Athletic Association  misleading and incorrect
information about hosting football recruits during a cookout at
his home, AP reported. Tennessee’s basketball and football
programs have since been charged with a dozen violations, AP
said.  Pearl, 51, served an eight-game suspension, agreed to give
up $1.5 million in pay over the next four years and was working
without a contract when he was let go.  The Volunteers (19-15) lost to Michigan 75-45 on March 18
in the first round of the NCAA tournament, ending their season
with defeats in eight of their final 12 games. Pearl went 145-61
with the Volunteers in six seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
