German  tax revenue  jumped almost 10
percent in February, the  Finance Ministry  said, citing economic
crisis-related “weak” tax receipts a year earlier as the main
reason for magnitude of the gain.  Tax revenue rose 9.7 percent from a year earlier to 39.5
billion euros ($56 billion), the ministry said today in its
monthly report. The ministry expects to collect 1 percent more
tax in the year as a whole, compared with 2010.  “The economic upswing in Germany is continuing at a
moderate pace,” the Berlin-based ministry said. “The latest
sentiment indicators signal that economic activity in Germany
will gather steam again in the course of the year.”  German companies are boosting investment and hiring to meet
growing export orders, fueling domestic spending and putting the
economic recovery on a firmer footing. Available figures support
the government’s view that the economy,  Europe ’s biggest, will
grow 2.3 percent this year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
