  China ’s net imports of coal dropped
to the lowest in 23 months in February after prices increased
and demand fell during the Lunar New Year holiday, customs data
showed today.  Net purchases of the power-station fuel slumped 67 percent
to 5 million metric tons last month from January, according to
data released by the Beijing-based Administration of Customs.  Higher global coal prices hampered China’s imports of the
fuel. The weeklong Chinese Lunar New Year break also reduced
demand from the world’s largest energy user, said  David Fang ,
head of the international department at China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association.  “Coal purchased dropped significantly because of the
delayed effect of higher global prices,” Fang said by telephone
from Beijing today. “Domestic coal demand will stay weak in
coming months as the weather gets warmer and hydro-power
generation increases.”  China paid $114 a ton for the fuel last month, compared
with an average $102.70 last year. Coal imports from  Indonesia ,
China’s largest supplier of the fuel, fell 56 percent from a
year earlier to 2.48 million tons, at $83 a ton. Coal purchases
from  Australia , the second biggest, fell 54 percent to 1.52
million tons, at $169 a ton. That compares with $147 a ton in
2010 for the Australian varieties and $79 a ton for the
Indonesian fuel.  Chinese power plants’ inventories of coal fell to 53.9
million tons at the end of February, or enough for 16 days of
supply, the China Electricity Council said on March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
