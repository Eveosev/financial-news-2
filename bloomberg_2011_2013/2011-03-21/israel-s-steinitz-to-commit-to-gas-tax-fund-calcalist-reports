Israeli Finance Minister Yuval
Steinitz is expected to appear before Parliament’s finance
committee this week and give the government’s commitment to
creating a fund to manage gas-tax revenue, the financial daily
Calcalist said, without saying where it got the information.   The establishment of the fund was raised by a number of the
committee members as a condition for their support of the gas-
revenue tax law, the daily said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
