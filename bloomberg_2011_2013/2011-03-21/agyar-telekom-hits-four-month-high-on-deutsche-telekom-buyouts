Magyar Telekom Nyrt. jumped to its
highest level in four months after  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , its
majority owner, said it plans to buy back minority stakes.  Hungary’s former telephone monopoly rallied as much as 4.5
percent to 600 forint, its strongest intraday price since Nov.
18, and traded up 3.3 percent as of 2:30 p.m. in Budapest.  Deutsche Telekom rose as much as 16 percent today, the most
on record, after the company said it will sell its U.S. wireless
unit to AT&T Inc. for $39 billion. The German company said late
yesterday it will use the proceeds to slash debt and funnel
about 5 billion euros ($7.1 billion) into share buybacks.  “Interest in Magyar Telekom shares is probably driven by
speculation about higher chances for a minority buyout by
Deutsche Telekom after divestment in the U.S.,” Igor Muller, an
analyst at Prague-based brokerage Wood & Co., wrote in an e-
mail. “Consolidation of the European telecom market starts to
look more realistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
