  CEZ AS (CEZ)  jumped for a fifth day to
its highest in almost seven weeks after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said the biggest Czech utility may benefit from  Germany  shutting
down some nuclear power plants.  The stock jumped 1.2 percent to 839 koruna by 10:07 a.m. in
Prague, its highest intraday price since Feb. 2.  CEZ “can benefit from attractive opportunities in the
electricity and gas wholesale markets” as it is “exposed to
higher prices from German action without exposure to German
politics,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a report to clients
today.  Deutsche Bank raised its price estimate for CEZ shares to
1,040 koruna from 920 koruna in a report on March 18.
Electricity prices are likely to rise after explosions and a
radiation leak at a nuclear plant in  Japan  prompted neighboring
Germany to shut down some reactors for safety inspections,
according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
