  China ’s commercial crude-oil
stockpiles dropped in February compared with a month earlier
while diesel supplies surged for a third month as the country
replenishes inventories after fuel shortages earlier this year.  Crude supplies climbed 2 percent by the end of last month,
according to data from the official Xinhua News agency. Diesel
inventories gained 28 percent in the same period, Xinhua said in
an e-mail today. Kerosene and gasoline stockpiles both increased
by 1.2 percent.  Diesel supplies led gains as China’s refiners boosted
processing runs. Inventories climbed to about 11.6 million
metric tons for the month, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on the Xinhua data. Gasoline supplies rose to 7.04 million
tons while kerosene advanced to 1.7 million tons.  Crude-oil supplies increased to about 27.5 million tons,
according to the calculations. Xinhua hasn’t provided data on
absolute inventory levels since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
