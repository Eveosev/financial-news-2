Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  will travel to the Slovenian capital Ljubljana tomorrow to
oversee agreements on the South Stream gas pipeline project.  Two accords will be signed during Putin’s visit -- an
agreement to create a joint company for the engineering,
construction and maintenance of the Slovenian section of the
pipeline and a memorandum of understanding between Gazprom Neft
and Slovenia’s biggest energy group, Petrol Group d.d., said
Yury Ushakov, Putin’s deputy chief of staff.  Ushakov declined to say who the signatories to the joint
venture agreement will be or what the memorandum is about.  “These are important documents,” Ushakov said. “It will
be about practical participation of the Slovenians in
construction of their section of the pipeline.”  The South Stream project, led by Russian gas monopoly OAO
Gazprom and Italy’s  Eni SpA (ENI) , will create a pipeline delivering
Russian gas to southeastern  Europe .  To contact the reporters on this story:
