Global oil and gas demand will rise
and remain strong in the long run as countries reconsider use of
nuclear power, according to John Tomic,  Noble Energy  Inc.’s
manager in Cyprus.  Following the radiation leaks at the Fukushima Dai-Chi
nuclear plant in  Japan , “emphasis will be on other forms of
energy easy to transport, such as oil and gas,” the manager of
the Houston, Texas-based company said in an interview yesterday.  Economic growth in  China  and  India  will be important in
maintaining demand for oil and gas; the supply of oil, though
not that of natural gas, will decline as “we are not adding
reserves at the same rate we are depleting them,” Tomic said.  China halted nuclear-power projects after the earthquake in
Japan.  Noble Energy has a concession to explore for oil and gas in
an area off the southeast coast of Cyprus known as block 12.
Tomic said it plans to start drilling in October. Natural-gas
reserves in the block may amount to 10 trillion cubic feet,
according to Solon Kassinis, who heads Cyprus’s energy service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
