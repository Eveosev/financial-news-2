Home run record holder  Barry Bonds ’s trial to determine if he committed perjury when he said
he never knowingly took steroids began today with jury selection
in federal court in San Francisco.  Bonds, 46, who broke  Hank Aaron ’s record of 755 career home
runs in August 2007, faces four counts of perjury and one count
of obstruction of justice for telling a grand jury in 2003 that
he didn’t knowingly take steroids. The maximum sentence for each
of the counts is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Bonds,
who was first charged in November 2007, has pleaded not guilty.  The trial was postponed for two years as federal
prosecutors appealed a judge’s ruling barring them from using as
evidence certain documents they say show that Bonds tested
positive for steroid use. They lost the appeal. Government
attorneys may call former New York Yankee Jason Giambi and other
baseball players to testify that they received steroids from
Bonds’s former trainer, according to court documents.  Bonds  holds the Major League Baseball career record with
762 home runs and the single-season record with 73 home runs in
2001. He played 22 seasons in the major leagues, the first seven
with the Pittsburgh Pirates before moving to the  San Francisco 
Giants in 1993 as a free agent. He won a record seven National
League Most Valuable Player awards, including four straight from
2001 through 2004. He hasn’t played since the 2007 season.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
