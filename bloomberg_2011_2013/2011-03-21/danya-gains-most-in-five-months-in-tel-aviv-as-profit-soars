  Danya Cebus Ltd. (DNYA) , the construction
unit of  Africa-Israel Investments Ltd. (AFIL) , rose the most in more
than five months after reporting a surge in 2010 profit.  The shares jumped 10 percent, the biggest intraday gain
since Oct. 3, to 18.28 shekels at 1:09 p.m. in Tel Aviv. That
gave the Or-Yehuda-based company a market value of 519 million
shekels ($147 million).  Danyaâ€™s net income soared to 91.3 million shekels from 1.9
million shekels in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
