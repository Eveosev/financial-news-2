  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) ’s Sabine Pass
liquefied-natural-gas terminal in Louisiana received a cargo of
the fuel yesterday, according to vessel tracking data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The tanker, Al Gharrafa, can carry as much as 216,200 cubic
meters of LNG, or about 4.66 billion cubic feet of natural gas,
equivalent to 7.5 percent of estimated daily U.S. gas
production. The cargo is from Qatar, the data showed.  Another ship, Bluesky, is anchored off the  Gulf Coast  near
Sabine Pass, according to the vessel tracking data.  Charif Souki, Cheniere’s chief executive officer, said on
March 16 that the Sabine Pass terminal doesn’t have LNG
inventory for re-export.    Japan  is increasing LNG imports to generate electricity
after the March 11 earthquake and resulting tsunami damaged
nuclear reactors.  LNG is gas that’s cooled to a liquid for transport by ship
to markets not connected by pipelines. The fuel is received at
import terminals and converted back to a gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
