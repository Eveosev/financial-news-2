GT Solar International Inc. (SOLR) , a maker
of polysilicon manufacturing equipment, neared an almost three-
year high after winning a $228 million order, its largest to
date.  GT Solar surged as much as $1.03, or 9 percent, to $12.51
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The Merrimack, New Hampshire-
based company rose 87 cents, or 7.6 percent, to $12.35 at 1:34
p.m., its highest since Sept. 19, 2008.  GT’s contract with South Korea-based polysilicon producer
OCI Co. is at least its eighth since the beginning of 2011. It
has received orders worth $406.2 million for polysilicon
equipment, $384.8 million for sapphire furnaces and $37.5
million for silicon ingot production systems.  “GT Solar has been our top pick since the beginning of the
year,” Ahmar Zaman, an analyst at Piper Jaffray & Co., said
today in an interview. “We’ve been expecting this after their
order in December.”  OCI placed another order with GT Solar in December, worth
$47.3 million, after announcing plans to invest 1.9 trillion won
($1.7 billion) to expand its annual polysilicon production
capacity to 62,000 metric tons. Polysilicon is the main raw
material in solar cells.  “We see very strong growth in GT in the next 12 to 18
months,” said Zaman, who today reiterated his “overweight”
recommendation and $16 target price on the company.  Of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, 12 had buy ratings, 3
had holds and there were no sell ratings on GT Solar.  ‘Strong’ Business  “Their business is great right now and their silicon and
sapphire businesses look really strong,” said Weston Twigg, an
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities in  Portland ,  Oregon , who
yesterday reiterated his “outperform” recommendation and a $17
target price on GT Solar.  GT Solar also produces furnaces to produce synthetic
sapphires, which are used in energy-efficient light-emitting
diodes, and equipment to make polysilicon ingots.  Twigg said the varied product lines can help GT Solar
maintain revenue if an anticipated oversupply in solar panels
this year reduces demand for equipment used to make them. “The
three legs actually give them a lot more flexibility to weather
cycles.”  The OCI order will be included in the backlog for GT
Solar’s current quarter, which ends on July 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
