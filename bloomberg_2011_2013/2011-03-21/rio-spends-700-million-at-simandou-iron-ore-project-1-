Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-largest mining company, said it has spent $700 million to
date at the Simandou iron ore project in  Guinea .  “Our current plans for the mine, railway and port calls
for the creation of tens of thousands of jobs during the
construction phase and more than 4,000 full-time jobs once
operational,” Tom Albanese, chief executive of the London-based
company, also said today in e-mailed comments.  Rio is studying spending at least $6 billion in Guinea,
where new President Alpha Conde has ordered a drafting policy
giving the country at least a one-third stake in mining projects.
The company said in July it had invested $650 million at
Simandou and planned to begin mining within five years.  Rio is “very pleased” with the contribution that Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. has made to the project, Albanese said. Rio
has agreed to sell Chinalco, as the state-owned company is known,
a 44.65 percent stake in Simandou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
