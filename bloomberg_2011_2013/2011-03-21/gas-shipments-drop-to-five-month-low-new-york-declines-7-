delivery to U.S. households dropped to the lowest level in

day, down 5.2 percent to 28.3 million dekatherms (27.6 billion
cubic feet), the lowest level since Oct. 30, based on a sampling

a.m. in New York.  About 2.56 million dekatherms were to be delivered to New

and South through March 25, according to MDA Federal Inc.’s
