The U.S. East Coast and South will
be warmer than normal from April to June, according to the
Weather Channel’s  WSI  weather services company.  Weather in the U.S. Northwest and upper Great Plains states
will average cooler than normal, said WSI, based in Andover,
 Massachusetts .  “As we head into spring, the La Nina event is still the
primary driver of the Northern Hemispheric pattern, even through
the magnitude of the event is diminishing,” said  Todd Crawford ,
WSI’s chief meteorologist.  La Nina is a cooling of the Pacific Ocean that influences
weather patterns in the U.S. by making the South drier than
normal and by enhancing hurricane formation in the Atlantic.  “Cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, mid-
Atlantic and Great Lakes regions in May should provide for soft
electrical demand as the summer approaches,” according to  Chris Kostas , senior power and gas analyst at  Energy Security Analysis
Inc.,  which contributes to WSI’s report.  In June, the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states are forecast
to warm, and that is likely to drive electricity demand up in
those regions, Kostas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
