Vietnamese bonds fell on
speculation quickening inflation will lead to higher  interest
rates . The dong declined for a second day.  Consumer prices may increase 2.2 percent this month from
February and gains in the first quarter are expected to be about
6 percent, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung said in an
address to lawmakers at the National Assembly today. They jumped
12.3 percent from a year earlier last month, the most in two
years, official figures show.  “I agree with some foreign investors’ opinion that
monetary policy hasn’t been tightened enough, so I expect there
will be further tightening, especially after inflation
accelerates in March from last month,” said Dam Trung Kien, a
Hanoi-based trader at Bao Viet Fund Management Co., a unit of  Vietnam ’s biggest insurer. “That will boost interest rates and
bond yields.”  The yield on five-year bonds rose four basis points to
11.92 percent as of 2:45 p.m. in Hanoi, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The State Treasury sold only 30 billion dong ($1.4 million)
of 10-year securities on March 17 when it offered 1 trillion
dong each of three-, five- and 10-year bonds, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange. Investors demanded rates from 12.5 percent
to 13 percent for the five-year notes, while the ceiling rate
was 11.4 percent, according to a statement on the exchange’s
website.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,878 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,673, compared with 20,663 on March 18,
