Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  climbed 24.78 points, or 0.7
percent, to 3,518.85, rising for a second day.  Banks: PT Bank Central Asia (BBCA IJ),  Indonesia ’s largest
bank by market value, rose 2.3 percent to 6,700 rupiah. PT Bank
Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI IJ), the second-biggest by assets, gained
2 percent to 5,100 rupiah. Financial stocks provided the biggest
boost to the composite index today.    Bank Indonesia  “isn’t worried” about inflation in March,
April and May, Governor Darmin Nasution said today. Easing
inflation widens the scope for the central bank to keep
borrowing costs unchanged.  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ), Indonesia’s second-largest coal
producer, fell 2.1 percent to 2,325 rupiah after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. cut the stock to “sell” from “neutral” on March
18, citing an increase in cash production costs.  PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF IJ), which owns Indonesia’s
biggest instant-noodle maker, gained 2.1 percent to 4,950
rupiah. The company’s 2010 net income increased to 2.95 trillion
rupiah ($336 million) from 2.07 trillion rupiah a year earlier,
it said in a statement in  Bisnis Indonesia . That compares with a
mean estimate of 2.82 trillion rupiah among 19 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ), the nation’s largest
airline, fell 1.8 percent to 540 rupiah. Crude oil futures
gained as much as 2.3 percent to $103.35 a barrel in after-hours
trading in  New York . A higher oil price may increase the
airline’s fuel costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
