Two babies were taken from a pair
of French citizens as they tried to illegally remove them from
Ukraine, the former Soviet state’s customs office said.  Officers at the country’s western border found the two,
two-month-old girls in a trunk near a sofa in the back of a
utility vehicle, the customs office said today in an e-mailed
statement. The infants were in “an inappropriate condition”
and were hospitalized, according to the statement.  It didn’t say whether the French citizens were detained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
