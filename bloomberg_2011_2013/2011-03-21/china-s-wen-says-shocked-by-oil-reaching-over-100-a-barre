Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said he
was “surprised and shocked” that the price of oil had exceeded
$100 a barrel.  “I feel somewhat concerned about the oil price,” Wen said
today in Beijing at a meeting with visiting business executives
including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser. “I am very surprised and shocked when I saw the
international price of oil has exceeded $100 a barrel.”  Oil prices in  New York  and London climbed today as allied
air strikes in Libya threatened to prolong a supply disruption
in Africa’s third-biggest producer. Crude oil in London gained
as much as 2 percent to $116.22 a barrel today.    China  needs to improve its system of pricing oil, which has
to be “consistent with international practice,” Wen said.  China may adjust fuel prices when crude costs change by
more than 4 percent over 22 working days based on a mechanism
introduced in December 2008. The country, the world’s largest
energy user, imports more than half of its crude oil as domestic
production growth lags behind demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
