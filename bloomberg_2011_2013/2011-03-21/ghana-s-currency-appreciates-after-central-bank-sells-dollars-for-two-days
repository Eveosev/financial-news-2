  Ghana ’s currency, the cedi,
strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  after the country’s central
bank sold the greenback on Thursday and Friday.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
traded at 1.5315 per dollar by 1:57 p.m. in Accra, from 1.5320
on Friday, according to data from Barclays Plc’s Ghana unit.  The move by the Bank of Ghana to sell dollars “did have a
bit of an effect” as the currency traded as low as 1.5340 on
Friday, said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader with the lender’s
Accra office. No one was available to comment at the central
bank’s treasury department, according to a woman who answered
the phone and did not identify herself.  To contact the reporter on this story:
