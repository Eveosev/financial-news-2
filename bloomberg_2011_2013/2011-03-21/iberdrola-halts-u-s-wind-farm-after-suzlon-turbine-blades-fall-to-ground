  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , the biggest producer
of renewable energy, halted power production at a 150-megawatt
wind farm in Rugby,  North Dakota , after the blades of a  Suzlon
Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  S88 generator fell from their mount.  The plant was suspended after the March 14 accident while
Spain’s Iberdrola and Suzlon of India investigate the causes,
according to an Iberdrola spokesman who asked not to be named in
line with company policy. No one was hurt and there is no
indication of when electricity production may resume.  Suzlon has signed contracts to deliver at least 1,257
megawatts of the 2.1-megawatt turbines to countries including
China, Australia, India and Brazil, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. The same model suffered cracked blades in 2008,
prompting Suzlon to strengthen the components at a cost of $25
million, according to the  Composites World  industry website.  “In partnership with our customer Iberdrola Renewables,
Suzlon is currently conducting an investigation into the cause
of this incident,” Suzlon said in an e-mailed response to
questions about the plant, owned by the renewable-energy unit of
Bilbao-based Iberdrola.  To contact the reporters on this story:
