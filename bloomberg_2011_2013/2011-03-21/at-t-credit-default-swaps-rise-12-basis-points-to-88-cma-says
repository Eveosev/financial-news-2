The cost of insuring debt of  AT&T
Inc. (T)  rose to the highest since Sept. 1 after it agreed to buy T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG for about $39 billion in
cash and stock to create the largest U.S. mobile-phone company.  Credit-default swaps linked to AT&T’s debt rose 11.6 basis
points to 87.4 as of 8:45 a.m. in  New York , according to CMA
prices. A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting $10
million of debt from default for five years is equivalent to
$1,000 a year.  AT&T said yesterday the cash part of the purchase price
will be financed from the holdings on AT&T’s balance sheet and
new debt. AT&T has an 18-month commitment for a $20 billion
unsecured one-year bridge loan from JPMorgan Chase & Co., the
Dallas-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
