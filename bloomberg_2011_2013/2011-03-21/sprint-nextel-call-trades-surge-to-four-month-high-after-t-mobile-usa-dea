Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  call volume
surged to a four-month high as the third-biggest U.S. wireless
provider plunged the most since March 2009 after  AT&T Inc. (T) 
agreed to buy  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s U.S. wireless unit.  Almost 204,000 calls to buy the provider changed hands
today, more than six times the four-week average and almost four
times the number of puts to sell. The May $5.50 calls were the
most traded and accounted for more than a fifth of call volume.
 Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint tumbled 14 percent to $4.36.  AT&T yesterday agreed to buy  T-Mobile USA  for $39 billion
in cash and stock to create America’s largest mobile-phone
company. The deal would allow AT&T, now the second-largest U.S.
wireless operator, to add about 34 million customers and surpass
 Verizon Wireless . Sprint had held talks with Deutsche Telekom
about acquiring T-Mobile, people familiar with the matter said.  An investor bought a block of 30,000 Sprint May $5.50 calls
for 8 cents each at 10:22 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and a report by Trade Alert LLC, a New
York-based provider of options-market analytics. Those options
fell 55 percent to 9 cents each, Bloomberg data show. A block of
28,700 August $5.50 calls traded at 3:35 p.m. for 17 cents
apiece, 100 percent at the ask price. The open interest for the
August $5.50 calls was 3,262 before today, while the open
interest for the May $5.50 calls was 12,878 before today.  Sprint’s implied volatility, the key gauge of option
prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days jumped to
47.95 from 44.12 on March 18.  Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
