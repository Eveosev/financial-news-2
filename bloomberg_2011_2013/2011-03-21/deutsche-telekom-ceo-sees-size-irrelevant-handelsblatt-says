Deutsche Telekom AG’s slippage to
third-biggest from the biggest European-based telecoms operator
as a result of the agreed sale of its T-Mobile USA unit to AT&T
Inc. is “irrelevant,”  Handelsblatt  cited Chief Executive
Officer Rene Obermann as saying.  The sale created “enormous additional value,” the
newspaper quoted Obermann as saying in a preview of an interview
to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
