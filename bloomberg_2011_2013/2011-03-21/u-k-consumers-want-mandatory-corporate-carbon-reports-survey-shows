Seven in 10 U.K. consumers polled
say businesses should be required to report  carbon emissions , a
survey commissioned by the government-funded Carbon Trust found.  Ninety percent of those surveyed said companies should
commit to reducing heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions by 3
percent a year, 70 percent said carbon reporting should be
mandatory and 56 percent said they’re more concerned than five
years ago about business actions to combat climate change,
according to the poll e-mailed today by the low-carbon advocate.  Only 7 percent said they believed companies that said they
have taken action to fight global warming, according to the
study. The phone poll of 1,000 U.K. adults was conducted by  WPP
PLC (WPP) ’s BrandZ analyst, which estimates 2 percent of sales of a
brand are attributable to its environmental reputation. No
margin of error was provided for the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
