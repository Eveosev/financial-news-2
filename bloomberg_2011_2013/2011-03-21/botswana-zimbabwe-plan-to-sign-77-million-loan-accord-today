Botswana is scheduled to sign an
accord today that will pave the way for a 500 million pula ($76
million) line of credit for neighboring  Zimbabwe , a Botswana
business group said.  Under the accord, Botswana’s state-owned export credit
agency will guarantee trade finance for local and Zimbabwean
companies, the Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry and
Manpower said. Trade and Industry Minister Dorcus Makgato-Malesu
went to Zimbabwe yesterday to sign the agreement.  The accord is a “precondition” for the start of the  credit
line , the confederation said today in an e-mailed statement.  Botswana decided to extend the credit to Zimbabwe after
President Robert Mugabe and  Morgan Tsvangirai , leader of the
Movement for Democratic Change, agreed to set up a coalition
government following disputed elections in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
