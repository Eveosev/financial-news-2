A group of Colorado homeowners said  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  affiliates participated in a
development of single-family homes in Glenwood Springs that were
allegedly damaged by construction defects. The group, which
wants to review Lehmanâ€™s insurance policies with a view to
getting compensation, said it is seeking to add Lehman as a
defendant to a case in Colorado State Court, according to a May
18 bankruptcy court filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
