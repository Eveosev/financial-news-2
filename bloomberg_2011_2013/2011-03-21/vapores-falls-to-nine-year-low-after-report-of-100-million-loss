Cia. Sudamericana de Vapores SA
fell to the lowest price in almost nine years after an executive
told Chilean newspaper  El Mercurio  that the company is running
at a loss amid higher  oil prices  and lower transport rates.  Latin Americaâ€™s largest container shipper slid 4.6 percent
to 241.1 pesos at 9:02 a.m. New York time and earlier plunged to
235 pesos, the lowest intraday price since August 2002.  Vapores may post a loss of about $100 million in the first
quarter, Deputy Chairman Arturo Claro said in an interview with
the Santiago-based newspaper. Cash flow problems could occur if
the situation continues for six months, El Mercurio quoted him
as saying.  Vapores plans to sell $500 million of new shares as well as
a stake in port operator SAAM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
