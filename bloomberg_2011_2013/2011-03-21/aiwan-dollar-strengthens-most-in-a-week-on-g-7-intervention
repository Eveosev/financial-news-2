  Taiwan ’s dollar gained, snapping a
two-day drop, on speculation intervention by the Group of Seven
nations to curb the yen’s rally will stabilize the market and
boost demand for emerging-market currencies.  The currency advanced the most in a week after G-7 nations
followed Japan’s lead and sold the currency after it reached a
postwar high on March 17. The Obama administration believes the
worst of Japan’s nuclear crisis is over, U.S. Energy Secretary
Steven Chu said.  “The efforts made by the G-7 countries have stabilized  market sentiment ,” said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-
exchange trader at Taiwan Shin Kong Commercial Bank. “The
nuclear risk in Japan has eased for the time being. That
supports risk-taking sentiment.”  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.1 percent, the most since
March 14, to NT$29.572 against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4
p.m. local time close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.    Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the
1.375 percent note due March 2021, the most-traded government
debt, was 1.342 percent, compared with 1.339 percent on March 18,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  The rate dropped six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point,
last week, the biggest weekly decline for a benchmark 10-year
bond since March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
