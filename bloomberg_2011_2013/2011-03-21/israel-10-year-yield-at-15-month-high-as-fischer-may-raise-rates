Yields on Israeli 10-year  government bonds  rose to the highest level in 15 months as  Japan ’s atomic crisis eased and expectations of higher interest
rates reduced demand for safer assets.  U.S. Treasuries fell for a third day, the longest losing
streak in six weeks, after Japan’s Prime Minister Naoto Kan said
he can see “light at the end of the tunnel” as progress is
being made in restoring power to reactors at the earthquake-
damaged Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Strategists including  Jim Caron  at Morgan Stanley & Co. said Japan’s biggest
earthquake on record and unrest in the Middle East and North
Africa won’t derail the global economic expansion.  “There is more optimism in the market today that the
central bank will be able to raise interest rates next week on
signs of improved global growth,”  Rafael Gozlan , chief
economist at Leader Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by
telephone.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 increased three basis points to 5.25 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the highest since December 2009. The
shekel, which has strengthened 6 percent over the past year, was
little changed at 3.5321 per dollar as of 4:45 p.m.  Israeli annual inflation in February quickened to 4.2
percent, the fastest pace in more than two years, from 3.6
percent in January, the Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of
Statistics said March 15. That exceeded the 3.9 percent median
forecast of 12 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank of Israel Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised the
benchmark interest rate for a second month on Feb. 21, bringing
it to 2.5 percent. The central bank next meets on March 28. Five
of 16 economists in a survey taken before last week’s inflation
report expected a quarter-point increase. The remaining 11 had
expected the rate to stay unchanged at 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
