European Central Bank council
member  Yves Mersch  said “strong vigilance” is needed to
prevent upside risks to the inflation outlook from
materializing, indicating he supports raising  interest rates 
next month.  “The present accommodative monetary policy gives
considerable support to the economy,” Mersch wrote in a
quarterly report published today by the Luxembourg Central Bank,
which he heads. “It’s essential that the recent rise in
inflation doesn’t lead to a general inflationary trend in the
medium term. Strong vigilance is needed to contain upside risks
to  price stability .” The ECB uses the term “strong vigilance”
to indicate a rate increase is imminent.  Euro-area inflation accelerated to 2.4 percent last month
and has been above the ECB’s 2 percent limit since December. ECB
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  earlier this month said policy
makers may raise the benchmark rate from a record low of 1
percent when they convene in April. On March 18, he said he
didn’t want to change that message, even as the aftermath of the
earthquake and tsunami in Japan threatens to hurt confidence and
economic growth.  “Recent economic data confirm that economic activity in
the euro area remains positive despite the existence of strong
uncertainty,” Mersch wrote in the report. The ECB “stands
ready to act in a resolute manner and at the appropriate time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
