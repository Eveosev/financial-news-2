  Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (GBLB) , the
Belgian investment firm controlled by billionaires  Albert Frere 
and Paul Desmarais, will take over  Pargesa Holding SA (PARG) ’s stake in  Imerys SA (NK)  to eliminate debt at the level of its Swiss parent.  GBL, which is 50 percent owned by Geneva-based Pargesa,
will pay 56.20 euros ($79.95) a share for the 25.6 percent stake
to raise its holding in Paris-based Imerys, the world’s biggest
producer of minerals used to add colors to paint, to 56.4
percent, the Brussels-based company said today in a statement.
Frere and Desmarais jointly control Pargesa via Parjointco NV.  GBL doesn’t plan to buy out minority investors and will ask
French market regulator AMF for an exemption from takeover
rules.  The transaction transfers 1.09 billion euros of cash from
GBL to Pargesa and allows the Swiss parent of GBL to eliminate
its net debt, which amounted to 1.43 billion Swiss francs ($1.58
billion) on Feb. 25. GBL’s cash, including assets held for
trading and own stock, minus debt amounted to 481 million euros
on Feb. 25 and the investment firm said March 3 it extended the
expiration of half of its 1.8 billion euros of credit lines
until 2016.  “This repositioning within the group provides Pargesa with
greater flexibility in its cash management,” the Geneva-based
parent of GBL said in a  separate statement  today. “This
reclassification does not imply any change at the level of
Imerys, neither in its strategy, nor in its listing, which will
remain active.”  GBL said the transaction will result in an accounting gain
of about 500 million euros. The transfer will not generate any
gain or loss in Pargesa’s accounts, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
