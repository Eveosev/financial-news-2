Starr International Co., a firm run
by former American International Group Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, sued  China MediaExpress
Holdings Inc. (CCME)  and its auditor Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, saying
it was fraudulently induced into investing about $13.5 million.  The suit from Starr Investments Cayman II Inc., filed in
 U.S. federal court  in Delaware on March 18, says Hong Kong-based
 China  MediaExpress misrepresented its business and finances.
Chief Executive Officer Zheng Cheng and Chief Financial Officer
Jacky Lam were also named in the suit. Lam quit this month.  Greenberg, through Starr International and C.V. Starr &
Co., is the third-largest China MediaExpress holder with 4.55
million shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Starr
International purchased about 1.5 million shares in October,
then valued at about $13.5 million. Shares of China
MediaExpress, which says it provides advertising on buses in
China, have been halted in the U.S. since March 11 after
plunging 48 percent in six weeks. The company said March 14 that
 Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  resigned.  China MediaExpress is one of about 370 Chinese companies
that obtained U.S. listings since 2004 without the rigors of
initial public offerings.  Starr also started arbitration proceedings in  Hong Kong 
against China MediaExpress on March 17, according to the
complaint. “Even if CCME should prove not to be a fraud,
plaintiff purchased CCME’s securities at artificially inflated
prices and was damaged thereby,” the document said, referring
to China MediaExpress by its stock symbol.  China MediaExpress didn’t respond to an e-mail message sent
to its investor relations department outside regular business
hours in Hong Kong. Jake Sokol, a C.V. Starr spokesman, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
