Popular uprisings in the Middle
East and North  Africa  that ousted the Egyptian and Tunisian
presidents are unlikely to spread south of the Sahara, according
to  Standard & Poor’s .  Much of sub-Saharan Africa enjoys better civil rights and
press freedoms than people in the Middle East and North Africa,
while lacking the ethnic or religious cohesion to spark a
revolution, the credit agency said today in an e-mailed
statement, citing analyst Ravi Bhatia. Still, the regions share
concerns about high unemployment, authoritarian governments and
rapid population growth, it said.  “Although we underscore that this view does not imply that
political tensions and violence will not occur in sub-Saharan
Africa, we view the likelihood of a simultaneous, concerted and
contagious pan-African uprising at this moment in time as low,”
Bhatia said, according to the statement.  Popular revolts that toppled Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and Egyptian leader  Hosni Mubarak  this year have
spread across the region to Libya, Bahrain, Algeria, Morocco,
Oman,  Saudi Arabia  and Yemen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
