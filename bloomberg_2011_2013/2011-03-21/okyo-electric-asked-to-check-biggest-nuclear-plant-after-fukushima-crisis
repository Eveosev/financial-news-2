Tokyo Electric Power Co. will
review the safety of its biggest nuclear power plant at the
request of local government after a March 11 earthquake and
tsunami crippled operations at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi station.  Niigata prefecture and the Kashiwazaki municipality asked
Tokyo Electric to do checks on its Kashiwazaki Kariwa plant,
the utility said today in a statement on its  website .  “We take this request seriously, and we shall promptly
begin work for examining the measures needed for a thorough
response,” the statement said.  The Kashiwazaki plant stopped operations for about two
years after 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck in 2007. That
temblor buckled walls and caused a fire at a transformer. About
1.5 liters (half a gallon) of radioactive water escaped from the
plant into the sea through drains because sealing plugs hadn’t
been installed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
