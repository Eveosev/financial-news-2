  Centrica Plc (CNA) ’s Direct Energy unit
agreed to buy New York-based Gateway Energy Services Corp. for
$90 million as the U.K.’s biggest energy supplier seeks to add
customers in the U.S.  The purchase will add more than 275,000 gas and electricity
customer accounts to Direct Energy, Windsor, England-based
Centrica said today in a statement. This will boost the number
of business and residential customers in the U.S. northeast to
about 800,000, Centrica said.  Centrica said it now has the largest deregulated retail
customer base in North America after expanding through
acquisitions since first entering the continent a decade ago
with the purchase of  Direct Energy Marketing . Retailers act as
middlemen in deregulated markets, buying electricity and gas
from the source and selling it to homes and businesses.  The British utility plans to double profit from  North
America  by 2014, by acquiring power plants and retail
operations,  Chris Weston , president of Direct Energy, said in an
interview in January.  Centrica fell 0.7 pence, or 0.2 percent, to 327.8 pence as
of the 4:30 p.m. close in London. The stock has risen 13 percent
in the past 12 months, valuing the company at 17 billion pounds
($27.7 billion).  Other major North American energy retailers include units
of Baltimore-based Constellation Energy Group Inc. and
Princeton, New Jersey-based NRG Energy Inc. Chairman Gary Bondi
co-founded closely held Gateway in 1997, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story: Zachary R. Mider in New
