  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  sold its
3.88 percent stake in Bank of Moscow to Russian billionaire  Suleiman Kerimov , Vedomosti reported, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the matter.   Goldman agreed to sell the stake for 7.1 billion rubles
($250 million) after Chief Executive Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  met
with Kerimov in Moscow last week, the newspaper said today. Both
men are on a Kremlin advisory board on turning Moscow into a
global financial center.   Kerimov plans to swap his shares in Bank of Moscow for
stock in VTB Group, which is acquiring the lender, Vedomosti
said. Kerimov currently holds 1.5 percent of VTB.   To contact the reporter on this story:
