  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , the world’s biggest
maker of mobile phones, has started supplying mobile banking
services for a Union Bank of  India  offering aimed at phone
customers who don’t have bank accounts.  The Union Bank Money Powered by Nokia service is available
in Gurgaon and will be released nationwide over the next few
months, the Mumbai-based bank said in a  statement.   Nokia, based in Espoo,  Finland , already sells mobile
banking in India, working with Mumbai-based Yes Bank. Like the
Union Bank service, the Yes Bank offering integrates small
retailers that sell Nokia phones into bank networks so customers
can deposit cash there and then pay bills and transfer money
using their handsets.  “The aim is to have an open ecosystem, so UBI and Yes Bank
customers will be able to send money to each other using the
respective services,” Mark Durrant, a spokesman for Nokia, said
by e-mail.  Both services are part of the Nokia Money initiative, based
on an offering from  Redwood City , California-based Obopay Inc.,
a mobile money service provider partly owned by Nokia.  An estimated 90 percent of Indian villages do not have a
bank branch, and more than 50 percent of Indians do not have
access to bank accounts, according to UBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
