  Madagascar Oil SA (MOIL)  is to freeze its
contracts as it prepares for international arbitration on the
Madagascar government’s planned expropriation of four
concessions, the Financial Times reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter.  Company executives say privately that they see little
chance of changing the government’s course, the newspaper said.  The company intends to freeze its contractual obligations
by means of a declaration of force majeure, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
