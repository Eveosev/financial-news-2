Qatar’s Hassad Food, a unit of the
country’s sovereign wealth fund, plans to purchase farmland in  Turkey  to grow crops and raise livestock, the company’s chairman
said.  Hassad is in negotiations with the Turkish government over
the farmland, Nasser Mohamed al Hajri said at a meeting in Doha,
Qatar, late yesterday.  The company invested $500 million in 2010, al Hajri said,
adding that Hassad has $350 million invested in farming ventures
in  Australia .  Qatar, an arid Persian Gulf emirate holding the world’s
third-largest natural gas reserves, is investing in agricultural
land and ventures abroad to secure food supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
