Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , the unit of the
casino company founded by billionaire Steve Wynn, said profit
last year more than doubled after opening a second resort in
the world’s biggest gambling hub.  Net income jumped to HK$4.42 billion ($567 million), or 85
cents per share, from HK$2.07 billion, or 41 cents, a year
earlier,  Wynn Macau  said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange yesterday. That beat the HK$4.07 billion average of 13
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Casino sales increased
60 percent to HK$21.1 billion.  The company opened  Encore Macau  in April, its second
location in the only place in  China  where casinos are legal and
where overall gambling revenue  surged  58 percent last year.
Wynn hopes to begin groundwork on its planned third Macau
resort in the Cotai area as early as this month, founder and
Chief Executive Officer  Steve Wynn  said in February.  Macau’s casino gambling revenue  increased 38 percent to
18.7 billion patacas ($2.3 billion) in the first 13 days of
this month, CLSA Ltd. analysts led by Aaron Fischer estimated
in a note to clients yesterday. Casino sales in the former
Portuguese colony  rose  48 percent to 19.9 billion patacas last
month and increased 33 percent to 18.6 billion patacas in
January, according to government data.  Wynn Macau has doubled in market value over the past year
and rose 2.6 percent to HK$21.70 yesterday, before the earnings
were released. Controlling shareholder  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN) 
advanced 4.6 to $121.76 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Both companies reported fourth-quarter profit last month.
Wynn Resorts posted a better-than-expected net income for the
period of $114.2 million and the Macau unit said profit more
than doubled to $208.8 million in the three months ended
December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
