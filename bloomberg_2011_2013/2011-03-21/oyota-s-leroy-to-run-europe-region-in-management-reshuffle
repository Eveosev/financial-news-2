  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s European
division said it’s reshuffling its top executives as part of the
parent company’s shift to a regional management structure.  Didier Leroy, president of Toyota Motor Europe, will also
be Toyota’s chief regional officer for Europe starting April 1,
the company’s Brussels-based division said today in an e-mailed
statement. Leroy will also coordinate regional operations
including financial services and the company’s design studio in
Sophia Antipolis,  France .  Toyota’s European sales fell 3.1 percent to 43,018 cars in
February from a year earlier, the  European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association  said March 16. Its share of the
region’s market fell to 4.2 percent from 4.4 percent, the
association said.  As part of the changed structure for  Europe , Executive Vice
President Hiroyuki Ochiai will oversee manufacturing functions
and operations, and Masahisa Nagata, previously a general
manager at the Tokyo-based engineering division, will oversee
European research and development and purchasing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
