China, India and  Brazil  pledged to
limit their greenhouse gas emissions in documents submitted to
the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change ,
formalizing commitments made in Copenhagen in December 2009.  China said it will try to lower carbon-dioxide emissions
per dollar of economic output at least 40 percent by 2020 from
2005 levels, according to a  document  dated March 18 and e-mailed
today by the UN body, which stewards global climate treaty
talks. India said it aims to cut emissions per dollar at least
20 percent in the same period while Brazil said it’ll slash
heat-trapping gases more than a third from projected 2020
levels.  The pledges were among those made by 48 nations included in
a non-binding document that forms part of agreements reached in
Cancun,  Mexico , last December. Climate negotiators at the time
said emissions goals would be documented while not publishing
the actual numbers.  While the commitments are not legally enforceable, they
formalize promises made in the Copenhagen Accord, an agreement
reached in the Danish capital in 2009 that was rejected as a
formal UN document because countries including Bolivia, Sudan
and Tuvalu didn’t accept it.  In a second  document , dated March 10, the UN compiled
emissions reductions goals for the 27-country European Union and
15 developed nations, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and
Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
