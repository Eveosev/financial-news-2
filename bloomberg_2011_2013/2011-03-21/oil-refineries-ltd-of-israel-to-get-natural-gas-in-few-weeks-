  Oil Refineries Ltd. (ORL) ,  Israel ’s
largest refiner, expects to receive supplies of natural gas to
be used as fuel at its refinery in Haifa in the “next few
weeks” when regulatory checks on a pipeline are completed.  “We expect the natural gas to be introduced in the next
few weeks,” Chief Executive Officer Yashar Ben-Mordechai said
today on a conference call. “The pipeline is complete. It’s
going through a procedure of checks by the government.”  The company’s plan to cut fuel oil consumption at the site
in favor of natural gas is aimed at cutting  carbon emissions 
blamed for global warming. The refiner expected to make the
switch by the end of 2010, it said in August.  Once the company starts burning the gas in furnaces, it
will be “fully compliant with the environmental regulations,”
Ben-Mordechai said. Burning low sulfur fuel oil in furnaces
instead of natural gas is more polluting and expensive.  The Haifa refinery has the capacity to process 197,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The CEO expects a utilization rate of 95 percent in 2011.  A new hydrocracker being built on site is “on schedule and
on budget,” Ben-Mordechai said. Two reactors arrived from  Italy 
this month and have been installed, he said. The 25,000 barrel-
a-day unit, being built at a cost of $500 million, is expected
to start operations in mid-2012, the company said in a statement
earlier today. Hydrocrackers are mainly used to produce diesel.  Ben-Mordechai will retire after a successor is found,
according to a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
