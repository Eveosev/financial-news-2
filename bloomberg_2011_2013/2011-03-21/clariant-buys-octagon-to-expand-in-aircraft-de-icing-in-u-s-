  Clariant AG (CLN) , a Swiss maker of
plastic additives, is acquiring Octagon Process LLC to expand in
de-icing and anti-icing fluids for aircraft in the U.S.  Octagon, a privately held, New York-based company has
annual sales of $90 million, Ulrich Steiner, Clariant’s chief
spokesman, said today by telephone. The Muttenz, Switzerland-
based company bought Octagon primarily to expand geographically,
he said.  Clariant supplies de-icing and anti-icing fluids for
aircraft as well as for runways, the company said. Terms of the
Octagon purchase weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
