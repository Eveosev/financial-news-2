Overseas investors sold a net 4.55
billion rupees ($100.9 million) of Indian stocks on March 18,
increasing total outflow from equities this year to 80.3 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 20.9 billion rupees of shares and sold
25.4 billion rupees, the Securities and Exchange Board of  India 
said  today . They sold a net 670 million rupees of bonds, paring
their purchases in debt this year to 140.7 billion rupees.  Global investors, attracted by India’s economic expansion,
bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of shares in 2010, lifting
the benchmark index 17 percent and making it the best performer
among the world’s 10 biggest equity markets. The gauge has shed
13 percent this year.  Foreign funds have placed 4.39 trillion rupees in equities
and 927.4 billion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. The previous record was in 2009 when flows
reached 834.2 billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18
years. Funds withdrew a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in
2008, setting off the worst annual slump.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
