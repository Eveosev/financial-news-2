Spot diesel fuel in the U.S. Gulf
Coast rose to the widest margin against futures in two weeks
after Petroleos de Venezuela SA reported a  power failure  at its
El Palito refinery and halted operations.  The disruption is the second in a week for Venezuelan
refineries, after PDVSA workers extinguished a fire at the Amuay
plant March 15. Production at the 130,000-barrel-a-day El Palito
refinery is expected to resume within hours, the company said.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the U.S. Gulf
Coast rose 0.2 cent to 3.5 cents versus futures at 2:11 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 3.08 cents to $3.0881 a gallon.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel gained 0.37 cent to a 9-cent
premium above futures in New York Harbor. Prompt delivery rose
2.91 cents to $3.1397 a gallon.  Distillate inventories on the East Coast declined 968,000
barrels to 55.9 million barrels last week, according to the
Energy Department, the lowest level since May 2009.  BP Plc will start the No. 1 fluid catalytic cracker at its
Texas City, Texas, refinery by March 25, according to a filing
with state regulators. The unit has been offline since mid-
January for planned work.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
