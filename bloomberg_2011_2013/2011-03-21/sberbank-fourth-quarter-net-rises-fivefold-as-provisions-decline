OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest
lender, said fourth-quarter profit jumped more than fivefold as
provisions for bad loans shrank.  Net income rose to 72 billion rubles ($2.6 billion) in the
final three months of 2010 from 14.1 billion rubles in the year-
earlier period, the Moscow-based company said in a statement on
its website today. Provisions dropped 96 percent to 3.8 billion
rubles in the same period, the lender said.  Full-year net income climbed to 181.6 billion rubles from
24.4 billion rubles in 2009. Sberbank’s non-performing loans
fell 1.3 percentage points in the fourth quarter to 7.3 percent
of the total, the lender said.  For the year, provisions declined 61 percent to 154 billion
rubles “as a result of a much slower growth of problem loans
against the backdrop of economic recovery in Russia,” the
lender said in its statement.  The bank’s interest income fell 2.4 percent to 795.6
billion rubles for the year as interest rates declined. Fee and
commission income jumped 24 percent to 130.9 billion rubles in
2010, according to the lender.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
