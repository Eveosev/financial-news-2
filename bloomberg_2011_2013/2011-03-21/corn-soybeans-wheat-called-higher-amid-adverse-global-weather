What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 6 cents to 9 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that
flooding and cool weather in the next month will delay U.S.
planting, reducing yield potential, said Greg Grow, the director
of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  as warm, dry weather may damage winter crops beginning
to develop in the southern U.S. Great Plains and wet, cold
weather slows spring seeding in the northern plains and Canadian
Prairies, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 4 cents to 6 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that rain will reduce yields and
delivery of crops to export terminals in  Brazil , increasing
demand for U.S. supplies, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.15 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open steady to up $1 for 2,000 pounds
of the  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
