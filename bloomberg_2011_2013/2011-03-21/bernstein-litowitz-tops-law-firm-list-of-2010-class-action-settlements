Bernstein Litowitz Berger &
Grossmann LLP recovered more money in class-action settlements
of investor lawsuits in 2010 than any other law firm, according
to a study that found 17 firms recouped more than $100 million
each.  Bernstein Litowitz represented the lead or co-lead
plaintiff in 16 lawsuits that settled last year totaling about
$1 billion, according to the study released today by RiskMetrics
Group’s Institutional Shareholder Services unit, which tracks
shareholder complaints.  San Diego-based Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd, which topped
the 2009 list, fell to second with $740.8 million followed by
Labaton Sucharow in  New York  in third place with $576.4 million.
Hargrove Pierson & Brown in  Boca Raton ,  Florida , and Marcus &
Auerbach in Jenkintown,  Pennsylvania , round out the top five
with $549.3 million each, according to the study. Robbins
Geller, which represents investors in suits filed against  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) , was also the most-
active firm by number of settlements with 31 deals.  Cunningham Bounds, based in Mobile,  Alabama , also posted
the highest average settlement amount among the top 50 law firms
ranked in the study, averaging $83.5 million in its three cases.
The firm served as co-lead counsel for bondholders in
settlements with  UBS AG (UBS) ,  HealthSouth Corp. (HLS)  and Ernst & Young LLP
over the health-care services provider’s demise.  New York-based RiskMetrics is a unit of  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) , which
develops investment indexes and analytics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
