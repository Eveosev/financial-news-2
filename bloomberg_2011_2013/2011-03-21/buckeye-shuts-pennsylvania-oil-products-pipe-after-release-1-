  Buckeye Partners LP (BPL)  said it expects
to restart a 10-inch pipeline carrying ultra-low-sulfur diesel
through  Pennsylvania  by the end of the week.  The line from Midland to Coraopolis was shut after a leak
yesterday. Buckeye is trying to determine how much fuel was
released and the cause of the leak, Colleen Kester, a company
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  “We still need to do some excavation work and put a sleeve
on it,” she said in an interview earlier today.  The line was shut “for all movements from the Midwest to
the Pittsburgh market,” according to a company e-mail today.
“Buckeye is assessing implications to delivery schedules
upstream of the incident.”  Petroleum product shot about 40 feet into the air
yesterday, according to a  filing  with the National Response
Center about the incident. Kester said she didn’t believe any of
the product leaked into local waterways.  Buckeye pipelines run from  New York  and Philadelphia
through Pennsylvania to as far as  St. Louis , according to the
company’s  website . The 5,400 miles (8,700 kilometers) of
pipelines transport gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and heating oil
to about 100 locations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
