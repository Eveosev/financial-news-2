Botswana plans to build a 5 million
liter bio-diesel plant supplied with meat tallow, the fatty off
cuts from slaughtered animals.  Work on the 89 million-pula ($13.5-million) project will
start this year, the Ministry of Minerals, Energy and Water
Resources told parliament today. The plant will convert to using
the jatropha plant after 2016.  The government should push ahead with the project, even
though it wonâ€™t be profitable at current  oil prices , because of
strategic reasons, the ministry said. Botswana currently imports
all its fuel needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
