UniCredit SpA,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, may acquire 7 percent of  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA)  after agreeing
to buy shares from  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) , according to two
people with the knowledge of the matter.  UniCredit agreed with Italy’s Ligresti family to pay about
170 million euros ($241 million) for Premafin’s rights in
Fondiaria’s planned share sale of as much as 460 million euros,
said the people who declined to be named as the agreement is not
official yet. The family owns Premafin, which controls
Fondiaria, Italy’s second-biggest insurer.  The Ligresti family is seeking new investors after
Groupama’s purchase of a stake in Premafin was halted by the
Italian market regulator. The UniCredit deal would cut
Premafin’s stake in Fondiaria to 34 percent from 42 percent.  UniCredit’s board should approve the purchase at a board
meeting tomorrow, when it has to approve full-year results, the
people said.  Officials at UniCredit, Premafin and Fondiaria declined to
comment on the transaction, which was reported earlier by Il
Sole 24 Ore.  Fondiaria, which posted a fifth consecutive quarterly loss
in the three months to Dec. 31, is selling assets and shares to
become profitable again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
