A turbine generator at Eskom
Holdings Ltd.’s Duvha power plant damaged in an explosion last
month may cost 3 billion rand ($430 million) to fix, News24
reported, citing spokeswoman Hillary Joffe.  The repair work may take as long as 18 months to be
completed, the Johannesburg-based Internet news site said,
citing people it didn’t identify. A new unit has to be ordered
and manufactured by French suppliers, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
