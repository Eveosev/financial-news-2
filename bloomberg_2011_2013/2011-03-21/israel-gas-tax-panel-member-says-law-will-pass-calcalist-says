Israeli Finance Ministry budget
director Udi Nissan, who is also a member of the government-
appointed Sheshinski committee that is discussing taxes on gas
and oil resources, expects Parliament’s finance committee to
approve the government’s tax proposal law in a meeting later
this week, the financial daily Calcalist said, citing an
interview with Nissan.   Nissan said he didn’t expect further concessions to be made
to gas companies in order for the proposal to pass, Calcalist
added.   To contact the reporter on this story:
