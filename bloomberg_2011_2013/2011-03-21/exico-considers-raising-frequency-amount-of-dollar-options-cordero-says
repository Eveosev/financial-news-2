  Mexico  may boost the amount and
frequency of its auctions of dollar options to boost
international reserves, Finance MinisterErnesto Cordero said.  The government is considering “increasing the rhythm of
international reserve accumulation,” Cordero said in an
interview with Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television’s “On
The Move” today. “But certainly that’s not going to be in such
an amount that it could affect the market in Mexico.”  Mexico is opposed to  capital controls  and doesn’t plan to
intervene to restrain the peso, which gained 4.9 percent in the
last 12 months, Cordero said. Mexico hasn’t followed moves by
regional peers and other developed nations to stem the
appreciation of their currencies as near-zero  interest rates  in
the U.S. and  Europe  prompt investors to seek higher returns in
faster-growing emerging markets.  The country has been holding monthly auctions of $600
million in options to buy dollars as it seeks to boost foreign
reserves after the peso reached a record low in 2009. Cordero
didn’t say by how much the auctions may increase.  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 12.0028 to the  U.S. dollar  at
6:38 a.m. New York time. The country’s foreign reserves rose to
a record high $122.1 billion in the week ending March 11, the
central bank said March 15.  “We’re not intervening in the market, we’re buying dollars
to accumulate international reserves,” said Cordero. “The
amount we’re accumulating, given that it’s very important to
build a buffer for external shock, is not enough to affect the
market."  Growth Outlook  The  Finance Ministry  expects a ‘‘very good rally” for
economic growth over the coming years and is likely to raise its
forecast for this year’s gross domestic product expansion to
more than 4 percent, Cordero said. The economy grew 5.5 percent
in 2010, the most in 10 years, after a 6.1 contraction in 2009.  Credit Suisse Group AG on March 17 increased its 2011
growth forecast for Mexico to 4.4 percent from 4 percent. Deputy
Finance Minister  Gerardo Rodriguez  said on Feb. 18 the economy
will probably grow more than 4.5 percent.  “Mexico will likely continue to stand out as a country
that is unwilling to fight aggressively with currency market
forces,”  Alonso Cervera , chief Latin America economist at
Credit Suisse Group in Mexico City, said in a March 17 report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
