  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s credit was cut to
underweight from marketweight by CreditSights Inc. in
anticipation that the debt the wireless carrier will take on
from its planned acquisition of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Mobile
USA for $39 billion will weaken its creditworthiness.  AT&T’s leverage could increase to as much as 2 times its
earnings from 1.6 times and may cause the cost of credit-default
swaps on the Dallas-based company to jump 70 basis points,
CreditSights analysts Ping Zhao and Anna Basanskaya wrote in a
note to clients today.  AT&T has an 18-month commitment for a $20 billion one-year
unsecured bridge loan underwritten by JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
according to a regulatory filing.   To contact the reporter on this story:
