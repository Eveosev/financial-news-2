  E.ON AG (EOAN) , Germanyâ€™s biggest utility,
is operating its Oskarshamn-3 nuclear reactor in southeast  Sweden  at reduced power.  Output at the 1,400-megawatt reactor was reduced yesterday
at 5:02 p.m. after a problem with a high-pressure turbine valve.
Production is being maintained at 450 megawatts and new
information will be released tomorrow evening, the Dusseldorf-
based company said in a statement distributed by the Nord Pool
exchange today.  The German utility owns 55 percent of the plant and  Fortum
Oyj (FUM1V)  of Finland the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
