  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the Wall
Street investment bank that last week told clients it would
donate some trading revenue to disaster-relief efforts in  Japan ,
said the fundraiser helped gather $5.25 million.  Jefferies will give $1 million on top of $3.65 million of
global net equity-trading revenue and employee contributions
totaling $600,000, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. The firm donated revenue from last week’s equity-
trading in  Asia  and global equity-trading generated on March 16.  The money will be distributed to “urgent, on-the-ground”
relief efforts, including $1.25 million to the American Red
Cross and $1 million to the United Nations Children’s Fund,
Jefferies said. At least 82 other financial institutions
worldwide had contributed about $73 million as of March 18. The
magnitude-9.0 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11 killed
more than 8,400 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.  “We greatly appreciate the participation and support of
our clients who directed their equity-trading business to
Jefferies, as well as our employee-partners who volunteered a
day’s salary to this worthy cause,” Chief Executive Officer
Richard Handler, 49, said in the statement.  Jefferies raised $7.5 million for victims of the 7.0-
magnitude earthquake that struck  Haiti  in January 2010, the
company said in a statement at the time. Clients generated $5.5
million of global trading commissions in a day, Jefferies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
