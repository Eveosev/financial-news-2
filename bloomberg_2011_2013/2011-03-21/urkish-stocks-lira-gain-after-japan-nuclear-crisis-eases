Turkish stocks and the lira gained
for the third day after  Japan ’s atomic crisis eased and U.S.
officials said allies were in full control of Libya’s airspace
following two days of airstrikes.  The main  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  climbed 0.4 percent
64,091.63 at 10:02 a.m. in Istanbul. The lira advanced 0.2
percent to 1.5752 per dollar, the highest level since March 15.
Two-year bonds were unchanged at a yield of 8.75 percent.  Appetite for riskier emerging market assets is increasing
after Japan made progress in cooling the Fukushima nuclear
reactor, Yasin Demir, a trader at Is Invest in Istanbul, said by
telephone. Turkish investors had already priced in a French and
British-led attack on Muammar Qaddafi’s military, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
