South Korea  plans to provide
financial support for the country’s small- and medium-sized
companies hurt by a record earthquake and tsunami that struck
 Japan  on March 11.  The South Korean government plans to make loans available,
extend maturities on existing debts and provide loan guarantees
via state-run financial institutions, the  Financial Services
Commission  and the Financial Supervisory Service said in an e-
mailed statement today.  South Korea’s Small & Medium Business Corp. will provide 30
billion won ($27 million) in loans to South Korean exporters and
importers that may have difficulties getting parts or materials
and will extend existing loan maturities by as long as 18 months,
today’s statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
