  BP Plc (BP/)  plans to halt a crude unit
at its Rotterdam refinery, Europe’s second-largest, for
maintenance in September, according to two people with knowledge
of the work.  The unit will shut for three to four weeks, the people
said, declining to be identified because they’re not authorized
to speak publicly about the plans.  Robert Wine , a BP spokesman
based at company headquarters in London, declined to comment.  BP’s Rotterdam refinery is able to process 400,000 barrels
of oil a day.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Pernis facility, also in
the Rotterdam area, is Europe’s largest, with a daily processing
capacity of 416,000 barrels. Refiners are required to idle
plants periodically for repairs and inspections.  The halt may boost fuel prices ahead of rising demand for
heating oil during the winter months. Gasoil, used in heating,
has risen 28 percent this year on refinery maintenance halts
this quarter and increasing crude oil costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
