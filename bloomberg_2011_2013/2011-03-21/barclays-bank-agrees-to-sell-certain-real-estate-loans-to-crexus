  Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s third-
largest bank, agreed to sell $586 million of commercial real
estate loans as it scales back its investments in property.    Crexus Investment Corp. (CXS) , a commercial mortgage real estate
investment trust, will buy the 30 loans, London-based Barclays
said in a statement today. Crexus is managed by Fixed Income
Discount Advisory Company, part of New York-based  Annaly Capital

assets that aren’t generating sufficient returns in relation to
the capital they require under the Basel III rules.  “The sale of the assets is part of continued efforts by
Barclays to manage its legacy commercial real estate assets for
value whilst reducing exposure over time,” Barclays said in
today’s statement.  Barclays advanced 8.4 pence, or 3 percent, to 290.5 pence
