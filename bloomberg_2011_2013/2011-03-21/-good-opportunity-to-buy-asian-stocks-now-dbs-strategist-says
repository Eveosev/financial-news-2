Joanne Goh, the regional equity
strategist for DBS Bank Ltd., comments on Asian stock markets.
She was speaking at a forum in Singapore:  On risk appetite:  “Risk appetite is actually quite low and everyone is just
staying on the sidelines, waiting for things to happen. It is
quite a good opportunity to get into some of the markets right
now. Investors are waiting for a resolution to  Japan ’s nuclear
reactors in the very short term.  ‘‘In the medium term, they are still waiting for an outcome
for the Libya crisis, to see whether the allied forces can do
the same as they did in  Kuwait  in the 1990s. In Kuwait, it took
seven months for the market to bottom and peak again.  ‘‘On the fundamentals, we are looking for inflation to
peak, which we think is happening in the very short term.
There’s a lot of room to fall and quite a good time to get into
equities right now.’’  On inflation:    China ’s consumer-price index typically peaked in February
in the past six years, Goh said.  ‘‘We think it’s quite near, based on historical data. Once
inflation starts to peak, market should find some kind of
relief, noting that the tightening concerns will slow down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
