  Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA (PGN)  said profit beat analysts’ estimates by 30
percent as  Poland ’s dominant gas company sold a record amount of
the fuel and reversed writedowns of distribution assets.  Net income almost doubled to 2.45 billion zloty ($858
million) from 1.24 billion zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-
based company known as PGNiG said in a regulatory statement
today. That exceeds the 1.89 billion-zloty mean estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Earnings were boosted by a 659 million-zloty writedown
reversal, the company said in a website  presentation  today.
PGNiG canceled the last of a 1.3 billion-zloty provision after
distribution assets lost less value than it had predicted in
2007. A similar operation also helped 2009 earnings.  The company sold a record 14.4 billion cubic meters of gas
in 2010, up from 13.3 billion cubic meters a year earlier. Both
individual and industrial customers increased demand as winter
temperatures fell and the economy accelerated.  PGNiG saved 158 million zloty in 2010 thanks to a new long-
term deal with OAO Gazprom. When it signed the contract last
year, after almost two years of negotiations, the company said
it could save as much as $250 million through 2014.  PGNiG imports about two-thirds of its gas from  Russia ,
buying the fuel at a price set in dollars based on a nine-month
average of oil-related products, and selling it at a rate set in
zloty by the regulator.  Rising oil prices prompted the company to ask Poland’s
energy watchdog for an increase in regulated prices. Leaving
rates at the current level would “significantly” decrease the
profitability of gas trading, the company said today.  PGNiG was allowed to raise prices twice last year, and cut
tariffs starting Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
