  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  revamped its
board in January to add international expertise and overcome
past disputes, not to underpin the position of Leo Apotheker,
the new chief executive officer, according to Chairman  Ray Lane ,
the Financial Times reported.  Lane told the newspaper that he interviewed all the
directors and decided who should be asked to leave; Apotheker
wasn’t involved, he said.  Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an adviser to
investors on corporate-governance matters, said this month that
the directors shouldn’t have let Apotheker play a direct role in
selecting five new directors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
