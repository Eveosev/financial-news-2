Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said a goal of his next budget is to maintain the
country’s plan to balance the budget, while taking some measures
to cement the recovery.  “One of the goals of the budget is to make sure we stay on
course, that we maintain the fiscal track” toward a balanced
budget, Flaherty told reporters at a pre-budget photo
opportunity in Ottawa. “At the same time, make some investment
to promote economic growth, jobs.”  Flaherty’s fiscal plan is scheduled to be presented at 4:00
p.m. New York time tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
