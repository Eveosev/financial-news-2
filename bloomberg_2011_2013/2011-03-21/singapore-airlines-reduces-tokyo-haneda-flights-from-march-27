  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  will pare
Tokyo Haneda services as a nuclear crisis saps travel demand in
the Japanese capital. The carrier will suspend a return service
from March 27, it said in a statement on its website. Another
flight will continue, it said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
