Hungary can’t help Russian energy
company OAO Surgutneftegas, which has been blocked from
exercising its  voting rights  in Hungarian refiner Mol Nyrt.,
Napi Gazdasag reported, citing Hungarian Development Minister
Tamas Fellegi.  The government doesn’t have a legal relationship with
Surgut so it doesn’t have tools to resolve the impasse, Fellegi
said after a meeting with Russian government officials last
week, the newspaper reported.  Surgut bought a 21.2 percent stake in Mol “at its own risk
and without complying with regulations,” the newspaper reported
Fellegi as saying.  Fellegi also said decisions by Mol shareholders on Surgut’s
voting rights, which have been ratified by Hungarian authorities
and courts, can’t be changed and the two companies need to come
to an agreement in line with the prevailing rules, Napi
reported.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
