  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  is investing $9.58
billion to help increase its power generation capacity in  India 
more than sevenfold by 2014.  The London-listed company is spending $8 billion to
construct 10 plants with a combined capacity of 8,070 megawatts,
Essar Energy said in an e-mailed statement today.  Essar Energy will spend $1.56 billion to build two more
plants totaling 1,800 megawatts and expects to have generation
capacity of 11,470 megawatts by the end of 2014 “subject to
securing fuel for the projects under development,” according to
the statement. The utility’s current capacity is 1,600
megawatts.  Three projects with a total of 2,910 megawatts of capacity
are scheduled to start in 2011. They include the 1,200-megawatt
Mahan-1 project in Madhya Pradesh state, for which the company
has asked  Coal India Ltd. (COAL)  to supply the fuel as Essar Energy is
awaiting approval to start its own mines.  The 1,200-megawatt Salaya-1 project, scheduled for
completion in the third quarter, and a 510-megawatt plant in
Vadinar will use imported coal, Essar Energy said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
