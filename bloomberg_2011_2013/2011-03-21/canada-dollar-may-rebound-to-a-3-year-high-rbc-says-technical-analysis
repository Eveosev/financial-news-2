  Canada ’s dollar may strengthen to
the highest in more than three years versus its U.S. counterpart
as last week’s slump toward parity with the greenback loses
momentum, RBC Capital Markets said, citing technical charts.  The loonie, as the currency is known for the aquatic bird
on the C$1 coin, may reach a “descending channel base” of
96.45 cents per U.S. dollar should it close stronger than 97.75
today, strategists led by George Davis, chief technical analyst
at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote in a client note today.
An exchange rate of 97.75 Canadian cents per U.S. dollar would
be the strongest since November 2007.  “A daily close below 97.75 would suggest that corrective
potential in USD-CAD is beginning to erode,”  RBC Capital
Markets  said in today’s note. “Upward price momentum is
eroding, exposing the low at 96.67 and the descending channel
base at 96.45 as the next downside price levels to watch.”  Canada’s dollar declined the most in more-than four months
last week, trading as weak as 99.74 on March 15, as the threat
of a nuclear power-plant meltdown in  Japan  damped investors’
appetite for higher-yielding assets. The loonie rallied the most
in almost seven weeks today as prices for oil, Canada’s biggest
export, rose on concern political turmoil in North Africa and
the Middle East may disrupt crude supplies.  RBC’s “medium-term technical price target” for the
Canadian dollar was 97.15, and the currency would have to close
weaker than 98.29 to “negate” the bank’s prediction for
recovery.  Canada’s dollar gained 0.7 percent to 97.75 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 11:35 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
