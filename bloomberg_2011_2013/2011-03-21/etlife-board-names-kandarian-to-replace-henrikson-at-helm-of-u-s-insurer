MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, promoted the manager who oversees its $450 billion
investment portfolio to be the next chief executive officer.  Steven Kandarian, 59, will replace Robert Henrikson on May
1, MetLife said yesterday in a statement. Henrikson, 63, who
expanded in Japan this year with the purchase of a life unit
from  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , will remain chairman
through the end of this year, New York-based MetLife said. He
reaches mandatory  retirement age  in 2012.  Kandarian’s portfolio has grown about  75 percent  in his six
years as chief investment officer, as Henrikson and  Robert Benmosche , who was MetLife CEO until 2006, acquired businesses
outside the U.S. Kandarian, a former private-equity executive,
braced MetLife for the housing slump by selling  Manhattan ’s
largest apartment complex in 2006 at a $3 billion gain.  “It may harken a change coming out of the crisis that
managing risk is going to be ascendant” over expansion of
sales, said  Steven Schwartz , an analyst with Raymond James &
Associates Inc. who has a “market perform” rating on MetLife.
“Kandarian comes with that mindset.”  MetLife built Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village on
Manhattan’s East side in the 1940s for soldiers returning from
World War II. Tishman Speyer Properties LP and BlackRock Inc.,
which purchased the 80-acre, 11,200-unit developments from
MetLife for $5.4 billion, defaulted on their $3 billion mortgage
in 2010.  Four Decades  Kandarian, who joined MetLife in 2005, is replacing a CEO
who has been with the firm for almost four decades. Henrikson
started at MetLife in 1972 as a sales representative.  Kandarian was executive director of Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp. from 2001 to 2004. He was an Orion Partners LP
managing partner and a managing director of Lee Capital
Holdings, a Boston-based private-equity firm, MetLife said.  MetLife slipped 74 cents to $43.85 at 5:12 p.m. yesterday
in extended trading in New York. It has advanced 6.6 percent in
the past year.  Kandarian is faced with integrating American Life Insurance
Co., the unit known as Alico that Henrikson bought from AIG for
$16.2 billion in November. The deal, which adds customers from
 Chile  to Poland to Japan, was MetLife’s biggest, ahead of the
$11.7 billion acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity that
Benmosche completed in 2005. Benmosche is now the CEO of New
York-based AIG.  Kandarian oversees more than $320 billion in fixed-income
holdings, including corporate debt,  government bonds  and asset-
backed securities. The company has more than $50 billion in
mortgages. The Alico acquisition prompted Kandarian to scale
back holdings of financial-firm corporate debt because of a
“heavy concentration” in the securities.  “Mr. Kandarian is a known quantity for the investment
community,” said Jonathan Hatcher, a strategist who covers
financial institutions at Jefferies Group Inc. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
