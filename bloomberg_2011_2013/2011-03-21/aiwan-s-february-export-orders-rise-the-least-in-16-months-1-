  Taiwan ’s export orders increased by
the least in 16 months as demand from  Japan  declined and
purchases from China moderated.  Orders, an indication of shipments in the next one to three
months, climbed 5.33 percent from a year earlier, after a 13.47
percent gain in January, the  Ministry of Economic Affairs  said
in Taipei today. The median estimate of 13 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 13.7 percent advance.  The slowdown may not deter the central bank from continuing
to raise  interest rates  even as Japan, the island’s fourth-
largest export destination, faces disruption to trade after its
biggest earthquake on record. The monetary authority meets March
31 to debate whether to join neighbors from China to  South Korea 
in boosting rates as it tries to avert a property bubble.  “The central bank needs to deal with price pressure
internally so it won’t stop tightening because of weak external
demand,”  Tony Phoo , an economist at Standard Chartered Plc in
Taipei, said before the report. It may raise rates by 0.125
percentage point to 1.75 percent at the first quarterly policy
meeting of 2011 next week, Phoo said.  Orders from Japan may continue to fall in the coming months
following the nation’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami, said
Beatrice Tsai, deputy director-general of the economic
ministry’s statistics department. They declined in February
because the Japanese economy weakened, she said.  Japan Damage  Japan, the world’s third-biggest economy, may face damage
of as much as 10 trillion yen ($124 billion), or 2 percent of
gross domestic product, Citigroup said in a report last week.
The disasters may lead to a temporary slowdown in growth which
will have a modest short-term impact on East Asia and the
Pacific, the  World Bank  said in a report today.  The Taiex stock index closed up 0.9 percent before the
release, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Taiwan
dollar  rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.572 against its U.S.
counterpart at the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei Forex Inc.    HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s largest maker of handsets using
Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. operating systems, said last
week the company is not short of materials and has been in close
contact with its suppliers in Japan since the magnitude-9
temblor.  Japan makes almost 40 percent of the world’s electronics
and audio-visual components, according to Daiwa Securities Group
Inc.  Property Prices    Home prices  in Taipei rose 12.2 percent last year to a
record, according to Dave Chiou, a Taipei-based analyst at
Citigroup Inc. Taiwan’s Cabinet this month approved a proposal
to impose a tax on property sales to curb speculation.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by
0.125 percentage point in June, September and December last year.
The discount rate on 10-day loans to banks now stands at 1.625
percent.  Exports helped propel Taiwan’s annual economic growth to a
24-year high in 2010 and are set to jump more than 11 percent
this year, according to government projections.  The value of export orders declined to $28.87 billion last
month from $34.46 billion in January, today’s report showed.  Orders from Japan fell 10.41 percent from a year earlier.  China  and  Hong Kong  combined increased 2.7 percent from a year
earlier, after rising 7.22 percent in January. Purchases from
the U.S. climbed 16.91 percent, compared with a 17.97 percent
gain the previous month.  Orders for electronics rose 2.72 percent in February,
following a 9.85 percent increase the previous month. Demand for
information technology and communications products declined 3.59
percent after advancing 6.83 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
