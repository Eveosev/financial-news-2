(Corrects name to Luiz Sergio Oliveira in first paragraph.)  Brazilian lawmakers may not support
a decree cutting earmark spending, Valor Economico newspaper
reported, citing an interview with Institutional Affairs
Minister Luiz Sergio Oliveira.  Not a single lawmaker will support a decree signed by
President  Dilma Rousseff  cutting 18 billion reais ($10.8
billion) that was pledged for earmarks but not spent in the
2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 budgets, Oliveira said, according to
the Sao Paulo-based paper.  Lawmakers expected the government to honor the earmarks
based on another decree signed by former President  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva  last year, Valor said.  Congress can overturn Rousseffâ€™s decree by majority vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
