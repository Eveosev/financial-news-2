OAO Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s state-controlled gas producer, extended last week’s
gains as allied air strikes in Libya raised concern supplies of
the commodity from North Africa may be disrupted.  The shares rose 3.3 percent to 149.73 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, after climbing 0.4 percent last week.
Gazprom Neft has rallied 17 percent so far this year.  Allied air strikes in Libya threatened to prolong a supply
disruption in Africa’s third-biggest producer today. Crude for
April delivery climbed 1.4 percent to $102.52 per barrel in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
