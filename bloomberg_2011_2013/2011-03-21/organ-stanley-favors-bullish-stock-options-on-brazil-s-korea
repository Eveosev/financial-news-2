  Morgan Stanley (MS)  recommended bullish
options on  South Korea  stocks, saying the Asian nation will
benefit from “uncertainties” about the Japanese recovery.  South Korea has the industries such as auto and steel that
can substitute for the drop in Japanese production, equity
derivatives analysts including  Viktor Hjort  said in a report to
clients dated March 18. The analysts also favored call options
on Brazilian stocks, saying that food inflation “seems to be in
check” while strong demand may allow the economy to grow 4
percent this year.  “Within emerging markets, we favor 3-month 110% calls in
Brazil on the Bovespa for 1.3%, owing to a modestly constructive
fundamental story within EM and a commodity producer status,”
the analysts said. “We also like 3-month 105% calls on the
KOSPI for 1.9% given low relative volatility and steep skew.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
