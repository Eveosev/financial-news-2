Piraeus Port Authority SA , operator
of  Greece â€™s largest harbour, said it will provide docking
services for less than a private company is currently charging
at the port.  Piraeus Port will cut the docking fee for  cruise ships  to
125 euros ($177.3) from 250 euros and for cargo vessels to 75
euros from 150 euros, the authority said today in an e-mailed
statement. The authority will charge passenger ferry companies
between 200 and 950 euros a month, depending on the size of the
ship, rather than a fee each time a vessel arrives or leaves the
port, according to the statement.  The number of cruise ship arrivals scheduled for 2011,
based on information from cruise ship operators, is set to rise
to 962 from 823 last year, the authority said March 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
