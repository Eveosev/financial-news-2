Egyptian authorities rearrested the
brother of  Ayman al-Zawahiri , the top aide to Osama bin Laden,
the Interior Ministry said in a statement on its Facebook page.  Mohammed al-Zawahiri was arrested on March 19, two days
after being freed, the statement said citing a security source.
He will be taken to the military prosecution office in
connection with a sentence issued against him in absentia in a
case dating back to 1998, it said.  Since last month’s ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak ,
authorities have released hundreds of political prisoners,
including Islamists. Among those freed are Abboud and Tarek El-
Zomor, who were imprisoned for their role in the assassination
of former President Anwar Sadat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
