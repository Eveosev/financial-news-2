  Turkey  will pay for up to half the
cost of the foreign marketing campaigns of universities,
hospitals and film producers, Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan
said.  The government will provide up to $300,000 a year per
applicant to support businesses in health, education, software
and cinema, Caglayan said in comments carried by state-run news
agency Anatolia. The government is backing the industries
because it foresees potential new sales of up to $25 billion a
year, he said.  Turkey is expanding support for exporters as a domestic
demand boom draws in imports, causing a widening current-account
deficit that Moody’s Investor Services says is a “key risk” to
the economy. The deficit in January almost doubled from a year
earlier to $5.9 billion, the 13th consecutive month it’s
expanded.  To contact the reporters on this story:
