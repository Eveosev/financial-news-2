Uganda,  Democratic Republic of
Congo  and the  United Nations  are planning a joint operation
against two Ugandan rebel groups operating in Congo,  New Vision 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  The assault on the Lord’s Resistance Army and the Allied
Democratic Forces was agreed at a meeting on March 18 in
Uganda’s western town of Kasese, the Kampala-based newspaper
reported.  The two rebel groups fled to Congo after they were weakened
by Ugandan forces, New Vision said.  Uganda fought a two-decade war with the Lord’s Resistance
Army, whose leader, Joseph Kony, claims to defend the interests
of his Acholi people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
