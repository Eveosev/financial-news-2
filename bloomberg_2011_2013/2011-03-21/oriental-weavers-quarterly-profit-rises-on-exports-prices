Oriental Weavers (ORWE)  Co., the biggest
machine-made rug maker in the world, posted a 37 percent
increase in fourth-quarter profit on higher sales and prices.  Net income from operation activities climbed to 107.4
million Egyptian pounds ($18.1 million) from 78.2 million pounds
a year earlier, the Cairo-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Strong sales growth was driven by significant export
expansion as Oriental Weavers captured new market share and
higher prices in  North America  and Europe and filled rising
demand in emerging markets including China, Russia, Africa and
the rest of Asia,” Oriental Weavers said in a statement.  Sales in the three months ended December rose 15 percent to
1.12 billion pounds, from 973 million pounds a year earlier.  “Given the impact on raw materials prices of rapidly
rising  oil prices  in recent weeks, we may consider price
increases in addition to a more balanced product mix combining
natural fibers and synthetic fibers,” the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
