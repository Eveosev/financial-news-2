  Adidas AG (ADS)  will switch to using
cotton produced under the Better Cotton Initiative
sustainability guidelines by 2018,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
an interview with Frank Henke, the company’s director of social
and environmental affairs.  The change won’t result in higher prices, the newspaper
quoted Henke as saying in a preview of an article to be
published tomorrow. The company doesn’t plan a switch to organic
cotton, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
