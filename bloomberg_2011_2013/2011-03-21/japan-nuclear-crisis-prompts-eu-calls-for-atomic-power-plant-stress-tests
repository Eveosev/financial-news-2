European Union energy ministers
predicted it would take months to start EU-wide nuclear “stress
tests” as  Germany  led a push for stringent common rules and
said national leaders must tackle the matter later this week.  The energy ministers from the 27-nation EU said checks on
the region’s 143 atomic plants following Japan’s nuclear
accident would probably get under way in the second half of this
year on a voluntary basis. The tests may cover threats from
earthquakes, floods, airplane crashes and terrorists as well as
reactors’ cooling systems and their age, said EU officials.  “I’m not sure that all countries will proceed in as
demanding a manner as we have planned in Germany,” German
Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle, who also handles  energy
policy , told reporters in Brussels after the emergency EU
meeting. He said his support for mandatory European tests failed
to win the backing of some participants.  Nuclear power stations owned by companies including
Germany’s  RWE AG (RWE)  and Electricite de France SA produce a third of
the electricity in the EU, which wants to draw up common
criteria to gauge nuclear safety in response to the Japanese
crisis. The risk of a nuclear meltdown in Japan after a March 11
earthquake and tsunami triggered public protests in  Europe 
against atomic power and prompted Germany to order a temporary
halt to the country’s seven oldest reactors.  Support for Merkel  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has urged uniform standards
across the EU and said she will raise the issue at a March 24-25
meeting of the bloc’s leaders. She decided last week that
Germany will keep its seven oldest nuclear reactors offline as
part of the nationwide safety review to run through June.  Merkel’s Christian Democratic party dropped votes and the
Greens doubled their support yesterday in the first electoral
test of Germany’s response to  Japan ’s accident. The vote in the
eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt was the second of seven German
regional ballots this year.  EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said the bloc
must come up with a checklist reflecting the concerns of
European and national authorities, including in countries that
don’t produce atomic energy. Oettinger, Bruederle and Hungarian
National Development Minister Tamas Fellegi recommended that
non-EU nations bordering the bloc such as Switzerland and  Turkey 
also be involved in the tests.  “We should aim to have this assessment under way before
the end of the year,” said Fellegi, who chaired the energy
meeting because  Hungary  holds the EU’s rotating presidency. “We
should avoid any hasty decisions.”  Lower Emissions  It’s up to national governments in the EU to decide whether
to use nuclear power, which is produced in 14 member countries.
Safety is a shared responsibility between national and EU
authorities.  France , which gets about 80 percent of its electricity from
nuclear plants, stressed that national authorities are
responsible for deciding on the life of atomic plants. French
reactors will remain a “fundamental” source of energy for the
country, said Industry Minister Eric Besson.  “Because the safety of nuclear-power plants has direct
consequences across borders, it is important that there will be
a uniform stress test,” said Dutch Economic Affairs Minister
Maxime Verhagen. “If the outcome of the stress test gives
reason to act, measures have to be taken.”  Atomic power helps the EU both to diversify its energy mix
and, because it emits almost no carbon dioxide, to shift to a
low-carbon economy, according to the European Commission, the
bloc’s regulatory arm. The EU is on track to reduce  greenhouse
gases  including CO2 by 20 percent in 2020 from 1990 levels and
is considering a deeper reduction over the period.  Nuclear-Safety Law  Bruederle said a “reasonable dialogue” is needed among EU
governments on common stress tests. He refused to speculate
about whether Germany’s checks on its seven oldest atomic plants
could lead one or more of them to be shut permanently.  EU governments in 2009 set their first common standards for
the construction and operation of atomic reactors, saying the
industry’s growth requires steps to ease public anxiety about
the risks. A draft law proposed last year would broaden EU
safety oversight by setting bloc-wide standards for nuclear-
waste disposal.  Oettinger said he would recommend a tightening next year of
the 2009 EU nuclear-safety law.  To contact the reporters on this story:
