Grubb & Ellis Co. (GBE)  hired investment
bank JMP Securities LLC to help it consider strategic
alternatives including a sale or merger, the commercial real
estate brokerage said today in a regulatory  filing .  “We believe now is the time to explore opportunities on
how to best leverage the broad platform and capabilities of the
company into an improving market for the benefit of all
stakeholders,” C. Michael Kojaian, chairman of the  Santa Ana ,
California-based company, said in a statement.  Grubb & Ellis has received unsolicited inquiries and
decided “a formal process is in the best interest of all of our
constituents,” Kojaian said. The brokerage, with a market
capitalization of $68 million, helps clients lease, buy, sell
and manage commercial real estate. Its stock has fallen 23
percent this year, closing at 98 cents a share today in  New York 
Stock Exchange composite trading.  Commercial real estate transactions may climb 40 percent to
$135 billion this year, Chicago-based brokerage  Jones Lang
LaSalle Inc. (JLL)  said on Feb. 2. Prices of commercial properties
sold by institutional investors surged 19 percent in 2010, the
second-biggest gain on record, according to an index developed
by the MIT Center for Real Estate in Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  Grubb & Ellis, in conjunction with today’s announcement,
said it won’t pay a quarterly dividend to holders of its 12
percent convertible preferred stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
