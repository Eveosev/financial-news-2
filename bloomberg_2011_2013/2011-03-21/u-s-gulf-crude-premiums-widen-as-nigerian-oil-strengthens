U.S. Gulf crude premiums
strengthened versus West  Texas  Intermediate as the value of
foreign imports, such as  Nigeria ’s Qua Iboe oil, climbed because
of the conflict in  Libya .  The price of low-sulfur U.S. grades, which compete with
West African oil, rose as Qua Iboe strengthened 7 cents to a
premium of $3.97 a barrel today over European-benchmark Dated
Brent. That is the highest level for the Nigerian grade since
July 22, 2008.  Premiums for sweet crudes have surged because of the loss
of Libyan oil exports as a result of civil unrest.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 30 cents to
$15.70 a barrel at 12:04 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI
strengthened 20 cents to $15.55 a barrel.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
was unchanged at $10.25 a barrel over the benchmark. Poseidon’s
premium was widened 5 cents to $10.40.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 85 cents to
$10.10 a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium strengthened 20 cents
to $12.30 a barrel over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 3.65 a barrel.
WTS is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less
influenced by imports.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $13 a barrel. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in  Alberta . The discount for Western Canada Select remained at
$19.25 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
