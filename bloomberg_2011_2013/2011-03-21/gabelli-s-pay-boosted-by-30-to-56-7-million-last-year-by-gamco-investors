Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)  raised Chief
Executive Officer  Mario Gabelli ’s compensation by 30 percent to
$56.7 million in 2010, a year during which the firm’s shares
returned 3.9 percent.  Gabelli, who earned $43.6 million in 2009, didn’t get a
base salary, bonus or  stock options , the Rye, New York-based
firm said today in a regulatory filing. His pay was composed
entirely of “incentive-based variable compensation,” according
to the filing.  Gabelli, 68, whose firm manages about $32.5 billion in
assets, is the highest-paid CEO among publicly traded money
managers. BlackRock Inc.’s Laurence D. Fink, who oversees $3.56
trillion in assets, received compensation valued at $15.9
million in 2009. Mark Fetting, the head of Legg Mason Inc., was
paid $4.61 million in the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2010.
Both firms haven’t disclosed compensation for 2010.  Gamco’s net income rose 24 percent in 2010 to $69 million,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm’s stock
increased 3.9 percent last year, including dividends, compared
with a 21 percent, including dividends, for the Russell 2000
Financial Services Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gamco’s second-highest paid executive was Douglas Jamieson,
56, president and chief operating officer. His pay rose 11
percent to $3.9 million, according to today’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
