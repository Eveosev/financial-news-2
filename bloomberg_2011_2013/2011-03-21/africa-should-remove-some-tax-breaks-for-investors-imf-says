The  International Monetary Fund 
said sub-Saharan African nations should focus on improving their
investment climates, while moving away from offering tax breaks
that result in lost government revenue.  “The importance of these incentives is much exaggerated in
respect to what they actually yield,” Carlo Cottarelli, the
fund’s director of fiscal affairs, said today in an interview in
Kenya’s capital, Nairobi. “Creating a good business
environment, fighting corruption, these are more effective at
attracting investment than incentives.”  Policy makers and fiscal advisers from 40 African nations
have gathered in Nairobi for talks aimed at strengthening  tax
revenue  on a continent where many countries depend on donor aid
to help fund state-spending plans. Weak tax laws, poor payment
systems and graft are some of the factors hampering domestic
revenue collection in  Africa .  Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy, plans to “simplify”
its requirements for  tax payments  in the 2011-12 budget to
improve efficiency and boost revenue, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  told reporters at the same event today.  The measures may include removing value-added tax
exemptions, he said. Kenya’s VAT rate is 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
