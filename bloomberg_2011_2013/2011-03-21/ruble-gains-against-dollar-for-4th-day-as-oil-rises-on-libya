The ruble gained for a fourth day
against the dollar, rising to its strongest closing level since
March 5, as the price of oil rose above $103 on concern an
allied attack on  Libya  could disrupt crude supply.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 28.3150 per
dollar at the 5 p.m. close of trading in Moscow trading,
bringing its four-day increase to 1.8 percent. The Russian
currency is 13 kopeks, or 0.5 percent weaker than on March 3
when it closed at 28.1850, the strongest level since December
2008.  Crude for April delivery climbed as much as $2.28 to
$103.35 a barrel in  New York  and the more-actively traded May
futures rose as much as $2.42 to $104.27 a barrel.  Muammar
Qaddafi  vowed to repel air attacks by allied forces and the
chairman of Libya’s national oil company said crude output has
fallen to a quarter of pre-crisis production.  Investors pared bets that the ruble will weaken, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the currency at 28.4740 per dollar
in three months, down from 28.8988 on March 18. The contracts
provide a guide to expectations of currency moves and interest
rate differentials.  The ruble added 0.4 percent to 40.1125 against the euro,
its first gain since March 16, leaving it at 33.6239, the
strongest level since March 10, against the central bank’s
target currency basket, which is used to manage swings that hurt
Russian exporters. The basket is calculated by multiplying the
dollar’s rate to the ruble by 0.55, the euro to ruble rate by
0.45, then adding them together.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, John Kohut  To contact the reporters on this story:
