President  Barack Obama  said Latin
America has become an important contributor to prosperity in the
U.S. as the region embraces democracy and free-market economics.  Latin America has cast off “the old stereotype of a region
in perpetual conflict or trapped in endless cycles of poverty”
to become a driver of economic growth and key participant in
international affairs, Obama said today in the text of a speech
he’s delivering in Santiago, Chile.  “The world must now recognize Latin America for the
dynamic and growing region that it truly is,” Obama said.
“When Latin America is more prosperous, the United States is
more prosperous.”  Obama, who was in  Brazil  yesterday and travels to  El
Salvador  tomorrow, is on a trip aimed at strengthening ties with
the region and promoting U.S. business interests.  Today he said trade with the region will soon support 2
million U.S. jobs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
