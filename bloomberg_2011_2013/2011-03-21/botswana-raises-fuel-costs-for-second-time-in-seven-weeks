Botswana’s government raised fuel
prices with effect from midnight, seven weeks after the previous
increase.  Gasoline costs rose 10 thebe to 6.70 pula ($1.02) a liter,
while diesel increased by 10 thebe to 6.85 pula, the Ministry of
Minerals, Energy and Water Resources said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “The price adjustment is caused by increases in crude  oil
prices  internationally,” the ministry said.  Higher fuel costs were one of the reasons inflation
accelerated to 8.5 percent in February from 7.9 percent the
month before, the  Central Statistics Office  said on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
