Slovakia will introduce a special
bank tax in 2012,  Pravda  quoted Finance Minister Ivan Miklos as
saying.  Even as the government prefers a coordinated approach by
the European Union, Slovakia is ready to proceed on its own
should the 27-country bloc fail to reach an agreement, Miklos
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
