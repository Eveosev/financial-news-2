European Union Internal Market
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said the EU plans to introduce
compulsory transparency rules for mining and forestry companies,
which will oblige them to disclose any financial dealings,
including tax payments and royalties, they have with foreign
governments, the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  The new rules, which will form part of the EU’s revision of
existing transparency requirements at the end of the year, are
likely to apply to mining, energy and forestry industries, the
FT said, citing Barnier. The disclosures would be made on a
“country-by-county” basis rather than on a “project-by-
project” basis, he said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
