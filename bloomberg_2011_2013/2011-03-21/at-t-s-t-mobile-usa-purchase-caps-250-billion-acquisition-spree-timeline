The following details AT&T Inc.’s
acquisitions since its breakup. AT&T’s plan to buy  T-Mobile USA 
from  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  for $39 billion, creating the largest
U.S. wireless carrier, caps more than $250 billion of purchases
over two decades, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  1876: Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone, leading to
the formation of the Bell Telephone Company, later becoming the
American Telephone & Telegraph Company and then AT&T.  January 1982: AT&T and the  U.S. Department of Justice  sign a
Modification of Final Judgment that ends an antitrust suit and
splits the company up.  January 1984: AT&T Corp. is split into seven Regional Bell
Operating Companies. These “Baby Bells” later merged or were
renamed to form operators including Verizon and Qwest. AT&T held
onto the long-distance business and spun off Bells Labs to
become Lucent Technologies Inc.  September 1994: AT&T finishes its $11.5 billion acquisition of
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. after the Federal
Communications Commission clears the way for the combination of
the U.S.’s largest long-distance service provider and the
largest cellular operator.  December 1994: SBC Communications Inc., a Baby Bell formerly
known as Southwestern Bell Corp., buys Associated Communications
Corp. for $680 million.  September 1996: AT&T completes its spinoff of Lucent
Technologies Inc., its systems-and-equipment unit.  December 1996: AT&T completes its $3.4 billion spinoff of  NCR
Corp. (NCR) , its computer business, officially restructuring the
company.  April 1997: SBC closes acquisition of a fellow Baby Bell,
Pacific Telesis Group, for more than $16 billion.  October 1998: SBC acquires Southern New England
Telecommunications Corp. for $6.74 billion, giving the then-No.2
local phone operator access to the northeastern U.S. market
dominated by Bell Atlantic Corp.  February 1999: AT&T receives approval from shareholders and the
Federal Communications Commission for its $57.5 billion purchase
of Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 U.S. cable-television
company.  May 1999:  AT&T completes the U.S. portion of its $5 billion
acquisition of International Business Machines Corp.’s global
communications network, ahead of schedule.  July 1999: SBC acquires Comcast Corp.’s cellular business for
$1.67 billion, putting the operator in nine of the top 10 U.S.
markets.  October 1999: SBC buys No. 5 operator Ameritech Corp. for a
final value of $84 billion, making it the largest U.S. local
phone company. SBC was required to sell about half of
Ameritech’s wireless units as a condition for regulatory
approval. They were sold for $3.25 billion.  June 2000: SBC buys a 43 percent stake in Prodigy Communications
Corp. as part of a venture to combine their Internet businesses.
SBC later buys the remainder of Prodigy for $390 million.  October 2000: AT&T says it will divide into four separate
companies in 2002 to reverse a stock slide that cut its market
value more than $61.5 billion in 2000.  August 2001: Liberty Media Corp. is split off from AT&T, a move
that gave Chairman  John Malone  more freedom to raise money and
invest in cable-television systems.  December 2001: Comcast Corp. agrees to buy AT&T’s cable-
television unit for $72 billion in stock and assumed debt,
ending AT&T’s plan to deliver everything from phone calls to
digital movies on demand through one cable line.  January 2005: SBC announces plan to buy AT&T after AT&T posted
declining revenue for 20 straight quarters. SBC completes
purchase of AT&T for $22 billion, including debt. The combined
entity is later renamed  AT&T Inc. (T)   January 2007: AT&T Inc. closes its acquisition of Bell South
Corp., including consolidation of their Cingular Wireless
venture. The final value passes $102 billion, including debt.  April 2007: AT&T posts quarterly net income that almost doubles
to $2.85 billion after its acquisitions reaped $900 million in
savings. AT&T has 62.2 million wireless customers and 12.9
million high-speed Internet customers by the end of the first
quarter of 2007.  April 2007: AT&T Chief Executive  Ed Whitacre  retires at 65 after
17 years leading Southwestern Bell, SBC and AT&T. He led the
