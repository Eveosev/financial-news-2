The Australian dollar touched the
highest in more than a week and  New Zealand ’s currency rose
versus the greenback as Asian stocks advanced and higher prices
for commodities boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s dollar was also bolstered after the
 International Monetary Fund  said the nation’s central bank may
need to raise  interest rates  “relatively quickly” once the
economy begins to recover. Australia’s currency held above $1
per greenback for a second day as oil maintained yesterday’s
advance after allied forces expanded their air campaign over
Libya.  “The situation in the Middle East is putting upward
pressure on the price of gold and oil, and that in isolation
benefits commodity-bloc currencies,” said  Tim Waterer , a
foreign-exchange dealer with CMC Markets in Sydney. “The stock
market reaction to the Libyan actions over the past few days has
been quite positive as there’s a hope there will be a quick
resolution.”  Australia ’s currency rose 0.5 percent to $1.0112 at 12:04
p.m. in  New York  from $1.0063 yesterday. The Aussie touched
$1.0129, the highest since March 11. It gained 0.4 percent to
81.89 yen from 81.54 yen. New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.7 percent
to 74.10 U.S. cents from 73.57 cents and increased 0.7 percent
to 60.02 yen from 59.61 yen.  Oil Trends  Crude oil rose 1.3 percent to $103.68 per barrel in
electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It
touched $103.80 per barrel, the highest since March 14, as the
airstrikes threatened to prolong a supply disruption.  The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials increased
0.1 percent. Raw materials account for a majority of exports
from Australia and New Zealand. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index
gained 2.2 percent.  New Zealand’s economy will grow 1 percent this year before
earthquake rebuilding boosts the expansion to 4 percent in 2012,
the  IMF  said as part of an annual review of the country’s
economy.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand’s half percentage-point cut
in the official cash rate to 2.5 percent this month was
appropriate, the fund said. The rate could be lifted
“relatively quickly” should inflation pressures mount, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
