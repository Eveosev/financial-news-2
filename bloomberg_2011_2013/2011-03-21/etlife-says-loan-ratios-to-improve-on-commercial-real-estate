  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said it expects the loan-to-value ratio to decline in
the company’s commercial real-estate-lending portfolio this year
as property prices rebound.  ‘Based on the trends in the market today, we expect values
will continue to increase, and the average loan-to-value will
continue to decrease in 2011,” said Robert Merck, a senior
managing director for New York-based MetLife, at an investor
conference today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
