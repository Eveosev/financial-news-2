Second baseman Luis Castillo signed
a minor-league contract with the  Philadelphia Phillies , three
days after the former All-Star was released by the  New York
Mets .  Castillo, who is still owed $6 million by the Mets, will
report to Phillies’ spring training as a non-roster invitee, the
Phillies said in a news release.  The 35-year-old Castillo is a .290 career hitter with 28
home runs, 59 triples, 443 runs batted in and 370 stolen bases.
The three-time All-Star was hitting .286 in 11 games for the
Mets during spring training. He batted .235 for New York last
season.  Castillo’s signing comes with Phillies All-Star second
baseman  Chase Utley  having missed all of spring training because
of pain in his knee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
