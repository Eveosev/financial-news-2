Cyprus will raise  Turkey ’s plan to
build a nuclear power plant on its southern coast at a meeting
of European Union energy ministers today, said Antonis Paschalides, Cyprus’s commerce, industry and tourism minister.  “Turkey’s plans to construct a nuclear station at Akkuyu
are a cause of concern after developments in Japan,”
Paschalides said in an interview with Bloomberg News yesterday.
“Akkuyu lies in an area with seismic activity and Cyprus is
just 40 miles away.”  Turkish Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said March 14 that
Turkey will ask Russia’s Rosatom Corp. and Atomstroyexport ZAO,
which have been picked to build the power plant, to tighten the
planned safety standards.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  outlined  Greece ’s
concerns about the plant to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his Turkish
counterpart, on March 18, according to an e-mailed statement
from Papandreou’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
