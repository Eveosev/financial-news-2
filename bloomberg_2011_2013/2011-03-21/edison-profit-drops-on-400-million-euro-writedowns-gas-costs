  Edison SpA (EDN) ,  Italy ’s second-largest
power producer, reported a 91 percent slump in 2010 profit
because of writedowns and costlier long-term natural gas supply
contracts.  Profit fell to 21 million euros ($30 million) in 2010 from
240 million euros after the company posted writedowns of more
than 400 million euros, Milan-based Edison said in a statement
today. The company said it won’t pay a dividend.  Edison is in the process of renegotiating gas contracts,
signed when  oil prices  were higher, that forced the company to
pay more for the fuel than it can sell it for. The company said
costly gas contracts will hurt this year’s earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which it estimates
will fall to about 900 million euros from 1.37 billion euros in
2010.  “I don’t see further deterioration of margins” beyond
what has already been announced, Chief Executive Officer Umberto Quadrino said on a conference call. “It won’t get worse than
this.”  Quadrino also said a drop in gas supplies because of the
current conflict in  Libya  hasn’t been negative for the company
because it reduced take-or-pay contract margins.  Egyptian Assets  Writedowns announced today included 213 million euros
related to the company’s Egyptian assets such as the Abu Qir
field concession, and 140 million euros because of lower
earnings from thermoelectric plants, according to the statement.  Last month, Edison shareholder Electricite de France SA
reported a 74 percent slump in 2010 earnings, partly due to a
provision of 915 million euros for financial risks related to
Italy. The French company didn’t give a breakdown at the time.  Edison said 2010 sales rose 18 percent to 10.4 billion
euros, boosted by increased demand for electricity. Net debt
fell to 3.71 billion euros in 2010 from 3.86 billion euros.  Results were approved a week late amid strained relations
between EDF and Edison’s Italian shareholders. EDF and the
Italian investors said in a joint March 15 statement that they
had extended a deadline for revoking their shareholder agreement
until Sept. 15.  EDF controls about 50 percent of Edison through direct and
indirect stakes and has been pushing for more management
control.  A2A SpA (A2A) , Italy’s biggest municipal utility, controls 51
percent of holding company Delmi SpA, which jointly owns
Transalpina di Energia with EDF. Transalpina holds 61.2 percent
of Edison.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
