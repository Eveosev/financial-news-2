The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options dropped the most in 10 months as equities advanced,
 Japan  made progress in cooling nuclear reactors at a crippled
plant, and allied forces attacked military targets in Libya.  The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, dropped 16 percent, the most since May, to
20.61. The index measures the cost of using options as insurance
against declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which
gained 1.5 percent to 1,298.38.  The S&P 500 recouped most of last week’s 1.9 percent loss
as Japanese Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said progress is being made
in restoring power to two nuclear reactors damaged by the March
11 temblor and tsunami. Officials of a coalition that includes
the U.S., U.K. and  France  said air and missile strikes in Libya
have effectively grounded Muammar Qaddafi’s air force. The VIX
gained 22 percent last week to the highest level since August.  VIX futures expiring in April fell 7.5 percent to 21.60,
while the VIX June 32.50 calls, which were the most-active VIX
options, tumbled 28 percent to $1.30.  In Europe, the benchmark gauge of stock-market volatility
fell for a third day. The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost
of protecting against a decline in shares on the Euro Stoxx 50
Index, dropped 12 percent to 25.24 in Frankfurt. The Euro Stoxx
50 stock index added 2.4 percent to 2,860.81.  To contact the reporter on this story:
