The European Commission is to seek
at least 85 billion euros ($120 billion) from the European Union
budget for transport investment between 2014 and 2020,
 Handelsblatt  reported, quoting unidentified officials at the
EU’s executive.  That’s more than the 51 billion euros earmarked for
investment in a trans-european transport network in the seven
years to 2013, the newspaper reported. The commission considers
at least 550 billion euros to be needed in total for transport
investment in that period, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
