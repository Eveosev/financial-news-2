The U.S. Financial Accounting
Standards Board may compel banks to disclose when they offer
customers below-market  interest rates  on loans to secure further
business, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified
people familiar with the matter.  The regulator will look again at the manner in which loans
and credit facilities are first recorded on a bank’s books early
next month, the newspaper said.  While banks are prohibited by law from tying credit terms
to the purchase of other products and services, they may respond
to customers’ requests, the FT said.  The proposed rules would require banks to make clear when
the transaction prices of loans differ from their fair-market
values, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
