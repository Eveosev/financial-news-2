PetroChina Co. Chief Financial
Officer Zhou Mingchun called on  China â€™s government to raise the
threshold for the windfall tax on oil and combine it with other
resource levies, the Shanghai Daily reported today.    Crude produced and sold in China is subject to a charge of
as much as 40 percent on the portion of the price above $40 a
barrel, the English-language newspaper said. The government is
studying a possible increase in the windfall trigger, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
