Turkish support for Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s governing party fell to 46.4 percent,
Haberturk said citing a poll by research company Konsensus
Arastirma.  Backing for Erdogan’s  Justice and Development Party  dropped
in the survey held between March 4 and March 10 from 49.6
percent last month, the Istanbul-based newspaper reported.
Konsensus interviewed 1,500 people by telephone in Turkey’s 81
provinces, it said. No margin of error was given.  The main opposition Republican People’s Party’s support
fell by one percentage point to 25.8 percent, while the
Nationalist Action Party scored 13.6 percent, a rise of 2.5
percentage points, the poll said. Backing for the pro-Islamic
Saadet Party also rose, it said.   The most important problem in  Turkey  is unemployment
followed by education, Konsensus said. About 69 percent of
respondents said there’s political pressure on the nation’s
press, it said.     Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
