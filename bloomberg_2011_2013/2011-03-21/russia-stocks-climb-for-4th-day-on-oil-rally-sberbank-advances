Russian stocks advanced to their
highest in more than a week as oil rose after air strikes in  Libya  threatened to prolong a disruption in supplies and
Interfax said Sberbank’s income increased last year.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks climbed 0.3 percent to
1,753.19 by the 6:45 p.m. close, its fourth day of gains and the
longest winning streak in more than two months. Oil producer OAO
Gazprom Neft jumped 3.3 percent.  OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s biggest lender, gained 0.4 percent
after Interfax reported that the company’s full-year net income
rose last year. OAO Magnit, the country’s largest supermarket
chain by market value, rallied 1.7 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index gained 1 percent to 1,981.98.  Crude, Russia’s main export earner, climbed $1.45, or 1.4
percent to $102.52 a barrel in  New York  after the air strikes in
Libya and as unrest in other parts of the region renewed concern
supplies may be disrupted. Ninety percent of Bahrain Petroleum
Co.’s employees went on strike last week in response to a police
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations, while Yemen
declared a state of emergency on March 18.  “Despite the backdrop of uncertainty affecting how
investors view opportunity and risk in developed and most
developing nations, Russia is viewed as a net beneficiary,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Uralsib Financial Corp., wrote
in an e-mailed report today.  Sberbank, which has a 12 percent weighting in the Micex,
advanced after Interfax reported profit stated in accordance
with international accounting standards climbed to 181.6 billion
rubles ($6.4 billion) last year, citing Chief Executive Officer  German Gref .  To contact the reporter on this story:
