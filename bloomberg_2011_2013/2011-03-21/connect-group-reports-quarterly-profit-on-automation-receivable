  Connect Group (CONN)  NV, the Belgian
contract maker of electronics for clients including Barco NV,
reported a quarterly profit after revaluing the payment due for
its former automation division by 400,000 euros ($568,000).  The fourth-quarter loss from continuing operations narrowed
to 91,000 euros from 1.57 million euros and includes a 1.63
million-euro provision that covers 50 percent of doubtful
receivables from two customers, the Kampenhout, Belgium-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Quarterly sales
climbed 22 percent to 37.2 million euros and the value of
outstanding orders amounted to 71.2 million euros, little
changed from the end of the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
