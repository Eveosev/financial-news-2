European jet fuel premiums shrank
as BP Plc sold barges of the fuel. Diesel also fell as Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Statoil ASA sold the product to Vitol Group.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $956 to $966 a metric ton, according
to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin
Board and Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London
time. That was more than March 18 transactions at $950 to $955 a
ton.  Shell, Gunvor International BV, North Sea Group and Cargill
Inc. bought the product from Morgan Stanley, Statoil and Chevron
Corp. Ethanol is added to the Eurobob grade to make finished
automotive fuel. The trades are typically for lots of 1,000 tons
or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , rose to $5.23
a barrel, up 11 cents from March 18, according to London-based
broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd. The spread has declined 35
percent from $8.10 on March 3.  “The tumbling European gasoline crack is particularly
worrying,” analysts at Vienna-based researcher JBC Energy said
in a note today. Volatile oil futures and “sky high” premiums
for low-sulfur crude are eroding refining margins, JBC said.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent shrank to $6.66 from $6.91 in
the previous session, according to PVM. Naphtha is used in
gasoline and petrochemical production.  Middle Distillates  Jet-fuel barge premiums decreased, trading at $86 a ton
above ICE April gasoil on London’s ICE Futures  Europe  exchange,
the Platts survey showed. That was lower than the $87 premium on
March 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BP sold the
fuel to Total SA and Shell.  Barges of ultra-low-sulfur diesel traded at $16 and $17 a
ton more than ICE April gasoil, narrowing from $17 and $19 on
March 18. Vitol was the only buyer, while Statoil, Belgomine NV
and Shell were sellers.  Gasoil for April gained 0.6 percent to $978.25 a ton as of
4:49 p.m. local time on the ICE exchange. Gasoil for May
advanced 0.7 percent to $977.25 a ton. Brent for May increased
1.3 percent to $115.35 a barrel.  The fuel’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, was
little changed from the previous session at $15.74 a barrel at
4:30 p.m.  London  time, according to ICE data. The gap widened to
a two-year high at $17.70 on Mar. 16.  European gasoil’s premium to Brent may prompt U.S. refiners
to export the fuel to Europe, potentially pressuring the
European diesel market, according to Petromatrix GmbH.  “Improvement in the ICE gasoil crack should also increase
arbitrage economics from the U.S. to Europe, which could be a
further capping factor to physical premiums for European
diesel”  Olivier Jakob , managing director of the Switzerland-
based researcher, wrote in a report today.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  rose in line with advancing crude
futures. Barge deals were struck at $600 to $605 a ton,
according to the Platts survey. That was higher than trades at
$589.25 to $591.50 in the previous session.  The low-sulfur fuel grade changed hands at $662.75 a ton,
compared with $654 on March 18.  Refinery News  BP Plc plans to halt a crude unit at its Rotterdam
refinery, Europe’s second-largest, for maintenance in September,
according to two people with knowledge of the work.  The unit will shut for three to four weeks, the people
said, declining to be identified because they’re not authorized
to speak publicly about the plans.  Robert Wine , a BP spokesman
based at company headquarters in London, declined to comment.  Separately, two processing units at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s
Fawley refinery, the U.K.’s largest, are still shut for
maintenance that began in early February, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
