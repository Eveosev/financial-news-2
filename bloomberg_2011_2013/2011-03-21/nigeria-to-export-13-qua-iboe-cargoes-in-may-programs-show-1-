  Nigeria , a favored supplier of oil
to U.S. refiners, plans to ship 13 cargoes of Qua Iboe crude in
May, unchanged from Aprilâ€™s plan, according to loading schedules
obtained by Bloomberg.  Six Bonny Light cargoes will be shipped in May, compared
with a revised plan of seven for April, the programs showed.
Shipments of both crudes are 950,000 barrels each.  Including some smaller cargoes, the country will also
export three Yoho, eight Brass River, two EA, five Erha, and six
Forcados shipments, according to the programs.  The remaining loading schedules have yet to be released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
