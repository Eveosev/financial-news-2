Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) , the biggest maker
of chips for television set-top boxes, agreed to buy closely
held Provigent for $313 million, increasing its ability to
handle wireless traffic.  The Irvine, California-based company will acquire all of
Provigentâ€™s outstanding shares of capital stock and equity
rights, it said in a statement today. The deal is expected to be
completed next quarter.  Provigent, which makes semiconductors for microwave
backhaul systems, will help Broadcom handle data as more
wireless devices use so-called fourth-generation services, or
4G. Microwave backhaul makes up more than 50 percent of systems
used to handle mobile data, Broadcom said.  Broadcom rose 84 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $40.51 at 4 p.m.
New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have
fallen 7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
