Serbia’s Novak Djokovic took over
the No. 2 spot in men’s tennis after beating top-ranked Rafael Nadal yesterday in the final of the BNP Paribas Open in  Indian
Wells ,  California .  Djokovic is undefeated so far this season after the 4-6, 6-
3, 6-2 victory over the Spaniard. The 23-year-old is 430 points
ahead of previous No. 2  Roger Federer , who holds the record for
men’s Grand Slam singles titles. Djokovic is on 8,710 points, 
trailing Nadal by 3,920 points.  The Serb earned $611,000 with the win in California, where
he beat  Switzerland ’s Federer in the semifinals, and is now 18-0
in 2011. Djokovic captured his second Australian Open title in
January and won in Dubai last month. Federer was the last person
to beat him, in the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals in
November.  Sweden’s  Robin Soderling  is ranked fourth, on 5,735 points,
