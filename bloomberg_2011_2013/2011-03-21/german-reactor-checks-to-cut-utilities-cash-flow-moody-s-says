Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s plan to
halt nuclear  power plants  for three-month safety checks at  Germany ’s seven oldest nuclear reactors will cut cash flows for
their operators, Moody’s Investors Service said.  E.ON AG, RWE AG and EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG will
lose a combined 1.6 percent of about 20 billion euros ($28.3
billion) in funds from operations they generated in 2010 as
power output falls short of plans, Niel Bisset, a senior vice
president at Moody’s, wrote in a note today. The stoppages are
“credit negative” for the companies, he said.  The utilities will seek to make up for the shortfall of
about 11 terawatt-hours, or almost 2 percent of Germany’s annual
consumption, by increasing generation at other plants or
purchasing power in the market, according to the note.  “Neither option offers any upside for the utilities,”
Bisset wrote. “In cases where such market purchases are made at
prices above the forward sale price achieved, the utility will
incur a loss; additional power produced in-house is likely to be
at a lower margin.”  German utilities set prices for electricity several years
in advance so as to limit earnings volatility.  Merkel ordered the nationwide safety review on March 15 to
run through June. E.ON, RWE and EnBW responded by halting five
reactors. Two of the remaining seven oldest plants were offline
at the time the chancellor ordered the review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
