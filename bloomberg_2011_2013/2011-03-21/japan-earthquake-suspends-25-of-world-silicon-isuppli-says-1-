The semiconductor industry faces
possible shortages of silicon after the Japan earthquake caused
suspension of 25 percent of the world’s production of the
material key to manufacturing chips, IHS iSuppli said.  Plants owned by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. and  MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc. (WFR)  are out of action for the “near term,” the El
Segundo, California-based market analysis firm said today in a
statement.  “Suspension of operations at these plants could have wide-
ranging implications beyond the Japanese electronics industry,”
iSuppli said. “A 25 percent reduction in supply could have a
major effect on worldwide semiconductor production.”  The silicon wafers produced at the plants are mainly used
by makers of memory chips, according to iSuppli.  South Korea ’s
Samsung Electronics Co. is the world’s largest maker of those
products.  Shin-Etsu said March 17 that there was damage to its
Shirakawa plant and that it is unclear how long it will take to
restore operations. The company intends to set up production
elsewhere, it said. ISuppli said that facility accounts for 20
percent of world output.  MEMC’s Utsunomiya plant had been evacuated and operations
suspended as of March 17, according to the company. That factory
produces 5 percent of world output, according to iSuppli.  All chips used in computers and other electronic devices
are produced by building up layers of chemicals and metals on
disks of silicon.  MEMC shares rose 19 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $12.50 at
12:40 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporters on this story:
