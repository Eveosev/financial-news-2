  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR) , an Indian oil
refiner and power plant operator, fell to a six-month low in
London trading because of delays in gaining approval for the
development of some domestic coal blocks.  Essar declined as much as 7 percent to 441.8 pence, the
lowest since Sept. 29, to traded at 454.2 pence as of 9:35 a.m.
local time. The stock has risen 16 percent since its initial
public offering in May last year, valuing the company at 5.9
billion pounds ($9.6 billion).  The utility is awaiting forest clearance approval for its
Mahan, Chakla and Ashok Karkata coal blocks, Essar said in a
statement today. Coal from these blocks will fuel its Mahan I
and Tori power stations, the  Port Louis , Mauritius-based company
said. A panel of government ministers is working to resolve
cases where significant progress has been made toward the
construction of new plants, Essar said.  Essar Energy also pushed back by a quarter the start of
three power plants in  India , Vice-Chairman Pranshat Ruia said on
a conference call.  The 1,200-megawatt Salaya I plant in Gujarat state has been
delayed after the monsoon interrupted construction work at the
plant, Essar Power Ltd. Chief Executive Officer K.V. B. Reddy
said on the call.  The company is liable to pay a penalty to Gujarat Urja
Vikas Nigam Ltd., which supplies electricity in the state, for
delays in supply. Essar Energy may not have to finally pay any
liability because there arenâ€™t any transmission lines to supply
Gujarat Urja the power, Reddy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
