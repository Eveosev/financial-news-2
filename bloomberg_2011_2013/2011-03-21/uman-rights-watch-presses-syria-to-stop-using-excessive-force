Syrian security forces have killed
five people and injured dozens of others since March 18 during
protests in the southern town of Daraa,  Human Rights Watch  said.  Government forces fired on demonstrators and used tear gas
to break up a public gathering in the town yesterday, HRW said
on its  website . It called on the government to stop using live
fire and excessive force against protesters.  “The government has shown no qualms about shooting dead
its own citizens for speaking out,” said Sarah Leah Whitson,
the organization’s Middle East and North Africa director.
“Syrians have shown incredible courage in daring to protest
publicly against one of the most repressive governments in the
region, and they shouldn’t have to pay with their lives.”  The rallies in Syria mark the latest extension of the
political turmoil that has engulfed the region this year.
Uprisings have toppled the presidents of Tunisia and  Egypt  and
threatened the rule of  Muammar Qaddafi  in  Libya , where United
Nations-backed international forces have started air strikes to
protect civilian protesters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
