House Democratic leader  Nancy Pelosi  was released from a Rome hospital after a brief stay and
is resuming her schedule in Italy, her office confirmed today.  “After several flights yesterday in Afghanistan, and a
long flight back to Italy that arrived early this morning,
Leader Pelosi was not feeling well,” her spokesman, Nadeam
Elshami, said in an e-mailed statement. “This morning in Rome,
the leader was advised to visit a clinic, and the closest
medical facility was a hospital.”  Pelosi, a California Democrat, is on an official trip to
Rome with a congressional delegation that included a weekend
meeting in Afghanistan with President Hamid Karzai.  Pelosi, 70, was taken to the Policlinico Umberto I in
central Rome today and was forced to cancel a meeting with
Italian Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa.  “The leader is now resuming her schedule in  Italy ,”
Elshami said.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Andrew Davis  in Rome at
