PGE SA, Polandâ€™s largest power
utility, said 2010 net income without minorities declined to
3.01 billion zloty ($1.06 billion) from 3.37 billion zloty a
year earlier. That compares with the 2.99 billion-zloty mean
estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Last month the company said in a preliminary statement that
its 2010 net income would reach 3.01 billion zloty.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
