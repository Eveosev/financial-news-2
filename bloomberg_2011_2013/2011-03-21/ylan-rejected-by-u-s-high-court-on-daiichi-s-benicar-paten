The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive Mylan Inc.’s challenge to a patent that lets  Daiichi
Sankyo  Co. ward off competition to its hypertension drugs
Benicar and Azor.  The justices today left intact a lower court ruling that
upheld the validity of the patent, which shields the medicine
from competition until October 2016. Mylan, which is based in
Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, was aiming to sell generic versions of
the drugs.  The case is Mylan v. Daiichi Sankyo, 10-770.  To contact the reporter on this story:
