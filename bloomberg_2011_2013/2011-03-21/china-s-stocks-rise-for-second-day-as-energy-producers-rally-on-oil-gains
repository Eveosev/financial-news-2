  China ’s benchmark stock-index rose
as energy companies gained on higher  oil prices , outweighing
declines by copper producers amid concern tightening measures
will slow economic growth.  PetroChina Co. and China Coal Energy Co. climbed as crude
futures jumped after the U.S., U.K. and  France  launched
airstrikes at targets in  Libya . Dongfang Electric Corp. led a
rebound for power-equipment stocks after Citigroup Inc. cited
the company as saying nuclear-equipment sales this year will be
intact. Jiangxi Copper Co., the biggest copper producer, slid to
the lowest in a month after the central bank ordered banks to
set aside more cash for a third time this year to slow inflation.  “The reserve-requirement move is within expectations,”
said Wu Kan, a  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “In the short term, there probably won’t
be any further tightening measures and that’ll spur a rally
after last week’s drop.”  The Shanghai Composite Index added 2.25, or 0.1 percent, to
2,909.14 at the 3 p.m. close, after changing direction more than
10 times. About five stocks fell for every four that rose. The
gauge trades at 13.7 times estimated earnings, compared with
around 16 times at the end of last year. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) 
slipped 0.3 percent to 3,207.11 today.  The Shanghai Composite has gained 3.6 percent this year on
optimism the world’s second-biggest economy will withstand
tighter monetary policies. Besides boosting reserve requirements,
the central bank has raised interest rates three times since the
start of 2010 to cool inflation that reached 4.9 percent in
February, exceeding the government’s 4 percent annual target.    Crude Oil   PetroChina, the nation’s biggest oil producer, added 1.6
percent to 11.75 yuan. PetroChina and Saudi Arabian Oil Co.,
known as Aramco, agreed to build a refinery in Yunnan province,
the state oil company of  Saudi Arabia  said yesterday.  China Coal, the nation’s second-largest coal producer,
climbed 0.5 percent to 11.25 yuan. Shanxi Coking Co., the
largest publicly traded coke producer in China, gained 2.2
percent to 10.28 yuan.  Crude oil for April delivery gained as much as $2.28, or
2.3 percent to $103.35 a barrel in after-hours trading in  New
York  today. Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  vowed to repel two
days of attacks by missiles and warplanes against military
installations.  Libya holds the largest proven oil reserves in  Africa , with
44.3 billion barrels in 2009, the BP Statistical Review of World
Energy shows. The nation’s crude output has fallen to a quarter
of the production before the crisis, and may stop, according to
the chairman of the national  oil company . Bahrain Petroleum Co.
employees went on strike last week in response to a police
crackdown on anti-government demonstrations, while Yemen
declared a state of emergency.  ‘Largely Intact’  Dongfang Electric, which derived 6.5 percent of sales from
nuclear power-related products in 2009, added 1.2 percent to
29.23 yuan. The company said in a March 18 conference call
revenue from its nuclear-equipment sales in 2011-2012 will be
“largely intact,” Pierre Lau and Maggie Mok, analysts at
Citigroup, said in a note to clients.  The stock slumped 15 percent last week after the Chinese
government announced it would suspend approvals of all new
nuclear projects after the Japanese radiation leakage.
Progress is being made in restoring power to the No. 1 and
No. 2 reactors at the Fukushima nuclear complex, the Japanese
government said today.    Shanghai  Electric Group Co., a manufacturer of nuclear-
power equipment, added 1.5 percent to 8.13 yuan after sliding
9.4 percent last week.  Reserve Requirement  The People’s Bank of China said March 18 after the market
close that banks’ reserve requirements will increase half a
percentage point. The move may lock up about 350 billion yuan
($53 billion), according to Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, slid
0.8 percent to 38.93 yuan, the lowest since Feb. 11. Tongling
Nonferrous Metals Group Co., the second largest, fell 1 percent
to 28.16 yuan.  Copper for June-delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 0.7 percent to 71,310 yuan a metric ton. Futures
on the Comex in New York dropped for a second day, losing as
much as 0.3 percent to $4.325 a pound.  A gauge of financial stocks in the CSI 300 rose 0.3 percent
today, the most among the 10 industry groups. China Merchants
Bank Co. advanced 1 percent to 13.55 yuan. Poly Real Estate
Group Co., China’s second-largest developer by market value,
rose 1 percent to 12.79 yuan.  “The increase in the reserve ratio probably weakened
expectations  interest rates  will rise, supporting property
stocks,” said Zhao Duo, an analyst at Sealand Securities Co. in
Shenzhen.  Trailing Estimates  Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s biggest producer of baijiu
liquor by market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 187.13 yuan, the
biggest decline since Jan. 24. Net income for 2010 gained 17
percent to 5.05 billion yuan. That compared with the average 5.2
billion yuan of 11 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Profit margins were squeezed by rising competition and higher
raw material costs. Rival Wuliangye Yibin Co. slid 1.8 percent
to 32.40 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Jianguo Jiang in Shanghai.
