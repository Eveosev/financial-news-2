Chilean inflation-linked interest-
rate swap yields may rise following last week’s surprise 50
basis point increase by the central bank, according to BNP
Paribas SA.  Sao Paulo-based strategist  Diego Donadio  recommended paying
five-year inflation-linked swaps, betting that the rate rises to
3 percent from 2.25 percent today.  The central bank is set “to promote a much faster than
expected normalization of real rates,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
