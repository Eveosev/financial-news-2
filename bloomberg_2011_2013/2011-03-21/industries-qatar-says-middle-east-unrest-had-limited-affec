Industries Qatar, the Persian Gulf
country’s petrochemical, fertilizer and steel manufacturer, said
that unrest in the Middle East and North Africa has “limited
impact” on its business.  Petrochemical “volumes originally destined for affected
Middle East and North African customers, were diverted to
alternative  Far East  Asian and Latin American buyers,” the
company’s Chief Coordinator Abdulrahman Ahmad Al-Shaibi said in
a statement today. The company’s steel arm continues to receive
pellets from Bahrain that are used in manufacturing.  Civil unrest that brought down leaders in Tunisia and Egypt
earlier this year has spread to Libya, Bahrain, Yemen, Oman,
Algeria, Morocco,  Saudi Arabia , Jordan and Syria. Industries
Qatar’s petrochemical arm suspended operations of a warehouse in
Egypt in the first quarter, Al-Shaibi said. The warehouse is now
operating as normal.  A 9-magnitude earthquake on March 11 in Japan isn’t
expected to have a “material impact” on exports to the Far
East, Al-Shaibi said. “It is likely to lead to further
tightening of global ethylene and polyethylene markets,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Robert Tuttle  in Doha at
