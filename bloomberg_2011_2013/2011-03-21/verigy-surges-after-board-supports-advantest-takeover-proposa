Verigy Ltd. (VRGY) , a maker of chip-
testing equipment that’s weighing a takeover proposal versus a
merger, rose the most in more than three months on the Nasdaq
after the board said it prefers to be bought by  Advantest Corp. (6857)   Advantest’s December bid of $15 a share in cash is a
“superior offer,” to the agreement Verigy signed with rival LTX-
Credence Corp., Verigy’s board said today in a statement.  LTX-Credence, based in Milpitas,  California , has until the
close of business on March 25 to make a counter offer, Verigy
said. The company agreed in November to an all-stock merger with
LTX-Credence. Verigy would owe LTX-Credence $15 million if that
deal doesn’t go through, according to a March 4 regulatory
filing.  There’s no guarantee the transaction with Advantest will be
completed because Verigy’s board doesn’t have the unilateral
right to terminate the agreement with LTX-Credence, Verigy said.
Instead, Verigy’s board of directors will ask shareholders to
reject that deal.  Verigy, based in  Singapore  and with offices in Cupertino,
California, climbed $1.31, or 10 percent, to $14.06 at 4 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the most since Dec. 6.
LTX-Credence fell 19 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $8.26. U.S.-
traded shares of Tokyo-based Advantest gained 60 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $17.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
