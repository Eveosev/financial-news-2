The  Bank of England ’s steps to put
more five-pound ($8) notes in circulation may create a
“virtuous circle” by removing more soiled bills from use, said
Victoria Cleland, head of the central bank’s notes division.  The bank expects 4 billion pounds of “good-quality” five-
pound notes to enter circulation in 2012, almost twice as many
as last year, Cleland said in a speech today in  Barcelona ,  Spain . Their current scarcity means each bill is assessed for
its fitness to be in use about twice a year, compared with nine
times for a 10-pound note.  Improving the quality of five-pound notes in use will boost
Britons’ confidence in their ability to transact in cash,
Cleland said. The bank has worked with ATM operators to
encourage them to provide more of the notes, and the biggest of
these have agreed to ensure 1.2 percent of cash they dispense is
in the notes.  “All players in the cash cycle share a responsibility for
ensuring that notes function as an efficient means of payment,”
Cleland said. “Achieving an appropriate denominational mix of
cash acquisition by the public is an essential part of this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
