  Royal Mail  Group Ltd. is to cut up
to 3,451 jobs across its operations, with as many as 1,000
operational line managers’ jobs to be eliminated through
“voluntary means,” it said in an e-mailed statement.  After a review of managers in head office departments,
1,700 employees will be leaving and, separately, about 751
London jobs will be cut, amid a reorganization and
“modernization” program, the statement said.  Royal Mail said in the statement it “believes it will not
have to resort to compulsory redundancies,” and a spokesman
said by telephone that “the vast majority” of the 1,700 head
office managers “have already left.”  The Communications Workers Union said in an e-mailed
statement that Royal Mail’s plans for its London mail centres
can’t be implemented without compulsory redundancies, and the
company is in breach of existing agreements it has with the
union. The Union is “insisting that Royal Mail returns to
talks,” it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
