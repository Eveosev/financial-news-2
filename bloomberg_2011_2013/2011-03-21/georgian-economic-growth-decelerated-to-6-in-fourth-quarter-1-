  Georgia ’s economic growth slowed in
the fourth quarter to an annual 6 percent from 6.7 percent in
the previous three months, the statistics office said.  Gross domestic product gained an annual 6.4 percent for all
of 2010 after shrinking a revised 3.8 percent in the previous
year, the Tbilisi-based office said today in an e-mailed
statement. The central bank predicts the former Soviet
republic’s economy will grow 5.5 percent this year.  “I know people today are worried about lower investments,
inflation, jobs,” Prime Minister Nika Gilauri told reporters
today. “But the economy grew 6.4 percent, which I think is a
good answer to those who are worried about Georgia’s economy.”  The country’s $12.2 billion economy is recovering after
suffering about $1 billion in damage when the Black Sea nation’s
army was routed by Russia in the war over the breakaway region
of South Ossetia in 2008. Policy makers have increased the key
refinancing rate five times since June by a total of 3
percentage points to 8 percent to contain price growth.  The regulator last lifted borrowing costs on Feb. 16 by a
half a point after the inflation rate rose to 12.3 percent in
January, the highest since August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
