Goldman Sachs raised its forecast
for  Argentina ’s economic growth in 2011 after the economy
expanded last year at the fastest pace since 2005.  Goldman Sachs economist  Alberto Ramos  raised his gross
domestic product expansion estimate to 6.8 percent from a
previous 5.6 percent, according to an e-mail statement. Still,
he expects a “significant slowdown” in the second half of
2011, and maintained his 2012 growth forecast of 3.2 percent.  South America ’s second-biggest economy expanded for an
eighth consecutive year in 2010, growing 9.2 percent. The
country’s recovery from 0.9 percent expansion in 2009 was fueled
by commodity prices and by external demand, mainly from  Brazil ,
for manufactured and industrial goods, Ramos said.  Ramos forecast that prices will rise by more than 25
percent this year. Even so, the government is unlikely to take
steps to rein in inflation, he said.  “The paramount policy objective appears to be to maximize
growth ahead of the elections, even if such a strategy proves
unsustainable and thereby self-defeating over the medium term,”
said New York-based Ramos in the statement.  The government will allow the peso to depreciate gradually
until the October presidential elections as it tries to prevent
a further escalation of inflationary pressures, said Ramos, who
estimated the peso will lose 8 percent to 10 percent of its
value over the whole of 2011.  The resulting appreciation of the real  exchange rate  means
that “beyond entrenched high inflation, the erosion of external
competitiveness is another thorny issue the next administration
will have to face, which, if not handled properly could end up
generating a crash, rather than a soft-landing of the economy in
2012,” said Ramos.  The peso, which last year fell 4.5 percent, the most among
Latin America’s major currencies, was little changed as of 4:22
p.m. New York time at 4.0366 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
