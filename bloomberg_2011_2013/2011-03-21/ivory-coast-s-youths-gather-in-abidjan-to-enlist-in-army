Thousands of youths gathered in
front of the headquarters of  Ivory Coast ’s armed forces after
incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  called on people to join the
army amid mounting clashes with supporters of rival  Alassane Ouattara .  “I came to enrol because I want to save my country,” Marc
Ouraga, 19, said at the headquarters in the commercial capital,
Abidjan, today. “I would be proud to die for Ivory Coast. I’m
tired of the humiliation coming from the United Nations and the
rebels.”  The line at the only place in the country to enlist in the
military stretched for about 500 meters (1,640 feet).  On March 19, Charles Ble Goude, the leader of Young
Patriots youth militia, called on people to enlist in the army
that remains loyal to Gbagbo, Abidjan-based Soir-Info newspaper
reported today.  Gbagbo refuses to hand power to Ouattara, the
internationally recognized winner of a disputed Nov. 28
presidential election.  To contact the reporters on this story:
