The following is a roundup of
soccer stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the
Web.  Terry’s Return  Peter Shilton,  England ’s most-capped player, supports  John Terry ’s return as national team captain,  the Sun  reported.  Terry will lead England against  Wales  on March 26 in a Euro
2012 qualifier, the Sun said.  He lost the captaincy to  Rio Ferdinand  last year after
tabloid newspaper stories that he had an affair with former
teammate Wayne Bridge’s ex-girlfriend.  Terry is a “natural leader” and “hasn’t broken any
laws,” Shilton was quoted as saying.  Carroll to Start  Andy Carroll must prove he’s “100 percent” fit to start
for England against Wales after playing 72 minutes for Liverpool
in the win at Sunderland yesterday,  the Sun  reported.  Wolves winger Matthew Jarvis, called up for the first time
yesterday, is unlikely to play in Cardiff, according to the
newspaper.  United Gets Saint    Manchester United  has beaten Arsenal in the race to sign
Southampton’s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, the  Daily Mirror 
reported.  United will offer 10 million pounds ($16.2 million) for the
17-year-old, which would be a record transfer fee for a
teenager, according to the Mirror.  Lehmann Unprepared  Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger says goalkeeper Jens Lehmann
isn’t ready for a return to first-team action, the  Daily Mail 
reported.  The 41-year-old is short of match practice after not
playing since May last year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
