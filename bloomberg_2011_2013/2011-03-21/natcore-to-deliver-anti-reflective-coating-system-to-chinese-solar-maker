Natcore Technology Inc. (NXT) , a  Red
Bank , New Jersey-based solar energy technology company, will
deliver its first anti-reflective coating system for testing by
the Chinese cell maker Hunan TLNZ Solar Technology Co.  Hunan TLNZ, of Xiangtan, China, is expected to purchase the
system if the tests go well, Natcore said today in a statement.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  “If it works they’ll buy that one and buy two or three
more,” Natcore Chief Executive Officer Chuck Provini said in an
interview today. “We have begun speaking with several other
companies in China,” he said.  Natcore said March 15 that  MicroTech Process Inc.  of
Fremont, California, is building the coating systems, which will
take eight to 10 weeks to produce.  Natcore’s liquid phase deposition  technology , licensed from
 Rice University , uses a proprietary mixture of chemicals to
create a layer of silicon dioxide on solar cells at room
temperature. The company says this is less costly than other
systems that require high-temperature vacuum furnaces to create
an anti-reflective layer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
