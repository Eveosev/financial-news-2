Platina Partners LLP and D.K.
WindSupply Ltd. today opened a 170-million-euro ($241 million)
wind farm in Cyprus, Platina said in an e-mailed statement.  The 82-megawatt project in Orites, southwest Cyprus, is
equivalent to 8 percent of the island’s electricity generation
capacity, the private equity fund manager said today. The
project, using 41 Vestas Wind Systems A/S turbines, will get a
20-year fixed-rate subsidy, according to the statement.  The farm is the first in Cyprus as the country strives to
meet a goal of building 300 megawatts of wind energy capacity by
2020, Platina said. Work has begun on other farms including the
42-megawatt Klavida Village, 31.5-megawatt Alexigros and 20-
megawatt Aghia Anna sites, Platina said.  “The government of Cyprus is to be applauded for its role
in facilitating the project,” Thomas Rottner, managing partner
at London-based Platina, said in the statement. “By
establishing a clear tariff regime, it has made it possible for
us to invest with confidence.”  The  European Investment Bank  provided half of the project’s
debt financing, with contributions also from  Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  ING
Groep NV (INGA)  and Norddeutsche Landesbank, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
