Saudi Arabian security forces
arrested 89 Shiite Muslims in the Eastern Province last week, an
activist said.  The people were detained on March 16, 17 and 18, Ahmed al-
Mushaikhes said in a telephone interview today. Protests took
place in several Shiite villages and towns on those days.  Shiite communities, a minority in the Sunni-ruled kingdom,
have been holding regular rallies in recent weeks, with
demonstrators calling for the release of nine Shiites jailed
since 1996. Earlier this month, 22 Shiite protesters were
briefly detained.  Al-Mushaikhes said he visited several detainees today.
“Some told me they had participated in the protests. Others
said they were just onlookers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
