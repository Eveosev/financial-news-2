  Regus Plc (RGU) , the world’s largest
operator of serviced offices, reported a 98 percent decline in
full-year profit as small businesses in  Europe  reduced their
demand for space and an expansion program lifted expenses. The
shares gained after Regus increased its dividend.  Net income fell to 1.5 million pounds ($2 million) from 67
million pounds a year earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said
today in a statement. Regus raised the annual dividend by 8
percent to 2.6 pence a share after the profit margin at its
older business centers widened.  Small and medium-sized companies in Europe cut back on
office space because of the uncertain economic prospects,
lowering occupancy rates. To attract customers, Regus cut prices
and offered greater incentives, while its expenses rose as it
opened new centers to expand its network to more than 1,100
office centers in 87 countries.  “The improvement in the mature center margin is a sign
that things are moving in the right direction,” said Hector Forsythe, an analyst at Oriel Securities with an “add”
recommendation on the shares.  Regus rose as much as 9.9 percent to 110.4 pence in  London ,
lifting the company’s market value to 1.04 billion pounds. The
stock climbed 23 percent in the three months through March 18,
while the FTSE All-Share Support Services Index of 53 shares was
little changed.  Wider Margin  The company said the profit margin at office buildings
opened before 2009, which have higher occupancy levels because
they have been established for longer, increased by 1.2
percentage points in the second half.  Regus added 125 centers with 20,122 new workstations last
year, primarily in  Brazil ,  China , the U.K. and U.S., at a cost
of 69.7 million pounds. At the end of 2010, the company had net
cash of 192 million pounds, allowing it to open in locations in
Oman, Ghana and  Lithuania .  The expansion and opening of centers increased leasing
costs by 2 percent to 836.4 million pounds. Regus’s own
administrative expenses rose by almost 18 percent to 197.3
million pounds as a result of the expansion and because of costs
linked to an electronic management program.  Average revenue per available workstation fell 0.8 percent
to 6,168 pounds in the six months to Dec. 31. Occupancy
increased to 76.9 percent from 75.9 percent six months earlier,
although in the European and U.K. divisions it fell.  Revenue declined 1.4 percent to 1.04 billion pounds. In the
U.K., where a fifth of Regus’s workstations are located, revenue
dropped 6.5 percent to 179.8 million pounds. Regus booked a 15.8
million-pound charge in the first half to cover the costs of a
reorganization of its U.K. arm.  Regus renegotiated leases and closed three centers, which
will help cut costs by 15 million pounds annually. The company
said it’s “confident” that the arm will report an operating
profit in 2011 after a 12.2 million-pound loss last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
