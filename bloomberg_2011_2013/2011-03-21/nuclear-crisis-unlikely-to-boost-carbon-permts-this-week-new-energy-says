The crisis at the Fukushima nuclear
plant in  Japan  and reaction in  Germany  probably will fail to
drive carbon prices higher this week after last week’s gains,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  December carbon may fall to 16.50 euros ($23.38) a metric
ton as buyers lock in profits made last week, analysts including
Konrad Hanschmidt in  London  said today in an e-mailed note.  “The details of the German nuclear moratorium, due to be
announced tomorrow, are expected merely to confirm the previous
statements and are therefore unlikely to cause any new market
rallies,” the analysts said. Prices may rise as high as 17.50
euros this week, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
