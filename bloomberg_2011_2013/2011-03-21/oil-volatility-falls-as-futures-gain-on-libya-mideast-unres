Oil options volatility fell as the
underlying futures prices gained on concern that allied
airstrikes on  Libya  and political violence in Yemen and  Syria 
will cause supply shortages.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 35.5 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 37.6 percent on March 18.  “The volatility on these options is in quite a bit,” said
Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in New
York and a trader at the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
“Premiums are coming off.”  Oil for April delivery gained $1.26 to settle at $102.33 a
barrel on the Nymex. The April contract expires tomorrow. The
more actively traded May contract rose $1.24 to $103.09.  May $100 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 1,475 lots changing hands as of 3:40 p.m. in
New York. They fell 84 cents to $2.36 a barrel. May $95 puts,
the next most active contract with 1,222 contracts trading, lost
54 cents to 86 cents a barrel. One contract covers 1,000 barrels
of oil.  “ There was also very good selling in May $110, $115 and
$120 calls early in the day,” Rigolini said.  May $120 calls dropped 12 cents to 46 cents on volume of
922 contracts in electronic trading on the Nymex.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $80 puts were the most active options traded March 18,
with 17,447 lots changing hands. They fell 4 cents to 8 cents a
barrel. The next most active option, May $95 puts, dropped 18
cents to $1.40 a barrel on 7,809 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 40,056
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 39,840 and
December $120 calls with 38,877.  To contact the reporters on this story:
