  Infigen Energy (IFN) , an Australian
developer of renewable energy projects, agreed to buy the stakes
in four planned wind energy projects that it doesn’t already own
from  National Power Partners .  Infigen paid about A$1.4 million ($1.4 million) to National
Power to cover development costs at the projects, Infigen said
today in a statement.  National Power, a closely held clean-energy project builder
with offices in  San Francisco  and Sydney, in turn bought
Infigen’s interests in the planned 54-megawatt Glen Innes plant
in New South Wales and about 100 megawatts of other proposed
ventures previously earmarked for joint development.  The assets that Infigen bought include two in New South
Wales -- the 120-megawatt Flyers Creek site and the Bodangora
venture that will have between 70 and 100 megawatts of capacity.
The other two are the Cherry Tree wind farm in Victoria that
will have between 35 and 50 megawatts of capacity and the
Woakwine project in  South Australia , with as much as 540
megawatts.  The two companies will continue to hold a 32 percent stake
each in the Walkaway 2 and 3 wind farm projects in  Western
Australia , with combined proposed capacity of 394 megawatts,
Infigen said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
