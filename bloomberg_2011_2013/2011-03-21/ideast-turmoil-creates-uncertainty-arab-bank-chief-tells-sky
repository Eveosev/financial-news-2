Arab Bankers Association Chief
Executive Officer George Kanaan told Sky News in an interview
the turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has created an
environment of “great uncertainty” in which banks can no
longer “function properly.”  The political unrest in Bahrain will end the country’s
aspirations of becoming a regional financial center, and its
hopes “are now difficult to achieve,” Kanaan said. The Gulf
state now risks seeing its financial institutions decamping to
neighboring locations that offer more stability, and “Bahrain’s
problems are to Dubai’s advantage,” Kanaan said in the
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
