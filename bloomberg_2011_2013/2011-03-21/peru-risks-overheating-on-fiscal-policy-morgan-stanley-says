Peru’s economy, which expanded 10
percent in January from a year earlier, is in danger of
overheating because of a “lax” fiscal policy that may force
the central bank to raise rates more than forecast, Morgan
Stanley said.  Peru’s fiscal stimulus spending has “super-charged” the
economy’s expansion, the bank said today in an e-mailed report
to clients. Government measures to rein in public outlays
haven’t had a significant effect and capital expenditures remain
in deeply stimulative territory, the bank said.  Policy makers may raise the benchmark rate to 5.5 percent
in 2011, up from a previous forecast of 4 percent as growth
risks fueling inflation, Morgan Stanley said.  At its March 10 meeting, the central bank raised the rate
by a quarter-point to 3.75 percent, its eighth increase in 11
meetings.  The sol fell 0.5 percent today to 2.7827 per dollar from
2.7680 on March 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
