  North Sea  Forties crude fell after
Royal Dutch Shell Plc sought to sell two shipments at lower
prices without success. The premium for Nigerian Qua Iboe crude
to benchmark Dated Brent reached a 32-month high.  North Sea  Shell failed to sell two cargoes of Forties. One was
offered at a discount of 20 cents to benchmark Dated Brent for
loading April 2 to April 4, and the other at parity to Dated
Brent for April 7 to April 9, according to a survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the daily Platts trading window. This
compares with a premium of 10 cents for a shipment Shell sold
March 18.  Trafigura Beheer BV was unable to sell a cargo of Forties
for April 3 to April 5 at 50 cents below the cash cost of North
Sea crudes for May, while ConocoPhillips sought to buy a
shipment for April 8 to April 10 at parity to Dated Brent
without success, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in  London . Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 3 cents
more than Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 20 cents March
18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement traded at $115.44 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the
window, up from $114.24 March 18. The June contract was at
$115.36, 8 cents below May.  Shell sold 100,000 metric tons of Russian Urals for March
31 to April 4 delivery to Rotterdam to Glencore International AG
at $4.10 below Dated Brent, compared with a discount of $3.50
for the last trade March 15, the survey showed.  Prior to the window, Urals in northwest  Europe  fell 5 cents
to $3.63 below Dated Brent today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached a 31-month low at a discount of $3.78 on
March 14.  Mediterranean  Gunvor International BV failed to sell 80,000 tons of Urals
for April 2 to April 6 in the Mediterranean at $3.30 below Dated
Brent, the survey showed. This compared with a discount of $2.75
for the last transaction done March 18.  West Africa  Nigeria plans to ship 13 cargoes of Qua Iboe crude in May,
unchanged from April’s plan, according to loading schedules
obtained by Bloomberg.  The country will also export six Bonny Light, three Yoho,
eight Brass River, two EA, five Erha, and six Forcados
shipments, according to programs obtained by Bloomberg. Some of
those cargoes are of a smaller size than in the Qua Iboe
program. Traders expect loading programs for other Nigerian
crudes later this week.  Qua Iboe crude was assessed at a premium of $3.97 a barrel
over Dated Brent today, the highest level for the grade since
July 22, 2008, according to Bloomberg data. Refiners are turning
to West African crude as an alternative to Libyan supplies that
they are no longer able to buy because of the country’s civil
war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
