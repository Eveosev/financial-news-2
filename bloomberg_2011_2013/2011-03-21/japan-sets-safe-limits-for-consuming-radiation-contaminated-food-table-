  Japan ’s  Ministry of Health, Labor
and Welfare  has set safe limits for radiation in various
products for human consumption.  Authorities have heightened monitoring for contamination
following the emission of radioactive material from Tokyo
Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant
since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Radiation in food is
measured in Becquerel, a gauge of the strength of radioactivity
in materials such as  Iodine-131  and  Cesium-137 .  The prescribed safe limit for I-131 in vegetables is set at
2,000 Becquerel (Bq) per kilogram and 500 Bq/kg for radioactive
cesium.  The highest reading reported on the health ministry’s
website so far has come from a sample of  spinach  collected on
March 18 from Hitachi city, 97 kilometers (60 miles) south of
the plant. The spinach, which didn’t enter the food chain,
contained 27 times the safe limit of radiation for I-131,
according to the health ministry.  The spinach contained 54,100 Bq/kg of I-131 and 1,931 Bq/kg
of cesium. That means consuming 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of fresh
spinach would yield a radiation exposure of 1.2 millisieverts,
or half the average annual natural exposure from soil and cosmic
rays, based on Bloomberg calculations using a formula posted on
the website of Japan’s  Food Safety Commission .  Japan’s health ministry advises that materials exceeding
100 Becquerel per kilogram shouldn’t be used as the basis for
powered infant milk formula.  To contact the reporter on this story:
