Bets on a stronger Swiss franc, at
a seven-year high, reflect the currency’s status as a refuge
after a magintude-9.0 earthquake struck Japan, according to  RBC
Capital Markets .  “The Swiss franc does still trade as a safe haven,” said  Adam Cole , global head of foreign-exchange strategy in London.
“Given the event risk at the time was Japan-specific, that
probably funneled safe-haven flows into the franc not the yen.”  Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show hedge funds
and other large speculators boosted bets on a rise for the franc
against the dollar compared with those on a decline to 27,640,
the most since December 2004. The data, published on March 18,
is for positions as of March 15.  The franc weakened against all of its 16 most traded
counterparts but the yen today, as Japan made progress in
cooling a nuclear power-plant damaged by the March 11 quake. The
currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 90.53 centimes per dollar as
of 12:19 a.m. in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
