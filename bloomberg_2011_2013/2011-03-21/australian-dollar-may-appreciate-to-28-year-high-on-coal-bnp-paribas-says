  Australia ’s dollar may surpass its
highest level since it became free floating in 1983, boosted by
rising commodity prices including coal, BNP Paribas SA said.  “Australia is the globe’s biggest coal producer and rising
coal prices provide another positive term of trade effect, which
will boost local income and asset prices,” analysts led by  Hans-Guenter Redeker , London-based global head of foreign-
exchange strategy, wrote in an investor report today. The
Australian dollar may strengthen to $1.04, they wrote.  The so-called Aussie dollar reached $1.0256, the highest
since the currency was freely floated in 1983, on Dec. 31. It
climbed 1 percent to $1.0056 as of 1:49 p.m. in London.  Benchmark European coal derivatives for next-year delivery
advanced 8.6 percent since December to $130.60 a ton, and
climbed to as high as $134.40 on March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
