European Union Financial Services
Commissioner  Michel Barnier  said some bankers haven’t heard
“the calls for moderation” on bonuses and “haven’t
understood” the importance of the issue, the FT reported,
citing an interview.  The application of new EU-wide rules governing bankers’
bonuses “hasn’t been adequate,” Barnier also said, the FT
reported. Barnier plans to address the issue, firstly, through
the EU, which will be studying whether the new rules were
applied correctly, and secondly, through  France ’s presidency of
the Group of 20 leading economies, where Barnier said he intends
to “pose questions to finance ministers,” according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
