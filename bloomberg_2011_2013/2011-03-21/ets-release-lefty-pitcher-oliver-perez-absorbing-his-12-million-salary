The  New York Mets  cut pitcher
Oliver Perez, swallowing the former 15-game winner’s $12 million
salary for the 2011 season.  Perez’s release was confirmed in an e-mail from Jay
Horwitz, a spokesman for the Mets.  Perez, 29, had a combined 3-9 record over the past two
seasons since signing a three-year, $36 million contract in
February 2009. Coupled with last week’s release of second-
baseman Luis Castillo, who had $6 million left on his contract,
the Mets will be paying $18 million to two players who won’t be
on their roster.  Perez had season-ending knee surgery in August 2009 after
posting a 3-4 record with a 6.82 earned run average in 14
starts, missing most of May and June because of the injured
knee. He had an 8.38 earned run average over 9 2/3 innings in
spring training.  He returned last season and went 0-3 in seven starts before
losing his place in the rotation. He was later placed on the 15-
day disabled list with tendonitis in his right knee, missing
June and much of July. Perez ended the season with a 0-5 record
and a 6.80 ERA.  For his nine-year career with the Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates
and  San Diego Padres , Perez has a 58-69 record and a 4.63 earned
run average. He was 29-29 in  New York , with his best season
coming in 2007, when he went 15-10 with a 3.56 ERA.  The $18 million hit to the Mets’ payroll from payments owed
to Perez and Castillo comes as the team has said it is reining
in costs. The Wilpon family is trying to keep control of the
franchise while fighting a lawsuit tied to the  Ponzi scheme 
created by Bernard L. Madoff.  Trustee Irving Picard wants to recover as much as $1
billion in principal and alleged phony profits made by Sterling
Equities Inc., which owns the Mets.  Fred Wilpon  in January said
he is looking to sell up to 25 percent of the franchise to raise
money.  Wilpon and another owner, Saul Katz, said in a news release
yesterday that Picard’s allegations weren’t true.  To contact the reporter on this story:
