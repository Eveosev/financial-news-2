The  Scottish government  named the
Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors as the preferred bidder for
the new Firth of Forth river crossing north of Edinburgh.  The bid of 790 million pounds ($1.29 billion) for the
design and build contract is below the initial estimate of
between 900 million pounds and 1.2 billion pounds, the
government said in an e-mailed statement today.  The group consists of Dragados, a unit of Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA, American Bridge Co.,  Hochtief AG (HOT) 
and  Galliford Try Plc (GFRD) â€™s Morrison Construction unit.  Work on the 2.7 kilometer (1.7 million) twin-span, cable-
stayed road crossing is due to start later this year and
completed in 2016. The total costs of as much as 1.62 billion
pounds, including taxes and approach roads and allowing for
inflation, is less than the original estimate of as much as 2.3
billion pounds, the government said.  The existing Forth Road Bridge, which was the fourth
longest in the world when it opened in 1964, may have to close
to some traffic by 2017 because of deterioration in the main
suspension cables. It will continue to be the main crossing for
buses, taxis and cyclists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
