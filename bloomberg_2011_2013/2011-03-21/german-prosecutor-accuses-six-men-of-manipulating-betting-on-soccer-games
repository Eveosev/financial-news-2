Six men were accused of fixing
soccer matches, including World Cup qualification and European
Champions League games, on the first day of a trial in Bochum,  Germany .  The betting ring manipulated 48 soccer matches between
August 2008 and November 2009 in Germany, Switzerland, Austria,
Belgium, Liechtenstein, Denmark,  Canada  and some south-eastern
European countries, prosecutor Matthias Rohde told judges today.  The matches included a World Cup qualification game between
Liechtenstein and Finland and VSC Debrecen’s Champions League
game against AC Firenze. The ring made a profit of 3.5 million
euros ($4.96 million) while betting 32 million euros with a
single account at British bookmaker Samvo Ltd., according to
Rohde. The defendants used  Samvo  to place bets in eastern  Asia 
while they also operated in other betting companies in  Europe .  “This case may go over many months I fear,” said
Alexander Hornung, a lawyer for Croatian defendant Marijo
Cvrtac.  Some of the defendants have been in pretrial detention for
as long as 16 months. Lawyers for five of the six defendants
told the court that their clients will make use of their right
to remain silent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
