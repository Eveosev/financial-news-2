Zambia invited investors to bid for
contracts to explore for oil and gas after the government
approved a new law governing the industry, said the Ministry of
Mines and Minerals.  As many as 22 blocks are available for prospecting around
the country, according to a statement published in the state-
owned Daily Mail today. Thirteen blocks have already been
awarded to local and international companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
