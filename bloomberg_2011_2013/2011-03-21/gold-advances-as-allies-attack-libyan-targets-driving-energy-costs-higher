Gold climbed for a fourth straight
session, touching the highest price in more than a week, after
air strikes in  Libya  boosted investor demand for the precious
metal as an investment haven.  Allied officials said two days of missile and aircraft
strikes have effectively grounded Muammar Qaddafi’s air force.
The Libyan leader denounced the coalition mounting the attacks,
which includes the U.S., the U.K. and France, as “the party of
Satan.” Yemen’s President Ali Abdullah Saleh fired his cabinet
yesterday and faced a growing internal revolt.  “The gold market is reacting to the fact that Qaddafi
hasn’t folded,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at
Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago . “He’s backed into
a corner, and if he remains in power under a cease-fire, a
significant amount of uncertainty will come out of that
region.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $10.30, or 0.7
