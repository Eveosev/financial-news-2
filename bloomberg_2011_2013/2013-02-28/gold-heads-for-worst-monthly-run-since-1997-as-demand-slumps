Gold futures fell, capping the
longest run of monthly declines in 16 years, as signs of
economic optimism curbed demand for the metal as a haven.  Jobless claims in the U.S. dropped in the week that ended
Feb. 23, the government said today. German unemployment
unexpectedly fell in February amid signs that  Europe ’s biggest
economy is recovering, and  Japan ’s industrial production in
January rose for the second straight month. Gold has dropped 5.8
percent in 2013 after a 12-year rally boosted prices sixfold.  “Gold is no longer the preferred asset as people globally
are waking up to the fact that the economic conditions are
showing some signs of improvement,” Phil Streible, a senior
commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien & Associates, said in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for April delivery retreated 1.1 percent to
settle at $1,578.10 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal dropped 5 percent this month, the fifth straight
decline and the longest slump January 1997.  Yesterday, holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest
exchange-traded product backed by the metal, fell for the
seventh straight session, a record slump. They slid 12 metric
tons to 1,258.4 tons, the lowest since August.  Assets in a pool of gold ETPs yesterday slumped to a five-
month low of 2,508.5 tons. In February, they have dropped 4
percent, the most since April 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of equities headed for the fourth straight monthly
advance, the longest rally in a year.  Physical Liquidation  “Liquidation of physical gold is the hallmark of
bearishness,” Sterling Smith, a Chicago-based commodity futures
specialist at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said yesterday in a
telephone interview. “The improving economic conditions are
pushing people to more remunerative assets like equities.”  Gold may fall to $1,400 by the end of the third quarter,
Smith said.  Billionaire investors  George Soros  and Louis Moore Bacon
cut their stakes in gold ETPs last quarter, government filings
showed this month.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 1.9 percent to $28.432
an ounce on the Comex. The price dropped 9.3 percent this month.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery fell 1 percent to $1,583.50 an ounce, extending
the monthly loss to 5.5 percent.  Palladium futures for March delivery declined 1.5 percent
to $734.55 an ounce. The metal slipped 1.5 percent this month.
Volume was 29 percent lower than the average in the past 100
days for this time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
