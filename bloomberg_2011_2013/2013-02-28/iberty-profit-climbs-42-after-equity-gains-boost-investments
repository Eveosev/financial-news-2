Liberty Holdings Ltd. (LBH) , the insurer
controlled by  Standard Bank Group Ltd. (SBK) , climbed in Johannesburg
trading after announcing a special dividend and posting a 42
percent jump in full-year profit.  The insurer will pay a special dividend of 1.30 rand a
share after net income rose to 3.78 billion rand ($421 million)
from 2.67 billion rand in 2011, the Johannesburg-based company
said today in a statement. Earnings per share excluding one-time
items increased to 14.37 rand, beating the 12.63-rand median
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Profit surged after a 23 percent gain in South Africa’s
 stock market  boosted the value of Liberty Holdings’s
investments. The insurer has operations in 14 African countries
outside its home market after following Standard Bank in
targeting expansion in faster-growing parts of the continent.  “Earnings were generated on the back of good investment
performance on the group’s shareholder capital and strong
operating performances by the core retail South Africa and
Stanlib businesses,” Liberty Holdings said. “Our core
insurance and asset-management businesses are performing well
and we anticipate that they will continue to attract higher
levels of new business at improved margin.”  Liberty Holdings rose 1.3 percent to 116.50 rand in
Johannesburg. The stock gained 40 percent last year compared
with the average increase of 45 percent on the five-member
 FTSE/JSE Africa Life Assurers Index. (JLFEA)   Liberty Holdings announced a 13 percent increase in its
final ordinary dividend to 3.36 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
