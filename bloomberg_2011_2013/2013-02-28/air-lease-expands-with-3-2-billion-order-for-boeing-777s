Steven Udvar-Hazy’s  Air Lease Corp. (AL) 
agreed to buy 10  Boeing Co. (BA)  777 jetliners, with a catalog value
of $3.2 billion, to expand its fleet of long-haul jets.  Hazy, who created the aircraft-leasing business by founding
International Lease Finance Corp., later sold it to American
International Group Inc. Los Angeles-based  Air Lease , which he
started in 2010, amassed a fleet of 155 aircraft, most of which
are less than five years old, through Dec. 31, according to a
regulatory filing.  The order for 10 extended-range 777-300s “will help us
meet the growing airline demand for long-haul passenger
airplanes,” Chief Operating Officer  John Plueger  said in a
statement. The jetliner, with engines from General Electric Co.,
can carry 386 passengers as far as 7,825 nautical miles (14,490
kilometers.)  Large commercial airliners such as the twin-aisle 777 and
the grounded 787 Dreamliner from Boeing, as well as Airbus SAS’s
A330, command premium rates for lessors, who own about 35
percent of the airliner base today. That compares with less than
20 percent at the beginning of this century.  Air Lease has orders for another 325 aircraft through 2023,
according to the filing. Of those, 177 are from Chicago-based
Boeing, according to the company’s  website .  The extended-range 777-300 carries a price tag of  $315
million , though customers typically negotiate discounts. Air
Lease’s order follows a $9 billion agreement with Airbus earlier
this month for 25 A350 planes, which compete with Boeing’s 787.  Boeing has proposed a three-part fix to address battery
incidents that spurred the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration’s Jan. 16 ruling effectively barring flights of
the aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
