Romania plans to change its
renewables incentive scheme to reach a balance between the needs
of the industry and of the households, according to Constantin
Nita, the Minister Delegate for Energy.  The administration plans to sell a minority stake in
Transgaz SA by about April 15 and another one in
Nuclearelectrica SA by May 15, Nita said at a ZF Power Summit in
Bucharest today.  “We have one of the most generous incentives schemes and
we don’t want to eliminate it, we want to adjust it to reach a
certain balance between the needs of the industry and of the
households,” Nita said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
