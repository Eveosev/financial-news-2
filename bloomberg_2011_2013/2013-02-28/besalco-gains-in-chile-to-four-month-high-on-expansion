Besalco SA (BESALCO) , Chile’s second-largest
engineering and construction company, rose to the highest in
four months on speculation the company’s plan to expand in
Colombia will accelerate profit growth.  Besalco advanced 2.3 percent to 900 pesos at 12:58 p.m. in
Santiago. A close at that level would be the highest since Oct.
5. The stock was the second-biggest gainer today on Chile’s
benchmark  Ipsa index , which advanced 0.3 percent.  The Santiago-based builder plans to pursue engineering and
construction contracts in Colombia after setting up a unit in
the country with an initial capital of $100,000, according to a
Feb. 26 filing. Colombia’s economy is forecast to grow 4.5
percent this year, the fastest in  Latin America  after  Panama ,
 Peru  and Chile, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s a good sign that they are committed to entering a
new market,” Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst at brokerage
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a phone interview
today. “Colombia is growing strong and it has huge
infrastructure requirements.”  Besalco on Jan. 11 announced that it had walked away from
an agreement to acquire a 50 percent stake in local builder
Conciviles SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
