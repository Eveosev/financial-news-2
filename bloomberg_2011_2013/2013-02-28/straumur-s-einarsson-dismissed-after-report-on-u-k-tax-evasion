Petur Einarsson, the chief executive
officer of Iceland’s Straumur Investment Bank hf, was dismissed
after he was barred from acting as director of U.K. companies
for failing to pay taxes.  Jakob Asmundsson, the bank’s chief financial officer, will
take over as CEO effective immediately, according to a statement
on the bank’s  website .  Einarsson was the director of now-bankrupt London-based
Cbridge Ltd., a company which provided financial advice to the
aviation industry, the U.K.  Insolvency Service  said in a Feb. 13
statement on its website. He was found to have paid himself more
than 100,000 pounds ($152,000) out of the company’s profits to
“fund his own lifestyle but he made no attempt to pay the
mounting corporation taxes owed by the company,” according to
the statement. Cbridge went into voluntary liquidation in 2010.  Einarsson said yesterday in a telephone interview that the
U.K. ruling was “incredibly harsh and unfounded.”  The executive said he lost more than $1 million in claims
when the company failed and that he only took salary from the
company during the two years in question. “The person that has
lost the most from this was me,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
