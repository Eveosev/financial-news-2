State Oil Co. of  Azerbaijan  said it
plans to invest 50 million euros ($65 million) to more than
double the size of its retail network in Romania this year.  Socar will probably increase its Romanian network by 25
units, according to Hamza Karimov, who heads Socar’s local unit.
It currently has 14 in the nation.  “We have a plan to further develop our network in the
coming years and we’re analyzing further investments,” Karimov
said in an interview in Bucharest today. “If we manage to open
at least 20 stations this year, I’ll be happy.”  The state-owned energy producer seeks to more than double
its investment in Romania, where it has so far spent 20 million
euros and where  Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIIS)  AD, the Serbian energy
company controlled by  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  Neft, and Rompetrol Group NV
plan to expand their retail networks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
