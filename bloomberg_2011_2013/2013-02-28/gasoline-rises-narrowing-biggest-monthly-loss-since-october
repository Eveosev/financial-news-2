Gasoline rose, narrowing the largest
monthly decline since October. Crack spreads widened for the
first time in four days.  The March contract’s discount to April futures narrowed
0.47 cent to 24.51 cents a gallon as the U.S. prepares to switch
from winter- to summer-grade fuel. The April  crack spread , or
premium over West Texas Intermediate crude on Nymex, increased
26 cents to $36.96 a barrel. The  spread  versus  Brent crude  on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London  was up 6 cents to
$18.66. WTI and Brent were poised for monthly losses.  “The run-up we normally see in April may already have
happened,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago .  March-delivery gasoline rose 1.45 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.871 a gallon at 9:50 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
on volume that was more than double the 100-day average for the
time of day. Futures are down 5.1 percent this month.  The March contract expires today. The more actively traded
April-delivery futures rose 0.98 cent to $3.1161 a gallon. April
represents summer-grade gasoline, which uses costlier blending
components.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.4 cent to
$3.782 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices are up 15
percent this year.  Heating oil for March delivery gained 0.14 cent to $2.9893
a gallon on volume that was 47 percent above the 100-day
average. Prices are heading for a decline of 4.5 percent for
February, the biggest monthly drop since May. The April contract
fell 0.04 cent to $2.9842 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
