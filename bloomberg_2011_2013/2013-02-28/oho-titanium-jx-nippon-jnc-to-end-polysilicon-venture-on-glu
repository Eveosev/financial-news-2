(Corrects to remove reference to day in third paragraph.)  JX Nippon Mining & Metals Corp.,
 Toho Titanium Co. (5727)  and JNC Corp. will dissolve a polysilicon
production venture amid an international glut of solar panels.  They agreed to withdraw as demand for solar panels isnâ€™t
growing amid a  European debt crisis , while Chinese capacity is
increasing, the companies said today in a joint statement.  Japan Solar Silicon Co., set up in June 2008, will close
its factory by the end of March 2014 and the venture will be
dissolved by around June, Junichiro Tateya, a spokesman for JNC,
said by phone. JNC holds 50 percent, JX Nippon Mining & Metals
30 percent and Toho Titanium owns the rest.  The venture planned to produce 4,500 metric tons in 2013.
Tateya declined to say how much the venture was now producing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
