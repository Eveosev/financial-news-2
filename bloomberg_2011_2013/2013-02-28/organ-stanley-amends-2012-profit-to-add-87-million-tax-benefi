Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the world’s
largest brokerage, amended fourth-quarter earnings to include an
$87 million tax benefit disclosed in an annual filing this week.  Fourth-quarter net income was $594 million, or 29 cents a
share, compared with the $507 million, or 25 cents, previously
reported, according to an  amended statement  posted on Morgan
Stanley’s website. The New York-based firm’s 2012 profit was $68
million, compared with a previously disclosed $19 million loss.  Morgan Stanley completed a review of deferred tax accounts
this month and determined that a tax provision reported in 2012
should have been smaller, the New York-based firm said in an
annual regulatory filing this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
