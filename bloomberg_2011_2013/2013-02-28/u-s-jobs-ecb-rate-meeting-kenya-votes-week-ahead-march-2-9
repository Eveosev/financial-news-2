(Corrects date of Angela Merkel meeting in Warsaw, which is
March 6, and title of Francois Hollande in same item.)  U.S. employers probably added about
the same number of jobs in February as 157,000 a month earlier,
pointing to a slow economic expansion in the U.S.  The  European Central Bank , the Bank of Japan and the Bank
of England will hold rate-setting meetings in the coming week,
with each under fresh pressure to stimulate growth.  Kenyans will elect a president amid efforts to avoid the
ethnic violence that left more than 1,100 people dead in the
last ballot five years ago.  The  Federal Reserve  will release the results of stress
tests on the largest U.S. banks, and China’s government will
present 2013 budget forecasts when the nation’s legislature
holds its annual meeting.  MONDAY, MARCH 4  To contact the reporters on this story:
