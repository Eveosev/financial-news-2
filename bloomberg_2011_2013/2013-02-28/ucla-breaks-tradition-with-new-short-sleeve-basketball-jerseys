The school that won a record 11
men’s college basketball championships with a legacy that
includes  John Wooden ,  Bill Walton  and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is
going against tradition, at least when it comes to uniforms.  UCLA is among three Division I teams that will wear short-
sleeve jerseys for the rest of this season, spurning the
sleeveless shirts that have been worn almost universally in
basketball since before Wooden started coaching at the
University of California-Los Angeles in 1948.  The University of Louisville and Baylor University will
also wear the new  Adidas AG (ADS)  jerseys, which were debuted last
week by the National Basketball Association’s Golden State
Warriors. The short-sleeved jerseys are made of tight-fitting,
stretchy fabric that dries quickly and is designed for maximum
mobility, Adidas said in a statement.  UCLA’s new jersey is blue with yellow lettering and
striping around the neck and on the shoulders. The sleeves of
the jersey and the Bruins’ matching shorts feature a camouflage
print in several shades of blue.  The Bruins’ traditional home uniform is light blue with
gold trim and lettering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
