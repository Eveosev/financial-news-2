Bovespa-index futures declined, with
the equity gauge poised for its biggest monthly drop since May,
after iron-ore producer  Vale SA (VALE3)  posted a record loss in the
fourth quarter.  Embraer SA (EMBR3) , the world’s fourth-largest plane builder, may
be active after winning a U.S. military contract valued at as
much as $950 million in a partnership with Sierra Nevada Corp.
Airline  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOL)  may move after saying
its frequent-flyer unit Smiles filed a request with securities
regulators to sell shares in an initial public offering.  Bovespa-index  futures  sank 0.3% to 57,410 at 9:05 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. The Bovespa index is down 4.2 percent this month,
poised for a second straight monthly decline. The real climbed
0.2 percent to 1.9698 per dollar.  Vale, the heaviest weighted stock on the  Bovespa (IBOV)  index,
posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.65 billion, or 51 cents a
share, compared with a profit of $4.67 billion, or 91 cents, a
year earlier, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said late
yesterday in a statement. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or adjusted Ebitda, declined 41
percent to $4.39 billion, missing a $4.79 billion average
estimate by 14 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark equity gauge has dropped 9.5 percent from
this year’s high on Jan. 3 amid concern that accelerating
inflation may curb Brazil’s economic recovery and that the
government’s interventionist policies will hurt profits in
industries including utilities and energy. The  MSCI BRIC Index (MXBRIC) 
of shares in Brazil, Russia, India and China has slid 3.9
percent over the same period.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge  trades  at 11.7 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.5 for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  of 21
developing nations’ equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume for stocks in  Sao Paulo  was 7.86 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of 7.53
billion reais this year through Feb. 26, according to data
compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
