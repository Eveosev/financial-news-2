The Chilean peso headed for its
second-smallest monthly change in three years as speculation
that the central bank might take steps to trim the currency’s
advance pushed exchange-rate volatility to the lowest in 15
years.  The currency fell 0.4 percent to 472.95 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 12:58 p.m. in Santiago. The 30-day volatility in the currency
fell to the lowest since 1998, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The monthly change was the smallest after November’s
0.03 percent drop.  The peso was little changed today as U.S. economic data
weighed on copper, offsetting figures showing the Andean
country’s manufacturing industry grew faster than forecast last
month.  “We had a bit of a shake-up when the U.S. data came out,”
said Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerican
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The local data was good
but in line, but we saw big buying of dollars after the U.S.
numbers.”  Copper for May delivery unwound a 1 percent gain after the
Commerce Department said the world’s largest economy grew at a
0.1 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2012, slower
than the 0.5 percent median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  Chile ’s National Statistics Institute had
earlier said manufacturing expanded 4.3 percent in January after
contracting in December. Copper is Chile’s biggest export.  To contact the reporter on this story:
