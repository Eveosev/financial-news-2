Colombian monetary policy needs to
remain expansive for a “very long time”, central bank co-
director Carlos Gustavo Cano said today in an interview on
Javeriana Radio.  “The principles that we follow indicate that there is a
space to continue with an expansive posture and, not only is
there space to continue an expansive posture, but I feel there
is a need to continue with this posture for a very long time.”  Colombia ’s economy has a potential growth rate of 4.8
percent, and is likely to grow less than that in 2013, Cano
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
