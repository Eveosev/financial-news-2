Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will increase  duties  on most oil shipments abroad by
4.3 percent on March 1 to the highest level since May after
Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export duty will increase to $420.60 a metric
ton, or about $57.38 a barrel, from $403.30 a ton this month,
according an order signed by Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  and
published today on the government’s  website . The duty was
$448.60 a ton in May 2012.  The government won’t change the current 60-66 oil export
duty system this year, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich 
said Feb. 22. Production was 10.45 million barrels a day in
January, near a post-Soviet high and above President  Vladimir Putin ’s goal of more than 10 million barrels a day, according to
data from the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. Oil and gas
provide about half of Russia’s budget revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades will grow to $211.40 a ton from $198.50 this month.
The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the standard
duty, will be $42 in March.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $114.38 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said Feb. 15. In the previous monitoring
period, it averaged $110.43, according to the ministry.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as  fuel oil , will increase to $277.60 a ton from
$266.20. A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude oil duty
since May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, will grow to
$378.60 a ton in March from $363 this month.  The government will lower the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $131.40 a ton from $200.30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
