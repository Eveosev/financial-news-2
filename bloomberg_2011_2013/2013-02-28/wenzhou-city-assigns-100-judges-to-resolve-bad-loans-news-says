Wenzhou, the eastern Chinese city
hit hardest by the collapse of private lending last year, will
assign about 100 judges to clear up mounting bad loans at its
lenders, the China News Service said.  The judges will work with 50 to 100 financial institutions
starting next month to deal with soured assets in the city’s
banking system, the state  news agency   reported  yesterday, citing
unidentified court officials. Wenzhou’s non-performing loans
have soared to 23.86 billion  yuan  ($3.8 billion), from 8.6
billion yuan in 2011, according to the news agency.  In Wenzhou, an export hub where almost 90 percent of
families have taken part in underground lending, more than 100
people have fled, committed suicide or declared bankruptcy from
August 2011 through last May, and at least 800 lending brokers
went bankrupt, according to Xinhua News Agency.  The local government will also assign judges with
experience in commercial cases to 100 troubled entities, the
China News Service said in yesterday’s report.  The judges will provide legal assistance to companies that
have promising outlooks, while weeding out failing enterprises
in industries with high pollution and energy consumption through
bankruptcy, the news service said.  Wenzhou last year set up a financial court and simplified
bankruptcy proceedings as cases soared amid an economic slowdown
in the U.S. and  Europe  and the collapse of the city’s private
lending market.  Two phone calls to the press offices of Wenzhou
Intermediate Court and the local government’s financial services
departments seeking comment today went unanswered.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
