China issued environmental
protection guidelines for the country’s companies to follow when
investing overseas, calling on them to pay more attention to
pollution and its impact on local communities.  The  Ministry of Commerce  and the  Ministry of Environmental
Protection  issued the guidelines so that Chinese companies can
reduce disputes arising from the neglect of environmental
issues, Yao Jian, a commerce ministry spokesman, said at a
briefing in Beijing yesterday. The guidelines call on companies
to follow local environmental laws, assess the environmental
risks of their projects, minimize the impact on local heritage
and draft plans for handling emergencies.  “We want our companies to realize that they must look
after environmental issues in domestic and overseas
investments,” Bie Tao, a policy department official from the
Chinese environment ministry, said at the briefing. “No side
will win if the environment is neglected, and we have many
lessons in this regard.”  Zambia last week revoked the license of a Chinese-owned
coal mine in the south of the country after violations of safety
and environmental laws. In Myanmar, construction of a $3.6
billion hydropower plant by a venture between  China  Power
Investment Corp., Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power-1 and a
local private company was halted after the project drew the
criticism of environmentalists and local residents protested.  China’s outbound investment in the non-financial sector
jumped 28.6 percent to $77.2 billion in 2012, according to the
commerce ministry.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
