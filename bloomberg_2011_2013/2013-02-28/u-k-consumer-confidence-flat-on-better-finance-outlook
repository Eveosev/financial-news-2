U.K.  consumer confidence  held steady
this month as optimism about personal finances rose to the
highest in almost two years, GfK NOP Ltd. said.  The sentiment index stayed at minus 26 after increasing by
3 points in January, the London-based group said in a report
today. The February reading matched the median forecast of 21
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. A measure of personal
finances rose 2 points to minus 5, the highest since May 2011.  “While an unchanged figure may not seem very good news,
the maintenance of all of last month’s 3-point gain is
encouraging,” said Nick Moon, managing director of social
research at GfK. “Consumers may be regaining their breath.”  The  Bank of England  forecasts a “slow but sustained”
recovery for the economy this year. Still, consumers may remain
under pressure from rising energy bills and  accelerating
inflation . GfK’s gauge of the climate for making major purchases
dropped 4 points this month to minus 26, while the headline
index remains well below its long-run average of minus 9.  A measure of Britons’ outlook for the economy over the next
12 months was unchanged at minus 25 in February, while their
view of the past year slipped 1 point to minus 52. Data
yesterday showed U.K. gross domestic product fell 0.3 percent in
the fourth quarter.  GfK interviewed 2,002 people from Feb. 1 to Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
