Arcam AB (ARCM) , a maker of manufacturing
systems based on digital three-dimensional models, rose to its
highest level in almost 10 years after the company won an order
from an undisclosed U.S. client.  Arcam climbed as much as 8.5 percent to 273.50 kronor, the
highest intraday price since March 2003. The stock was up 5.8
percent at 266.5 kronor as of 11:05 a.m. in  Stockholm , giving
the company a market value of 995 million kronor ($154 million).  The company makes equipment for manufacturing parts from
metal powder and is focused toward the orthopedic implant and
aerospace industries. The U.S. client will use Arcam’s system to
produce components in the aerospace area, the Moelndal, Sweden-
based company said in a statement today.  “This deal confirms the strong interest in Additive
Manufacturing within the  aerospace industry ,” Arcam Chief
Executive Officer Magnus Rene said in the statement. “We are
convinced that both interest and demand will continue to
increase and we are well positioned to capitalize on this
development.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
