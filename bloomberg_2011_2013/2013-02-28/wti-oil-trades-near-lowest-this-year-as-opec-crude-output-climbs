West Texas Intermediate dropped to
the lowest price this year and headed for a second weekly
decline as Chinese manufacturing expanded less than forecast and
OPEC crude production rose for the first time in six months.  WTI fell below $91 a barrel in  New York  for the first time
since Dec. 31. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
raised output by 97,000 barrels to 30.7 million a day in
February, a Bloomberg survey showed.  China ’s manufacturing
purchasing managers index fell to 50.1 last month, compared with
a median forecast of 50.5. Oil also fell as $85 billion of
spending cuts were about to be triggered in the U.S.  “There are worries about slower growth in China,” said
 Robert Montefusco , a senior broker at Sucden Financial Ltd. in
 London , who predicts that the European benchmark,  Brent crude ,
may slide to $110 a barrel this month.  WTI for April delivery declined as much as $1.61, or 1.8
percent, to $90.44 in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $90.70 as of 1:19 p.m. London
time. The volume of all futures traded was 57 percent above the
100-day average. Prices are down 2.6 percent this week and have
lost 6.9 percent this month, the first time since 2006 that WTI
has fallen in February.  Brent for April settlement dropped $1.07 to $110.31 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume
was more than double the 100-day average. The European benchmark
grade was at a premium of $19.60 to WTI, compared with $19.33
yesterday.  Saudi Output  OPEC crude output climbed as a gain by  Libya  outweighed a
cut by  Saudi Arabia , the Bloomberg survey showed. Libyan daily
production increased by 130,000 barrels to 1.24 million last
month, the biggest gain of any member, after the reopening of
the country’s Zueitina export terminal early in February.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, pumped 9 million
barrels a day, the lowest level since May 2011, according to the
survey. Output was down 100,000 barrels from January and 900,000
barrels from May, when production reached the highest since at
least January 1989.  In China, the world’s second-biggest oil consumer,
manufacturing slowed last month, the PMI report from the
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing in Beijing showed. The
reading fell from 50.4 in January. A separate gauge from HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics dropped to a four-month low of
50.4 from 52.3. A level above 50 indicates expansion.  Gasoline Prices  Automatic cuts set to take effect today will pinch U.S.
government functions as the country enters a more austere era
that could push discretionary spending as a share of the economy
to its lowest level in at least 50 years.  U.S. lawmakers locked in partisan feuds are turning to
across-the-board cuts in national security, education and anti-
poverty programs rather than structural changes to retirees’
benefits and the  tax code .  Refinery seasonal maintenance will continue to pressure
gasoline  prices , AAA, the biggest U.S. motoring organization,
said yesterday. The national average for regular gasoline at the
pump yesterday was $3.782 a gallon, the highest-ever level for
this time of year. February’s average of $3.65 was a record.  WTI may decline next week amid U.S. government spending
cuts and crude inventories at a seven-month high, a Bloomberg
survey showed. Twenty-one of 37 analysts and traders, or 57
percent, forecast crude will decline through March 8. Twelve
respondents, or 32 percent, predicted an increase, and four
forecast little change.  The decline may stall as futures approach technical support
along the 100-day moving average, a level where buy orders tend
to be clustered. This indicator is around $90.86 a barrel today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Crude’s 14-day relative
strength index has also dropped to about 34, the lowest in four
months. A reading below 30 signals prices have fallen too
quickly for further losses to be sustainable.  To contact the reporters on this story:
