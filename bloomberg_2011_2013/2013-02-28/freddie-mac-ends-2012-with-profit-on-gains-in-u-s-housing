Freddie Mac  said rising home prices
and falling mortgage delinquencies helped it post a profit for
the fourth quarter and all of 2012, allowing it to avoid drawing
more funds from U.S. taxpayers.  The U.S.-owned mortgage financier, based in McLean,
 Virginia , had net income of $4.5 billion for the three months
ended Dec. 31 after accounting for a $5.8 billion dividend
payment to the Treasury Department for the government stake, the
company said today in a statement.  “It’s clear from our earnings that the housing market has
turned a corner and that our work to minimize legacy losses and
build a strong new book of business is paying off,” Freddie Mac
Chief Executive Officer Donald Layton said in the statement.  For all of 2012,  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  reported net income of $11
billion, compared with a net loss of $5.3 billion in 2011.  Freddie Mac and Washington-based  Fannie Mae  have received
almost $190 billion in U.S. assistance since they were taken
into federal conservatorship in September 2008 amid losses on
risky loans that pushed them to the brink of insolvency.  Freddie Mac has paid $23.8 billion in dividends, about a
third of the amount it has taken in Treasury aid.  Starting this year, the two taxpayer-owned companies will
cease paying 10 percent dividends to the Treasury and will
instead pay any profits above a permitted capital reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
