The former Rangers Football Club
will not be stripped of the five championships it won between
2000 and 2011 because of the use of employee benefit trusts, the
British Broadcasting Corp. said without saying where it got the
information.  The company that formerly ran the club has been fined
250,000 pounds ($380,000), the  BBC  said.  The commission appointed by the Scottish Premier League to
investigate alleged undisclosed player payments will issue its
written judgment later today, the BBC said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
