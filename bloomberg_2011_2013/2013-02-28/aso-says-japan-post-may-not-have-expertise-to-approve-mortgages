     Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) --Japanese Financial Services Minister
Taro Aso signaled concern about Japan Post Holdings Co.’s plan
to start residential and corporate lending, saying the state-run
company doesn’t have the necessary expertise.  “Japan Post isn’t capable of assessing loan
applications,” Aso said during a meeting with heads of
financial lobby groups at the agency today.  The state-owned parent of the bank and insurance units
applied for government approval in September to start offering
mortgages and corporate loans from April.  The Japanese Bankers Association is among groups that have
opposed Japan Post’s entry to loan market, saying the move would
distort fair competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
