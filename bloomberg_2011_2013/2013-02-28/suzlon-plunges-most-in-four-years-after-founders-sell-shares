Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  fell the most in
more than four years after founders of  India ’s largest wind
turbine maker sold 109.9 million shares.  The stock plunged 34 percent, the biggest drop since
October 2008, to 16 rupees at the close in Mumbai. Suzlon’s
 founders  sold the shares, which account for 6.19 percent of the
company, to raise 2.4 billion rupees ($44 million) to repay
lenders as part of a debt-recast plan, according to an e-mailed
statement from the Pune-based turbine maker today.  Suzlon completed refinancing $1.8 billion in domestic  debt 
last month after failing to pay $209 million of foreign-currency
convertible notes on Oct. 11. That was India’s biggest
convertible-bond default and fanned concerns that creditors may
demand immediate payment of other loans.  “Founders selling their stake in the company to raise
funds for repaying debt shows their desperation,” said Sudip Bandyopadhyay, chief executive officer at Mumbai-based
Destimoney Securities Pvt.  The founders sold shares to support the company’s debt
restructuring plan, Chief Financial Officer Kirti Vagadia said
in a phone interview today. Shares freed up after paying
bondholders will be pledged to existing lenders to support the
debt restructuring, he said.  The company’s founders have no plans to sell more shares in
the market, Vagadia said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
