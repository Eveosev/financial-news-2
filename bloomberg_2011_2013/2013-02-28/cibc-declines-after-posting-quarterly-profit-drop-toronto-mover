Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest lender, fell the most in five months
after posting a decline in first-quarter profit and maintaining
its current dividend.  CIBC fell 1.7 percent to C$82.50 at 11:22 a.m. in Toronto,
the most intraday since Sept. 26. The shares have gained 3.3
percent this year, compared to the 4.2 percent  advance  of the
eight-company Standard & Poor’s/TSX Commercial Banks Industry
Index.  Profit for the period ended Jan. 31 fell 4.4 percent to
C$798 million, the Toronto-based bank said today in a statement.
CIBC also maintained its 94 cent-a-share dividend while larger
rivals Royal Bank of Canada and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  increased
their payouts.  Bloomberg Dividend Forecasts estimated CIBC to raise its
quarterly payout.  CIBC also said in the statement that its Aeroplan credit-
card partnership with  Aimia Inc. (AIM)  will expire Dec. 31 unless both
companies agree to extend. Aimia fell 2.4 percent to C$15.18 in
Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
