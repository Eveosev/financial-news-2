Palm, the most-consumed cooking oil,
will probably slump as much as 21 percent in the next three
months to the lowest level in four years, according to  technical
analysis  by TransGraph Consulting Pvt.  The most-active contract on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange may decline to 1,900 ringgit ($614) a metric ton as the
moving average convergence-divergence indicator signals weakness
on the monthly chart, said Ravi Chandra, vice president of
Hyderabad, India-based TransGraph.  “Futures are in a long-term downtrend,” said Chandra, who
has predicted prices for the past 12 years. “The monthly MACD
falling below the zero line indicates the existing weakness to
stretch further,” he said in an e-mail yesterday.  The MACD indicator is a gauge of momentum derived by
subtracting a 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-day
average. A second measure, called the signal line, uses the
nine-day moving average of the MACD indicator.  The tropical oil, used in everything from candy bars to
biofuels, plunged to a three-year low of 2,217 ringgit on Dec.
13 as stockpiles climbed in Malaysia and  Indonesia , the main
producers. Futures declined 0.8 percent to 2,392 ringgit today.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
