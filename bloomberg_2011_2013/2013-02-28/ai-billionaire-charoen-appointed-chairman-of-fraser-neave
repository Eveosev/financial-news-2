Thailand ’s richest billionaire
Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi became chairman of Fraser & Neave Ltd.
after his S$13.8 billion ($11.2 billion) takeover of the 130-
year-old property and beverage company.  The appointment is effective from Feb. 28, Singapore-based
F&N said in a statement yesterday. Charoen, 68, replaces Lee
Hsien Yang, who stepped down Feb. 26. Wanna Sirivadhanabhakdi,
69, Charoen’s wife, was named the vice chairman.  Charoen won control of F&N in January after his Jan. 18
offer of S$9.55 a share gained the backing of a majority of
shareholders and topped a proposal from rival  Overseas Union
Enterprise Ltd. (OUE)  The deal gives Charoen control over a company
that has assets from soft drinks to serviced apartments across
Southeast Asia. The billionaire first invested in F&N in July,
setting off a fight for its assets that led to the biggest
acquisition of a Singapore-based company.  Pailin Chuchottaworn, president and chief executive officer
of  PTT Pcl (PTT) , Thailand’s biggest company, also joined the F&N
board, along with Chan Heng Wing and Charles Mak Ming Ying,
according to the statement. F&N’s board now has nine members
after the appointments.  Lee, the former chief executive officer of  Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. (ST) , is the younger brother of Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
