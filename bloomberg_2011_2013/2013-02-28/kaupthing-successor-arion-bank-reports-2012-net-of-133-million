The Reykjavik-based bank had a net
income of 16.6 billion kronur ($133 million) last year up from
10.5 billion kronur in 2011, the company said in a statement on
its website today.  Arion Banki hf was created in 2008 from the domestic
operations of  Kaupthing Bank hf  after Kaupthing was unable to
secure short-term funding and failed in October of that year.
Kaupthing’s collapse left creditors struggling to recoup $31
billion in debt.  After Arion’s creation, Iceland’s government handed over an
87 percent stake in the lender to Kaupthing’s creditors as
compensation for its domestic assets. Iceland’s Treasury retains
a 13 percent stake.  Net interest income rose to 27.1 billion kronur from 23.4
billion kronur in 2011, and operating income was 44.8 billion
kronur, up from 33.3 billion kronur a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
