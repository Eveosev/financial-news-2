European Union carbon permits surged
the most in two weeks after a German lawmaker said  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  shares her environment minister’s stance on
reducing a surplus of the allowances.  The December contract jumped 9.6 percent, the most since
Feb. 13, to close at 4.90 euros ($6.41) a metric ton, according
to data from the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . They
earlier fell as much as 2.7 percent.  It’s a “myth that repairing the emissions trading system
is anti-business,” Christian Ruck, deputy chairman of the
ruling CDU/CSU coalition in German parliament, told reporters in
Berlin. A plan to delay the sale of some allowances was a
temporary solution to the market’s glut, he said.  Environment Minister  Peter Altmaier  backs the November EU
Commission proposal to temporarily withhold 900 million tons of
carbon permits through 2015. Economy Minister Philipp Roesler
opposes intervention in the market, the world’s biggest
greenhouse gas program by traded volume.  Germany  is auctioning 5 million tons of allowances tomorrow
after a sale of permits failed last week when bids didn’t reach
the reserve price, according to the European Energy Exchange AG
in Leipzig.  December Certified Emission Reduction credits dropped 2
cents to 35 cents. March CERs fell 4 cents to 27 cents after
yesterday’s 14 cent jump.  To contact the reporters on this story:
