National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  sold
A$300 million ($308 million) of five-year Kangaroo bonds, the
first Australian dollar-denominated notes by a Middle Eastern-
based company since before the global financial crisis.  The 5 percent notes maturing in March 2018 were priced to
yield 175 basis points more than the benchmark swap rate,
according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to
be identified because the terms are private. The sale would be
the company’s first Kangaroo bond, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The United Arab Emirates’  second-biggest lender  by assets
last sold Australian dollar debt in 2007, offering A$30 million
of one-year floating-rate securities outside the South Pacific
nation, according to the data. Emirates Bank International
PJSC’s A$250 million of notes in November 2006 was the first
Kangaroo by a Middle Eastern borrower, the data show.  NBAD said last month that it planned to sell bonds after
reporting a higher-than-expected increase in fourth-quarter
profit. Banks in the U.A.E. are recovering from the credit
crisis, which slowed lending, hurt  investment banking  and
sparked a crash in property prices.  Today’s sale was jointly managed by Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., Bank of America Corp. and the borrower, the
person said.  Moody’s Investors Service rates the Abu Dhabi-based bank at
Aa3, its fourth-highest  investment grade , while  Standard &
Poor’s  ranks it one step lower at A+, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
