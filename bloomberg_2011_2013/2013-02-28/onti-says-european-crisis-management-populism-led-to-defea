Defeated Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti blamed crisis-management mistakes at the European
level and populism at home for this week’s electoral drubbing
that threw Italy into political chaos.  Monti faulted the “central and northern European”
approach to the debt crisis for keeping Italy’s interest rates
too high for too long and undercutting domestic support for his
overhaul of the Italian economy.  “You do the right policies, but you don’t get the
recognition, then there may be a backlash against the right
policies and the coming-up of political forces that oppose the
right policies,” Monti said at a conference in Brussels today.  Monti, who finished fourth in the Italian election, said he
paid a political price for refusing to seek the extra time to
reduce Italy’s budget deficit that was granted to countries such
as Spain and Portugal.  As political blocs jockeyed for position in Rome, Monti
said the next government should press ahead with reforms and
deregulation that he said will “significantly” boost Italy’s
growth “if fully implemented.”  Monti, who served on the Brussels-based  European Commission 
for a decade, said there is a risk that economic policies in
Europe’s interest will be derailed by “the most simplistic,
some would say populist” forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
