Robert Schmieder has left his job as
a Latin America corporate credit analyst at  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
according to two people familiar with the matter who asked not
to be identified because the information is private.  Juanita Gutierrez, a spokeswoman for HSBC in New York,
declined to comment on Schmieder, citing company policy on
personnel moves. Sarah Leshner will lead Latin American
corporate coverage from New York, Gutierrez said.  Schmieder, who also was based in New York, joined HSBC from
 Credit Agricole  in 2010. He declined to comment when reached on
his home telephone.  LatinFinance reported Schmiederâ€™s departure earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
