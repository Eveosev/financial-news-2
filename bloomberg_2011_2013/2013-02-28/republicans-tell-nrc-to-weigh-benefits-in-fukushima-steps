House Republicans said the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission should consider the additional
costs of measures ordered in response to the reactor disaster in
Japan two years ago.  “Safety gains should be significant enough to outweigh
additional costs” to be paid by industry, Representative  John Shimkus  of Illinois, chairman of an Energy and Commerce
subcommittee, said today at a hearing in Washington with the
five NRC commissioners.  The NRC is voting on a staff proposal to require radiation-
screening filters on vents at 31 of the oldest U.S. reactors,
which  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  of Chicago has said would cost $15 million to
$20 million at each unit. The agency is seeking to improve U.S.
safety after a triple meltdown at Japan’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant in March 2011.  Environmental groups have said the recommendation for
filters is necessary and overdue, while the  Nuclear Energy
Institute , a Washington-based industry group, has said upgrades
should be considered on a plant-specific basis.  Representative Ed Whitfield, a Kentucky Republican, joined
Shimkus in saying any additional costs on reactors should be
justified by safety benefits. Democrats including
Representatives Paul Tonko of New York and  Henry Waxman  of
California said the NRC should adopt its staff’s recommendation
to require the filters.  “To the public, there is no such thing as a small nuclear
accident,” said Tonko, the top Democrat on the panel.  NRC Chairman  Allison Macfarlane  declined to comment on the
commission’s voting because it was still in progress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
