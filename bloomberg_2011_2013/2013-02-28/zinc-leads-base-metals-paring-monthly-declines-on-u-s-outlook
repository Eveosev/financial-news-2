Zinc lead gains in base metals,
which pared monthly losses, as better-than-expected U.S.
economic data boosted demand outlook in the second-largest user.  Zinc for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.9
percent to $2,097.5 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $2,092 at 11:17 a.m. Shanghai time. The metal
has lost 2.5 percent this month, the least among the six primary
base metals traded on the bourse. Copper rose 0.5 percent to
$7,912 a ton, while the  LME Index (LMEX)  declined 4.1 percent this
month through yesterday, the most since October.  Orders for U.S. durable goods excluding transportation gear
gained in January by the most in a year, while pending home
sales increased more than forecast. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday recent increases in some  interest
rates  may signal the  U.S. economy  is gaining vigor.  “Good data from the U.S. in the last two days prompted
some short-covering in metals,” Zhang Tianfeng, an analyst at
Dongxing Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai. “The market
focus in China will be on the policy tone set in the National
People’s Congress meetings next week, so we may see it provides
cues for demand this year.”  The annual session of the congress will start on March 5 to
set this year’s growth target and economic policies. The
statistics bureau will release the official  Purchasing Managers ’
Index for February tomorrow, which may climb to 50.5 from 50.4 a
month earlier, according to the median in a Bloomberg survey. A
number above 50 signals expansion.  Copper for delivery in June on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.4 percent to 57,700  yuan  ($9,273) a metric
ton, and the May contract on the Comex in New York climbed 0.8
percent to $3.594 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
