Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,
the mining company purchasing Plains Exploration & Production
Co. and  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  for about $9 billion, issued
$6.5 billion in a four-part bond sale to help fund the
acquisition.  The world’s largest publicly traded copper producer sold
$1.5 billion of 2.375 percent, five-year securities to yield
162.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $1
billion of 3.1 percent, seven-year debt at a relative yield of
187.5 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company also issued $2 billion each of 3.875 percent, 10-year
notes at a 200 basis-point spread and 5.45 percent, 30-year
bonds at 237.5.  The debt is rated Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
ratings company said today in a statement.  The deal announced Dec. 5 will give Freeport oil fields in
the Gulf of Mexico, after Houston-based Plains bought assets
from  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  for $6.1 billion in
September.  “The transactions do provide a certain amount of
diversification into another commodity market with positive
fundamentals,” Wen Li, an analyst at Creditsights Inc., wrote
in a research note today.  The bonds, with the exception of the five-year notes, will
be redeemed at 101 cents on the dollar if the deal is not
completed by June 5 or, if extended, by Sept. 5, according to a
person familiar with the transaction, who asked not to be
identified citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the
offering, Bloomberg data show. Freeport last sold debt a year
ago, issuing $3 billion in a three-part issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
