Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) 
plan to drill a second well in the Neptun block, which they are
jointly exploring in the  Black Sea , as early as the end of this
year, said John Knapp, the head of Exxon’s local unit.  The two companies may complete three-dimensional studies by
the middle of this year as they seek to deepen the block’s
appraisal to evaluate the resources and their commercial value,
Knapp said in an interview in Bucharest today.  “If we drill, it will be late this year, depending on the
availability of the rigs,” Knapp said. “For a new appraisal of
the block, we need to complete the 3D seismic studies and
interpret the data and there is also additional drilling that
needs to be done.”  Exxon and Petrom started searching for oil and gas in the
Romanian portion of the Black Sea and conducted the first
drilling operation of the Domino-1 well in the Neptun block at
the end of 2011.  OMV AG (OMV) , Petrom’s majority owner, said last
February that the Domino-1 well encountered 70.7 meters of net
gas pay that resulted in a preliminary estimate of accumulation
ranging from 1.5 to 3 trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion
cubic meters).  To contact the reporters on this story:
