German plant and machinery orders
declined in January on weak domestic demand, signaling that the
economic recovery will be bumpy.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, fell 2 percent from a year
earlier after increasing an annual 4 percent in December, the
VDMA machine-makersâ€™ association said in  Frankfurt  today.
Domestic orders dropped 7 percent, while foreign demand rose 1
percent. Orders were unchanged in the three months through
January, it said.  German production of plant and machinery will increase 2
percent this year, VDMA forecast on Dec. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
