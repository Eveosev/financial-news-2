Natural gas production from the
Barnett Shale formation in  Texas , the second-largest U.S. gas
resource, peaked in 2012 and will fall by more than half in the
next 17 years, according to a University of Texas study.  Annual output from the Barnett Shale will decline to about
900 billion cubic feet in 2030 from about 2 trillion cubic feet
in 2012, the  Bureau of Economic Geology  at the University of
Texas in Austin said in a report today.  The study found that the geologic formation near Fort
Worth, Texas, contains 44 trillion cubic feet of recoverable
gas, enough to supply about nine years of U.S. household demand,
based on Energy Department figures. The studyâ€™s future
production estimates assumed average gas prices of $4 per
thousand cubic feet.  Energy explorers such as  Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  have
scaled back drilling in the Barnett Shale and other U.S. gas
fields after a decade of intensive production flooded domestic
markets, depressing prices for the fuel. U.S. gas averaged $3.33
per million British thermal units this year, down 70 percent
from the average in July 2008 when prices rose to more than $13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Marcellus Shale that underlies several eastern states
is the largest U.S. gas resource, according to ITG Investment
Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
