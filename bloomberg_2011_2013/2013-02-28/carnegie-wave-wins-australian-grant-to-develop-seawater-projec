Carnegie Wave Energy Ltd. (CWE) , an
Australian marine technology developer, won a A$1.3 million
($1.3 million) grant from the government to built a seawater
desalination project powered by wave energy.  The funds from Australia’s Clean Technology Innovation
Program will help develop a A$2.5 million pilot plant in  Western
Australia  to produce fresh water, Perth-based Carnegie Wave said
today in a statement.  Carnegie Wave plans to show that “wave energy-driven
seawater desalination has the potential to significantly and
sustainably reduce the amount of electricity consumed,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
