Spot gasoline in  Portland  dropped
against futures by the most in almost two months, reaching a
discount for the first time since Feb. 4.  Portland 84-octane gasoline slid 14 cents to a discount of
3 cents a gallon against futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 1:49 p.m. Eastern time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg, the biggest swing since Jan. 4.  Los Angeles  gasoline’s discount lost 12.5 cents yesterday
and  San Francisco ’s declined 12 cents as refineries in Southern
 California  restored production after planned work.  “It’s catching up to what happened in San Francisco and
Los Angeles yesterday,” said Chris Mennis, president of broker
New Wave Energy LLC in Aptos, California. “There’s poor demand
on the West Coast and two turnarounds completed.”  California-blend gasoline  in Los Angeles advanced 1.25
cents today to a discount of 3.75 cents a gallon against New
York futures, while the fuel  in San Francisco  gained 3.75 cents
to a discount of 11.25 cents.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco slid
3.75 cents to a premium of 10.75 cents a gallon against heating
oil futures traded on the Nymex. The premium for the same fuel
 in Los Angeles  narrowed 2.75 cents to 13.25 cents a gallon.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland gained 0.5 cent to a premium
of 13.5 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
