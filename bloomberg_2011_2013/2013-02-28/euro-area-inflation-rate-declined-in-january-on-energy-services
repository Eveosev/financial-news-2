The  euro-area inflation rate  fell in
January, led by slower price growth for energy and services.  Annual consumer-price growth slowed to 2 percent from 2.2
percent in December, in line with an initial estimate on Feb. 1,
the European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg said today.
In the month, prices fell 1 percent.  The  European Central Bank  will probably maintain its
benchmark interest rate at 0.75 percent next week, according to
a  Bloomberg News survey  of economists. The ECB will update its
December economic forecasts after the euro area’s recession
deepened in the fourth quarter. The European Commission sees
inflation at 1.8 percent this year and 1.5 percent in 2014.  The annual core inflation rate, excluding volatile costs
such as energy, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 1.3 percent in
January from 1.5 percent a month earlier, today’s report showed.
The cost of energy rose 3.9 percent after a 5.2 percent annual
gain in December, while services-price growth slowed to 1.6
percent from 1.8 percent. Food, alcohol and tobacco costs rose
3.2 percent.  European Union car sales last month fell to the lowest
level for a month of January since the data series began in
1990. Manufacturers in the region have announced 30,000 job cuts
and five plant shutdowns since July, with  Renault (RNO)  and Peugeot
outlining domestic workforce reductions of 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
