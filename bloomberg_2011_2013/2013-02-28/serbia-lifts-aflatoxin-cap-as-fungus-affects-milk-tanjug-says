Serbia raised the permitted level of
aflatoxins in milk 10-fold, a week after reports that the fungal
contamination spread to the dairy product from corn, according
to Tanjug.  The government is restoring the old cap of 0.5 microgram a
kilogram (2.2 pounds), which was replaced two years ago by a
limit of 0.05 microgram, the state-owned news agency today cited
Agriculture Minister Goran Knezevic as saying.  The higher level of aflatoxins, produced by fungi and
considered carcinogenic to people and animals, is the same as in
Russia, the U.S., Brazil, India,  Argentina  and  Bulgaria  and
poses no threat to human health, the minister said, according to
Tanjug.  To contact the reporters on this story:
