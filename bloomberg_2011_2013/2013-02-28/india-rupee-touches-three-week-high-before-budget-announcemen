India ’s rupee rose to the highest
level in almost three weeks on speculation the government will
rein in the widest fiscal deficit among major  emerging markets .  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram, who presents the
annual budget to parliament at 11 a.m. in  New Delhi  today, has
vowed to pare the gap to 4.8 percent of gross domestic product
in the year through March 2014 from 5.3 percent this year.
 Asia ’s third-largest economy may grow between 6.1 percent to 6.7
percent next fiscal year, from the previous period’s estimated 5
percent, a government survey showed yesterday.  “Investors are expecting a budget that will be positive
for the rupee,” said Ashtosh Raina, Mumbai-based head of
foreign-exchange trading at HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s largest
lender by market value. “There is a lot expected from the
finance minister on the fiscal and growth front.”  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent to 53.6650 per dollar as of
9:38 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 53.6050 earlier, the strongest level since Feb. 8. One-
month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 9.53 percent.  Chidambaram may curb spending growth in the budget to boost
scope for the central bank to reduce borrowing costs and avert a
credit-rating downgrade, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Lower bond yields and sovereign risk that accompanies better
public finances will mitigate the impact of an austere budget on
growth, the bank predicts.  Economic growth  slowed to 4.9 percent in the quarter
through December, according to the median of 43 estimates in a
Bloomberg survey before data due 5 p.m. in New Delhi today. That
would be the slowest pace since the three months through March
2009.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.74 per
dollar, compared with 54.99 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.63 versus 54.86. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
