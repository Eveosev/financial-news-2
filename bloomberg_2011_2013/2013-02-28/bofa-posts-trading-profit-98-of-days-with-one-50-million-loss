Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, said traders lost $50 million on
their worst trading day of 2012, a rare blemish in a year in
which the firm made money 98 percent of the time.  The lender showed a profit on 243 of the 249 trading days,
with profit exceeding $25 million during 80 percent of the
sessions, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company said today
in an annual regulatory filing. In 2011, Bank of America showed
a profit 86 percent of the time, with the largest single-day
loss of $119 million and losses topping $25 million on 12 days.  Co-chief Operating Officer Thomas K. Montag, 56, has
curtailed trading risk the past two years amid subdued economic
growth and uncertainty created by the  European debt crisis . Bank
of Americaâ€™s global markets division earned about $1 billion in
each of 2012 and 2011, compared with $4.2 billion in 2010.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. said this week that traders in its
investment bank lost money on seven days in 2012, down from 26
the previous year. Average daily revenue in the trading unit was
$69 million in 2012, up from $60 million in 2011, according to
the New York-based bank, ranked first by assets in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
