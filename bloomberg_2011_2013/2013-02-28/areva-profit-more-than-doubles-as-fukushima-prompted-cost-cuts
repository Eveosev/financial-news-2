Areva SA (AREVA) , the world’s biggest
supplier of nuclear fuel and services, reported earnings that
more than doubled in 2012 as sales rose and the company slashed
costs following the 2011 nuclear accident in  Japan .  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, excluding one-time items, rose to 1.01 billion
euros ($1.32 billion) from 421 million euros a year earlier,
Paris-based Areva said today. The net loss shrank to 99 million
euros from 2.5 billion euros as Areva sold 1.2 billion euros of
assets and booked fewer charges and writedowns.  “Areva is ahead of schedule in executing its recovery
plan,” said Chief Executive Officer Luc Oursel. The company is
“fully mobilized” to return to a break-even in operating cash
flow before tax this year, he said.  Oursel decided in December 2011 to  cut costs  by 1 billion
euros by 2015, sell assets and reduce investment to shore up a
balance sheet that had been impaired by construction delays at a
nuclear plant in  Finland , soured investments in African uranium
mines, and nuclear plant closures in countries such as Japan and
 Germany  after the nuclear facility meltdown in Fukushima.  The company’s net debt rose to 3.95 billion euros at the
end of 2012 from 3.55 billion euros a year earlier as its
operating outflow before tax and one-time items amounted to 854
million euros.  The company’s debt should be little changed at the end of
2013 as Areva targets Ebitda of more than 1.1 billion euros,
completes the sale of its nuclear measurement unit, and trims
investment, Chief Financial Officer  Pierre Auboin  told
journalists today.  Areva, controlled by the French state, invested 2.1 billion
euros in 2012 to develop uranium mines, and chemistry and
enrichment facilities. It plans to trim capital expenditure to
about 1.7 billion euros this year, and an annual average of 1.3
billion euros in the 2014 to 2016 period, the company reiterated
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
