Calpers, the largest U.S. pension
fund, is supporting calls for  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  to split the roles
of chairman and chief executive officer after  Robert Iger ’s
tenure.  The pension fund backs the Burbank, California-based
company’s board nominees, along with its executive compensation
and bonus plans, ahead of Disney’s March 6 annual meeting in
Phoenix, according to a website  statement . The fund owns 5.07
million Disney shares.  “Calpers believes if the chairman was not the CEO, the
board may be able to exercise stronger oversight of
management,” the pension fund said.  With the  votes , the  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System  sided with Calstrs, the state teachers’ fund, in the non-
binding poll on top management roles. It also backed Calstrs on
a proposal to give large investors more clout in director
nominations. Calpers isn’t opposing the company’s board
nominees, as the other fund has.  Disney, which has defended its governance and cited the
company’s industry-leading returns, gained 0.2 percent to $54.59
at the close in New York. The stock has advanced 9.6 percent
this year.  “Disney’s performance during Mr. Iger’s tenure has been
nothing short of spectacular,” the company in a statement this
week, citing a 76 percent shareholder return in the year that
ended in September. “Disney has delivered results that speak
for themselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
