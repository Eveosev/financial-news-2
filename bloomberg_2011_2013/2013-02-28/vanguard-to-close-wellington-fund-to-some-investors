Vanguard Group Inc., the world’s
biggest mutual-fund company, said two funds including the $68
billion Vanguard Wellington Fund won’t open new accounts for
financial advisers and institutional investors.  The Wellington fund and the $39 billion Intermediate-Term
Tax-Exempt Fund will remain open to new retail clients and to
deposits from all existing clients, the Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania-based company said today in a statement. The
Wellington fund is Vanguard’s biggest actively run fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
