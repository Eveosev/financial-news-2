ProShares, a provider of exchange-
traded funds specializing in  alternative investments , started an
ETF designed to track the performance of companies that invest
in private equity.  ProShares Global Listed Private Equity ETF (PEX) , which debuted
today, tracks an index of companies whose primary business is
direct investments in private equity, the Bethesda, Maryland-
based firm said today in a press release. The index, the LPX
Direct Listed Private Equity Index, is a portfolio of as many as
30 firms and excludes companies whose primary business is
private-equity fund management.  The new ETF “offers access to global private equity with
the liquidity, transparency and cost effectiveness of an ETF,”
ProShares Chief Executive Officer Michael L. Sapir, said in the
release.  ProShares had 139 ETFs with $21.9 billion in assets as of
Jan. 31, according to Boston-based  State Street Corp. (STT)  ETFs
typically track indexes and trade throughout the day like
stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
