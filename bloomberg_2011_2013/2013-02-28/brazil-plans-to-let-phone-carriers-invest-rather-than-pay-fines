Brazilian phone and television
carriers would be able to commit to invest more in their
networks rather than paying fines for regulatory violations
under a plan being readied by the government’s
telecommunications agency.  Anatel, as the regulator is known, plans to vote on the
proposal March 7, Joao Rezende, the agency’s president, said in
a phone interview from Barcelona. The measure would only be
applied to new fines issued by  Anatel , and the sanctions would
double if companies failed to comply with their agreements to
increase investments, he said.  “The sooner a company acknowledges and corrects a mistake,
the bigger a discount in the fine,” Rezende said.  The proposal is the latest step by Anatel to balance its
tougher scrutiny of the industry with incentives for companies
to invest more in their networks. Last year, when the agency
announced a plan to reduce fees companies can charge, it also
granted carriers a nine-year “holiday” on new fiber-optic
infrastructure, saying they wouldn’t have to share their new
networks with rivals during that period.  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , Brazil’s biggest cable-TV provider and
its third-largest mobile-phone carrier, slid less than 1 percent
to 13.37 pesos in Mexico City. Telefonica Brasil SA, the
nation’s largest wireless company, fell less than 1 percent to
52.14 reais in Sao Paulo.  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , the second-largest mobile-phone
company, dropped less than 1 percent to 8.65 reais, and  Oi SA (OIBR4) ,
the biggest landline carrier, fell 1.5 percent to 7.35 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
