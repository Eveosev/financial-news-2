U.K. stocks  rose, with the benchmark
index completing its ninth monthly gain, as European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  signaled they will continue to support their respective
economies.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  jumped to a
19-month high as the parent of British Airways reported a
narrower loss than analysts had predicted.  National Express
Group Plc (NEX)  posted the biggest gain on the region’s benchmark
Stoxx Europe 600 Index after posting better-than-estimated
profit.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  slid the most in eight
months after reporting a wider loss.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  advanced 34.93 points, or 0.6 percent,
to 6,360.81 at the close of trading in London. The gauge rallied
1.3 percent in February, for its longest streak of monthly gains
since May 1997. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also rose 0.6
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.9 percent.  “There seems to be a positive tone in the markets today,”
said Espen Furnes, who helps oversee $75 billion as  fund manager 
at Storebrand Asset Management in Oslo. “The markets are just
not that concerned about the consequences of the U.S. budget
cuts this time around. And no news from the ECB and Fed is good
news as it means the current stimulus will continue for now.”  Draghi indicated the ECB won’t tighten monetary policy any
time soon. While the ECB’s balance sheet may shrink as
confidence returns to financial markets and banks repay
emergency loans, policy makers are far from considering an exit
from stimulus, Draghi said at an event in Munich late yesterday.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S., Bernanke discussed the possibility of altering
the Fed’s exit strategy by delaying asset sales. The central
bank can hold bonds on its $3.1 trillion balance sheet to
maturity, he said.  “The one thing we could do differently” is “hold some of
the securities a little longer,” Bernanke said in response to
questions from members of the House Financial Services
Committee. “We could even let them just run off.”  In  Japan , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe nominated Asian
Development Bank President Haruhiko Kuroda to head the  Bank of
Japan . Kuroda advocated an inflation target more than a decade
before the central bank adopted one in January, and said this
month that additional easing can be justified for 2013.  IAG rallied 7.9 percent to 239.2 pence after  posting  an
adjusted operating loss of 23 million euros ($30 million) for
2012, compared with the 88 million-euro loss predicted by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  National Express  National Express , the U.K. coach and train operator, surged
13 percent to 220 pence after reporting 2012 pretax profit of

of 154 million pounds.  ITV Plc (ITV)  advanced 4.4 percent to 124.2 pence. The owner of
the U.K.’s biggest commercial TV station plans to pay a special
dividend for a total amount of 156 million pounds after profit
