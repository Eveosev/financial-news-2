British Airways (IAG)  parent International
Consolidated Airlines Group SA pledged to push through a plan to
shrink Spanish division Iberia by 15 percent and deliver a profit
rebound this year following a group-wide loss in 2012.  Iberia, where workers are staging strikes over as many as
3,807 job cuts, “must adapt to survive,” IAG Chief Executive
Officer Willie Walsh said today. Unions engaged in non-binding
mediation talks have until March 12 to reach a deal, he said.  Europe ’s third-largest carrier had an operating loss of 23
million euros ($30 million) in 2012, excluding one-time items,
versus earnings of 485 million euros a year earlier. While that
beat estimates thanks to a 347 million-euro profit at British
Airways, spurring the stock to its biggest gain since July 30,
the result was undermined by Iberia’s 351 million-euro loss.  “This is all about the core unacceptable performance of
Iberia which must be tackled in a permanent and structural way,”
Walsh said on a conference call. Losses at the unit, where the
Irishman is seeking a 600 million-euro earnings turnaround by
2015, go “well beyond”  Spain ’s economic woes, he said.  Profit Target  Shares of London-based IAG rose as much as 6.8 percent to
236.70 pence and were trading at 233.20 pence as of 10:12 a.m.
in the U.K. capital. The stock has added 26 percent this year,
valuing the group at 4.33 billion pounds ($6.6 billion).  That compares with a 15 percent gain at  Air France-KLM
Group (AF) , Europe’s biggest airline, which last week posted a 300
million-euro full-year operating loss.  “We see  Willie Walsh  winning the battle on driving the
required turnaround,” James Hollins, an analyst at Investec in
 London  with a “buy” recommendation on the stock, said in a note
to investors. IAG had been expected to post an 88 million-euro
loss, based on seven estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  IAG said today it’s expecting an operating result this year
that will beat 2011’s 485 million-euro profit, excluding any
further Iberia-related hits from additional restructuring that
Walsh said is under consideration. The company booked a 202
million-euro restructuring cost against the Madrid-based unit in
2012, plus a 343 million-euro impairment charge.  Express Gains  Walsh said that a lower figure of 3,147 given for firings
is the total that might be viable if linked to productivity
gains and other measures, and he declined to say if the figure
represents a minimum acceptable level of cuts. Strikes at
Iberia, which commenced last week and continue next month, are
meanwhile costing the airline about 3 million euros a day.  The Spanish overhaul includes the transfer of some domestic
and short-haul flights to Iberia Express, which was established
last year with less-generous employee contracts and posted a
profit for 2012. That “stunning” performance “shows what can
be done with the right focus,” according to the CEO.  IAG has also made a bid for the 54 percent of Barcelona-
based  Vueling Airlines SA (VLG)  it doesn’t already own in a further
move to lower costs in the country. Vueling almost tripled its
net income to 28.3 million euros in 2012 as the passenger total
climbed 20 percent to 14.8 million, it said yesterday.  IAG’s revenue rose 11 percent to 18.1 billion euros in 2012
after passenger traffic, or the number of customers times the
distance flown, gained 4.4 percent, with a jump of 7.7 percent
at British Airways versus a 3.1 percent contraction at Iberia.  BMI Boost  Excluding the purchase of BMI from  Germany ’s  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  on April 20, which added money-spinning flights at
BA’s London Heathrow hub, company-wide traffic rose 2.6 percent.
The passenger total increased 5.6 percent to 54.6 million.  Savings from the 2011 merger of British Airways and Iberia
which formed IAG reached 313 million euros last year, beating a
target of 225 million euros. Still, revenue and cost synergies
alone are not enough, Walsh said, and must “go hand in hand with
permanent structural change.”  British Airways will seek to boost margins on key routes
this year as it adds the  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner and the
Airbus SAS A380 superjumbo, phasing out less efficient planes.  Dreamliner deliveries, due from May, will likely be delayed
as the manufacturer tries to fix a battery fault that grounded
the fleet on Jan. 16, Walsh said, adding that Boeing 767s will
remain in service if necessary, with no network impact. “I
believe Boeing will resolve the technical issues,” he said.  Plans for the A380 remain on track, with an announcement
imminent on destinations to be served by the new flagship.  BA also began offering hand-luggage only tickets last week
with a fare discount of 9 pounds to 15 pounds, available to five
destinations from London’s Gatwick airport. The step, which
consumer groups said amounts to charging for checked bags, will
help IAG compete with discount airlines such as  EasyJet Plc. (EZJ)   Sustained budget uncertainty in the U.S. is a concern, the
CEO said, and while the planned merger of IAG’s partner  American
Airlines  with US Airways Group Inc. is a positive, benefits will
not accrue this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
