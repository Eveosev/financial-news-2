CGG (CGG) , the largest seismic surveyor of
oilfields, fell the most in more than a year in Paris trading as
profit margins at its  Sercel  equipment-supply unit shrank.  CGG dropped 8.8 percent to 19.02 euros, the biggest one-day
decline since September 2011, valuing the company at 3.4 billion
euros ($4.5 billion). Trading volumes were more than five times
the three-month daily average.  Sercelâ€™s margin on earnings narrowed to 28 percent in the
fourth quarter from 30 percent a year earlier as revenue slumped
12 percent, the Paris-based company said today in a statement.
It expects the margin to hold steady this year before returning
to 30 percent in 2014.  The decline resulted in part from increased competition and
higher costs for research and development, Credit Agricole
Cheuvreux SA said in a note. The margin missed a 32 percent
estimate, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
