Dumith Fernando,  Credit Suisse Group
AG (CSGN) ’s chief operating officer for the Asia-Pacific region, is
leaving  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Andrew Morgan, global head of tax and chief financial
officer for Asia-Pacific, will assume Fernando’s role
immediately, the people said, asking not to be identified
because the departure hasn’t been publicly announced. Morgan
will have the COO title in addition to his current
responsibilities, the people said.  Fernando couldn’t be reached to comment on his departure.  Fernando joined Credit Suisse in 2007 and was appointed
regional COO in late 2010 by Osama Abbasi, the bank’s former
chief executive officer for Asia-Pacific who left in November
amid a global restructuring. His departure follows that of
Olivier Thiriet, former head of Asia-Pacific cash equities, and
George Lin, who ran consumer, retail and health-care investment
banking for  Asia .  Thiriet and Lin will join Bank of America Corp. later this
year, people with knowledge of the matter said this week.  Credit Suisse this month raised its target for cost
reductions for a third time in seven months as it posted fourth-
quarter earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates. The
bank said on Feb. 7 it will seek an additional 400 million Swiss
francs ($430 million) in cost savings by the end of 2015, on top
of 4 billion francs in planned cuts announced since 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
