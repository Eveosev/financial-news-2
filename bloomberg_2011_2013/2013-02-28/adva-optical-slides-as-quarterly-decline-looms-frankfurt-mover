Adva Optical Networking SE fell the
most since October in Frankfurt trading after the German maker
of fiber networks predicted a first-quarter sales decline and
said it may have to book charges.  The stock of the Martinsried-based company dropped as much
as 15 percent, and traded down 8.5 percent at 4.10 euros as of
10 a.m. Volume was more than four times the daily three-month
average after an hour of trading.  Adva has seen revenue and profitability drop as phone
companies cut back spending on fixed-line networks, shifting to
investments in faster wireless transmission technology. The
companyâ€™s  largest customers  are  BT Group Plc (BT/A) ,  Time Warner Cable
Inc. (TWC)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter net income dropped to 4.1 million
euros ($5.4 million) from 8.7 million euros a year earlier.  Adva is performing a review of its intangible assets, which
may lead to impairment charges in the first quarter and beyond,
the company said today.  It forecast revenue of 72 million euros to 77 million euros
in the first three months of 2013, lower than the 80.3 million
euros it reported in the fourth quarter and down from 81.7
million euros a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
