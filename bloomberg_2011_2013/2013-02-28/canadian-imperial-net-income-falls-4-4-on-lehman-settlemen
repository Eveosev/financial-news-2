Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ,
the country’s fifth-biggest bank, said first-quarter profit fell
4.4 percent after paying $150 million to settle a lawsuit with
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s estate.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 was C$798 million
($780 million), or C$1.91 a share, compared with C$835 million,
or C$1.93, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said today in
a statement. Revenue rose 0.8 percent to C$3.18 billion from
C$3.16 billion.  Earnings were eroded by the settlement with the Lehman
estate to end a two-year-old legal dispute over collateralized
debt obligation deals. Canadian Imperial said Dec. 31 that the
after-tax cost of the settlement is $110 million. Excluding the
cost and other items, CIBC said it earned C$2.15 a share,
beating the C$2.09 a share average  estimate  of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s largest lender,
 Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the second-largest lender, and  National
Bank of Canada , the sixth-biggest lender, also report today.  (CIBC will hold a conference call to discuss results at
