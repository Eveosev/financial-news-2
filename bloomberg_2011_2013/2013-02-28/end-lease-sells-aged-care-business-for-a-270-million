Lend Lease Group (LLC) , Australia’s
biggest property developer, agreed to sell its elderly care
business for A$270 million ($276 million) to a company linked to
buyout firm  Archer Capital .  The developer will sell the business, which owns and
manages 30 facilities across the nation, to Australian Aged Care
Partners, which is controlled by funds managed or advised by
Sydney-based Archer,  Lend Lease  said in a filing today. The
company will receive a cash payment of A$200 million and a
promissory note for A$70 million, it said. It will continue to
own and operate retirement villages, McCann said.  Lend Lease took over the unit, which provides assisted
living facilities for the elderly, then called Primelife Group,
in December 2009, paying 35 Australian cents a share for the
parts it didn’t already own. That was equivalent to about A$170
million, the Age newspaper reported on Dec. 15, 2009. The sale
of the business announced today is part of the company’s
strategy of divesting “non-core” assets, Chief Executive
Officer Steve McCann said in the statement today.  “The aged care business is more closely aligned to health-
care services than property and is therefore considered non-core
for Lend Lease,” McCann said in the statement. “Lend Lease
will use the sale proceeds to continue to deliver its core
development pipeline in  Australia .”  The sale is expected to be finalized by the end of March,
the company said.  Sydney-based Lend Lease this month reported a 39 percent
increase in profit in the six months to Dec. 31.  The  shares  rose 0.9 percent to A$10.73 as of 11 a.m. in
Sydney, extending this year’s gain to 16 percent. That compares
with a 9.1 percent advance for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
