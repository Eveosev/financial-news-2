Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA ,
Peru’s biggest precious-metals producer, said fourth-quarter
profit dropped 39 percent, missing analysts’ estimates.  Net income fell to $139.1 million, or 54 cents a share,
from $227.9 million, or 90 cents, a year earlier, Lima-based
Buenaventura said today in an e-mailed statement. Analysts
expected profit of 67 cents a share excluding one-time items,
the  average  of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Buenaventura’s stakes in  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) ’s Yanacocha
gold mine and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Cerro Verde
copper mine contributed less to the company’s earnings on lower
sales volume and rising expenses, said Inteligo SAB analyst Lali
Merino, who doesn’t own Buenaventura shares and rates the stock
a hold.  “Their subsidiaries accounted for substantially less
revenue this quarter,” Merino said in a telephone interview
from Lima before the report was released. “Metals prices
weren’t a factor.”  New York-traded copper and silver futures rose 5 percent
and 1 percent, respectively, while gold gained 2 percent in the
period.  Newmont’s Yanacocha mine, in which Buenaventura holds a 44
percent stake, contributed $32.4 million, down 63 percent from a
year earlier. Income from Buenaventura’s 18 percent stake in
 Cerro Verde (CVERDEC1)  fell 28 percent to $28.6 million.  Falling Production  Revenue rose 5 percent to $424.2 million. Gold production
fell 22 percent to 211,448 ounces, while zinc doubled and lead
climbed 68 percent, Buenaventura said. Silver output rose 12
percent to 4.59 million ounces.  Expenses rose 32 percent to $21.6 million.  Gold futures for April delivery fell 1.1 percent to settle
at settle at $1,578.10 an ounce today on the Comex in New York.
Silver declined 1.9 percent to $28.395.  The report was released after the close of regular trading
today. Buenaventura’s American depositary receipts, each
representing one ordinary share, dropped 24 cents, or 0.9
percent, to close at $25.62 in New York. The ADRs have dropped
28.7 percent this year.  (Buenaventura is scheduled to have its quarterly conference
