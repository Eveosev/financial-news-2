Siemens First Capital Commercial
Finance LLC won dismissal of a lawsuit accusing it of breach of
contract over the cancellation of an initial public offering for
a security-alarm service business.  Whitecap (US) Fund I LP sued Siemens First Capital in  New
York  state court in March 2012, accusing it of “intentionally
destroying” three related companies that planned a public
offering. Whitecap, the majority owner of the three companies,
said Siemens told it the companies defaulted on an $85 million
loan because the IPO hadn’t been completed by March 1, 2011.  Justice O. Peter Sherwood in an order dated Feb. 21
dismissed the suit, saying that the decision to wind down the
alarm companies after the failure to meet the deadline is
“consistent with the agreement of the parties” to convert one
of the companies into a single-purpose entity in order to sell
its assets.  Siemens First Capital Commercial Finance is a joint venture
between the U.S. financial services unit of Munich-based
engineering company  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  Boca Raton , Florida-based
financial firm First Capital, according to its website.  The case is Whitecap (US) Fund I LP v. Siemens First
Capital Commercial Finance LLC, 650888/2012, New York state
Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
