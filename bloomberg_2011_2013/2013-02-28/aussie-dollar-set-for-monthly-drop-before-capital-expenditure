Australia’s dollar rallied, erasing
earlier losses, as traders pared bets the central bank will cut
its key  interest rate  after data showed companies will continue
to invest into next year.  The so-called Aussie dropped earlier after figures showed
capital spending unexpectedly fell last quarter. New Zealand’s
dollar strengthened after global stocks rallied and local data
showed business confidence improved and building approvals
decreased less than economists estimated. The yield on
Australia’s 10-year debt rose from a five-week low.  “The information in the capital expenditure report is not
enough to trigger a rate cut next week,” said  Annette Beacher ,
Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities
Inc. “The first piece of information was a weaker-than expected
December quarter. The second piece of information we noticed was
that 2013-2014 was stronger than expected. The Aussie seemed to
have settled back at a slightly higher level after a violent
movement.”  The Australian dollar added 0.4 percent to $1.0278 as of
4:26 p.m. in Sydney, after earlier falling as much as 0.4
percent. It touched $1.0184 yesterday, the lowest since Oct. 10.
The Aussie jumped 0.6 percent to 94.93 yen. New Zealand’s dollar
advanced 0.5 percent to 83.18 U.S. cents. The so-called kiwi
rose 0.7 percent to 76.84 yen.  For the month, Australia’s currency was set for a 1.4
percent drop versus the  U.S. dollar . New Zealand’s dollar was
poised for a 0.8 percent decline.  Australian Yield  Australian companies forecast they will spend A$152.5
billion ($156.8 billion) in 2013-14, compared with an estimated
A$168.2 billion in 2012-2013, the Bureau of Statistics said
today in Sydney. Fourth-quarter  capital spending  fell 1.2
percent from the previous three-month period, when it rose a
revised 1.1 percent. The median estimate of economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News  was for a 1 percent increase.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 20 percent chance the central bank will lower its
benchmark to 2.75 percent at the next meeting on March 5. That
compares with 33 percent chance indicated yesterday.  “The RBA has an easing bias, but it doesn’t seem to have
the desire to ease in the near term,” said Bill Diviney, Tokyo-
based currency strategist at Barclays Plc. The decline in
 capital spending  last quarter “wouldn’t be enough to change the
RBA’s stance.”  The  yield  on Australia’s 10-year bonds rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.35 percent from yesterday,
when it touched 3.33 percent, the lowest since Jan. 25. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 1.4 percent, following a 1
percent jump by the MSCI World Index yesterday.  Aussie Overvalued  The RBA estimated in August that most models including
those used by the central bank and  International Monetary Fund ,
suggested the local dollar could be 4 percent to 15 percent
overvalued, according to a document for its September board
meeting released today in response to a Freedom of Information
Act request by Bloomberg News.  Governor  Glenn Stevens  acknowledged last week that the
currency was “somewhat too high,” while saying he’d need to be
confident the currency is “seriously overvalued” before
considering intervention to weaken it.  “The report was from last year, so it’s not the RBA’s
current view,” said  Joseph Capurso , a Sydney-based foreign-
exchange strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “This
doesn’t mean the RBA is going to start intervening in the
 exchange rate .”  The National Bank of New Zealand’s business confidence
index rose to 39.4 from a month earlier. Permits for dwellings
fell 0.4 percent to 1,557 in January from 1,564 in December,
 Statistics New Zealand  said in Wellington today. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had forecast a 2 percent drop.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
