The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 3.5 basis
points to 114 basis points as of 10:29 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac
Banking Corp. prices show. The benchmark, which has ranged from
110.2 basis points to 127.5 this year, is set to decline 5.5
basis points this month, data provider CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  declined 2 basis points to 107 as of
8:36 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Plc prices show.
The gauge, which has ranged from 102.8 to 120.3 since Dec. 31,
is on course to decline 9.2 basis points in February, according
to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2 basis points to 125
basis points as of 9:11 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices. The measure, which started the year at 148.1, is
poised for a 10.2 basis-point decline this month, CMA prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
