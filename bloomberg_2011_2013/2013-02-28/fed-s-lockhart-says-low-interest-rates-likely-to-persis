President  Dennis Lockhart  said near-zero interest rates are
likely to persist for “some time.”  “It is fair to continue to predict we will have a low
interest-rate environment for some time,” Lockhart said today
in a speech at the Atlanta Fed. That will be a challenge for
U.S. banks, which will have “tight” margins from lower net
interest income, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
