Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , the world’s largest
soft-drink maker, sold $2.5 billion of bonds in its first
offering in almost a year.  The producer of Sprite and Dasani water issued $500 million
of floating-rate debt maturing in two years to yield 2 basis
points less than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also sold $1.25
billion of 1.15 percent, five year-debt to yield 45 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $750 million of 2.5
percent, 10-year bonds at a relative yield of 67 basis points.  The bonds are rated Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, AA-
by Standard & Poor’s and A+ by Fitch Ratings, the ratings
companies said today in separate statements.  Proceeds will be used to redeem all of the company’s 5
percent notes due in August, 7.375 percent securities maturing
in 2014 and 4.25 percent debentures due 2015, as well as for
general corporate purposes, the Atlanta-based beverages maker
said today in a regulatory filing.  The sale follows a $2.5 billion issue from  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)  on
Feb. 25, in which the world’s largest snack-food maker sold
$1.25 billion of 10-year debt yielding 2.76 percent, 21 basis
points above the 2.55 percent yield on Coca-Cola’s April 2023
debt issued today, Bloomberg data show. Moody’s rates the
PepsiCo bond Aa3, the same as the Coca-Cola issue. S&P grades
PepsiCo’s securities at A-, or three levels lower.  Prior Sale  Coca-Cola previously sold debt in March 2012, issuing $1
billion each of two-year floaters to yield 5 basis points less
than Libor and 0.75 percent, three-year securities to yield 35
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg
data show.  The bonds due in March 2015 traded at 100.8 cents on the
dollar to yield 0.36 percent, or a 12.2 basis-point spread,
yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system
of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and
Morgan Stanley managed today’s offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
