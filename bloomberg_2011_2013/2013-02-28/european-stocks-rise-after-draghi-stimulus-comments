European (SXXP)  stocks climbed, with the
benchmark index rising for a ninth straight month, as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  and Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  signaled they would maintain monetary support.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  increased to the highest price in more than a
month after saying sales will rise 4 percent to 5 percent this
year. Telefonica SA added 2 percent as Spain’s biggest phone
company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc slid to its lowest level
in two months after posting a wider full-year loss.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 1 percent to 289.94 at
the close of trading, extending its advance this month to 1
percent, for its longest monthly winning streak since 1997. The
benchmark has risen 3.7 percent this year as U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a budget avoiding automatic fiscal changes that had
threatened to push the world’s biggest economy into recession.  “Thanks to a strong mix of positive business results and
signals of central banks remaining expansive, the upward trend
on equity markets is strengthened and may continue,” said
Daniel Gschwend, portfolio manager at Diem Client Partner AG in
Zurich, which oversees more than 1 billion Swiss francs ($1.08
billion) in assets. “Looking at this long winning streak,
however, I expect a substantial correction will soon be
needed.”  No Tightening  Draghi signaled the bank has no intention of tightening
monetary policy anytime soon with inflation projected to
“significantly” undershoot its 2 percent target next year.  While the ECB’s balance sheet may shrink naturally as
confidence returns to financial markets and banks repay
emergency loans, policy makers are far from considering an exit
from monetary stimulus, Draghi said at an event in Munich late
yesterday.  Bernanke yesterday defended record stimulus to Congress,
saying accommodation has helped reduce borrowing costs and spur
growth. He also said the central bank may decide to hold bonds
on its $3.1 trillion balance sheet to maturity as part of a
review of its strategy for an exit from record monetary easing.  A Labor Department report showed that fewer Americans filed
applications for  unemployment benefits  last week. Initial

quarter. Gross domestic product grew at a 0.1 percent annual

figures from the Commerce Department showed today in  Washington .
The median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a 0.5 percent gain.  Italian Coalition  Italy is headed for a broad coalition government as
bondholders pressure Pier Luigi Bersani and  Silvio Berlusconi  to
set aside their rivalries and form a partnership, said Finance
Undersecretary Gianfranco Polillo.  National benchmark indexes rose in all of the 18 western-
European markets except  Portugal  today. France’s CAC 40 and
Germany’s DAX both added 0.9 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100
climbed 0.6 percent.  Bayer increased 2.7 percent to 75.86 euros after saying
sales will rise to about 41 billion euros ($53.9 billion) this
year. Fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, amortization and special items increased 18
percent to 1.83 billion euros from 1.54 billion euros a year
earlier, in line with analysts’ estimates.  Telefonica Beats  Telefonica (TEF)  added 20 cents to 10 euros after reporting
fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as sales
growth in  Latin America  helped to offset revenue declines in its
domestic market. Operating income before depreciation and
amortization fell 8.6 percent to 5.45 billion euros, compared
with projections for 5.44 billion euros.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  gained 0.9 percent to 731.4 pence.

million-euro loss.  RBS Loss  RBS (RBS)  slid 6.6 percent to 323.9 pence. Britain’s biggest
taxpayer-owned lender posted a wider full-year loss after it set
aside a further 1.1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) to compensate
clients wrongly sold insurance and swaps. The net loss swelled
to 5.97 billion pounds from 2 billion pounds in the year-earlier
period, missing the average 5.1 billion-pound analyst estimate.  A gauge of mining-linked companies posted the  second-worst
performance  on the Stoxx 600, with Anglo American Plc and
