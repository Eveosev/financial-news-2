The European Union’s top banking and
markets regulators warned inexperienced investors that they may
lose more money than they expect when trading contracts for
difference.  Volatile markets, combined with extra leverage, “can
result in rapid changes to your overall investment position,”
the  European Banking Authority  and  European Securities and
Markets Authority  said in a joint statement on the EBA’s
website.  The contracts are only appropriate for people who have
“extensive experience in trading, in particular during volatile
markets, and can afford any losses,” the EBA said.  A contract for difference is an agreement between a buyer
and a seller to exchange the difference between the current
price of an asset such as shares, currencies or commodities, and
its price when the contract is closed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
