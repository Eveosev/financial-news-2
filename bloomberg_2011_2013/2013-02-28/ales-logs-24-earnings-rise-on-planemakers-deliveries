Thales SA (HO) , Europe’s biggest defense
electronics maker, posted a 24 percent increase in 2012 earnings
buoyed by higher deliveries of Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA) 
airliners, for which it supplies avionics.  Earnings before interest and tax, including a 35 percent
holding in warship maker DCNS, rose to 927 million euros ($1.2
billion) from 749 million euros, the company said today in a
statement. The increase was driven by a 37 percent jump in
earnings from the commercial aerospace business and cost cutting
introduced by its former management.  The full-year results are the first under Chief Executive
Officer  Jean-Bernard Levy , who was tapped in late December to
succeed Luc Vigneron, who was ousted by primary shareholders
 Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  and the French state. Operating margins
rose to 6.5 percent from 5.7 percent a year ago.  Sales this year should remain stable, with growth in civil
activities offsetting a less favorable situation in defense,
Thales said.  “A continuing drive to improve performance should enable
the group to post a further increase in Ebit,” with a target of
8 percent operating margins, the company said.  The company said it would propose a dividend of 88 cents,
an increase of 13 percent compared with 2011, Thales said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
