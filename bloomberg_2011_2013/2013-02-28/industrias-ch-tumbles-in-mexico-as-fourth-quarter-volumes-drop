Industrias CH SAB (ICHB) , Mexico’s largest
steelmaker, fell the most in a week after fourth-quarter profit
and sales volumes declined.  The stock fell 1.9 percent to 102.69 pesos at 11:37 a.m. in
Mexico City. The country’s benchmark IPC stock index rose 0.3
percent.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 97 percent to 28.9 million
pesos from a year earlier, according to a filing with the
Mexican stock exchange. Sales tonnage for the Tlalnepantla-based
company fell 9 percent from a year earlier.  The results were “weaker than expected,” Rodrigo Garcilazo, an analyst with  Corporativo GBM SAB (GBMO)  said in a report
dated today.  The fourth-quarter “was the peak of the destocking cycle
in the U.S.,” Garcilazo, who rates the stock the equivalent of
sell, said in the report. “Volumes should recover in the coming
months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
