Chicago  gasoline fell to the lowest
level against futures in almost seven weeks as refineries in the
region boosted processing and area inventories rose for a  second
week .  Refiners in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,  processed  3.41
million barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 22, an increase of
3.4 percent from the previous seven days. That was 2.6 percent
above the  five-year  average and the biggest increase since
November, according to Energy Information Administration data.
Regional  supplies  gained 272,000 barrels to 53.6 million last
week, the data show.  “We saw a wild return of refinery utilization in the
Midwest,” Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC said. The increase may be
a result of  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  returning its Toledo, Ohio, refinery
to normal operations after a fire in late January, according to
the New York-based industry report.  The discount for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in Chicago slid 8.5 cents to  32.5 cents  a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:03 p.m., the
widest gap since Jan. 11.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in the region
slipped 2.75 cents to a premium of 10.5 cents a gallon above
heating oil futures.  PBF’s 175,000-barrel-a-day Toledo plant shut a fluid
catalytic cracker and cut rates at some process units after a
fire broke out near the end of January. The plant returned to
normal operations last week, the company said.  Refiner Profits  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and diesel based on West Texas
Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , slumped $1.09 to $30.05 a
barrel. The  same spread  gained $1.52 to $30.77 a barrel on the
Gulf Coast, while the gap for Light Louisiana Sweet in the
region rose $1.37 to $10.22 a barrel.  Conventional gasoline  on the U.S. Gulf Coast tumbled 21.75
cent to a discount of 25 cents as trading spreads switched to
April futures. Reformulated gasoline dropped 1 cent to trade at
a discount of 4.5 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Refiners processed  7.32 million barrels  of crude and other
feedstock last week, up from 7.14 million in the week-earlier
period, according to EIA data. That was the first gain in
refinery rates in four weeks.  “A sizable increase in utilization resulted in in a net
increase in regional runs,” according to a note from CIBC World
Markets Inc., a financial services firm. Most notable was the
return of Sweeny from planned maintenance, the note said.  Refineries  utilized  almost 84 percent of capacity, compared
with 82 percent in the previous time period, according to EIA
data reported yesterday.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Sweeny, Texas, refinery was in the process of
restarting units after scheduled maintenance that began Jan. 7,
according to two people familiar with the operations, who asked
not to be identified because the information isn’t public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
