United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Pratt &
Whitney unit has recommended that the Pentagon lift a flight
suspension that grounded the F-35 fighter fleet over a cracked
engine blade.  The Defense Department’s F-35 program office “is currently
assessing our recommendation to return the fleet to flight,”
Pratt & Whitney spokesman Matthew Bates said today in an e-mail.  The Pentagon said Feb. 22 that it suspended all flights of
 Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 after a routine engine inspection
revealed a crack on a turbine blade in a test aircraft engine at
Edwards Air Force Base in  California . Pratt & Whitney makes the
engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, the costliest U.S. weapon
system.  The Pentagon and the military services are reviewing the
recommendation, according to Kyra Hawn, a spokeswoman for the
F-35 program office.  Military flight experts will determine after an analysis of
the Pratt & Whitney data “how and when to restore ground and
flight operations,” she said.  The blade in question was in an engine “subjected to more
flight hours and wear than aircraft of comparable age,” Hawn
said.  Cost estimates for the F-35 have ballooned to $395.7
billion, a 70 percent increase since 2001. The aircraft program
may face cutbacks because of sequestration, the across-the-board
 federal budget  reductions scheduled to begin taking effect
tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
