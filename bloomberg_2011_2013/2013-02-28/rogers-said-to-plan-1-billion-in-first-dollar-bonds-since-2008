Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  Canada ’s
largest wireless carrier, sold $1 billion of debt in its first
U.S. offering in more than four years.  The communications and media company issued $500 million
each of 3 percent, 10-year securities to yield 113 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries and 4.5 percent, 30-
year debt at a relative yield of 145 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The senior unsecured notes may be rated Baa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, according to a person familiar with the
transaction who asked not to be identified because the terms are
private.  Rogers previously sold U.S. dollar-denominated notes in
July 2008, issuing $1.4 billion of 6.8 percent, 10-year
securities and $350 million of 7.5 percent, 30-year debt,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds due August 2038 traded at 137.7
cents on the dollar to yield 4.89 percent on Feb. 19, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, the
Toronto-based company said today in a U.S. regulatory filing.
Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the
offering, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
