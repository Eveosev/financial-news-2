Steven Spielberg  is to head this
year’s jury at the  Cannes Film Festival , the world’s biggest
movie competition, from May 15 to 26.  Spielberg had “accepted in principle” two years ago and
was free to take on the role this year, the festival’s general
delegate Thierry Fremaux said in an e-mailed announcement by the
organizers.  “For over six decades, Cannes has served as a platform for
extraordinary films to be discovered and introduced to the world
for the first time,” Spielberg said in the release. “The most
prestigious of its kind, the festival has always established the
motion picture as a cross-cultural and generational medium.”  Spielberg -- director of “Jaws” (1975), “Raiders of the
Lost Ark” (1981) and “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982) --
was most recently on the big screens with the biographical
picture “Lincoln.” The movie led actor Daniel Day-Lewis to
break records by winning the third best-actor Oscar of his
lifetime.  Last year’s jury was led by Italian filmmaker Nanni
Moretti.  This year’s festival is the 66th of its kind. The first
Cannes Festival took place in 1946, a year after World War II
ended. Among the event’s earliest award winners were directors
 Orson Welles ,  Luis Bunuel ,  Ingmar Bergman  and Satyajit Ray.  To contact the reporter on the story:
