JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s traders lost
money on two days during the fourth quarter, down from 10 in the
prior three months, as the largest  U.S. bank  stabilized a wrong-
way bet on  credit derivatives .  Losses occurred on 41 days in 2012, compared with 27 days
in the prior year, New York-based JPMorgan said in a securities
filing today. The firm made money on 220 out of 261 trading
days, earning more than $200 million on eight days, the bank
said.  Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , 56, ousted traders and
managers and replaced senior managers after the firm’s chief
investment office had more than $6.2 billion in losses last year
in the so-called London Whale episode. The unit, assigned to
invest the bank’s idle cash until needed, amassed a portfolio of
credit derivatives that generated the company’s biggest trading
loss ever.  The errant trade caused value-at-risk, or VaR, which
measures the most the bank might lose on 95 percent of trading
days, to surge 50.5 percent to $152 million in 2012 from an
average of $101 million in the same period last year.  The results aren’t directly comparable because the firm
changed its model twice in 2012 in an attempt to improve
accuracy.  Morgan Stanley  The botched bets prompted the retirement in May of Chief
Investment Officer Ina Drew, spurred lawsuits from shareholders
and drew civil and criminal probes by at least three U.S.
agencies.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, said that traders lost $50 million on their worst
trading day of 2012, a year in which the firm made money 98
percent of the time.  The bank showed a profit on 243 of the 249 trading days,
with profit exceeding $25 million during 80 percent of the
sessions, the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based company said today
in a regulatory filing. In 2011, Bank of America showed a profit
86 percent of the time, with the largest single-day loss of $119
million and losses topping $25 million on 12 days.  Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s biggest brokerage,
lost money in its trading businesses on 37 days last year, down
from 64 days in 2011 and the fewest since 2007. The bank’s
traders lost money on 10 days in the fourth quarter, up from
eight in the third quarter, the New York-based company said Feb.
26 in a filing.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  made more than $100 million on 23
days in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
