The U.S. Northeast from upstate  New
York  to the Canadian Maritimes may be warmer than normal by mid-
March while the center of both countries cools, MDA Weather
Services predicts.  Temperatures from New York to southern Maine, including
Boston, may be 3 to 4 degrees Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.2 Celsius)
above normal from March 10 to March 14, according to  MDA  in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. Northern Maine, eastern  Quebec  and the
Maritime Provinces may reach 5 to 7 degrees above the norm.  The area from central  Canada  through the U.S. Midwest and
Great Plains to northern  Texas  may be 3 to 7 degrees cooler than
usual during the same period, MDA said.  March 1 is the start of meteorological spring in the
Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of the last month of the
heating season, which starts in November. Colder weather in the
large cities in the Northeast and Midwest can boost energy
demand as people seek to heat homes and businesses.  The hemisphere’s astronomical spring starts at 7:02 a.m.
New York time on March 20.  The impact of cooler March weather is less than it would be
in January because temperatures are significantly higher.
January is usually the coldest time of the year.  The normal average temperature in  New York City  on March 15
is 42 degrees, while on Jan. 15, it’s 32, according to the
 National Weather Service .  In Chicago it’s 38 on March 15 and 24 on Jan. 15, the
weather service said. March accounts for about 17.8 percent of
seasonal gas-heating demand compared with 25 percent for
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
