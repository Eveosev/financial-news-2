New York  Yankees pitcher  Phil Hughes 
could miss the beginning of the season as he recovers from a
bulging disk in his upper back, manager  Joe Girardi  said.  “It’s possible,” Girardi said yesterday on the team’s
website. “It’s too early to tell.”  Hughes must make four spring training starts to work up to
75-80 pitches a game after he is cleared to return to practice,
Girardi said.  The 26-year-old right-hander has been working out with
aquatic exercises and an underwater treadmill at the team’s
minor-league complex in Tampa, Florida.  “Every day is worse in that I’m not throwing, but it’s a
double-edged sword,” Hughes said. “I don’t want to push this
thing and have it become a recurring issue. I want to make sure
that it’s over and done with. At the same time, every day is a
day lost, so I’m kind of in that in-between zone.”  Hughes went 16-13 with a 4.23 earned run average in 32
starts last season for the Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
