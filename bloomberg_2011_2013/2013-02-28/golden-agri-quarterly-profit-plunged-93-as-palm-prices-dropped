Golden Agri-Resources Ltd. (GGR) , the
world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, said fourth-quarter
profit declined 93 percent as prices of the commodity declined.  Net income was $53.6 million in the three months ended Dec.
31, from $747.8 million a year earlier, the Singapore-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue in the quarter gained
14 percent to $1.519 billion.  Golden Agri follows rival producers  Sime Darby Bhd. (SIME)  and
 Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd. (FGV)  in reporting lower profits
after palm oil prices fell 23 percent last year as inventories
piled up and demand weakened. Palm oil, used in food and fuels,
will probably drop further this year after Asian producers
boosted acreage and global oilseeds supplies rose, according to
Dorab Mistry, a director at Godrej International Ltd.  The company “is of the view that palm oil industry remains
resilient with its robust fundamentals as demand for palm oil
will continue to grow,” Chief Executive Officer Franky Widjaja
said today in a statement. “Our focus for this year is to carry
on with our expansion, organically and by way of acquisition.”  Shares gained 2.4 percent to close at 65 cents in Singapore
today. The announcement was made after trading hours. The stock
is unchanged this year, under-performing the 4 percent gain in
the benchmark  Straits Times  index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
