Apple Inc. (AAPL) , attempting to block a
group lawsuit alleging it collected data from millions of
customers’ mobile devices while they used applications approved
by the company, said plaintiffs failed to prove their claims.  Lawyers for the customers asked U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh at a hearing yesterday in San Jose, California, to designate
the suit a class action. Apple argues the request should be
denied because plaintiffs haven’t shown that any users had
personal information collected by the free apps without their
consent, and as a result, can’t show they suffered any harm,
according to a court filing.  The customers’ attorneys have abandoned their damages
claims because they can’t prove any injury, and are proceeding
with the class-action request “in a desperate attempt” to
recover fees, Apple argued in the filing.  The customers alleged in the complaint that Cupertino,
California-based Apple collected data on their geographical
locations through applications on mobile devices including
iPhones and iPads even after they said they didn’t want to share
the information.  The case is In re Apple Inc. iPhone/iPad Application
Consumer Privacy Litigation, 11-md-02250, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  (San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
