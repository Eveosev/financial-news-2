Colombian yields fell for the first
time in four days as central bank co-director Carlos Gustavo Cano signaled policy makers will cut  interest rates  further.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 decreased three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.01 percent at 10:35 a.m.
in Bogota, according to the central bank. They have dropped 23
basis points in February. The yields declined to 4.97 percent on
Feb. 22, the lowest since the securities were issued in 2009.  Policy makers have reduced the target lending rate by 1.5
percentage points since June to 3.75 percent as growth waned and
consumer prices rose at the slowest pace in almost three years.
The central bank needs to remain expansive “for a very long
time,” Cano said in interview on Javeriana Radio today.  “Cano is known to be the most dovish of the board so it’s no
surprise he’s hinting at a cut,” John Jairo Ramirez, a fixed-
income analyst at brokerage Bolsa y Renta SA, said in a phone
interview from Medellin. Peso bond yields are also dropping on
bets inflation slowed, which boosts the return of fixed-rate
securities, he said.  Annual inflation was 1.91 percent in February compared with
2 percent in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the
national statistics agency’s report March 5. That is below the
lower end of the central bank’s target rage of 3 percent plus or
minus one percentage point.  The peso was little changed at 1,814.70 per  U.S. dollar 
today and has declined 2.2 percent in February as the government
and central bank announced increased dollar purchases to stem a
rally that sent the local currency to a 17-month intraday high
on Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
