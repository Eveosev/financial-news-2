Mexico  expects installations of
photovoltaic panels to surge 150-fold by 2020, driven by the
country’s “abundant” solar resource, according to the Ministry
of Energy.  Installed capacity will increase to 1,500 megawatts by the
end of the decade from 10 megawatts connected to the grid now,
Claudia Hernandez, the ministry’s director or renewables, said
at a conference in Mexico City today. That will require about
31.4 billion pesos ($2.46 billion) in investment.  Wind capacity
will increase 10-fold to about 12,000 megawatts over the same
period, she said.  The growth will help Mexico meet a goal of getting 35
percent of its power from renewable sources by 2026, up from
about 23 percent now including large hydroelectric plants.  The government approved the goal in April 2011 and plans to
set targets for specific generation technologies this year, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
