Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-biggest air carrier by market share, rose as its
frequent-flier unit moved closer to an initial public offering.  Shares gained 3.1 percent to 12.51 reais at 12:23 p.m. in
Sao Paulo, its highest price on a closing basis since Feb. 22.
The stock was the second-biggest advancer on the  Bovespa index ,
which rose 0.4 percent.  The Sao Paulo-based airline said in a regulatory filing
after the market closed yesterday that its mileage unit, known
as Smiles SA, filed a request with regulators to issue shares.
The company didn’t give any more details on the offer.  “The IPO is very positive for both Gol and Smiles,”
Felipe Silveira, an analyst at brokerage Coinvalores in Sao
Paulo, said in a telephone interview today. “For Gol, it
unlocks the value of an asset that was a little forgotten.”  The filing marks another step in an IPO process that
started last year when Gol said Smiles would become an
independent unit, Silveira said.  Gol has dropped 13 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
