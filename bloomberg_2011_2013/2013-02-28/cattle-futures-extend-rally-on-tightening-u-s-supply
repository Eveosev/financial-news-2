Cattle futures rose, extending the
longest rally in three months, on signs that supplies tightened
after winter storms across the central U.S. disrupted animal
shipments and spurred weight losses. Hogs also increased.  Wholesale  beef  rose 0.9 percent yesterday to $1.8557 a
pound, a four-week high, the latest government figures showed.
The second major storm in two weeks covered the southern Great
Plains with more than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of snow. During
cold weather, livestock use more energy to stay warm, leading to
lower weight.  “There’s still talk, especially in the southern Plains
area, of problems with these snowstorms,” Dick Quiter, an
account executive at McFarland Commodities LLC in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview. “There are just not as many cattle
available. Also, they’re probably losing weight.”  Cattle futures for April delivery increased 0.2 percent to
$1.301 a pound at 10:23 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The price rose for the fifth straight session, the longest rally
since Nov. 23.  Through yesterday, the commodity dropped 2.2 percent in
February, snapping a four-month rally.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement fell 0.1 percent
to $1.47375 a pound.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.2 percent to 81.175
cents a pound. Through yesterday, the price dropped 9.3 percent
this month, heading for the biggest decline since July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
