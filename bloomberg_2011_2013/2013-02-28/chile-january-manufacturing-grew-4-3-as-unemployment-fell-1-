Chile’s  manufacturing index 
increased 4.3 percent in January from the previous year, beating
economists’ estimates as the unemployment rate unexpectedly
declined.  The median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for manufacturing to rise 3 percent from last year. Retail
sales grew 9.5 percent, compared with the median estimate of 9.8
percent. Unemployment fell to 6 percent in the three months
through January after analysts forecast it would remain
unchanged from the December rate of 6.1 percent, the National
Statistics Institute said in a report published today.  Private consumption and investment drove economic growth in
the Andean nation last year, offsetting weaker demand for raw
materials and manufactured exports. Manufacturing grew just 2.4
percent in 2012 compared with an 8.8 percent expansion in retail
sales.  Policy makers have kept  borrowing cost s at 5 percent for 13
straight monthly meetings. The key rate will rise to 5.25
percent by March 2014 after remaining unchanged for at least the
next six months, according to traders and investors surveyed by
the central bank on Feb. 26. Inflation in January accelerated to
1.6 percent from 1.5 percent the month before, which was the
slowest in 2 1/2 years.  Gross domestic product climbed 5.7 percent in the third
quarter from the previous year as investment leaped 13 percent
and private consumption gained 6.4 percent, according to central
bank data. GDP expanded 5.7 percent in the second quarter and
5.2 percent in the first, and grew an estimated 5.45 percent for
all of 2012, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.  Copper output  in the world’s largest producer of the metal
rose 8.6 percent in January from a year earlier to 474,496
metric tons, the institute said. The peso strengthened 0.1
percent to 472.5 per U.S. dollar at 9:04 a.m. local time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
