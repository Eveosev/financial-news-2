Morgan Stanley (MS) , the top equity
underwriter last year, named Dan Simkowitz to co-lead the firmâ€™s
capital markets unit.  Simkowitz, who had been chairman of the unit, will run the
group with current head  Raj Dhanda , according to an internal
memo from investment banking co-chiefs Franck Petitgas and Mark Eichorn. Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for the New York-
based bank, confirmed the contents of the memo.  Morgan Stanley generated $2.56 billion in revenue from debt
and equity underwriting last year, as it ranked first among
equity offerings and initial public offerings. Revenue climbed 3
percent from 2011, the smallest increase among the five largest
Wall Street banks, as equity issuance volume fell and debt
issuance soared to a record.  Simkowitz, 47, has worked on equity underwriting deals
including the IPOs of  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Facebook Inc. His
background differs from Dhanda, who ran the debt syndicate unit
before taking control of the  capital markets  division.  Dhanda was named to run capital markets with John Hyman and
Ted Pick in 2008. Dhanda has led the business on his own for the
past three years after Pick moved over to lead the equities-
trading business and Hyman left the firm.  The New York Times reported the promotion earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
