Nigeria ’s naira depreciated for a
fourth day, capping the biggest monthly decline since June.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer retreated 0.3
percent to 158.55 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, giving a 0.9 percent retreat this month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The naira weakened as foreign capital inflows reduced
lately amid a more risk-averse global environment in February,”
 Samir Gadio , an  emerging-markets  strategist at Standard Bank
Group Ltd., Africa’s largest bank by assets, said in e-mailed
comments.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has slid 1.5
percent in February, the most since May. Nigeria has about $10
billion worth of speculative investments, which may leave the
country at short notice if global investment risks increase,
Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said in December.  The regulator held the benchmark  interest rate  at a record
high 12 percent for an eighth straight time on Jan. 21 to
control inflation and stabilize the naira. The nation’s
inflation rate fell to 9 percent in January from 12 percent in
December, the statistics bureau said Feb. 18.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 rose six basis points to 10.61 percent, according
to yesterday’s data compiled on the  Financial Markets Dealers
Association  website.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 fell 10 basis points to 4.40 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.2 percent to 1.92 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
