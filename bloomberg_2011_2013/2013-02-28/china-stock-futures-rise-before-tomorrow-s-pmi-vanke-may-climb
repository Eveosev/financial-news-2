China’s stocks rose for a second day
as property developers rallied after  China Vanke Co. (000002) ’s profit
beat analyst estimates. A  volatility  gauge jumped before the
release of a manufacturing report tomorrow.  Vanke advanced 4.2 percent after the biggest developer said
net income climbed 30 percent last year. Sany Heavy Industry Co.
led industrial companies to the biggest gain among 10 groups in
the  CSI 300 Index. (SHSZ300)   Zijin Mining Group Co. (601899)  paced losses for gold
shares as bullion prices headed for a fifth month of declines.  “The foundation for the stocks rally, namely the economic
recovery, is still there as people spend more on housing and
cars to improve their lives,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at
Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, which
manages $190 million. “We’ll have some corrections along the
way given the index has had a very decent rally.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 0.6 percent to 2,327.43
at the 11:30 a.m. local-time break, paring this month’s losses
to 2.4 percent, the first monthly drop since November. Still,
the index has gained 19 percent since a bull-market rally
started on Dec. 3. Thirty-day  volatility  was at 19.99 yesterday,
the highest since Jan. 28. The measure  trades  for 9.6 times
projected 12-month earnings, near the lowest since Dec. 24.  The CSI 300 Index gained 0.9 percent to 2,617.34, while the
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 1.9 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  added 0.8 percent in  New York 
yesterday, as U.S. housing data sent the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to the highest level in five years.  Manufacturing Report  The National Bureau of Statistics and China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing are scheduled to release a
manufacturing index for this month tomorrow. The  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index may climb to 50.5 from 50.4 a month earlier,
according to the median estimate of 30 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The number of 50 divides expansion and contraction.
HSBC Holdings Plc’s PMI index is also due tomorrow.  HSBC released a preliminary reading of its PMI index on
Feb. 25 that trailed economists’ estimates. Bank of America
Corp.’s China economist Ting Lu said the manufacturing data was
“heavily distorted” by the Chinese Lunar holiday this month.  A gauge of developers surged for a second day, gaining 2.5
percent. Vanke jumped 4.2 percent to 11.80 yuan after reporting
net income climbed to 12.55 billion yuan ($2 billion) last year.
That compares with the 11.95 billion  yuan  average profit
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Biggest rival
Poly Real Estate Group Co. rose 3 percent to 12.75 yuan.  “We’re going to see earnings grow again after 18 to 24
months of flat earnings, which helps create tailwinds for
Chinese stocks,” Eric Brock, who helps manage $3.8 billion as a
portfolio manager at Clough Capital Partners, said by phone
yesterday from Boston.  NPC Awaits  China will keep property curbs for a long time, Vanke’s
President Yu Liang said yesterday. Chinese stocks have fallen
this month on concern the government will announce more property
restrictions to curb gains in housing prices and after the
central bank took steps to reduce market liquidity.  Sany Heavy, the biggest maker of construction equipment,
advanced for a second day, gaining 2.3 percent to 11.54 yuan.  The rally for  China ’s stocks since the end of last year
hasn’t concluded because the economy will continue to recover
and the government may introduce more projects to support
growth, David Lai, portfolio manager at the Hong Kong unit of
China Asset Management, said in a phone interview on Feb. 25.  China will open its annual National People’s Congress on
March 5 to set this year’s growth target and discuss economic
policies. The congress will also elect new government leaders.  Gold Stocks  Almost half of China’s provinces are setting their growth
sights lower in the wake of the central government’s emphasis on
the quality of expansion over speed, a sign of an increased
focus on tackling rising debt. Fourteen provinces have set lower
targets for gross domestic product expansion this year than in
2012 and the other 17 left their goals unchanged, according to
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Zijin Mining, the biggest gold miner, slid 0.3 percent to
3.66 yuan. Shandong Gold Mining Co. declined 0.6 percent to
34.89 yuan.  Gold headed for a fifth monthly decline in the longest run
of losses since 1997 as investors reduced holdings by more than
100 metric tons on concern that U.S. stimulus may be curtailed
as the economy recovers.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
