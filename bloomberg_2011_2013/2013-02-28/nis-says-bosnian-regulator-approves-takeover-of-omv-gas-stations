Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian oil and gas company, said it’s completing the takeover
of 28 gas stations in Bosnia-Herzegovina from  Austria ’s  OMV AG (OMV) 
tomorrow, after the local regulator approved the purchase.  OMV agreed to sell its fuel retail business in Bosnia to
OAO Gazprom Neft-controlled NIS in November, including a storage
facility in capital Sarajevo, the Novi Sad-based company said in
an e-mailed statement. NIS seeks to expand regionally for
selling fuels made in its refinery in Pancevo near Belgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
