Brazil ’s swap rates fell for a
fourth day as a decrease in the services confidence index damped
speculation that the central bank will raise borrowing costs to
contain inflation.  Swap rates due in January 2015 declined four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.36 percent at 10:16 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.97 per dollar,
extending its rally in February to 1.1 percent, the biggest
among 25 emerging-market currencies.  “The swap rates market is reacting to the drop in
confidence in the service sector,”  Luciano Rostagno , the chief
strategist at Banco WestLB do Brasil, said in an interview.  The central bank will decide next week whether to hold the
target lending  rate  at a record low 7.25 percent for a third
straight meeting to support the economy even as inflation has
exceeded the 4.5 percent midpoint of its target range for more
than two years.  Brazil’s services confidence index fell 2.7 percent in
February from a month earlier to 122.1, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation reported today.  President  Dilma Rousseff  said at an event yesterday in
Brasilia that the government needs to maintain a flexible
currency policy. A photo on the front page of the daily
newspaper  Valor Economico  shows her holding a note saying,
“affirm inflation control as a value in and of itself.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
