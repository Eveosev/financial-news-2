Japanese stock futures fell, with
the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  poised to pare some of the gains
that have taken the gauge to the longest winning streak since
2006, before jobless and consumer prices data in Japan and a
gauge of manufacturing in China are released today.  American Depositary Receipts  of Toyota Motor Corp. slid 0.3
percent. ADRs of  Sony Corp. (6758)  gained 1 percent after the consumer
electronics firm said cash from selling a building in Tokyo will
add 41 billion yen ($443 million) to profit in the fourth
quarter. ADRs of  Tokyo Gas Co. (9531)  gained 3.8 percent as the Nikkei
newspaper reported the company will increase share buybacks.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring this
month closed at 11,480 in Chicago yesterday, down from the

Asia Pacific Index to a four-month advance, its longest winning
streak since September 2009, amid signs the U.S. and Chinese
economies are improving and on bets Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will step up efforts to stimulate Japanese growth.  Relative Value  The Asia-Pacific benchmark regional equities gauge traded
at 14.8 times average estimated earnings compared with 13.7 for

Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent. U.S. stocks erased gains in the final minutes of

$85 billion in automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration,

defense and non-defense spending. President  Barack Obama  has
summoned congressional leaders to the White House today to
discuss the next step.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
