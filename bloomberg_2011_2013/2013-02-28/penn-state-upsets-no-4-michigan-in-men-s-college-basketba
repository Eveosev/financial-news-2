Pennsylvania State University  upset
the fourth-ranked University of Michigan 84-78 for its first Big
Ten conference victory in more than a year.  Jermaine Marshall scored 25 points, D.J. Newbill scored 17
points and Ross Travis had 15 points and 12 rebounds for the
Nittany Lions (9-18 overall, 1-14 Big Ten) at Bryce Jordan
Center in  University Park ,  Pennsylvania , last night.  Tim Hardaway Jr. had 19 points for the Wolverines (23-5,
10-5 Big Ten), followed by Trey Burke with 18 points.  It was Penn State’s first conference win since it beat Iowa
69-64 on Feb. 16, 2012, and its first success against a top-five
opponent since it beat No. 5 North Carolina 82-74 in the second
round of the 2001 National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.  Also in men’s college basketball last night, fifth-ranked
Miami defeated Virginia Tech 76-58. The Hurricanes improved to
23-4 and 14-1 in the Atlantic Coast Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
