Home prices in Dublin rose for the
first time on an annual basis since 2007, when Ireland’s decade-
long housing boom peaked, according to figures released today by
the  Central Statistics Office .  Home prices in the Irish capital increased 2.1 percent in
January from a year earlier and climbed 0.5 percent from
December, the CSO said. Nationally, prices fell 3.3 percent on
an annual basis and dropped 0.6 percent from December.  House prices in Ireland have declined by half since peaking
in 2007, helping to plunge the country into the worst recession
in its modern history. Unemployment has trebled since then to
more than 14 percent. Data yesterday showed Irish payrolls rose
in the last quarter of 2012 for the first time since 2008.  “We would caution against expecting any significant
rebound in the headline property-price register this year,”
said Owen Callan, an economist at Danske Bank A/S in Dublin.
“However, we expect in particular a continuation in the
fragile, though strengthening, recovery in the prime Dublin
market in 2013 as well as further signs of stabilization in
prices nationally.”  House prices in Dublin are now 54 percent lower than their
2007 peak, while apartment prices in the Irish capital are 61
percent down, the CSO said on its website.  Irish retail sales fell 1.7 percent in January from
December and dropped 1.2 percent on an annual basis, according
to data released today by the CSO. Sales at department stores
fell 15.1 percent from December, while sales at bars fell 8.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
