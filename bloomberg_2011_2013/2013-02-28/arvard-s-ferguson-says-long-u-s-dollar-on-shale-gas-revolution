Harvard University professor Niall Ferguson, author of ‘The Ascent of Money,’ said he expects the
dollar to rally after shale gas discoveries in North America.  “I am long U.S. dollar, which is somewhat a contrarian
position,” he said today in Abu Dhabi. “The benefits of the
shale gas type oil revolution are still being underestimated by
most observers and I think there’s a lot more upside to come in
the United States than most people anticipate.”  The U.S. is poised to become a net exporter of liquefied
petroleum gases for the first year ever as shale-based energy
production jumps, prompting new orders for specialized ships to
haul propane and butane. The boom in natural gas and oil
production helped the U.S. meet 84 percent of its energy needs
in the first 10 months of last year, on pace to be the highest
annual level since 1991, EIA data show.  “If you think about what the shale gas type oil story
means for the current account it has to be positive,” Ferguson
said later in an interview. “It has to be reducing it, so
that’s another dollar positive force,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
