Gordon Ramsay  at Claridge’s will
close on June 30 after 12 years at the Mayfair hotel.  “We’d like to thank all our guests for the amazing support
they have given for over a decade but we felt the time was right
to move on to new opportunities and investments,” Gordon Ramsay
Holdings said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company is scheduled to open another London venue,
Union Street Cafe, in Borough, in September. The release said it
is also considering other sites in Mayfair. The decision was
reported earlier in the  Evening Standard .  Thomas Kochs, general manager at  Claridge’s  was quoted in
the newspaper as wishing Ramsay well and saying the time had
come for a “new dining direction” at the hotel.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
