MGA Entertainment Inc. can seek
court permission to proceed with its trade-secret allegations
against  Mattel Inc. (MAT)  after the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San
Francisco threw out MGA’s trial victory on the claims.  U.S. District Judge  David Carter  in Santa Ana, California,
on Feb. 26 allowed MGA’s lawyers to skip a requirement that they
first “meet and confer” with Mattel’s lawyers before they file
a request to allow the claims to proceed as so-called permissive
counterclaims rather than compulsory ones.  The appeals court last month vacated the $172.5 million in
damages and legal costs MGA won in 2011 on its claims that
Mattel employees used fake business cards to gain access to
MGA’s booths at toy fares and obtain confidential information.
The appeals court said those claims shouldn’t have been allowed
to go the jury because they weren’t related to Mattel’s claims
against MGA.  The case is Mattel Inc. v. MGA, 04-09049, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
