Henry Kravis , co-Chairman of  KKR &
Co. (KKR) , said the buyout firm he helped found in 1976 and runs with
 George Roberts  thrives on market disruption.  “We are constantly looking for dislocation,” Kravis said
at the SuperReturn International conference in Berlin today.
“The more dislocation we see in the market the happier we
are.”  Kravis said New York-based KKR sees opportunities in Europe
over a three-to-five-year time horizon, including in Spain, even
as the euro-region sovereign-debt crisis drags on. The firm is
still investing in India, China and southeast Asia “in a major
way,” and is looking at “a number of opportunities in
Australia,” Kravis said, without elaborating.  KKR has “practically closed” an  Asia  fund after “raising
through” the $6 billion cap, Kravis said. “We raised it faster
because people want to be in Asia.”  KKR said earlier this month that the value of its private-
equity portfolio rose 4 percent in the fourth quarter and 24
percent last year. By comparison, the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of large U.S. stocks declined 1 percent in the quarter and
gained 13 percent in 2012. KKR said it returned $9 billion to
investors in 2012, the most in its 36-year history.  To contact the reporters on this story:
