Elster Group SE (ELTTY) , a gas, electricity
and water meter provider, won an order from the Brazilian
utility Sanepar to supply 105,000 single-jet smart water meters
in the next three months. No terms were disclosed.  The order from Curitiba-based Sanepar, or Companhia de
Saneamento do Parana, was announced today by both companies. It
expands the utilityâ€™s selection of Essen, Germany-based Elster
in January 2012 to supply 52,000 meters to improve water
management and more accurately bill customers for usage and to
help identify water leaks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
