Mexico ’s peso fell, extending its
first monthly decline since October, as economists boosted
forecasts for a cut in borrowing costs this year, with some
projecting a rate cut as soon as next month.  The peso depreciated 0.1 percent to 12.7776 per  U.S. dollar 
at 8:58 a.m. in Mexico City, bringing its monthly drop to 0.5
percent. The currency rallied 8.4 percent in 2012.  Nineteen of 20 economists projected the central bank will
cut rates this year, up from eight two weeks earlier, according
to a Citigroup Banamex survey published Feb. 20. Seven of the
economists projected a cut on March 8.  “The number one factor was the expectation that they could
cut rates,”  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Banco Base SA
in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said in a phone interview.  Yields on peso bonds due 2024 were little changed today at
5.12 percent, leaving them down seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, in February. The price fell 0.01 centavo to
143.13 centavos per peso today.  Mexican central bank board member Manuel Sanchez said
yesterday there is no need for the first interest-rate cut since
July 2009. The peso rallied 0.6 percent yesterday after his
comments.  “At this moment in time, I don’t see a case for a rate
cut,” Sanchez said in an interview at Bloomberg’s office in
Mexico City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
