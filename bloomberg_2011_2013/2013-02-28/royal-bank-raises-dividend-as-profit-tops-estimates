Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender by assets, said first-quarter profit rose 12
percent on higher fees from  investment banking  and record
earnings from  consumer lending .  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 was C$2.07 billion
($2.02 billion), or C$1.36 a share, compared with C$1.86
billion, or C$1.22, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender
said today in a statement.  Royal Bank benefited from a 25 percent profit gain from its
RBC Capital Markets investment-banking business, and posted
record earnings in consumer and business banking and wealth
management. The bank raised its quarterly  dividend  5 percent to
63 cents a share, its first increase since August.  Profit excluding some items was C$1.38 a share, beating the
C$1.32 a share average  estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News .  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss
