China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, said profit probably fell about 40
percent last year on lower investment yields and increased
impairment losses because of weakness in  capital markets . Shares
dropped.  Net income was 18.3 billion  yuan  ($2.9 billion) for 2011,
the Beijing-based company said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange yesterday. The insurer in October reported its
first quarterly loss since 2008, at 2.2 billion yuan. Profit for
the first nine months of 2012 was 7.4 billion yuan, down 56
percent from the same period a year earlier.  “That’s in line with market expectations as they already
reported a big profit decline for the first three quarters,”
said Olive Xia, a Shanghai-based analyst at Core Pacific-
Yamaichi International Ltd. “The mark-to-market gains in equity
holdings in the fourth quarter can’t yet be booked as income due
to accounting rules, but the first quarter this year should look
better as they’ll have opportunities to reduce positions” and
lock in profit, she said.  The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 5.2 percent in
the first nine months of 2012, eroding the value of insurers’
stock holdings, as  China ’s economic expansion slowed. China Life
booked 29 billion yuan in impairment losses for that period, an
almost fivefold gain from a year earlier. The equity gauge
rebounded 8.8 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.3 percent so
far this year amid signs of an acceleration in economic growth.  China Life declined 1.7 percent to HK$22.90 as of 9:36 a.m.
in Hong Kong trading, while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  fell
0.2 percent. The shares are down 8.7 percent this year, while
the Hang Seng Index is up 1.4 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
