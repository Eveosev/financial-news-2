Qatar Petroleum  is about to hire
consultants for the financing of a $6.5 billion petrochemical
plant to be built in partnership with  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , the
state energy company’s director of finance said.  Banks and export credit agencies will be an important
source of credit for the Al Karaana complex, Abdulrahman Ahmad
Al-Shaibi said today at a press conference in Doha, the Qatari
capital. “We are also looking into other sources of financing
such as the  capital markets  and Islamic banking,” he said.  Financing will be sought once the engineering and
construction contract is signed, he said, without specifying a
date or identifying the consultants to be hired. Qatar Petroleum
and Shell awarded the engineering and design contract for the
plant to  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  of Irving, Texas.  Qatar, the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural
gas, seeks to diversify its economy away from petroleum exports
by building industrial plants that make petrochemicals, aluminum
and steel. Al Karaana, 80 percent owned by Qatar Petroleum and
20 percent by Shell, will be built in the industrial city of Ras
Laffan and completed by 2018, Qatar’s Energy Minister Mohammed
Bin Saleh Al Sada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
