Vitol Group, the world’s largest
independent oil trader, hired vessels for 5,495 voyages in 2012
and said it expects shipping to continue to be “severely
challenged,” especially for tankers that carry crude oil.  “Long-haul crude movement is expected to fall but the
supply of vessels will still increase,” the Geneva-based
company said in its annual report e-mailed today.  “The outlook is a little brighter” for tankers that carry
refined oil products, according to the report. “We expect to
see greater products exports out of both the Middle East and the
U.S. Gulf Coast which may contain the impact of the increase in
supply somewhat.”  The global fleet of product tankers ranks highest amongst
investor interest, as rates paid to charter the vessels
outperform those carrying crude oil, RS Platou Markets AS, an
Oslo-based investment bank, said in a Feb. 13 report. Platou
estimates rates for product tankers will rise to $14,000 daily
this year, from $13,000 in 2012, as earnings for the biggest
crude carriers decline to $20,000 daily, from $21,000.  Vitol’s delivered crude-oil trading volumes totaled 117
million metric tons, it said. Total traded volumes of crude and
products declined to 261 million tons from 273 million in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
