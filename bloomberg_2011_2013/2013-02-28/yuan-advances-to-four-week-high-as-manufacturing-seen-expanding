China’s  yuan  advanced to a four-week
high as the central bank set the currency’s fixing at the
strongest level in more than a month before a report that is
forecast to show manufacturing growth accelerated.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  0.1
percent to 6.2779 per dollar, the strongest level since Jan. 23
and the biggest increase since Feb. 8. That followed the Dollar
Index’s two-day decline of 0.43 percent as Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke defended the central bank’s bond-
buying. An official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index
will climb to 50.5 for February from 50.4 in January, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due
tomorrow.  “There are signs that  China ’s growth momentum is picking
up and the central bank is willing to let the yuan appreciate a
bit with a stronger fixing,” said Bruce Yam, a Hong Kong-based
foreign-exchange strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd.  The yuan climbed 0.1 percent to close at 6.2213 per dollar
in  Shanghai , prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System
show. It touched 6.2208 earlier, the strongest since Jan. 31.
The currency’s five-day gain of 0.31 percent pared its monthly
loss to 0.04 percent. The spot rate is allowed to trade as much
as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  The Chinese currency overtook the Russian ruble for
transactions in the global payment system for the first time in
January, according to a report by the Society for Worldwide
Interbank Financial Telecommunication released yesterday.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan advanced 0.06
percent to 6.2200 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05
percent to 6.3205, a 1.6 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
