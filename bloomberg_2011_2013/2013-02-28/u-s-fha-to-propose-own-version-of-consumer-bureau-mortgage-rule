The  Federal Housing Administration 
will propose its own rule requiring lenders to confirm a
borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage, an agency spokesman said
today.  Premium increases and other fee changes scheduled to go
into effect April 1 could push the cost of FHA loans above the
threshold for the safest loans as defined in a rule issued by
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January.  The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-regulation overhaul allows
FHA to propose its own version of the so-called Qualified
Mortgage rule, which defines abusive lending and offers legal
protections to lenders who issue loans without high fees and
other risky features.  “We’re undertaking that process and will publish a
proposed rule for comment in the near future,”  Brian Sullivan ,
an FHA spokesman, said in a statement. The agency’s action was
reported earlier by National Mortgage News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
