U.S. mortgage rates for 30-year
fixed loans fell for the first time in six weeks, decreasing
borrowing costs as home-price gains accelerated.  The average 30-year rate was 3.51 percent in the week ended
today, down from 3.56 percent, McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie
Mac (FMCC)  said in a statement. The average 15-year rate slipped to
2.76 percent from 2.77 percent.  Borrowing costs at near-record lows,  improving  employment
and a tight  supply  of properties on the market are fueling a
housing rebound after the worst slump since the 1930s. The
S&P/Case-Shiller  index  of home prices in 20 U.S. cities climbed
in the 12 months through December by the most since July 2006,
the group said this week.  “It’s the rising prices that is the game changer,”
 Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS Global Insight in
Lexington,  Massachusetts , said in a telephone interview
yesterday. “Housing is going to be the key driver that will get
economy on a higher growth path.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told the House
Financial Services Committee yesterday that the housing market
has “hit bottom” and is on the road to recovery.  Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes increased
4.5 percent to the highest level since April 2010, according to
data from the National Association of Realtors released
yesterday.  Purchases of  new homes , logged when contracts are signed,
jumped in January to a 437,000 annual rate, the fastest pace
since July 2008, the Commerce Department said Feb. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
