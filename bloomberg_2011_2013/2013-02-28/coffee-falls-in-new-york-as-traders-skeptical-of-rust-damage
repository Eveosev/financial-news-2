Coffee fell for a second day in  New
York  on speculation that even leaf rust endangering Latin
American crops won’t be enough to dent a glut of stockpiles.  Beans in warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S. are the
highest since March 2010. The leaf rust fungus known as roya may
cut Guatemala’s crop by 50 percent in the harvest that starts
Oct. 1, Christian Wolthers, president of importer Wolthers
America in  Fort Lauderdale ,  Florida , said Feb. 26.  “The roya issues have not been enough yet to put a serious
bid underneath the market as the trader will likely continue to
be skeptical about the matter for the time being,” Sterling
Smith, futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in
an e-mailed report dated yesterday.  Arabica coffee for May delivery dropped 0.9 percent to
$1.421 a pound at 9:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Raw sugar for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to 18.04 cents
a pound. The March contract, which expires today, dropped 0.3
percent. The delivery from the contract that will published
tomorrow will probably be small, Nick Penney, senior trader at
Sucden Financial Ltd. in  London , said in an e-mail today.  Cocoa declined 0.1 percent to $2,128 a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
