Bank of Nova Scotia  issued $150
million of securities tied to the debt of  France , the Canadian
bankâ€™s first structured notes sold outside the U.S. in 11 years.  The five-year credit-linked securities, issued on Feb. 25,
pay 88.5 basis points more than the London interbank offered
rate for three-month dollar loans, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Toronto-based lender last sold a note outside the U.S.
market in May 2002 when it issued $500 million of callable
floating-rate notes that pay step-up coupons.  In the U.S., the bank sold $57.1 million of notes so far
this year, up from none a year earlier, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The lender issued $226.9 million of the
securities in the U.S. for all of 2012.  Joe Konecny, a spokesman for Scotiabank, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
