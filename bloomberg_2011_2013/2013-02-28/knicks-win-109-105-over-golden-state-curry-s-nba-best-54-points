J.R. Smith’s tiebreaking basket with
69 seconds left led the New York Knicks to a 109-105 win against
the Golden State Warriors, who got a National Basketball
Association season-high 54 points from Stephen Curry.  Curry was 18-of-28 from the field and hit 11 3-pointers,
one short of matching the NBA record. Curry, whose previous
career best was 42 points, topped the 52 points by Oklahoma
City’s Kevin Durant that had led the NBA this season.  The Knicks (34-20) lead the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division, two games ahead of the Brooklyn Nets (34-24).
The Warriors fell to 33-25 with their second loss in as many
nights.  Carmelo Anthony, who hit the final basket for the Knicks,
led the team with 35 points, Smith came off the bench to score
26 points and Tyson Chandler had 16 points and a career-high 28
rebounds last night at Madison Square Garden in New York.  Carl Landry added 15 points and Jarrett Jack had 14 for the
Warriors.  Golden State was without All-Star forward David Lee, who
was serving a one-game suspension following a shoving match two
nights ago with Indiana’s Roy Hibbert. Curry and Klay Thompson,
and the Pacers’ Lance Stephenson, were fined $35,000 each for
escalating the altercation, NBA Executive Vice President Stu Jackson said yesterday in an e-mailed release.  The Knicks announced yesterday that reserve forward Rasheed Wallace, 38, who hasn’t played since Dec. 13, probably will be
out another eight weeks after tests showed he’ll need surgery on
a broken bone in his left foot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
