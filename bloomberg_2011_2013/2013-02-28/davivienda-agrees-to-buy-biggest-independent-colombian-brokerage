Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND) ,  Colombia ’s
third-biggest bank, agreed to buy Corredores Asociados SA, the
Andean nation’s biggest independent brokerage, gaining a bigger
fund management stake and an investment banking business.  Davivienda will pay 120 billion pesos ($66 million) for the
company, plus an additional amount that will depend on the
brokerage’s profit, Davivienda Chief Executive Officer Efrain Forero told reporters in Bogota.  Mauricio Botero, one of Corredores Asociados’ founders and
shareholders, said there is a “consolidation trend” among
Colombian brokerages and that he sold his stake to prevent the
company from shrinking or vanishing.  “We sold 100 percent because the market is showing us that
there’s no space for small players,” Botero told reporters in
Bogota. “Brokerages that don’t form alliances will tend to
disappear.”  Davivienda won’t merge Corredores Asociados with its own
brokerage for at least a year, Forero said. The deal, which also
includes Corredores Asociados’ Panama unit, is subject to
approval by regulators, he said.  Forero said Davivienda has enough cash to pay for the
acquisition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
