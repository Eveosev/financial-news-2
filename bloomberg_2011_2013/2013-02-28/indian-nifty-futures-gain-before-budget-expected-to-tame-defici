Indian stocks traded in  New York 
dropped the most in a week, following  shares  in Mumbai lower,
amid concern the nation’s budget lacks measures to curb
expenditure key to containing the fiscal gap.  The Bank of New York Mellon  India  ADR Index tumbled 1.7
percent to 1,111.51 in New York for a 2.8 percent monthly
decline, its biggest since October. The S&P BSE  Sensex (SENSEX)  retreated
1.5 percent to 18,861.54 at the close and ended the month with a
drop of 5.2 percent, its first monthly loss since October.
American depositary receipts of  ICICI Bank Ltd. (IBN)  declined 1.6
percent and ADRs of Infosys Ltd. slipped 1.1 percent.  India targets a  shortfall  of 4.8 percent of gross domestic
product in the year starting April 1, and posted a 5.2 percent
gap in 2012-2013, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said
in parliament. He allocated 330 billion rupees ($6.1 billion)
for the rural jobs program and 100 billion rupees for a plan to
give the poor food grains, before elections next year. That’s
raised concern the 4.8 percent fiscal-gap goal may not be met.  “The main issue, that of curbing expenditure, hasn’t been
tackled,”  Jeff Chowdhry , head of emerging-market equities at
U.K.-based F&C Asset Management Plc., which oversees about $150
billion, told Bloomberg TV India yesterday. “Expectations which
have been heightened in the last few months, particularly in
terms of tackling the  budget deficit , haven’t been followed
through. There’s not much in it for the market or the economy.”  Total expenditure will climb to 16.7 trillion rupees in
2013-2014 from an estimated 14.3 trillion rupees this financial
year, Chidambaram said. The budget set gross market borrowing at
a record 6.29 trillion rupees for 2013-2014, an increase of
almost 13 percent. Net borrowing will be 4.84 trillion rupees.  GDP Data  While the transaction tax on equity futures was pared to
0.01 percent from 0.17 percent, Chidambaram imposed a one-year
10 percent tax surcharge on personal incomes above 10 million
rupees and raised the levy on some companies to 10 percent.  GDP expanded 4.5 percent in the December quarter, trailing
the median estimate of 4.9 percent, official data showed after
markets closed. That’s the  slowest  pace since the three-month
period through March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “To meet the fiscal deficit number, revenue needs to grow
at 20 percent, a challenge given the moderate growth rate, and
would need continued expenditure control,” Rajat Jain, chief
investment officer at Principal PNB Asset Management Co. in
Mumbai, said by e-mail. “There are no major initiatives, which
is not surprising given that it is a pre-election budget. It is
going to be more about execution.”  Bad Loans  ICICI, India’s second-largest lender by assets,  fell  to
$41.92 in New York, with trading volumes 2.4 times the daily
average over the past three months. The share lost 4 percent to
1,040.4 rupees, or $19.10, in Mumbai, its lowest level since
Nov. 27. One ADR represents two ordinary shares.  Infosys slumped 1.1 percent to $53.93. Shares traded in
India fell 0.1 percent to 2,907 rupees, or $53.48.  State Bank of India  sank 6 percent to 2,080.9 rupees, the
most in a year. The  S&P BSE Bankex (BANKEX)  of 14 lenders slumped 3.6
percent, the sharpest drop in a year, amid concern the budget’s
continued focus on growth in farm credit may keep bad loans
elevated, Ananda Bhoumik, senior director at a local unit of
 Fitch Ratings , said by e-mail.  The budget set an agriculture credit target of 7 trillion
rupees even as the nation expects to exceed the 5.75-trillion
rupees target this year ending March.  ‘Resilient Flows’  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  retreated 3.9 percent to 1,354.35
rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s top maker of sport-
utility vehicles and tractors, lost 2.1 percent to 873.7 rupees.
 Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer of the alloy, fell 4.4
percent to 341.5 rupees.  The government has stepped up efforts to revive growth and
cool inflation of almost 7 percent under policy changes since
September. The measures have prompted foreigners to purchase a
net $8.48 billion of local shares this year, a record for the
period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Overseas funds bought
$24.5 billion worth of stocks last year, the highest among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding  China .  “Inflows have historically been reasonably resilient to
slowdown in markets or GDP growth,” Shankar Sharma, joint
managing director at First Global Stockbroking Ltd., said in an
interview to Bloomberg TV India. “I don’t think the flows will
go into negative territory or slowdown significantly. India is a
large market and overseas investors need an allocation.”  The Sensex index trades at 13.3 times  projected 12-month
profits , compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.2
times, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index of
the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. slumped 1.8 percent to
5,693.05. Its March futures settled at 5,729.4.  Rollovers in Nifty futures to the March series were 54.5
percent at 6:01 p.m. yesterday, compared with 64.4 percent for
January series, the data show. Derivative contracts in India
expire on the last Thursday of the month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
