Centrica Plc, planning to double
profitability in  North America  over five years, will look to
expand in U.S. states including  Arizona  and Ohio.  “There’s lots of growth in the northeast and Texas, which
will remain core markets for us,” Badar Khan, 42, who will head
the North American division from April 1, said today in a phone
interview. “We’re constantly looking at the states where
opportunities exist for us” such as Arizona and Ohio.  The company plans to grow in North America through building
current customer bases and with acquisitions, the Windsor, U.K.-
based company said yesterday in a strategy presentation.  Centrica has more than 5 million residential and business
customers across the U.S. and Canada, according to its  website .  North American adjusted operating profit rose 6 percent to
331 million pounds ($503 million) in 2012, it said yesterday.
 Centrica (CNA)  plans to boost global oil and gas output 70 percent to
75 million barrels of oil equivalent this year from 2009.  Part of the growth may come from buying unconventional U.S.
assets such as shale gas and tight oil, Khan said, without
identifying targets. He has been with Centrica since 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
