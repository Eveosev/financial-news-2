time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials climbed
0.2 percent to 1,553.563.  CRUDE OIL  West Texas Intermediate crude was poised for its first
monthly decline since October. U.S. crude stockpiles rose less
than forecast, and fuel demand increased in the world’s biggest
oil consumer.  WTI for April delivery was down 16 cents at $92.60 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of

is down 4.8 percent this month, the first time since 2006 it
fell in February.  Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange slid 5 cents to $111.82 a barrel. The
contract fell 84 cents yesterday. Volumes were about three times
the 100-day average. The European benchmark grade was at a
premium of $19.26 to WTI futures, compared with $19.11
yesterday.  OIL PRODUCTS  The East-West gasoil swap widened, with Asian prices higher

than-expected U.S. economic data boosted the demand outlook from
the second-largest user.  Zinc for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.9
percent to $2,097.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange,
before trading at $2,095 at 2:36 p.m. in  Shanghai . The metal has
lost 2.3 percent this month, the least among the six primary
base metals traded on the bourse. Copper rose 0.7 percent to
$7,923.50 a ton, while the LME Index declined 4.1 percent this
month through yesterday, the most since October.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded on concern that automatic U.S. spending cuts
that are due to take effect from tomorrow may hurt the recovery
of the largest economy, trimming the precious metal’s longest
run of monthly losses since 1997.  Spot gold rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1,603.11 an
ounce, and traded at $1,601.72 at 3:24 p.m. in Singapore. The
metal is still down 3.7 percent in February, poised for a fifth
monthly decline, after investors cut exchange-traded products
holdings by more than 100 metric tons on concern that a 12-year
bull run is coming to an end.  Cash silver gained 0.4 percent to $29.12 an ounce, paring a
monthly decline, and spot platinum climbed 0.2 percent to $1,602
an ounce, also cutting a loss in February. Palladium added 0.6
percent to $747.45 an ounce, heading for a fourth monthly
advance in the best run since January 2011.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat pared gains to head for a monthly loss as investors
weighed whether a widening cash discount to corn will spur
demand before a report that may show weekly U.S. export sales
declined.  Wheat for May delivery was little changed at $7.13 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:45 p.m. in Singapore after
climbing as much as 0.6 percent. Futures are down 8.5 percent
this month, dropping to $6.9775 on Feb. 26, the lowest level
since June 25.  Corn for May delivery was little changed at $6.95 a bushel,
poised to drop 6.1 percent this month. Soybeans for May delivery
fell 0.2 percent to $14.37 a bushel, set to decline 2.2 percent
in February.  Rubber rebounded from the lowest level since December,
paring the first monthly loss in four, after a group
representing the three largest exporters said it may extend
shipment restrictions to support prices.  The contract for delivery in August advanced 1.7 percent to
295.3 yen a kilogram ($3,191 a metric ton) before ending at 293
yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures lost 7.2 percent
this month, the worst performance since June.  Palm oil  fell for a seventh day, the worst run in more than
two months, on speculation that  India , the world’s biggest
buyer, may increase  import taxes  in its annual budget today.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 1.4
percent to 2,377 ringgit ($769) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since Jan. 18, and ended the morning session at 2,387
ringgit. The losing streak is the worst since Dec. 5, taking
declines to 6.7 percent this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
