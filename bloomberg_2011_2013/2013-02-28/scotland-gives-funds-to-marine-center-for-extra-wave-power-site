Scotland ’s government and Highlands
and Islands Enterprise are providing 3 million pounds ($4.6
million) to the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney to
install an extra test site for wave-power generation.  Scotland will also provide 1.1 million pounds for a project
to study capabilities of offshore support ships for maintaining
wave and tidal machinery, Minister for Energy, Enterprise and
Tourism Fergus Ewing said today at a conference in  London .  The government says as much as a quarter of Europe’s tidal
resources and a 10th of its wave resources are in Scottish
waters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
