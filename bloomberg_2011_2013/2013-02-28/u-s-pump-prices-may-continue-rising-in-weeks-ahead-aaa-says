Gasoline  pump prices  in the U.S.
have jumped 49 cents since December, a record increase for the
period, and may rise further,  AAA  the biggest U.S. motoring
organization, said today.  AAA said refinery seasonal maintenance will continue to
pressure gasoline prices. The largest U.S. motoring club expects
prices to peak at a lower level this year although they may peak
earlier in 2013.  “ Gas prices  increased at a dramatically faster pace than
expected in February,” Avery Ash, an AAA spokesman in
 Washington , said in a statement. “There is a lot of uncertainty
on where gas prices will go over the next few weeks, but
hopefully the worst of the price spikes are behind us for now.”  The national average for regular gasoline at the pump today
is $3.782, the highest-ever level for this time of year.
February’s average of $3.65 was a record and 10 cents above the
previous record set in February 2013.  Prices are 6.6 cents above a year ago. The 2012 high was
$3.936 a gallon on April 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
