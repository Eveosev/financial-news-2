Faro Technologies Inc. (FARO) , a maker of
three-dimensional scanners used in everything from car design to
forensic investigations, surged after sales topped estimates,
aided by a large order for surveying tools.  The  shares  rose 18 percent to $42.35 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest gain in two years, and have  advanced  19
percent this year, compared with a 6.9 percent climb for the
Standard & Poor’s SmallCap 600 Index.  Fourth-quarter sales climbed 4.7 percent to $80.7 million
from a year earlier, the Lake Mary, Florida-based company said
in a statement yesterday. Analysts on average had projected
revenue of $68 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Faro sold more of its Focus 3D scanner than expected after
distributor  Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB)  filled up on inventory, said
Richard Eastman, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co.  “Faro had better sales than we thought, better orders and
better earnings,” Eastman said in an interview today. He has a
neutral rating on the stock and a $39 target price.  Net income declined to $7.84 million, or 46 cents a share,
from $9.47 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. That exceeded
analysts’ average estimate of $5.26 million, or 31 cents a
share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
