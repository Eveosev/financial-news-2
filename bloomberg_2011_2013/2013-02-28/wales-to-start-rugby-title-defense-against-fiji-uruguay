Defending champion  Wales  was drawn
in the same pool as two-time winner Fiji at this year’s Rugby
World Cup Sevens, the last global championship before the sport
makes its Olympic Games debut.  Wales, which won the title four years ago in Dubai, had
been among the second band of seeds for the June 28-30
tournament in Moscow. The 24 teams were ranked according to
their results in the International Rugby Board’s Sevens World
Series over the past three seasons.  It’s the first edition of the four-yearly championship
since sevens, a fast-paced game with eight fewer players per
team than rugby union’s traditional format, was added to the
Olympics program for the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.  Fiji, which is trying to win a third world championship in
six editions, and Wales will play opening-round matches against
Tonga and Uruguay.  New Zealand , the 2001 champion, will play the U.S.,  Canada 
and  Georgia  in the opening round, while England, which won the
tournament in 1993, was grouped with  Argentina ,  Portugal  and
Hong Kong.  To contact the reporter on this story:
