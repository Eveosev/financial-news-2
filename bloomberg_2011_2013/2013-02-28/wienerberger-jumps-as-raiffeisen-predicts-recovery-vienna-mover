Wienerberger AG (WIE) , the world’s biggest
brickmaker, rose the most in 18 months after Raiffeisen
Centrobank AG said 2013 could mark the start for an earnings
turnaround and recommended that investors buy the stock.  Wienerberger  jumped  as much as 9.7 percent to 8.75 euros,
the biggest intraday gain since August 2011, and traded 8.1
percent higher at 15:12 p.m. in Vienna. The stock has advanced
25 percent this year, making it the second-best performer in
 Austria ’s benchmark  ATX Prime index . Trading volume was almost
three times the three-month daily average.  “Despite the still cautious message on the demand momentum
in several main markets, it seems that hopes for a bottoming out
are increasingly warranted,” Markus Remis, a Raiffeisen analyst
based in the Austrian capital, wrote in a note to clients. “The
envisaged cost savings should stabilize earnings.” He raised
his price estimate to 10 euros from 6.80 euros and changed his
rating on the stock to buy from hold.  Wienerberger reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 93.7
million euros ($123 million) this week after European
residential construction, on which its main business depends,
shrank 3.5 percent last year. The company plans to cut costs by
50 million euros by the end of 2014, which caused one-time
charges of 43 million euros last year. It forecasts earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 280
million euros this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
