South African officials are
investigating the death of a man who was tied to the back of a
police van and dragged away while onlookers filmed the incident.  Footage on Johannesburg-based TV news channel eNCA showed
the man lashed by his wrists as he was dragged through a crowd.
Two men in police uniforms walk behind the car, one of them at
times carrying his feet, before dropping him as the van sped out
of view. The man, a Mozambican, later died in a police cell from
head injuries, Amnesty International said in a report today.  The Independent Police Investigative Directorate is
investigating the matter, which police chief Riah Phiyega
“strongly condemned,” according to a  statement . The “alleged
brutal treatment” of taxi driver, Mido Macia, took place in
Daveyton, on the eastern outskirts of Johannesburg, it said.
President Jacob Zuma said in an e-mailed statement that he
condemned the action and said he had directed the police
minister to investigate.  “This appalling incident involving excessive force is the
latest in an increasingly disturbing pattern of brutal police
conduct in South Africa,” Noel Kututwa, Amnesty’s southern
Africa director, said in a statement.  Police officers shot dead 34 men when they opened fire on a
mass of striking mineworkers, most of whom were armed with
machetes or wooden sticks, at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana mine near
the mining hub of Rustenburg in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
