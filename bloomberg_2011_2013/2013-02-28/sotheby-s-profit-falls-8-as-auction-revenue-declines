Sotheby’s (BID) , the publicly traded
auctioneer of fine art and collectibles, said fourth-quarter
profit fell 7.6 percent as auction revenue declined and it
refinanced debt.  The New York-based company’s net income fell to $66.1
million from $71.5 million a year earlier. It earned 96 cents a
share, less than the average $1.10 estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Quarterly revenue rose 2.4 percent, to
$291.1 million.  William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby’s chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a conference call that the profit drop was
“skewed in a very significant part by the unprecedented level
of single-owner sale events we had in 2011 which we were not so
lucky to have in 2012.”  Sotheby’s shares rose 18 cents today to $38.23 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. They’re down 4 percent for the
past 12 months, as Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 10 percent.  The auction house said it incurred a loss of $8.3 million,
or 12 cents a share, from refinancing debt that will save it $5
million per year beginning in 2014. It said the comparison with
the year-ago quarter was hurt by a $13.6 million tax benefit
recognized in 2011.  Sotheby’s said it will increase its buyer’s commission for
the first time in almost five years. Rival Christie’s announced
a similar step earlier this month.  Buyer Charge  Starting on March 15, Sotheby’s will charge buyers 25
percent on the first $100,000 of the hammer price; 20 percent on
the portion of the hammer price above $100,000 up to and
including $2 million; and 12 percent on any amount above $2
million.  Previously, buyers paid 25 percent commission on the first
$50,000, 20 percent between $50,000 and $1 million and 12
percent on any amount in excess of $1 million.  The new fees may go some way to addressing declining
auction revenues. In 2012 auction commission revenues fell 11
percent to $622 million while private sales grew 10 percent to
$75 million.  The results and commission increase were released today
after the close of regular trading.  Muse highlights include Greg Evans and Craig Seligman on
