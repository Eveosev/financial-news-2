Carmignac Gestion, a Paris-based
asset manager, hired Vincent Aguado and Pierre-Edouard Bonenfant
as traders, the company said today.  Aguado previously worked in fixed-income sales at  JPMorgan
Chase & Co (JPM)  and traded government, supranational, agency and
covered bonds at Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank
prior to that, Carmignac said.  Bonenfant was a derivatives structurer at Theam, a unit of
BNP Paribas SA.  Aguado and Bonenfant report to Nicolas Courbon, the head of
trading at Carmignac, which oversees the equivalent of about $66
billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
