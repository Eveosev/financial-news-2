SJM Holdings Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest
casino company by revenue, reported a 27 percent increase in
full-year profit as mainland Chinese gamblers bet more.  Net income rose to HK$6.75 billion ($870 million) from
HK$5.3 billion a year earlier, according to a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday.  The company, founded by mogul  Stanley Ho , owns  20 of the 35
casinos  in Macau, including its flagship  Grand Lisboa . It faces
intensifying competition as rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928) 
and  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  expand. SJM won a land grant
in October to build its first casino resort in the Cotai area, a
piece of reclaimed land in Macau that is Asia’s equivalent of
the  Las Vegas Strip .  SJM fell 3.8 percent to HK$19.38 in Hong Kong trading
today.  Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, was HK$1.9 billion,
based on Bloomberg’s calculations from adjusted Ebitda of
HK$5.72 billion for the first nine months. That lagged a median
estimate of HK$2.06 billion from six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  “Disappointment came from lower Grand Lisboa margin given
higher junket commissions,”  Karen Tang , a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research note today.  SJM and other Macau casinos pay commissions to operators
called junkets to bring in high rollers from China’s mainland.  The company proposed a special dividend of 30 Hong Kong
cents a share on top of a final dividend of 50 Hong Kong cents a
share, according to the statement.  Gambling Revenue  Macau’s casino revenue climbed 14 percent to a record 304
billion patacas ($38 billion) in 2012. SJM’s gambling revenue
for the year climbed 4.5 percent to HK$78.9 billion.  The former Macau gaming monopoly’s revenue from VIPs, or
high rollers, rose to HK$53.3 billion from HK$52.8 billion a
year ago.  Sands earlier said it plans to invest at least $2.5 billion
to build its fifth resort, to be called the Parisian, in Macau,
the only city in China where casino gambling is legal. The
Parisian will have a replica of the Eiffel Tower and family-
oriented facilities to attract family-oriented gamblers from
China.  Smaller competitors such as  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128)  and  MGM China
Holdings Ltd. (2282)  have also been given approval to develop a casino
in Cotai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
