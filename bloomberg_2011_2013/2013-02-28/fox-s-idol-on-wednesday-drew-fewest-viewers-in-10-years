“ American Idol ,” suffering a rapid
loss of viewers, drew its smallest Wednesday audience in more
than a decade, pulling down the total ratings for  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s
Fox network.  “Idol,” the once dominant singing show now in its 12th
year, drew 13.1 million viewers last night, the least since
August 2002, according to Nielsen data supplied by the networks.
The audience of viewers ages 18 to 49, a group targeted by
advertisers, was the smallest since July 2003.  “Idol” is proving to be a drag on Fox’s ratings this
season, with the network’s audience down more than 22 percent in
total viewers and the targeted demographic, the Nielsen data
show. Together, the four largest networks are down 6.4 percent
in total viewers and 9.4 percent in the age group.  For “Idol” alone, the ratings are down 18 percent in
total viewers on Wednesdays and 15 percent on Thursdays,
according to Nielsen data. Among the younger audience, the show
has slid 16 percent on Wednesdays and 13 percent on Thursdays.  Even so, among broadcast networks, last night’s show drew
the biggest audience and the most viewers ages 18 to 49.  News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Rupert Murdoch , gained 0.1 percent to $28.84 at 3:07
p.m. The New York-based company’s Class A shares had gained 13
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
