Sempra (SRE)  Energy, a U.S. gas
distributor, plans to raise at least $500 million in an initial
public offering of its Mexico business, two people with direct
knowledge of the sale said.  The details of the IPO are still under discussion including
the amount, said the people, who asked not to be named because
the information is private.  Doug Kline, a San Diego-based spokesman for Sempra Energy,
declined to comment on the value of the transaction.  The company’s IPO would mark the first energy company
offering in Latin America’s second-biggest economy, where
lawmakers are expected to consider legal overhauls to break
Petroleos Mexicanos’s monopoly on fuel delivery.  Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and the heads of the
nation’s biggest political parties signed a pact on Dec. 2
calling for the passage of an energy bill that would open up
activities including refining and fuel distribution to private
investment.  Pemex, as the state oil producer is known, said last month
it would partner with Sempra in a joint venture to build the
first phase of a natural-gas pipeline in Northern Mexico. Sempra
also won a contract in October with state power utility Comision
Federal de Electricidad, or CFE, to build a gas pipeline and
operate it for 25 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
