The Egyptian pound and the benchmark
dollar bonds headed for their third monthly declines as
increased political instability hindered the country’s attempt
to secure a $4.8 billion International Monetary Fund loan.  The pound depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 6.7403 a
dollar as of 1:46 p.m. in Cairo after the central bank’s third
foreign-exchange auction this week, taking the monthly drop to
0.4 percent. The currency has weakened 9.3 percent in the past
three months, the worst performer among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The 5.75 percent dollar-
denominated notes yielded 7.18 percent today, up 75 basis
points, or 0.75 percentage point, in February.  Egypt ’s political stalemate deepened this week when the
National Salvation Front, an umbrella of opposition groups, said
it was boycotting parliamentary elections that start in April.
Securing the IMF loan is vital to improving the balance of
payments and preventing an uncontrolled  currency depreciation ,
Fitch Ratings Ltd. said yesterday.  Banks received less than a quarter of the currency they
sought at today’s auction of $38.3 million of the U.S. currency,
which was sold at a cut-off price of 6.7304, according to the
regulator’s announcement on Bloomberg. A shortage of dollars has
led to the emergence of a black market for the currency, with
illegal traders charging 7.4 a dollar, according to data
published by state-run news website Ahram Gate yesterday.  The Arab country also sold 2.5 billion pounds ($371
million) of six-month treasury bills and 4 billion pounds of 12-
month securities today, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. The yield on one-year T-bills gained to 13.97 percent
from 13.96 percent at last week’s auction, the data show. The
six-month yield was little changed at 13.34 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
