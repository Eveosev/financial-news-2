Terex Corp. (TEX) , the maker of cranes and
lifts, expects to cut about 1.8 percent of its workers this year
as it restructures construction and port-equipment units.  The company is restructuring its compact construction
operations in  Germany  and expects to sell or close several
businesses, which will cost $11.7 million and result in the
reduction of 368 workers in 2013, Terex said in a filing today.
The Westport, Connecticut-based company is also cutting about 26
jobs in its material-handling and ports segment.  “We plan to exit a number of compact construction
component manufacturing businesses in Germany,”  Ron DeFeo ,
Terex’s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
company’s earnings statement on Feb. 19. “Many of these
businesses were generating poor returns and we expect these
actions to improve operating results as the year progresses.”  Terex’s lastest steps follow its 2011 restructuring of
manufacturing operations in North America and Britain and are
part of an effort to focus its businesses and nearly double
earnings to $5 a share on sales of $10 billion by 2015. The
company on Feb. 19 forecast earnings of $2.40 to $2.70 a share
on revenue of $7.9 billion to $8.3 billion this year.  Terex is also restructuring its material handling and port
solutions segment, closing a production site in Spain. The unit,
which includes some cranes and port equipment, had been “under-
performing,” Tom Gelston, a spokesman, said in an interview
today.  The manufacturer employed about 21,300 people worldwide on
Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
