  BroadSoft Inc. (BSFT)  fell the most ever
after the telecommunications-software maker forecast annual
earnings and revenue lower than analysts estimated.  The shares tumbled 32 percent to $21 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest one-day drop since their market debut in
June 2010. The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company has fallen
42 percent this year, while the Russell 2000 Index has advanced
7.3 percent.  BroadSoft, which counts  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  among
its  customers , creates software allowing mobile and cable
service providers to deliver voice and multimedia over their
Internet protocol-based networks. Those clients saw fewer new
additions of their own, which contributed to the low forecast,
said Richard Valera, an analyst with Needham & Co. Verizon added
134,000 FiOS TV accounts in its most recent quarter, compared
with 194,000 a year earlier.  “There aren’t a lot of new customers out there and the
rate of growth is slowing,” Valera said.  No one customer accounted for more than 10 percent of
revenue as of Dec. 31, according to BroadSoft’s annual filing.
Verizon had accounted for about 15 percent of BroadSoft’s sales
at the end of 2010.  The company forecast 2013 earnings per share of $1.10 to
$1.35. Analysts had estimated $1.72, on average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue will be $181 million to $189 million, according to
a statement. Analysts had estimated $197.7 million.  Professional Services  “If you look at where the consensus numbers were versus
where they guided, there’s a substantial gap there,” said
Valera, who maintained a buy rating on the stock.  The forecast prompted at least two  downgrades .  Additionally, BroadSoft’s professional services, which has
benefited from deferred revenue in recent years, will not do so
in 2013, which contributed to the weaker outlook, Valera said.
However, BroadSoft’s cloud-based communications segment is
likely to grow in 2013 and the company should meet or beat
estimates, Valera said.  “We would hope they’ve set the bar at an achievable, if
not beatable, level,” he said.  The company yesterday reported fourth-quarter earnings
excluding some items of 47 cents a share, from 38 cents a year
earlier. Analysts had estimated 41 cents.  Sales increased 13 percent to $45.8 million. That compared
to an average estimate of $45.7 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
