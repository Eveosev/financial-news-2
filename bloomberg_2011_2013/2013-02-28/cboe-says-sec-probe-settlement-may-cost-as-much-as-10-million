CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) ’s cost to settle
a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation may be
as much as $10 million, according to a regulatory filing.  The biggest U.S. options market by volume said a year ago
that regulators were probing whether the company complied with
its obligations as a self-regulatory organization. American
exchanges are required to write rules for their markets, monitor
trading and seek to ensure that they and their customers aren’t
breaking securities laws.  “While an agreement has not been reached with the SEC
staff, we believe that any resolution of this matter would
include a monetary penalty and may require CBOE to make
additional changes to its compliance programs and procedures,”
the company wrote in the filing. CBOE said the likelihood of
charge in excess of $10 million is “remote.”  CBOE said Feb. 8 it set aside $5 million to cover the
resolution.  John Nester , a SEC spokesman declined to comment. Gail Osten, a spokeswoman for CBOE, did not immediately respond to
messages requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
