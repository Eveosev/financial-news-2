Yuan  deposits in Hong Kong climbed
in January to within 0.5 percent of a record as investors
revived bets on the currency’s appreciation as the outlook for
growth in Asia’s largest economy improved.  Savings rose 21 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) from the
previous month to 624 billion yuan, the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority said in a statement on its website today. That’s close
to the record 627.3 billion reached at the end of November 2011.
December’s 32 billion yuan jump in the savings was the biggest
since August 2011.  “We are very positive on the renminbi’s long-term
prospects versus the dollar,” Chen Xiaoping, chief executive
officer at  China Everbright International Ltd. (257) , said at a media
briefing in Hong Kong today. “Our sales income will be in
 renminbi  and we are very comfortable to pay back debt in that
currency.” The yuan is a denomination of the Renminbi, which is
the official name of  China ’s currency.  Hong Kong handled 268 billion yuan of trade settled in the
Chinese currency in January, a 1.7 percent increase from
December, according to HKMA data.  The yuan advanced to a four-week high in  Shanghai , as the
People’s Bank of China set the currency’s fixing at the
strongest level in more than a month. It rose 0.1 percent today
to close at 6.2213 per dollar. An official report tomorrow may
show China’s manufacturing growth accelerated.  The currency will appreciate 2.1 percent to 6.1 per dollar
by the end of 2013, doubling the pace of 1 percent increase last
year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
