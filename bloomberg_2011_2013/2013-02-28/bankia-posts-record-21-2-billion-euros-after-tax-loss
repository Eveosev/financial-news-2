BFA-Bankia (BKIA) , whose collapse last May
helped push Spain into a European banking bailout, posted a
record after-tax loss of 21.2 billion euros ($27.6 billion) as
it cleansed soured assets from its balance sheet.  The  loss  widened from 4.95 billion euros in 2011, Madrid-
based Bankia said in a filing to regulators today. The firm
booked 26.8 billion euros in provisioning charges in 2012 after
its listed Bankia unit posted a net loss of 19 billion euros
compared to a loss of 2.98 billion euros in 2011, it said.  Spain sought as much as 100 billion euros in European
bailout funds last year on concerns that mounting losses at
Bankia, crafted from a merger of seven savings banks, would pile
pressure on government finances. After the group took 18 billion
euros of state aid, Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri is
targeting earnings of 1.2 billion euros in 2015 as he shifts
soured real estate to Spainâ€™s new bad bank, sheds about 6,000
staff and closes 39 percent of its branches.  The after-tax loss would have been 19.4 billion euros
taking into account gains from an exchange of hybrid debt
instruments, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
