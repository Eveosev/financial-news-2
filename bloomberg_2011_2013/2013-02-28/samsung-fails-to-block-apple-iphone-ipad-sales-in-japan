Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  failed in a
bid to block sales of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPads and iPhones in  Japan , the
latest step in a global patent spat between the world’s two
largest smartphone makers.  The Tokyo District Court rejected the request as Samsung
hadn’t negotiated “sincerely” with Apple over licensing data-
sending patents, Judge Ichiro Otaka said in a ruling today. The
court also ruled that Samsung doesn’t have the right to seek
damages from Apple.  Samsung is “disappointed” with the court decision, Nam Ki-yung, a spokesman, said by e-mail. “We will take the
measures necessary to protect our intellectual property
rights.” Takashi Takebayashi, a Tokyo-based spokesman for Apple,
declined to comment when contacted by phone.  The two phone-makers are suing each other in dozens of
 cases  worldwide, trying to use patents to force the other into
changing products or removing some models from sale. At stake is
market share in the mobile-device market that researcher  Yankee
Group  expects to double to $847 billion by 2016.  In August, the Tokyo District Court separately ruled that
Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s smartphones and a tablet
computer didn’t infringe on an Apple invention for synchronizing
music and video data with servers.  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , claimed that the
Galaxy S, Galaxy Tab and Galaxy S II infringed the patent on
synchronization, and sought 100 million yen ($1.1 million) in
damages, according to court documents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
