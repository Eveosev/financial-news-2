Degremont, the water-treatment unit
of  Suez Environnement (SEV) , has begun producing drinking water from
modular desalination units that are converting brackish
groundwater in the Riyadh area of  Saudi Arabia .  The Suez subsidiary said today in a  statement  that the
production of drinking water from the first 5,000 cubic meter a
day unit started this month near the Dharhat Laban district and
would serve 3,000 households formerly supplied by tanker trucks.  Degremont won 40 million euros ($52 million) of contracts
last October from the National Water Company of Saudi Arabia for
the supply and installation of 33 modular units to produce
potable water from areas where fresh water resources are scarce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
