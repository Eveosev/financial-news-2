Canadian companies must
“aggressively pursue” new export markets to keep the country
from falling behind other nations, said Gordon Nixon, chief
executive officer of  Royal Bank of Canada .  “When it comes to going global, our businesses are falling
behind other industrialized nations,” Nixon, 56, said today at
the bank’s annual investor meeting in Calgary. “Our trade
patterns have barely changed since Confederation, and if we are
to achieve above average growth, we must increase overall export
activity with parts of the world that are actually growing.”  Nixon, head of Canada’s largest lender by assets, said
Canada must expand trade by moving beyond resources, taking a
“strategic approach” in areas such as agriculture, advanced
manufacturing, healthcare and technology. He also said Canadian
companies must improve productivity.  “Canadian companies must rev up their commitment and find
better ways to translate research and ideas into viable
commercial successes,” Nixon said.  Royal Bank earlier today reported first-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates on record earnings from consumer
lending and wealth management, and gains in investment banking.
Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose 12 percent to
