Amerisafe Inc. (AMSF) , the workers’
compensation insurer for industries including construction and
logging,  gained  the most since 2008 after fourth-quarter profit
beat analysts’ estimates.  The insurer climbed 12 percent to close at $32.62 in New
York, the top performance in the  Standard and Poor’s SmallCap
Financials Index . Deridder, Louisiana-based Amerisafe has
rallied 20 percent this year, compared with a 7.5 percent
increase in the 108-company index.  Fourth-quarter  net income  increased 14 percent to $9.23
million, Amerisafe said yesterday in a statement. Operating
profit, which excludes some investment results, was 49 cents per
share, beating the  average  39-cent estimate of four analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Premium revenue increased 19 percent to
$78.7 million.  “We think the company is continuing to benefit from both
rate and market-share gains in the high-hazard workers’ comp
market,” FBR Capital Markets analysts led by  Randy Binner  said
in a note yesterday. Binner has a market perform rating on the
shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
