Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened from the lowest level in more than a month as gains for
the motor fuel outpaced the biofuel.  The spread widened 3.81 cents to 50.96 cents a gallon on
speculation that production will exceed the “blend wall,” the
maximum amount of ethanol the nation can use in the gasoline
supply. Last year, demand was about 820,000 barrels a day,
Energy Information Administration data showed.  Output in the U.S. rose 1.9 percent last week to 812,000
barrels a day, the fourth straight weekly advance, the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said yesterday.  “Some traders think the blend wall will only allow so much
ethanol to be used in the future and that would keep a lid on
prices a little,” said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity analyst
at Futures International LLC in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for March delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.405 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures declined 2.2 percent in February. They gained 4.3
percent in February 2012.  Gasoline for March delivery, which expires today, rose 5.81
cents, or 2 percent, to $2.9146 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol. The price fell 3.7
percent in February.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,  for
corn-based ethanol  reached a record 53 cents yesterday,
according to Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in  New York . RINs are
credits that help the Environmental Protection Agency track
compliance with federal biofuel-use mandates, which call for
U.S. refiners to use 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or 900,000
barrels a day, this year and 14.4 billion next year.  Corn Prices  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 88 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Feb. 22, down from 90
percent the previous week, the EIA reported.  Ethanol rose from its lowest discount to gasoline since
Jan. 25 as corn for March delivery climbed 10 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $7.195 a bushel in Chicago. That’s the fourth
consecutive advance for the grain. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “Ethanol is higher because of higher corn prices and its
discount to the RBOB market,” Reilly said.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 21 cents,
compared with minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  The biofuel rose in all regions in cash market trading,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Spot prices advanced
0.5 cent to $2.525 a gallon in New York, 2 cents to $2.47 on the
 Gulf Coast , 2 cents to $2.60 a gallon on the West Coast and 3.5
cents to $2.415 in Chicago.  In  Sao Paulo , the fuel was $2.43 a gallon on the  spot
market  last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
