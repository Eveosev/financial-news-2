JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  opposed Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bid to force former JPMorgan trader
Bruno Iksil, the so-called London Whale, to answer questions in
an $8.6 billion lawsuit.  Lehman’s own employees have acknowledged that Iksil wasn’t
responsible for the derivatives trades cited by Lehman, JPMorgan
said in a federal court filing in Manhattan. JPMorgan termed
Lehman’s move an attempt to “harass” a key lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
