Palm oil fell for a seventh day, the
worst run in more than two months, on speculation that
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the largest producer after  Indonesia ,
will remain at high levels as exports decline.  The contract for May delivery dropped as much as 1.7
percent to 2,368 ringgit ($766) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, the lowest price for the most-active
contract since Jan. 14, and was at 2,394 ringgit at 4:14 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . The losing streak is the longest since Dec. 5,
taking declines to 6.4 percent this month.  Shipments from Malaysia should be allowed duty-free for
some companies until midyear to help reduce near-record
stockpiles, Sabri Ahmad, chief executive officer of Felda Global
Ventures Holdings Bhd., said in an interview yesterday.
Inventories in Malaysia last month were at 2.58 million tons,
holding near a record 2.63 million tons in December, according
to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Exports from Malaysia declined
9.1 percent to 1.33 million tons in February from 1.46 million
tons last month, surveyor Intertek said today.  “The decline in exports has raised concerns that
stockpiles in February will remain high,” said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at Kuala Lumpur-based brokerage Pelindung
Bestari Sdn. “The duty in March will deter demand for CPO
especially,” he said, referring to crude  palm oil  by its
initials.  Exports of CPO in March are set to be taxed at 4.5 percent
after two months of duty-free shipments. To spur a drop in the
stockpiles, Malaysia’s government replaced from Jan. 1 an export
tariff of about 23 percent and an annual duty-free quota with a
sliding-scale levy from 4.5 percent to 8.5 percent. With prices
below the threshold that triggers the lowest rate, shipments in
January and this month have been duty-free.  Soybean oil  for May delivery lost 0.6 percent to 49.39
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for May
delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $14.3675 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September declined 1.6
percent to end at 6,624  yuan  ($1,065) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange , the lowest price at close since Nov. 12.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month declined 0.4 percent
to 8,288 yuan a ton, the lowest price at close for the most-
active futures since September 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
