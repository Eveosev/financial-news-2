Wheat futures rose in Chicago for a
third straight day on speculation that demand is increasing
after the grain became a cheaper alternative to corn for cattle
rations on U.S. feedlots.  Corn is selling at a  premium  of 43.5 cents a bushel over
wheat at grain terminals near  Kansas City , compared with a
discount of $1.32 on Nov. 8, government data show. Wheat futures
fell 8.3 percent this month as snowstorms in the Great Plains
eased concern that drought would hurt crops in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  “We’re seeing a lot of feeding out here” of wheat as
prices fell, Darrell Holaday, the president of Advanced Market
Concepts in Wamego,  Kansas , said by telephone.  Wheat futures for delivery in May rose 0.4 percent to
settle at $7.145 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices on Feb. 26 touched $6.9775, the lowest for a most-
active contract since June 25.  U.S. wheat exports totaled 584,708 metric tons in the week
ended Feb. 21, up 13 percent from a week earlier, the Department
of Agriculture said in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
