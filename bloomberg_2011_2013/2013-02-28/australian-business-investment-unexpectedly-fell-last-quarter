Australian business investment
unexpectedly declined last quarter amid weakness in
manufacturing, while mining companies pared spending plans.  Capital spending  fell 1.2 percent from the third quarter,
when it rose a revised 1.1 percent, the Bureau of Statistics
said in Sydney today. That compares with the median forecast for
a 1 percent gain in a Bloomberg News survey of 19 economists.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor  Glenn Stevens  kept the
key  interest rate  unchanged at 3 percent this month, having cut
the benchmark 1.75 percentage points to 3 percent since November
2011 as the country’s resource boom approaches a crest. He said
in testimony to a parliamentary panel last week that industries
outside mining will have more room to grow, while adding the
transition from resource investment may not be  “seamless.”  “A peak in mining investment is looming, creating the need
for other sectors such as housing construction and non-mining
business investment to strengthen,”  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  chief
economist  Bill Evans , who predicted a 0.7 percent drop, said in
a research report before the release. “The precise timing of
this rebalancing and the smoothness of the transition remains
particularly uncertain.”  Credit Growth  Today’s report showed Australian companies forecast
investment of A$168.2 billion ($172 billion) in the year ending
June 30, which was 1.3 percent lower than their estimate three
months earlier. They predicted investment of A$152.5 billion in
2013-14. Australian mining investment in 2012-13 is projected at
A$105.1 billion, compared with A$108.1 billion three months
earlier. In 2013-14, mining companies estimate spending A$100.2
billion.  A separate report from the nation’s central bank showed
private-sector credit increased 0.2 percent in January from a
month earlier, and expanded 3.6 percent from a year earlier.
Lending to businesses was unchanged from a month earlier, the
data showed.  The local dollar bought $1.0244 at 12:02 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0227 before the release. Traders are pricing in a 25
percent chance the RBA will cut its main rate to a record-low
2.75 percent next week, swaps data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Today’s report showed spending on buildings and structures
fell 0.6 percent last quarter. Company investment in new plant
and equipment declined 2.3 percent, it showed.  Strong Dollar  The nation’s currency has remained above parity with the
 U.S. dollar  for eight months, the longest stretch since it was
freely floated in 1983, propelled by a mining boom and central
bank asset purchases in major developed nations. The current 3
percent cash rate matches a half-century low reached during the
2009 global recession.  “The economy will be adjusting to the peak of the mining
boom and some other areas of demand will have room to grow more
quickly than they have in recent years,” Stevens said in
parliamentary testimony Feb. 22. “This transition will not
necessarily be seamless, these things seldom are, but there are
reasonable prospects of it occurring over time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
