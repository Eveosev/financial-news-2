Soybeans rose the most in more than
a week after the government said U.S. exporters increased sales
to  China , the world’s biggest consumer. Corn headed for the
longest rally this month.  U.S.  exporter s sold 689,000 metric tons of soybeans in the
week ended Feb. 21 after two consecutive weeks of net
cancellations the Department of Agriculture said in a report
today. China accounted for 69 percent of the total, and the USDA
in a separate report said the nation bought another 123,000 tons
for delivery after Sept. 1. Premiums exporters paid for the
oilseed delivered to New Orleans jumped 4.6 percent yesterday,
the most in a month.  “Demand is improving for shrinking U.S. supplies,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des
Moines,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview. “Exporters and
crushers are fighting for last year’s drought-reduced
supplies.”  Soybean futures for May delivery climbed 1.2 percent to
$14.5675 a bushel at 10:14 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
heading for the biggest gain since Feb. 19. Still, a close at
that price would be the fifth monthly decline in six, on
forecasts for record harvests in South America to increase
supplies.  Soybean Meal  Soybean meal rose for a third straight day on increasing
overseas demand for the animal feed. U.S. exporters sold 250,295
tons in the week ended Feb. 21, the most in 10 weeks, the USDA
said.  Soybean-meal futures for May delivery jumped 1.8 percent to
$436.30 for 2,000 pounds, heading for a second straight monthly
gain.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 1.3 percent to $7.04
a bushel in  Chicago , heading for the first four-day rally since
Jan. 31. A close at that price would mark a monthly drop of 5
percent, on speculation that record crops in South America will
relieve tight global supplies after the worst U.S. drought in
more than seven decades cut production 13 percent last year.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $77.4 billion in
2012, followed by soybeans at $43.2 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
