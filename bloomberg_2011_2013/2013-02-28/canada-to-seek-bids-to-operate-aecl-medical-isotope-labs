Canada will seek bids from private
companies to operate Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.’s nuclear
laboratories, Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver said.  The federal government plans to restructure the management
and operation of the laboratories to adopt a model under which
the government will own the facilities and a private contractor
will run them, Oliver said in a statement released today. The
labs, located in Chalk River, Ont., produce medical isotopes
that help to treat diseases such as cancer.  A reactor at the labs supplies isotopes to companies such
as  Nordion Inc. (NDN)  of Ottawa. The government shut down the reactor
for repairs in 2009 for more than a year.  Canada sold AECL’s CANDU reactor division in 2011 to  SNC-
Lavalin Group Inc. (SNC) , a Montreal-based construction and
engineering company based in  Montreal . The government is
assessing whether to invest in “longer-term nuclear
innovation,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
