Portugal ’s decision to ask for more
time to narrow its  budget deficit  is justifiable given that
other countries have done the same, European Central Bank Vice
President  Vitor Constancio  said.  “There are many recent precedents in relationship to Spain
and France,” Constancio told reporters in Brussels today.
“Judging from the precedents, the issue is pertinent and I
understand the position the government took on this matter.”  Portuguese Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Feb. 20
that Portugal may get an additional year to narrow its budget
deficit as the country’s economy remains mired in recession.
Last year, Gaspar announced an “enormous” increase in taxes to
narrow the budget deficit to 4.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2013 and below the European Union’s 3 percent limit
next year.  Constancio, a former Bank of Portugal governor, said it 
would be up to the European Commission and not the ECB to 
decide on granting Portugal more time to cut the budget 
deficit. Officials from the European Commission, the ECB and 
the  International Monetary Fund  are currently in Lisbon to 
carry out the seventh quarterly review of Portugal’s 
78 billion-euro ($102 billion) aid program.  “This is not a problem of creditors, it is a problem of
rules the commission has to interpret and decide upon,”
Constancio said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
