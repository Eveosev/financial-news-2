Inter RAO Lietuva AB rose to the
highest level since it started trading in Warsaw in December
after the Baltic power trader reported a smaller-than-expected
drop in 2012 profit.  The stock rose 6.9 percent to 28.99 zloty at the close in
Warsaw, extending this year’s gain to 8.8 percent and valuing
the company at 580 million zloty ($183 million). The volume of
shares traded was double the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Vilnius, Lithuania-based unit of  Russia ’s state-
controlled electricity company  OAO Inter RAO UES (IRAO)  had net income
of 58.1 million litai ($22 million) last year, compared with
61.2 million litai in 2011, it said in a regulatory filing late
yesterday.  “The fact that 2012 profit fell barely 5 percent is a
quite decent result given investors’ really negative
expectations,” Tadas Povilauskas, an analyst at Finasta
investment bank in Vilnius, said by e-mail. “This leaves enough
accumulated profit for an attractive dividend yield of nearly 8
percent.”  Declining Russian power imports to the Baltics and fears
the company’s first post-IPO earnings report might reveal “bad
news” weighed on investors’ expectations, Povilauskas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
