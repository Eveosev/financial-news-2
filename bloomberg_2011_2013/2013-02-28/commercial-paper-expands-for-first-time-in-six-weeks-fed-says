The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  expanded for the first time in six
weeks, boosted by an increase in issuance from U.S. financial
institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
rose $200 million to $1.0631 trillion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the Federal Reserve said today on its website.
Thatâ€™s the first increase since the period ended Jan. 16 when
the market surged $27.8 billion.  Commercial paper  issued by U.S.-based banks  also rose for
the first time in six weeks, climbing $6.7 billion to $317.4
billion outstanding, according to the Fed. Corporations sell
commercial paper, typically maturing in 270 days or less, to
fund everyday activities such as rent and salaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
