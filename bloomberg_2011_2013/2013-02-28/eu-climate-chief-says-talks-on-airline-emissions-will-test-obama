European Union Climate Commissioner
 Connie Hedegaard  said an early test of President Barack Obama’s
commitment to combating  climate change  is how he negotiates an
international agreement on aviation emissions.  “I really believe that when it’s about finding a global
way forward for aviation now, we -- the U.S. and the European
Union -- should be on the same side, working for the obvious,
namely that if I take a long-haul plane, be it from Washington
to Europe or from Europe to Beijing, it is only common sense
that I pay for my pollution,” Hedegaard told reporters today at
a briefing in Washington.  Obama’s pledges to fight climate change in his second
inaugural address and the  State of the Union  speech were “sweet
music to a European’s ears,” the Danish politician said. Now
the EU wants the administration to say specifically how it would
seek to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from airplanes and other
sources, she said.  She said an administration rejection of the proposed
Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to refineries
along the U.S. Gulf Coast would send a “strong signal to the
world” about how serious the administration is in addressing
climate risks. Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because
they say it would encourage development of the  tar sands , the
mining of which releases more  greenhouse gases  than most
conventional drilling.  Hedegaard is in Washington for meetings with Obama
administration officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
