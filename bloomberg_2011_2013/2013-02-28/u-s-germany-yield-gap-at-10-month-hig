Treasury 10-year notes gained for
the first month since November as investors sought safety amid
turmoil in Europe and the  Federal Reserve  reinforced its
commitment to buying government debt to support the economy.  The 10-year yield  fell  the most in a month since July as
investors bet the start of $85 billion in automatic federal
spending cuts tomorrow will hurt the U.S. economic recovery,
boosting the case for monetary stimulus. Bonds rose today as
data showed the economy grew less than forecast in the fourth
quarter.  Japan  overtook  China  last year as the largest foreign
holder of U.S. securities, the Treasury Department said. Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers this week a premature
interest-rate increase would snuff out the recovery.  “Bernanke’s testimony this week emboldened the market that
rates will be low for a considerable period of time,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in  New York  at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “He’s doing everything in his power to
keep rates low.”  The 10-year  yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.88 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices, below its 50-day
moving average of 1.89 percent. The yield touched 1.84 percent
on Feb. 26, the lowest level since Jan. 24. The price of the 2
percent security due in February 2023 rose 7/32, or $2.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 101 1/8.  The yield dropped 11 basis points in February.  The Fed’s benchmark  interest-rate  target has been zero to
0.25 percent since 2008 to support the economy.  Italian Elections  U.S. debt  was also supported by month-end buying to match
market indexes. Funds that manage portfolios against benchmark
indexes, including the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index, typically
buy longer-maturity Treasuries near month-end to align the
interest-rate sensitivity of their holdings with the indexes.  The Barclays index, which many funds use to measure their
performance, will extend its duration, the measure of rate-
sensitivity, by 0.11 year on March 1.  Ten-year yields have fallen nine basis points this  week ,
the second straight five-day decrease, after Italian
parliamentary elections Feb. 24-25 failed to give any party a
clear majority. That cast doubt on the stability of the next
government and spurred bets the country’s commitment to
austerity may be diluted, worsening  Europe ’s debt crisis.  “The reason we popped out of the hole was because of the
Italian elections,” Mitsubishi UFJ’s Roth said.  Yield Curve  The difference between the yields on two-year and 10-year
notes, called the yield curve, narrowed to 1.64 percentage
points, approaching the 1.63 percentage-point level reached Feb.
25, the smallest on a closing basis since Jan. 24. It dropped
from a 2013 high of 1.76 percentage points reached on Feb. 19.  Treasuries have returned 0.5 percent this month as of
yesterday, after losing 1 percent in January, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. They have declined 0.4 percent
this year. German bonds gained 1.3 percent in February.  The 10-year term premium, a model that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, reached
negative 0.73 percent, almost the most costly since Jan. 23. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Bernanke signaled in congressional testimony this week the
Fed is prepared to keep buying bonds at its present pace as he
dismissed concerns record easing risks sparking inflation or
fueling asset price bubbles. He told lawmakers the central
bank’s policies are helping to improve demand for homes and cars
by lowering long-term interest rates.  Monthly Purchases  The Fed is purchasing $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage-
backed securities each month in an effort to spur the economy
and cut a jobless rate that was 7.9 percent in January.  The bank bought $1.45 billion today of debt maturing from
February 2036 up to August 2042. It said it will purchase $45
billion of Treasuries in March, including as much as $1 billion
tomorrow of bonds due from August 2023 to February 2031.  The automatic U.S. spending cuts set to go into effect
tomorrow unless Congress heads them off, which total $1.2
trillion over nine years, may lower gross domestic product by
0.6 percentage point and cost 750,000 jobs by the end of 2013,
according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  Far Apart  Treasuries rose today as revised data from the Commerce
Department showed U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 0.1
percent annual rate from October through December, up from a
previously estimated 0.1 percent drop. The median forecast of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.5 percent gain.  The advance was tempered as investor risk appetite improved
after the MNI Chicago Report gauge of U.S. business rose to 56.8
this month, the highest level since March. Initial claims for
jobless benefits in the U.S. decreased by 22,000 to 344,000 last
week, the Labor Department said.  Japan’s total holdings of U.S. securities grew to $1.84
trillion at the end of June 2012, from $1.59 trillion a year
earlier. China’s holdings fell to $1.59 trillion from $1.73
trillion, Treasury said today in a preliminary report.  The Treasury said a preliminary report of U.S. holdings of
foreign securities is expected to be released by Aug. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
