The following is the text of the
industrial product and raw material prices report as reported
by Statistics  Canada .  In January, the Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI)
remained at the same level as in December. Lower prices for
chemical products largely offset gains elsewhere, including an
advance in petroleum and coal products. The Raw Materials Price
Index (RMPI) rebounded with a 3.8% gain, mostly because of
higher prices for crude oil.  Industrial Product Price Index, monthly change  The IPPI remained at the same level for a second
consecutive month in January. Of the 21 major commodity groups,
10 were up, 8 were down, and 3 were unchanged.  Chemical products (-1.4%) posted the largest decline,
mainly attributable to lower prices for organic industrial
chemicals (-4.7%). It was the first decrease since September
2012 for chemical products.  Primary metal products (-0.6%) also declined, as a result
of lower prices for aluminum products (-2.7%) and other non-
ferrous metal products (-0.8%).  Among the other commodity groups that posted decreases was
fruit, vegetables, feeds and other food products (-0.5%), pushed
downward primarily by feeds (-1.9%).  Conversely, petroleum and coal products (+0.7%) posted the
largest gain. The advance was mainly the result of higher prices
for fuel oil and other fuels (+1.9%) and gasoline (+0.9%).  Higher prices were also observed for lumber and other wood
products (+1.2%), largely because of lumber and ties (+3.0%),
which posted a third consecutive increase.  Among the other commodities that registered gains was meat,
fish and dairy products (+0.9%), which increased as a result of
higher prices for meat products (+1.8%).  Industrial Product Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with January 2012, the IPPI was down 0.2%.  The decrease of the index was led by primary metal products
(-3.1%), which fell mainly because of lower prices for aluminum
products (-6.9%), iron and steel products (-2.7%) and nickel
products (-13.7%).  Motor vehicles and other transportation equipment (-1.0%)
also contributed to the year-over-year decline of the IPPI. The
decrease was primarily a result of the appreciation of the
Canadian dollar against the US dollar compared with January 2012.  Some Canadian producers who export their products report
their prices in US dollars. Consequently, the 2.1% year-over-
year increase in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to
the US dollar may have the effect of lowering the IPPI. Without
the measurable effect of the exchange rate, the index would have
risen 0.3% instead of falling 0.2%.  Among the other commodities that contributed to the
downward movement of the IPPI were chemical products (-1.7%) and
petroleum and coal products (-1.0%).  The decline of the IPPI was moderated primarily by an
increase in lumber and other wood products (+9.0%), largely a
result of higher prices for lumber and ties (+15.0%).  Raw Materials Price Index, monthly change  The RMPI rose 3.8% in January, the first advance since
September 2012 and the largest gain of the index since November
2011. All major product groups except one were up.  The increase of the RMPI was mainly led by higher prices
for mineral fuels (+8.1%), specifically crude oil (+8.5%). The
RMPI excluding mineral fuels edged up 0.3% in January.  Among the other commodity groups that exerted upward
pressure on the RMPI was ferrous materials (+4.0%). The increase
was mostly attributable to iron ore (+8.7%).  The growth of the RMPI in January was moderated slightly by
non-ferrous metals (-0.6%), which declined mainly because of
lower prices for other non-ferrous base metals (-1.9%), zinc
concentrates (-1.6%) and precious metals (-1.2%).  Raw Materials Price Index, 12-month change  Compared with the same month one year earlier, the RMPI was
down 4.7%, continuing the downward trend observed since March
2012.  The decline of the RMPI was largely attributable to mineral
fuels (-9.9%), specifically crude oil (-10.3%), which was down
for an 11th consecutive month on a year-over-year basis. The
RMPI excluding mineral fuels rose 0.5%, the second consecutive
increase on a year-over-year basis.  Other commodity groups that contributed to the decrease of
the RMPI included non-ferrous metals (-1.1%) and ferrous
materials (-6.3%).  Compared with January 2012, the decline of the RMPI was
moderated slightly by vegetable products (+5.8%) and wood
products (+2.6%).  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally unadjusted and
usually subject to revision for a period of six months (for
example, when the July index is released, the index for the
previous January becomes final).  The Industrial Product Price Index (IPPI) reflects the
prices that producers in Canada receive as the goods leave the
plant gate. It does not reflect what the consumer pays. Unlike
the Consumer Price Index, the IPPI excludes indirect taxes and
all the costs that occur between the time a good leaves the
plant and the time the final user takes possession of it,
including the transportation, wholesale, and retail costs.  Canadian producers export many goods. They often indicate
their prices in foreign currencies, especially in US dollars,
which are then converted into Canadian dollars. In particular,
this is the case for motor vehicles, pulp, paper and wood
products. Therefore, a rise or fall in the value of the Canadian
dollar against its US counterpart affects the IPPI. But the
conversion into Canadian dollars only reflects how respondents
provide their prices. This is not a measure that takes the full
effect of exchange rates into account.  The conversion of prices received in US dollars is based on
the average monthly exchange rate (noon spot rate) established
by the Bank of Canada, and it is available on CANSIM in table
176-0064 (series v37426). Monthly and annual variations in the
exchange rate, as described in the release, are calculated
according to the indirect quotation of the exchange rate (for
example, CAN$1 = US$X).  The Raw Materials Price Index (RMPI) reflects the prices
paid by Canadian manufacturers for key raw materials. Many of
those prices are set on the world market. However, as few prices
are denominated in foreign currencies, their conversion into
Canadian dollars has only a minor effect on the calculation of
the RMPI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
