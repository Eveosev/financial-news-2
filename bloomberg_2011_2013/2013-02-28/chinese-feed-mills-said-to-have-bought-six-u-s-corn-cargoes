Chinese feed mills bought six
cargoes of U.S. corn for delivery starting in September as users
lock in future shipments that are cheaper than shorter-term
purchases, said four executives in the grains industry with
direct knowledge of the transactions.  The cargoes include at least 120,000 metric tons bought
last week and total more than 300,000 tons, said the executives,
who asked not to be identified because the deals are private.
Feed mills and large livestock producers in southern  China  are
among the buyers, they said. The executives requested that the
sellers and purchasers not be named.  Suppliers of U.S. corn quoted about $297 (1,849  yuan ) a
ton, or 2,100 yuan including import taxes, for arrival in
southern China from September, they said.  September corn on northern Chinaâ€™s Dalian Commodity
Exchange traded at 2,439 yuan a ton at 11:30 a.m. local time.
The most active contract in  Chicago , for delivery in May, traded
$6.9725 a bushel, while the September contract was $5.7825 a
bushel.  China  bought  a record of 5.23 million tons of corn from
overseas in the marketing year ended Sept. 30, and shipments
this year are forecast to fall to 2.5 million tons, according to
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
