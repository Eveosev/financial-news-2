Indonesia’s rupiah is set for the
best month since January 2012 after global investors bolstered
holdings of the nation’s stocks by the most since April 2011.
 Government bonds  declined.  Foreign funds bought $1.1 billion more local shares than
they sold in February, exchange data show, helping drive the
 Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  to an all-time high today. Overseas
money managers added 7.31 trillion rupiah ($756 million) to
their ownership of rupiah-denominated sovereign debt this month
through Feb. 26, according to official figures. The economy may
expand 6.3 percent this year, compared with 6.2 percent in 2012,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  “The rupiah’s strengthening has been driven by demand from
foreign funds for local assets,” said Mika Martumpal, a
currency analyst at PT Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “Investors
are still seeking higher returns where they can find it, and
they see strong growth potential in  Indonesia .”  The rupiah advanced 0.7 percent this month to 9,667 per
dollar as of 3:21 p.m. in Jakarta in the best currency gain in
 Asia , according to prices from local banks. It traded at a 0.03
percent premium to the one-month non-deliverable forwards, which
rose 1 percent this month to 9,670, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,669 today, from 9,687 yesterday, by the Association of Banks
in  Singapore . The contracts gained 0.3 percent today and 1.6
percent for the year, while the spot rate advanced 0.2 percent
today and declined 0.3 percent in 2013.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 44 basis points, or 0.44 percentage point, this month to
5.65 percent.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 climbed one basis point in February to 5.34 percent, prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association show. The yield was
little changed today and rose 16 basis points this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
