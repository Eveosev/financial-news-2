The world economy is threatened by a
“long, uncertain pause” in the development and spread of
financial markets, according to McKinsey & Co.  Almost six years since the start of the worst financial
turmoil since the Great Depression, finance is at an
“inflection” point between turning more domestic or reviving
its pre-crisis globalization push, the management consultant’s
research division said in a report published today.  Cross-border capital flows are 60 percent below their peak
and euro-area banks have reduced foreign claims by $3.7
trillion, while annual growth in financial assets has slowed to
1.9 percent from 7.9 percent in the 17 years before the crisis,
according to the McKinsey Global Institute. The development of
financial systems has fallen behind economic growth in many
 emerging markets .  “The risk now is that continued slow growth in global
financial assets may slow the economic recovery, stifling
business investment, homeownership and investment in innovation
and infrastructure,” the institute said in the study based on
the assets of 183 nations.  If the current trend continues, the value of financial
assets relative to gross domestic product will flatten or even
decline by 2020, the report said. Policy makers need to act by
completing regulatory reform, creating borrowing mechanisms for
constrained borrowers and generating more stability for finance
across countries, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
