American States Water Co. (AWR) , a
California-based water service and electricity provider,
reported a 53 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, boosted
by projects at military bases in North Carolina and Texas.  Water and wastewater pipelines, meter projects and
replacement works at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and  Fort Bliss 
in Texas helped raise revenue as quarterly profit climbed to
$10.3 million from $6.7 million a year earlier, the San Dimas-
based utility said today in a statement.  American States Water is the parent of Golden State Water
Company and American States Utility Services Inc. Its shares
have risen 48 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
