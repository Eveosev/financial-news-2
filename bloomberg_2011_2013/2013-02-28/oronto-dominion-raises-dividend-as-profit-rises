Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest lender, said first-quarter profit climbed 21
percent on higher Canadian and U.S. consumer bank results. The
bank raised its quarterly dividend.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose to C$1.79
billion ($1.75 billion), or C$1.86 a share, from C$1.48 billion,
or C$1.55, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender said today
in a statement. Adjusted earnings, which exclude some one-time
items, were C$2 a share, beating the C$1.93 average  estimate  of
15 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The results exceeded our expectations and were
particularly impressive when you consider the challenging
operating and economic environment,” Chief Executive Officer
 Edmund Clark , 65, said in the statement.  Toronto-Dominion rose 0.2 percent to close yesterday at
C$84.29 in Toronto trading. The shares have risen less than 1
percent this year, trailing the 4.1 percent advance of the 10-
company  S&P/TSX Banks Index. (STBANKX)   Toronto-Dominion boosted its quarterly  payout  5.2 percent
to 81 cents a share, the third increase in the past two years.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. Toronto
