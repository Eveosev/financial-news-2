The  San Francisco 49ers  have talked
about making a trade for New York Jets All-Pro cornerback
 Darrelle Revis ,  Yahoo Sports reported , citing two unidentified
people familiar with the situation.  The 49ers are set to have 15 picks in April’s National
Football League draft and may be one of the few teams with the
flexibility to compensate the Jets for Revis, Yahoo said.  San Francisco currently has 11 draft picks, would get one
more in the trade sending quarterback  Alex Smith  to the Kansas
City Chiefs, and are projected to get three additional
selections as compensation for players they lost as free agents
last season, Yahoo said. The Jets were actively shopping Revis
to other clubs at the NFL scouting combine last week, according
to the New York Daily News, and may be looking to restock their
roster with draft picks.  Revis, 27, was selected as an All-Pro in three of his first
five NFL seasons and has been regarded by some analysts as the
best defensive player in the NFL when healthy. He is coming off
a season in which he was limited to two games after tearing a
knee ligament and ESPN has said he may be seeking as much as $16
million a year. The 49ers’ defense allowed the second-fewest
points in the NFL last season, when they reached the  Super Bowl 
before losing to the Baltimore Ravens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
