NPO Uralvagonzavod OAO of Russia
placed no binding offer for  Zelezara Smederevo d.o.o. , Serbia’s
sole steel producer, by today’s deadline, Serbia’s  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  The Serbian government will discuss the sale of the
unprofitable producer tomorrow and won’t extend the deadline for
placing bids for a third time, according to the statement.  Uralvagonzavod was the only company to have expressed
interest in the Smederevo-based plant, which  U.S. Steel Corp. (X) 
sold back to Serbia for $1 in January 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
