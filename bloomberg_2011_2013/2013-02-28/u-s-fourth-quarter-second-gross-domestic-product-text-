Following is the text release from
the GDP report:
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT:  FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL 2012 (SECOND
ESTIMATE)  Real gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services
produced by
labor and property located in the  United States  -- increased at
an annual rate
of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 (that is, from the
third quarter to
the fourth quarter), according to the “second” estimate released
by the
 Bureau of Economic Analysis .  In the third quarter, real GDP
increased 3.1
percent.  The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source
data than were
available for the “advance” estimate issued last month.  In the
advance estimate,
real GDP declined 0.1 percent.  The upward revision to the
percent change in real
GDP is smaller than the average revision from the advance to
second estimate of
0.5 percentage point.  While today痴 release has revised the
direction of change in
real GDP, the general picture of the economy for the fourth
quarter remains largely
the same as what was presented last month (for more information,
see “Revisions”
on page 3).  The increase in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily
reflected positive
contributions from personal consumption expenditures (PCE),
nonresidential fixed
investment, and residential fixed investment that were partly
offset by negative
contributions from private inventory investment, federal
 government spending ,
exports, and state and local government spending.  Imports,
which are a subtraction
in the calculation of GDP, decreased.  The deceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily
reflected downturns
in private inventory investment, in federal government spending,
in exports, and in
state and local government spending that were partly offset by
an upturn in
nonresidential fixed investment, a larger decrease in imports,
and an acceleration
in PCE.  Final sales of computers added 0.10 percentage point to the
fourth-quarter change
in real GDP after adding 0.11 percentage point to the third-
quarter change.
Motor vehicle output added 0.19 percentage point to the fourth-
quarter change in
real GDP after subtracting 0.25 percentage point from the third-
quarter change.  The  price index  for gross domestic purchases, which measures
prices paid by U.S.
residents, increased 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.2
percentage point more
than in the advance estimate; this index increased 1.4 percent
in the third quarter.
Excluding food and energy prices, the price index for gross
domestic purchases
increased 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an
increase of 1.2
percent in the third.  Real personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1 percent in
the fourth quarter,
Compared with an increase of 1.6 percent in the third.  Durable
goods increased
13.8 percent, compared with an increase of 8.9 percent.
Nondurable goods increased
0.1 percent, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent.
Services increased 0.9 percent, compared with an increase of 0.6
percent.  Real nonresidential fixed investment increased 9.7 percent in
the fourth quarter,
in contrast to a decrease of 1.8 percent in the third.
Nonresidential structures
increased 5.8 percent; it was unchanged in the third quarter.
Equipment and software
increased 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to a
decrease of 2.6
percent in the third.  Real residential fixed investment
increased 17.5 percent,
compared with an increase of 13.5 percent.  Real exports of goods and services decreased 3.9 percent in the
fourth quarter,
in contrast to an increase of 1.9 percent in the third.  Real
imports of goods
and services decreased 4.5 percent, compared
with a decrease of 0.6 percent.  Real federal government consumption expenditures and gross
investment decreased
14.8 percent in the fourth quarter, in contrast to an increase
of 9.5 percent in
the third.  National defense decreased 22.0 percent, in contrast
to an increase
of 12.9 percent.  Nondefense increased 1.8 percent, compared
with an increase of
3.0 percent.  Real state and local government consumption
expenditures and gross
investment decreased 1.3 percent, in contrast to an increase of
0.3 percent.  The change in real private inventories subtracted 1.55
percentage points from the
fourth-quarter change in real GDP, after adding 0.73 percentage
point to the
third-quarter change.  Private businesses increased inventories
$12.0 billion in
the fourth quarter, following increases of $60.3 billion in the
third
and $41.4 billion in the second.  Real final sales of domestic product -- GDP less change in
private inventories --
increased 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with an
increase of 2.4
percent in the third.  Gross domestic purchases  Real gross domestic purchases -- purchases by U.S. residents of
goods and services
Wherever produced -- decreased 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter,
in contrast to an
increase of 2.6 percent in the third.
Current-dollar GDP  Current-dollar GDP -- the market value of the nation’s output of
goods and services
-- increased 1.0 percent, or $40.2 billion, in the fourth
quarter to a level of
$15,851.2 billion.  In the third quarter, current-dollar GDP
increased 5.9 percent,
or $225.4 billion.  Revisions  The “second” estimate of the fourth-quarter percent change in
GDP is 0.2 percentage
point, or $9.2 billion, more than the advance estimate issued
last month, primarily
reflecting an upward revision to exports, a downward revision to
imports, and an
upward revision to nonresidential fixed investment that were
partly offset by a
downward revision to private inventory investment.  2012 GDP  Real GDP increased 2.2 percent in 2012 (that is, from the 2011
annual level to the
2012 annual level), compared with an increase of 1.8 percent in
2011.  The increase in real GDP in 2012 primarily reflected positive
contributions from personal
consumption expenditures (PCE), nonresidential fixed investment,
exports, residential fixed investment, and private inventory
investment that were partly offset by negative contributions
from federal government spending and from state and local
government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the
calculation of GDP, increased.  The acceleration in real GDP in 2012 primarily reflected a
deceleration in imports, upturns in
residential fixed investment and in private inventory investment
and smaller decreases in state and local government spending and
in federal government spending that were partly offset by
decelerations in PCE, exports, and nonresidential fixed
investment.  The price index for gross domestic purchases increased 1.7
percent in 2012, compared with an
increase of 2.5 percent in 2011.  Current-dollar GDP increased 4.0 percent, or $605.8 billion, in
2012 to a level of $15,681.5
billion, compared with an increase of 4.0 percent, or $576.8
billion, in 2011.  During 2012 (that is, measured from the fourth quarter of 2011
to the fourth quarter of 2012),
real GDP increased 1.6 percent.  Real GDP increased 2.0 percent
during 2011.  The price index for gross domestic purchases
increased 1.5 percent during 2012, compared with an increase of
2.5 percent during 2011.  Next release -- March 28, 2013 at 8:30 A.M. EDT for:
