Thailand ’s government bonds and the
baht completed a monthly advance as global funds increased
holdings to take advantage of higher yields.  The benchmark 10-year yield reached a two-week low
yesterday as Thai Bond Market Association  data  showed
international investors bought $2.4 billion more sovereign debt
than they sold in February. Thailand’s 10-year bonds yielded 3.6
percent, compared with 1.89 percent for similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries and 0.66 percent in  Japan . Central bank data today
showed  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest economy had a current
account deficit of $2.2 billion in January, compared with an
excess of $730 million in December.  “The trend remains intact that funds are flowing to the
region to seek for higher yields,” said  Tsutomu Soma , fixed-
income business unit manager at Rakuten Securities Inc. in
 Tokyo . “Demand for the baht and the dollar seems to be quite
balanced amid increasing portfolio inflows and growing
imports.”  The yield on the 3.625 percent government notes due June
2023 fell 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, this month
to 3.6 percent as of 3:14 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The rate rose two basis points today. It
reached 3.58 percent yesterday, the least since Feb. 11.  Industrial production climbed 10 percent in January, after
a revised increase of 23 percent in December, according to a
report today by the Office of Industrial Economics. It said the
manufacturing production index will rise between 3.5 percent and
4.5 percent this year compared with a 2.51 percent gain last
year.  The baht strengthened 0.3 percent from a month ago and
today to 29.74 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, added nine basis points
today to 5.38 percent, taking this month’s increase to 39 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
