Rubber rebounded from the lowest
level since December, paring the first monthly loss in four,
after a producer group representing the three largest exporters
said it may extend export restrictions to support prices.  The contract for delivery in August advanced as much as 2.5
percent to 295.3 yen a kilogram ($3,191 a metric ton) before
trading at 293.9 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:20
a.m. Futures have lost 6.9 percent this month, heading for the
worst performance since May.  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and  Malaysia  may extend shipment cuts
if prices drop below $3 per kilogram when the program ends in
March, Darmansyah Basyaruddin, chief executive officer at the
International Rubber Consortium, told reporters at seminar in
Jakarta yesterday. The price in Tokyo dropped to 284.8 yen
yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 21.  “Caution about supply restrictions prevented further
losses in rubber futures,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at
research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Thailand, the largest producer, agreed with Indonesia and
Malaysia last year to cut exports by a combined 300,000 tons in
the six months through March. The action came after prices
slumped to an almost three-year low of 205.6 yen in August.  Futures also gained after data showed today  Japan ’s
industrial production rose for a second month in January,
raising speculation demand will grow, Shigemoto said. Output
climbed 1 percent from December, when it rose 2.4 percent,
according to the trade ministry.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 1.1 percent to 24,775  yuan  ($3,978) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board declined 1.1 percent to 88.7 baht ($2.97) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
