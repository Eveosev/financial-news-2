The  Dominican Republic ’s central
bank held the  benchmark interest rate  unchanged for a sixth
consecutive month as policy makers seek to nurture credit
expansion in the Caribbean’s largest economy.  Policy makers led by central bank President Hector Valdez Albizu held the rate at 5 percent today after lowering the
benchmark 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage points, since May
2012. The economy grew 3.9 percent last year, below potential,
the bank said.  “Credit to the private sector in local currency continues
recovering and projections suggest that at year-end financing
will be growing faster than output,” according to a statement
posted on the bank’s website. “Greater credit would permit a
faster recovery in consumption and private investment, helping
output expand at a pace closer to potential.”  Consumer prices rose 1.3 percent in January and 4.8 percent
in the previous 12 months, within the bank’s target of 5 percent
plus or minus 1 percentage point. Tax changes approved last
year, including a value-added tax increase to 18 percent from 16
percent, caused inflation to jump in January, Bernardo Fuentes,
economist at Santo Domingo-based consulting firm Economi-K SA,
said in a phone interview.  “Inflation won’t keep up that rhythm as the central bank
will work to control it in upcoming months,” Fuentes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
