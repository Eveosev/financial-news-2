Hines, an international real estate
developer, increased its ownership of the $700 million
 CityCenterDC  project in Washington after buying the stake held
by Archstone Inc., their partner in the deal.  Hines announced the acquisition a day after apartment
owners  AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB)  and  Equity Residential (EQR)  said
they completed their purchase of Archstone in a cash-and-stock
deal valued at $16 billion. Terms weren’t disclosed.  “We have enjoyed working with Archstone and are proud to
complete and manage this momentous development for D.C.,” Jeff Hines, president of Houston-based Hines, said in a statement.  Hines will develop two apartment buildings comprising 458
units at CityCenterDC. The District of Columbia in 2003 chose
Hines and Archstone to develop the 10-acre (4-hectare) project
on the grounds of Washington’s old convention center.
Construction began in 2011. The plans also include condominiums,
offices, retail and hotel rooms.  Hines’s multifamily residential development business,
established two years ago, has about 5,500 units valued at about
$1 billion in various stages of construction in 12 U.S. cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
