Sika AG (SIK) , the world’s largest maker
of construction chemicals, said it’s unlikely to reach a medium-
term sales growth target of as much as 10 percent as  Europe ’s
debt woes weigh on the region’s builders.  The maker of Sikaflex sealant is now predicting 4 percent
to 6 percent growth amid a “continuing uncertain situation” in
Europe, it said today. Sales increased 5.8 percent to 4.8
billion francs ($5.2 billion) in 2012, the Baar, Switzerland-
based company said today, in line with analysts’ estimates.  The company is ramping up activity in  South America  from
 Brazil  to Argentina to offset a construction slump in Europe,
which accounted for about half of the company’s revenue in 2011.  “Management is adopting a somewhat less upbeat tone when
guiding for medium term growth,” Patrick Laager, an analyst at
Credit Suisse in Zurich said in a note to clients. “We also
believe that Sika may opt for more external growth
opportunities.”  Sika confirmed targets for earnings before interest taxes,
amortization and depreciation and for net income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
