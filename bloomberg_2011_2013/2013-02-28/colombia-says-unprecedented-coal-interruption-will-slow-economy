Colombia  said a three-pronged
interruption of its coal industry, South America’s largest, is
curbing  tax revenue  and dimming growth prospects.  The shutdown of three of Colombia’s four largest mine
complexes is affecting 79 percent of the country’s output and
costing 192,000 metric tons of exports a day, Javier Garcia,
head of corporate mining at the Mining and Energy Ministry, said
in an interview from Bogota last night. Coal is Colombia’s
second-biggest source of foreign revenue.  “The gravity of this crisis is unprecedented,” he said.
“The consequences will certainly be felt in our gross domestic
product.”  Colombia is losing 6 billion pesos ($3.3 million) of public
revenues a day because of a strike at Cerrejon, partly owned by
 BHP Billiton (BHP)  Ltd, an export ban on Drummond Co. and the
termination of the operating contract at the La Francia mine
owned by  Goldman Sachs (GS)  Group Inc., Garcia said. The shutdowns,
which began when Cerrejon workers downed tools Feb. 8 over pay,
have caused 4 million tons of lost production, or 18 percent of
the government’s quarterly output target, he said.  Cerrejon is losing about 95,000 tons of exports a day, said
Juan Carlos Restrepo, the mine’s spokesman in Bogota. Drummond,
based in Birmingham, Alabama, is losing about 80,000 tons based
on last year’s figures, said Wilma Calderon, an external press
representative in Bogota.  Michael DuVally , a Goldman Sachs
spokesman in New York, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
