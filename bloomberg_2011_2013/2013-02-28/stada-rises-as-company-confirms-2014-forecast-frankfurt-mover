Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ) ,  Germany ’s
biggest publicly traded generic-drug maker, rose to the highest
price in 21 months after the company confirmed its forecast for
next year.  Stada climbed as much as 5.1 percent and traded 2.5 percent
higher at 29.70 euros as of 2:12 p.m. in  Frankfurt , the highest
intraday price since May 12, 2011. That gives the company a
market value of 1.76 billion euros ($2.3 billion). The stock has
gained 31 percent in the past year including reinvested
dividends, compared with a 14 percent return for the CDAX
Performance Index. Almost 345,000 shares were traded, slightly
more than the three-month average.  Net income excluding some items in 2014 will reach 215
million euros “at minimum,” Bad Vilbel, Germany-based Stada
said in a statement today, confirming previous forecasts for
profit and sales. Analysts had been predicting adjusted net
income of 193.6 million euros, according to  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Stada said it will pay a 2012 dividend of 50 euro cents per
share, compared with 37 euro cents in the previous year. Sales
last year climbed 7 percent to 1.84 billion euros and net income
almost quadrupled to 86.5 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
