The performance of  Brazil ’s national
soccer team is more of a worry for the 2014 World Cup’s
organizers than the readiness of the 12 stadiums hosting the
event, Sports Minister Aldo Rebelo said today.  Brazil’s team lost 2-1 against  England  this month in its
first friendly match under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari, known as
Felipao, who took over in November 2012 to help boost the team
with a history of five World Cup victories, the most of any
nation. Brazil’s last victory was in 2002.  “Regarding the stadiums, I supervise and control them, I
talk to the builders,” Rebelo said in an interview in Brasilia.
“Regarding the team, I can only root for Felipao and the
players. It’s the only project where the government has no
influence.”  The general secretary of soccer’s organizing body, FIFA,
said last year that Brazil’s World Cup organizers needed a
“kick up the ass” in their preparations. Following initial
construction delays, all the stadiums are now set to be
inaugurated on time for the World Cup’s start in June next year,
Rebelo said. The construction companies are experienced and
using the most advanced technology, he said.  “That gives us a certain calm,” he said.  While Brazil’s national team is at a disadvantage because,
as the host of the event, it does not participate in qualifying
games and only plays friendlies, the country still boasts the
best players in the world, Rebelo said.  “We now have the challenge to forge the team for 2014,”
Rebelo said. “I think Felipao will coordinate a competitive
team.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
