NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , the seller of
Nextel mobile-phone service in  Latin America , fell to the lowest
in almost a decade after a fourth-quarter loss that included a
writedown of its assets in Chile.  The net loss of $593 million, or $3.45 a share, included a
$299 million charge for reducing the value of those assets, the
Reston, Virginia-based company said in a statement today. A year
earlier, NII reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.2 million,
or 2 cents.  NII is considering the sale of its units in Chile, Peru and
Argentina, as well as its wireless towers in  Brazil  and Mexico,
as the company struggles against larger competitors such as
 America Movil SAB (AMXL)  and Telefonica SA. NII said new networks using
third-generation, or 3G, technology should help it hold on to
more subscribers.  “Our financial results for the year did not meet
expectations,” Chairman Steven Shindler, who replaced Chief
Executive Officer Steven Dussek in December on an interim basis,
said in the statement. “In 2013, we intend to improve on our
execution.”  The shares  fell  11 percent to $4.82 at the close in  New
York , the lowest since May 2, 2003. NII has declined 32 percent
this year as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has increased
6.2 percent.  NII’s sales slid 8.4 percent to $1.47 billion, in line with
the company’s Feb. 5 preliminary figure of about $1.5 billion.
The company added about 2,000  subscribers , compared with its
Feb. 5 estimate of 2,200, after a net loss of 292,000 users in
Brazil as part of a plan to cut off unprofitable customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
