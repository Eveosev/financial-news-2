The total value of  Romania ’s green
certificates is “too big” at about 500 million euros this year
and cannot be supported by households and industrial users,
according to Constantin Nita, the Romanian Minister Delegate for
Energy.  Nita said the minimum value of one green certificate in
Romania will remain unchanged at 27 euros, as the country seeks
to change the renewables incentives scheme.  “The other values may vary,” Nita said. He declined to
comment on the maximum value of the green certificates.  Romania will finish the construction of its natural gas
pipelines linking the country with its neighbors Bulgaria,
Moldova and  Hungary  by 2014, Nita said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
