Europe will probably miss a target
for installing offshore wind power capacity because of a gap in
funding, according to researcher  Boston Consulting Group .  Developers may not get the 110 billion euros ($144 billion)
needed to meet a European Wind Energy Association projection of
raising capacity to 40 gigawatts by the end of the decade from
about 4.9 gigawatts now, BCG said today, citing a new study.  “Because of the financing difficulties, a slower
development of the market and thus an expansion of installed
capacity to 25 gigawatts by 2020 seems likely,” BCG said in a
statement. “The financing challenge will take time to resolve
because capital for a new and risk-laden industry is not readily
available, especially in the current macroeconomic climate.”  EON SE,  RWE AG (RWE)  and Dong Energy A/S are among developers of
offshore projects in U.K. and German waters as the nations seek
to cut  carbon emissions  by using more renewable energy.  Germany ,
set to shut its nuclear reactors by 2022, wants 25 gigawatts of
offshore wind by 2030, up from about 280 megawatts now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
