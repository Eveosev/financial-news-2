South African corn futures rose to
the highest level in more than two months because of
insufficient rains in the main growing parts of the country.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
gained 0.1 percent to 2,110 rand ($236) a metric ton, the
highest since Dec. 19, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange. The yellow variety declined 0.1 percent to 2,084 rand
a ton.  Bothaville in the Free State, where 40 percent of the grain
is grown, hasn’t had good rains since last week. While Showers
are predicted for that area today and tomorrow, nothing is
estimated for March 2 and March 3, according to the  South
African Weather Service ’s website.  “The weather patterns are uncertain,” Andrew Fletcher, an
independent trader, said by phone from Kroonstad in the Free
State. “Rain is not coming and with this heat, crops are
already drying up and dying and yields are severely
compromised.”  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of corn,
also known as maize. Meal made from white corn is one of the
country’s staple food and the yellow variety is mainly used as
animal feed.  Wheat for May delivery increased 0.8 percent to 3,425 rand
a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
