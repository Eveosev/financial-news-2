The Senate blocked a Republican
proposal to give President  Barack Obama  more flexibility in
implementing $85 billion in federal spending cuts set to begin
tomorrow.  By a vote of 38-62, with 60 required, senators turned back
the measure.  The Republican plan would have retained the spending cuts
for the next seven months while requiring Obama to submit a plan
by March 15 for allocating them. It would have let Congress vote
to reject the president’s plan and keep the original, across-
the-board cuts in place.  The measure, which the Obama administration said it
“strongly opposes” because it would protect “tax loopholes for
the wealthy,” is S.16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
