China’s stocks rose, driving the
biggest gains for the benchmark index in a month, on economic
growth optimism and as property developers rallied after  China
Vanke Co. (000002) ’s profit beat analyst estimates.  Vanke advanced 6 percent after the biggest Chinese
developer said net income climbed 30 percent last year.  Sany
Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  and Anhui Conch Cement Co. led industrial
companies to the second-biggest gain among 10 groups in the  CSI
300 Index (SHSZ300) , before the release of a manufacturing report
tomorrow. Ping An Bank Co. jumped 9.4 percent, extending gains
this week to 20 percent on the prospect of higher earnings.  “The foundation for the stocks rally, namely the economic
recovery, is still there as people spend more on housing and
cars to improve their lives,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at
Hengsheng Hongding Asset Management Co. in Shanghai, which
manages $190 million. “We’ll have some corrections along the
way given the index has had a very decent rally.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  rose 2.3 percent to 2,365.59
at the close, the biggest advance since Jan. 28. It pared this
month’s losses to 0.8 percent, the first monthly drop since
November. The index has gained 21 percent since a bull-market
rally started on Dec. 3. Thirty-day  volatility  was at 20.19
today, the highest in a month. The measure  trades  for 9.8 times
projected 12-month earnings, near the lowest since Dec. 24.  The CSI 300 Index gained 3 percent to 2,673.33, while the
 Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  advanced 2.4 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  added 0.8 percent in  New York 
yesterday, as U.S. housing data sent the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  to the highest level in five years.  Manufacturing Report  The National Bureau of Statistics and  China  Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing are scheduled to release a
manufacturing index for this month tomorrow. The  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index may climb to 50.5 from 50.4 a month earlier,
according to the median estimate of 30 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The number of 50 divides expansion and contraction.
HSBC Holdings Plc’s PMI index is also due tomorrow.  HSBC released a preliminary reading of its PMI index on
Feb. 25 that trailed economists’ estimates. Bank of America
Corp.’s China economist Ting Lu said the manufacturing data was
“heavily distorted” by the Chinese Lunar holiday this month.  A gauge of developers surged for a second day, gaining 3.5
percent. Vanke jumped 6 percent to 12  yuan  after reporting net
income climbed to 12.55 billion yuan ($2 billion) last year.
That compares with the 11.95 billion yuan average profit
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Biggest rival
Poly Real Estate Group Co. rose 3.6 percent to 12.82 yuan.  “We’re going to see earnings grow again after 18 to 24
months of flat earnings, which helps create tailwinds for
Chinese stocks,” Eric Brock, who helps manage $3.8 billion as a
portfolio manager at Clough Capital Partners, said by phone
yesterday from Boston.  Bank Profits  Ping An Bank jumped 9.4 percent to 23 yuan, the highest
close since April 6, 2010. It’s scheduled to release earnings on
March 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The lender
will probably report full-year net income of 13.87 billion yuan
($2.2 billion), according to 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank reported profit of 10.28 billion yuan in
2011, when it was named  Shenzhen Development Bank Co. (000001)  China
Minsheng Banking Corp. advanced 5.4 percent to 10.36 yuan.  China will keep property curbs for a long time, Vanke’s
President Yu Liang said yesterday. Chinese stocks have fallen
this month on concern the government will announce more property
restrictions to curb gains in housing prices and after the
central bank took steps to reduce market liquidity.  Sany Heavy, the biggest maker of construction equipment,
advanced for a second day, gaining 4.5 percent to 11.79 yuan.
Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement maker, jumped 6.3 percent to
19.39 yuan.  Supporting Growth  The rally for China’s stocks since the end of last year
hasn’t concluded because the economy will continue to recover
and the government may introduce more projects to support
growth, David Lai, portfolio manager at the Hong Kong unit of
China Asset Management, said in a phone interview on Feb. 25.  China will open its annual National People’s Congress on
March 5 to set this year’s growth target and discuss economic
policies. The congress will also elect new government leaders.  Almost half of China’s provinces are setting their growth
sights lower in the wake of the central government’s emphasis on
the quality of expansion over speed, a sign of an increased
focus on tackling rising debt. Fourteen provinces have set lower
targets for gross domestic product expansion this year than in
2012 and the other 17 left their goals unchanged, according to
