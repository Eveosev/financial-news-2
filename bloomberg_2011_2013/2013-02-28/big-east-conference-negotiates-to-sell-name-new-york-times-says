The  Big East  conference, which will
be left with one of its founding schools by 2014, is negotiating
the sale of its name to a new group of seven Catholic
universities, the New York Times reported.  The schools -- St. John’s,  Seton Hall , Marquette, DePaul,
Georgetown, Villanova and Providence -- are starting their own
basketball conference.  The price will be based on pools of revenue that include
exit fees from departing universities, entry fees for new
members and cash earned for games played in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association men’s basketball tournament, the
newspaper said. From 2006 to 2011, the conference amassed $17.7
million from those units, the Times said, citing the NCAA.  The Big East lacks the geographic boundaries it originally
had as Central Florida, Houston, Memphis, Southern Methodist,
Tulane, Eastern Carolina and Navy join Connecticut, Cincinnati,
Temple and  South Florida . The conference is seeking to add a
12th member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
