Leveraged buyouts may be as
compelling as ever because borrowing costs are so low for less-
creditworthy companies, according to Stephen Antczak, Citigroup
Inc.’s head of U.S. credit strategy.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks a Citigroup index of the
average bond yield for companies with B ratings, which Antczak
cited in a report as a typical post-buyout level. The gauge is
compiled monthly.  January’s average yield of 5.86 percent was the lowest
since at least 1984, according to the index. Data compiled by
Bloomberg shows the yields on benchmark maturities of B rated
debt are near lows set last month.  Financing costs are part of a “package effect” working in
favor of buyouts, which reward shareholders at the expense of
bondholders, Antczak wrote in a Feb. 22 report.  Lower interest expense increases the odds that a company
will survive and keep paying dividends after a buyout, the New
York-based strategist wrote. The report cited Citigroup figures
that put the risk of default within a year for B rated companies
at 1.6 percent, below a 4.4 percent average since 2000.  “One doesn’t have to pay all that much for these
advantages,” Antczak wrote, judging by price-earnings ratios.
Shares of 90 non-financial U.S. companies with investment-grade
ratings traded at 12.8 times profit as a group as of Sept. 30,
according to the report. The multiple was below an average of
16.4 times since 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
