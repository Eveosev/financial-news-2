Oakland,  California , is appealing
the dismissal of its lawsuit against the Obama administration
over its right to permit medical marijuana clubs while asking a
judge to halt forfeiture proceedings against a local dispensary.  The city filed a notice yesterday that it will seek review
of the case by the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San Francisco. U.S.
Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James ruled Feb. 14 that she
doesn’t have jurisdiction over Oakland’s lawsuit challenging
federal actions against Harborside Health Center, which sells 70
types of marijuana, makes $20 million a year and offers home
delivery.  Oakland sued the federal government after U.S. prosecutors
filed a forfeiture case to seize property housing Harborside.
Prosecutors called the center a “superstore” serving 100,000
customers in violation of federal drug laws.  The case is City of Oakland v. Holder, 12-05245, U.S.
district Court, Northern District of California ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
