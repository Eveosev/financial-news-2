Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained more
than other  Gulf of Mexico  crudes on the  spot market  as benchmark
West Texas Intermediate’s discount to  Brent crude  widened.  WTI weakened 33 cents to $19.44 a barrel at 1:57 p.m. in
New York. When Brent gains versus WTI, it typically strengthens
the value of U.S. grades that compete with foreign oils priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 40 cents a
barrel to $21.25 at 2:14 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 15 cents a
barrel to trade at $20.55 over WTI.  Mars Blend’s premium to WTI rose by 30 cents to $16.50 a
barrel, while Poseidon’s premium gained 15 cents to $16.75 a
barrel over WTI. The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a

narrowed by 15 cents to $18.85.  The discount for Western Canada Select against WTI narrowed
50 cents to $25.50 a barrel, and Syncrude’s premium was
