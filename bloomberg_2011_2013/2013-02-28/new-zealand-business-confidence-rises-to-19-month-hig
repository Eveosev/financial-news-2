New Zealand  business confidence rose
to a 19-month high as record-low  interest rates , rising property
prices, and an improving global outlook add to signs of an
accelerating economic recovery.  A net 39.4 percent of companies expect the economy will
improve over the next 12 months, the highest since July 2011,
ANZ Bank New Zealand Ltd. said in a statement released in
Wellington today. The net figure subtracts pessimists from
optimists.  “Businesses have more of a spring in their step,” ANZ
Chief Economist  Cameron Bagrie  said in the statement. “We’ve
seen a modest lift in  consumer confidence  as well. That ‘‘gives
credence to the argument that rises in business sentiment may be
more substance than noise this time around.’’  New Zealand’s currency rose as investors increase bets that
faster economic growth may fan inflation and prompt central bank
Governor Graeme Wheeler to raise interest rates this year. ANZ’s
composite indicator is pointing to 2.8 percent growth by mid
2013, Bagrie said.  The currency rose to 82.78 U.S. cents at 1:26 p.m. in
Wellington from 82.61 cents immediately before the report.  Nine of 16 economists surveyed last week by  Bloomberg News 
forecast Wheeler will keep the official cash rate at a record-
low 2.5 percent until next year.  The survey of 445 companies showed that 37.6 percent of
firms expect their own sales and profits will improve, up from
31.4 percent in December. The survey isn’t conducted in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
