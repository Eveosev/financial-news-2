The grand jury that investigated
Jerry Sandusky, the former  Pennsylvania  State University
assistant football coach found guilty of sexually abusing boys,
will be probed by a special prosecutor over possible leaks.  State Judge Barry Feudale appointed James M. Reeder to look
into allegations that statewide and county grand jury secrecy
may have been compromised, according to a Feb. 8 order obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  It’s unclear from the order whether the investigation will
focus on the Sandusky case. The order governs the 33rd Statewide
Investigating Grand Jury, the panel that handled the Sandusky
case, as well as the 36th statewide grand jury and a county
level grand jury, according to the filing.  Sandusky, 69, was found guilty in June of 45 counts of
abusing boys over a 15-year period. He was sentenced to at least
30 years in prison and is serving time in a maximum-security
facility in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania.  A grand jury report, released the day Sandusky was charged
in November 2011, detailed the case against him by chronicling
the abuse of boys at various locations including Sandusky’s home
and buildings on  Penn State ’s campus. The report also implicated
two former Penn State officials who were charged in a related
case with perjury and endangering the welfare of a child.  To contact the reporter on this story:
