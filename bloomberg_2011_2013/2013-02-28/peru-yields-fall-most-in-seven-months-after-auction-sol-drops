Peru’s bonds rose, pushing yields
down the most in seven months, on demand from local investors
who didn’t participate in the government’s biggest issuance of
local debt since 2010.  The yield on the 5.2 percent sol-denominated bond due in
September 2023 fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point,
to 4.18 percent at 3:08 p.m. in  Lima , the steepest decline since
July 13, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
climbed 1.13 centimos to 108.44 centimos per sol.  Some investors decided to buy the notes today after
abstaining from yesterday’s auction because they thought yields
being offered were too low, said Walther Benavides, a trader at
 BBVA Banco Continental  in Lima.  “They don’t want to be left out of a possible rally,”
Benavides said in an e-mailed response to questions. “No one
expects higher rates this year. GDP and inflation are slowing.
Stimulus in the U.S. and the euro zone will continue for a
considerable amount of time. That means low rates for  Latin
America  as well.”  Peru issued 1.9 billion soles ($734 million) of sol-
denominated bonds yesterday to finance the prepayment of bank
loans. Bonds maturing in 2023 were issued at a yield of 4.2
percent while the securities maturing in February 2042 were sold
to yield 5.14 percent, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The 1.18 billion soles of bonds due in 2023 issued
yesterday may attract foreign investors seeking local-currency
bonds that are being actively traded in the secondary market,
according to Diego Llona, a trader at Banco Santander Peru SA.  Before yesterday, the government had issued 887 million
soles of the bonds maturing in 2023, the smallest outstanding
debt after its September 2013 bond.  Prepaid Loans  Peru will prepay $1.7 billion of loans from the Inter-
American Development Bank and  World Bank  to reduce its dollar
debt, the ministry said Feb. 26. The operations are part of a
plan to remove $4 billion of U.S. currency from the foreign-
exchange market to slow sol appreciation, Finance Minister
Miguel Castilla said Feb. 18.  The sol fell 0.3 percent to 2.5888 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, extending its drop in February to 0.5 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency weakened
after the central bank raised lenders’ dollar reserve
requirements yesterday for the third time this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
