Royal Bank of Canada ,  Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce  and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  reported
first-quarter profits that topped analysts’ estimates on record
earnings from personal and commercial lending.  Royal Bank, Canada’s largest lender by assets, said net
income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose 12 percent to C$2.07
billion ($2.02 billion), or C$1.36 a share. CIBC, the fifth-
biggest bank, said profit fell 4.4 percent to C$798 million,
while Toronto-Dominion, the No. 2 bank, said profit climbed 21
percent to C$1.79 billion, or $1.86 a share.  The three Toronto-based lenders posted record profits from
consumer and business lending, defying an expected slowdown
after  household debt  rose to a record. The banks benefited from
rising demand for corporate loans, credit cards and personal
financial services.  A Canadian residential mortgage lending slowdown is
“pretty much to be expected when you consider that consumers
are starting to deleverage,” Toronto-Dominion Chief Financial
Officer Colleen Johnston said today in a telephone interview.
“An area of huge growth for us, though, has been on the
business banking side. That’s an area where we’ve really taken a
lot of market share.”  Royal Bank shares rose less than 1 percent to C$64.02 at 4
p.m. in Toronto. Toronto-Dominion gained 0.7 percent to C$84.85,
while CIBC fell 0.9 percent to C$83.14.  ‘Solid Quarter’  Royal Bank said profit at its personal and business banking
unit, which includes Caribbean banking, rose 11 percent to
C$1.12 billion. CIBC’s retail and business banking business had
profit of C$611 million, a 7.8 percent increase, the firm said.
Toronto-Dominion said adjusted earnings from consumer and
commercial banking rose 11 percent to C$944 million.  “CIBC reported a solid quarter, with surprisingly stronger
retail banking earnings than anticipated,”  John Aiken , an
analyst at Barclays Plc, said today in a note.  Royal Bank said it set aside C$349 million for bad loans,
up 31 percent from a year ago. Provisions in Canadian banking
fell 12 percent to C$213 million. Canadian Imperial set aside
C$265 million for bad loans, down 22 percent from a year ago.  Royal Bank and Toronto-Dominion raised their  dividends ,
while CIBC’s was  unchanged .  Royal Bank’s profit excluding some items was C$1.38 a
share, beating the C$1.32 a share average  estimate  of 16
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Revenue rose 4.4 percent to
C$7.91 billion  from C$7.57 billion.  Credit Cards  Profit at  RBC Capital Markets  rose 25 percent to C$464
million on higher fees from advising on North American takeovers
and an increase in U.S. lending and loan syndication. Wealth
management earnings rose 23 percent to a record C$233 million,
while insurance fell 14 percent to C$164 million, the bank said.  Royal Bank’s revenue from Canadian personal financial
services grew 6.9 percent to C$1.68 billion in the quarter from
a year ago and business financial services rose 2.4 percent to
C$738 million. Credit cards and payments rose 5.3 percent to
C$620 million. Revenue from Caribbean and U.S. banking was
little changed at C$204 million.  CIBC’s earnings were eroded by a settlement with the Lehman
Brothers Holding Inc.’s estate to end a two-year-old legal
dispute over collateralized debt obligation deals. The lender
said Dec. 31 that the after-tax cost of the settlement is $110
million. Excluding the cost and other items, CIBC said it earned
C$2.15 a share, beating the C$2.09 a share average estimate of
16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 0.8 percent to
C$3.18 billion.  CIBC-Aeroplan  CIBC’s wealth-management profit was C$90 million, down 10
percent. The lender’s investment-banking business earned C$91
million, down 32 percent from a year earlier.  CIBC also said today in its statement that its Aeroplan
credit-card partnership with  Aimia Inc. (AIM)  will expire Dec. 31
unless both companies agree to extend.  “CIBC has engaged in periodic extension discussions with
Aimia, but is also exploring alternatives to extending the
Aeroplan agreement,” the bank said.  Toronto-Dominion’s Johnston said today the bank will
probably raise its dividend again this year. The bank topped
expectations largely because of lower-than-expected provisions
for credit losses, said Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst at RBC
Capital Markets.  “While expenses came in higher than we had forecast,
provisions for credit losses came in lower than our forecast,”
Hardy said today in a note to clients.  Toronto-Dominion  The lender’s domestic consumer banking climbed 11 percent
to C$944 million as wealth and insurance earnings increased 8
percent to C$377 million.  U.S. consumer banking earnings climbed 9.4 percent to C$385
million, Toronto-Dominion said. The bank has spent more than $25
billion on U.S. acquisitions since 2004, building a network of
branches that spans from  Maine  to  Florida . Wholesale profit
declined 18 percent to C$159 million.  Toronto-Dominion CEO  Edmund Clark  also denied reports that
the bank was interested in acquiring a stake of Citizens
Financial Group Inc. from Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. Such
a transaction wouldn’t “fit the bank’s strategy, timing and
risk appetite,” Clark told investors today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
