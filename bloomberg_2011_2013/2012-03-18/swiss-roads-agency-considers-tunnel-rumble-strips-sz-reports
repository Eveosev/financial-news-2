Switzerland â€™s Federal Roads Agency
is considering installing so-called rumble strips in tunnels
after the March 13 bus crash in which 28 people died,
SonntagsZeitung  reported , citing Juerg Roethlisberger, an agency
official.  In  Germany , accidents in which vehicles veer off the side
of the road have declined 43 percent since rumble strips were
installed, the newspaper said. The strips warn drivers when
their vehicles stray too close to the side of the road.  To contact the reporter on this story:
