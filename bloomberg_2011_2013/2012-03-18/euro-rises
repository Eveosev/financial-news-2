The yen reversed daily losses
against the euro and dollar on speculation its recent declines
were excessive and as Asian stocks pared gains.  The euro touched a 4 1/2-month high against the yen after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said European officials have
discussed combining the euro-area’s bailout funds to reinforce
the region’s financial firewall. Demand for the 17-nation euro
was also supported before Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
holds talks with unions and employers to revise  labor laws .  The yen gained 0.5 percent to 109.37 per euro as of 7:55
a.m. in  London  after earlier sliding to 110.15 yen, the weakest
since Oct. 31. Japan’s currency gained 0.4 percent to 83.08 per
dollar. The common currency bought $1.3161 from $1.3175 on March
16.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose as much as 0.4
percent before trimming gains to 0.2 percent.  The yen has declined 1.5 percent in the past week, the
worst performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
lost 0.3 percent, while the euro slid 0.2 percent in the same
period.  The greenback’s 14-day relative strength index against the
yen was at 69.9 today, near the 70 level some traders see as a
sign an asset may reverse direction. The euro’s RSI versus the
yen was at 67.  European finance ministers have discussed “combination
possibilities” for the permanent and temporary rescue funds
ahead of a March 30 meeting in Copenhagen, Merkel said on March
16. Ministers may decide to increase the region’s crisis fund to
a total capacity of 692 billion euros ($911 billion) when they
meet, a euro-area official said separately.  An easing of  Europe ’s debt crisis has offered breathing
room for Italy’s Monti to seek a labor-market overhaul. The
Italian premier’s planned changes include a revision of firing
rules and an expansion of jobless benefits.  The Australian dollar rose against the greenback after
Reserve Bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  expressed confidence in
 China , the South Pacific nation’s largest trading partner.
“China will have cycles like other economies, but it seems
likely that the Chinese economy will grow pretty strongly on
average for a while yet,” Stevens said, according to the text
of a speech delivered in Hong Kong today.  The so-called Aussie climbed 0.2 percent to $1.0607.  To contact the reporter on this story:
