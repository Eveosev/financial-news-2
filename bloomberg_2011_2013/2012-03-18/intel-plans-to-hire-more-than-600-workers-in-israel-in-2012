Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s biggest
maker of semiconductors, plans to hire more than 600 workers
this year for its research and development and manufacturing
centers in Israel.  Intel employed 7,782 people in the country at the end of
2011, and exported $2.2 billion of goods from Israel last year,
Maxine Fassberg, Intel Israel’s general manager, said today at a
news conference in  Tel Aviv . This compares with exports of $2.7
billion in 2010.  Exports fell because a $3 billion upgrade at the company’s
plant in Kiryat Gat caused a drop in production, Fassberg said.
Intel, based in  Santa Clara ,  California , revamped the plant to
enable it to produce 22-nanometer technology for chips. The
company plans to start production of the new chips this year,
said Shmuel (Mooly) Eden, the new president of Intel Israel.  “The fact that they have decided to have both a president
and a chief executive officer locally is a sign of recognition
of the importance of Israel in Intel’s operations,” Eden said.  Since 1998 Intel has invested in 64 Israeli companies,
ranking Israel behind only the U.S., India and  China  among
countries with the most investment from Intel, he said.  “We will continue to invest in acquisitions in Israeli
startups” Eden said.  Fassberg said Intel has made no decision about setting up
an additional factory in Israel.  Intel has invested $9.4 billion in Israel since 1996, most
of it in production facilities, and has received government
grants totaling $1.3 billion, according to the chipmaker.  Intel employed about 100,100 people worldwide as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
