Mexico will keep its oil industry
state-owned as government-held oil company  Petroleos Mexicanos 
successfully stemmed output declines in aging fields, Mexican
President Felipe Calderon said.  Pemex will invest about 300 billion pesos ($23.7 billion)
this year and has stemmed declines at its flagship Cantarell
field, Calderon told workers in Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, during a
ceremony to commemorate the 74th anniversary of the nation’s
expropriation of foreign oil assets.  Crude output will rise for the first time since 2004 and
may return to historical levels of 3 million barrels a day,
Pemex Chief Executive Officer  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said.  “I’m very proud that Pemex has retaken the route to once
again become a world-class company,” Calderon said. “Oil will
continue to be, exclusively for, the Mexican people.”  Pemex, the world’s third-largest oil producer, expects
output from its aging Cantarell field to gain this year,
allowing the state-owned company to boost production for the
first time in eight years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
