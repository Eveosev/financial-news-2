Mexican Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said policy makers should avoid unilateral
devaluations to boost economic competitiveness, website  Emerging
Markets  reported.  Meade, who is serving as head of the Group of 20 nations,
said relying on short-term devaluations will do less to help
countries boost growth in the aftermath of the European debt
crisis than policies to increase domestic demand, consumption
and investment,  Emerging Markets  said.  A meeting of G-20 representatives in Los Cabos, Mexico, in
June will focus partly on currency imbalances, Meade said in an
interview with the website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
