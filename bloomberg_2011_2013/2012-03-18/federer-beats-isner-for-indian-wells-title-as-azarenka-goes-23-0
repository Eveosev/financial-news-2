Roger Federer  took his record-tying
19th Masters tennis title by beating  John Isner  in the BNP
Paribas Open final in  Indian Wells ,  California .  Federer, the No. 3 seed from Switzerland, defeated No. 11
Isner 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 yesterday to avenge a loss to the American
in the Davis Cup last month. Federer has won 39 of his past 41
matches since a loss in the U.S. Open semifinals.  Federer, who received $1 million for winning a record
fourth title at Indian Wells Tennis Garden, has won three
straight tournaments in a  15-0 run  since losing to Isner.
Federer also won in Indian Wells from 2004-06 and his latest
success puts him level with  Rafael Nadal  on 19 Masters 1000
titles, the tier below the four Grand Slams.  “It’s been a long time since I have been this successful
here,” Federer, 30, told reporters. “It’s nice taking it all
the way and getting victories.”  The 6-foot-9 Isner, 26, had reached the final with his
first career victory over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the
semifinals. Federer knocked off second-seeded Nadal in the semis
to improve to 10-18 in career meetings against the Spaniard,
whom he lost to in January’s Australian Open semifinals.  Victoria Azarenka won the women’s title yesterday, lifting
her record this year to 23-0 with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over  Maria Sharapova  in a rematch of the women’s final at Melbourne Park.  The top-ranked Belarusian received $1 million and is 5-3
all-time against  Russia ’s Sharapova. Azarenka’s start is the
best in women’s tennis since Martina Hingis opened the 1997
season on a 37-0 run. Azarenka has won all four tournaments
she’s played this year, with titles in Sydney and Doha along
with the Australian Open and Indian Wells victories  “Last year was a learning experience for me,” Azarenka
said after beating Sharapova. “I had a lot of tough losses last
year and so now I’m really trying to turn it around in my own
favor. I never dreamed this would happen.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
