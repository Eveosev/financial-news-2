Sweden may not cut income taxes a
fifth time before 2014 parliamentary elections, Finance Minister
Anders Borg was cited as saying by Tidningarnas Telegrambyraa.  There won’t be further reductions next year, after four
cuts since the government took power in 2006, and it’s unclear
whether there will be any in 2014, it cited Borg as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
