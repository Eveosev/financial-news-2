BC Partners  Ltd. re-acquired a
majority stake in real estate agent Foxtons Ltd. for between 55
million pounds ($87 million) and 75 million pounds, the  Sunday
Telegraph reported , without saying where it got the information.  BC Partners had ceded control of Foxtons in 2010 after
creditors reorganized the real estate company’s debt.  The transaction will result in a “paper profit” for Bank
of America Corp. and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , who exchanged
280 million pounds of debt for a 52 percent stake during
Foxtons’ restructuring, according to the newspaper.  Ed Orlebar, a spokesman in London for BC Partners, declined
to comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
