George Osborne will provide 40 billion pounds ($63.4 billion) in
low-rate loans to small businesses, the  Sunday Times reported ,
without saying where it got the information.  The plan, to be announced this week, will apply to firms
with revenues of as much as 50 million pounds and use money
diverted from the Bank of Englandâ€™s quantitative easing
facility, according to the newspaper.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ,
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)  have agreed to participate, the Sunday Times
