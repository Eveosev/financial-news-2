A soldier threatened to blow
up a barracks at Joint Base Lewis-McChord yesterday,
according to Lieutenant Colonel Gary Dangerfield, a
spokesman for the installation in Washington state.  Military police took the suspect, whose name wasnâ€™t
disclosed, into custody and are investigating the case,
Dangerfield said in a phone interview today. No individual
or structure was damaged, he said.  Lewis-McChord is the home base of Robert Bales, the
soldier being held in a military prison in  Kansas  in the
killings of at least 16 civilians in  Afghanistan  on March
11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
