Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will use assets in the transfer of  Royal Mail  Group
Ltd.’s pension fund to the government’s balance sheet to reduce
debt, said a person with knowledge of the matter.  The government will gain 28 billion pounds ($44.3 billion)
of assets from April, subject to approval of European Union
regulators, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the plans aren’t yet public. Contingent liabilities
worth 37.5 billion pounds will appear on the government’s
balance sheet as they become due over the next two decades.  The plans, to be announced by Osborne in the March 21
Budget, leave the government responsible for Royal Mail’s 8.4
billion-pound pension shortfall, ahead of a sale of the state-
owned postal service. U.K. public sector net debt will be 1.2
trillion pounds in the year through March 2013.  EU regulators can block payments that would give one
company an unfair advantage over rivals. The EU is also
investigating German subsidies for  Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  and Belgian
aid to  La Poste .  To contact the reporter on this story:
