The San Francisco 49ers signed
free-agent wide receiver Mario Manningham five days after  Randy Moss  ended his retirement to join the team,  NFL.com said , citing
an unidentified National Football League source.  Bob Lange, a spokesman for the 49ers, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking confirmation.  The 25-year-old Manningham hauled in a 38-yard catch along
the sideline amid double coverage to spark the winning drive in
the  New York Giants ’ Feb. 5 Super Bowl win over the  New England
Patriots .  Manningham was limited to 12 regular-season appearances
last season. He had 39 catches for 523 yards and four
touchdowns, his worst performances on those measures since his
NFL debut season four years ago. He had 13 receptions for 189
yards and three touchdowns in four playoff games.  Moss ended his seven-month retirement by joining the 49ers
on a one-year contract, the team said March 12.  The 49ers reached the playoffs last season for the first
time since the 2002 season in Jim Harbaugh’s first campaign as
coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
