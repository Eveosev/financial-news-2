Egypt  plans to raise 3.5 billion
pounds ($581 million) from the sale of treasury bills amid
falling yields as the country nears an agreement to clinch a
$3.2 billion loan from the  International Monetary Fund .  The  Finance Ministry  seeks to sell 3.5 billion pounds in
nine-month notes today and 1 billion pounds in seven-year bonds
tomorrow, central bank data on Bloomberg show. The average yield
on six-month notes declined five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 14.82 percent at a sale on March 15, while
the yield on one-year securities fell two basis points.  A technical team from the International Monetary Fund is
due today in Cairo to hold talks with Egyptian officials about
the loan, Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed said March 13.
Economists such as Raza Agha of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc have said the loan may encourage donor countries to increase
their support of Egypt, which lost more than 50 percent of its
international foreign reserves after last year’s revolt that
ousted President  Hosni Mubarak .  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April
2020 tumbled 23 basis points last week to 6.45 percent on March
16, the lowest since Nov. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pound, subject to a managed float, strengthened
0.1 percent to 6.0285 a dollar on March 16, the highest level on
a closing basis since Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
