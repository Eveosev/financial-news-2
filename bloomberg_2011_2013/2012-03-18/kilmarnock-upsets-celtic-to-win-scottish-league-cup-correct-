(Corrects location of match in second paragraph.)  Kilmarnock upset Celtic 1-0 today
in the final of Scottish soccer’s League Cup to win the
competition for a first time.  Dieter Van Tornhout got the only goal at Glasgow’s Hampden
Park after 84 minutes to hand Celtic a defeat in the final for a
second straight season.  It is Kilmarnock’s first trophy since winning the Scottish
Cup in 1997. Killie had suffered five defeats in the League Cup
final, with its last appearance in 2007.  The loss denies Celtic the opportunity of claiming a treble
of trophies this season. It leads the Premier League and is in
the semifinals of the Scottish Cup.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
