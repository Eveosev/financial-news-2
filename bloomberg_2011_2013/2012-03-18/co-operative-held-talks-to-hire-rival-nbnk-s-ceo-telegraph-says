the lender to acquire 630 branches from  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) , the  Sunday Telegraph  said, citing unidentified people close
to Co-Op.  The talks with NBNK Chief Executive Officer Gary Hoffman
were held in the past six weeks before breaking down, the

executive for the Co-Operative Bank, with a strong list of
candidates,” Co-Op spokesman Russell Brady said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
