International Monetary Fund
Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  said  China ’s efforts to
reduce its dependence on exports and investment for economic
growth should incorporate financial reforms that include a
stronger and more flexible exchange rate.  In addition to China’s currency, the “core elements” of
that financial reform should also include more effective
liquidity and monetary management, high quality supervision and
regulation, well-developed financial markets and products,
flexible deposit and lending rates and an opening up of the
capital account, according to a transcript of a speech Lagarde
is to give at the China Development Forum in Beijing today.  Lagarde also named boosting household incomes and making
the benefits of growth more “inclusive” and addressing China’s
aging population as priorities for transforming the country’s
economic growth model.  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
