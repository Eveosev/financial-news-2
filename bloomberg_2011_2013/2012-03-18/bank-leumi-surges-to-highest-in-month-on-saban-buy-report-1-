Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  rose to
the highest in almost a month after a local website reported
investor  Haim Saban  and outgoing Leumi Chief Executive Officer
Galia Maor may acquire a stake in the bank. The bank denied the
report after the close of trading today.  The  shares  of Leumi, the country’s largest bank by assets,
 climbed  1.8 percent to 11.65 shekels, the highest since Feb. 23,
at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  “The shares are rising on the rumor that Saban might want
to buy a stake in Leumi,” said Terence Klingman, senior analyst
for international clients at Psagot Investment House Ltd. “I
would not attach high value to the rumor.”  Israel ’s  News1 hebrew website  reported Haim Saban, the
chairman and chief executive officer of Saban Capital Group,
together with investors may consider buying the 9.6 percent
stake in Leumi that may be sold by businessman Shlomo Eliahu,
after his acquisition of  Migdal Insurance and Financial Holding
Ltd.  earlier this month.  At the time of the Migdal accord, Eliahu said he would need
to reach an agreement with regulators about his stake in the
bank.  “There is nothing to it,” Leumi said in an e-mailed
statement after the close of trading today. Moshe Debby, a
spokesman for Saban Capital Group in Israel, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
