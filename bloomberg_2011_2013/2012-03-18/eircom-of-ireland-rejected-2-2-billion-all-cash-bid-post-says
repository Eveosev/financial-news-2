Eircom Group Ltd (ERU) . rejected a 1.7-
billion euro ($2.2 billion) all-cash offer on March 14 because
it undervalued the company, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  The bid was the only rival to an offer by Eircom’s first-
lien lenders to write-off 15 percent of their 2.8 billion euros
of loans in return for taking over the company, the newspaper
said, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  informed Eircom’s board of the offer from a
company with “considerable European” telecommunications
experience, the Dublin-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
