U.K. companies have grown more
concerned that a 50 percent top rate of income tax is impeding
their growth, the  Sunday Telegraph reported , citing a survey by
Ernst & Young LLP.  Twenty-seven percent of firms questioned by Ernst & Young
said the tax level is hindering their expansion in the U.K., up
from 9 percent last year, according to the newspaper. The data
may increase pressure on Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  to proceed with a reduction of the tax to 40 percent,
the Telegraph said. More than 60 businesses, 40 percent of which
had sales of more than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), were
questioned for the survey, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
