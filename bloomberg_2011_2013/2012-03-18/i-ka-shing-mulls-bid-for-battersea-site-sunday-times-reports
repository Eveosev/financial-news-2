Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest
man, may bid for the Battersea power station site in London, the
Sunday Times said, without saying where it got the information.  Li’s  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. (13)  expressed “serious interest”
in the 38-acre site, which is being put up for sale with a
deadline for first-round bids in May, according to the report.  The offer for the site on the south bank of the Thames also
drew developers including  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , British
Land Co., Land Securities Group Plc, and sovereign wealth funds
from Abu Dhabi and Qatar, according to the newspaper, which said
the derelict landmark would attract bids of 250 million pounds
($396 million) to 350 million pounds.  Winnie Cheong, a spokeswoman for Cheung Kong Holdings Ltd.,
didn’t immediately return a phone message or e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
