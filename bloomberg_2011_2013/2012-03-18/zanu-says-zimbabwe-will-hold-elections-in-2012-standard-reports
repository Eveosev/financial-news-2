Zimbabwe  President  Robert Mugabe 
will call party and national elections this year, the  Standard 
said, citing Didymus Mutasa, secretary for administration in his
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party.  Zanu-PF will hold party primaries in June and a national
election later in the year, the Harare-based Standard quoted
Mutasa as saying. The party won’t wait for a new constitution to
be ratified by referendum beyond 2012, the newspaper said.  Zanu-PF shares power with Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change. Under an agreement
brokered by the Southern African Development Community in 2008,
Zimbabwe isn’t supposed to hold elections until a new
constitution has been accepted in a referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
