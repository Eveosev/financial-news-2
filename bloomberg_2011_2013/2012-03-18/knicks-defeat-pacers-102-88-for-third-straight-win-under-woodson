Jeremy Lin scored 19 points to lead
the  New York  Knicks to their third straight victory under
interim coach Mike Woodson, a 102-88 National Basketball
Association victory over the  Indiana Pacers .  “Our hearts are right and it was a total team effort,”
Woodson told reporters. “I couldn’t be more proud of the team
than I am tonight.”  Woodson took over the team when  Mike D’Antoni  resigned
March 14 after the Knicks dropped six in a row. His three wins
include back-to-back victories over the Pacers.  Carmelo Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire each scored 16 points
for the Knicks, who had a 60-51 advantage over Indiana at
halftime at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  The Pacers were led by Roy Hibbert who had 24 points and 12
rebounds and Paul George with 18 points.  “I thought our guys played with a lot more fight than they
did last night,” Pacers coach Frank Vogel said, referring to
the team’s 115-100 loss to the Knicks. “We closed the gap, but
couldn’t get over the hump.”  The Knicks (21-24) are in eighth place, the final playoff
spot, in the Eastern Conference, 15 games behind the  Chicago
Bulls . The Pacers own fifth place, 10 games back from the
leader.  Before last night’s game, Woodson added assistant coaches
Jim Todd and Darrell Walker to his staff, replacing Dan D’Antoni
and Phil Weber who left when Mike D’Antoni resigned.  Todd comes to New York from the Sacramento Kings where he
was an assistant coach this season. He was Woodson’s assistant
with the  Atlanta Hawks  from 2008-10, and coached in China from
2010-11.  Todd and Woodson both served as assistants under coach
Chris Ford in Milwaukee from 1996-98.  Walker, a former Knicks player, was an assistant coach with
the  Detroit Pistons  from 2007-10. He also worked with the  New
Orleans Hornets  and the Toronto Raptors where he was promoted to
head coach in 1996-97 and compiled a 41-90 record over two
seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
