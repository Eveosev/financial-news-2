HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  is unlikely to
take part in the U.K. government’s program to boost low-cost
lending to small businesses, the Mail on Sunday reported,
without citing where it got the information.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  is expected to sign up to the National Loan
Guarantee Scheme along with Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, according to the report. Barclays
does have “reservations” about the program, the Mail said.  The govermment’s program would not allow HSBC to lend any
cheaper than it already does and still make a profit on the
loan, the newspaper said.  Patrick Humphris, a spokesman for HSBC in London, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
