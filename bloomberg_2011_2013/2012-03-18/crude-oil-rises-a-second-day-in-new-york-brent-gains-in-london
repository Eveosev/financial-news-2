Oil traded near the highest price
in a week in  New York  as investors bet that a U.S. economic
recovery and Saudi Arabian crude output near the strongest level
since at least 1980 signal fuel demand is increasing.  Futures were little changed after climbing the most in more
than three weeks on March 16. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, pumped
9.87 million barrels a day in January, according to data
submitted to the Joint Organization Data Initiative. Reports
this week may show the economy strengthening in the U.S., the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  “We’re looking at a period of moderate growth in the U.S.,
and the outlook has picked up,” said Ric Spooner, a chief
market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney who sees West Texas
Intermediate crude trading in a range of about $104 a barrel to
$108 a barrel. “If it continues on from here up into $108 plus
in terms of the New York price, that would start to look as
though it was making a bit more of a positive statement in terms
of breaking resistance from a technical point of view.”  Oil for April delivery was at $107.01 a barrel, down 5
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 3:35 p.m. Singapore time. The contract, which expires
tomorrow, climbed 1.9 percent to $107.06 on March 16, the
highest close since March 9. The more actively traded May future
dropped 6 cents to $107.52 today. Prices are up 8.3 percent this
year.  Brent oil for May settlement was at $125.47 a barrel, down
34 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a  premium  of $17.95 to New
York futures for the same month.  Saudi Output  Saudi Arabia’s January crude output rose 0.6 percent from
December and compares with 10.05 million barrels a day in
November. The U.S. Energy Department said November’s rise was
the largest in at least 31 years.  Oil exports from  Saudi Arabia  climbed 2 percent in January
to 7.5 million barrels a day, the JODI data show. Shipments by
 Iran , OPEC’s second biggest producer, increased to 2.3 million
barrels a day, the highest since December 2008. JODI is
supervised by the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum and
compiles data provided by member governments.  Oil prices  will have a “bumpy ride in the months ahead”
because of a “slim buffer” of spare crude-production capacity,
the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly market
report on March 14. World oil supplies are “tight” with spare
capacity at about 2.5 million barrels a day compared with 3.5
million in 2008 to 2010, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman said the same day.  Home purchases in the U.S. probably rose in February to the
highest level in almost two years, a sign of stabilization in
the real-estate market, according to Bloomberg News surveys of
economists before reports this week.  Hedge funds  decreased oil wagers on rising prices by 6,188,
or 2.5 percent, to 258,406  contracts  in the seven days ended
March 13, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
