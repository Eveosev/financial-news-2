Tanzania ’s benchmark coffee grade
fell 8.6 percent at an auction Mar. 15 after the quality of the
beans declined and global prices slumped, the Tanzania Coffee
Board said.  The average price for Arabica AA declined to an average of
$213.07 per 50 kilograms (110 pounds) from $233.07 a week
earlier, the board said yesterday by e-mail from Moshi, in
northern Tanzania.  The grade sold for as much as $242.40 per 50 kilograms
compared to $255.60 the previous week, it said. The board
offered 2,827 bags and 1,411 were bought, it added.  The quality of the beans at the auction have declined as
the nation draws closer to the end of the 2011-12 season,
according to the board.  The board offered 10,813 bags of which 6,703 bags were
bought, it said in the statement. Tanzania prices its coffee per
50 kilograms while offers and sales are in 60-kilogram bags.  Tanzania reaps its crop from April through August. Arabica
accounts for 75 percent of the country’s output, while robusta
accounts for the rest.  Production for this marketing season, which started July 1
and closes June 30, may fall to 37,000 metric tons from the July
14 forecast of 45,000 tons because of bad weather, Adolph
Kumburu, the board’s director general, said on Jan. 30. The
nation produced 56,247 tons last season, he said.  The following are details of the Mar. 15 auction in U.S.
dollars for a 50-kilogram bag for the good grades:
