Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  may save 1
billion pounds ($1.6 billion) in taxes if its bid for  Cable &
Wireless  Worldwide Plc succeeds, the  Sunday Times reported ,
citing analysts it didnâ€™t identify.  Vodafone may reduce its tax bill by this amount because
Cable & Wireless has posted 5.2 billion pounds in capital
losses, the newspaper said. The savings would cover most of the
cost of the potential acquisition, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
