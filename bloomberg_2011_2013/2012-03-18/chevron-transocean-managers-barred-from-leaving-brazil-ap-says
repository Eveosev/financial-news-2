A judge in Brazil barred 17  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  and  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  executives yesterday from leaving the
country after a new leak near an offshore oil well that spilled
110,000 gallons (416,395 liters) last year, the Associated Press
reported.  The federal judge’s order names George Buck, the chief
operating officer of Chevron’s Brazilian division, and includes
16 other Chevron and Transocean officials, AP said, citing
Marcelo del Negri, a spokesman for Brazilian federal
prosecutors.  Neither Chevron Brasil nor its executives have been
formally notified of any action by the judiciary, Chevron told
Bloomberg News in an e-mailed statement. “We will defend the
company and its employees and any legal decision will be abided
by the company and its employees,” the company said in the
statement.  Guy Cantwell , a spokesman for Transocean, declined to
comment to Bloomberg when reached via telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
