A helicopter supplying  Freeport-
McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in  Indonesia  crashed on Papua island
yesterday near its Grasberg mine, killing three people.  A New Zealand pilot and two Indonesian contract workers
were on board the helicopter, Ramdani Sirait, a Jakarta-based
spokesman of PT Freeport Indonesia said in a text message today.  “The company’s emergency team found the helicopter’s
wreckage in a valley in Mimika regency this morning and
evacuated three victims to Tembagapura hospital,” Sirait said.  Labor disputes over wage increases in recent months had
disrupted operations at the Grasberg mine, which contains the
world’s biggest recoverable copper reserve. Production was cut
in 2011 because of a three-month strike that ended in December.  The company resumed mining and milling operations last week
after a dispute among employees at the mine temporary halted
operations on Feb.23, the Phoenix-based  Freeport (FCX)  said in a
statement posted in its  website . Full production is expected to
be reached in the second quarter of 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
