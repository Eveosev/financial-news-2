Greek ferry services from the main
port of Piraeus, a jumping off point to the country’s islands,
will be halted for two days from March 19 by a sailors’ strike.  The Pan-Hellenic Seamen’s Federation will begin the action
at 6 a.m., according to a statement posted on its  website .  The protest is against weakening of collective bargaining
agreements and abolishing rules that require ships operating in
Greek waters under foreign flags to employ local sailors. A
planned week-long strike in November 2010 was called off after
the Greek government ordered striking sailors back to work.  To contact the reporter on this story:
