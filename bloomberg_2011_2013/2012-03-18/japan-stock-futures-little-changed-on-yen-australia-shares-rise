Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed as the yen rebounded, damping the earnings outlook for
exporters. Declines may be limited ahead of U.S. data that’s
forecast to show the housing market is improving. Australian
stocks rose after oil prices increased.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s
second-largest carmaker by market value, fell 0.4 percent from
the closing share price in  Tokyo . ADRs Komatsu Ltd., Japan’s
biggest construction machinery maker, dropped 0.4 percent after
China’s February home prices posted the worst performance in a
year. BHP Billiton Ltd., the No. 1 Australian oil producer,
gained 0.9 percent in Sydney.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 10,035 in Chicago on March 16, compared with
10,060 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at
10,060 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slipped
0.1 percent in Wellington.  “Investors are likely to take profits today with a lack of
news to move the yen,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant
manager of investment strategy at Okasan Securities Co. in
Tokyo. “But with a positive housing report expected from the
U.S. and hopes for some easing from Japan’s central bank,”
declined could be limited, he said.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a seven-
day gain on March 16 after an increase in oil and consumer
prices sparked inflation concerns as the  U.S. economy  improves.  U.S. Housing  Home purchases in the U.S. probably climbed in February to
the highest level in almost two years, another sign of
stabilization in the real-estate market, economists forecast
reports this week will show.  Combined sales of new and previously owned properties rose
to 4.93 million at an annual rate, the strongest since May 2010,
from 4.89 million in January, according to the median forecasts
in a Bloomberg News survey. Home construction also improved as
warmer weather bolstered prospects for the industry, another
report may show.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 12 percent this year
through March 16, compared with a 12 percent gain by the S&P 500
and an 11 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 15 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4
times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen strengthened to 83.31 per dollar today, compared
with 83.94 reached on March 16. A stronger yen decreases the
value of Japanese exporters’ profits overseas when repatriated.  Oil traded near the highest price in a week in  New York  as
investors bet that the second-highest Saudi Arabian crude output
since at least 1980 signals fuel demand is increasing.  Crude for April delivery was at $107.36 a barrel, up 30
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 9:54 a.m. Sydney time. The contract, which expires tomorrow,
climbed 1.9 percent to $107.06 a barrel on March 16, the highest
close since March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
