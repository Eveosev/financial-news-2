Sweden’s Andre Myhrer won the
season-ending race to take the men’s  World Cup  slalom title,
while Viktoria Rebensburg of  Germany  secured the women’s giant
slalom competition.  Myhrer, who was third in the standings heading into today’s
event in Schladming, Austria, benefitted from a fall by leader
Ivica Kostelic of Croatia and a mistake by Austria’s Marcel
Hirscher, who failed to finish.  The Swede finished on  644 points  with Kostelic on 610 and
Hirscher on 560. Hirscher won the overall World Cup title and
the giant slalom competition.  Rebensburg defended her giant slalom title, ending the
season with a 195-point advantage in the discipline over Lindsey Vonn of the U.S.  Vonn, already confirmed as the overall champion, only
managed 24th today, missing the chance to break the record of
2,000 points set by Austrian Hermann Maier. The 27-year-old did
set the highest mark in the women’s competition of 1,980 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
