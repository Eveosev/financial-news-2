New Zealand consumer confidence
remained subdued in the first quarter on concern over the
strength of the economy and inflation pressures, a private
survey showed.  An index of household sentiment rose to 102.4 in the first
quarter from 101.3 in December,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
McDermott Miller Ltd. said in an e-mailed report. Confidence
stayed the lowest since a year ago, immediately after an
earthquake devastated the South Island city of Christchurch.  Little confidence suggests weak consumer spending growth in
early 2012, Westpac said. That adds to the case for Reserve Bank
Governor Alan Bollard keeping  interest rates  lower, after he
signaled March 8 that the official cash rate could stay at a
record-low 2.5 percent for much of this year.  “While we’ve seen recent evidence of stronger retail
spending, today’s weak confidence numbers give pause for thought
on how far this upturn in spending has to run,” Westpac Chief
Economist Dominick Stephens said in a statement.  Consumers were pessimistic about  New Zealand ’s economic
outlook, primarily on concerns about recession, wrong economic
policies and price increases, Richard Miller, managing director
of consultant McDermott Miller, said in the statement.  The consumer survey of 1,563 people March 1-11 showed a
slight increase in willingness to buy large-ticket items,
Westpac said. A net 17 percent said it is a good time to buy, up
from 13 percent three months earlier. The net figure subtracts
pessimists from optimists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
