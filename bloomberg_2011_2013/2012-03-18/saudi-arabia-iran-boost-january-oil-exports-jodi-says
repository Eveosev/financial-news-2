Saudi Arabia (OPCRSAUD)  and  Iran  increased oil
exports in January from a month earlier amid higher demand for
crude from OPEC member nations, official data posted on the
Joint Organization Data Initiative’s website showed.  Saudi Arabia , the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, boosted January exports by 2
percent to 7.507 million barrels a day, according to JODI data
released today. Iran, the group’s second-biggest producer,
exported 2.265 million barrels a day, its highest monthly figure
since December 2008, the data showed.  Algeria increased its exports by 18 percent in January to
818,000 barrels a day, while Ecuador boosted shipment by 41
percent to 421,000 barrels a day, data the governments submitted
to JODI showed. Venezuela, Nigeria and  Qatar  lowered exports
during the month, while Angola raised exports by 40,000 barrels
to 1.64 million barrels a day, according to the data. Kuwait,
the United Arab Emirates, Libya and Iraq didn’t submit exports
data for the month.  The 12 members of  OPEC (OPCRTOTL) , which supplies about 40 percent of
global crude, produced 31.42 million barrels a day of crude in
February, the most since October 2008, the Paris-based
 International Energy Agency  said in its monthly oil market
report on March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
