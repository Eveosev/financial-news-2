Axiom Asia Private Capital , run by
former managers of Singaporeâ€™s sovereign wealth fund, has raised
$1.15 billion in a third fund that invests in private equity
managers in  Asia .  About 60 percent of the fund is raised from investors in
the U.S. including  Menlo Park , California-based William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation and Comprehensive Financial Management,
a family office based in  Los Gatos ,  California , according to
Chihtsung Lam, a managing partner at Singapore-based Axiom.  A quarter of the money came from European investors while
most of the remainder was from the  Middle East , Lam, who was
previously with  Government of Singapore Investment Corp. , said
in a telephone interview last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
