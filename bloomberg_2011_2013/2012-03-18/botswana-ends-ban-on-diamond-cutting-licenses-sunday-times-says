Botswana will next month lift a ban
on new licenses for diamond cutters and polishers, the Sunday
Times reported, citing Potso Thari, a spokesman for the minerals
ministry.  The southern African nation will grant new licenses after
the supply of rough diamonds increased following a new sales
agreement between Botswana and  De Beers , the worldâ€™s biggest
diamond miner, the Johannesburg-based newspaper cited Thari as
saying. The diamond-cutting and polishing industry employs 3,000
people in Botswana, the newspaper said, without citing a source.  To contact the reporter on this story:
