Quarterback  Rex Grossman  agreed to
a one-year contract with the  Washington Redskins , who are
expected to take Baylor University’s quarterback Robert Griffin III as the second pick in the National Football League draft.  Grossman, 31, a nine-year veteran, said the prospect of
Griffin starting the season as quarterback didn’t discourage him
from agreeing to terms.  “I’m a firm believer in seeing things through, and I
wanted to be a part of this team in any way possible regardless
of what my role is, and help it get back on track,” Grossman
told the Washington Post.  Last season, he passed for 3,151 yards, 16 touchdowns and
20 interceptions in 13 games. The Redskins ended the season with
a 5-11 record.  Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. Grossman earned
$810,000 last season, the Post said.  The Redskins completed a trade to move up to second pick
from sixth in the draft. The  Indianapolis Colts  are expected to
take Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck  as the first
selection, leaving Heisman Trophy winner Griffin.  “They’re definitely taking a quarterback with the second
pick of the draft,” Grossman said. “It’ll probably be RGIII,
unless for some unexpected reason the Colts take him. But
whether it’s RGIII or Luck, either way, I know that quarterback
is going to be the franchise quarterback at some point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
