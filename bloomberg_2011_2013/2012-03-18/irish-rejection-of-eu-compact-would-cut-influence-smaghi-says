Ireland would lose influence in
 Europe  should voters reject the European Fiscal Compact in a
referendum, former European Central Bank Executive Board Member
Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said today in an interview on RTE.  “If a country votes no, it loses influence in European
matters,” he told the Dublin-based broadcaster. “A country
cannot come to the table and have an agreement and then go home
and have a negative result. If you are in this position you
don’t count a lot in Europe, you tend to be marginalized.”  Ireland is “very close to coming back to the markets,”
Smaghi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
