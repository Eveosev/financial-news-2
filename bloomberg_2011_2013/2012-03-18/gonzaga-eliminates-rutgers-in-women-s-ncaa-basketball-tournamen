No. 11-seeded Gonzaga University
eliminated No. 6  Rutgers University , while top seeds University
of  Connecticut  and  Stanford University  advanced in the opening
round of the women’s national college basketball tournament.  Sixteen teams, including No. 1 seeds Baylor and Notre Dame,
will meet in the second day of the first round of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association contest today.  Gonzaga defeated Rutgers 86-73, Stanford beat No. 16
Hampton 73-51, and Connecticut topped No. 16 Prairie View A&M
83-47 in the 16 games played yesterday.  Rutgers, playing in a Kingston Regional game on Gonzaga’s
home court in Spokane, was overwhelmed by the noise that forced
Scarlet Knights coach C. Vivian Stringer to communicate with her
players via substitutes.  “We couldn’t hear each other,” Rutgers forward April
Sykes told reporters. “The crowd was loud.”  Rutgers fell behind 20-4 and spent the rest of the game
trying to catch the Bulldogs.  “Sometimes we try to outscore people early and get tough
late,” said Gonzaga coach Kelly Graves. “Tonight we focused on
being tough early.”  Kayla Standish scored 23 points and Haiden Palmer added 21
for Gonzaga (27-5). Erica Wheeler scored 28 points for Rutgers
(22-10).  Stanford Wins  At Ted Constant Convocation Center in Norfolk,  Virginia ,
Nnemkadi Ogwumike scored 28 points for Stanford (32-1), which
extended its school-record winning streak to 29 games. Joslyn
Tinkle added 16 points for the Cardinal, seeking their fifth
trip to the tournament’s semifinals.  Stanford will play eighth-seeded  West Virginia , which
topped No. 9 Texas 68-35 yesterday, in the next round of the
Fresno Region tomorrow.  Alyssa Bennett scored 19 points to lead Hampton (26-5),
which set a school record for victories in a season.  At Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut,
freshman Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis scored 21 points for the Huskies
(30-4), while Bria Hartley added 18 points in the Kingston
Region contest.  Connecticut advances to tomorrow’s second round against No.
