West Indies beat  Australia  by five
wickets to end a run of 14 matches without a victory against the
top-ranked one-day cricket team.  In a match reduced to 40 overs a side because of rain in
Kingstown,  St. Vincent , the home team reached the adjusted
target of 158 with 10 balls remaining as Kieron Pollard top
scored with 47. Australia earlier made 154-9.  The victory, West Indiesâ€™ first in a one-day match against
Australia since Oct. 18, 2006, tied the best-of-five contest at
1-1 after the touring team won the opener by 64 runs.  The third game takes place in Kingstown on March 20 before
the series concludes with two matches in  St. Lucia .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
