The  European Central Bank ’s loans
to banks were made in “total consensus” with Germany, European
Central Bank council member and governor of Italy’s central bank
Ignazio Visco told El Pais in an interview.  “I think there was total consensus despite the many
negotiations,” Visco said. While there’s a risk that liquidity
may be transferred, that’s currently unlikely to occur, he said.  While the risk of inflation isn’t very high, one must be
very careful as risk exists for basic products, Visco said.  Banks don’t have to use the loaned money only to buy
 government bonds , Visco said. They should use the money to help
finance the most profitable sectors, he said. The loans won’t be
enough to restore credit in the region if economic conditions
don’t foster demand for loans, Visco said.  Regarding Italian banks,  UniCredit SpA (UNI)  and  Intesa Sanpaolo
SpA (ISP)  must improve profitability while the sector’s overall
situation is good and presents no major issues, Visco said.  Visco said Spain is being “very brave” and that the
government’s action is profound and successful even as it faces
credibility issues in the financial markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
