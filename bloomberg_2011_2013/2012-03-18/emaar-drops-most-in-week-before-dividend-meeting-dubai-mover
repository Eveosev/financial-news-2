Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  decreased the
most in more than a week, leading a decline in Dubai’s stocks,
before the developer of the world’s tallest tower meets tomorrow
to discuss whether it will pay a  dividend for 2011 .  The shares decreased 1.3 percent, the most since March 7,
to 3.06 dirhams at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The stock was the
second-biggest decliner on the index after  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) 
The benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  retreated 1.4 percent. Emaar,
which has the highest weighting on the index, last year agreed
to pay its first  cash dividend  since 2008.  “Investors are waiting for Emaar’s board decision on
whether to recommend cash dividends this year or not,” said
Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  The real-estate developer paid a 10 percent cash dividend
for 2010, a total of about 600 million dirhams ($163 million),
after the company hadn’t initially proposed a dividend. The
decision was made after a three-hour meeting that saw heated
arguments between shareholders and executives.  Emaar on Feb. 14 said fourth-quarter profit surged to 716
million dirhams, beating analysts’ estimates. Recurring income
from hotels and malls grew to 41 percent of revenue last year
compared with 24 percent in 2010.  Fifteen analysts recommend investors buy Emaar shares, two
have a hold and one a sell rating, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
