Vale SA (VALE3) , Brazil’s biggest exporter,
has shut a railroad that transports production from the world’s
largest iron ore mine after a construction accident.  Vale shut the Carajas railroad in northern Brazil after a
bridge it was building next to the rail line collapsed March 16,
the Rio de Janeiro-based company said in an e-mailed statement.
Seven workers suffered “light injuries,” according to Vale,
which didn’t provide an estimate for when transportation would
resume.  The rail line links the Carajas mine with the port of Ponta
da Madeira in the northeastern state of Maranhao, from where
Vale exports iron ore to clients as far away as  Asia . Vale
produced a record 109.8 million metric tons of  iron ore  in
Carajas last year, or about 34 percent of its total output,
according to a Feb. 15 filing.  Vale also ships manganese, copper, fuels and coal along the
892-kilometer (554-mile) line, which uses the world’s largest
train, made up of four locomotives and 330 cars, according to
the company’s  website . Carajas hosts the Sossego mine, Vale’s
main source of copper production.  The railroad also operates a passenger train that
transports about 1,300 people daily.  To contact the reporters on this story:
