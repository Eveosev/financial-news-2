BT Group Plc (BT/A)  plans to spend as much
as 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) plugging a deficit in its
pension fund, the Sunday Times reported, without citing anyone.  BT will pay more than 500 million pounds into the fund by
the end of March, nine months ahead of a previous schedule, the
newspaper said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Livingston is also
“thought to be” studying a further injection of money from the
company’s 1.5 billion pounds of cash, the Sunday Times said.  The phone company may get millions of pounds of extra tax
relief putting funds into the pension, which has a deficit of
5.4 billion pounds, before the U.K. cuts the corporation tax
rate to 25 percent from 26 percent in April, according to the
report. Dan Thomas, a BT spokesman, declined to comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
