Celtic has held exploratory talks
about quitting the Scottish Premier League to move to English
soccer, possibly starting in the third-tier, the People
reported.  Celtic has made contact with  England ’s Premier League and
Football League and a further meeting has been scheduled, the
newspaper reported, citing a source at the club it didn’t name.  Clubs in the Football League, which governs the three
leagues below the Premier League, may vote on the proposal as
early as the end of this season, the newspaper said.   Celtic, which has a 21-point lead in Scotland’s elite
division, would be prepared to join League One in England, the
People said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
