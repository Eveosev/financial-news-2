Afghanistan ’s relationship with the
U.S. has been a “bumpy road,” including “very tragic events”
such as the killing of 16 civilians on March 11, Eklil Hakimi,
Afghan ambassador to the U.S., said on CNN’s “State of the
Union” program.  Afghans, including President  Hamid Karzai , remain committed
to a strategic partnership with the U.S., the envoy said on CNN.  U.S. officials have identified an Army staff sergeant as
the suspect in the March 11 killings, which threaten to erode
U.S.-Afghan relations, drain remaining U.S. and European support
for the war and add pressure to speed troop withdrawals.  Senator  John McCain  of Arizona, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Armed Services Committee, described the massacre as
“a great tragedy” on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Still, he urged
Democratic President  Barack Obama  to “convince Karzai we are
there to win.”  “On a pure military tactical standpoint, we are winning.
But what the president keeps talking about is how fast we are
going to withdraw,” McCain said on NBC. “If the Taliban take
over again, there’s one thing that history shows us: al-Qaeda
will be back with the Taliban.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
