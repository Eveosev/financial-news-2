Dubai’s benchmark  stock index 
retreated the most in more than a week on investor speculation
this year’s rally was overdone and before the board of  Emaar
Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  meets to discuss a dividend payment.  Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest skyscraper, dropped
1.3 percent.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM) , the only publicly
traded Gulf Arab stock market, declined for a third day. The  DFM
General Index (DFMGI)  fell 1.4 percent, the most since March 7, to
1,660.47 at the 2 p.m. close in Dubai. The measure has surged 23
percent so far this year. The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose 0.3
percent.  “It’s a technical correction,” said Nabil Farhat, a
partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities. “Some investors
are on the sidelines awaiting the results of Emaar’s board
meeting, which could impact stocks prices.”  Emaar, which last year agreed to investor demands to make
its first dividend payout since 2008, will meet tomorrow to
discuss distributions for 2011. The company’s shares, up 19
percent so far this year, said last month  fourth-quarter profit 
more than doubled as it cut costs and generated more revenue
from hotels and international operations. Emaar retreated the
most since March 7, dropping to 3.06 dirhams.  Dubai’s stocks gained this year as companies posted
improved earnings and after the emirate’s government said it
expects two of its main companies to refinance debt without
government help. The benchmark stock gauge tumbled 17 percent in
2011 on the heels of the uprisings in the  Middle East  and on
concern that Europe’s debt crisis will slow global growth.  Oil Declines  The value of shares traded in Dubai jumped to 981 million
dirhams ($267 million) on March 5, the highest since April 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  value of shares
traded  declined to about 218 million dirhams today.  Dubai Financial Market decreased 3.4 percent, the most
since March 7, to 1.14 dirhams.  Oil for April delivery fell 0.3 percent to $107.06 a barrel
last week in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Gulf Arab oil exporters, including Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates, supply about a fifth of the world’s oil.  Abu Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  decreased 0.7 percent and
Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  slipped 0.4 percent. Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul
All Share Index (SASEIDX)  gained 0.2 percent, while Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  and
Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  rose 0.1 percent.  Kuwait (KWSEIDX) ’s gauge
increased 0.5 percent.  In North Africa, Egypt’s  EGX30 Index (EGX30)  slumped 2 percent, the
first drop since March 13. In Israel, the  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  gained 0.4
percent, while the yield on the country’s 5.5 percent notes due
January 2022 declined one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 4.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
