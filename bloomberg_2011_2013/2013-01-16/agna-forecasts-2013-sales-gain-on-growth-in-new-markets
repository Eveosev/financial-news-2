Magna International Inc. (MG) , North
America’s largest auto-parts maker, forecast sales growth of as
much as 7.9 percent for 2013 as the manufacturer seeks customers
in new markets.  Revenue this year is forecast to be $31.3 billion to $32.7
billion, the Aurora, Ontario-based company said today in a
statement. That compares with a sales prediction for 2012 of
$30.3 billion to $31.2 billion that Magna made in November. The
average analyst estimate for 2013 sales is $31.8 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our outlook reflects the progress we are making in
expanding Magna’s business outside of our traditional markets,”
Chief Executive Officer Don Walker said in the statement.  Magna bought German automotive-pump manufacturer Ixetic in
November, three months after acquiring full control of a
partnership to make electric-vehicle parts. Revenue growth from
making components will primarily come from  North America , while
sales at European operations will decline, Magna said today.  The operating profit margin for 2013 is forecast to be in
the “mid-5 percent range” of revenue, Magna said today.  Magna is scheduled to report full-year earnings next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
