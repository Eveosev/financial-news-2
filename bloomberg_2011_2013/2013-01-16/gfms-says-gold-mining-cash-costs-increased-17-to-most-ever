Gold producers’ average total cash
costs climbed 17 percent to a record $736 an ounce in the first
nine months of last year,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  The average cash margin increased by $12 an ounce to $915
an ounce as prices advanced, the London-based  researcher  said
today in a report. The average all-in cost of production gained
7 percent last year to about $1,150 an ounce, it said. Output
rose 0.2 percent to a record 2,841.9 metric tons last year and
first-half supply will climb 1.5 percent from a year earlier.  South African gold production slumped 11 percent to 179.8
tons last year due to labor unrest, according to GFMS, a unit of
Thomson Reuters Corp. While Peru’s output declined 2 percent to
184 tons, it moved above  South Africa  to become the fifth-
biggest miner, the report showed. The U.S. and  Russia  were the
third- and fourth-biggest producers last year, after  China  and
 Australia .  Mining companies reduced gold hedges by 20 tons last year
and will probably cut another 6 tons from forward sales in the
first half of this year, compared with 11 tons a year earlier,
the researcher said. Miners can sell future output at fixed
prices to secure loans and may cut hedges by buying back
contracts, adding to demand.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
financial and legal information and trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
