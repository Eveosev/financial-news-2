OPEC reduced its production to the
lowest level in 14 months as budget wrangles in the U.S.,
uncertain impact of stimulus measures in  Japan  and Europe’s
struggle to boost growth cloud outlook for fuel demand.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
output by 465,000 barrels a day in December to 30.4 million, the
lowest since October 2011, led by a reduction in  Saudi Arabia ,
the group said today in its monthly report, citing secondary
sources. That’s 800,000 a day more than the average 29.6 million
the group estimates it will need to provide this year. OPEC kept
is 2013 global demand forecast unchanged.  “Fiscal uncertainties persist,” OPEC’s Vienna-based
secretariat said in the report. “The U.S. is not the only
country faced with fiscal challenges” as the impact of stimulus
in Japan is unclear and “there remains some uncertainty about
the near-term future development” in Europe.  Brent crude futures, trading at about $110 a barrel in
 London  today, advanced 3.5 percent last year as threats to
supply in the Middle East were balanced by risks to demand from
Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. budget dispute.  The drop in OPEC production last month is the steepest
since March 2011, when Libya’s exports were halted during the
uprising against deposed leader  Muammar Qaddafi . Group output
remains 400,000 barrels a day more than the collective target of
30 million reaffirmed at the organization’s most recent meeting
in December.  Saudi Arabia  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, cut
output by 420,800 barrels a day in December to 9.2 million, OPEC
said. The second-largest decline last month was in Iraq, where
supplies fell 196,300 barrels a day to 3 million. Production
also dropped in  Iran , by 20,400 barrels a day to 2.7 million.  In addition to supply data compiled from secondary sources,
OPEC also provides production numbers submitted directly by
member countries. Saudi Arabia pumped 9.023 million barrels a
day in December, according to its submission. The number is the
same as that given by a person with knowledge of the Kingdom’s
oil policy on Jan. 10.  “Saudi Arabia cut its oil output significantly in
December,” said  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG
in  Frankfurt .  OPEC boosted estimates for supplies from outside the group
by about the same amount as it lowered projections for demand
for its own crude.  Non-OPEC producers such as the U.S.,  Canada  and  Brazil  will
bolster output by 900,000 barrels a day to 53.9 million this
year, according to the report. That’s about 85,000 a day more
than OPEC estimated last month.  Global oil demand will increase by 760,000 barrels a day,
or 0.9 percent, this year to 89.6 million barrels, OPEC said.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  The  International Energy Agency , an adviser to consuming
nations based in Paris, will publish its next monthly forecasts
of supply and demand on Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
