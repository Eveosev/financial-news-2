Pakistan’s global bonds fell for a
fourth day after the  Supreme Court  ordered the arrest of Prime
Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf over corruption allegations, while
protesters in Islamabad called for the administration to quit.  The twin jolt precedes an election due by mid-2013 that
would herald the first time a civilian government completed its
five-year term and transferred power through the ballot box.
Tahir-ul-Qadri, an Islamic cleric, rallied thousands of people
in the capital yesterday, vowing to stay until the government
resigned and corrupt politicians are removed from parliament.  “The political uncertainty will hurt investor appetite for
Pakistan assets,” said Rees Kam, a strategist at SJS Markets
Ltd., a Hong Kong-based financial services company that
specializes in fixed income. However, the weakness will be
short-lived as global risk has improved, he said. “A lot of
emerging-market bond funds need to seek yields and  Pakistan ’s
bonds will be under their radar.”  The yield on the 7.875 percent dollar-denominated notes due
March 2036 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
this month’s high of 10.91 percent as of 11:21 a.m. in  Singapore ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate on the 6.875
percent securities maturing in 2017 climbed four basis points to
9.40 percent. Average borrowing costs on Pakistan’s global debt
are 10.8 percent, the highest among 11 Asian indexes compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc.  IMF Obligations  The rupee shrugged off the developments, gaining 0.2
percent to 97.50 per dollar in offshore trading after reaching
the year’s low of 97.75, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
dropped to a record 98.28 on Dec. 17 and lost 7.5 percent in the
past 12 months. The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index
fell 3.2 percent yesterday, the biggest drop since August 2011.  Pakistan is scheduled to repay about $7.5 billion to the
Washington-based  International Monetary Fund  by 2015, with $1.2
billion due in June. A partially disbursed $11.3 billion loan
program expired in September 2011.  The $210 billion economy will probably expand 3.25 percent
in the fiscal year through June, the IMF forecast on Nov. 29,
less than the 4.3 percent predicted by the government.  Fighting with militants along the nation’s northwest border
with  Afghanistan  is sapping the budget and undermining
confidence among businesses that are already struggling with
power outages that have shut factories, left thousands of people
jobless and prompted street protests.  Prime Minister Ashraf took power last year after his
predecessor was removed by top judges for refusing to order the
reopening of graft charges against the president. That
confrontation with the judiciary has distracted the elected
government from quelling an insurgency with the Taliban.  To contact the reporter on this story:
