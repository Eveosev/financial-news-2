Heating oil declined as gasoil
weakened in  Europe , indicating less demand for distillate
exports from the U.S. at a time when inventories are rising.  Futures slid as the February gasoil contract fell $11.5 to
$949.25 a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London , the largest decline since Dec. 6. U.S. stockpiles rose
1.69 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 11 to 132.4 million,
the highest level since March 30, according to the Energy
Department’s Energy Information Administration.  “The fact that gasoil has come off is weighing on heating
oil,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy
Aspects Ltd., a research consulting company in London. “If it
comes off too much, there will be less U.S. exports to Europe.”  Heating oil for February delivery slipped 2.31 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.9882 a gallon at 1:45 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Volume was almost equal to the 100-day
average.  Supplies of  ultra-low sulfur diesel  jumped 3.04 million
barrels to 102.9 million, the most since Feb. 17.  “Europe has been supporting us and the break in gasoil has
taken some of the pressure off prices,” said Phil Flynn, senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Demand for heating oil and diesel over the past four weeks
was 5.2 percent below a year ago.  PADD 1  heating oil supplies  fell a fourth straight week,
dropping 1.75 million barrels to 15.4 million, the department
reported. Inventories are 42 percent below a year earlier.  Gasoline gained as refineries reduced operating rates last
week, boosting speculation that seasonal maintenance will reduce
fuel inventories.  Refinery Utilization  In an indication of future supply tightness, refinery
utilization fell 1.2 percentage points last week to 87.9
percent, the lowest level in eight weeks, according to EIA data.
Crude and other feedstocks processed in U.S. plants sank 1.3
percent to 15.3 million barrels a day, the lowest level since
Nov. 16.  “Between now and May, there will be an average 1.5 million
barrels a day of production offline because of the really heavy
maintenance season,” Sen said.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 0.41 cent to $2.71407 a
gallon. Volume was 34 percent above the 100-day average.  Supplies of the motor fuel increased 1.91 million barrels
to 235 million in the week ended Jan. 11, the highest level
since Feb. 18, 2011. Inventories have jumped 17 percent in eight
weeks and are at the highest seasonal point since the department
began reporting weekly data in 1990.  Gasoline Demand  Gasoline  demand  rose 3.9 percent to 8.32 million barrels a
day. Consumption over the past four weeks is down 0.6 percent
from the same period a year earlier.  “Demand is up but it’s not anything to get too excited
about,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies
Bache LLC in New York. “Utilization should be going down
because we’re headed into turnaround and that should be bullish
for products.”  The average nationwide  retail price  for regular gasoline
fell 0.3 cent to $3.294 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
That’s the fifth consecutive decline and lowest average since
Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
