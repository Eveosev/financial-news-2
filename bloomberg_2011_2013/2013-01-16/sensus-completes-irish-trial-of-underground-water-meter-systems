Sensus, a U.S. developer of water-
metering systems, completed a test of its technology in Ireland
that will enable utilities and homes to better manage use ahead
of the introduction of Irish water charges.  The company successfully connected water meters underground
to long-range radio technology in County Cork in southwestern
Ireland, the Raleigh, North Carolina-based company said today in
a statement. The trial occurred as Ireland plans to introduce
water charges to consumers next year, it said.  “The insight and intelligence that comes from the data
generated by smart meters is critical,” Neil Adams, business
development manager for Sensus, said in the statement. “It
gives water utilities greater visibility of their networks and
provides information that can help them manage their networks
more efficiently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
