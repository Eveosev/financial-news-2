Iron ore  will see another year of
“exceptional prices” before supplies start to outpace demand,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today as it increased its forecast
for the seaborne commodity used in steel.  Prices will probably average $144 a dry ton in 2013, up
from $140 estimated previously, the bank said in an e-mailed
report. The ore may decline to $126 in 2014 before averaging $90
in 2015 and $80 in 2016, it said.  Iron ore surged 76 percent since dropping to a three-year
low in September on optimism China, the biggest buyer, is
recovering. JPMorgan Chase & Co. today increased its 2013
estimate to an average $130 from $110, while Deutsche Bank AG
said Jan. 8 prices may climb to $170 in the first half before
falling below $120. Rio Tinto Group, the second-biggest
exporter, posted yesterday better-than-expected output for the
fourth quarter and said it will press ahead with expansion.  The “market is headed for a long period of significant
oversupply, but in our view this is still two years away,” said
Goldman. “We expect iron ore producers will see one last year
of exceptional prices and profit margins” as the “ restocking 
phase continues, supply starts to tighten and  market sentiment 
becomes more bullish,” the report said.  Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin declined a fourth day, dropping 1.1 percent to
$152.90 yesterday, according to  data  from The Steel Index Ltd.
Prices climbed to $158.50 on Jan. 8, the most expensive since
Oct. 13, 2011 after rallying 39 percent in the three months
through December, the most since at least 2009.  Unwilling Buyers  The rally prompted Chinese steelmakers to use more domestic
supplies, a  survey  by Mysteel.com showed. Higher prices will
stop mills from rebuilding inventories, according to Hebei Iron
& Steel Group and  Maanshan Iron & Steel (323)  Co. The country’s
steelmakers are unwilling to buy imported ore at above $150, UBS
AG analyst Hubert Tang said yesterday.  Prices will drop from an average $145 in the first quarter
this year to $120 in the fourth quarter as new supply comes on
stream, Fraser Jamieson, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in a
report. The bounce in prices from September while China’s
production was stable suggests restocking, “which we estimate
will come to an end around Chinese new year in early February
when activity typically slows,” he said.  Imports last month climbed to a record 70.94 million tons
from 65.78 million tons in November, customs data show.  “Strong demand growth in  China  has induced the development
of low-grade, high-cost operations that require relatively high
prices in order to remain viable,” said Goldman. “As long as
those mines remain in operation, we believe the seaborne price
will be supported at a high level.”  The growth in the China’s steel output will accelerate to
4.9 percent in 2013, while inventory levels in the country’s
ports of 73 million tons are at their lowest since January 2011,
said Goldman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
