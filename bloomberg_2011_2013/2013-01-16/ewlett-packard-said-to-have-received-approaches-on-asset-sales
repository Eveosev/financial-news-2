Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  has been
approached by investment bankers about selling assets, though
it’s not currently considering such a move, according to a
person with knowledge of the matter.  The company has seen an increase in inquiries after a
regulatory filing late last year that said it would consider
disposing of businesses that don’t meet goals, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the overtures were
private. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported today that
Hewlett-Packard’s Autonomy and Electronic Data Systems divisions
had attracted interest from possible suitors.  Under Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman , Hewlett-Packard
has taken $16.8 billion in writedowns related to the diminishing
value of the EDS computer-services business and the computer
maker’s allegations that Autonomy misrepresented its financial
health before it was acquired in 2011.  Hewlett-Packard rose 4.1 percent to $17.21 at the close in
New York after earlier climbing as much as 4.8 percent following
the newspaper report on asset-sale inquiries.  Michael Thacker, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-
based Hewlett-Packard, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
