U.S. exports of gasoline and other
refined oil products last year probably exceeded the nation’s
fuel imports from as recently as 2009 as strengthening demand
from  Latin America  spurred a fourfold gain in ship charters.  Refineries’ petroleum-product shipments exceeded imports by
an average of 935,000 barrels a day in the first ten months of
last year, U.S. Energy Information Administration  figures 
compiled by Bloomberg show. Inbound shipments topped deliveries
by 841,000 barrels daily in 2009, according to the data.  U.S. oil-product exports to  Venezuela  more than doubled in
the period, according to the EIA. Latin American and Caribbean
economies will expand 3.9 percent this year, almost twice as
fast as the U.S., the  International Monetary Fund   predicted  in
October. DVB Bank SE said last month rising U.S. shale-gas
output would spur shipments of refined products.  “Refineries in the U.S. Gulf now being a competitive
exporter to the rest of the world is a theme that’s going to be
going on for a multiple of years,” Robert Bugbee, president of
 Scorpio Tankers Inc. (STNG) , said Jan. 14 by phone. The Monaco-based
company has a fleet of 31 product tankers.  The number of tankers chartered last year for single
voyages to haul refined products to Central and  South America 
from the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic coasts more than quadrupled from
2009, according to figures from shipbrokers compiled by
Bloomberg. Bookings came to 288 in 2012, compared with 64 three
years earlier.  Gasoline, Naphtha  The world product-tanker fleet is benefiting from extra
business generated through exports from the U.S. of  jet fuel  and
gasoline to West Africa and naphtha to  Asia , according to
Bugbee. The routes only evolved over the past 12 to 24 months,
he said.  U.S. oil-product shipments exceeded inbound cargoes by
368,000 barrels a day in 2011, the first time since 1949 the
country was a net exporter, the EIA data show. Total world
imports last year came to 18.5 million barrels a day, according
to Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) , the state-controlled Brazilian  oil
company  known as Petrobras, was the biggest user of product
tankers on the U.S.-to-Latin America route last year, the
shipbroker data showed, hiring 110 vessels. BP Plc was second
with 21 ships. Not all bookings are reported to the market, and
charterers were unknown or unreported for 33 voyages last year.  Distillate  exports  from the U.S. averaged 1 million barrels
a day in the first 10 months of 2012, up 21 percent from a year
earlier, according to EIA figures. Jet-fuel exports climbed 28
percent to average 124,000 barrels daily. The U.S. delivered
more oil products to countries from Argentina to Honduras in the
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
