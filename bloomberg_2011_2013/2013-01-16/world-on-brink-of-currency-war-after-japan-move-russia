The world’s leading economies are on
the brink of a “currency war” to keep up with  Japan  and use
devaluation to boost their competitiveness,  Russia ’s central
bank said.  “Japan is weakening the yen and other countries may
follow,” Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev 
said at a conference in Moscow today.  The yen touched its lowest level in two years this week
against the dollar on bets the  Bank of Japan  will raise its 1
percent inflation target and introduce more monetary stimulus at
its Jan. 21-22 meeting. The euro remained lower following a drop
yesterday after Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said the
currency shared by 17 nations is “dangerously high.”  Reciprocal devaluations would hurt the global economy,
Ulyukayev said today. Russia’s central bank, which manages the
world’s fourth-largest stockpile of international reserves,
didn’t buy or sell dollars or euros in December for the first
month since at least August 2008, when the regulator started
publishing the data.  The ruble was little changed at 30.346 per dollar at the
start of official trade today. The Russian currency was also
steady versus the euro at 40.30 and at 34.821 against the
 dollar-euro basket  the central bank uses to minimize swings.  ‘Counterproductive’  Bank Rossii is unlikely to undertake its own monetary
easing measures anytime soon because the economy is already
expanding in line with its potential under current circumstances
of about 3.5 percent a year, Ulyukayev said. Cutting  interest
rates  or taking “quantitative easing” measures would be
“counterproductive” at the moment, Ulyukayev said.  Russia’s central bank left key borrowing costs unchanged in
a review yesterday, holding the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent
for a fourth month, as forecast by all 19 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  The euro, which has gained 8 percent versus the dollar in
the past six months, tumbled today as much as 1.8 percent to
117.60 yen before trading at 118.14 yen, down 1.3 percent. It
reached 120.13 yesterday, the highest since May 2011. The
Japanese currency appreciated 0.8 percent to 88.79 to the
greenback after weakening yesterday to 89.67, the lowest level
since June 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
