second day as oil and gas stocks led declines after the World

realize that the limit can’t continue to be raised because this
eats up the nation’s economic future,” Sergey Kucherenko, who
manages about $50 million in Russian equities at Nomos Bank in
Moscow, said by phone. “Since the American economy is the

resolved.”  The amount of shares traded on the Micex was 49 percent

percentage point and predicted a second year of contraction in
the euro region. It also lowered projections for  emerging
markets  led by  Brazil ,  India  and  Mexico .  OAO Raspadskaya, a coal producer, rose as much as 1.8
percent before closing up 1.2 percent at 69.12 rubles, the

by assets, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, posted fourth-quarter profit increases, beating
analysts’ estimates.  The Micex gauge trades at about 5.6 times  estimated
