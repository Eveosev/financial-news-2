Norwegian politicians, central
bankers and business leaders have joined forces in a push to
weaken the world’s most overvalued currency.  The krone surged to a record this month as crisis-scarred
investors sought refuge in AAA rated  Norway , which boasts a $700
billion sovereign wealth fund built from its oil resources. The
krone is 40 percent overvalued, topping both the Swiss franc and
the Australian dollar, according to a gauge compiled by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  The currency’s strength poses a threat to exporters such as
 Norsk Hydro ASA (NHY)  and is creating a dilemma for policy makers amid
soaring home prices and bulging household debt levels. The
“main” cause of Norway’s cost disadvantage stems from the
krone’s appreciation, said Kristin Skogen Lund, chief executive
officer of the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise.  The government is trying to adjust fiscal policy to avoid
fueling the krone’s strength in an effort to ease pressure on
the central bank, Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen said in an
interview yesterday. Norges Bank Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad
earlier this week indicated that persistent currency strength
could prompt the bank to rethink its plans to raise rates as
early as March.  “The strong krone deepens the challenge” for Norwegian
businesses, Johnsen said. The government will help “ease the
burden for the governor of the central bank” by conducting a
“tight” fiscal policy, he said.  The minister’s comments are “an attempt of vocal
intervention,” London-based Citigroup Inc. analyst Tina Mortensen said in a note to clients today.  ‘Obvious Effect’  Norges Bank kept the bank’s  overnight deposit rate 
unchanged at 1.5 percent for a fifth meeting last month and
signaled a possible rate increase may be needed after low
borrowing costs fueled household credit growth and sent  home
prices  to records.  Since then, the  import-weighted krone  index reached 84.7
this month, its strongest level since at least 1999. The index
has also appreciated beyond the central bank’s 85.75 forecast
for this year. A lower reading indicates a stronger currency.  “If the krone is as strong as it is now for a long time,
also until March, that of course has an obvious effect on the
 interest rate ,” Qvigstad said this week after holding a speech
at the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen.  The krone has been the second-worst performing major
currency against the euro and the dollar this week, after the
Swiss franc, according to Bloomberg data. The currency has
weakened 0.7 percent against the euro and 1.1 percent versus the
dollar since Monday. It traded at 7.4152 and 5.5619 respectively
by 9:43 a.m. in Oslo.  The world’s fourth-richest nation per capita is
withstanding a recession in the euro area, and even displaying
signs of overheating, amid record investment in Norway’s
petroleum industry.  House prices  have doubled since 2002 and
were up an annual 7.7 percent last year, according to the
Norwegian Association of Real Estate Agents.  Overheating Risks  Weak global growth prospects have curtailed the Norwegian
central bank’s scope to address overheating risks without
fueling krone gains. Central bankers in the euro area, the U.S.
and  Japan  have resorted to additional stimulus, pushing rate
increases further out into the future.  “There’s no doubt that the continued appreciation of the
krone puts Norges Bank in a difficult position, especially given
that the economy is operating above full capacity and risks of
financial imbalances are building,” Citigroup’sMortensen said
in a note yesterday.  Nordea Bank AB and DNB ASA cut their interest rate
forecasts this week, saying they now predict unchanged rates
through 2013. Nordea sees the first rate rise in March 2014,
while DNB sees unchanged rates until December 2014. Both banks
cite krone strength and new banking regulation as key reasons
for the change.  Policy makers have cut the benchmark twice since December
2011 to ease the pain for exporters. Exports fell an annual 9.7
percent in December, according to  Statistics Norway .  “The main part of Norway’s cost disadvantage comes from
its currency,” Skogen Lund, who heads the country’s biggest
employers’ group, NHO, said in an interview. Reining in public
spending would be the “most effective” tool to reduce Norway’s
cost disadvantage, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
