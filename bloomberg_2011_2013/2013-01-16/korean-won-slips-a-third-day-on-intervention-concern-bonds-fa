South Korea ’s won dropped for a
third day on concern authorities will take steps to stem the
currency’s recent gains after it touched a 17-month high this
week.  Government bonds  fell.  The government may curb exchange-rate volatility further
and recent movements in the won were probably too fast, Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan said Jan. 14. South Korea is studying
various measures to reduce volatility in capital flows and
currency movements, Vice Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said
today.  The won fell 0.2 percent to 1,058.73 per dollar at the 3
p.m. close in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,054.49 yesterday, the strongest level since August
2011, after rallying 8.3 percent in 2012, the best performance
among the 11-most traded Asian currencies.  “There’s wide market consensus that recent gains in the
won are overdone,” said Hong Seok Chan, a currency analyst at
Daishin Economic Research Institute in Seoul. “Speculation that
the government and the central bank don’t favor further gains in
the currency is keeping the won from rising.”  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said Jan. 14 the
nation will take an “active” response on the won if needed.
Measures to slow the won’s appreciation could include
“smoothing operations,” Kim said, adding authorities should
act to normalize the  exchange rate . He said today that South
Korean exporters are less vulnerable to the won than before.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.83
percent, according to Korea Exchange prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
