Vermont licensed 32 so-called
captive insurers last year as construction and manufacturing
firms turned to the state as they established self-insurance
programs.  New licensees, including  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,
 Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) , bring Vermontâ€™s
total to 984, according to a news  release  today from the state.
Vermont licensed 41 captives in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
