 The  Jersey Shore  is likely to be
fully restored by 2014, Governor  Chris Christie  said at his
100th town-hall meeting, where he highlighted his response to
 Hurricane Sandy  that has earned him record approval ratings as
he runs for re-election.  Christie, 50, wants to have  New Jersey ’s coast
“functional” for this summer, he said today at a church in
Manahawkin, a beach community hit by the Oct. 29 storm.  New Jerseyans  must “adjust our expectations,” said
Christie, a first-term Republican.  The town halls put Christie in front of voters as he
pitches his agenda to mostly friendly crowds. He may find them
crucial as he seeks a second term with the state’s jobless rate
almost 2 percentage points above the U.S. figure and revenue
$426 million below his targets midway through the fiscal year.  Christie took office in January 2010 and held his first
town hall that September at a boathouse on Packanack Lake in
Wayne. The town halls have generated 165 YouTube videos that
have been viewed a total of 2.6 million times, according to
Christie’s office. More than 30,000 people have attended.  His two meetings since Sandy have been on rebuilding. The
storm left 2.7 million residents without power, crippled mass
transit and leveled beach towns and boardwalks. For weeks
afterward, Christie appeared daily for televised recovery
briefings, surveying damage with President  Barack Obama , a
Democrat, and hugging victims amid the ruins.  Christie said Nov. 26 he will seek a second term to oversee
the $36.9 billion job of rebuilding. He raised $2.1 million for
his re-election bid through December, his campaign said
yesterday. State Senator Barbara Buono, the only Democrat so far
to  declare  her candidacy, has raised about $250,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
