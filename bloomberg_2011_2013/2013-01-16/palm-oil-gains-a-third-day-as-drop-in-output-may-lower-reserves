Palm oil  climbed for a third day on
speculation that stockpiles in  Malaysia , the world’s second-
largest producer, may drop from a record as output falls and
demand recovers in India and Pakistan.  The contract for delivery in March, which had the largest
open interest, advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 2,428 ringgit
($805) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, and
ended the morning session at 2,421 ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. That
helped trim losses to 0.7 percent this month.  Production in Malaysia, the largest grower after Indonesia,
is typically at its lowest in January and February every year.
Output dropped 5.9 percent to 1.78 million tons in December from
a month earlier, while  stockpiles  reached an all-time high of
2.63 million tons, according to the nation’s palm oil board.  “The low-production season has already started,” Rajesh
Modi, a trader at Sprint Exim Pte., said by phone from
Singapore. “Demand is coming in as  soybean oil  and palm oil’s
difference continues to be high. There’s continuous demand from
India and Pakistan.”  Soybean oil’s  premium  over palm oil was at $320.20 a ton
today, compared with a five-year average of $179.90 a ton,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Soybeans for March
delivery gained 0.4 percent to $14.1975 a bushel on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery in March was little
changed at 50.90 cents a pound.  Futures may rally to as much as 2,615 ringgit in the coming
months, Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz Risk
Management Services Pvt. Ltd., said from Mumbai.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May increased 0.9 percent
to 6,784  yuan  ($1,091) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for September rose 0.6 percent to 8,664 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
