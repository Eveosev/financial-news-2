The foreign-exchange industry will
see many brokerages close or be bought out as they struggle to
cope with a decline in business, according to Brendan Callan,
chief executive officer for Europe at  FXCM Inc. (FXCM)   “Small firms won’t survive” as low volatility levels cut
volume and revenue, Callan said at a briefing in London today.
FXCM, an online currency broker, expects to be “very
aggressive” in acquisitions, he said.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G7 Volatility Index, derived from
premiums on foreign-exchange options, dropped to the least since
2007 last year as record-low central-bank interest rates and
exchange-rate controls damped rewards of currency trading.  The index was as low as 7.06 percent on Dec. 18, down from
as much as 26.55 percent in October 2008. It rose to 8.43
percent today.  FXCM saw trading volume by retail customers fall 9 percent
in the fourth quarter from a year earlier to $886
billion, according to company data. FXCM sees foreign exchange
market volatility increasing through this year, Callan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
