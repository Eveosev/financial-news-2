Lithuania ’s plan to adopt the euro
in 2015 may have to be pushed back two years or more unless the
government enacts measures to slow inflation,  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  said.  Inflation will accelerate to 3.3 percent this year and 3.4
percent in 2014 from the current 3.1 percent, which is already
too high to qualify for the European Union’s common currency,
the lender’s Vilnius-based unit said in a report on its website
today.  “The government should start to apply concrete measures to
ensure the stability of prices,” Nerijus Maciulis, Swedbank’s
chief economist for Lithuania, said in the report. “Otherwise
it may have to delay euro zone membership until 2017 or even
later.”  Like neighbors Latvia and Estonia, Lithuania has one of the
EU’s fastest growing economies. Euro adoption after 2015 will
probably make it the last of the three Baltic countries to adopt
the euro and reduce borrowing costs and facilitate trade with
other EU members.  Estonia  adopted the euro in 2011 and Latvia
plans to do so next year.  A decision by Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius’s government, which took office in December, to
increase the minimum wage by 18 percent from Jan. 1 will boost
inflation by half a percentage point this year, according to
Swedbank. Rising prices of food, electricity, diesel fuel and
tobacco will have a similar effect, the bank said in its report.  Gross domestic product would increase 4 percent this year
and next, Swedbank said, cutting its previous forecast of 4.1
percent growth this year and 4.5 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
