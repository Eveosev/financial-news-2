     Jan. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc., which
adopted measures to discourage a buyer amid speculation it’s an
acquisition target, plans a 71 percent increase in its U.S. shop
network by 2017 after restraining growth this fiscal year.  Krispy Kreme is targeting 400 outlets domestically,
compared with a 234-store network in the 12 months through
January 2012 and 240 in the year ending this month, the Winston-
Salem, North Carolina-based retailer said today in a statement.
It reiterated a target set a year ago of expanding franchises
abroad to 900 outlets in 2017 versus 506 currently.  The company “remains keenly interested in enhancing
returns to shareholders” following a stock buyback in the first
half, it said.  The takeover-prevention plan is aimed at discouraging
investors from buying 5 percent more of Krispy Kreme’s stock by
limiting the way previous operating losses and other credits
could be applied to future taxes, the company said yesterday.
The retailer has become a potential takeover target since Chief
Executive Officer James Morgan boosted sales with an expanded
menu that includes such healthier items as oatmeal, fruit juice
and smoothies.  Krispy Kreme has surged 60 percent in the past 12 months,
including a 22 percent jump this month. The stock  fell  3.2
percent to $11.44 at the close yesterday in  New York  following
the tax-strategy announcement.  U.S. franchise-outlet growth will be “primarily outside
the southeast,” while company-owned store openings will be
focused on its home region, Krispy Kreme said today.
International store-development agreements are in place in
countries including India, Russia and  Mexico , it said.  Competitor  Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. (DNKN)  said its Dunkin’
Donuts baked-goods chain plans growth of as much as 24 percent
in net new restaurants this year from 291 new outlets in 2012.
The Canton, Massachusetts-based company intends to enter the
southern California market in 2015, and is recruiting potential
multi-unit franchisees for the area, it said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
