Odin Forvaltning AS, which holds 4.7
percent of  Pronova BioPharma ASA (PRON) , said that it is still “not
satisfied” with  BASF SE (BAS) ’s higher offer for the Norwegian drug
ingredient maker.  Odin is reviewing the new offer, said Alexandra Morris, a
fund manager at the  investment company . BASF yesterday raised
its bid for Pronova by 8 percent, offering shareholders 13.50
kroner. The German chemical maker also reiterated that the offer
is contingent on getting 90 percent of shares.  Pronova declined as much as 4.5 percent to 12.65 kroner
today and was down 2.6 percent as of 1:28 p.m. in Oslo trading.  Odin’s dissatisfaction with the price highlights the
uncertainty of the deal, which values the maker of Omega 3 fatty
acids at almost 5 billion kroner ($900 million). BASF’s improved
offer came after about 20 percent of Pronova investors said they
were unhappy, according to Odin.  “The entire bid situation has become more complicated,”
said Kristofer Liljeberg, an analyst at Carnegie Investment Bank
AB in  Stockholm . While the analyst said it is unlikely that BASF
would withdraw from the bid, the share price may fall to as low
as 10 kroner if it did.  To contact the reporter on this story:
