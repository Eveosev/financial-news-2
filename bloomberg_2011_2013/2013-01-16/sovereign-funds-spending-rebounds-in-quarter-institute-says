Sovereign wealth funds’ direct
investments picked up in the fourth quarter from a year earlier,
signaling a rebound after spending dropped to a six-year low in
2012, the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute said.  Full-year direct spending, which excludes money outsourced
to other funds or asset managers, slumped 36 percent to $57.3
billion, the Las Vegas-based institute said in an e-mailed
 statement . That’s the lowest since 2006, when direct investments
amounted to $14.8 billion, it said.  “The fourth quarter of 2012 finished off the strongest in
direct transaction amounts,” the institute said. “In fact, the
fourth-quarter transaction amount for 2012 has topped 2011 and
2010 by a hair, but not 2009.”  While the  MSCI World Index (MXWO) ’s biggest gain in three years
drove valuations of stocks higher, a measure tracking  volatility 
showed the gauge eased in the second half after peaking in June.
The sovereign funds more than doubled their spending in
consumer-staples companies and added more information-technology
and real-estate investments, while cutting holdings in banks,
telecommunications and media, the institute said.  Sovereign wealth funds usually manage surpluses from
reserves and exports of oil and other commodities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
