Russia ’s Micex- RTS stock exchange  may sell shares in an initial public offering in  London  and Moscow as soon as February, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The sale is set to raise as much as $1 billion, valuing the exchange at about $4 billion, said three people, who asked not to be named as the details aren’t public.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  and VTB Capital are among banks managing the IPO, two people said.  Officials at Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and Micex-RTS declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Sberbank didn’t immediately comment and an official at VTB didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Russian companies including freight company NTS Holding Plc and payments operator Qiwi are considering IPOs after Russia’s second-largest cellular operator  Megafon OAO (MFON)  raised $1.83 billion in an IPO in London and Moscow last year.  Initial public offerings in  Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa  raised $13.7 billion last year, less than half what companies sold in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The news was previously reported by RIA’s Prime news service.
