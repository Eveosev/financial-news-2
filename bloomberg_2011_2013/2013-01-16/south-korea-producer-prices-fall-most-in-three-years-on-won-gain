South Korean  producer prices  fell
the most in three years as a strengthening won dragged down the
cost of imported oil and raw materials.  Prices declined 1.2 percent in December from a year
earlier, the biggest fall since October 2009, after a 0.9
percent drop in November, the Bank of Korea said in a statement
today. They fell 0.3 percent from the previous month.  Today’s data signal that won gains may help to keep
consumer prices in check even as incoming President Park Geun
Hye seeks to boost economic growth. South Korea’s currency
climbed this week to the highest level against the dollar since
August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent in 2012, the best
performance among the 11-most traded Asian currencies.  The central bank changed the base year for calculating the
producer price index to 2010 from 2005 in a regular update,
according to a separate statement today.  The Bank of  Korea  held its benchmark interest rate at 2.75
percent last week and forecast economic growth of 2.8 percent
this year, with consumer price inflation of 2.5 percent. The
central bank next sets rates on Feb. 14.  The won fell 0.2 percent to close yesterday at 1,058.73 per
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,054.49 this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
