Simon Robey, a former  Morgan Stanley (MS) 
deal maker, is teaming up with  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  Chairman
Simon Robertson to provide corporate finance advice.  Robey, Morgan Stanley’s former co-chairman of global
mergers and acquisitions and head of its U.K. operation, will
join Robertson’s company, which will be renamed Robertson Robey
Associates LLP, the firm said in an e-mailed statement today.  Robey, 52, joins deal makers including Michael Zaoui and
Yoel Zaoui, former M&A bankers at Morgan Stanley and  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  respectively, in setting up their own firms or
joining smaller advisory boutiques amid a dearth of takeovers.
Robertson, 71, has been in  investment banking  for more than 45
years for companies including Goldman Sachs.  Both Robertson and Robey “have worked closely together
over many years” and “will partner to combine the depth and
breadth of their advisory and transaction experience at one
firm,” the company said in the statement.  Robey was part of the team at Morgan Stanley that advised
BAE Systems Plc on its merger talks with European Aeronautic,
Defence & Space Co., two people with knowledge of the talks said
last year. He also advised HBOS Plc, Britain’s then-biggest
mortgage lender, on its 2008 acquisition by  Lloyds Banking Group
Plc (LLOY) , and worked on the $70 billion merger of British drugmakers
Glaxo Wellcome Plc and SmithKlineBeecham Plc in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
