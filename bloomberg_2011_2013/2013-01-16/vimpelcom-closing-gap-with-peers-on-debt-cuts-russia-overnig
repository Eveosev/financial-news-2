VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  jumped in New York to
the smallest-ever discount versus emerging-market telephone
companies as the mobile company said that it will expand in
Russia while reducing debt and expenditure.  American depositary receipts of VimpelCom rallied 7.1
percent to $11.77 yesterday, to trade at 12 times estimated
earnings. The average valuation for the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Telecommunications Services Index (MXEF0TC)  is 12.5 times. The  Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of U.S.-listed stock rose 0.6 percent,
while  futures  on the RTS Index added 0.5 percent to 157,830.  VimpelCom has slumped 38 percent since 2010 as it gave up
its ranking as Russia’s second-biggest mobile provider by
subscribers to  OAO MegaFon (MFON)  and as the nation’s anti-monopoly
watchdog barred it from paying dividends amid a shareholder
dispute last year. The Amsterdam-based company, which got 42
percent of 2011 revenue from  Russia , aims to cut net debt 17
percent by 2015 and shave $2 billion off spending, Chief
Executive Officer Jo Lunder said in a presentation yesterday.  “The market clearly likes their strategy,” Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp. in Moscow,
said by phone yesterday from  London , where he took part in
VimpelCom’s meetings with analysts. “The question now is how
successful implementation of that strategy will be. Russia
remains a strategically important market for VimpelCom as their
main source of cash.”  VimpelCom wants to invest in boosting the quality of its
services in Russia, Lunder said in London yesterday.  Trading Volume  VimpelCom had 56 million customers in Russia in the third
quarter of 2012, compared with 70.7 million for  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems (MBT) , the country’s biggest mobile phone operator, and
62.8 million for MegaFon, data by Moscow-based researcher
Advanced Communications & Media show.  “Their decision to increase investments into the country
is the right step to make,” Vengranovich said.  The ADRs advanced to the highest level since Oct. 4 in New
York yesterday as trading volume was more than four times the
daily average in the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The jump yesterday was the biggest gain since
Aug. 17, the data show.  VimpelCom was formed in 2011 when its Moscow-based unit
merged with  Italy ’s Wind Telecom SpA to create the world’s
sixth-biggest mobile phone company by subscribers.  Russia agreed in November to withdraw a case against
Fornebu, Norway-based  Telenor ASA (TEL)  for raising its stake in
VimpelCom. The dispute was settled when Altimo Cooperatief
U.A.’s billionaire Russian owner Mikhail Fridman lifted his
voting stake to secure control of the company.  MTS Gains  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, was little changed at $29.89
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the stock futures, declined 0.2 percent to 21.92
points.  Mobile TeleSystems, or MTS, as the company is known,
increased 1.3 percent to $18.99 in U.S. trading. The company’s
Moscow-listed  stock  rose 0.2 percent to 247.75 rubles, or $8.18.
One ADR equals to two shares.  Yandex NV (YNDX) , owner of Russia’s most-used search engine,
slumped 1.8 percent to $22.96 in New York yesterday, with
trading volume 53 percent above the three-month daily average,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The stock fell after  Facebook Inc. (FB) , an owner of a social
network with more than 1 billion users, announced on Jan. 15 a
tool for searching information posted to its website. The move
creates an alternative to services now offered in Russia by
companies such as Yandex,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Mail.ru Group Ltd. (MAIL)   Mail.ru Slides  Mail.ru’s global depositary receipts slipped 0.8 percent to
$31.75 in London yesterday, the lowest level since Dec. 10. The
stock has declined for an eighth consecutive day, losing 11
percent in the longest plunge since its listing on the London
Stock Exchange in November 2010.  Crude oil for February delivery gained 1 percent to $94.24
on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, the highest
settlement level since Sept. 18. Oil increased after the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm, said  stockpiles  fell 951,000 barrels last week.
A gain of 2.2 million was the median of 11 analyst estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  Brent oil for February delivery, which expired yesterday,
added 0.3 percent to $110.61 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe .  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export oil blend,
increased 0.3 percent to $109.14.  Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening 0.2 percent
to 30.611 per dollar yesterday after rising 0.1 percent to
