Cytos Biotechnology AG (CYTN) , a Swiss
developer of an experimental drug for allergic asthma, rose to
the highest in almost three months after saying a problem with a
trial of the product won’t delay results of the study.  Cytos  climbed  3 percent to 4.41 Swiss francs in Zurich, the
highest price since Oct. 24, giving the company a market value
of 98.8 million Swiss francs ($106 million). Almost 270,000
shares changed hands, more than three times the average three-
month daily volume. The stock has advanced 56 percent this year,
for the  second-best gain  on the Swiss Performance Index.  Cytos will replace material to be used in the trial of its
CYT003 drug after a “technical issue” was discovered with the
rubber stoppers used to close injection vials, the Schlieren,
Switzerland-based company said in a statement today.  “Overall guidance for the clinical trial remains
unchanged,” Cytos said. The first results from the study will
be available in the first half of next year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
