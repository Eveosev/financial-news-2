U.K. Energy Minister John Hayes
expects details of the government’s proposed tax breaks for
explorers of shale gas to be released in Spring.  “We are in discussions with the Treasury,” Hayes told
lawmakers today at an Energy and Climate Change Committee
meeting in  London . “All matters are being discussed and
considered. The way it’s being envisaged currently is a way of
stimulating exploration” where the costs are significant.  A ban on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, used to access
the gas was lifted in December by Energy Secretary  Ed Davey , who
set up controls to curb the risks of quakes in drilling for the
resource. Two tremors at Cuadrilla Resources Ltd.’s wells in
northern  England  in 2011 prompted the suspension.  Hayes, a Conservative, said the government expects more
companies to come forward and apply for licenses to drill since
the ban was ended. The government is currently undertaking an
environmental study for the next licensing round, he said.  Fracking involves pushing pressurized fluids into wells to
break apart underground rock formations and unlock gas deposits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
