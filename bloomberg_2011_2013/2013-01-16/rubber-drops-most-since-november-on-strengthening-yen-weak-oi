Rubber slumped by the most in more
than two months as the Japanese currency advanced and crude oil
traded near a one-week low, cutting the appeal of the commodity
used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in June plunged as much as 3 percent to
302.8 yen a kilogram ($3,430 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. That’s the biggest drop for the most-active
contract since Nov. 5. Futures traded at 302.9 yen at 12:33 p.m.  The yen gained against the dollar for a second day amid
speculation the  Bank of Japan  will fail to impress investors
with extra policy measures at its Jan. 21-22 meeting. A stronger
Japanese currency reduces the appeal of yen-based contracts.
Crude, used to make synthetic rubber, traded near the lowest in
almost a week after slipping the most in a month yesterday.  “A series of negative factors including the strengthening
yen pressured rubber prices,” said Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst
at DS Futures Co. in Bangkok.  BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his fellow board members
will review the central bank’s 1 percent inflation goal at their
policy meeting next week. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called
for the target to be doubled and said on Jan. 13 that he wants a
BOJ chief “who can push through bold monetary policy.”  Rubber for delivery in May fell 0.2 percent to 25,425  yuan 
($4,090) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board dropped 0.5 percent to 101.20 baht ($3.38) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
