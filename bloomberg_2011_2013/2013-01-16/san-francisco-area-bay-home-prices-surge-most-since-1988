San Francisco Bay area home prices
surged 32 percent last month, the biggest increase from a year
earlier in at least 24 years, as fewer distressed and more
higher-end properties sold, DataQuick said.  The median price paid for a home in the nine-county Bay
area climbed to $442,750 last month from $335,500 in December
2011, according to the San Diego-based data provider. The median
was the highest since August 2008, when it was $447,000, and the
year-over-year gain was the largest in DataQuick records going
back to 1988.  “At least half that increase is due to a change in market
mix, with sales shifting away from low-cost distress homes
toward more mid-market and move-up homes,” DataQuick said today
in a statement.  The number of homes sold for less than $500,000 decreased
13 percent from December 2011, while those that sold for more
than $500,000 jumped 61 percent, DataQuick reported.  A total of 7,832 new and resale houses and condominiums
sold in the region last month, up 4.5 percent from a year
earlier, DataQuick said. A tight supply of homes on the market
and “a fussy home-loan environment” restrained the number of
properties sold, DataQuick said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
