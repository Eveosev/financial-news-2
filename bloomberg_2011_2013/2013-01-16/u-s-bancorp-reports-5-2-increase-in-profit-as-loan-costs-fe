U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s largest
regional lender, said fourth-quarter profit rose 5.2 percent,
meeting analysts’ estimates, on lower loan-loss provisions.  Net income climbed to $1.42 billion, or 72 cents a share,
from $1.35 billion, or 69 cents, a year earlier, the
Minneapolis-based bank said today in a statement. Excluding
costs tied to a mortgage-foreclosure settlement, earnings were
75 cents per share, matching the  average estimate  of 29 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-year profit increased 16 percent to
a record $5.65 billion, or $2.84, from 2011.  U.S. Bancorp could benefit from a pickup in consumer and
commercial spending as payments represent about one-fifth of
revenue, analysts led by  Matt O’Connor  at Deutsche Bank AG said
in a Jan. 4 note. The company also could continue to gain market
share in mortgages, the analysts wrote. U.S. Bancorp set aside
$443 million for loan losses, an 11 percent decrease from the
fourth quarter of 2011.  “We added more customers and grew market share,” Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Davis , 54, said on a conference call
following results. “We maintained strong and growing capital
and liquidity positions.”  U.S. Bancorp has been focusing on expanding market share in
mortgage banking, a business that’s been a “real positive” for
the company, Davis said in September.  ‘Incremental Volatility’  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded U.S. Bancorp’s debt in
December, saying increases in mortgage banking could expose the
lender to “incremental volatility” and “weaker earnings over
time.” Record-low  interest rates , increased competition in
lending and regulatory costs also could pressure revenue and
profit, Moody’s said in a statement at the time.  U.S. Bancorp fell 0.5 percent to $33.13 at 10:09 a.m. in
 New York . The shares gained 15 percent in the past year through
yesterday, compared with a 23 percent  increase  in the 24-company
 KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   Net revenue increased 0.2 percent to $5.11 billion from a
year earlier as a 4.1 percent gain in net interest income to
$2.78 billion offset a 4.2 percent decline in non-interest
income to $2.33 billion.  That decline was driven by automated teller machines
processing-services income, which fell 25 percent in the fourth
quarter to $83 million from a year earlier. Mortgage banking
revenue surged 57 percent to $476 million.  NIM Narrows  Net revenue for the year was $20.3 billion, a 6.2 percent
increase from 2011.  U.S. Bancorp’s net interest margin, the difference between
what a bank pays in deposits and what it charges for loans,
narrowed to 3.55 percent in the fourth quarter from 3.6 percent
a year earlier.  Average total loans rose 6.4 percent to $220.3 billion as
U.S. Bancorp booked increases in residential mortgages and total
commercial loans. Loan growth should continue at a 4 percent to
6 percent annualized rate, Davis said on the call.  Net write-offs fell 25 percent to $468 million in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier. That figure is expected to
be “stable to modestly down” in the first quarter, Davis said.  U.S. Bancorp said it plans to return 60 percent to 80
percent of earnings to shareholders through dividends and
buybacks, the company said in the statement. The bank said it
anticipates receiving permission to increase the dividend in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
