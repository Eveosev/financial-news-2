The New York Cosmos, whose history
includes Pele and other players among soccer’s biggest names,
submitted a proposal to build a $400 million, privately financed
stadium at Belmont Park race track.  The plan, which includes a 25,000-seat soccer-specific
stadium, nine restaurants, retail stores, a hotel and a
residential community, was submitted to the Empire State
Development Corp. on Jan. 11, the team said in a statement.  If the project is approved, the team said it expects to
break ground next year. The stadium would open in spring 2016.  The Cosmos are scheduled to debut in the seven-team North
American Soccer League this spring.  Major League Soccer, which has a team in Harrison, New
Jersey, wants to build a stadium in Flushing Meadows Park that
would house an expansion team. Flushing Meadows is in New York
City’s Queens borough, about 12 miles from Belmont Park in
Elmont, New York.  The Cosmos began play in 1971, spending 14 seasons in the
earlier NASL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
