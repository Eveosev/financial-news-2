Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest
trading house by market value, is investing $765 million to aid
Germany’s renewable energy shift by helping TenneT Holding BV
connect sea-based wind farms to the  power grid .  Mitsubishi will pay 240 million euros ($319 million) for a
49 percent stake in the BorWin1 and BorWin2 grid connection
projects, and 336 million euros for a 49 percent stake in
HelWin2 and DolWin2, TenneT said today in a  statement . Total
investment in all four projects will be 2.9 billion euros, with
an equity share of about 40 percent, said TenneT.  “Mitsubishi’s equity investment strengthens our balance
sheet and helps us finance our offshore investments,” TenneT
Chief Finance Officer Eelco de Boer said. The projects “show
that the German legal and regulatory framework is attractive for
institutional investors.”  Germany is investing in clean energy after announcing it
will phase out nuclear power by 2022. While it wants to add
25,000 megawatts of sea-based  wind turbines  by 2030, the
expansion has been delayed after TenneT failed to finish grid
connection projects on time. Utilities including  RWE AG (RWE)  and EON
SE threatened to halt investment because of the delays.  The high-voltage cable projects will be able to connect 2.8
gigawatts of offshore wind farms with networks on land, TenneT
said. The grid company operates  power lines  stretching from
Germany’s North Sea coast to the Austrian border south of
Munich, serving about 20 million people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
