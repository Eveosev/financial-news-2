A multistory apartment building
collapsed in the Egyptian coastal city of Alexandria, killing at
least 14 people a day after President Mohamed Mursi came under
fire from his critics after a train crash left 19 members of the
security forces dead.  The 24-apartment building collapsed early today, leaving at
least eight other people wounded, Major-General Abdel-Aziz
Tawfik, the interior ministerâ€™s assistant for the civil defense
forces, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
