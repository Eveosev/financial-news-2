Trading volume for U.S. stocks will
not recover in 2013, after last year marked the lowest level
since at least 2008, according to  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Duncan Niederauer .  Average daily trades for companies listed on U.S. stock
exchanges fell 18 percent  last year  to 6.4 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It was the third straight year of
declining volume.  “It’s probably going to remain light for a while,”
Niederauer said in a Bloomberg Television interview today.  Niederauer, whose NYSE Euronext is planning to merge with
IntercontinentalExchange Inc. this year, also said capital
markets may see more initial public offerings in 2013. U.S.
companies raised $41.2 billion in 2012, compared with about $57
billion in 2007, Bloomberg data show.  “If the market hangs in here at this level, the pipeline
is stronger than it’s ever been,” Niederauer said. “I think
we’re ready for 2013 to be a very, very good year for
issuance.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
