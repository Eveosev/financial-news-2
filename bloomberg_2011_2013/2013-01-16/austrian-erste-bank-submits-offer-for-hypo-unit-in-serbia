Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) 
submitted a letter of intent to buy the Serbian unit of Hypo
Alpe-Adria International AG and is waiting for the Austrian
government’s response, Serbian Beta news agency said.  If the government’s response is negative or the offer is
not acceptable, Erste has a “backup plan” for its expansion in
 Serbia , Beta cited Erste Group Chief Executive Officer Andreas Treichl as saying.  Treichl also said Erste is aiming for “organic growth”
and expansion in the retail banking business in Serbia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
