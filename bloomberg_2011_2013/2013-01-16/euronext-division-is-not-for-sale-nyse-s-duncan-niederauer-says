NYSE Euronext, the exchange operator
that agreed to be bought by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) , said
its European business Euronext is not for sale.  NYSE has been meeting with regulators and investors since
announcing last month it would be acquired by Atlanta-based ICE,
said Chief Executive Officer  Duncan Niederauer  in a Bloomberg
Television interview. While it is still early in the review
process, there are no plans to sell the Euronext business, he
said.  ICE, the 12-year-old energy and commodity futures exchange,
said Dec. 20 it would pay $33.12 for each share of New York-
based NYSE to take control of the world’s biggest equity market.
The deal is set to close in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
