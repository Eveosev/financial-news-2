Nevada Geothermal Power Inc. (NGP) , the
clean-energy company that received U.S. backing for a $98.5
million loan, will transfer ownership of a power plant to EIG
Global Energy Partners LLC to settle a debt.  Nevada Geothermal will give up its 100 percent stake in the
Blue Mountain geothermal field to repay a loan of about $97.4
million, Vancouver-based Nevada Geothermal said today in a
statement. The deal is expected to close within two months.  The company said in September it was considering
transferring the plant to EIG after projecting the facility will
produce less power than expected. The shares fell below one
Canadian cent at the close in Toronto.  The U.S. Energy Department guaranteed 80 percent of the
loan that Nevada Geothermal received in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
