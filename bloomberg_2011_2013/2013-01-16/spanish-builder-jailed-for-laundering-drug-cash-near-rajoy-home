A Spanish builder was jailed for
more than three years by the country’s National Court for
laundering drug money through the construction of a luxury
mansion for a trafficker in the northwestern region of Galicia.  Amancio Costa Alvarez, 51, built a 7,100 square foot two-
story house in the coastal town of Villagarcia de Arosa knowing
that the money he was paid came from drug-trafficking profits,
according to a court ruling published yesterday. A local drug
smuggler in jail during the 1999 construction funneled his
profits through a network of companies and used some of the
revenue to build the home, Judge Carmen-Paloma Gonzalez said in
the report.  Costa’s lawyer Enrique Trebolle didn’t respond to messages
left with his assistant seeking comment yesterday and today.  Costa was friends with the drug kingpin and his wife and
charged them 217,000 euros ($288,000) for the construction of
the house near Pontevedra, the judge said.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  began his career as a property
registrar in the town. The villa, located about 100 meters from
the port area, was valued at 2.2 million euros by officials in
2012, according to the ruling.  Costa told investigators he only knew his friend was
involved in tobacco smuggling, according to the court ruling.
The judge also imposed a 217,000-euro fine on Costa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
