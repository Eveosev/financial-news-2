Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , a Nigerian lender,
climbed to its highest level in 20 months, after FBN Capital
said banking stocks will lead a 15 percent advance in Nigerian
equities this year.  The  shares  climbed 3 percent to 6.80 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest level since May
2011. The volume of securities traded was more than 3 1/2 times
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  FBN Capital set a year-end target price of 8.2 naira for
Diamond, naming the stock its “top pick” in a note released
yesterday. It placed an outperform rating on Diamond,  Skye Bank
Plc (SKYEBANK)  and  United Bank for Africa Plc. (UBA)  Diamond Bank’s first-half
profit through June rose more than fourfold to 9.99 billion
naira ($63 million), from 1.71 billion naira a year earlier, the
lender said on July 11.  The profit climbed because of “a combination of topline
growth and a marked reduction in loan loss provisions,”
according to FBN Capital.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  set up Asset Management Corp.
of Nigeria, or Amcon, which bought bad debts from the nation’s
lenders after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009. This enabled the
banks to enter 2012 with cleaned-up balance sheets, reduced
loan-loss provisions, FBN Capital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
