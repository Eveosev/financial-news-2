The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
said it will conduct a series of “small-value” repurchase
agreements using all eligible collateral types as part of
readiness testing of its operational tools.  The open-market operations, which will begin in the “near
future” and follow a series conducted in August 2012, don’t
represent any change in monetary policy, the New York Fed said
in a  statement  today. In June 2012, the  Federal Open Market
Committee  authorized the New York Fed to undertake repos and
outright purchases and sales of securities, in addition to
reverse repos, for such testing, the New York Fed said.  Prior to the transaction in August, the New York Fed hadn’t
conducted a repo since Dec. 30, 2008. Since 2008, the Fed has
added six primary dealers, the firms that act as counterparties
to the central bank. The New York Fed has 21 primary dealers.  In repos, the Fed buys  U.S. Treasury , mortgage-backed and
so-called agency debt from dealers for a set period, temporarily
raising the amount of money available in the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the dealers, and the
cash to the Fed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
