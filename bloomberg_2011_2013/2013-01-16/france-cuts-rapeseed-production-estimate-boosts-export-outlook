French rapeseed production may be
0.3 percent smaller than forecast in September, while the
outlook for exports was bigger than previously stated, crop
office FranceAgriMer said.  French farmers harvested 5.412 million tons of the oilseed,
less than the previous forecast of 5.428 million tons, the
Montreuil-sous-Bois, France-based crop office  reported  on its
website yesterday. Production in the previous year was 5.349
million tons. Rapeseed exports were pegged at 1.145 million
tons, up from the September forecast of 1 million tons, it said.
Shipments a year earlier were 1.706 million tons, FranceAgriMer
said.  Domestic rapeseed crush was estimated at 4.7 million tons,
down from the September forecast of 4.8 million tons, according
to the report. In the previous season, crushing was 4.24 million
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
