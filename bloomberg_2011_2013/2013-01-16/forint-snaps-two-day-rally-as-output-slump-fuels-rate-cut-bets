The forint weakened for the first
time in three days as a decline in Hungarian industrial output
spurred the outlook for interest rate cuts and after the  World
Bank  cut its global growth forecast.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 295.24 per
euro by 10:34 a.m. in Budapest, extending this year’s slump to
1.3 percent. Yields on  government bonds  due in 2023 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.27 percent.  Recession-hit Hungary’s industrial production fell 6.9
percent in November from a year earlier, matching preliminary
data, the statistics office said today. Demand for riskier
assets slid after the Washington-based bank yesterday projected
the world economy will expand 2.4 percent this year, down from a
June forecast of 3 percent. The bank also lowered projections
for  emerging markets  led by Brazil, India and  Mexico .  “The regional wave of selling caused by diminishing risk
appetite has hit the forint,” Imre Kerekgyarto and Karoly Bamli, Budapest-based traders at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-
mail today.  Hungary’s central bank will today publish minutes of its
December meeting, where policy makers voted to cut the  benchmark
rate  by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 5.75 percent.  Economic growth and industrial output figures point toward
“poor” prospects for 2013, supporting the argument for further
rate cuts, Koon Chow and  Daniel Hewitt , London-based analysts at
Barclays Plc, wrote in a research report e-mailed late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
