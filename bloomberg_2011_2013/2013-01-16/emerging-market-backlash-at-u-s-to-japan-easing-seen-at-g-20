South Korea wants a Group of 20
meeting in Moscow to focus on the adverse effects of U.S.,
Japanese and European Union monetary easing and the need to tame
capital flows, Vice Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon said.  “There are growing concerns over inflation” and the 
spillover effects on emerging nations from the loosening, Shin 
said in Seoul today.  Quantitative easing by developed nations and the impact on
 emerging markets  will be a main topic for the G-20 meeting next
month of central bankers and finance ministers, Shin said. South
Korea’s won touched a 17-month high against the dollar
yesterday, with Shin saying today that officials are studying
various measures to reduce volatility in capital flows and
currency movements.  Measures responding to capital flows “should be recognized
as common policy tools,” the official said. He commented at a
seminar and to reporters.  The won closed at 1,058.73 per dollar in Seoul, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,054.49 yesterday,
the strongest level since August 2011, after rallying 8.3
percent in 2012, the best performance among the 11-most traded
Asian currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
