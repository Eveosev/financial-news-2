Badri Bitsadze, the husband of
opposition leader  Nino Burjanadze , may return to  Georgia  from
exile as part of an amnesty bill, Bakur Bakuradze, a spokesman
for Burjanadze, said today by phone from the capital, Tbilisi.  Bitsadze, whose whereabouts are unknown, was sentenced in
2012 to 5 1/2 in prison for organizing disobedience against
police, charges he denies. Georgia freed this month 190
political prisoners who’d been jailed under the previous
administration as part of an amnesty that also envisages the
return of 25 political exiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
