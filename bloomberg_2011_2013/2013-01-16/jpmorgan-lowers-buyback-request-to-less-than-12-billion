JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, reduced its 2013 stock-repurchase request with
federal bank regulators by at least 20 percent after suffering
its biggest trading loss ever last year.  JPMorgan asked the  Federal Reserve  if it could buy back
less than $3 billion per quarter when it submitted its annual
capital request in January, Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ,
56, told analysts on a conference call today.  The Fed forced the New York-based company to suspend a $15
billion stock-buyback program last year after the bank in May
acknowledged losses in a credit-derivatives portfolio that
eventually swelled to more than $6.2 billion. JPMorgan’s board
of directors cut Dimon’s pay for 2012 in half after a review of
the losses in the chief investment office held him responsible
for the botched trades.  JPMorgan had repurchased $1.6 billion of the $15 billion in
authorized share buybacks when the Fed suspended the program.
The central bank later approved the repurchase of $3 billion in
additional shares in the first quarter, leaving $10.4 billion of
the original buyback goal unused.  Dimon said he is inclined to buy back shares when the price
of the stock falls below tangible book value.  The bank is  projected  to raise its quarterly dividend 16
percent in March to 35 cents a share, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
