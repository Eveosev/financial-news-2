Apple Inc. (AAPL)  retail vice president
Jerry McDougal, an executive once considered a contender for the
job running the company’s chain of stores, is departing.  Jim Bean, a vice president in Apple’s finance division, is
moving over to support the retail effort as McDougal moves on,
Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, said in an interview.  “Retail has an incredibly strong network of leaders at the
store and regional level,” Dowling said. “Jim has been at
Apple for 15 years and is a great leader who understands our
culture and focus on customer service.”  McDougal was a long-time deputy of former retail head  Ron
Johnson , who left in 2011 to run J.C. Penney Co. He also worked
for Johnson’s successor, John Browett, who was dismissed in
October. Apple Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  continues to
seek a new senior vice president to run the company’s retail
operations, according to Dowling.  McDougal’s departure was previously reported by
ifoAppleStore.com, a blog dedicated to Apple’s retail stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
