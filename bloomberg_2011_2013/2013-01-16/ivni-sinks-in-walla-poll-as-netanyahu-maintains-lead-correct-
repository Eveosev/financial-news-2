(Corrects tally of seats for Netanyahu in second
paragraph.)  Tzipi Livni, Israel’s former foreign
minister, dropped in a poll before next week’s election, the
news website Walla! reported today.  Livni’s Hatenuah party would get six seats in Israel’s 120-
seat parliament, down from 11 in a previous poll and compared
with 34 for Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud-Beitenu
slate.  The Walla! poll before Israel’s Jan. 22 election surveyed
500 adult Israelis and had a margin of error of two
parliamentary seats.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
