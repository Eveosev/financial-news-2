China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
dropped to the lowest level since December on speculation
foreign capital inflows will increase as the world’s second-
largest economy recovers.  Yuan  positions  accumulated from foreign-exchange purchases
increased by 134.6 billion yuan ($21.7 billion) in December, the
biggest in 11 months, data published by the central bank
yesterday showed. The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for
seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase contract operations
tomorrow, according to a trader required to bid at the auctions.  “The data are a confirmation of the market’s belief that
capital is flowing into China,” said Pin Ru Tan, a Hong Kong-
based rates strategist at HSBC Securities Asia Ltd. “Generally,
the growth story is there and the  yuan  is no longer on a weak
path like last year.”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, fell one basis
point to 3.33 percent as of 10:54 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  It touched 3.32 percent, the lowest
level since Dec. 28. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped one basis point to 2.80 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  A government report due Jan. 18 will show  China’s economy 
grew 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace in nine
months, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 53 economists.  The yuan has strengthened 0.2 percent this year after
rising 1 percent in 2012.  The yield on the 2.95 percent government bond due August
2017 gained one basis point to 3.25 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
