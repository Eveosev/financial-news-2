China , the largest foreign lender to
the U.S. government, boosted its Treasuries holdings in November
to the most in one year, while No. 2  Japan  added securities for
an eighth-consecutive month.  China’s  position  in the debt increased $200 million, or
0.02 percent, to $1.17 trillion, U.S. Treasury Department data
released yesterday show. Japan’s holdings rose $900 million, or
0.08 percent, to a record $1.13 trillion. For the year, Japan
has purchased $74.4 billion of the securities, more than any
other country, compared with $18.2 billion for China.  Demand for the debt cooled amid a shift in the market’s
focus from the U.S. election in November, won by President
 Barack Obama , to the debate over the scheduled expiration of the
George W. Bush-era tax cuts that were extended in 2010 as part
of a fiscal-stimulus package.  “The Chinese, while arguably less active buyers than they
had been, certainly have structural demand for Treasuries in
defense of their own currency,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-
bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “As long as there are net-positive flows into
China and the  yuan , those flows will produce dollars to be
invested.”  Japan’s holdings are likely to grow “given the fact that
they’re openly planning a foreign-exchange-stabilization fund,”
Lyngen said.  The benchmark 10-year  Treasury yield  fell 0.2 basis points
or 0.02 percentage point, to 1.82 percent yesterday in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  China’s Dilemma  China has “a very large portfolio of Treasuries and they
don’t need to constantly add to it,” said Thomas Simons, a
government-debt economist in New York at Jefferies & Co., one of
21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .
“They’ve publicly announced they have an aim to diversify their
currency exposure. In light of that, it makes sense they’d keep
things close to status quo.”  Lou Jiwei , head of China Investment Corp., said Jan. 14 at
a Hong Kong forum that while  U.S. Treasuries  are “still a safe
asset at the moment,” with an economic recovery, “it’s only a
matter of time that U.S. interest rates will rise and those
bonds will depreciate in value.”  China’s dilemma is that eschewing the debt “reduces our
 portfolio ’s ability to hedge against risks,” Jiwei said. “If
we buy it, over the long term, it’s not a good asset. So our
approach is limited buying.”  The 10-year yield will rise to 2.2 percent by year-end,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
76 economists.  Japan Interventions  Newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has
campaigned to spur growth and seek a more aggressive central
bank has driven down the yen, which would leave the  Bank of
Japan (8301)  to investor proceeds in foreign-currency denominated
assets. China had added U.S. government securities as part of a
strategy to support rapid economic growth, buying the debt to
limit gains in its currency to maintain the pace of its exports.  Japan’s biggest Treasury purchases in the past followed
interventions the  currency market . Japan bought $76.9 billion of
the securities in September 2011 and $59.9 billion of U.S.
government debt in November 2011 after selling 13.59 trillion
yen ($153 billion) in interventions in September and October of
that year.  While China holds $37.8 billion more Treasuries than Japan,
that gap has narrowed from $429.7 billion in July 2011, Treasury
data show. At the 2012 pace of  buying , Japan may overtake China
as the largest holder of  U.S. government debt  in July.  Foreign Holdings  Holdings of Treasuries outside the U.S. rose in November by
$31 billion, or 0.56 percent, the 11th consecutive increase
since December 2011 when foreign ownership declined, the data
show. Foreign investors have boosted their holdings 9.6 percent
through October after climbing 12.8 percent in 2011.  The U.S.  marketable borrowing  reached $11.1 trillion in
November, and was up 11 percent for all of 2012, Treasury data
show.  Foreign investors owned 50.4 percent of the marketable
debt, the least since May, the data, known as Treasury
International Capital, show. China held 10.6 percent of the  U.S.
debt , its smallest share since March 2008. Japan’s stake
comprised 10.3 percent of U.S. government obligations, the least
since October 2011.  Of the $5.56 trillion Treasuries held outside of the U.S.,
72 percent, or $3.96 trillion, are owned by  official
institutions  including central banks, finance ministries and
other fiscal agents, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
