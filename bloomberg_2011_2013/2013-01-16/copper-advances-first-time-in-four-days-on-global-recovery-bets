Copper climbed for the first time in
four days as economic data from the U.S. to  Japan  added to signs
of a global economic recovery, boosting prospects for metal
demand. Aluminum and zinc also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months increased 0.3 percent
to $8,017.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 11:10
a.m. in  Seoul . The metal is 1.1 percent higher this year,
extending a 4.4 percent gain last year, on bets that economic
recovery in  China , the biggest buyer, will increase demand.  “We expect copper to be amongst the better performers in
the base metals space in 2013,” Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. analysts including  Mark Pervan , wrote in a report
today. “Our expectations for a recovery in China and improving
sentiment in the U.S. will underpin stronger demand and push
prices to $9,000 by year end.”  The Commerce Department yesterday said that retail sales in
the U.S. climbed 0.5 percent in December, the most in three
months and exceeding the 0.2 percent forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Japan’s machinery orders rose more than
expected in November.  China’s exports rose more than forecast last month and a
broad measure of credit surged 28 percent, helping the nation’s
new leaders sustain a pickup in economic growth after a seven-
quarter slowdown.  Copper for April delivery gained 0.6 percent to 58,040  yuan 
($9,335) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Copper futures
for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to $3.6435 a pound on the
Comex in New York.  On the LME, lead also rose, while nickel and tin were
little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
