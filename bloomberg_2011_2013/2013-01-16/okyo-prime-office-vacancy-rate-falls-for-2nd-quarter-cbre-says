Tokyo ’s prime office vacancy rate
dropped for a second quarter in the three months ended December,
driven by demand for mid-sized and smaller buildings, according
to CBRE Group Inc.  Grade-A vacancy rate in Tokyo’s central five wards fell to
8.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 9.3 percent in the three
months ended September, CBRE said in an e-mailed statement.
Rents of Grade A buildings declined to 29,800 yen ($338) per
tsubo from 29,900 yen per tsubo in the previous quarter. One
tsubo, a standard measure of property area in Japan, is 3.3
square meters, or 35.5 square feet.  “Inquiries in the fourth quarter were healthy, with demand
increasing at mid-sized buildings,” CBRE said in the report.
“Tenants were looking for larger spaces with improved locations
and quality.”  New supply of  office space , which rose to the highest since
2003 last year, is expected to drop to about a third of 2012
this year, according to a  survey  by Mori Trust Co., a Tokyo-
based developer.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is one of the companies taking advantage of
declining prices on expectations that office market recovery
will lead to higher rents. The New York-based bank said last
month it signed an office lease with  Mitsubishi Estate Co. (8802)  to
move its Japan operations back to Tokyo’s Otemachi business
district amid “attractive conditions for tenants of prime
commercial locations.”  Grade A buildings are defined by CBRE as to be less than 11
years old and have at least 10,000 tsubo of total floor space in
central wards of Tokyo,  Osaka  and Nagoya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
