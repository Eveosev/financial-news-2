Genworth Financial Inc. had its
credit rating confirmed at Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service
after announcing plans to distance the mortgage-guaranty unit
from the rest of the company.  Moody’s, which had been considering whether to downgrade
Genworth to junk status since June, said in a statement that
today’s action concludes the review of Richmond, Virginia-based
Genworth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
