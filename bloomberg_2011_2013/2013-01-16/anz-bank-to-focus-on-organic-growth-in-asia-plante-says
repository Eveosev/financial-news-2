Australia  & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd., the most Asia-focused of Australia’s four largest
lenders, said it will seek to expand existing operations in the
region instead of targeting new acquisitions.  “On an organic basis, there are plenty of opportunities
for us to grow,” Gilles Plante, the bank’s Asia-Pacific chief
executive officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television today. “So our path is to focus on organic
opportunities.”  ANZ Bank will selectively add staff in Asia in businesses
such as trade finance and foreign exchange where it sees growth,
he said.  The nation’s third-largest bank by market value is seeking
to earn as much as 30 percent of profit from outside Australia
and  New Zealand  by 2017. It agreed in 2009 to pay about $550
million for Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s units in six
Asian countries and is courting savings and demand for credit in
the region as loan growth at home slows.  Tighter  capital requirements  for banks are restricting
funds available for acquisitions of minority stakes in other
lenders. While under so-called Basel III rules banks are allowed
a 10 percent allowance for minority investments in other
financial institutions, the Australian Prudential Regulatory
Authority has proposed to disallow the concession.  ANZ  shares  closed 0.4 percent higher at A$25.36 in Sydney,
compared with a 0.5 percent gain for the benchmark S&P/ASX 200
Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
