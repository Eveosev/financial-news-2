The Czech government approved a
series of measures to cut budget spending and raise revenue
totaling 8.6 billion koruna ($446 million) in 2014.  The program, endorsed at a weekly meeting in  Prague  today,
will streamline operations of ministries and includes sales of
redundant property, the government said in an e-mailed
statement.  The plan is a part of Prime Minister Petr Necas’s effort to
cut the public-finance  gap  as the Cabinet seeks to bring the
shortfall to less than the European Union limit of 3 percent of
economic output in 2013. The ceiling for this year’s central-
budget deficit is 100 billion koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
