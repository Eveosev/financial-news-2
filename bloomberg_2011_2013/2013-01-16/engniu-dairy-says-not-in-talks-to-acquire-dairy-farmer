(Corrects third paragraph to show discussions took place
that didn’t yield progress.)  China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) , the
country’s largest milk-products producer, said it isn’t holding
talks to buy an unidentified dairy-farming company, two days
after a top executive said it had held discussions with  China
Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117)   “The company would like to clarify that there has not been
any negotiation between the board and the alleged target
company,” Mengniu said in a filing to  Hong Kong ’s stock
exchange yesterday.  There were discussions, and there wasn’t much progress,
Frank Ning, chairman of Mengniu, said on Jan. 14 in Hong Kong.  Buying Modern Dairy would give Mengniu more control over
its milk supply as concerns about safety in the nation’s dairy
industry linger. Hohhot, Inner Mongolia-based Mengniu blamed
moldy feed given to cows for excessive toxins found in milk at
one of the company’s warehouses in 2011.  The two companies had held discussions on a possible
acquisition, Bloomberg reported in August, citing two people
with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. Maanshan-based Modern Dairy
supplies Mengniu with unpasteurized milk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
