China  will add 18 percent more coal-
transporting rail capacity this year than initially forecast,
piling downward pressure on the price of the fuel, according to
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  The world’s top producer and consumer of coal will
commission 2,950 kilometers (1,833 miles) of such rail lines
after startup delays in 2012, caused by funding pullback
following a fatal high-speed train crash in 2011, Bernstein said
in an e-mailed note today. The broker had forecast 2,498
kilometers, according to the report.  Benchmark  spot prices  in China fell 20 percent last year as
an economic slowdown damped demand for the power-station fuel,
according to data from China Coal Transport and Distribution
Association. Costs will decline 7 percent this year and continue
to slide through 2015, Bernstein said in a report Jan. 14  “As delayed projects are commissioned in 2013, paths to
market will expand and pressure on coal price will persist,”
Michael Parker, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Bernstein, said in
the report. “Rail capacity growth is a core aspect of our
bearishness on the Chinese coal sector.”  The next track to be commissioned is a 98-kilometer link
from north Chongqing to Fuling, expected to start operations in
June, Bernstein said. Another 8,016 kilometers of railway will
come online over the following 18 months, with new lines opening
once every two to three months, it said.  Coal-dedicated lines commissioned last year totaled 179
kilometers, down 88 percent from 2011, according to Bernstein.  Seven major rail projects that link to ports in the
northeastern Bohai Bay will be completed by 2015, with the
Handan-Huanghua line to be finished this year, Bernstein said.  China’s power demand rose 5.5 percent to 4.96 trillion
kilowatt-hours in 2012, after an 11.7 percent increase in 2011,
the National Energy Administration said on Jan. 14.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
