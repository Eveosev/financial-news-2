Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said his
country should be more open to investment by foreigners after
labor leaders criticized McDonald’s Corp. for its expansion
plans in Italy.  “In recent weeks we have seen a rebirth of arguments
against multinationals that invest in Italy,” Monti said today
at a conference in Rome. “In my opinion you have to look at
these investments with more openness. Foreign multinationals
don’t just offer low-quality jobs. They don’t in and of
themselves remove opportunities from the territory, and I don’t
believe that by nature they bring worse working conditions.”  Monti didn’t cite McDonald’s or other companies, and didn’t
comment to reporters after his speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
