SLM Corp. (SLM) , the student lender known
as Sallie Mae, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $348 million
as originations climbed.  Net income fell to 74 cents per share, for the three months
ended Dec. 31, from $511 million, or 99 cents, in the year-
earlier period, the Newark, Delaware-based company said today in
a statement distributed by  Business Wire . Excluding items such
as the market gains and losses of derivatives contracts, SLMâ€™s
core earnings were $257 million, or 55 cents a share, the
company said. That compared with an average  estimate  of 53 cents
by eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  SLM is boosting private loan originations after legislation
passed in 2010 cut companies out of the market for government-
guaranteed lending.  Sallie Mae  made $514 million in education
loans in the fourth quarter, a 12.5 percent increase from the
year-ago period, according to the statement. The lender is
forecasting at least $4 billion of originations in 2013.  The charge-off rate, or the percentage of loans that has
been written off, rose to 4.2 percent from 3.5 percent, the
company said. The proportion of payments more than 90 days late
fell to 4.6 percent from 4.9 percent a year ago.  Originations are rising as education  debt  balloons. Rising
higher-education costs have swelled the outstanding amount of
U.S. student loans to $1 trillion. More than one in 10 borrowers
defaulted on their federal loans in the first three years they
are required to make payments, the Education Department said in
a Sept. 28 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
