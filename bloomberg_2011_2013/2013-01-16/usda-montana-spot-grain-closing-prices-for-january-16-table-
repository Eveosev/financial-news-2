     January 16 (Bloomberg)  -- This table displays the latest daily
spot or bid prices for durum wheat.  Prices are in dollars a bushel
Information is supplied by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Prices are determined by a USDA survey of grain purchasers
with elevators located in seven regions of  Montana . Prices are
displayed as a "low-high" range, or as a "single" price 
depending upon the degree of consensus among the purchasers.  Durum wheat is the hardest wheat. The test weight is at least 
60 pounds a bushel. Durum averages 15 percent protein and is 
mainly used in the making of pasta.
