Qatar National Bank SAQ (QNBK) , the  Middle
East ’s biggest bank by assets, expects to increase profit by 10
percent this year on increased lending as economic growth in the
emirate accelerates.  This growth excludes the purchase of a majority stake in
Egypt’s  National Societe Generale Bank (NSGB)  which should be completed
within two months, Chief Financial Officer Ramzi Mari said on a
conference call today. “We still have a lot of room to grow
even after the Egyptian market consolidation,” he said. “We
believe business in 2013 and 2014 will be as strong as 2012.”  The government revised its 2012 nominal GDP growth, which
reflects the cost of oil, to 14.7 percent from 11.2 percent
amid higher-than-forecast crude prices. Qatar, which is hosting
the 2022 soccer  World Cup , plans to spend $138 billion on
infrastructure from 2011 to 2016, greater than 10 percent of GDP
through 2016, the government also said in December.  The bank’s funding costs may also decline by 25 to 30 basis
points, said Mari. Qatar National Bank raised the dividend to 60
percent of its share value last year after reporting an 11
percent rise in profit. The payout in 2012 was an “exception,”
said Mari.  “Historically, QNB pays not more than 40 percent,” he
said. “The strategy talks about 40 percent. The board fully
understands that strategy.”  QNB is purchasing a 75 percent stake in National Societe
Generale amid a depreciation in the Egyptian pound, which has
fallen 6.7 percent in the past month. The depreciation won’t
affect the lender’s profitability and QNB has no plans to
withdraw from the deal, Mari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
