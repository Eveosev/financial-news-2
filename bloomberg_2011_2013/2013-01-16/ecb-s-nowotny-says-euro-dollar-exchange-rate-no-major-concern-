Council member Ewald Nowotny said the current exchange rate of
the euro against the dollar is not a concern for him and he
doesn’t expect the currency to keep appreciating in the longer
term.  “One shouldn’t overvalue short-term fluctuations of
exchange rates,” Nowotny told journalists on the sidelines of a
Euromoney conference in Vienna today. “I don’t see a
perspective of a longer-term trend, therefore it is from my
point of view not a matter of major concern.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
