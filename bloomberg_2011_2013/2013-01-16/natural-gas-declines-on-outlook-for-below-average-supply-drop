Natural gas futures slipped in  New
York  for the first time in five days before a government report
tomorrow that may show a below-average inventory decline.  Gas fell 0.6 percent as  U.S. stockpiles  may have decreased
by 137 billion cubic feet last week, based on the median of 18
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average
drop for the week is 144 billion, government data show. Above-
normal eastern U.S. temperatures this week will give way to
widespread cold, according to MDA Weather Services.  “We are not pulling a significant amount of gas from
storage on a sustained basis,” said Tom Saal, senior vice
president of energy trading at FCStone Latin America, LLC in
Miami. “We are probably going to get some colder weather but it
could be too little, too late. There’s plenty of gas in
inventory.”  Natural gas for February delivery fell 2 cents to settle at
$3.435 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices yesterday closed at $3.455, the
highest settlement since Dec. 28. Trading volume was 4.6 percent
above the 100-day average. Gas has climbed 29 percent from a
year ago.  Futures tumbled to $3.05 per million Btu on Jan. 2, the
lowest intraday price since Sept. 26. Prices are down 13 percent
from a one-year intraday high of $3.933 on Nov. 23.  February $3.40 puts were the most active gas options in
electronic trading. They were 0.2 cent lower at 6.5 cents on
volume of 2,221 contracts as of 4:09 p.m. Puts accounted for 53
percent of options volume.  Gas for March delivery traded 0.2 cent above the February
contract.  Gas Surplus  The weekly stockpile report from the Energy Information
Administration, an arm of the Energy Department, is due at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington . Last week’s report showed that inventories
fell 201 billion cubic feet in the seven days ended Jan. 4 to
3.316 trillion cubic feet, the biggest weekly decline since
February 2011.  A  surplus  to the five-year average fell to 10.7 percent
from 12.4 percent the previous week. Supplies were 2.6 percent
below year-earlier inventories, the widest deficit since
September 2011.  The low in New York on Jan. 19 may be 34 degrees Fahrenheit
(1 Celsius), 7 higher than usual, according to  AccuWeather Inc .
in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The low in  Cleveland  may be 27
degrees, 4 above normal.  About 50 percent of U.S. households use gas for heating,
EIA data show.  Warmest Year  Last year was the warmest in records going back to 1895 for
the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the second-worst for weather
extremes including drought, hurricanes and wildfires, according
to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Gas output in the lower-48 states rose to an all-time high
in October as more of the fuel was pumped from shale formations
in the Northeast and  North Dakota , the EIA said Jan. 7.  Gross gas production increased 0.4 percent to 73.54 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 73.22 billion in September, the
administration said in the monthly  EIA-914 report .  Supplies from the “other states” category rose 1.8
percent to 23.94 billion cubic feet a day from a revised 23.51
billion in September. Production advanced “as operators
reported new wells coming online in the Marcellus and Bakken
shale plays,” the agency said.  Production Record  Output rose to an all-time high of 28.5 trillion cubic feet
in 2011, led by record yields from shale deposits, the EIA said
in a separate report Jan. 7. Shale accounted for 30 percent of
total production in 2011, up from 22 percent the previous year.  U.S. marketed gas production in 2013 will average a record
69.84 billion cubic feet a day, up 0.4 percent from 69.59
billion estimated in December, the administration said Jan. 8 in
its monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook . Supplies may climb 0.9
percent from last year, the EIA said.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first nine months of last year, government
data show. If the trend goes on through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
