SunPower Corp. (SPWR) , the solar company
majority-owned by  Total SA (FP) , has installed 7.5 megawatts of
photovoltaic panels at a water-treatment plant in Phoenix that
will save the city at least $4 million over 20 years.  Under terms of the agreement, Wells Fargo & Co. owns the
system at the Lake Pleasant Water Treatment Plant that SunPower
designed, built and will operate. Phoenix will pay power rates
“competitive with retail electricity,” San Jose, California-
based SunPower said in a statement.  The almost 23,000 panels will provide about 70 percent of
the water treatment plant’s power, saving 15 million kilowatt-
hours annually. Phoenix already uses a 5.4-megawatt SunPower
solar array at Sky Harbor International Airport and smaller
systems throughout the city.  “The Lake Pleasant Water Treatment Plant project is the
latest in a series of solar initiatives utilized at various city
locations to increase the city’s commitment to sustainable
energy development,” Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton said in the
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
