European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said financial markets in the euro
area are beginning to function properly again.  “The ECB has been successful in easing market tensions
using standard and non-standard tools,” Coeure said in a speech
in Luxembourg today. Still, market re-integration “will succeed
only if it is supported by continued efforts by governments to
bridge fiscal and competitiveness imbalances.”  Since the Frankfurt-based ECB pledged last year to buy
 government bonds  if countries sign up to reform programs,
confidence in the single currency has returned. ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said last week that while financial market
fragmentation is being repaired, it may take time for the euro-
area economy to recover from a three-year debt crisis that’s
seen at least five of its 17 countries request bailouts.  “The underlying structural problems which relate to
uncertainty about risk, whether in the form of counterparty,
credit, liquidity or redenomination risk, need to be solved,”
Coeure said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
