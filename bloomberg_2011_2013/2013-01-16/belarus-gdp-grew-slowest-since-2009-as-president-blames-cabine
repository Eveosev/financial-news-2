Belarus’s economic growth fell short
of the government’s target last year, the statistics committee
 said  a day after President Aleksandr Lukashenko sought to pin
responsibility for miscalculating goals on cabinet members.  Gross domestic product expanded 1.5 percent from a year
earlier, down from 5.3 percent in 2011 and the weakest since
2009, the state committee in the capital, Minsk, said on its
website today. The government had targeted growth at 5 percent
to 5.5 percent last year.  “Believe me, it wasn’t me who set targets for the year,
but these gentlemen with the signed documents, which will be
stored in archives for a long time -- they suggested this
plan,” Lukashenko told reporters yesterday.  Belarus has used its close economic ties with  Russia  to
secure financial aid over the past two years as it grappled with
fallout from the 2011 balance-of-payments crisis. A Russian-led
$3 billion bailout helped the nation emerge from the downturn,
with the government also ceding ownership of its gas-pipeline
network to OAO Gazprom for $2.5 billion. The  International
Monetary Fund  has called the former Soviet republic’s economic
targets “inconsistent with stability.”  Belarusian inflation, which soared to 108.7 percent in
2011, slowed to 21.8 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
