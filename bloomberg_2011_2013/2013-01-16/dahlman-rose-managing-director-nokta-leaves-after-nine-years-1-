Omar Nokta , a managing director at
Dahlman Rose & Co. who covered marine transportation, left the
investment bank yesterday after nine years.  Nokta probably will seek a job with a shipping company,
 Bill Herbert , director of research at New York-based Dahlman
Rose, said by phone today. Sam Margolin, a vice president who
follows the refining industry and a former research associate
with Nokta, is adding marine transportation to his duties,
according to Herbert.  “He wanted to do something new, and his most likely
outcome will be going into the industry,” Herbert said of
Nokta. “That seems to be a trend these days of investment
professionals.”  Nokta’s recommendations on 34 maritime stocks from
Frontline Ltd. to  DryShips Inc. (DRYS)  returned 0.8 percent over the
past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. He followed
companies that own vessels hauling commodities from  iron ore  to
liquefied natural gas.  Dahlman Rose ranks 231st among 1,143 advisers for equity
issues, with 17 transactions in the last year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The bank helped to underwrite a sale of
Textainer Group Holdings Ltd. shares in September, according to
the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
