JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s losses from a
wrong-way bet on credit derivatives are close to being a “non-
issue” for the company, Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon 
said.  “We’re getting near the end of it,” Dimon said today on a
conference call with journalists. The bank racked up losses of
more than $6.2 billion in the first nine months of 2012.
JPMorgan has stopped disclosing the precise impact of the
position, saying it had a “modest” loss in the fourth quarter.  Dimon said the bank won’t disclose future losses because
they’re not material.  To contact the reporter on this story:
