Gulf Coast crude oils strengthened
on the  spot market  after inventories in the region reached the
lowest level in a year.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to domestic benchmark West
Texas Intermediate widened 20 cents in Cushing to $16.55 a
barrel at 2:01 p.m.  New York  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained 15 cents to $16.45 above
WTI.  Stockpiles of crude oil in the Gulf Coast PADD 3 region
 dropped 3.81 million barrels  last week to 158.8 million, the
Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration said in
its weekly report. The decline was the fifth in a row.  Sour Gulf crude grades also strengthened. Mars Blend gained
30 cents to a $12.55 premium, while Southern Green Canyon gained
25 cents to $12.40 above WTI. Thunder House slipped 45 cents to
a $14.80 premium.  The discount of West Texas Intermediate to Brent narrowed
to $16.44 a barrel at 1:20 p.m. in New York after reaching
$16.10 earlier, the  smallest gap since September . The discount
narrowed after  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) 
resumed service on the 500-mile (805-kilometer) Seaway line to
Houston from Cushing,  Oklahoma , at its increased capacity of
400,000 barrels a day last week.  “We’ve got Seaway flowing, and I think you’ve got the
market positioned for further weakness in the spread,”  Stephen Schork , the president of Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said by phone.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note this week that the
Seaway expansion could narrow the Brent-WTI spread to $6 in the
second quarter.  Seaway increased flows to 295,000 barrels a day yesterday,
said Hillary Stevenson, a Louisville, Kentucky-based data
integrity analyst for Genscape Inc., which monitors electrical
output at pumping stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
