Pakistan  stocks rallied from the
biggest plunge in the benchmark index in 17 months as some
investors judged the losses excessive.  The benchmark  Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index (KSE100)  advanced 0.5
percent to 16,181.47 at the close. The gauge plunged 3.2 percent
yesterday, the steepest slide since August 2011, after the
nation’s Supreme Court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja
Parvez Ashraf on charges of alleged corruption in a case
involving power projects.  Lotte Pakistan PTA Ltd. (LOTPTA) , part of South Korea’s Lotte Group,
rallied 4.9 percent to 6.60 rupees. The stock sank 9.2 percent
yesterday.  Oil & Gas Development Co. (OGDC) , Pakistan’s biggest company
by market value, rose 0.9 percent to 185.55 rupees, paring
yesterday’s 2.7 percent slide. TRG Pakistan, which manages call
centers in the country’s three biggest cities, surged 6.1
percent to 6.27 rupees.  “Investors see a landscape that is starved of investment
and I think people are hungry to get back into the game,”
Muddassar Malik, chief executive officer of BMA Funds, who
oversees the equivalent of $120 million in stocks and bonds,
said in an interview. “Our index target for the calendar year
2013 is 20,000, and we don’t feel that the current set of events
will derail that target for the time being.”  Yesterday’s court ruling came hours after Islamic scholar
Tahir-ul-Qadri had gathered thousands of people in the center of
Islamabad, vowing to stay put until the government quit and
corrupt politicians were removed from the legislature.  Pakistan ’s top judges ruled that the National
Accountability Bureau should arrange warrants for the arrest of
Ashraf and 15 others accused over the handling of contracts for
rented power units, according to the court order. The bureau’s
chairman has been ordered to report to the court Jan. 17.
Ashraf, who hasn’t been convicted of any crime, didn’t respond
to the court order.  To contact the reporters on this story:
