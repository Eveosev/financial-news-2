German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that security in northern  Africa  is also Europe’s security after
her government offered two transport aircraft to assist the
military operation combating insurgents in Mali.  The two Transall transport planes will fly African troops
from the Economic Community of West African States to the Malian
capital Bamako as French ground forces start operations to repel
insurgents controlling northern Mali, Merkel told reporters
today in Berlin.  “ Germany  views security in the region also as a part of
its own security,” Merkel said after meeting with Ivory Coast
President  Alassane Ouattara , chairman of Ecowas. “Terrorism in
Mali, or northern Mali, isn’t only a threat for Africa, but also
a threat for Europe.”  As French formations moved north from Bamako toward rebel-
held territory, Ouattara said there was a risk that the
insurgents might move out of  Mali  and threaten the rest of the
region. He called for humanitarian assistance and democratic
elections in Mali by July at the latest.  “We need a legitimate, recognized government that’s
elected by the Malian people in order to bring order and
territorial integrity to Mali,” Ouattara said.  The Transall aircraft don’t comprise a mission that would
require a parliamentary mandate, German Defense Minister Thomas de Maiziere said earlier. Should an expanded operation require a
mandate, the government may seek it, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
