U.S. Senator  John McCain  said in an
interview that the economic situation in  Egypt  is “very
serious” and he hopes the government can conclude a loan
agreement with the  International Monetary Fund  “as soon as
possible.”  McCain, speaking earlier at a press conference in Cairo,
said that in the aftermath of the uprising against  Hosni Mubarak 
the U.S. and Egypt had a chance to build “a truly strategic
partnership.” The ability of the U.S. to maintain economic aid
to Egypt “depends on the progress of democracy” in the
country, he said.  The delegation of U.S. senators also expressed to President
Mohamed Mursi their hopes for a resolution of a trial of non-
government organization workers and their “serious concerns”
about Sinai and the need for the Egyptian authorities to do more
to improve security there, he told reporters. They also raised
the issue of comments Mursi made several years ago that have
raised controversy in recent days.  Mursi said today his reported remarks in 2010 about Jews
were taken out of context of comments about Israeli actions
directed at Palestinians in Gaza, the state-run Ahram Gate
reported after his meeting with the delegation.  Mursi said he respects all religions and their followers,
and there is a difference between Judaism and those who adhere
to the faith and Israeli aggression against Palestinians, the
website quoted his spokesman, Yasser Ali, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
