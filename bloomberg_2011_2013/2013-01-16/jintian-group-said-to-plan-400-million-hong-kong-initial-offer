Jintian Group , a Chinese
pharmaceutical distributor, may seek about $400 million in an
initial public offering in Hong Kong, according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  The company, based in Heilongjiang province, plans to start
the offering next year, said the people, asking not to be
identified because the information is private. Jintian is
selecting investment banks to arrange the sale, they said.  Jintian operates drug stores across the northeast Chinese
province that borders  Russia . Two calls to the company’s office
in Jiamusi city seeking comment went unanswered.  Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., the country’s second-
largest drug distributor, raised $2.1 billion in Hong Kong in
May 2011. It was the biggest first-time share sale by a Chinese
pharmaceutical company in the city, Bloomberg data show. The
company has fallen 30 percent from its offer price.  Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co., which raised
$516 million in October, has lost 1.4 percent from its offer
price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
