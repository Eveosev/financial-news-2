Oil traded near the lowest level in
almost a week in New York after U.S. crude stockpiles increased
and the World Bank cut its economic growth forecasts.  Futures were little changed after slipping the most in
almost a month yesterday. U.S. crude supplies gained a second
week and inventories rose to a record at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for West Texas Intermediate, data from the
industry-funded American Petroleum Institute showed. An Energy
Department report today may show stockpiles climbed by 2.2
million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey. OPEC
reduced its output to the lowest level in 14 months, a monthly
report from the producer group showed.  “Supply in the U.S. is increasingly comfortable as their
domestic production of oil and gas burgeons,” said  Christopher Bellew , a senior broker at Jefferies Bache Ltd. in  London .  Crude for February delivery was at $93.34 a barrel, up 6
cents, in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
at 1:39 p.m. London time. The contract declined 0.9 percent to
$93.28 yesterday, the biggest drop since Dec. 21 and the lowest
close since Jan. 9.  Brent for February settlement, which expires today, was 11
cents higher at $110.41 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The more active March contract rose 14 cents to
$109.77. The front-month European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $17.12 to WTI. It closed at $17.02 yesterday, the
narrowest spread since Sept. 19.  Cushing Supplies  The North Sea Brent pipeline system remained shut after an
oil leak was discovered on Jan. 14 at a platform connecting to
the field, according to an official from Abu Dhabi National
Energy Company PJSC, known as Taqa, which operates the network.  Total U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 46,000 barrels last
week, according to the API. Supplies at Cushing increased 1.8
million barrels, a sixth weekly gain, to a record 51.8 million.  WTI dropped 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened the glut at Cushing, America’s largest storage hub.
That left it at an average discount of $17.47 a barrel to Brent
last year, compared with a premium of about 7 cents in the five
years through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than
half the world’s crude, climbed 3.5 percent last year.  U.S. gasoline supplies rose by 4.1 million barrels, the API
said. They are projected to gain by  2.7 million  in today’s
Energy Department report, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in the Bloomberg survey. Distillate inventories, a
category that includes heating oil and diesel, fell 568,000
barrels, the API said. An increase of 1.5 million was forecast
for the government report.  OPEC Cuts  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut
output by 465,000 barrels a day in December to 30.4 million, the
lowest level since October 2011, led by a reduction in Saudi
Arabia, the group said today in its monthly report, citing
secondary sources. That’s 800,000 barrels a day more than the
average 29.6 million that the group estimates it will need to
supply this year. OPEC kept its 2013 global demand forecast
unchanged.  WTI may extend losses as a measure of technical momentum
declines. On the daily chart, the moving average convergence-
divergence indicator has fallen to the smallest premium to its
signal line in a month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors typically sell contracts when the MACD drops below the
signal line, known as a bearish crossover.  The Washington-based World Bank cut its projection for
economic growth in the U.S., the biggest crude consumer, by 0.5
percentage point to 1.9 percent in its twice-yearly report
yesterday.  The bank reduced its forecast for  Japan , the world’s third-
largest crude user, to 0.8 percent from 1.5 percent, predicted a
second year of contraction in the euro region and lowered its
estimates for  emerging markets  led by  Brazil ,  India  and  Mexico .
It cut the growth estimate for  China , the second-biggest oil
consumer, to 8.4 percent from 8.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
