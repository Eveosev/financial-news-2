Azerbaijan’s economic growth
accelerated in 2012 as a surge in non-energy industries overcame
a decline in oil production.  The Caspian Sea nation’s gross domestic product expanded
2.2 percent last year, compared with 0.1 percent a year earlier,
President Ilham Aliyev told a Cabinet meeting broadcast late
yesterday on state television channel AzTV. The non-oil economy
grew 9.7 percent, he said.  Crude output in the third-largest oil producer in the
former Soviet Union fell 3.7 percent to 43.9 million metric tons
in 2012, Rovnaq Abdullayev, president of State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, or Socar, said on Dec. 30. Natural gas production
rose 8.3 percent to 27.9 billion cubic meters, he said.  Information and technology services expanded 15.9 percent
in 2012, Economic Development Minister Sahin Mustafayev told the
Cabinet meeting.  Inflation slowed to 1.1 percent last year from 7.9 percent
the year before, Mustafayev said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
