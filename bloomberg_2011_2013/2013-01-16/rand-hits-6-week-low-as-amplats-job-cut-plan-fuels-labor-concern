The rand retreated to its lowest
against the dollar in more than six weeks on concern plans made
by  South Africa ’s largest platinum producer to idle shafts and
cut jobs could trigger further labor unrest in the country.  The rand depreciated as much as 0.6 percent and traded 0.4
percent lower at 8.8547 per dollar as of 8:43 a.m. in
Johannesburg, the weakest level since Dec. 4 and the worst
performer of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on
benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026 were unchanged at
7.13 percent.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  will shut four shafts, cutting
output by 400,000 ounces and putting 14,000 jobs at risk, it
said yesterday. Metals and other minerals accounted for 61
percent of South Africa’s exports in the first 11 months of
2012, according to government data. The trade deficit in the
same period was 112.7 billion rand ($13 billion), more than six
times bigger than a year earlier, as a wave of strikes in the
mining and transport industries intensified.  “The risk is that this now escalates into another round of
major labor unrest,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a Johannesburg-based
analyst at ETM Analytics, and colleagues wrote in e-mailed
comments. “The impact of the unrest was clearly evident in the
trade data in 2012 and this latest news is also likely to affect
the trade account which remains under considerable pressure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
