The International Monetary Fund
agreed to disburse 3.2 billion euros ($4.3 billion) to  Greece 
after the country made new budget cuts, received more favorable
aid terms from European nations and conducted a bond buyback.  The IMF board made the decision during a meeting today, it
said in a press statement. The funds are part of a joint 130
billion-euro package with European nations, which unblocked
their share last month.  “The situation on the Greek front is improving,” Thomas Costerg, an economist at Standard Chartered in  London , said in
an e-mail. “This said, the situation remains fragile, and
despite the buyback Greece’s huge debt is still an issue.”  The loan had been frozen since June as a recession and
domestic opposition to the program drove Greece away from
measures agreed to just three months earlier.  While European policy makers now turn their attention to
reviving growth in the 17-country monetary zone and to bailing
out Cyprus, Greece may yet again creep back on their agenda. The
government has to deliver on its commitments to earn each future
payout and European finance ministers committed to “additional
measures” if the country’s debt reduction veers off track.  To contact the reporter on this story:
