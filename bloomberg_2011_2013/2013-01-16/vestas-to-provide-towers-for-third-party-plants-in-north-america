Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the biggest
wind-turbine maker, agreed to provide towers for power projects
in  North America  that use other companies’ systems.  Vestas will begin producing the towers soon at its plant in
Pueblo,  Colorado , and the deal will create more than 100 jobs by
the end of this quarter, the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said
today in a statement. It said it will supply a number of non-
Vestas projects, without naming the customers.  The deal is a second lifeline this year to Vestas factory
workers in the U.S. after the  House of Representatives  on Jan. 1
passed a bill extending subsidies to wind projects. It’s also
the first time Vestas has sold towers in North America to
projects not using its turbines, part of a new strategy to
become more flexible at a time when shipments are declining.  “Vestas is continuously evaluating its manufacturing
footprint and opportunities to utilise the current production
capacity better,” Chief Operating Officer Jean-Marc Lechene
said in the statement. “Producing components for third parties
is part of this strategy, and although we have had other smaller
orders, this new agreement is the first major step.”  Vestas sees global shipments totaling 5 gigawatts in 2013,
from about 6.3 gigawatts last year. Today’s supply agreement may
use up 25 percent of capacity at the Pueblo plant, Vestas said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
