China’s stocks  fell, led by property
developers and brokerages, as valuations at a seven-month high
raised concern a six-week share rally was excessive.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. and  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  lost at least
2.9 percent on speculation the government will introduce real-
estate taxes nationwide. Citic Securities Co., which has jumped
34 percent since Dec. 3, fell 1.7 percent to lead brokerages
lower. Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. retreated the most in
three weeks after canceling a policy punishing retailers for
cutting prices. A government report showed  China ’s  foreign
direct investment  slid 4.5 percent in December.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.7 percent to 2,309.50
at the close. The index traded at 12.8 times reported earnings
yesterday, the highest since May, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. It has risen 18 percent from an almost four-year low
on Dec. 3 on speculation economic growth is picking up.  “There’s no major negative news and it’s just some profit-
taking,” said Tang Yonggang, an analyst at Hongyuan Securities
Co. in Beijing. “Financial stocks were the first to advance in
the upcycle, so they are leading the decline now. We have
already gotten out of the long-term downward trend, so the fall
today is only temporary. People are used to taking profits
whenever they see some gains.”  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) , which entered a  bull market  earlier this
month with a 20 percent gain from the Dcember low, lost 0.7
percent to 2,577.09. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  slid 1.3 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, dropped 0.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday. Average trading volumes for the Shanghai index were
37 percent higher than the 30-day average. Thirty-day  volatility 
was at 21, compared with last year’s average of 17.1.  Property Tax  A gauge of  property stocks  in the Shanghai index slid 2
percent, the most among the five industry groups. Poly Real
Estate, the second-biggest developer, lost 3.4 percent to 13.56
yuan. Gemdale slumped 2.9 percent to 6.80 yuan. The property
measure is the biggest gainer among the groups over the past
year, surging 37 percent.  China should “gradually” establish a property taxation
system that covers trading and ownership, Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said yesterday. Many Chinese cities are preparing to introduce
property tax trials, the China Securities Journal reported on
Nov. 16, citing unidentified people.  “We still believe that the property tax is the policy most
likely to be launched in 2013,” Haitong Securities Co. analysts
wrote in a report today, referring to an expansion to the
property tax trials.  In its more than two-year effort to curb the  property
market , the government has imposed a property tax for the first
time in Shanghai and Chongqing, raised down-payment and mortgage
requirements, increased building of low-cost social housing and
placed home-purchase restrictions in about 40 cities.  FDI Drop  China’s  foreign direct investment  declined for the first
full year since 2009 as economic growth slowed and manufacturers
relocated to markets with cheaper labor, contrasting with
outbound spending that surged to a record.  Inbound FDI dropped 4.5 percent in December from a year
earlier to $11.7 billion, the 13th decline in 14 months,
according to Ministry of Commerce data. FDI inflows compare with
a 5.4 percent drop in November to $8.3 billion. For the full
year, inflows fell 3.7 percent to $111.7 billion, while China’s
non-financial investment abroad increased 28.6 percent to $77.2
billion.  “The FDI data didn’t have a big impact as stocks have
gained considerably so investors are taking profits now,” Zhang
Lei, an analyst with Minsheng Securities Co., said by phone from
Beijing. “This is only temporary, I don’t think our uptrend has
ended yet.”  Brokers Slide  Citic Securities, the biggest-listed brokerage, fell 1.7
percent to 13.40  yuan . Haitong Securities dropped 2.1 percent to
10.06 yuan. Haitong has jumped 27 percent since Dec. 3.
Brokerages have rallied on speculation the stock rally may
increase earnings and the government will boost the amount of
money foreign investors can spend to buy domestic shares.  China Railway Group Ltd. (601390)  slid 2.7 percent to 3.29 yuan and
China Railway Construction Corp. fell 2.8 percent to 6.20 yuan.
The stocks had surged at least 29 percent in the past three
months through yesterday on speculation urban development will
boost spending on public transport.  Chinese rail and construction machinery stocks are
“yesterday’s heroes, and will not do well as China moves past
its great investment boom,” analysts Julian Bu and Zhi Aik Yeo
said in a Jan. 14 report.  Drugmakers Rise  Moutai declined 2.3 percent to 206 yuan, the most since
Dec. 24. The biggest maker of baijiu liquor canceled a policy
that penalized retailers which lowered prices with quota cuts,
spokeswoman Li Hongfang said by phone yesterday. The policy
didn’t comply with anti-trust laws, Li said.  A measure of  health-care companies  rose 1.2 percent, the
biggest gainer among 10 industry groups in the CSI 300. The sub-
index has rallied 8.6 percent this year, making it the best
performer. Shandong Donge-E E-Jiao Co., which makes traditional
Chinese medicine, rose 5.8 percent to 46.35 yuan. Kangmei
Pharmaceutical Co. surged 2.5 percent to 14.84 yuan.  “Health stocks are boosted by concerns about the H1N1
flu,” Minsheng’s Zhang said. A total of 360 cases of the flu
were reported between Dec. 1 and Jan. 6, including two deaths,
prompting health officials to issue a flu shot warning, the
 China Daily  reported today.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Shiyin Chen  To contact the reporter on this story:
