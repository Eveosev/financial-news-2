Yale University , the second-
wealthiest college, may increase its holdings of  hedge funds 
after cutting them last year and shifting into cash, according
to a  report  from the investments office run by  David Swensen .  Yale, whose $19.3 billion endowment is second in size only
to Harvard University’s, may boost hedge fund investments to 18
percent of its portfolio after cutting them to 14.5 percent in
the year that ended in June, according to the report posted to
the investments office website. The university also increased
its target for private equity and real estate holdings.  The new targets show New Haven, Connecticut-based Yale’s
appetite for buying hard-to-sell assets is growing again after
the investments contributed to the school’s record 24.6 percent
loss amid the global financial crisis in 2009. Swensen, who has
run Yale’s investment office since 1985, is credited with
crafting a model for universities to generate superior returns
by buying more of the so-called illiquid assets while cutting
holdings of bonds, publicly traded equities and cash.  Yale raised its target for private equity investments to 35
percent from 34 percent and real estate investments to 22
percent from 20 percent.  Tom Conroy , a spokesman for Yale, had no immediate comment
when contacted by e-mail.  Yale had 2.7 percent of its endowment in cash as of June
30, up from negative 1.1 percent the year prior, according to
the report. The university, which posted a 4.7 percent gain on
its endowment in the year ended June 30, has a target to have
nothing in cash, the report shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
