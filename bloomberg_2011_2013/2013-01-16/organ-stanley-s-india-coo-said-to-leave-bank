Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s chief operating
officer in  India , Nina Nagpal, has left the bank along with 13
other employees in the country, three people with knowledge of
the matter said.  Nagpal, who joined the New York-based bank in 1999, left
last week, the people said, asking not to be named because the
information is private. The other departing staff come from
Morgan Stanley’s investment banking, fixed income and research
departments in India, they said.  Noel Cheung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for the bank,
declined to comment on the departures.  Morgan Stanley, which has more than 400 staff in India,
plans to trim about 15 percent of investment banking positions
in  Asia  as it starts a round of job cuts this week, two people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. The investment bank
is also deferring bonuses for some senior bankers and traders
over three years, one person said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
