U.K. stocks  fell as the  World Bank 
predicted that the economy of the euro area will contract in
2013, while  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the strength of the single
currency threatened the region’s growth.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  dropped 3.1 percent as the  African
National Congress  said South Africa’s government should withdraw
the company’s platinum licenses.  Tesco Plc (TSCO)  slid 0.7 percent
after tests found horse DNA in its beef burgers. Vodafone Group
Plc slipped 1.8 percent after Deutsche Bank AG said the company
probably won’t buy back more shares.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  declined 13.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,103.98 at the close in London, paring an earlier slide of as
much as 0.7 percent. The  equity benchmark  rose to its highest
level since May 2008 last week amid optimism that U.S.
companies’ earnings would exceed analysts’ estimates. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index also fell 0.2 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.3 percent.  “Hopefully, the rehabilitation in Europe is sustained,
albeit you are already beginning to price a lot of the recovery
in,” said  Derek Mitchell , a U.K. equity fund manager at Royal
London Asset Management Ltd., which manages about $74 billion.
“The market has come too far, too fast, valuations are very
stretched. Last year was all about a re-rating, but we need to
see earnings growth this year, and the U.S. is a good indication
of what we can expect later in the U.K. market.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE 100 companies
was 45 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price-earnings
ratio for the FTSE 100 peaked at 15.8 times trailing earnings on
Jan. 11, its highest level in two years.  World Bank  The  World Bank  forecast that the euro region will contract
for a second consecutive year in 2013. It also projected that
the global economy will expand 2.4 percent, slower than the 3
percent growth that it predicted last June.  Juncker, the leader of the group of finance ministers from
the euro area, said the currency’s 8 percent gain against the
 U.S. dollar  over the past six months posed a threat to the
economies of its 17 members. He described the euro’s value as
dangerously high. The currency traded above $1.34 against the
dollar this week for the first time since February last year.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government lowered the
forecast for its own economy. Gross domestic product growth will
slow to 0.4 percent this year from 0.7 percent in 2012, the
 Economy Ministry  said in its annual report.  Chinese FDI  In China,  foreign direct investment  declined for the first
full year since 2009 as economic growth slowed and manufacturers
relocated to markets with cheaper labor. Inbound FDI fell 3.7
percent to $111.7 billion. Inflows dropped 4.5 percent in
December from a year earlier to $11.7 billion, according to
Ministry of Commerce data released in Beijing today.  Anglo American dropped 3.1 percent to 1,901 pence. The ANC
said that the government should withdraw mining licenses from
the company’s Amplats unit. The business, also known as Anglo
American Platinum Ltd., said yesterday that it will idle four
shafts in South Africa, cutting production of the precious metal
by 400,000 ounces a year and firing as many as 14,000 workers.
Workers at three mines refused to go underground today,
according to a company spokeswoman.  Tesco slid 0.7 percent to 347.1 pence. The U.K.’s largest
retailer withdrew two types of beef burger after the Food Safety
Authority of Ireland found that some contained horse DNA.  Vodafone, Lloyds  Vodafone retreated 1.8 percent to 160 pence as Deutsche
Bank lowered its recommendation on the world’s second-largest
mobile-phone operator to hold from buy. The brokerage said
Vodafone’s growth rate will probably deteriorate this year and
its free  cash flow  may decline through 2014.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  slipped 2.5 percent to 53 pence and 1.1 percent to 350.1
pence, respectively, following European lenders lower.  Fortune Oil Plc (FTO)  rose 4.4 percent to 11.8 pence after saying
that more than two-thirds of its creditors granted it a formal
waiver, allowing China Gas Holdings Ltd. to buy its natural gas
business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
