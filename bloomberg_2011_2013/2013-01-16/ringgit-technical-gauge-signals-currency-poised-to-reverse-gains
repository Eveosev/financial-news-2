A technical gauge signals a recent
rally in  Malaysia ’s ringgit that drove the currency to a 10-
month high may end after the  World Bank  cut its growth forecast
for the global economy.  The 14-day relative strength index was at 31, near the 30
level that suggests the dollar is poised to rebound. The ringgit
traded at 3.0154 per dollar as of 10:19 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
little changed from 3.0160 yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. It climbed 1.4 percent this month, the second-best
performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-active currencies, and reached
3.0032 yesterday, the strongest level since March 9.  The World Bank lowered its estimate for global gross
domestic product to 2.4 percent for 2013, from a June forecast
of 3 percent, citing austerity measures, high unemployment and
low business confidence in developed nations. The ringgit has
appreciated 0.4 percent since official reports last week showed
exports and factory output beat economists’ predictions.  “The ringgit has gained quite a bit this year after the
better economic data and some selling is to be expected,” said
Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader in  Kuala Lumpur  at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “The World Bank’s report also added
some pressure.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, decreased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.02 percent.  Industrial output  in the Southeast Asian nation rose 7.5
percent in November, the most since May, and more than the 5.9
percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Overseas sales 
increased 3.3 percent, topping the 2.3 percent expected.  Government bonds  were little changed, with the yield on the
3.418 percent notes maturing in August 2022 at 3.49 percent,
according to prices from Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
