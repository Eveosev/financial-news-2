The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars fell from almost the highest versus the yen in more than
four years as the Japanese currency’s slide over the past three
months prompted criticism of excessive exchange-rate moves.  The South Pacific currencies weakened as Russia’s central
bank said the world’s leading economies are on the brink of a
“currency war” as policy makers advocate weaker currencies to
boost economic growth. The Aussie was little changed against its
U.S. counterpart as data showed  consumer confidence  was at
almost the lowest since October. New Zealand’s dollar gained
versus the dollar as commodities rose.  “The recent tempering of investor optimism has caused both
the Aussie and the kiwi to give back some of their recent
gains,”  Joe Manimbo , a market analyst at Western Union Business
Solutions, a unit of Western Union Co., wrote in an e-mail.
“Overall sentiment appears neutral, with their downside limited
by mounting evidence of a recovering  China , while U.S. fiscal
uncertainty caps the upside.”  Australia ’s dollar weakened 0.4 percent to 93.44 yen in  New
York  trading yesterday. It reached 94.66 yen on Jan. 15, the
strongest level since August 2008. The Aussie traded at $1.0572.  The kiwi, as the New Zealand dollar is called, depreciated
0.3 percent to 74.32 yen after touching 75.53 yen on Jan. 15,
the highest since September 2008. The currency strengthened 0.2
to 84.10 U.S. cents.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials increased
0.2 percent.  Yen’s Drop  The yen tumbled 12 percent over the past three months
against nine other developed-market peers tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes as Japanese officials moved to
boost inflation and spur economic growth. It was the biggest
loser in the group. The Australian dollar gained 2.8 percent,
and the kiwi climbed 3.3 percent.  “ Japan  is weakening the yen, and other countries may
follow,” Bank Rossii First Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev  said
at a conference in Moscow yesterday. Reciprocal devaluations
would hurt the global economy, Ulyukayev said.  Australia’s sentiment index for January rose 0.6 percent to
100.6, a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute showed
yesterday in Sydney. This month’s figure was little changed from
the 100.03 level in December that was the least since October.
