The Chicago Bears hired Marc Trestman of the Canadian Football League’s  Montreal  Alouettes as
coach to replace Lovie Smith.  Trestman, 57, returns to the National Football League after
compiling a 59-31 record in five seasons in Montreal and winning
Grey Cup championships in 2009 and 2010.  Trestman spent 17 years in the NFL as an assistant coach
and tutored quarterbacks such as Steve Young and Rich Gannon,
both of whom won NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Trestman was
voted the CFL’s coach of the year in 2009 and helped quarterback
Anthony Calvillo win league MVP awards in 2008 and 2009.  In moving to the NFL from  Canada , Trestman follows the path
of coaches such as Marv Levy and Bud Grant. Both led their NFL
teams to Super Bowl appearances after coaching in the CFL.  Trestman has been out of the NFL for eight years, having
been the offensive coordinator at North Carolina State in
2005-06 before going to the CFL in 2008.  The Bears fired Smith on Dec. 31 after a 10-6 season. Smith
had been coach since 2004, leading the team to a 81-63 record,
three division titles and a Super Bowl appearance after the 2006
season.  The Bears lost five of their final eight games this season
following a 7-1 start and their offense ranked 28th out of 32
teams in total yardage.  Trestman’s last NFL job was as quarterbacks coach and
assistant head coach of the Miami Dolphins in 2004. He
previously worked with the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco
49ers, Detroit Lions,  Arizona  Cardinals and Oakland Raiders,
helping all those teams reach the playoffs in his first season
as an assistant.  Trestman was offensive coordinator for the 49ers, Cardinals
and Raiders, and will now seek to improve a Chicago offense led
by quarterback Jay Cutler, a former first-round draft pick who
passed for 3,033 yards last season, with 19 touchdowns and 14
interceptions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
