Brazil ’s economic activity index
rose more than economists forecast in November, as the world’s
second-biggest emerging market continues an uneven recovery from
a slowdown lasting more than a year.  The seasonally adjusted  economic activity index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, rose 0.4 percent in November after
increasing a revised 0.4 percent in October, the central bank
said today in a report posted on its website. The number was
higher than predicted by all but 3 of 26 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for a 0.2 percent rise. The
non-seasonally adjusted index rose 2.76 percent from a year ago.  Since August 2011, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration has taken steps to buoy Brazil’s $2.5 trillion
economy, which is forecast to have grown last year at the
slowest pace since 2009. Stimulus measures including tax cuts,
record-low  interest rates  and plans to reduce energy costs have
not offset the effects of falling investments and flagging
business confidence. Still, policy makers are expected to keep
borrowing costs on hold at 7.25 percent today, as inflation
accelerates.  Some sectors of Brazil’s economy have been slow to respond
to government actions. Industrial production fell in November
for the second time in three months on a decline in capital
goods. Retail sales grew for the sixth consecutive month in
November, the pace of increase slowed for the first time since
August.  Consumer prices in December  increased  at the fastest pace
since March 2011 on higher personal expenses. Analysts expect
inflation in 2013 will remain above the midpoint of the 4.5
percent target for the fourth year in a row, according to the
latest central bank survey of about 100 economists.  The central bank last month cut its 2012 growth forecast to
1 percent, down from 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in
2010. Growth in the world’s sixth-largest economy will rebound
to 3 percent to 4 percent this year, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said on Dec. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
