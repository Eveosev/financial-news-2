Nordea Bank AB (NDA) , the Nordic region’s
largest lender, said it has appointed Torsten Hagen Joergensen
as its new chief financial officer to replace Fredrik Rystedt,
who will leave the lender after more than four years.  Joergensen’s new position will be effective immediately,
Stockholm-based Nordea said in a  statement  today. The bank also
appointed its head of Swedish banking operations, Hans Jacobson,
to country senior executive in  Sweden , it said.  Joergensen, 47, started his banking career in 1987 as a
macroeconomic and fixed income analyst at Denmark’s
Provinsbanken A/S. He also worked at Gudme Raaschou Bank A/S,
Nykredit Holding A/S, BG Bank A/S and  Danske bank A/S (DANSKE)  before
joining Nordea’s asset management and life business in 2005.
Joergensen was head of group strategy in 2007 before becoming
head of group treasury in 2009. He has been the head of group
operations and other lines of business at Nordea since 2009.  “Fredrik has been a competent and highly professional CFO
and contributed substantially in managing Nordea through the
European financial crisis,” the bank said in the statement.  Rystedt became Nordea’s CFO in September 2008, after having
had the same position at Swedish appliance maker  Electrolux AB. (ELUXB)   To contact the reporter on this story:
