Revenue earned by  Nigeria  increased
2 percent to 581 billion naira ($3.7 billion) in December from a
month earlier after oil exports rose, Accountant-General Jonah
Otunla said.  The sales volume of exports rose “even as crude-oil
production and lifting encountered several disruptions as a
result of increased bunkering activities and ongoing
maintenance” on pipelines and other facilities, he said in an
e-mailed statement today from Abuja, the capital. Revenue for
November was 569.5 billion naira, Otunla said. Oil export
figures weren’t given.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous nation
with more than 160 million people, relies on crude for 80
percent of government revenue and 95 percent of foreign-currency
earnings. The West African nation’s crude-oil savings account
balance stands at $9.2 billion, according to Otunla’s statement.  The total revenue shared by federal, state and local
governments in December was 567.7 billion naira, Otunla said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
