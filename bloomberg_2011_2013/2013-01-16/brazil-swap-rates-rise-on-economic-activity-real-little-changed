Brazilian swap rates rose for a
second day after a bigger-than-forecast boost in economic
activity bolstered wagers that the central bank will refrain
from cutting borrowing costs today.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 climbed
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.74 percent at
9:52 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real was little changed at 2.0374
per  U.S. dollar .  The seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a proxy
for gross domestic product, rose 0.4 percent in November, the
central bank reported today. The median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.2 percent increase.  “The indicator was a surprise in relation to the market’s
estimates,” Alfredo Barbutti, an economist at Liquidez DTVM in
Sao Paulo, said in a phone interview.  Policy makers have left the benchmark rate at a record low
7.25 percent since October. The central bank will hold borrowing
costs steady at its two-day meeting that ends today, according
to all of the 56 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
