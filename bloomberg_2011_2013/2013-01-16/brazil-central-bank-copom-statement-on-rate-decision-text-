Following is a translation of the
statement by  Brazil ’s central bank on its interest rate decision
today.  “The Copom decided unanimously to keep the Selic rate at
7.25 percent p.a., without a bias.  Considering the balance of risks for inflation, which
worsened in the short term, the recovery of domestic activity,
which was less intense than expected, as well as the complexity
that still surrounds the global environment, the committee
understands that the stability of monetary conditions for a
sufficiently prolonged period of time is the most adequate
strategy to guarantee the convergence of inflation to target.  Voting for this decision were the following board members:
President Alexandre Antonio Tombini, Aldo Luiz Mendes,  Altamir Lopes , Anthero de Moraes Meirelles, Carlos Hamilton Vasconcelos Araujo, Luiz Awazu Pereira da Silva, Luiz Edson Feltrim and
Sidnei Correa Marques.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
