recovery, boosting demand prospects.  Copper for delivery in three months increased as much as
0.3 percent to $8,021.25 a metric ton on the London Metal
Exchange, before trading at $8,003.75 at 1:48 p.m. in  Seoul . The
metal is 0.9 percent higher this year, extending a 4.4 percent
gain last year, on bets that economic recovery in  China , the
biggest buyer, will increase demand.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold advanced for a third day toward a two-week high as
expectations that global policy makers will need to stimulate
growth boosted demand for a store of value. Platinum was set for
the longest rally in four months.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.3 percent to $1,684.89 an
ounce and traded at $1,684.37 at 2:58 p.m. in Singapore. The
metal reached $1,685.25 yesterday, the costliest since Jan. 3,
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
previous day that while the U.S. economy is responding to
monetary stimulus there is still “quite a ways to go.”  Cash palladium climbed 0.7 percent to $715.45 an ounce,
rising for third day. The price touched a 10-month high of
$720.95 yesterday.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans advanced as dry weather may increase stress on
crops in  Brazil , set to overtake the U.S. as the world’s biggest
exporter, amid declining world supplies.Corn extended its
longest rally in a year.  Soybeans for March delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent
to $14.2375 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and were at

percent to $14.3625 yesterday, the highest level since Dec. 26.  Corn for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to $7.33 a
bushel. The most-active contract advanced for the seventh
session yesterday, the longest rally since Dec. 28, 2011. Wheat
for March delivery climbed 0.7 percent to $7.8825 a bushel.  Palm oil climbed for a third day on speculation that
stockpiles in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, may
drop from a record as output falls and demand recovers in India
and  Pakistan .  The contract for delivery in March, which had the largest
open interest, advanced as much as 1.3 percent to 2,428 ringgit
($806) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, and
was at 2,420 ringgit at 4:07 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur. That helped
trim losses to 0.7 percent this month.  Rubber slumped by the most in more than two months as the
Japanese currency advanced and crude oil traded near a one-week
low, cutting the appeal of the commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in June fell 2.6 percent to end at
304.1 yen a kilogram ($3,443 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. That’s the biggest drop at close since Nov.
5, paring this year’s advance to 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
