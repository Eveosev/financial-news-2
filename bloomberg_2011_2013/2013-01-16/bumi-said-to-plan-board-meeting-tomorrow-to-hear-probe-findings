Bumi Plc, the London-listed coal
venture founded by  Nathaniel Rothschild  and  Indonesia ’s Bakrie
family, will hold a board meeting tomorrow to discuss findings
of a probe into potential financial irregularities, a person
familiar with the plan said.  The board will be presented with the investigation that
London-based law firm Macfarlanes LLP started in September to
examine possibly unusual transactions at some of Bumi’s
Indonesian operations, the person said, asking not to identified
because the meeting hasn’t been announced publicly.  A summary of the report will be released within days, while
Macfarlanes will continue to probe some information uncovered in
the investigation so far, the person said.  The $3 billion deal in 2010 to create Bumi Plc brought
together Rothschild, scion of a centuries-old British banking
dynasty, and the Bakries, a family-owned palm-oil-to-property-
empire started in Sumatra in 1942. Board infighting and probes
in London and Indonesia have resulted in co-founders Rothschild
and Indra Bakrie quitting as directors and making separate
offers to unwind the transaction.  Managers at PT Bumi Resources, which is 29 percent owned by
 Bumi Plc (BUMI) , are criticized in the Macfarlanes report, the London-
based Times reported today, without saying where it got the
information. The report will clear Bumi Chairman Samin Tan of
any wrongdoing, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
