The Australian dollar fell for a
second day against the yen after data showed  consumer confidence 
was little changed from a two-month low, underscoring concern
the South Pacific nation’s economy is weakening.  The so-called Aussie slid versus most of its 16 major
counterparts after the World Bank cut its global growth forecast
for this year, tempering demand for higher-yielding assets.
Australia’s bonds advanced for a third day. The  New Zealand
dollar , known as the kiwi, dropped versus its Japanese peer as
Asian stocks declined.  “We’ve seen over the last week that domestic data hasn’t
been that good and the Aussie’s taken perhaps a slight hit,”
said Derek Mumford, a Sydney-based director at Rochford Capital,
a currency risk-management company. “I wouldn’t say today’s
data reflects any kind of booming confidence.”  Australia ’s dollar fell 1 percent to 92.86 yen as of 4:50
p.m. in Sydney. It lost 0.2 percent to $1.0549.  New Zealand ’s
currency bought 73.87 yen, 0.9 percent below the close in  New
York . It traded at 83.93 U.S. cents from 83.97 yesterday.  Ten-year yields in Australia dropped to as low as 3.36
percent, the lowest since Jan. 3. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of
shares lost 0.8 percent.  Australia’s sentiment index for January rose 0.6 percent to
100.6, a Westpac Banking Corp. and Melbourne Institute survey
taken Jan. 7-13 of 1,200 adults showed today in Sydney. This
month’s figure was little changed from the 100.03 level in
December that was the least since October. Readings above 100
indicate optimists outnumbered pessimists.  Slower Growth  The Washington-based  World Bank  projects the global economy
will expand 2.4 percent, down from a June forecast of 3 percent,
after growing 2.3 percent in 2012. It halved its forecast for
 Japan , cut the U.S. projection by 0.5 percentage point and
predicted a second year of contraction in the euro region.  Expected price swings in the Aussie are increasing after
dropping to a 16-year low in December. Implied one-month
volatility on the Aussie climbed to 7.03 percent yesterday, the
most since Nov. 19. Higher volatility means the price of an
asset may vary dramatically in a short period, increasing the
potential for losses.  “Even though the Aussie is relatively strong in the near
term, I think the risks are to the downside,” Rochford
Capital’s Mumford said.  Forecasts Raised  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s largest
lender, raised its forecasts for the Aussie and kiwi, citing “a
firming global economy and softer  U.S. dollar ” in a report
today by analysts led by Chief Currency Strategist Richard Grace
in Sydney.  The Australian dollar will rise to $1.07 by mid-year and
will be at $1.08 by Dec. 31, up from an earlier estimate of
$1.04 for both time periods. Its New Zealand counterpart will
climb to 87 U.S. cents by year-end, compared with a previous
projection of 82.  New Zealand’s currency gained versus more than half of its
16 major counterparts after a central bank report showed the
proportion of  government bonds  held by international investors
climbed last month to 64 percent from 62.7 percent in November,
the highest since June 2010.  The  yield  on the nation’s 10-year debt was little changed
at 3.50 percent. The two-year  swap rate , a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to rate expectations,
declined one basis point to 2.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
