The group holding foreign hostages
in  Algeria  is demanding that  France  end its military operation
against Islamist insurgents in neighboring Mali, according to
Mauritania’s private ANI news agency.  The group, calling itself the “Signatories by Blood”
battalion, said it holds “more than 40 crusaders including 7
Americans, French, British and other European nationalities,”
according to ANI.  The Islamist terrorist group said the attack on a gas
facility in southern Algeria is part of a “global campaign to
fight the Jews and Crusaders,” ANI reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
