Central banks added 536 metric tons
of gold to reserves last year, the most in 48 years, and will
buy another 280 tons in this year’s first half,  Thomson Reuters 
GFMS said.  Purchases increased by 17 percent in 2012 and buying in the
first half will be 1.2 percent higher than in the year-earlier
period, the London-based  researcher  said today in a report.
Gross buying increased to 553 tons last year and gross sales
fell for a fifth consecutive year to 17 tons, GFMS said.  Nations from Brazil to  Iraq  to Russia are buying metal to
add to official reserves. GFMS said the figures don’t include
the increase in reserves reported by Turkey, which has been
accepting gold in its  reserve requirements  from commercial
banks.  “With continued monetary loosening in advanced economies,
demand for gold as a reserve asset from  developing countries 
will remain strong in 2013,” GFMS, a unit of Thomson Reuters
Corp., said in the report.  Net gold lending by central banks was little changed in
2012, while “very short-term” lending from some central banks
grew in the last 12 months to earn extra yields and to avoid
storage charges, the researcher said. Leasing rates remained
“very low” throughout the year and fabrication-related
borrowing for jewelry and industrial applications fell because
of tighter credit limits and weaker  consumer spending , it said.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
