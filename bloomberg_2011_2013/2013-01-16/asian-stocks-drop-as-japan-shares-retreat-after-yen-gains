Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index heading for its biggest loss in two
months. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average slid the most since May,
while Chinese shares fell for the first time in three days.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , an automaker that gets 81 percent of its
sales overseas, sank 3 percent in Tokyo as a stronger yen dimmed
the outlook for exporters. GS Yuasa Corp., a supplier of  lithium
batteries  to Boeing Co., slumped 4.5 percent after All Nippon
Airways Co. grounded its fleet of Boeing Dreamliners.

of 7:02 p.m.  Tokyo  time, with more than two stocks falling for
each that rose. The gauge rallied 11 percent from Nov. 14
through yesterday as Japanese shares  surged  on speculation Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe will pursue more aggressive stimulus
policies and reports showed China’s economy is recovering and .  “We’re seeing shares at an overbought level after such a
strong rebound recently,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head
of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages almost $126 billion. “The market just needs to
consolidate before coming back. The fundamentals are looking
better. It’s not going to be a deep correction, just some
consolidation. Markets never go up in a straight line.”  Overheating Signs  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP) ’s 14-day relative strength
index, an indicator of market momentum, reached 75 yesterday. A
level above 70 is considered by some investors as a sign the
shares have risen too far, too fast.  Shares on the Asian gauge traded at 14.2 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.3 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data

index and broader Topix Index were at least 80 yesterday. The
Topix’s RSI has been above 70 for 19 days, the longest streak
since 1989.  “There should be some short-term selling amid a feeling
that shares are overheating and the yen has stopped sliding,”
said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc.  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7 percent as a
report showed the nation’s foreign direct investment declined
for the first full year since 2009 as economic growth slowed and

Kospi Index dropped 0.3 percent and  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index gained 0.5 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.3

in retail and transportation companies overshadowed concern
about discussions on raising the U.S. government’s debt ceiling.  Japanese shares fell even as a report showed the nation’s
machinery orders, an indicator of capital spending, rose 3.9
percent in November from October. The median estimate of 24
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 0.3 percent
increase.  Exporters Drop  Exporters declined after the yen rose for a second day,
extending its rebound from the lowest level against the dollar
in more than two years. A stronger yen reduces the overseas
earnings of the nation’s carmakers and electronics manufacturers

Airways slid 1.6 percent to 182 yen. The carrier’s entire fleet
of Boeing 787s was grounded after pilots of one of the jets made
an emergency landing after receiving a battery-fault warning and
smelling smoke, Ryosei Nomura, a spokesman for ANA, said.  Property Tax  Chinese lenders and developers declined after Premier Wen
said China should “gradually” establish a property tax system
that covers trading and ownership. The comments were made during
a visit to the finance ministry yesterday, according to a
statement posted on the central government’s website.  Agricultural Bank of China slipped 2 percent to HK$3.95.
Bank of China Ltd., the nation’s fourth-largest lender, lost 1.1
percent to HK$3.67.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the
biggest mainland homebuilder traded in Hong Kong, fell 0.8
percent to HK$24.80.  Among stocks that gained, Boral Ltd., an Australian
building-materials supplier, jumped 10 percent to A$4.80 after
saying it will cut 1,000 jobs, 7 percent of its workforce, to
reduce costs amid a slowdown in the construction industry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
