Direct Edge Holdings LLC made
changes to its technology to ensure that orders on its EDGA
Exchange are handled the way its rules specify, according to a
 notice  by the market operator.  The company said last month that it had discovered two
discrepancies between rules that dictate the execution priority
for orders sent to its EDGA and EDGX trading venues. In one,
orders sent to EDGA may have executed out of sequence, and in
the other hidden orders and those for fewer than 100 shares on
EDGA and EDGX may have been ignored when they should have
traded, Direct Edge said.  The disclosure of the changes comes after an announcement
last week by Bats Global Markets Inc. that computer errors
permitted almost 450,000 bad trades over four years, costing
users less than $500,000 in losses. While Bats’s issue
represented a violation of Securities and Exchange Commission
rules aimed primarily at ensuring investors get the best
possible price, Direct Edge’s notice made no mention of
violating regulations, saying it was making changes to ensure
its own rules were followed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
