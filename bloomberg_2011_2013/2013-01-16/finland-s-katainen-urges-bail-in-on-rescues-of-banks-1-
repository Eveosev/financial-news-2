Finland  wants bank shareholders and
bondholders to bear the brunt of future rescues, bringing in
taxpayer money to clean up troubled financial businesses only as
a last resort, Finnish Prime Minister  Jyrki Katainen  said.  The setup of euro-area bank regulation needs to change the
“mindset from bail-out to bail-in,” Katainen, allied with
 Germany  and the Netherlands in talks on the new system, told
reporters in Brussels today. “Only in rare, exceptional
occasions, public money should be used.”  While saying the European rescue fund should be limited to
dealing with future banking crises, Katainen said Finland hasn’t
made up its mind how to treat Ireland, which wants European
money to help overcome its banking woes.  Katainen praised Ireland’s economic overhaul without saying
whether it deserves a concession that would smooth its way back
to market financing this year. The treatment of Ireland is an
“open question,” he said.  Aid negotiations for Cyprus are a “delicate issue,”
Katainen said. Russia could contribute, he said, much as non-
euro countries have supported prior bailouts. He echoed German
concerns about  money laundering , saying Cyprus’s creditors
“have to know how the banks are behaving.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
