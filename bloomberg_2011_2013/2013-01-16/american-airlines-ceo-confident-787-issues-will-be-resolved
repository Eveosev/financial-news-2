American Airlines , with pending
orders for 42  Boeing Co. (BA)  787s, said it expects the planemaker to
resolve operating issues that prompted Japanese carriers to park
almost half the world’s Dreamliner fleet.  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American on Jan. 14 disclosed an accelerated
schedule agreement with Boeing that calls for its first 787 to
be delivered in November 2014. The carrier in October said it
wouldn’t receive its initial Dreamliner until after 2014.  “I’m confident that will be a good airplane,”  Tom Horton ,
Fort Worth, Texas-based American’s chief executive officer, said
today in an interview. “Boeing and the operators will work
through the issues. We’re steadfast in our support of the 787.”  All Nippon Airways Co. and Japan Airlines Co. grounded
their 24 Dreamliners through tomorrow after pilots on a domestic
ANA flight got a battery-fault warning and smelled smoke. It was
the most recent in a series of 787 mishaps in that have included
a fire, fuel leaks, electrical faults and a cracked windscreen.  American holds options for 58 more 787 orders. The updated
agreement with Boeing lets it substitute as many as 20 787-8
aircraft for 787-9 planes among those already on order. The
airline will receive new 787s each year through September 2018.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) , the only U.S. carrier
flying the Dreamliner, continued to operate the aircraft as
scheduled today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
