India ’s bonds fell for a second day
after central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said inflation,
which reached a three-year low in December, was still high.  The wholesale-price  index  rose 7.18 percent last month from
a year earlier, the latest data show. Subbarao, who last cut the
repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, will
review monetary policy on Jan. 29. The 10-year bond yield
touched a 30-month low of 7.80 percent on Jan. 14.  “Bonds have dropped due to profit-taking by investors,
after a sharp rally this week, as rate-cut expectations were
tempered by the governor,” said Vivek Rajpal, a fixed-income
strategist in Mumbai at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Inflation is
still high compared to the central bank’s comfort zone.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.86 percent as
of 10:18 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It climbed three basis points yesterday.  The RBI considers an inflation rate between 4 percent and 5
percent as a comfortable level, Deputy Governor K.C. Chakrabarty
said on Nov. 15.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose seven basis
points to 7.57 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
