Saudi Arabia ’s economic growth rate
will slow over the next three years to an annual average of 3.3
percent as the kingdom’s oil production declines,  Samba
Financial Group (SAMBA)  said.  “The main reason for this slowdown is to be found in the
oil sector,” the  Riyadh-based bank  said in an e-mailed report
late yesterday. “The fundamentals are likely to soften in 2013
as additional supply from Iraq and North America has more
impact.”  The government, which derives about 90 percent of revenue
from oil sales, benefited from higher production last year as
international sanctions cut Iranian output. The economy grew an
estimated 6.8 percent in 2012 as  King Abdullah  allocated oil
wealth for projects to expand airports, build roads and real
estate.  The kingdom, which pumped 9.95 million barrels a day on
average in 2012, is likely to produce 4.5 percent less this
year, Samba said. Saudi Arabia produced 9.57 million barrels a
day in December, according to data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  King Abdullah pledged more than $500 billion on social
welfare and to build projects to ensure that the country remains
unscathed by the kind of political unrest that swept through
other Arab countries in the past two years. He is using oil
money to fight high unemployment -- about a quarter of Saudis
between 20 and 30 don’t have jobs -- and to build schools and
hospitals.  Government Spending  “ Government spending  has seen phenomenal growth in recent
years, increasing by an annual average of 13 percent in 2008-
12,” Samba said. “Yet the revenue outlook is beginning to
swing against the government: our oil price and production
assumptions suggest that overall revenue will decline by an
annual average of some 7 percent in 2013-15.”  Saudi Arabia raised its 2013 expenditure target by almost a
fifth to a record 820 billion riyals ($219 billion), the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement on its website no Dec. 29. The
kingdom posted revenue of 1.24 trillion riyals in 2012 as the
price of  Brent crude  held above $100 a barrel for a second year.
Expenditure came in at 853 billion riyals.  Government spending on wages, salaries and unemployment
benefits is “unlikely to be cut,” Samba said. “The government
will reign in  capital spending .” This will impact growth in the
non-oil sector, which Samba forecasts easing to an average of
4.3 percent in 2013 to 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
