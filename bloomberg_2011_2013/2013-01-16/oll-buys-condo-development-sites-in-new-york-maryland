Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, purchased two development sites in
Manhattan, expanding its condominium business in the most
expensive U.S. urban residential market.  Toll bought the sites at 953-961 First Ave., between 52nd
and 53rd streets, and 82 King St., between Hudson and Varick
streets, the Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company said today in a
statement. The buildings will also have retail space. Purchase
prices weren’t disclosed.  The acquisitions will be Toll’s seventh and eighth
buildings in Manhattan, and its 22nd and 23rd in the metro  New
York  City area. The company also has properties in the Brooklyn
borough and in New Jersey’s Hoboken and  Jersey City  under its
City Living division.  “We have continued to expand in order to take advantage of
the strong dynamics of this market,” Douglas Yearley, Toll’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Manhattan ’s inventory of homes for sale plunged to the
lowest in at least 12 years at the end of December, appraiser
Miller Samuel Inc. said in a Jan. 3 report with Douglas Elliman
Real Estate. Fourth-quarter sales surged 29 percent to 2,598,
the highest for the period since at least 1987.  Toll also said it is expanding City Living to the
Washington area. The company purchased a development site in
Bethesda,  Maryland , at 4915 Hampden Lane. Construction on the
property, three blocks from the Bethesda metro station, is
scheduled to begin in the second half of 2013, the company said
today in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
