Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  jumped the most in
almost 21 months after the Islamic unit of the biggest United
Arab Emirates lender forecast a doubling of 2013 profit and amid
bets the bank will boost its full-year dividend.  The shares rallied 6.4 percent, the biggest advance since
April 2011, to 3.31 dirhams at the close in Dubai. About 1.3
million shares were traded today, triple the  three-month daily
average , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock was
the  biggest gainer  on the benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which
added 0.4 percent.  Emirates Islamic Bank PJSC, wholly owned by Emirates NBD,
will seek to boost net income to 150 million dirhams ($41
million) this year from about 80 million in 2012, Chief
Executive Officer Jamal Bin Ghalaita said in a Jan. 14
interview. The bank said last month it would raise capital by 63
percent to 3.9 billion dirhams through a rights issue.  “The projected improvement in its Islamic banking
operation” helped boost the Emirates NBD’s stock, said Nabil Farhat, a partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.
Investors are also expecting a higher dividend payout for 2012,
he added.  Banks in Dubai, still struggling with non-performing loans
stemming from the 2008 real estate crash, are stepping up
efforts to boost  Islamic finance  as the industry’s global assets
are set to double by 2015. Emirates NBD, which offers services
that comply with Islam’s ban on interest through the Dubai-based
unit, is seeking to boost retail lending to 60 percent of the
total from 40 percent now, Bin Ghalaita said.  Dividend Bets  Emirates NBD, which paid a cash dividend of  20 fils per
share for 2011  profit, has a 12-month dividend yield of 6.1
percent. That compares with  3.1 percent  for the Bloomberg GCC
200 Financial Index.  The lender’s  fourth-quarter profit  may more than double to
517 million dirhams when the bank reports the results later this
month, according to the average estimate of six analysts on
Bloomberg. Its shares fell 3.1 percent in 2012, lagging a gain
of 20 percent for the Dubai benchmark index.  Two analysts  recommend investors buy the shares of Emirates
NBD, while five have a hold rating on the stock and one says to
sell, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
