Bank of America Corp. ’s claims
against  MBIA Inc. (MBI)  over the bond insurer’s 2009 restructuring are
supported by an insurance regulator’s refusal to let MBIA make
an interest payment, a lawyer for the bank said.  The decision by New York’s Department of Financial
Services, disclosed yesterday by MBIA, backs claims from
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America and Paris-based
 Societe Generale SA (GLE)  in litigation against the insurer, a lawyer
for the banks said in a letter to state Justice Barbara Kapnick
today. The banks claim assets were improperly transferred out of
MBIA Insurance, harming policyholders.  The regulator’s decision to reject an interest payment on
notes “confirms that MBIA Insurance cannot meet its financial
obligations without the $5 billion improperly siphoned from MBIA
Insurance,” the lawyer, Robert Giuffra, wrote.  Kapnick last year presided over a trial at which the banks
sought to reverse the state’s approval of MBIA’s restructuring.
The judge in December said she was “getting there” on making a
decision in the case. A separate lawsuit is also pending.  Kevin Brown , a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based MBIA,
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the
letter.  The cases are ABN Amro Bank v. Dinallo, 601846-2009, and
ABN Amro Bank v. MBIA, 601475-2009, New York State Supreme
Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
