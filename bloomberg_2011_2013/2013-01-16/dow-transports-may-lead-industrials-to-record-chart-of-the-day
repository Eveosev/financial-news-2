The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  is
better positioned to set a record now that its transportation-
stock counterpart has done so, according to Richard Moroney,
editor of the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter.  As the CHART OF THE DAY illustrates, the Dow Jones
Transportation Average has led the Dow industrials throughout
the current  bull market , which started in March 2009. Yesterday
the Dow transports closed at 5,639.64, an all-time high. The
average had climbed 6.3 percent for the year, its best
performance through Jan. 15 since 1987.  “It’s a legitimate move,” Moroney, who serves as the
chief investment officer at Horizon Investment Services LLC as
well as the newsletter’s editor, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. “I take it as a positive.”  All 20 companies in the Dow transports had gains for the
year as of yesterday. Delta Air Lines Inc., the world’s second-
largest airline, set the pace by rising 15 percent. Most beat
the Dow industrials’ 3.3 percent advance for 2013 as well.  Fourth-quarter earnings reports will largely determine
whether the industrials reach a record any time soon, according
to Moroney. The average would have to advance 4.7 percent to
surpass its peak of 14,164.53 in October 2007. It’s 0.6 percent
away from beating last year’s high.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the first of five Dow industrial
companies scheduled to report this week. Earnings from Bank of
America Corp.,  Intel Corp . and UnitedHealth Group Inc. are set
for tomorrow, and General Electric Co.’s results are due the
next day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
