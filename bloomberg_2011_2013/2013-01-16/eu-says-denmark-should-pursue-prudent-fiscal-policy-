Denmark should keep  government
spending  in check to prevent its  budget deficit  from exceeding
European Union targets, EU spokesman Simon O’Connor said today.  “There is a strong case for Denmark to continue to pursue
prudent fiscal policy,” O’Connor told reporters in Brussels. He
said Denmark’s structural deficit is “still low but on an
increasing path” and the country’s nominal budget deficit is
also on track to rise closer to the EU’s 3 percent limit.  The EU has not received from Danish authorities any plans
for a budgetary stimulus package, O’Connor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
