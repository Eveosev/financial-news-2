that demand is increasing in  China , the world’s biggest consumer
and importer.  To satisfy domestic mill demand, the government began
selling from state reserves this week, the China National Cotton
Exchange said yesterday. Imports rose 75 percent in December
from a month earlier, another report showed. The  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  on Jan. 11 boosted its forecast of Chinese

delivery advanced 1.6 percent to $14.365 a bushel. Earlier, the
price reached $14.39, the highest since Dec. 26.  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.1 percent to $7.3125

highest settlement since Sept. 18.  Brent oil for February settlement gained 0.3 percent to

it is working to restore most of the oil production flowing
through the Brent pipeline system that was halted after a
platform leak two days ago.  BASE METALS  Copper fell to a two-week low as investment shrank in 2012

months declined 0.6 percent to $7,946 a ton ($3.60 a pound).

demand is easing while global economic growth slows.  On the Comex, gold futures for February delivery slid 70
cents to $1,683.20 an ounce. Yesterday, the price reached
$1,684.90, the highest since Jan. 3.  Silver futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $31.542 an ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for April delivery gained

Btu.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle prices fell the most since November on signs of
