Nigeria , Africa’s most populous
nation, plans to more than triple the value of its insurance
market in four years by improving the reputation of the
industry, Insurance Commissioner Daniel Fola said.  “Our people don’t trust insurance,” he said in an
interview today in Dubai. “We’ve done a considerable amount of
housekeeping to make sure the companies respect the rules.”  The value of insurance contracts should rise to about 1
trillion naira ($6.4 billion) in 2017, about 3 percent of gross
domestic product, from 300 billion naira now, or less than 1
percent of GDP, he said. Penetration should increase to 22.5
percent of the insurable population in four years from 10
percent currently, Fola said.  Compulsory motor-vehicle insurance, which makes up most
contracts now, should remain at about 10 percent by 2017, while
 life insurance  should constitute 7 percent, general business
insurance 3 percent and petroleum companies’ insurance 2.5
percent, he said.  Oil and gas businesses will continue to contract
international companies to insure their Nigerian operations as
the capacity of local insurers is limited, Fola said. As
Africa’s largest oil producer, Nigeria produced about 1.9
million barrels of crude a day in December, according to
Bloomberg data.  The Bloomberg Nigerian Stock Exchange insurance  index , a
measure of the 10 most liquid insurers on the Lagos-based
bourse, has gained 11 percent so far this year, outpacing a 5.8
percent rise in the All Share  Index. (NGSEINDX)   Continental Reinsurance Plc (CONTINSU) 
shares gained 4.9 percent today, while  Aiico Insurance Plc (AIICO)  was
up 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
