Japan’s fiscal stimulus won’t help
the country generate sustained economic growth, said  Juergen Fitschen ,  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s co-chief executive officer.  “Japan is the country that causes me the most concern in
Asia at the moment,” Fitschen said in a speech in Berlin today.
“The call for ever more cheap money, even if it is tempting,
certainly isn’t the solution Japan needs.”  Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister, plans 10.3 trillion yen
($120 billion) in fiscal stimulus to boost employment and stoke
growth. That’s a return to a strategy that failed to end the
country’s stagnation over the last two decades even as the
nation’s debt burden almost tripled and extra stimulus spending
totaled 80 trillion yen, according to  BNP Paribas. (BNP)   Japan would also suffer if  South Korea  became more
competitive by gaining access to “cheap” labor as North Korea
signals it will open its economy to cooperation, said Fitschen,
who spent about three years working in Tokyo for Deutsche Bank.  European countries should also seek to work with Myanmar as
that nation also opens its economy, he said in an address to
Deutsche Bank clients, employees and German lawmakers including
Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  at the lender’s offices.  Fitschen, who leads Europe’s largest bank by assets with
co-CEO Anshu Jain, said he can’t yet make an accurate prediction
for developments on markets and in the wider economy this year.  “It may be that the worst is behind us, but it is too
early to say that we can expect a hint of normality this year,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
