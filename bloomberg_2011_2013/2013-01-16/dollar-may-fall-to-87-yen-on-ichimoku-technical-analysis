The dollar may fall to 87 yen
briefly before resuming its advance, IG Markets Securities Ltd.
said, citing trading patterns.  Until the Bank of  Japan ’s Jan. 21-22 policy meeting,
“there’s an air pocket, and dollar-yen will temporarily trend
lower,” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst at IG Markets in
 Tokyo . “The key point is whether the dollar can drop below the
daily ichimoku chart’s conversion line which has served as
support for the currency since the middle of November.”  Should the greenback break below 88.25 yen, the next key
level will be about 87, he said. If the dollar doesn’t fall
below the 21-day moving average near 86.80 on a closing basis,
the currency will stop its slide at around 87, he said.  The dollar dropped 0.8 percent to 88.19 yen at 7:38 a.m. in
 London , following a 0.8 percent loss yesterday. It would be the
sharpest back-to-back decline since May 18. The greenback
reached 89.67 on Jan. 14, the highest level since June 2010.  The ichimoku’s three signals to buy the dollar are when its
conversion line is higher than the base line, the currency is
above the cloud formed by the leading lines, and the lagging
span is greater than the spot rate, Ishikawa said.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
