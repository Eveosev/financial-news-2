Joba Chamberlain and  Phil Hughes  are
among four New York Yankees pitchers seeking salary arbitration,
the Major League Baseball Players Association said.  A total of 133 players are requesting salary arbitration,
the union said yesterday. Both sides will submit salary
proposals next week, with hearings scheduled next month.  Chamberlain went 1-0 with 22 strikeouts and a 4.35 earned
run average after missing the first part of last season when he
dislocated his ankle while playing on a trampoline with his son.
Hughes had a 16-13 record with a 4.23 ERA. Teammates Boone Logan
(7-2, 3.74 ERA) and David Robertson (2-7, 2.67) also filed for
arbitration.  First baseman  Ike Davis , second baseman Dan Murphy and
pitcher Bobby Parnell of the New York Mets are on the list.  The Boston Red Sox have the most players at nine, including
outfielder  Jacoby Ellsbury .  Also on the list are Chicago Cubs starter Matt Garza,
Pittsburgh Pirates infielder Garrett Jones, San Francisco Giants
outfielder Hunter Pence and Washington Nationals infielder Ian Desmond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
