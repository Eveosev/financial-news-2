EZ Tec Empreendimentos e
Participacoes SA , a Brazilian real estate company that has
trailed analysts’ revenue estimates for three quarters, headed
to a two-month high after closing its biggest-ever sale.  Shares rallied 3 percent to 27.10 reais at 1:50 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . A close at that level would be the highest since Nov. 9.
It was the best performance on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate
index, which fell 0.4 percent.  EZ Tec sold one of two office towers it is building in Sao
Paulo to  Sao Carlos Empreendimentos e Participacoes SA  for 564
million reais ($276 million), according to a regulatory filing
late yesterday. The company said in an e-mailed statement that
the transaction was the biggest in its history. The project is
scheduled to be complete by the end of next year.  “The sale will boost short-term profitability,” Rene Brandt, an analyst at Banco J. Safra, wrote in a note to clients
dated today. Based on the project costs EZ Tec disclosed in its
most recent earnings report, the transaction “implies a boost
of around 240 million reais on revenues and 126 million reais on
gross profit” for the first quarter, Brandt wrote.  Sao Carlos shares rose 3.3 percent to 46.50 reais.  Press officials for EZ Tec and Sao Carlos didn’t
immediately respond to phone calls from  Bloomberg News  seeking
comment.  EZ Tec’s adjusted revenue rose 26 percent to 212.6 million
reais in the third quarter of 2012 from the same period of 2011,
trailing the average estimate of 225.5 million reais of four
analysts, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It was the third
consecutive time that sales trailed forecast.  EZ Tec gained 63 percent in 2012, while Sao Carlos soared
86 percent and the real estate index rose 22 percent during that
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
