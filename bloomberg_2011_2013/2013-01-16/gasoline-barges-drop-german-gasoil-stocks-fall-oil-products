European gasoline barges were bid
and offered lowered even as no trades were completed. The fuel’s
crack, or premium to  Brent crude , declined to the lowest in more
than two weeks.  Household and commercial heating oil tanks in  Germany , the
continent’s largest market for the fuel, dropped in December
from a month ago, according to Ipsos Loyalty GmbH. Gasoil slid
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  Light Products  Gasoline barges  in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub
were bid and offered from $953 to $961 a metric ton, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That’s down from $964 to $970 yesterday.  Prompt deliveries of Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to finished fuel, traded yesterday at a $4.49 a ton
discount to February swaps, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The market moved into a so-called  contango  structure
on Jan. 11, which may reflect declining near-term demand or
rising supply.  Gasoline’s  crack , a measure of refining profit, shrank 57
cents to $5.93 a barrel as of 11:20 a.m. local time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London . That
compares with $6.51 a barrel the previous session and is the
lowest since Dec. 31.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $8.16 a
barrel, PVM data showed. It was $7.92 yesterday after reaching a
five-month low at the end of last week.  Middle Distillates  German  household heating oil tanks  were 58.7 percent full
in December, according to Ipsos. That’s down from 59.9 percent
in November and compares with 57.6 percent a year earlier, data
sent today in an e-mailed report show.  Commercial inventories  fell to 38.4 percent last month,
versus 41.5 percent in November. The stockpiles were at 45
percent in December 2011, the Ipsos data showed.  Gasoil for February delivery declined $5.75, or 0.6
percent, to $955 a ton as of 12:29 p.m. on ICE. The contract’s
backwardation, or premium to March, shrank $1 to $7.75 a ton.
This market structure can signal rising near-term demand or
falling supply.  “With this backwardation and the decent winter weather,
there will not be a lot of distillates left in tank when winter
comes to an end and the diesel demand starts to kick in,”
 Olivier Jakob , managing director of Switzerland-based researcher
Petromatrix GmbH, said today in a note.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to drop to minus 6
degrees Celsius (21 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 19 from minus 3 today,
according to data from CustomWeather Inc. Temperatures will also
fall below zero in London, Paris and Amsterdam this week, the
data show.  Gasoil’s  crack  climbed to $17.71 a barrel versus $17.58 at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent rose 0.2 percent to $110.53 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
