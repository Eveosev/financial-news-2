Natural gas inventories fell by less
than average last week as milder weather curtailed demand for
the heating fuel, analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles slid 137 billion cubic feet to 3.179 trillion in
the seven days ended Jan. 11, based on the median of 18
estimates. The five-year average stockpile change for the period
is a decline of 144 billion, according to data from the Energy
Information Administration, an arm of the Energy Department.
Last year, supplies fell by 89 billion during that week.  Temperatures were higher than average in the eastern half
of the U.S. last week, said Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland . The low in  New York  on Jan. 10 was 40
degrees Fahrenheit (4 Celsius), 13 above normal, the  National
Weather Service  reported.  “Heating demand in the consuming East likely witnessed a
dramatic move lower throughout the report week,” said Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,
Kentucky.  Heating degree days, a measure of weather-driven energy
demand, probably fell 30 percent compared with a week earlier,
Bickel said.  Stockpile estimates ranged from decreases of 123 billion to
143 billion cubic feet. The EIA’s weekly supply report is
scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Natural gas futures this week have gained 10.8 cents, or
3.2 percent, to settle at 3.435 per million British thermal
units today on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have
risen 29 percent from a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
