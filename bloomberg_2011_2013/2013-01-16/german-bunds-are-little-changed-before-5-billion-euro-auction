Germany ’s government bonds advanced
a third day as demand increased as the nation sold 4 billion
euros ($5.3 billion) of new 10-year debt.  Two-year notes rose for the first time in a week as
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s government lowered its growth
forecast, boosting the appeal of the region’s safest assets.
Spanish bonds fell after Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said the strength of the euro threatened the European
economy. Portuguese two-year notes jumped as borrowing costs
declined at a bill sale.  “The amount sold at the auction was good, with bids above
the average from last year,” said Mathias Van Der Jeugt, a
fixed-income strategist at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “The recent
increase in German yields has made them relatively attractive.”  The yield on Germany’s 1.5 percent bond due in September
2022 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.50
percent at 4:27 p.m. in  London . The price rose 0.07, or 70 euro
cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to 100.025. The yield climbed
to 1.61 percent on Jan. 11 from 1.32 percent at the end of 2012.  The two-year yield dropped one basis point to 0.13 percent
after rising eight basis points during the previous four days.  Investors submitted bids for 1.7 times the amount of new
1.5 percent bonds due in February 2023 allotted today, compared
with 1.51 times at the previous auction of 10-year securities on
Nov. 21. Germany sold the bonds at an average yield of 1.56
percent, versus 1.40 percent on Nov. 21.  Forecast Cut  The Economy Ministry said in its annual report released
today that German gross domestic product growth will slow to 0.4
percent this year from 0.7 percent in 2012. The previous
forecast for 2013 was 1 percent.  “We assume that the phase of weakness this winter will be
overcome in the course of the year and that our economy gains
traction again,” Economy Minister Philipp Roesler told
reporters in Berlin.  Spanish bonds dropped as Juncker, who leads the group of
euro-area finance ministers, said the currency’s 8.5 percent
gain versus the dollar in the past six months has left it
“dangerously high,” and is posing a fresh threat to the
European economy, He spoke late yesterday at an annual gathering
of business leaders in Luxembourg.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield increased two basis points to
5.04 percent.  Portugal Sale  Portugal ’s borrowing costs fell as the government sold a
combined 2.5 billion euros of three-, 12- and 18-month bills in
its first auction of 2013.  The debt agency said it sold 1.2 billion euros of 12-month
securities at an average yield of 1.609 percent, the lowest
since April 2010, and down from 2.10 percent at the previous
auction on Oct. 17. Investors bought 1 billion euros of 18-month
bills at an average yield of 1.963 percent, the least since it
started selling the debt in April.  The Portuguese  two-year yield  declined 13 basis points to
3.54 percent.  French bonds were little changed before the government
sells securities due in January 2015, April 2017 and May 2018
tomorrow. It will also offer inflation-protected debt. The  10-
year yield  was at 2.13 percent.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spain’s gained 1.9 percent and  Italy ’s rose
1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
