Japanese  shares  plunged, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average falling the most since May, after the
yen climbed a second day, outweighing better-than-expected
machinery orders.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that gets 80 percent of its
revenue outside Japan, slid 4.1 percent. Dai-Ichi Life Insurance
Co. declined 2.9 percent from its highest close since May 2011.
The measure of  price momentum  on the broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
remained above 70, a level some investors use as a sell signal,
for a 19th day. That’s the longest streak since 1989. GS Yuasa
Corp., a supplier of batteries to Boeing Corp., dropped 4.5
percent after All Nippon Airways Co. grounded its fleet of 787
Dreamliner aircraft.  The Nikkei 225 fell 2.6 percent to close at 10,600.44 in
 Tokyo , the steepest decline since May 18. The Topix slid 2
percent to 888.11 after yesterday closing at the highest level
since March 11, 2011, when a record earthquake and tsunami
struck  Japan .  “The correction was rapid because the market went up too
fast,” said Shoichiro Yamauchi, a senior technical analyst at
Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage by market value.
“The yen weakened too quickly, making investors adjust their
positions.”  Yen Strengthens  The Topix capped the longest weekly advance since 1989 on
Jan. 11 after a new government announced a stimulus package.
Japan’s broadest measure of equity performance rose 24 percent
from Nov. 14, when elections were announced, through Jan. 11.
The yen fell 10 percent against the dollar in the period.  The Topix is trading at 1.06 times book value, compared
with 2.20 for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.59 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Shares fell as the yen had its biggest two-day climb since
May, gaining against all 16 major counterparts. A stronger yen
reduces the value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  “The yen’s downtrend is taking a pause and stocks are
reacting to it,” saidTakahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based senior
strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s
third-largest bank by market value.  Canon slid 4.1 percent to 3,250 yen.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,
Japan’s second-largest carmaker by market value, dropped 3
percent to 3,280 yen.  Overheating Signs  The 25-day  Toraku index , which compares the number of
advancing and declining shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, rose
to 158 yesterday. The gauge since Dec. 13 has stayed above 120,
a threshold that indicates to some traders that shares will
slide.  Dai-Ichi Life fell 2.9 percent to 130,000 yen.  Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, dropped 2.9
percent to 469 yen after its 14-day relative strength index rose
to 78 yesterday.  Stocks fell even as Japan’s machinery orders, an indicator
of  capital spending , climbed 3.9 percent in November from the
previous month, the Cabinet Office said today in Tokyo. The
median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was
for a 0.3 percent increase.  U.S. Stocks  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent today. The gauge
yesterday rose 0.1 percent as a rally in retail and
transportation companies outweighed concern about raising the
U.S. government’s debt ceiling.  China saw its first full-year decline in foreign direct
investment since 2009 as economic expansion slowed and factories
relocated in search of cheaper labor, according to a government
report today.                       GS Yuasa dropped 4.5 percent to 321 yen after ANA grounded
its Boeing 787 fleet after smoke in one of the planes forced an
emergency landing. The carrier dropped 1.6 percent to 182 yen.
Japan Airlines Co. also halted all its 787 flights today.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  slid 2.7 percent
to 22.41, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
