Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the largest lender in
the Baltics, nominated Deputy Chairman Anders Sundstroem to
replace Lars Idermark as chairman of the bank’s board.  The company’s nomination committee will propose to re-elect
the existing board members Olav Fjell, Ulrika Francke, Goeran Hedman, Anders Igel, Pia Rudengren,  Charlotte  Stroemberg, Karl-
Henrik Sundstroem and Siv Svensson at its annual general meeting
with shareholders in March, the Stockholm-based lender said in a
statement today. Idermark will keep his board seat, it said.  Sundstroem, 60, who has been deputy chairman since 2009,
will step down from his position as chief executive officer of
Swedish insurer Folksam. The insurer is Swedbank’s largest
shareholder, with 9.2 percent of the lender’s share capital.  “Since Anders Sundstroem has decided to leave his
operational role at Folksam, he will now be able to devote even
more time and energy to Swedbank’s board,” the lender said.  Idermark, who has been chairman since 2010, will join
Swedish forestry company Soedra as CEO, according to the
statement.  “After nine fantastic years as the CEO of Folksam it is
the right time for me to leave the executive role,” Sundstroem
said in a  statement  on Stockholm-based Folksam’s website today,
adding that he will remain the CEO of the insurer until it has
found a replacement for him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
