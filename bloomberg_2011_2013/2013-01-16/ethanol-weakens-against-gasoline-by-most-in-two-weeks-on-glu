Ethanol weakened against gasoline by
the most in two weeks after a government report showed a glut of
the biofuel.  The  spread  expanded 1.48 cents, the most since Dec. 31,
after an Energy Information Administration report showed
 stockpiles  climbed 2.6 percent to 20.4 million barrels, the
highest level in four weeks. Production fell to the lowest level
since the Energy Department’s statistical arm began reporting
data in June 2010.  “The inventory build with production down 5 percent was
shocking,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in
Chicago.  The grain-based additive was 37.84 cents below the price of
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities.
The spread was 36.36 cents yesterday.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery settled unchanged
at $2.343 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, snapping a
seven-day streak of gains, the longest since January 2012.
Prices have advanced 10 percent in the past year.  February-delivery gasoline rose 1.48 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $2.7214 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
motor fuel advanced as refineries reduced operating rates last
week, boosting speculation that seasonal maintenance will reduce
inventories.  Corn for March delivery gained 0.75 cent to $7.3125 a
bushel in  Chicago . Prices have jumped 22 percent in the past
year. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Producers’ Loss  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 30 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  Ethanol producers have tempered output because of higher
corn prices following a drought that withered crops.  A Jan. 11 Agriculture Department report showed corn
stockpiles in the U.S. on Dec. 1 were 8.03 billion bushels, 17
percent less than a year earlier and the lowest in nine years
for that date. The grain is the primary feedstock in making
ethanol in the U.S.  Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering and renewable energy
company, said today it idled output at ethanol mills in York and
Ravenna,  Nebraska , until market conditions improve.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.385 a gallon and in New York the biofuel increased 1
cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.41, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in Chicago rose 1 cent to $2.31 a gallon and on the
West Coast the additive slipped 1 cent to $2.44.  To contact the reporter on this story:
