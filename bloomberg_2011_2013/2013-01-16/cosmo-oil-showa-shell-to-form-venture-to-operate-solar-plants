Cosmo Oil Co. (5007) ,  Showa Shell Sekiyu
K.K. (5002)  and  Development Bank of Japan Inc.  agreed to form a venture
to build and operate solar power plants in  Japan .  The companies plan to construct eight solar stations with a
total capacity of 26 megawatts, they said in a statement today.
The sites for the power plants will mostly be former Cosmo Oil
depots.  Solar Frontier K.K., a unit of Showa Shell, will provide
solar panels for the projects, according to the statement.  Showa Shell and DBJ announced on Jan. 10 that they will set
up a venture to finance utility-scale solar power plants in
Japan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
