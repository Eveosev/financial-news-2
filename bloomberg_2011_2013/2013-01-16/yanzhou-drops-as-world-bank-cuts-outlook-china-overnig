Chinese equities  fell for a second
day in  New York , led by  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG)  and China
Life Insurance Co., after the  World Bank  cut the nation’s 2013
economic growth forecast.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. slid 0.6 percent to a one-week low of
100.89 yesterday. Web retailer Dangdang slumped for a second
day, driving its 10-day volatility to a three-week high. China
Life slid to post the widest discount to  Hong Kong  stock in two
months after Credit Credit Suisse Group AG cut its rating.
Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. dropped to the lowest level this year
while  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  sank the most since November.  The two-day slump in the China-US gauge cut its 2013 gain
to 1.7 percent. The World Bank reduced its estimate for Chinese
expansion to 8.4 percent from a June estimate of 8.6 percent,
and eased its growth forecasts for the developed and emerging
worlds. China, the world’s biggest exporter, sent about 30
percent of its shipments to the U.S. and European Union in 2012.  “We are still looking for a little more pull back in
Chinese equities to buy after the strong rally earlier in the
year,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment officer at Solaris
Group LLC, which manages about $2 billion and sold holdings of
Chinese stocks last year, said by phone from New York. “The
World Bank may be just bringing its forecasts close to reality
as its previous predictions were too high.”  ETF Slips  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.2 percent to $41.21,
the lowest close this week. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 index  was
little changed at 1,472.63.  China’s December economic data including industrial
production and fixed-asset investment as well as a report on
fourth-quarter gross domestic product are due tomorrow. Economic
growth may have recovered to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier, after sliding to a three-year low of 7.4
percent in the previous period, according to the median estimate
of 53 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Dangdang, the biggest online book retailer in  China , slid
4.1 percent to $4.43, the biggest retreat in more than three
weeks as the  10-day volatility  on the stock surged to 67.3
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 27.  China Life’s American depositary receipts lost 2 percent to
$51.05, trading 1.2 percent below its shares in Hong Kong, the
largest  discount  since Nov. 14.  The Beijing-based insurer’s 2012  premium income  was 322.7
billion  yuan , up 1.4 percent from 2011, according to its filing
to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. Credit Suisse cut its
recommendation on the company stock to underperform, or
equivalent of sell, from neutral yesterday.  Yanzhou Slips  ADRs of Yanzhou, based in China’s Shandong province, slid
1.5 percent in its second day of declines to $17.65, the lowest
level since Dec. 31.  China, the world’s top producer and consumer of coal, will
commission 2,950 kilometers (1,833 miles) of coal-transporting
rail lines after startup delays in 2012,  Michael Parker , a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. wrote in an e-
mailed note yesterday.  “Rail capacity growth is a core aspect of our bearishness
on the Chinese coal sector,” Parker wrote in the report. “As
delayed projects are commissioned in 2013, paths to market will
expand and pressure on coal price will persist.”  China’s Qinhuangdao coal price, the benchmark for thermal
coal, was unchanged for a third week as of Jan. 13 after
dropping to a four-month low of 620 yuan ($99.7) to 630 yuan per
ton, according to data from the China Coal Transport and
Distribution Association.  Solars Slide  Trina Solar , China’s third-largest solar maker, fell 7.3
percent to $5.1, the biggest loss since Nov. 20. Its ADRs have
advanced 18 percent in 2013. Trading volume on Trina’s ADRs was
2.9 times the daily average over the past three months,
Bloomberg data showed.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , the
fourth-largest Chinese solar manufacturer, fell 3.4 percent to
$2.8, paring its gain this year to 19 percent.  New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) , the biggest
private educational service provider in China, dropped 3.2
percent to $19.13, after rising in the previous two days.  Beijing-based New Oriental is scheduled to report earnings
on Jan. 29 for the three months ended Nov. 30. The company may
report a net loss of $6.46 million, according to the average
estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be
the  first quarterly loss  since the quarter ended May 31, 2007.  21Vianet Group Inc. (VNET) , an Internet data-center service
provider based in Beijing, jumped 6.9 percent to $10.25, the
biggest gainer on the China-US gauge.  Regulatory Approvals  The Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index, which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, was little changed at 78.67, after a two-day
advance.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  declined 0.8 percent
from a five-month high to 11,907.52, while the  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic Chinese shares slumped 0.7 percent
to 2,309.50 in its first decline in three days.  Chinese regulators are accelerating approvals for overseas
firms to buy the country’s securities at a record pace as local
investors abandon equities.  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s top
foreign-exchange management agency, awarded $15.8 billion of
quotas for qualified foreign institutional investors to trade
stocks and bonds in 2012, according to regulatory data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s more than the previous five years combined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
