India , the world’s second-biggest
cooking oil consumer, will consider imposing a 5 percent duty on
imports of crude palm oil to shield domestic oilseed growers
from cheap supplies, two government officials said.  The cabinet may also discuss raising the tariff on refined
cooking oils to 10 percent from 7.5 percent tomorrow, said the
officials, who declined to be identified as the plan is
confidential. The government plans to review the tax on crude
and refined palm oils, a food ministry official, who declined to
be identified citing government policy, told reporters
yesterday. Food Secretary Sudhir Kumar was not available to
comment on the changes when called on his office number today.  India’s cooking oil  imports  surged 35 percent in December
to 901,092 metric tons after palm oil futures in Malaysia, the
global benchmark, slumped to a three-year low because of record
stockpiles. Malaysia will export palm oil at zero duty for a
second month in February to boost shipments and clear
inventories, Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister
Bernard Dompok said Jan. 14.  The government should impose 10 percent import duty on
crude palm oil and 20 percent on refined palm oil to protect
oilseed farmers, the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India,
representing 875 processors and refiners, said on Dec. 20.  Palm oil represents almost 80 percent of India’s cooking-
oil imports. It buys palm from Indonesia and  Malaysia , and
soybean oil from Brazil and  Argentina .  To contact the reporter on this story:
