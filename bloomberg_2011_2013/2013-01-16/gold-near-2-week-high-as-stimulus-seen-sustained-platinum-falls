Gold futures fell from a one-week
high amid concern that demand is easing while global economic
growth slows. Platinum closed at a three-month high.  Buyers of gold are holding back in anticipation of lower
prices, according to Afshin Nabavi, a senior vice president at
Geneva-based MKS (Switzerland) SA, a bullion refiner. The World
Bank cut its growth forecast for this year and predicted a
second year of contraction in the euro region.  “Any talk about slowing physical demand will put pressure
on prices,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Overall, there is some nervousness because of
slowdown worries.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 70 cents to settle
at $1,683.20 an ounce at 1:34 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday, the price reached $1,684.90, the highest for a most-
active contract since Jan. 3. The metal rallied 7 percent last
year, the 12th straight annual advance.  Silver futures for March delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $31.542 an ounce on the Comex.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery gained 0.2 percent to $1,694.10 an ounce, the
highest closing price since Oct. 9.  Yesterday, the platinum settlement topped gold for the
first time since March.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the world’s biggest producer,
said yesterday it will cut jobs and output in South Africa.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 1.8 percent to
$726.45 an ounce on the Nymex. Earlier, the price reached
$727.90, the highest since Sept. 19, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
