Oil markets have some excess supply
and exporting nations are monitoring  Europe ’s debt crisis to
gauge whether global consumption will expand as much as it did
last year, the United Arab Emirates oil minister said.  The Middle Eastern country is pumping 2.6 million barrels
of crude a day now and would like to supply as much as 3 million
barrels a day this year if buyers need that much, the minister,
Mohamed Al-Hamli, said at the World Future Energy Summit.  “Demand is not in a good shape,” he said in Abu Dhabi.
“It will increase but less than last year. We are revising
demand numbers and waiting to see how the European crisis is
being handled.”  The U.A.E. was the fifth-largest crude producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month,
trailing  Saudi Arabia ,  Iraq ,  Kuwait  and Iran, according to a
monthly report issued by the organization’s secretariat today.
Demand is being led by Asian customers, especially those in
China, Al-Hamli said.  The oil market “is a little bit over supplied but
generally it’s well supplied,” he said.  Total OPEC crude production fell to a 14-month low in
December, mainly because of a 420,800 barrel-a-day reduction by
Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest crude exporter, the report
from OPEC’s Vienna-based secretariat showed, citing secondary
sources for its supply estimates. OPEC kept its estimate for
this year’s global oil demand growth unchanged at 0.9 percent.  OPEC’s 12 members also include Algeria, Angola, Ecuador,
Libya, Nigeria, Qatar and Venezuela. The organization is next
scheduled to meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
