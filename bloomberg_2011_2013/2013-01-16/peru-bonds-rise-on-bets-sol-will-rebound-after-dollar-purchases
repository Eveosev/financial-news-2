Peru ’s sol-denominated bonds rose,
pushing yields down for the first time in three days, on
speculation a rally in the local currency will resume even as
the central bank slows the pace of gains.  The yield on the nation’s 9.91 percent note due in May 2015
dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to a record
low 2.26 percent at 2:48 p.m. in Lima, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.03 centimo to 116.91
centimos per sol.  Peru’s central bank increased  reserve requirements  for sol-
and dollar-denominated deposits on Dec. 30 and has stepped up
greenback purchases to tame the sol. The currency rallied to a
16-year  high  of 2.5390 on Jan. 14, data from the country’s
financial regulator show.  The purchases “put a brake on sol appreciation in the
short term, but the outlook for appreciation in the medium term
hasn’t changed,” said Diego Llona, a bond trader at the local
unit of Banco Santander SA.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5463 per  U.S. dollar 
at today’s close and is down 0.1 percent this week, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank said on its website it bought $150 million
today, extending its purchases this week to $800 million, the
most over three days since January 2008.  Foreign direct investment, the biggest source of dollar
inflows, probably rose to a record $11.1 billion last year,
while non-residents purchased $2.42 billion of Peruvian
securities, the central bank said in a Dec. 14 report.  The yield on Peru’s 7.125 percent dollar bond due in March
2019 fell one basis point to 1.96 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.02 cents to 129.95 cents
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
