Brazil ’s economic growth in 2013
will outpace Mexico’s for the first time in three years as
fiscal stimulus measures and lower interest rates boost domestic
demand, the  World Bank  forecast.  Brazil’s $2.5 trillion economy, the largest in the region,
will grow 3.4 percent this year, up from 0.9 percent in 2012,
while Mexico’s expansion slows to 3.3 percent from 4 percent as
growth in the U.S., its main export market, remains sluggish,
the Washington-based bank said in a report today.  “Particularly in Brazil, the benefits of lower interest
rates are expected to start kicking-in during the course of the
year, which should underpin stronger domestic demand growth,”
the bank said.  Weaker demand for commodities and a slowdown of domestic
demand in larger economies such as Brazil caused  Latin America 
and the Caribbean in 2012 to grow at the slowest rate of the six
developing regions after Eastern Europe-Central Asia, the bank
said. Mexico’s economic growth has outstripped Brazil’s in the
past two years as it is more reliant on manufactured exports to
the U.S.  Brazil’s central bank has cut its benchmark  interest rate 
more than any other Group of 20 nation, pushing it to a record
low of 7.25 percent last year. Mexican policy makers have kept
their key rate unchanged at 4.5 percent for more than three
years.  The bank forecasts Latin America will grow 3.5 percent this
year and 3.9 percent in 2014 and 2015, given a “more
accommodative policy environment” in some larger economies.  Brazil’s  Bovespa (IBOV)  stock index grew 7.4 percent in 2012,
while Mexico’s  index  climbed 17.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
