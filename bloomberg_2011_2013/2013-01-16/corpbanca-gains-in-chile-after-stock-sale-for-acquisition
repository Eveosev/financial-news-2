Corpbanca (CORPBANC)  advanced the most in a
week after demand for new shares it sold to help pay for its
purchase of  Colombia ’s  Helm Bank SA (PFBHELMB)  exceeded supply by a ratio
of seven-to-one.  The lender controlled by Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh
gained 1.8 percent to 6.76 pesos at 11:51 a.m. in Santiago after
earlier rising as much as 5.4 percent in the steepest intraday
advance since Jan. 4. The benchmark Ipsa index retreated 0.1
percent.  Corpbanca sold 12 billion new shares through a book
building process at 6.25 pesos each, according to data from the
stock exchange. It raised approximately $158 million with the
sale today.  “The shares were more than seven times oversubscribed,
which is a sign of the trust that local and international
investors have in Corpbanca’s future,” Chief Executive Officer
Fernando Massu told reporters at the Santiago exchange. Foreign
investors bought 92 percent of the new shares, he said.  Corpbanca plans to sell an additional 47 billion new shares
also at 6.25 pesos each to current shareholders in a rights
offering that will extend between today and Feb. 14, according
to a filing on the website of  Chile ’s securities regulator. The
share sales are part of a financing plan to pay for its $1.28
billion purchase of Helm Bank.  The Santiago-based lender also sold $800 million in five-
year notes last week as part of the funding process. The bank
agreed to buy Banco Santander SA’s Colombian unit in December
2011 for $1.23 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
