The euro-area inflation rate was
unchanged in December as slower energy-cost growth offset higher
prices for food.  Consumer prices increased 2.2 percent, in line with an
initial estimate on Jan. 4, the European Union’s  statistics
office  in Luxembourg said today. In the month, prices rose 0.4
percent.  The  European Central Bank  last week left its benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged at a record low of 0.75 percent as
President  Mario Draghi  saw “positive contagion” in the euro-
area economy. The ECB forecasts consumer prices to grow 1.6
percent this year as the economy contracts 0.3 percent.  Nestle SA (NESN)  last week said it is turning to the Chinese
market after its water business suffered as western consumers
turn to the tap. Nestle owns more than 60 water brands including
Vittel and Pure Life, the world’s best-selling label.  The annual core inflation rate, excluding volatile costs
such as energy, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.5 percent in
December from 1.4 percent a month earlier, today’s report
showed. Energy costs increased 5.2 percent after a 5.7 percent
gain, while food costs rose 3 percent, up from a 2.9 percent
increase in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
