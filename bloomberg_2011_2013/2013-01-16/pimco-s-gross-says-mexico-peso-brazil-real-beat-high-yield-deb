Pacific Investment Management Co.’s
 Bill Gross , the manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said
Mexico’s peso and Brazil’s real are better buys for investors
than high-yield debt.  “Mexican Peso ‘yields’ 4.5%; Brazilian Real ‘yields’
7.25%,” Gross said in comments posted today on Pimco’s Twitter
account.  “Better use of cash than high yield bonds.”  While Mexico’s central bank has held its target rate at
4.50 percent since July 2009, Brazil has lowered its benchmark
3.75 percentage points to 7.25 percent in the past year. Target
rates in Europe, the U.S. and  Japan  are less than 1 percent.  Mexico’s bonds are “attractive” because they offer higher
yields, Gross, Pimco’s co-chief investment officer in  Newport
Beach , California, said Dec. 13. Pimco is the biggest individual
holder of Mexican fixed-rate government debt due in 2020, 2021,
2022 and 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
