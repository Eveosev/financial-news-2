Cia de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo , Latin America’s largest publicly traded water
utility, asked for a 13.1 percent increase to its water-use
tariffs, Valor Economico SA reported, citing  information  from
the state regulator that received the request.  Agencia Reguladora de Saneamento e Energia do Estado de Sao
Paulo, the state sanitation and energy regulator known as
Arsesp, proposed raising the rate by 1.9 percent, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said today in a  report .  Sabesp claims Arsesp’s proposed increase isn’t high enough
to pay for its plans to invest 2 billion reais ($979.2 million)
a year providing everyone in Sao Paulo state with access to
sanitation, according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
