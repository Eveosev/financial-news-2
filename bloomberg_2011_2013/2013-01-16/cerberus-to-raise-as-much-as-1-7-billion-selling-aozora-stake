Cerberus Capital Management LP will
raise as much as 146.1 billion yen ($1.7 billion) selling shares
in  Aozora Bank Ltd. (8304)  as the U.S. private equity firm ends its
nine-year stint in control of the Japanese lender.  The investment company plans to sell the shares for 231 yen
each, Tokyo-based Aozora Bank said in a statement yesterday. The
price is 3.4 percent lower than yesterday’s 239 yen close on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Aozora stock, which more than doubled in
the past four years, slid 2.9 percent to 232 yen at 1:07 p.m.  Cerberus, which oversaw a turnaround at Aozora including
eight years of profit and a 2006 initial public offering, pares
its investment as the bank prepares to pay back a taxpayer
bailout,  repurchase shares  and boost dividends. The sale would
raise less than the 158.1 billion yen the shares were worth at
the close on Jan. 7, when the bank announced the deal.  The private equity company plans to sell as many as 632.5
million shares, according to the Jan. 7 statement by Aozora. As
many as half of the shares will be offered to overseas
investors. New York-based Cerberus will cut its voting rights to
7.7 percent from 57.8 percent.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and Morgan Stanley are coordinating the
global offering. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc are
helping to manage the overseas portion as Daiwa Securities Group
Inc. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. work on the
domestic sale, Aozora said last week.  Blue Skies  Cerberus, founded by Stephen Feinberg, lost a bid to gain
control of Aozora in 2000, before succeeding in 2003 when it
bought a stake held by mobile carrier  Softbank Corp. (9984)  The
lender’s predecessor, Nippon Credit Bank, failed in 1998 as bad
loans mounted following the collapse of the nation’s  asset
bubble . After being temporarily nationalized, the bank was
privatized in 2000.  Aozora, which means “blue skies” in Japanese, has since
made a  profit  in every fiscal year except the 12 months ended
March 2009, when the global financial crisis triggered a
worldwide recession. It repaid 127.4 billion yen to the
government when it listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in
November 2006, after raising 351 billion yen from the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
