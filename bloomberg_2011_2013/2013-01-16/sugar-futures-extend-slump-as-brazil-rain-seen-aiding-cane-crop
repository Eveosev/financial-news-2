Sugar futures fell to a one-month
low on speculation that rain is improving the outlook for cane
crops in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer and exporter.  Afternoon showers are expected for growing regions this
week, improving soil moisture, forecaster Somar Meteorologia
said. In the year that starts in March, cane output in the
Center-South, Brazil’s biggest producing region, may climb 11
percent from a year earlier, said Maurilio Biagi Filho, the
world’s second-biggest individual sugar-cane grower and the
chief executive officer of Grupo Maubisa, a miller.  “Rainfall has really picked up in January,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge Group in  New York ,
said in a telephone interview. “There’s been replanting of the
cane and an increase in agricultural yield for the new year.”  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 0.9 pecent to close at
18.45 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
after touching 18.33 cents, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Dec. 13. Prices are down 23 percent from a year
ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
