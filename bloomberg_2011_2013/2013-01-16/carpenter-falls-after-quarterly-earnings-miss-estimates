Carpenter Technology Corp. (CRS) , a U.S.
processor of titanium and stainless steel, fell the most in 15
months after it reported fiscal second-quarter profit that
trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares  fell 5.3 percent to $51.05 at 10:41 a.m. in New
York after earlier declining 7.5 percent, the most intraday
since October 2011.  Profit was about 61 to 62 cents a share in the three months
through December, the Reading, Pennsylvania-based company said
in a preliminary earnings statement yesterday after the close of
trading. The average of 11 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
for profit excluding one-time items of 71 cents.  Carpenter sees “uncertainty in demand for lower-value mill
products,” Chief Executive Officer William A. Wulfsohn said in
the statement. The performance-engineered products  unit , which
includes its titanium and powder metals businesses, also is
“performing below plan,” he said.  The company’s customers include Boeing Co. and General
Electric Co., according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Carpenter said it will report its  second-quarter earnings 
on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
