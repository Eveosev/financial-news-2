The U.S. will formally recognize the
government in Somalia tomorrow, a step that paves the way for
the U.S. and international finance organizations to aid the war-
torn African nation.  “It’s the start of a significant process that underscores
the return to stability that has occurred in Somalia over the
last four years,” U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African
Affairs Johnnie Carson said today to reporters.  While the U.S. never suspended relations with Somalia, it
closed its embassy when the central government collapsed in 1991
during the country’s civil war.  The recognition marks a turning point, two decades after
the deadly October 1993 attempt to rescue two U.S. helicopter
crews downed in Mogadishu, an incident portrayed in the movie
“Black Hawk Down.”  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton plans to exchange
diplomatic notes with Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud
tomorrow in a meeting at the State Department.  Mohamoud is in  Washington  to meet with the administration
and officials at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.  Carson said that during a 2009 meeting with Somalia’s
transitional government, Clinton set out two priorities: to keep
the government stable and to rout al-Shabaab, a cell of al-Qaeda
that controls large parts of southern Somalia.  “That has been our primary objective and it has been
accomplished,” Carson said.  The terrorist group no longer controls any of Somalia’s
major cities and its hold has been broken, the assistant
secretary said. “Al Shabaab is on the run,” Carson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
