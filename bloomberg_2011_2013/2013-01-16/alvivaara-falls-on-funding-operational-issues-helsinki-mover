Talvivaara Mining Co. (TALV) , a Finnish
nickel miner, slid the most in two months in Helsinki trading
after it said efforts to resume ore production, halted since
September by excess water, were still proving “challenging.”  Talvivaara dropped 6.6 percent, the steepest decline since
Nov. 12, to 1.20 euros by the close in the city.  The company said it’s in talks to idle as many as 230
workers for as long as 90 days because of the production halt.
Talvivaara, which produced 2,317 metric tons of nickel in the
fourth quarter and 12,916 tons in 2012, wants to resume
operations at its Sotkamo mine in eastern  Finland  by June.  It’s also seeking to raise funds to secure financial
flexibility and liquidity through options including debt,
convertible bonds, royalty streams or equity.  “We remain cautious given the uncertainty around the level
of financing and operational issues,” Ben Davis, an analyst at
Liberum Capital Ltd. in  London , said in a note.  Talvivaara, based in Espoo, on Nov. 28 cut its fourth-
quarter nickel production target by 38 percent to 2,500 tons and
its full-year projection by 24 percent to 13,000 tons after
heavy rains damaged its metal heap. It also halted metal
production from Nov. 4 and Nov. 21 to stem a waste-water leak
that contaminated nearby waters with nickel, zinc and uranium.  The leak cost the company about 13 million euros ($17
million) in the fourth quarter, it said. The company saved 20
million euros in operating costs last year and estimated further
savings of 30 million euros this year from the production halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
