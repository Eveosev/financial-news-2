South African corn futures rose to
the highest level almost in almost four weeks as as continuing
dry weather in  Brazil  affects crops amid declining world
supplies.  White corn for delivery in March, the most active contract,
climbed 2.2 percent to 2,211 rand ($250) a metric ton, the
highest since Dec. 20, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in
July, gained 1.9 percent to 2,126 rand a ton.  Mostly dry weather during the next seven to 10 days and
warmer temperatures will deplete soil moisture and increase
stress on developing crops in Rio Grande do Sul, forecaster DTN
said in a report yesterday. Inventories of corn on Dec. 1 were
8.03 billion bushels, 17 percent less than the 9.647 billion
held a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in
a  report  on Jan. 11.  “Our corn prices are down due to the fact that there have
been concerns over  Argentina  and the south of Brazil being
dry,” Theo Venter, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based
Senwes Ltd., said by phone. “There hasn’t been much rain
falling over their harvest, so it’s making international prices
go up.”  Corn for March delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $7.335 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:47 p.m. in  London .  In South Africa, the biggest producer of the grain in the
continent, white corn is a staple food, while the yellow type is
used as animal feed.  Wheat for March delivery rose 2.4 percent to 3,650 rand a
metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
