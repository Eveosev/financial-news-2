An apartment building collapsed in
the Egyptian city of Alexandria, killing at least 22 people a
day after President Mohamed Mursi came under fire from his
critics after a train crash killed 19 others.  The 24-apartment building collapsed early today, Major-
General Abdel-Aziz Tawfik, the interior minister’s assistant for
the civil defense forces, said by phone. The building was
constructed without a license, the state-run Middle East news
agency reported, citing housing minister.  Mursi vowed to hold accountable those responsible for
yesterday’s train crash, which came about two months after
another train smashed into a school bus in southern  Egypt ,
killing 50 children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
