Thomas Candillier, the Paris-based
head of European cash equity sales at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , has
died at the age of 37.  JPMorgan declined to comment on the cause of death.
Candillier is survived by his wife and children.  Brian Marchiony , a JPMorgan spokesman in London,
said Candillier will be “dearly missed.” The trader joined
JPMorgan in 2001 after starting his financial career in energy
derivative sales at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 1999.
Candillier, who rose in the ranks at JPMorgan’s cash equity
sales unit in  Europe , was educated at France’s ESSEC Business
School, according to his LinkedIn profile.  He “was a wonderful leader, colleague, mentor, and
friend,” Patrick Burrowes, head of cash equities for Europe,
Middle East and  Africa , and other senior colleagues at the New
York-based bank said in a memo to employees yesterday.
Candillier passed away on Jan. 14, according to the memo.  His previous roles at JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, included running the French sales team for cash
equities. He was promoted to executive director in 2005 at
JPMorgan and was most recently a managing director at the bank.  “Our thoughts are with his family during this most
difficult time,” Burrowes and his colleagues said in the memo.  JPMorgan was the third-largest broker by reported equity
trades in German exchanges last year, and fourth in  London  and
Paris, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
