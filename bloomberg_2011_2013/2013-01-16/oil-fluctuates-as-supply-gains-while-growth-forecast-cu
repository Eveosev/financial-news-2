Oil rose to the highest level in
almost four months on an unexpected drop in U.S. inventories as
imports declined and petroleum consumption increased.  Prices gained 1 percent after the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
 stockpiles  fell 951,000 barrels last week. A gain of 2.2 million
was the median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Consumption rebounded from the lowest level since March.  “The drawdown in crude oil caught the market by
surprise,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “Supplies are becoming tighter than
expected.”  West  Texas  Intermediate crude for February delivery climbed
96 cents to $94.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the highest settlement since Sept. 18. Prices have risen 2.3
percent since the beginning of the year. Volume was 37 percent
above the 100-day average.  Brent for February settlement, which expires today, gained
31 cents to $110.61 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The more-active March contract added 5 cents to
$109.68. Volume was 7.6 percent below the 100-day average.  The front-month European benchmark contract settled at a
premium of $16.37 to WTI, the narrowest spread since Sept. 19.  Crude Stockpiles  Oil inventories decreased to 360.3 million in the seven
days ended Jan. 11 as imports fell 3.7 percent to 8.03 million
barrels a day, the EIA said in the weekly report. Imports jumped
18 percent the previous week, following a 12 percent drop in the
week ended Dec. 28.  Companies in Gulf Coast states delay imports and minimize
supplies at the end of the year to reduce local taxes. Those
imports were brought ashore in the first week of the new year,
Flynn said.  “Oil imports are the most volatile series” in the EIA
report, said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in  New York . The drop in imports “resulted in a net
decline in crude oil inventories.”  Total petroleum  consumption  rebounded from the lowest level
since March, climbing 1.1 percent to 18 million barrels a day
last week, the report showed. Gasoline demand jumped 3.9 percent
to 8.32 million barrels a day.  U.S. Output  The EIA also reported that U.S. domestic production climbed
to 7.04 million barrels a day, the highest level since January
1993. A combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic
fracturing, or fracking, has unlocked supplies trapped in shale
formations in states including  North Dakota , Texas and  Oklahoma .  Stocks at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI
futures, gained 1.78 million barrels to a record 51.9 million.
Inventories may fall this week after the Seaway pipeline, which
ships oil from Cushing to the  Gulf Coast , resumed service on
Jan. 11 at an increased capacity of 400,000 barrels a day from
150,000.  Gasoline  stockpiles  rose 1.91 million barrels to 235
million, the EIA said. Analysts had expected a gain of 2.7
million, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Distillate fuels ,
which include heating oil and diesel, grew 1.67 million to 132.4
million barrels. They were forecast to increase 1.5 million.  “We are seeing momentum to the upside on the surprising
drop in crude inventories,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based
commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “But it may
be short-lived due to the build in gasoline and heating oil.”  Refinery Rates  Refineries operated at a rate of 87.9 percent, down from
the previous week’s 89.1 percent, the EIA report showed.  Oil also gained as an al-Qaeda-linked group took an unknown
number of foreign hostages after a pre-dawn attack on a gas
facility in southern  Algeria  partly operated by  BP Plc. (BP/)  U.S.
citizens are among the hostages taken, said  Victoria Nuland , a
State Department spokeswoman.  “The hostage-taking in Algeria is worrying, even though it
occurred at a gas facility,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9
billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing
director at Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “Something
like this could occur at an isolated oil field and disrupt
supply.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 617,414
contracts as of 3:33 p.m. Volume totaled 604,961 contracts
yesterday, 25 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.5 million, the most since Dec. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
