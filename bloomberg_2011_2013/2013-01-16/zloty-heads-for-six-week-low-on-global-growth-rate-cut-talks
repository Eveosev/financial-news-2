The zloty headed for its lowest
level in almost six weeks as a cut in the  World Bank ’s global
growth forecast weakened emerging-market assets and amid
mounting expectations the Polish central bank will cut  interest
rates  next month.  The zloty lost 0.3 percent to 4.1278 per euro at 10:26 a.m.
in Warsaw, poised for its lowest level since Dec. 6. Yields on
10-year notes rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 4.08 percent, increasing for a second day.  Emerging-market stocks fell to a two-week low and
currencies weakened as the World Bank projected the global
economy will expand 2.4 percent this year, down from a June
forecast of 3 percent. Poland’s inflation rate fell to 2.4
percent, or below the central bank’s target, a report showed
yesterday, bolstering expectations for a fourth rate cut in
February.  “The zloty is suffering from deteriorating sentiment
globally,” Joanna Bachert, an analyst at PKO Bank Polski SA,
said in an e-mailed report today from Warsaw. “It’s also due to
expectations for a rate cut and technical factors as the euro
has built a strong support at 4.1 zloty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
