Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development since the beginning of President  Barack Obama ’s first term, is planning to stay in his job through the second term, an agency spokesman said.  “The president has asked him to stay on for a second term, and he is delighted to continue his work for HUD and the American people,” Alex Wohl, a spokesman for the agency, said in a telephone interview.  As HUD secretary, Donovan, 46, is in charge of the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage insurer that backs about 15 percent of loans for home purchases, as well as the nation’s housing programs for the poor. He took on additional duties in December when Obama appointed him to lead a task force on recovery efforts in areas that suffered damage from  Hurricane Sandy .  Before joining HUD in 2009, Donovan served as commissioner of the  New York  City Department of Housing Preservation and Development.  -- Editors: Gregory Mott, Anthony Gnoffo  To contact the reporter on this story: Clea Benson in Washington at  cbenson20@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Maura Reynolds at  mreynolds34@bloomberg.net
