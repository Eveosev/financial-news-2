Portugal ’s borrowing costs fell as
the government sold a combined 2.5 billion euros ($3.32 billion)
of three-, 12- and 18-month bills in its first auction of 2013.  The debt agency said it sold 1.2 billion euros of 12-month
securities at an average yield of 1.609 percent, the lowest
since April 2010, and down from 2.10 percent at the previous
auction on Oct. 17. Investors bought 1 billion euros of 18-month
bills at an average yield of 1.963 percent, the least since it
started selling the debt in April.  The 300 million euros of three-month securities were
auctioned at 0.667 percent, versus 1.936 percent on Nov. 21.  The benchmark two-year yield fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 3.54 percent at 1:38 p.m. in  London  after
dropping to 3.09 percent on Dec. 17, the lowest level since
November 2010.  The 10-year yield climbed seven basis points to 6.39
percent. The extra yield investors demand to hold Portugal’s 10-
year securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds has
narrowed to 4.84 percentage points from a euro-area record of 16
percentage points in January 2012.  Higher Taxes  Yields have dropped at auctions and in the secondary market
as Portugal raises taxes to comply with the terms of a 78
billion-euro aid plan requested by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund in 2011. The country aims to regain
access to bond markets by September and Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  has said if the nation can’t do that for
“external reasons,” it would be able to count on continued
support from the IMF and the EU.  The debt agency said on Jan. 11 net borrowing needs will be
about 11.5 billion euros this year, with financing from issuing
treasury bills of about 5 billion euros. Portugal sold 22
billion euros of bills in 2012, though it hasn’t auctioned bonds
since requesting a bailout in April 2011.  The country has to meet a 5.8 billion-euro redemption of
bonds maturing in September without relying on the EU-led rescue
program, which extends until the middle of 2014. The debt agency
on Oct. 3 exchanged 3.76 billion euros of securities due in
September 2013 for the same value of notes maturing in October
2015, reducing its repayment burden for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
