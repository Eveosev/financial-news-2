The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index advanced as
consumer stocks rallied, outweighing declines by Brazilian raw-
material producers.  B2W Cia. Global do Varejo  led gains by companies that
depend on domestic demand after data from the central bank
signaled the Brazilian economy expanded in November at a faster
pace than analysts had forecast.  Cia. de Bebidas das Americas 
advanced to a record as the MSCI Brazil/Consumer Staples Index
rose the most among 10 industry groups. Steelmaker  Usinas
Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA  tumbled for a second day as
metal prices dropped.  The Bovespa rose 0.1 percent to 61,787.35 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. Thirty-five stocks advanced on the measure
while 29 fell. The real slid 0.3 percent to 2.0424 per dollar.
The central bank held the benchmark lending rate at a record low
7.25 percent after the market closed.  A rally at the end of the session “was probably people
building positions in the last minutes of trading in
anticipation of the central bank decision,” Elton Marques, an
equity trader at HSBC Bank Brasil SA. “The index was negative
for most of the day.”  Brazil ’s seasonally adjusted economic activity index, a
proxy for gross domestic product, rose 0.4 percent in November
from October, the country’s central bank said today. The number
was higher than predicted by all but 3 of 26 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg, whose median estimate was for a 0.2 percent rise.
The gauge rose 2.76 percent from a year earlier.  B2W, EZ Tec  B2W rose 4 percent to 15.86 reais. AmBev, as Bebidas das
Americas is also known, advanced 2 percent to 90.40 reais.
Fashion retailer Cia. Hering jumped 3.3 percent to 38 reais, the
steepest one-day gain since Nov. 1.  Homebuilder  EZ Tec Empreendimentos e Participacoes SA 
jumped 2.3 percent to 26.93 reais after selling a building to
Sao Carlos Empreendimentos e Participacoes SA for 564 million
reais.  The Bovespa earlier slid as much as 0.8 percent as
commodities exporters tumbled after the  World Bank  projected
that the global economy will expand 2.4 percent, down from a
June forecast of 3 percent, after growing 2.3 percent in 2012.
It lowered its estimate for this year’s economic expansion in
Brazil to 3.4 percent from 4.2 percent, according to its twice-
yearly report.  Usiminas, as Usinas Siderurgicas is also known, slipped 1
percent to 12.20 reais. Competitor Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA
fell 0.2 percent to 12.44 reais. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-
Month Price Commodity Index lost 0.6 percent.  Brazil Growth  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  on Jan. 3 after rising 21
percent from last year’s low on June 5 as stimulus from central
banks around the world eased concern that economic growth might
miss expectations while borrowing costs at a record low in
Brazil boosted equity demand. The index has since pared its gain
to 18 percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge trades at 11.2 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.9 for MSCI’s measure of 21 developing nations’
equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 5.91 billion reais in stocks in  Sao
Paulo  today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.25 billion reais in 2012,
according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporters on this story:
