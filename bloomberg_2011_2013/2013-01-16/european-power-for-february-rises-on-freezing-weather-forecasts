Power for 2014 delivery in  Germany 
and France dropped to records as rising solar output is expected
to cut demand for other electricity sources.  German power, a European benchmark, fell as much as 1.5
percent, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The
equivalent French contract declined 0.3 percent.  Electricity for Germany next year lost 65 cents to 43.30
euros ($57.93) a megawatt-hour, it’s biggest decline since March
6, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The French
equivalent lost 15 cents to 46.20 euros.  As much as 18 percent of electricity demand may be replaced
by solar panels not connected to Germany’s grid, reducing demand
for other sources by 6 to 10 percent by 2020, Per Lekander, a
Paris-based analyst at  UBS AG (UBSN) , said in a research note.  “The unsubsidized solar growth should drive wholesale
power prices further down,” he said.  European power demand was unchanged in 2012 and will
decline 0.7 percent this year on a “still weak economic
outlook,” Paolo Coghe, a Paris-based analyst at  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , said in an e-mailed note. While the bank’s model
represents 63 percent of European Union demand, it doesn’t
include Germany.  In France,  Electricite de France SA  has an unplanned
shutdown at its 1,495-megawatt Civaux-1 nuclear reactor, the
company said on its website. In Germany,  RWE AG  will resume
output at its 634-megawatt Weisweiler-G lignite plant later
tonight after halting the unit Jan. 14 on a boiler fault,
according to the company’s website.  Generation availability in Germany is expected to rise. The
nation’s power output is forecast to climb to 64,200 megawatts
on Jan. 21 from 63,600 megawatts today, European Energy Exchange
AG said on its  transparency website . In  France , nuclear
production will stay unchanged at 58,900 megawatts until Jan.
21, according to data from grid operator  RTE .  To contact the reporter on this story:
