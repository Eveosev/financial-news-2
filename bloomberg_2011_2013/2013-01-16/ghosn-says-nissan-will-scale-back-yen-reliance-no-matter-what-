Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  Chief Executive
Officer Carlos Ghosn said the yen’s recent declines are
insufficient for the company to reconsider plans to scale back
on its reliance on  Japan .  “We don’t want to be a victim, or captive or prisoner of
exchange rates,” Ghosn said in an interview with Bloomberg TV
in Detroit yesterday. “We want to decrease our dependence on
the yen, no matter what.”  Nissan has focused factory expansion to regions outside of
Japan amid a broader shift by manufacturers to counter a yen
that surged almost 40 percent over four years to a postwar high
in 2011, making exports less competitive. Nissan made three in
four vehicles overseas, compared with about half for  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Brazilian-born CEO of Japan’s second-largest carmaker
has said a “neutral territory” of the yen should be about 100
yen to the dollar. The yen was trading at 88.09 against the
dollar as of 4:42 p.m. today, heading for its biggest two-day
advance since May.  The Yokohama, Japan-based company plans to shift production
of Murano crossover vehicles to the Canton, Mississippi plant
from Japan next year.  Nissan also began making Leaf electric cars in Smyrna,
Tennessee this month. The all-electric hatchback used to be
produced solely in Japan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
