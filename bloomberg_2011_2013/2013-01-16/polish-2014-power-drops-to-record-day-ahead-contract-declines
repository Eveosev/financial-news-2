Polish electricity for next year
dropped to a record along with German power, while the day-ahead
contract fell amid rising wind output and lower exports.  Next-year power declined as much as 1.5 percent to 168.15
zloty ($54.15) a megawatt-hour, the lowest since it started
trading in June, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.
The comparable German contract, a European benchmark, fell as
much as 1.3 percent to 43.40 euros ($57.70) a megawatt-hour, the
lowest level since the start of trading in January 2010.  Polish day-ahead electricity decreased 3.6 percent to
188.45 zloty a megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Poland was set to cut exports to  Germany  and the  Czech
Republic  tomorrow, data from the grid manager PSE SA showed.
Wind speeds in Warsaw may rise to 19 kilometers per hour (12
miles per hour) tomorrow, compared with a 10-year average of 13
kph, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and  Hungary  rose 0.7 percent to 54.89 euros a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
 market operators .  To contact the reporter on this story:
