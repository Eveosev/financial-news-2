Gold jewelry fabrication dropped 11
percent in  India  last year because of higher prices and import
taxes and declined in  China  for the first time in nine years,
researcher Thomson Reuters GFMS said.  India’s jewelry fabrication slipped to 593 metric tons, the
London-based  researcher  said today in a report. Recycling in the
country more than doubled to a record 132 tons. Jewelry
fabrication in China declined less than 1 percent to 495 tons
last year, GFMS estimates.  While gold’s high last year in dollars was 6.5 percent
below the all-time high set in 2011, the metal reached a record
priced in rupees in September, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Higher gold prices in rupee terms, the lack of a clear
price trend for certain periods, a patchy monsoon and the
introduction of new taxes” cut demand, GFMS, a unit of  Thomson
Reuters  Corp., said in the report. “A lack of clear price
trend, coupled with a slight slowdown in economic growth, also
undermined Chinese fabrication.”  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
financial and legal information and trading systems.  To contact the reporter on this story:
