Amgen Inc. (AMGN) ’s anemia drug Aranesp
didn’t keep heart failure patients alive longer or out of the
hospital, according to the results of a large study that found
no new safety issues with the drug.  The  trial , begun in 2006, followed 2,278 heart failure
patients who also had anemia and received either Aranesp or a
placebo. The study didn’t meet its main goal of slowing time to
death or hospital admission for worsening heart failure,
 Thousand Oaks , California-based Amgen said today in a statement.  There were “no new safety findings identified in the
study,” Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, said
in the statement. Full results from the study will be presented
at a future medical meeting, the company said.  Aranesp is approved for treating anemia in kidney disease
patients and some cancer patients. It is part of a class of red
blood cell stimulating drugs that can increase the risk of
death, heart attack, stroke, or tumor progression or recurrence
in cancer patients, according to a boxed warning on the drug’s
 label . The warning about heart risk was added in 2007, Ashleigh Koss, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  Sales of the drug were $2.3 billion in 2011 after reaching
$4.1 billion in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
