Wheat rose to a three-week high in
 Chicago  on speculation persistent dry weather and low
temperatures will erode winter crops in the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter. Corn extended its longest rally in a year.  No significant precipitation is expected in the U.S. Great
Plains in the next 10 days, forecaster DTN said in a report
yesterday. Northern and eastern areas of the region may be very
cold, and temperatures in wheat-growing areas in the northern
Midwest may near zero degrees Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees
Celsius), according to the report. The U.S. winter-wheat crop
was in the worst  condition  since 1985 as of the end of November
after dry weather, Department of Agriculture data show.  “Grain markets keep rising as fear about the condition of
the U.S. wheat crop is growing,” Paris-based farm adviser
Agritel said today in an online comment. “It is still too early
to assess the real impact of the water deficit on the
production,” and lower temperatures threaten crops, it said.  Wheat for delivery in March climbed 0.6 percent to $7.875 a
bushel at 5:11 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The grain
touched $7.9075, the highest price since Dec. 26. In Paris,
milling wheat for the same delivery month increased 0.8 percent
to 254.50 euros ($339.01) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Corn for delivery in March gained 0.4 percent to $7.3325 a
bushel in Chicago. The most-active contract rose for a seventh
session yesterday, the longest winning streak since an eight-
session rally ended Dec. 28, 2011. Soybeans for March delivery
added 0.5 percent to $14.21 a bushel. Both crops climbed to
records last year because of the worst U.S. drought since 1956.  Soybean Inventories  Dryness may increase stress on crops in  Brazil , set to
surpass the U.S. as the world’s biggest soybean exporter. Mostly
dry weather in the next 10 days may deplete soil moisture in  Rio
Grande  do Sul state, DTN said. Global soybean supplies on Sept.
30 will be 59.46 million tons, below 59.93 million forecast in
December, the USDA said Jan. 11. Corn output will be 115.99
million tons, under the prior 117.61 million-ton forecast.  “Things are still pretty tight,” Victor Thianpiriya, an
agricultural analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd., said by phone from  Singapore  today. The USDA “didn’t do a
lot to the global balance sheet. Carryout is tight. It’s still
the same theme,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
