Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  fell
the most in more than 2 1/2 years as workers at three of its
mines refused to go to work after the company said jobs may be
cut as part of a restructuring.  Shares in the world’s biggest producer of the metal fell as
much as 7 percent, the biggest intraday drop since May 2010 and
the fourth consecutive day of declines. They traded at 456.70
rand by 11:54 a.m. in Johannesburg, paring gains this year to
2.8 percent. Almost 825,000 shares changed hands, more than
double the daily average over the past three months.  Workers at the Khomanani, Thembelani and Tumela mines
staged an illegal work stoppage, company spokeswoman Mpumi
Sithole said in an e-mailed response to questions. Mines in
Rustenburg, west of Johannesburg, and north of Pilanesberg are
operating as normal, she said. Amplats, as the company is known,
will shut four shafts, cutting annual output by 400,000 ounces,
and putting 14,000 jobs at risk, it said yesterday.  “The market is reacting to any kind of headlines we are
seeing at the moment,” Francois Venter, an equities trader at
Investec Asset Management in Cape Town, said by phone. “It’s
had a good run and now there’s a bit of uncertainty coming back
into the picture.”  Shares in Amplats have fallen 8.8 percent since reaching
500.50 rand on Jan. 10. The company’s 30-day  historical
volatility , a measure of stock swings, increased to 34.66 from
27.07 yesterday. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s 30-day
volatility gauge was at 8.09 from 8.14 previously. A higher
reading means an asset price can have bigger moves.  To contact the reporters on this story:
