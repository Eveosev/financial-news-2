Kinder Morgan  Energy Partners, the
biggest U.S. pipeline company, said fourth-quarter profit rose
as it shipped more gas in its interstate pipeline network.  Net income increased to $614 million from $475 million in
the same quarter of 2011, Houston-based  Kinder Morgan (KMI)  said in a
statement today on Business Wire. After payments to Kinder
Morgan Inc., its parent company, Kinder Morgan earned 64 cents
per unit, 13 cents more than a year ago.  Kinder Morgan’s gas throughput increased after it bought
some of El Paso Corp.’s pipelines from Kinder Morgan Inc. in
August. The parent corporation bought El Paso Corp. in May for
$22.8 billion, creating a 75,000-mile (120,700-kilometer)
pipeline network, and has been selling its assets to  Kinder
Morgan Energy Partners. (KMP)   Those transactions are expected to bolster Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners’ earnings, Brian Watson, who helps manage $3.5
billion in assets at Steelpath Capital Management LLC in Dallas,
Texas, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
