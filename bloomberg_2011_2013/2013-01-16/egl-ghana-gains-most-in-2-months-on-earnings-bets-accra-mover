Enterprise Group Ltd. (EGL) , the second-
biggest insurer on the Ghana Stock Exchange, rose the most in
two months amid speculation that full-year profit increased.  The stock gained 6.4 percent to close at 50 pesewas in the
capital, Accra, the biggest increase since Nov. 16.  The company’s profit after tax was probably 19 million
cedis ($10 million) to 20 million cedis, from 15.5 million cedis
in the nine months through September, said Nana Kofi Agyeman
Gyamfi, a stock trader at Accra-based  Merban Stockbrokers Ltd .
Enterprise posted net income in 2011 of 17.5 million cedis.  “There weren’t any disasters in the last quarter that they
were exposed to,” Gyamfi said. The stock is currently
undervalued, he said.  The annual results are expected from the second week in
February, according to Gyamfi.  Emmanuel Kojo Idun, Enterprise’s director of finance,
wasn’t immediately available to comment, said a man who answered
a phone call from Bloomberg News at his office and declined to
be identified.  To contact the reporter on this story:
