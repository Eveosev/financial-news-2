Slovenia’s risk of holding early
elections is hurting demand for  government bonds , UniCredit Bank
AG said.  The euro-region nation plunged into turmoil after the anti-
corruption agency said Prime Minister  Janez Jansa  failed to
declare all his private assets, prompting his coalition partners
to seek his resignation. Jansa has yet to address the issue.  “The ongoing political crisis is weighing negatively on
long-end Slovenian bonds,” Carlos Ortiz, economist at UniCredit
Bank in  London , wrote in a note to clients today. “We see such
penalization as temporary, with yields back on a declining path
once the political uncertainty has dissipated.”  Slovenia may see its overhaul drive delayed as the early
vote prospect rises. Jansa’s administration, which took power
less than a year ago, pushed through a bank recapitalization
plan, a creation of a wealth fund and changes to the pension
system to avoid seeking a bailout.  The yield on the notes maturing in 2022 rose 13 basis
points yesterday to a two-week high. Today, the yield was little
changed, dropping one basis point to 4.779 at 10:25 a.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The appointment of a successor by Jansa’s party is
clearly the best case scenario as this would guarantee the
stability of government and enable it to push through reforms,”
Ortiz said. “A strong coalition agreement following the last
election may well facilitate this, but early elections can’t be
excluded.”  The Adriatic nation is in a better fiscal and financial
position than most of its periphery peers, Ortiz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
