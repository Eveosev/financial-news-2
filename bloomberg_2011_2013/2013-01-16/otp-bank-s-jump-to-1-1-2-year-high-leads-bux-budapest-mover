OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, soared for a sixth day to the highest in 1 1/2 years,
leading a rally in the benchmark BUX stock index.  OTP’s shares rose 2.8 percent to 4,544 forint, the highest
level since August 2011. The BUX, in which OTP has the second-
highest  weighting  at 32 percent, advanced 0.9 percent.  The Swiss franc declined to the weakest against the euro
since 2011 this week in a boost for foreign-currency borrowers
at Hungarian banks such as OTP, said Peter Varju, a Budapest-
based equities trader at Erste Group Bank AG. Hungary’s moves to
secure foreing-currency funding this week also improved the
assessment of the country’s biggest lender, Varju said.  “Several risk factors started improving at once,” Varju
said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
