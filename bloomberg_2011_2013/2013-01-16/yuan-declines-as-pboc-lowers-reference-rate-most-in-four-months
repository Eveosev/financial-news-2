China ’s  yuan  fell, retreating from a
19-year high, after the central bank cut its  reference rate  by
the most in four months and concern mounted that the global
economy will face setbacks.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the yuan’s reference
rate by 0.09 percent, the most since Sept. 18, to 6.2745 per
dollar. The fixing was 0.97 percent weaker than yesterday’s
close in Shanghai, near the 1 percent limit allowed by the
central bank. The  World Bank  reduced its global growth forecast
to 2.4 percent, from a June estimate of 3 percent, and U.S.
lawmakers are discussing budget cuts. Concern about Europe’s
debt crisis may pick up before Italian elections next month.  “The fixing reflects an increased demand for dollar and
drags today’s spot,” said Tommy Ong, a Hong Kong-based senior
vice president of treasury and markets at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong )
Ltd. “Investors may also want to factor in some uncertainties
such as the U.S. debt ceiling and elections in  Italy  after a
strong rally at the start of this year.”  The yuan declined 0.04 percent to 6.2162 per dollar as of
10:33 a.m. in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency has climbed 0.23 percent this month
and reached 6.2124 on Jan. 14, the strongest level since the
government unified official and market exchange rates at the end
of 1993.  The PBOC and financial institutions bought a net 134.6
billion yuan ($21.7 billion) of foreign currency in December,
the largest amount in 11 months, a sign capital inflows may be
strengthening.  Yuan positions  accumulated from foreign-exchange
purchases increased to 25.9 trillion yuan.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.05
percent to 6.1933 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards fell 0.1 percent to 6.2873 per dollar, a 1.1 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 1.6
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
