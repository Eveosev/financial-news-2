Sun Weijie, chairman of  Yantai Jereh
Oilfield Services Group Co. (002353) , has become a billionaire as shares
of the Chinese oil equipment and service provider he co-founded
surged to a record on news of a supply contract from  Venezuela .  Jereh has been picked by Venezuela’s state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A to supply equipment and tubes valued
at $178 million, the Yantai, China-based company said on Jan.
10. The deal is equal to 40 percent of Jereh’s sales in 2012.  Jereh shares climbed 10 percent, the daily limit, on Jan.
11 in Shenzhen trading and hit a record 59.60  yuan  yesterday.
 The stock  has gained 19 percent since the deal was reported and
84 percent in the past 12 months. Sun is the  largest shareholder 
with 121 million shares worth $1.14 billion, a 26 percent stake,
according to data compiled by  Bloomberg News .  “The fact that Jereh has received major orders from
overseas suggest its product quality has been recognized by the
global market and the company has acquired global
competitiveness,” Pang Linlin, an analyst with Hongyuan
Securities wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 14. “It is
expected to get more orders from overseas market.”  Global oil consumption will climb to a record 90.11 million
barrels per day in 2013 and rise to 91.46 million in 2014, the
U.S. Energy Department forecast this month. The agency also
increased crude-oil price projections for 2013.  Venezuela, the biggest oil exporter in the Americas, has
the largest petroleum reserves in the world. It has become the
biggest recipient of Chinese credit in the region as the
nationalization of more than 1,000 companies and currency and
price controls drive away other lenders.  Sun Rises  Sun, 49, worked at a vocational school affiliated with a
gold mining company before founding Yantai Jereh in 1999,
according to the company’s website and Sun’s biography on the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  Cheng Yongfeng, board secretary of Jereh, declined to
comment on Sun’s net worth yesterday and said Sun couldn’t be
reached.  Profit of Jereh, based in eastern  China ’s Shandong
Province, increased 50 percent in 2011 to 424 million yuan ($68
million). Overseas revenue accounted for about a third of the
company’s sales in 2011, up from 22 percent in the previous
year, according to  data compiled  by Bloomberg.  Sun, along with other two founders Wang Kunxiao and Liu
Zhenfeng, first sold shares in the company in January 2010 on
the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Its share price has more than
doubled since the initial public offering.  Zong Qinghou , chairman of beverage maker Hangzhou Wahaha
Group Co. is China’s richest man with a net worth of $16.6
billion as of Jan. 16, ranking him No. 47 in the world,
