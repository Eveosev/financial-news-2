Hundreds of Indonesian workers
joined protests in Jakarta today to urge the government to roll
back increases in electricity and gas prices that they say are
stalling efforts to introduce higher minimum wages.  The energy ministry raised electricity tariffs by 15
percent starting Jan. 1 to help cut subsidy costs by 14 trillion
rupiah ($1.45 billion). The increase has prompted companies to
delay the implementation of higher minimum wages, Subiyanto,
secretary general of the Confederation of Indonesian Labour
Union, said today in an interview in Jakarta.  “We demand the government cancel the increase in
electricity and gas tariffs because it will hurt workers,”
Subiyanto said. “Companies have been postponing minimum wage
increases because of higher electricity tariffs.”  Jakarta Governor Joko Widodo last year approved a 44
percent increase in minimum wages for workers in Jakarta to 2.2
million rupiah a month. Indonesian consumer stocks including PT
Gudang Garam and PT Ramayana Lestari Sentosa rallied in the days
after the decision on speculation higher wages would boost
consumer spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
