Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
for a second day after  iron ore  extended a decline from a one-
year high, lowering production costs for the material used in
housing and construction.  Rebar for delivery in May dropped as much as 1.3 percent to
3,927  yuan  ($632) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
and ended the morning session at 3,931 yuan. Futures lost 2.9
percent after touching six-month high of 4047 yuan on Jan. 7.  Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped 1.1 percent to
$152.90 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
The raw material has lost 3.5 percent after reaching $158.50 on
Jan. 8, the highest in more than a year.  “The retreating price of iron ore took away much of the
support for higher prices of rebar,” Cai Yuehui, an analyst at
Ruida Futures Co., said by phone from Quanzhou. “It makes
buyers less willing to stockpile more rebar knowing production
costs may fall more.”  Inventory of rebar in China rose to 5.8 million tons on
Jan. 11, the highest since Oct. 12, according to data from
Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.1 percent to 3,735
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
