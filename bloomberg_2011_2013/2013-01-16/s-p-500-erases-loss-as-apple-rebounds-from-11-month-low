U.S. stocks erased early losses as a
rebound in Apple Inc. led technology shares higher, helping the
market recover from declines triggered by a reduction in the
 World Bank ’s growth forecasts.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed near
1,472 after slumping as much as 0.3 percent. Apple, which slid
below $500 a share yesterday for the first time in 11 months,
rallied 3.3 percent to halt a three-day decline.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
