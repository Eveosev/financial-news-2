Indian (SENSEX)  stocks declined the most in
about a month after the central bank said concerns about
inflation has reduced the scope to ease monetary policy.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 1 percent to
19,795.99, the most since Dec. 21, according to preliminary
closing prices. The gauge surpassed the 20,000 level yesterday
for the first time in two years.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  decreased 3
percent after sales of its Jaguar and Land Rover units missed
estimates.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  led other lenders lower.  The central bank’s limited scope for stimulus “is a big
concern,”  Reserve Bank of India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
in a speech in Lucknow late yesterday. Moderation in inflation
to 7.18 percent in December, the slowest in three years, was a
“decline from a peak, but still quite high,” he said.  The RBI will probably restrict its action at the Jan. 29
review to a 25 basis-point reduction in the repurchase rate to
7.75 percent, 13 of 16 analysts said in a Bloomberg survey. The
rest expect a cut to 7.5 percent.  The central bank signaled last month that monetary policy
must shift toward aiding economic growth, predicting inflation
will moderate. The authority has kept its benchmark borrowing
cost unchanged at 8 percent for five straight meetings. The
 finance ministry  predicts the economy will expand as little as
5.7 percent in the year to March 31, the slowest in a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
