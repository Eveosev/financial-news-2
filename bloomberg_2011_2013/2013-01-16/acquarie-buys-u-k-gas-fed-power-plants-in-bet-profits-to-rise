Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s
largest investment bank, has bought two natural gas-fed power
stations in the U.K. in a bet that profit from burning the fuel
will rise after three years of declines.  Macquarie purchased the 540-megawatt Baglan Bay plant in
 Wales  from General Electric Co. in October, Nicole Grove, a
spokeswoman for the bank in London, said by e-mail yesterday. It
acquired the 819-megawatt Sutton Bridge facility in eastern
England from Electricite de France SA last month. The profit
from burning gas next month, known as the clean-spark spread,
fell 21 percent last year after dropping 48 percent in 2011 and
29 percent in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Banks such as  Barclays Plc (BARC) , Deutsche Bank AG and  UBS AG (UBSN) 
have scaled back their energy and commodities teams in the past
year as they try to cut costs. Utilities including  GDF Suez SA (GSZ) 
have closed, mothballed or delayed at least 3.8 gigawatts of
gas-fed generation capacity in the past two years in the U.K.
and Germany, enough to power about 7.6 million European homes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Forward spark spreads are very low out to 2015 so a gas
plant buyer must be taking a longer term view that spreads will
improve,”  Lakis Athanasiou , an independent equity analyst in
London, said by phone on Jan. 14. Sutton Bridge has an
enterprise value of about 160 million pounds ($256 million)
while Baglan Bay may be worth 150 million pounds, he said.  The  next-month spark spread  was at 1.82 pounds a megawatt-
hour today, down from 2.47 pounds on the same date last year and
as much as 11.47 pounds in October 2009.  Baglan Bay has been halted since Oct. 27 while Sutton
Bridge was generating 804 megawatts at 8 a.m. in London,
 National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Macquarie hired Dan Briggs in September and Suthagar ‘Sid’ Rajeswaran in January as natural gas and power operations
analysts for the bank’s energy trading team in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
