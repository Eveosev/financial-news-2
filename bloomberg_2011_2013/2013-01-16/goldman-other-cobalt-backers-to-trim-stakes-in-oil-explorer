  Cobalt International Energy Inc (CIE) ,
the explorer seeking oil in the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  and West
Africa, fell the most in more than a month after  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  and other backers announced plans to sell 40 million
shares worth more than $1 billion.  Cobalt fell 7.1 percent to $24.84 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since Dec. 12. The share sale would reduce
the holdings of Goldman Sachs and First Reserve Corp. as well as
funds owned by  Carlyle Group LP (CG)  and Riverstone Holdings LLC from
about 15 percent each to less than 13 percent, according to a
filing today.  A successful sale would drop holdings by Cobalt’s  biggest
investors  below 50 percent, requiring the company to qualify a
majority of directors as independent within a year to meet New
York Stock Exchange standards, according to the filing. Cobalt
won’t receive any proceeds from the share sale. The shares have
climbed to as much as $34.03 since first offered to the public
at $13.50 in December 2009.  Cobalt, based in Houston, announced Dec. 5 a
“significant” discovery at its North Platte prospect in the
Gulf of Mexico. The company announced its second discovery off
the coast of Angola July 31. It has yet to  report a profit  as a
public company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Goldman intends to sell 13 million shares, paring its stake
to 12.15 percent from 15.33 percent, according to the filing.
Funds controlled by Carlyle and Riverstone will also offer 13
million shares, trimming their holdings to 12.15 percent. Funds
of First Reserve expect to sell 10 million shares to retain a
12.76 percent stake.  KERN Fund, with investors that include Stanford University
and Caisse de depot et placement due  Quebec , plans to sell 3.9
million shares, trimming its stake to 5.61 percent from 6.56
percent, according to the filing.  Exploration Success  Cobalt’s $1.38 billion of 2.625 percent convertible notes,
which mature in December 2019 and can be swapped for shares at
about $35.69 each, dropped 3.4 cents to 103.5 cents on the
dollar and yielded 2.1 percent at 9:52 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  “We have had successes in our exploration efforts in each
of our focus areas,” Cobalt said in the prospectus filed today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Cobalt has
“long-lived leasehold positions that cannot be replicated,”
according to the filing.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  will handle the sale with
an option to buy as many as 6 million additional shares at the
offer price, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
