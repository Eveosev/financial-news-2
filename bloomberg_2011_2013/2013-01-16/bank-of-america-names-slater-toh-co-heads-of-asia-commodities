Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  appointed
Michael Slater and Colin Toh co-heads of Asia Pacific
commodities, said an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  Slater, based in Singapore, and Toh in Hong Kong will focus
on expanding the bank’s business in derivatives and structured
products, according to the document dated Dec. 24 confirmed by
spokesman Mark Tsang.  Slater started at the bank in 2010 as head of Asia Pacific
commodities trading, and Toh joined last year as head of Asia
Pacific Investor Solution Sales and Structuring, according to
the document.  Benjamin Tsai, Asia Pacific head of commodities since April
2011, left the bank, according to Tsang. Slater and Toh could
not be reached when called on their office phones. An e-mail to
Tsai’s work address bounced back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
