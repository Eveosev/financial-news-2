Most  German stocks  advanced on
growing optimism over U.S. corporate earnings and as a report
showed American industrial production climbed in December.  Adidas AG (ADS)  climbed 2.6 percent after Nomura Holdings Inc.
said the shares have the potential to rally further. Allianz SE
and Munich Re dropped at least 2 percent, following a gauge of
European insurers lower.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 7,680.92 at
5:01 p.m. in  Frankfurt , as two shares on the benchmark measure
rallied for every one that retreated. The DAX has gained 0.9
percent so far this year, becoming the worst performer among the
24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. The broader HDAX
Index increased 0.1 percent today.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported fourth-quarter earnings
of $5.60 a share, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.66.
About 74 percent of the 39 companies listed in the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index that have reported quarterly results so far
beat analyst estimates. Profits for the quarter grew 2.5
percent, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Output from U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose 0.3
percent last month, after a revised 1 percent gain in November,
data from the  Federal Reserve  showed. That matched the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Currency Concern  The euro’s value is “dangerously high,” Juncker, who
leads a group of finance ministers in the 17-member bloc, told
an annual gathering of business leaders in Luxembourg late
yesterday. The currency, which has gained 8 percent against the
 U.S. dollar  in the last six months, declined after his comments.  Germany ’s Economic Ministry said growth in its gross
domestic product will slow to 0.4 percent this year from 0.7
percent in 2012.  The World Bank yesterday projected the world economy will
expand 2.4 percent this year, compared with a June forecast of 3
percent and 2012 growth of 2.3 percent. The Washington-based
bank predicted a second year of contraction in the euro region,
according to its twice-yearly report released yesterday.  European car sales in December fell the most in more than
two years, a report showed. Registrations plunged 16 percent to
838,428 vehicles last month from 997,842 a year earlier, the
Brussels-based European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association,
or ACEA, said. Deliveries in Germany fell 16 percent.  Adidas advanced 2.6 percent to 69.94 euros after Nomura
Holdings said investors should buy the stock if the price
weakens further, citing an “upside potential” of 25 percent to
the target level.  TUI AG jumped 8.8 percent to 8.05 euros. TUI Travel Plc,
its U.K. subsidiary, said it’s in talks to merge with the German
parent in an all-share transaction.  Allianz SE declined 2.4 percent to 103.20 euros and  Munich
Re  slipped 2.4 percent to 131.95 euros. Gauges of European
lenders and insurers were among the worst-performing  industry
groups  on the Stoxx 600.  The volume of shares changing hands on DAX-listed companies
was 4.5 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
