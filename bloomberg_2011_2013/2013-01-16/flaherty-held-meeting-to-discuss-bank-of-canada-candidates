Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said
he has met with the head of a group seeking a replacement for
Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney, who leaves in June before
taking over the Bank of England.  Flaherty met with David Laidley, a member of the Ottawa-
based central bank’s board of outside directors, according to a
statement posted today on the finance department’s website. Bank
directors, Flaherty and a recruitment company will review an
initial list of candidates for the job, according to the
statement. Candidates deemed to be qualified will be interviewed
by the minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
