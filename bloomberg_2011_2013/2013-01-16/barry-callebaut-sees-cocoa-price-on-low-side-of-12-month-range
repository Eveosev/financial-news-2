Cocoa prices will trade on the low
side of the “well-settled range” of the past 12 months in the
short term, according to  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the world’s largest
maker of bulk chocolate.  Average bean prices for the last 12 months were 20 percent
lower than a year earlier, the Zurich-based company said today
in an earnings  presentation  for the three months ended Nov. 30.
Cocoa on NYSE Liffe in London ranged between 1,367 pounds
($2,194) a metric ton to 1,748 pounds in the past 12 months.  The global chocolate market grew by 1.1 percent in volume
in the reporting period, the company said. While Western
Europe’s market didn’t grow, the U.S. experienced a contraction
of 1 percent, according to the presentation.  Higher cocoa butter prices relative to those of beans, or
the so-called butter ratio, are creating “positive prospects”
for the combined ratio in the second-half of the 2012-13 fiscal
year, the company said. The combined ratio is the price of cocoa
powder and the price of cocoa butter divided by that of beans.
The combined ratio is used as a measure of grinding
profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
