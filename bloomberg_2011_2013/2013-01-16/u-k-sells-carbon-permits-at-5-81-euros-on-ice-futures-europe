The U.K. sold 4.1 million European
union carbon permits at 5.81 euros ($7.71) a metric ton in an
auction hosted by ICE Futures  Europe , according to data
published on the exchange’s  website .  The price was 8 euro cents lower than the midpoint of  bids
and offers  for spot Phase 3 permits at 9:57 a.m. London time,
before the auction ended at 10 a.m., according to ICE data. The
discount is the lowest to prevailing spot prices in a Phase 3
auction since Nov. 16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bids in the auction totaled 9.343 million tons, or 2.26
times the amount for sale, ICE data showed. That’s the lowest
so-called bid ratio for a Phase 3 auction since Dec. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
