Belgian painter Luc Tuymans, whose
last New York exhibition depicted the corporate world, returns
to Chelsea with new work rooted in personal references.  His 10th show at David Zwirner gallery opens with a rare
self-portrait, followed by paintings of his leg, his jacket, his
garden.  Initially photographed with an iPhone, the images are then
painted on a blown-up scale, distorting and abstracting the
original until it becomes barely recognizable in the torrent of
wispy brushstrokes and washed-out colors.  Tuymans is an expert in revealing while concealing. In his
self-portrait, he wears glasses painted with light reflections
that hide the eyes’ expression.  “Nothing is to be penetrated,” Tuymans said during a
recent walk-through of the show. “Everything is a shield.”  The works, priced from $1.4 million to $1.8 million, have
all been sold. “The Summer Is Over” runs through Feb. 9 at 519
W. 19th St.; +1-212-727-2070;  http://www.davidzwirner.com/ .  Striped Universe  French artist Daniel Buren has built a career out of
stripes. They have appeared on bridges, escalators, subway
platforms and public squares as well as inside  palaces ,
galleries and museums. They are at once minimal, decorative and
playful -- and always 8.7 centimeters (3.4 inches) wide.  Last week, Buren’s stripes appeared in two Chelsea
exhibitions. At  Petzel  gallery’s new space, they highlight the
architecture, rising to the 19-foot ceiling in vibrant colors
alternating with white. The gallery’s arched skylight is lined
with multicolored acrylic panels, which create kaleidoscopic
shadows on the walls during sunny mornings.  Take time to absorb different color relationships,
intriguing sidelines and interplay between negative and positive
space. Then you start noticing tiny seams that appear throughout
each installation. It turns out, each piece is made of hundreds
of small, striped posters glued to the walls and perfectly lined
up.  Each 125,000-euro ($166,000) installation is unique and
dimensions can be adjusted to individual settings. The show runs
through Feb. 16 at 456 W. 18th St.; +1-212-680-9467;

 Bortolami  gallery.  In one room, triangles of silver and blue stripes glow in
the dark as fiber-optic technology is applied to textiles with
luminous effect. If you unplug the work, it turns into a milky
monochrome.  The rest of the show features striped, rectangular canvases
in various colors under Plexiglas panels painted with white
stripes. The white lines block some of the color underneath to
create various geometric shapes and the illusion of negative
space.  Prices range from $130,000 to $260,000. The show runs
through Feb. 16 at 520 W.20th St.; +1-212-727-2050;

artist  El Anatsui  shows glittering tapestries in his exhibition
“Pot of Wisdom.”  Hung on the walls, they appear as amorphous, sprawling and
undulating shapes.  Some works suggest maps of imaginary countries or
continents. Others glow like Byzantine icons or recall medieval
armor. In fact, each work is made with thousands of metal caps
and foil from liquor bottles.  Prices range from $750,000 to $1.5 million. The show runs
through Jan. 19 at 513 W.20th St.; +1-212-645-1701;
