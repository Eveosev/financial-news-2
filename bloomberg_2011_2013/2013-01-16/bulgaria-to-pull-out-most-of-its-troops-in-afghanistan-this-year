Bulgaria plans to withdraw this year
most of its 600 troops serving with the U.S.-led  International
Security Assistance Force  fighting Taliban insurgents in
 Afghanistan .  The troops will be pulled out in three stages that started
with medical teams from the Herat hospital on Dec. 31, the
government said today in a statement from Sofia. A combat unit
guarding Kabul airport will leave March 1 and troops guarding
Kandahar airport will move out next year.  Some Bulgarian soldiers will remain into the second half of
2014 to train Afghan forces, the government said.  Western forces plan to transfer security to Afghan forces
in all the countryâ€™s provinces by 2014, a target date set by
NATO in 2010. Bulgaria joined the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization in 2004 and has peacekeeping troops in Bosnia and
 Kosovo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
