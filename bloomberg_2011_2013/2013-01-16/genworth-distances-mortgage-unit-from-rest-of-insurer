Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW) , the insurer
that named a new chief executive officer this month, said it is
reorganizing to separate most of the company from the mortgage-
guaranty operation that saddled the firm with losses.  The insurer will create a new parent company, and the
outstanding senior and subordinated notes will remain
obligations of the old parent, Richmond, Virginia-based Genworth
said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  The switch will “remove the U.S. mortgage insurance
subsidiaries from the companies covered by the indenture
governing Genworth’s senior notes,” the insurer said in the
statement.  Tom McInerney, who became CEO this month, is working to
revamp the insurer after losses from the mortgage unit drained
capital. The company also sells  life insurance  and long-term
care coverage.  Genworth said it will contribute $100 million to the
mortgage insurer as part of the plan, which the company expects
to occur in the second quarter. Parts of its plan are still
subject to regulatory approval, the insurer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
