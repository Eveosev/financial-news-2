Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, headed to the lowest in more than a month after
prices for the steelmaking material slid.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  dropped  1.7 percent at 12:21
p.m. in  Sao Paulo , the worst performer in the MSCI
Brazil/Materials  index , after falling as much as 2 percent. A
close at that level would be the lowest since Dec. 13 for the
stock, which traded at 26 percent of the three-month daily
average volume.  Iron ore  for  immediate delivery  slid 4.9 percent to $145.40
a ton today, the biggest fall since Nov. 28, according to data
compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. The decline, which is putting
an end to a rally since September, is bringing down the price of
Vale shares, said William Castro Alves, an analyst at brokerage
XP Investimentos.  “This is totally linked to the correlation between Vale
and iron-ore prices,” he said in a telephone interview from Rio
today. “The recent iron-ore increase was not sustainable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
