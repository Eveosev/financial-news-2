(Corrects reference to fuel economy after 6,000 miles in
the fifth paragraph of story published Jan. 15.)  Ford Motor Co. (F) , facing criticism for
the fuel-economy performance of some of its models, said the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may change its procedures
for testing the mileage of hybrids.  Several of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius hybrid models showed
even bigger fuel-economy shortfalls against the EPA estimates
than the Ford Fusion hybrid and C-Max hybrid when tested for
mileage in city driving by Consumer Reports magazine, Raj Nair,
Ford’s product development chief, said at the Deutsche Bank
Global Auto Industry Conference in Detroit.  “They reflected a lot of differences versus the EPA label
for all manufacturers,” Nair said today on a webcast of the
conference. “There are a lot of factors that can introduce that
type of variability” in actual fuel economy compared with EPA
ratings, including speed and outside temperature, he said.  Ford’s two newest hybrid models fell 17 percent to 21
percent short of the company’s promise of 47 miles (76
kilometers) per gallon in tests by  Consumer Reports , the
Yonkers, New York-based magazine reported last month in a
statement. The Ford Fusion hybrid achieved 39 mpg, while the C-
Max hybrid averaged 37 mpg in tests of city and highway driving,
Consumer Reports said.  Hybrids can lose about 7 miles per gallon when driving at
75 miles per hour rather than 65 mph, Nair said. A difference of
30 degrees in outside temperature can cause a 5 mpg disparity.
Mileage can be another 5 mpg lower for a new hybrid compared
with one that’s been driven at least 6,000 miles, he said.  “We continue to work closely with the EPA to determine
whether the industry testing procedure needs changes for hybrid
vehicle testing,” Nair said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
