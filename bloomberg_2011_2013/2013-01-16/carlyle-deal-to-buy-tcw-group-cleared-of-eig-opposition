EIG Global Energy Partners LLC, the
firm that filed suit last year over  Carlyle Group LP (CG) ’s announced
acquisition of TCW Group Inc., now supports the deal in a
reversal the companies say will allow it to be completed.  EIG, an asset manager spun off from Los Angeles-based TCW,
said in an August complaint that it would face irreparable harm
by the acquisition. EIG operates a fund jointly with TCW and the
deal would give Carlyle, a direct competitor in energy
investments, access to EIG’s sensitive information, the company
said at the time. EIG and Carlyle are based in  Washington .  TCW will keep its financial stake in funds run by EIG,
while EIG will manage the funds’ investments, the three
companies said today in a statement, without disclosing
settlement terms. Carlyle’s acquisition of TCW is set to close
“in the near future,” they said.  “This agreement is a win for everyone involved and we are
pleased to move forward to closing,” Olivier Sarkozy, Carlyle’s
head of global financial services, said in the statement.  Carlyle, the second-largest manager of alternative assets
such as private equity and real estate, agreed in August to buy
TCW in a deal that will give TCW’s management and employees a 40
percent stake. The deal values TCW at $700 million to $800
million, two people familiar with the agreement said at the
time.  TCW, which has about $135 billion in assets under
management, was owned for more than a decade by French bank
 Societe Generale SA. (GLE)   To contact the reporter on this story:
