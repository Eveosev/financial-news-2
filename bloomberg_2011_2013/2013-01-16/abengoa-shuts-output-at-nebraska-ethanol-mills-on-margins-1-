Abengoa SA (ABG) , a Spanish engineering
and renewable energy company, temporarily idled output at
ethanol mills in York and Ravenna,  Nebraska , until market
conditions improve.  The Ravenna plant has the capacity to produce 88 million
gallons of ethanol annually, while the one in York can
manufacture 55 million, Christopher Standlee, a spokesman for
the company, said today in an e-mail.  “We will maintain a ready mode for quick restart when
market conditions improve, but have no definite restart date at
this time,” Standlee said in an e-mail.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery fell 0.8 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $2.335 a gallon at 10:59 a.m. local time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 10 percent in the
past year.  Stockpiles of the biofuel jumped 2.6 percent to 20.4
million barrels in the period ended Jan. 11, the highest level
in four weeks, data from the Energy Department’s Energy
Information Administration showed today.  Corn for March delivery slipped 4.5 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $7.265 a bushel in  Chicago . Prices have jumped 21 percent in
the past year. One bushel of the grain makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Corn Stockpiles  A Jan. 11 Agriculture Department report showed corn
stockpiles in the U.S. on Dec. 1 were 8.03 billion bushels, 17
percent less than a year earlier and the lowest in nine years
for that date. The grain is the primary feedstock used to make
ethanol in the country.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 29 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
30 cents yesterday, according to data collected by Bloomberg.
The figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale
of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production
that can be fed to livestock.  A U.S. Energy Information Administration report today
showed ethanol  production  in the U.S. last week fell to 784,000
barrels a day, the lowest level since the Energy Department’s
analytical arm began tracking weekly data in June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
