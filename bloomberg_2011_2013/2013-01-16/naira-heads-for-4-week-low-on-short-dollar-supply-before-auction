The naira depreciated for a fourth
day on higher demand for the U.S currency after the Nigerian
central bank cut the size of its dollar sales this week,
reducing supply.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 157.09 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira gained 3.9 percent last year, the
strongest performance among African currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold $108.48 million at an
auction today, bringing sales this week to $120.30 million, a 38
percent decline compared with $193.20 million last week,
according to data on its website. The regulator sells foreign
exchange at auctions on Mondays and Wednesdays to stabilize the
naira. Fuel imports have been a source of pressure on the naira,
according to the Abuja-based bank.  “Dollar demand exceeded the supply this week as businesses
resumed for the year,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of
Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd., said by phone today.  Yields on 10-year naira debt rose 13 basis points to 11.44
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
 Financial Markets Dealers Association  website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021
declined two basis points to 3.736 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a fifth day by 0.1 percent to
1.9075 a dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
