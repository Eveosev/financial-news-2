Bank lending activity in  Serbia 
stagnated in December as late payments continued to expand, the
 Serbian Bank Association  said.  New loans rose a nominal 0.2 percent in December, bringing
the full-year loan growth to 18.8 percent, while the “real
growth rate was much lower because of inflation,” which stood
at 12.2 percent in December, Slavica Kovacevic, the chief of the
association’s Credit Bureau, told reporters in Belgrade today.  The stagnation followed three months of credit growth,
driven by subsidized loans backed by the government. The loans,
for which the government pays banks a margin to make sure they
offer cheaper credit to corporate clients, were “exhausted” by
early December and “we hope there will be subsidized loans this
year to liven up credit activity, because economic growth
depends on credit activity,” Kovacevic said.  The rate of late payments, defined as behind by 15 days or
more for corporate clients and at least 60 days for individuals,
expanded to 17.3 percent among companies and 4.6 percent among
households. The rates declined between August and November as
subsidized loans offered companies a chance to repay some old
debts to banks, Kovacevic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
