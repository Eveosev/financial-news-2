Russian gross domestic product may
overtake  Germany ’s by 2020, making the Russian economy the
world’s fifth largest, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said in a
report today.  “ Russia  has strong potential in the short to medium
term,” PWC’s chief economist, John Hawksworth, said in a phone
interview from London today. “It has strength in natural-
resource sectors, which are much in demand.”  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter, will face
declining growth in about a decade because of an aging
population and shrinking workforce, Hawksworth said. By 2050,
Russia’s economy is projected to fall back to sixth place in
purchasing power parity terms, behind Japan, Brazil, India, the
U.S. and China, PWC said in the  report  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
