Phibro, a unit of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., failed to sell  North Sea  Forties crude, its
first offer in about four months. Total SA bid unsuccessfully
for the grade at a higher differential than yesterday’s trade.  Abu Dhabi National Energy Company PJSC, known as Taqa, said
it is working to restore most of the oil production flowing
through the Brent pipeline system that was halted after a
platform leak two days ago.  North Sea  Phibro offered Forties lot F0206 for loading Feb. 6 to Feb.
8 at 40 cents a barrel more than the cash cost of North Sea
crudes for March, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  Total failed to find a seller for the blend loading on Feb.
2 to Feb. 5 at 80 cents more than the benchmark, the survey
showed. That compares with a cargo the company bought yesterday
at plus 70 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days gained 3 cents to 70 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $110.33 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $111.29 in the previous session. The more
actively traded March contract was at $109.88, a discount of 45
cents to February.  A “small” oil leak was discovered at the Cormorant Alpha
platform at 4:15 p.m. London time on Jan. 14, Taqa said
yesterday. That platform handles flows of 90,000 barrels a day
into the Brent pipeline system, which includes 10,000 barrels
from the Cormorant field itself and the rest from other nearby
sites that were shut as a precaution: including Penguin, Dunlin,
Thistle, Murchison, North Cormorant, Alwyn, Tern and Eider.  “Taqa is currently evaluating plans to restore the
throughput of an estimated 80,000 barrels per day in the Brent
pipeline, excluding any Cormorant Alpha production,” the
company said today in a statement.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Russian Urals for a fifth
session, according to the Platts survey.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
narrowed 10 cents to minus 48 cents, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. In northwest  Europe , the  discount  narrowed to
$1.15 from $1.19 yesterday, the data showed.  Russia plans to export two fewer cargoes of Urals from its
ports in the first week of February, a provisional loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Shipments from the Baltic port of Primorsk from Jan. 31 to
Feb. 7 will total 12 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each,
according to the plan. That compares with 13 lots in the
equivalent period this month.  Three 100,000 ton consignments will load from Ust-Luga on
the  Baltic Sea  over the same period, unchanged from this month,
according to the schedule.  Russia will ship four lots of Urals from the Black Sea port
of Novorossiysk in the first six days of February, totaling
440,000 tons, the program shows. That is one 80,000 ton cargo
less than in January. The port will also handle an 80,000 ton
consignment of Siberian Light crude over the period, unchanged
from this month.  OAO Surgutneftegas issued a tender to sell three cargoes of
Urals for loading next month from two Baltic ports, according to
a document obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The company is offering two shipments from Primorsk,
loading from Feb. 2 to Feb. 3 and another from Feb. 5 to Feb. 6,
the document shows. The third cargo is for loading from Ust-Luga
from Feb. 6 to Feb. 7. The tender closes tomorrow at 3 p.m.
Moscow time. Each consignment is of 100,000 metric tons.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 3 cents to $2.19 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show.  Angola  will export 57 cargoes of crude in March, compared
with 50 in February, a preliminary loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News shows.  Shipments will climb to 54.13 million barrels in March, or
1.75 million barrels a day, the plan shows. That compares with
47.19 million barrels, or 1.69 million barrels next month,
according to a final shipping schedule for February.  The March schedule includes one Palanca lot deferred from
the end of January and one Kuito cargo postponed from February.
The consignments range from 300,000 to 1 million barrels.  Equatorial Guinea  plans to reduce exports of Ceiba crude in
March to two cargoes, one less than February, a loading program
obtained by Bloomberg News showed. It will ship the first lot
from March 15 to March 16 and the second on March 28 to March
29, the schedule showed. Each lot is for 1 million barrels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
