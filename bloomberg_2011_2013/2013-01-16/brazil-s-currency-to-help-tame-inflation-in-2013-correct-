(Corrects central bank growth forecast in last paragraph
of story originally published Jan. 11.)  Brazil ’s currency and energy rate
cuts will help tame  inflation  this year, allowing the central
bank to keep  interest rates  at a record low even as growth
accelerates, said Treasury Secretary Arno Augustin.  The weakening real last year was one of the main drivers of
inflation that exceeded the central bank’s 4.5 percent for a
third consecutive year, Augustin said in an interview from his
office in Brasilia. The inflationary impact of Brazil’s effort
to bring its  exchange rate  to a “less distorted level” was
absorbed in 2012, he said.  The currency “is one element why I’m more confident about
what will happen to inflation in 2013,” said Augustin. “I
sincerely don’t see the need of monetary policy to help”
contain inflation.  Brazil’s inflation in December exceeded economists’
forecast for a sixth straight month, pushing annual price
increases to 5.84 percent. The central bank has cut its
benchmark lending rate by 5.25 percentage points since August
2011, to a record 7.25 percent, the most among Group of 20
nations.  The real weakened 11.4 percent in the past 12 months, the
worst performance amid the most traded currencies after the
Japanese yen. The currency dropped 0.3 percent to 2.0348 per
 U.S. dollar  at 1:23 p.m. in  Sao Paulo .  Brazil’s economy expanded 1 percent last year and will grow
3.3 percent in the four quarters through the third quarter of
2013, the central bank estimates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
