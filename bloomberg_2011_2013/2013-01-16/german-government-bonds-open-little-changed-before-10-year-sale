German government bonds opened
little changed before the nation sells as much as five billion
euros of a new 10-year security.  The yield on the 1.5 percent bund maturing in September
2022 was at 1.51 percent. Germany is auctioning bonds due in
February 2023 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
