Lumber prices, which surged 44
percent in 2012, may extend the rally as the U.S. housing
recovery gains traction, said Garrett Soden, the chief executive
officer of  RusForest (RUSF)  AB, a Swedish forestry company.  “Housing starts are still well below the historical
average,” Soden said in an interview in  New York . “There’s
room for demand to increase, and the market is well-placed for
prices to increase.”  New-home construction probably climbed 3.4 percent to an
890,000 annual rate in December, the fastest since July 2008,
according to a Bloomberg survey before a Commerce Department
report tomorrow. In the past 10 years,  starts  averaged 1.26
million, based on government data.  A beetle infestation and reduced sawmill capacity pared
lumber supplies in  North America . Price gains may spread to
other regions because of production cuts in Europe, Soden said.  On Dec. 26, lumber futures on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. reached $399.50 per 1,000 board feet, the highest
since April 2005. Among the 24  raw materials  in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, wheat posted the biggest gain last year
at 19 percent.  Stockholm-based RusForest, which harvests timber and runs
sawmills in  Russia , said last month that it would sell SEK 86
million ($13.2 million) of new shares to its existing
shareholders and SEK 100 million shares of new stock to Russian
investment company Nova Capital as part of a restructuring.  Lumber futures for March delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$377.90 at 8:40 a.m. in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
