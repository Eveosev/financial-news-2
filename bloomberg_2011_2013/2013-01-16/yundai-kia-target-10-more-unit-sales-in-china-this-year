Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and affiliate  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270) , South Korea’s two biggest automakers, aim to
increase combined  China  sales by 10 percent this year as they
expand market share in the world’s largest auto market.  Hyundai said in an e-mailed statement that it aims to sell
970,000 vehicles in 2013, a 13 percent increase from last year,
while Kia plans deliveries to rise 4 percent to 500,000 units.  The two carmakers sold a combined 1.34 million units last
year, becoming the third biggest seller in China, behind
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  General Motors Co. (GM)  Hyundai and Kia are
counting on China to contribute one-fifth of sales volume this
year to help counter slowing global growth.  “Hyundai’s target exceeds the about-10 percent growth
estimate for the auto market in China and shows the company’s
confidence in the market” said Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co. “Hyundai and Kia will both be able
to take advantage of the improving auto demand in the country,
as China is probably the only major auto market that is expected
to see sales growth compared with last year.”  The combined global sales target for Hyundai and Kia this
year is 7.41 million units. The target represents 4.1 percent
growth, the slowest in seven years, and the carmakers today said
they face challenges from a slowing global economy and
intensified competition.  China’s  vehicle  demand will expand by 9.6 percent to 13.94
million units, Hyundai and Kia forecast in the statement. Growth
will accelerate from last year’s 6.6 percent pace, triggered by
expectations of economic stimulus measures by the new
government, the companies said.  Hyundai Motor advanced 0.7 percent to 210,500 won at the
close in Seoul trading, while Kia rose 2.2 percent to 54,600,
the biggest gain since Nov. 29. The benchmark Kospi fell 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
