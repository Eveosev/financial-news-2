Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which
generates the most revenue from equity trading of any bank in
the world, said $1.08 billion of that revenue comes from its
reinsurance business.  The unit produced $880 million of revenue in 2011, Goldman
Sachs said today as it disclosed the contribution for the first
time in its fourth-quarter earnings report. Reinsurance revenue
accounted for 13 percent of the bank’s $8.21 billion of 2012
equities revenue.  The bank is in talks to sell a majority stake in its
reinsurance business in a deal that would value the unit at
about $1.1 billion, The Insurance Insider reported yesterday.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, declined
to comment on the potential sale.  Goldman Sachs Reinsurance Group has a global property and
casualty reinsurance business as well as a life and annuity
reinsurance operations primarily in the U.S. The bank agreed to
in March to buy Ariel Holdings Ltd.’s Bermuda-based insurance
and reinsurance businesses to expand property and casualty
coverage.  Increased reserves in the reinsurance unit added to non-
compensation expenses, the firm said today without providing
figures.  Goldman Sachs’ equities division generated about $2 billion
more than its closest competitor in the first nine months of the
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
