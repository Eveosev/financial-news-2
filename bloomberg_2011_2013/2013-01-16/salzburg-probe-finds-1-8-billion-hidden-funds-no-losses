Austria’s  Salzburg province  owns
undisclosed investments worth 1.35 billion euros ($1.8 billion)
that were accrued through bypassing the province’s government
and hidden from auditors and supervisors.  The investments, which include funds, shares and bonds,
come on top of interest rate swaps and other derivatives that
had been known by the government and have a market value of 451
million euros, Salzburg’s Finance Chief David Brenner told
regional lawmakers today. The investments were made with 1.7
billion euros of loans and the province’s net investment
position is positive, according to Brenner, who presented a
probe into the funds by auditors and investment analysts.  “They were made over years, hidden from all controlling
bodies and eventually caused a political crisis and an
understandable anger and confusion in the population,” Brenner
said in a presentation broadcast via the Internet. Brenner last
month announced he would resign next week following the
presentation of the investigation.  Salzburg initially put the losses at 340 million euros when
Brenner announced Dec. 6 that he fired a civil servant accused
of having run up and hidden the investments. The probe into the
province’s finances then found new and previously unknown
investments made over more than a decade.  Salzburg, the region whose capital is the western Austrian
town of the same name, is one of  Austria ’s nine provinces. It
has a population of 534,000. Its official debt is 874 million
euros, or about half the size of its investment portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
