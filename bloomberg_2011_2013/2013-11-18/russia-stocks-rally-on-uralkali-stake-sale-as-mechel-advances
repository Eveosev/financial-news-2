Russian stocks  headed for the
longest streak of gains in three weeks after billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov  agreed to buy a stake in OAO Uralkali. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) 
extended its rebound after agreeing to restructure debt.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent to 1,502.09 by 12:25 p.m.
in Moscow, taking its three-day rally to 2.3 percent. Uralkali
jumped 3.3 percent to 180.98 rubles, the highest since Sept. 20.
Mechel, the nation’s biggest coking-coal producer, climbed 5.7
percent to 74.50 rubles, after dropping 41 percent on Nov. 13,
the most on record.  Prokhorov’s Onexim Group agreed to buy Suleiman Kerimov’s
21.75 percent stake in potash producer Uralkali, according to a
statement today. Mechel reversed a 30 percent drop last week
after reaching an agreement with a majority of its lenders on
debt restructuring.  “Uralkali is rising on the news that Prokhorov has bought
a stake,” Slava Smolyaninov, a strategist at UralSib Capital in
Moscow, said by phone. “Mechel is a very speculative stock at
the moment; the fact they’ve come to an agreement with banks is
good news.”  A Uralkali sale may defuse a dispute between  Russia  and
Belarus sparked by the company’s July withdrawal from a trading
venture that marketed 40 percent of export shipments in the $20
billion global industry for the soil nutrient.  Mechel, whose  net debt  was $9.55 billion as of June 1, has
as much as $2.48 billion coming due next year, according to a
June presentation on its  website . The stock is the  second-worst
performer  on the benchmark gauge this year, down 66 percent.  China Reform  Russian shares also gained after  China  vowed to carry out
the broadest expansion of economic reforms since at least the
1990s, spurring emerging-market assets.  Chinese leaders pledged to allow more private investment in
state-controlled industries and expand farmers’ land rights post
the Communist Party plenum meeting.  “The market is positive about China’s reforms, because the
proposed changed are meant to liberalize the economy, which is
supportive for all  emerging markets ,” Smolyaninov said.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, retreated 0.4
percent to $93.50 a barrel in  New York . Russia receives about
half of its budget revenue from oil and natural gas sales.  The  RTS Index (RTSI$)  increased 0.4 percent to 1,449.81. Russian
equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21 emerging
economies monitored by Bloomberg, with shares on the Micex
trading at 4.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with
a multiple of 10.7 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
