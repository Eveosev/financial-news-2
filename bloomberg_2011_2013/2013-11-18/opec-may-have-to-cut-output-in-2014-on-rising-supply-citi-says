OPEC may have to reduce crude output
next year amid increasing supply from producers outside the
group including the U.S., Canada,  Kazakhstan  and Brazil,
according to Citigroup Inc.  “2014 looks like a year in which the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries will have to cut,” Citi said
today in a commodities report. “Non-OPEC supply growth looks
robust and demand growth remains underwhelming.”  Non-OPEC supply is expected to grow 1.7 million barrels a
day in 2014, led by North American production, it said. The
startup of Kazakhstan’s Kashagan field should contribute 100,000
barrels a day to non-OPEC output next year, while new oil
projects should come on stream in Brazil. Demand for supply from
the group, or so-called call on OPEC crude, could drop to 29
million barrels a day next year, the bank said. This would be a
1.11 million fall from the 2013 level.  OPEC, which set a collective production target of 30
million barrels a day in December 2011, will next meet to review
targets on Dec. 4 in Vienna. Members of the group, which
supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil, are Algeria,
 Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,
 Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
