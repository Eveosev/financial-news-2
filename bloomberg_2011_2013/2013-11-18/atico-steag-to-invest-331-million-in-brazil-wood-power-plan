Grupo Atico , a Brazilian asset
manager, will build a 750 million-real ($331 million) biomass
project in the northeastern city of Sao Desiderio with Germanyâ€™s
Steag GmbH that will run on wood chips.  The 150-megawatt project will include 25,000 hectares of
eucalyptus plantations and a 70-kilometer (44 mile) power line,
Gustavo Magalhaes, managing partner of Rio de Janeiro-based
Atico, said today in a telephone interview. Atico owns 75
percent of the project through its power-generation fund while
Steag owns the remainder.  Atico and Steag sold energy from the plant at 136.69 reais
a megawatt hour in a government-organized  auction  for new power
projects in August, he said. The plant must begin operations by
January 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
