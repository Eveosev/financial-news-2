Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  swung between gains and losses as investors weighed
 China ’s reform plans against weak demand in winter.  Rebar for May delivery, the most-active contract by volume
on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, was little changed at 3,593
yuan ($590) a metric ton at 11:21 a.m. local time, after rising
and falling as much as 0.2 percent.  China’s leaders pledged to expand farmers’ land rights,
loosen the one-child policy and encourage private investment in
state businesses as data today showed new home prices rose in 69
of 70 cities in October. The property sector is the biggest user
of the steel product in China.  “Rebar is under pressure from seasonally weak demand,
while investors are still waiting for the impact from the third
plenum decisions,” said Huang Huiwen, an analyst at Shanghai
CIFCO Futures Co.  Iron ore for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange
rose 0.2 percent to 933  yuan  a ton.  Iron ore  for immediate
delivery at Tianjin port tracked by The Steel Index gained 0.2
percent to $136.80 a dry ton on Nov. 15.  Rebar for immediate delivery tracked by Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. was little changed at 3,543 yuan a
ton on Nov. 15.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
