Delta Lloyd  NV, the biggest Dutch
provider of group life insurance, scrapped a dividend growth
target as it seeks to boost its solvency.  “The 3 percent annual dividend growth target will no
longer be applied,” given the priority of achieving a 200
percent Insurance Group Directive solvency ratio by the end of
2014, the Amsterdam-based company said in a statement today. Its
ratio, a measure of an insurer’s ability to absorb losses, stood
at 181 percent at the end of October, Delta Lloyd said.  Delta Lloyd announced its objective after European
politicians reached an agreement this month on rules to assess
the capital insurers need to set aside for future obligations,
while taking into account market volatility. The Dutch insurer
plans to increase solvency in part by generating capital
organically and disposing of non-core businesses, it said.  “We are well capitalized and confident about our solvency
position and prepared for future capital regimes,” Delta Lloyd
Chief Executive Officer Niek Hoek said in the statement. “Our
first priority is to bring IGD group solvency above the 200
percent ratio.”  Delta Lloyd will gradually reduce the 4 percent premium for
its stock dividend above the cash dividend once the IGD group
solvency exceeds 200 percent for two consecutive quarters, it
said. The company aims for operational costs of 730 million
euros ($985 million) for 2014 and 700 million euros for 2015, it
also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
