Catcher  Carlos Ruiz  agreed on a
three-year, $26 million contract to remain with the  Philadelphia
Phillies , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  Ruiz, a 34-year-old who’s played his entire eight-year
Major League Baseball career with the Phillies, also agreed on a
$4.5 million club option for a fourth season, the  newspaper said 
on its website, citing an unidentified person.  Ruiz’s .268 batting average last season was his worst since
2009. He missed the first 25 games of the season after testing
positive for the stimulant Adderal and finished the campaign
with five home runs and 37 runs batted in. A season earlier, he
was named an All-Star, batting .325 with 16 home runs and 68
RBI.  The World Series-champion Boston Red Sox and Colorado
Rockies were among the teams that had considered trying to sign
Ruiz, according to MLB.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
