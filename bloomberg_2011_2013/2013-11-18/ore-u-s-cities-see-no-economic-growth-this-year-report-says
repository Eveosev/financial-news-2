The economies in one third of U.S.
metropolitan areas will decline or stagnate this year, worse
than in 2012, according to a report prepared for mayors.  Of 363 areas, the economies in 119 will retreat or stay the
same, compared with 73 last year, according to the report,
released today by the Washington-based U.S. Conference of
Mayors.  The  U.S. economy  was hurt by automatic federal spending
cuts known as sequestration, along with a 16-day partial closing
of government, according to mayor’s group. Cities are still
recovering from the 18-month recession that ended in 2009, the
report said.  “We cannot afford manufactured crises like sequestration,
the debt ceiling battle and the federal government shutdown,”
said  Scott Smith , mayor of Mesa,  Arizona , and group president,
in a statement. “It is important that Washington not return to
dysfunction, which has real economic consequences in our
cities.”  Two-thirds of cities and surrounding suburbs will see their
economies grow, according to the report, which was prepared by
IHS Global Insight Inc. Midland,  Texas , topped the list, with
its economy expanding by 7.3 percent. Odessa, Texas followed at
6.4 percent.  In 2013, U.S. metropolitan areas will contain 86 percent of
total U.S. nonfarm employment, 90 percent of gross domestic
product, and 86 percent of the population, the study said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
