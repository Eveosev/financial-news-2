The U.S.  Supreme Court  let stand a
$111 million award won by SynQor Inc. in a patent-infringement
suit against nine makers of computer-system power converters,
including units of  Emerson Electric Co. (EMR)  and  ABB Ltd. (ABB)   The justices today turned away an appeal filed by the
defendants, leaving intact a jury verdict and appeals court
decision favoring SynQor, a manufacturer based in Boxborough,
Massachusetts.  The dispute involved safety features that control how much
electricity goes to large computer systems, as well as to
telecommunication and data communication equipment.  Under the judgment in the case, Emerson’s Artesyn and Astec
units had to pay $14 million of the award and ABB’s Power-One
unit more than $25 million. The companies also were told to pay
additional damages for infringement.  The case is Artesyn Technologies v. SynQor, 13-375.  To contact the reporter on this story:
