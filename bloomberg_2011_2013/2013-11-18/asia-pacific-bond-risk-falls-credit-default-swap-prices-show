The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index slid 1.5 basis points to
102 basis points as of 11:31 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The benchmark is on course for its lowest
close since May 22, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 1 basis point to 132 basis points
as of 8:23 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close
since Oct. 31, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index also decreased 1 basis point
to 84 as of 9:37 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show.
The index is on track for its lowest close since Sept. 19,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
