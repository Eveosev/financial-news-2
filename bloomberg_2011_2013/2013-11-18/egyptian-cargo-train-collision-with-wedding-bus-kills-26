An Egyptian cargo train hit a truck
and a minibus carrying people returning from a wedding, killing
at least 26, in the latest multiple-fatality accident to strike
the country’s railroad system.  The late night incident in the town of Dahshour also left
at least 28 injured, Ahmed El-Ansari, head of  Egypt ’s ambulance
service said by phone. Prosecutors have taken testimony from the
injured and witnesses, the state-run Ahram Gate news website
said.  The accident comes almost a year after another train
smashed into a school bus in southern Egypt, leaving at least 50
children dead. That and subsequent accidents spotlighted the
nation’s dilapidated railway infrastructure and served as fresh
fodder for criticism of then-President Mohamed Mursi, who was
ousted from power in July following a mass uprising.  The crash occurred as the train, which was carrying
construction materials, smashed into the vehicles ferrying
people from a wedding to their homes in the province of Fayoum,
Ahram Gate reported. The injured reported that on arrival at the
intersection, they were surprised to see no workers present and
that the crossing lights were off, the news website reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
