The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  will keep
the franc capped until 2015, according to a Bloomberg News
survey.  The ceiling of 1.20 francs per euro, which the Zurich-based
central bank set in September 2011 to stave off haven flows from
the euro area, will stay in place until after the first quarter
of 2015, according to 64 percent of 11 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Four economists expect the cap to be lifted in
2014, with another four seeing that happening in the following
year. One economist each expect a cap exit in 2016 and 2017 and
Attilio Bertini, head of research at Credito Valtellinese in
 Italy , doesn’t expect the SNB to take any action.  “In my opinion the euro-swiss cap at 1.20 is useless
already today and SNB will leave as a future backstop,” Bertini
said by e-mail.  The franc, popular at times of high aversion to risk, has
depreciated 2.1 percent against the euro this year, as the risk
of a break up on the currency union recedes. Less turbulence on
foreign-exchange markets has meant the SNB hasn’t intervened on
the franc in more than a year.  ECB Eyed  The SNB would be well advised to lift the ceiling on the
franc only once major central banks normalize policy, according
to Ernst Baltensperger, professor emeritus of economics at the
University of Bern.  The euro area’s nascent economic recovery lost momentum in
the third quarter and inflation slowed to the lowest level in
four years, leading the European Central Bank to cut its
benchmark rate to a record low earlier this month.  “Were Switzerland to venture an exit alone, it would run
the risk of a drastic appreciation,” Baltensperger said in an
op-ed for Neue Zuercher Zeitung published today. “However, the
point in time and form of such a normalization are completely
unclear.”  The SNB set the cap citing the risk of deflation and an
economic slump, as investors bought francs in a bid to safeguard
their assets amid the 17-member euro bloc’s debt crisis.  Since 2011, the Swiss economy has evaded a recession, in
contrast to the neighboring 17-member currency bloc, which
emerged from a record 18-month recession only in the second
quarter. Even so, price pressure remain weak and the central
bank sees no breach of its 2 percent price stability threshold
in coming years.  According to the poll, growth this year will average 1.8
percent, accelerating to 1.9 percent in 2014 and to 2 percent in
2015. That forecast is unchanged from a survey last month.  SNB Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine said on Nov. 14
that the cap remained an “essential instrument.” The SNB
predicts consumer prices will fall 0.2 percent this year, and
then rise 0.3 percent in 2014.  According to the survey, prices will fall 0.2 percent this
year. They expect an inflation rate of 0.5 percent next year and
1 percent in 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
