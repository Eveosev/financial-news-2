Emerging-market stocks rose for a
third day after  China  vowed to carry out the broadest expansion
of economic freedoms since at least the 1990s. The rupee led
gains in developing-nation currencies.  Citic Securities Co. and Haitong Securities Co. surged more
than 10 percent in Hong Kong as 18 of the top 20 gainers on the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index were Chinese companies. The yield on
China’s 10-year bond rose to the highest level since 2007.
 India ’s rupee strengthened the most in a month while Malaysia’s
ringgit rose for a third day.  The MSCI index jumped 1.2 percent to 1,017.43 at 2:33 p.m.
in Hong Kong, set for its highest close since Nov. 4. Chinese
leaders vowed to allow more private investment in state-owned
industries, loosen the one-child policy and expand farmers’ land
rights as the ruling Com party seeks to sustain growth in the
world’s second-biggest economy.  “China is a key driver of Asia and the global economy, so
the market is taking it positively,” Jeffrosenberg Tan, a fund
manager at PT Sinarmas Asset Management, which manages about
$600 million, said in Jakarta. “The measures are expected to
help China’s long-term economic growth.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  gained 2.4 percent, set for
the highest close since Oct. 22. The  Hang Seng China Enterprise
Index (HSCEI)  of mainland stocks listed in Hong Kong surged 5.3 percent,
the biggest advance since December 2011. India’s  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX) 
jumped 1.7 percent, the most in three weeks.  The emerging markets gauge has slid 3.6 percent this year
and trades at 10.7 times projected 12-month earnings. That
compares with the 21 percent jump in MSCI World Index, which is
valued at 14.6 times estimated earnings. All 10 industry groups
in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained, led by a 1.4 percent
increase in financial stocks. India’s rupee rallied 0.8 percent
to 62.635 per dollar.  Malaysia ’s ringgit added 0.2 percent.  IPO Reform  Chinese brokerages led the rally, with Citic Securities and
Haitong Securities surging to an eight-month high. China’s
government flagged policy changes that portend the end of a 14-month ban on initial public offerings by pushing forward reform
for a registration system on IPOs, according to a Nov. 15
statement posted on the government’s website.  The yield on Chinese government bonds due August 2023 rose
five basis points to 4.65 percent, according to prices from the
National Interbank Funding Center. The yuan was little changed
at 6.0919 per dollar. The currency has strengthened 2.3 percent
this year. China will accelerate convertibility of the  yuan  and
free-up of interest rates, improve treasury yield curves and let
qualified private investors set up small-to-medium sized banks,
