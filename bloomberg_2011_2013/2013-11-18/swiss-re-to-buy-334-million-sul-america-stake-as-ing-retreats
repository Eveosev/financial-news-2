Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-largest reinsurer, agreed to buy an 11 percent stake in  Sul
America SA (SULA11)  from  ING Groep NV (INGA)  to expand in  Brazil .  The reinsurer will also purchase a 3.8 percent holding in
Rio de Janeiro-based Sul America from members of the Larragoiti
family for a total of about $334 million, according to a
 statement  yesterday from the Zurich-based company.  “The acquisition shows Swiss Re’s commitment to high
market growth,”  Fabrizio Croce , an analyst with Kepler
Cheuvreux in Zurich, said in a note to investors. “The company
has so far been under-represented in the Brazilian reinsurance
market.”  Swiss Re has been looking to expand in high-growth markets
such as China, India and Brazil. In October, Chief Executive
Officer Michel Lies agreed to invest as much as $425 million in
Richard Li’s FWD Group. The deal announced yesterday will give
the reinsurer a stake in Brazil’s largest independent insurance
group. Sul America offers property, casualty and life insurance,
as well as pension and asset-management products.  Swiss Re rose 0.1 percent to 82.30 Swiss francs by 12:45
p.m. in Zurich trading, valuing the company at 30.5 billion
francs ($33.4 billion). The stock climbed 25 percent this year.
Sul America  advanced  0.8 percent to 15.95 reais ($7.05) in  Sao
Paulo  yesterday.  ‘Growth Opportunities’  “Sul America is a well established and successful
multiline insurer in Brazil where we see attractive growth
opportunities,” Swiss Re’s Lies said in the statement.  ING, forced to sell its entire insurance operations after
receiving state aid in 2008 and 2009, will get about 185 million
euros ($250 million) in the sale, and expects to book a gain of
about 100 million euros.  “ING is progressing well with its disposal program,”
JanWillem Knoll, an Amsterdam-based analyst at ABN Amro Group
NV, said in a note today. Following its restructuring, ING will
become a “relatively clean bank, focused on the more stable
northern European economies,” said the analyst, who recommends
clients buy the shares.  ING  shares  slipped 0.6 percent to 9.56 euros by 12:45 p.m.
in Amsterdam, paring their gain this year to 35 percent.  The transaction helps ING unwind a joint venture formed in
2002. Earlier this year, the Amsterdam-based company agreed to
sell a 7 percent stake to the Larragoiti family. Proceeds will
be used to pay down debt, ING said in a separate statement
yesterday. After both deals are completed, the Dutch company
will have a stake of 10 percent in Sul America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
