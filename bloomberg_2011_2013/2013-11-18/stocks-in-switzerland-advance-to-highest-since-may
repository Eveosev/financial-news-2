Swiss stocks  rose to an almost six-month high as investors speculated central banks won’t rush to
withdraw support to the economic recovery.  Sonova Holding AG rallied the most in a year after posting
first-half revenue that beat analysts’ estimates and raising its
financial targets. Swatch Group AG, Cie. Financiere Richemont SA
and  Nestle SA (NESN)  also advanced.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  rose 0.4 percent to 8,360.52 at 1:14
p.m. in Zurich, its highest level since May 22. The gauge
advanced 1.1 percent last week as Federal Reserve chairman
nominee  Janet Yellen  said she is committed to promoting a strong
U.S. economic recovery and will ensure monetary stimulus isn’t
removed too soon. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
climbed 0.4 percent today.  “We are still positive on growth,” Joost van Leenders,
who helps oversee about $645 billion as a strategist at BNP
Paribas from Amsterdam, said by phone. “We still think  Europe 
is relatively attractive but we need to see more earnings growth
to move further out. Equities will gain next year but it really
has to come from earnings.”  Economists in a Bloomberg survey estimate that policy
makers in the U.S. will wait until a March 18-19 meeting to
begin tapering bond purchases to $70 billion a month from $85
billion. The Fed’s decision to maintain the pace of stimulus has
helped the MSCI World Index jump 21 percent this year.  Sonova (SOON)  rose 6.9 percent to 126.40 Swiss francs, its biggest
jump since November 2012 and highest price since March 2011. The
hearing-aid maker said sales will probably rise 8 percent to 10
percent in local currencies in the 12 months through March,
compared with the earlier forecast of a 6 percent to 8 percent
gain.  The company also said earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization will probably advance 11 percent to 14 percent in
local currencies, compared with 9 percent to 13 percent
predicted previously.  Swatch climbed 2.3 percent to 596.50 francs, while
Richemont gained 0.4 percent to 93.05 francs. Nestle added 1.1
percent to 67.60 francs.  The SMI is trading at 16.23 times the projected earnings of
its constituents, higher than the five-year average of 13.19
times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
