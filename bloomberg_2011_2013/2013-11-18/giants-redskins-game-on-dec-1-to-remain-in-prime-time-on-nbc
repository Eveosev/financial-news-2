The  New York  Giants’ road game
against the Washington Redskins on Dec. 1 will remain the prime-time contest on NBC, the National Football League said.  The game between National Football Conference East division
rivals will maintain its scheduled 8:30 p.m. Washington time
kickoff at FedEx Field in Landover,  Maryland .  Both the Giants and Redskins have losing records this
season. Other games on Dec. 1 include a rematch of the once-beaten Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs, the New England
Patriots against the Houston Texans and the Miami Dolphins
against the New York Jets.  The NFL is allowed to change start times of games to give
Comcast Corp.’s NBC a better matchup for its Sunday prime-time
telecast. NBC is paying $1.1 billion for the Sunday night NFL
package.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
