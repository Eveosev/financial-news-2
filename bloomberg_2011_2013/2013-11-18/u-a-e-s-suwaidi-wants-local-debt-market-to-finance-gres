The  United Arab Emirates , the
second-biggest Arab economy, must develop local debt markets to
help large state-run and private companies find alternatives to
bank loans, Central Bank Governor Sultan Al-Suwaidi said.  “The development of a domestic debt market, in my view, is
of a national priority,” Suwaidi said at a speech in  Abu Dhabi 
today. “Companies, particularly, large private companies and
GREs, need an alternative to bank lending,” he said, referring
to government-related entities.  His remarks came a day after the central bank issued rules
setting caps on the exposure of banks to government, local
governments and GREs, in an effort to reduce risks to the
financial system. Some Dubai government-controlled companies
almost defaulted on debt in 2009 after borrowing billions of
dollar as the emirate aimed to transform itself into the
financial and business hub of the  Middle East .  The U.A.E., a federation of seven sheikhdoms, is the only
country in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council that doesn’t
have a domestic, local-currency debt market. The other members
of GCC are  Saudi Arabia ,  Kuwait , Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.  “Banks would also need instruments of the domestic debt
markets to fulfill the requirements of Basel III regarding
liquidity ratios,” Suwaidi said. “It’s necessary for the
U.A.E. now to expedite the issuance of the public debt law and
to set up the needed market infrastructure as a first step to
the way to a viable domestic debt market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
