German stocks  advanced for a third
day, with the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index rising to a record, as gains
in utilities offset Bayer AG’s decline.  RWE AG (RWE)  jumped 6.3 percent after Exane BNP Paribas upgraded
the country’s second-biggest utility. Daimler AG and Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG each rose 1.8 percent as a gauge of European
carmakers advanced.  The DAX gained 0.7 percent to 9,231.43 at 3:50 p.m. in
Frankfurt. The benchmark measure has surged 21 percent in 2013
as central banks around the world pledged to leave interest
rates low for a prolonged period. The broader HDAX Index also
added 0.7 percent today.  “Some asset managers that were waiting on the sidelines
for a correction in the market have seen that it hasn’t come, so
they have had to go back into the market,”  Robert Halver , head
of capital-markets research at Baader Bank AG in Frankfurt, said
in a telephone interview. “It has been difficult to break this
9,200 level over the past few weeks. The final target for the
DAX at the end of the year will be 9,500.”  RWE jumped 6.3 percent to 27.87 euros after Exane upgraded
the shares to outperform from neutral, increasing its projected
target price on the stocks to 32 euros from 26 euros.  “We are now feeling more reassured about earnings, debt
and dividend,” Exane analysts said. “We think power prices in
Germany have troughed and the group should benefit from a
favorable outcome to German nuclear litigation.”  EON SE,  Germany ’s biggest utility, advanced 4.3 percent to
14.08 euros. A gauge of utilities was among the best performers
of the 19 industry groups on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Carmakers Gain  Daimler, the world’s third-largest maker of luxury
vehicles, climbed 1.8 percent to 59.72 euros. BMW, the biggest
manufacturer, gained 1.8 percent to 82.99 euros. Volkswagen AG,
Europe’s largest carmaker, advanced 0.7 percent to 195.80 euros,
its highest price since at least 1992. A measure of auto-related
stocks rose the most on the Stoxx 600.  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  added 0.3 percent to 7.56 euros, paring
earlier gains of as much as 1.4 percent. UBS AG increased its
price estimate for the German pay-television provider controlled
by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp to 8.50 euros a share from 7.30
euros, citing its progress in restructuring and upgrading its
customer base.  To contact the reporter on this story:
