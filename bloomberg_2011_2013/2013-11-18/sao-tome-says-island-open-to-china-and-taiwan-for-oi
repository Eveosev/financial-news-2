Sao Tome and Principe is open to oil
exploration from Chinese and Taiwanese companies, as the African
island expands relations with the world’s second-largest
economy, Prime Minister Gabriel Costa said.  “Taiwanese companies are welcome to participate in oil
drilling due to the two nations’ long-term relations,” Costa
said in an interview in Taipei, referring to the diplomatic
relationship it has with  Taiwan . “It is open to everybody,
including  China .”  Trade between China and Sao Tome, an island of about
187,000 people, was $3.4 million last year, making China its
fifth-largest trade partner, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sao Tome’s largest partner is  Portugal , which claimed
the uninhabited island in the 15th century.  China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since
Nationalist party leaders fled to the island in 1949 during a
civil war with Communist forces. China considers Taiwan a
renegade province that it has pledged to unify, by force if
necessary. Taiwan’s Republic of China government, under
President Ma Ying-Jeou, adheres to the principle of a single
China, which Chinese and Taiwanese leaders interpret
differently.  Costa is visiting Taiwan to lure investors a week after
China opened a trade office in Sao Tome, a diplomatic ally of
Taiwan. Africa’s second-smallest country exports cocoa and has a
joint oil and gas exploration agreement with  Nigeria , located
about 308 miles north (496 kilometers).  To contact the reporter on this story:
