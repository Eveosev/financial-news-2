JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , the second-best performing Chinese solar manufacturer in the past year,
rose to a three-year high after increasing its shipment forecast
and posting a third-quarter profit.  Jinko’s American depositary receipts surged 13 percent to
$33.30 at the close in  New York , the highest since November
2010. The Shangrao, China-based company’s ADRs are each worth
four ordinary shares.  Jinko expects to ship 1.7 gigawatts to 1.8 gigawatts of
solar panels this year, up from an earlier forecast of 1.5
gigawatts to 1.7 gigawatts, according to a statement today.  Net income in the quarter was 103.5 million yuan ($16.9
million), compared with a loss of 114.5 million yuan a year
earlier. Income more than doubled from the second quarter, when
Jinko was the only profitable Chinese manufacturer in the
Bloomberg Global Large Solar Energy Index of 15 companies.  The company’s efforts to expand into developing solar farms
in addition to producing and selling panels is helping drive
profits, said Chief Executive Officer Chen Kangping.  ‘With the number and scale of our projects growing rapidly,
we expect that this revenue stream will contribute meaningfully
to our profit in the future,’’ he said today on a conference
call with analysts.  Jinko completed about 105 megawatts of solar projects
through Sept. 30, and expects to finish 108 megawatts of  power
plants  in the current quarter. Revenue rose 48 percent from a
year earlier to 1.96 billion  yuan .  The company’s ADRs have increased 10-fold in the past year,
the best performance on the Large Solar Index after Canadian
Solar Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
