PTT Pcl (PTT) , Thailand’s importer of
liquefied natural gas, bought four spot cargoes on an oil-linked
price formula, according to two people with knowledge of the
transaction.  The shipments are for December to March delivery, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. LNG price formulas linked to
crude, including Brent and the so-called Japan Crude Cocktail,
are usually used in long-term contracts that are typically more
than 10 years.  The state-owned company will also burn an additional 30,000
metric tons a month of  fuel oil  supplied locally to generate
power because LNG spot cargoes are expensive, one of the people
said.  The cost of LNG for delivery to Northeast  Asia  over the
next four to eight weeks increased to $18.10 per million British
thermal units, New York-based Energy Intelligence Group said on
the website of its World Gas Intelligence publication on Nov.
