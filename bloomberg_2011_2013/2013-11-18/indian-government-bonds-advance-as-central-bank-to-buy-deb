Indian  government bonds  due 2027
rose on optimism the central bank’s plan to buy sovereign debt
will spur demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will buy 80 billion rupees ($1.3
billion) of securities today, Governor  Raghuram Rajan  said at an
 unscheduled press conference  on Nov. 13 after the yield on
 benchmark notes  due in a decade climbed to a three-month high.
 Wholesale prices  rose 7 percent in October from a year earlier,
the fastest pace since February, official data showed Nov. 14.  “We are just seeing some softening in yields after the
recent increase,” said N. Srinivasan Venkatesh, head of
treasury at IDBI Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Overall, there is a bias
for yields to go up, given the inflation scenario.”  The yield on the 8.28 percent bonds due September 2027 slid
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.09 percent as
of 10:19 a.m. in Mumbai, prices from the central bank’s trading
system show. Trading in the 7.16 percent notes due May 2023 was
suspended today due to semi-annual interest payments, according
to Development Credit Bank Ltd. and IDBI Bank.  Consumer-price inflation  accelerated to 10.09 percent in
October from 9.84 percent in the previous month, and  industrial
production  increased 2 percent in September, official reports
showed Nov. 12. Rajan said Nov. 13 that he would carefully look
at data, including on food prices and exchange-rate
depreciation, before deciding whether to raise the benchmark
repurchase rate for a third consecutive meeting.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell two basis
points to 8.60 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Indian
financial markets were shut Nov. 15 for a local holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
