Misawa Homes Co. had the biggest
drop in nine months in Tokyo trading after the Japanese builder
said cases of defective construction by its units were found.  Shares of Misawa Homes dropped as much as 8.9 percent to
1,504 yen, the biggest fall since Feb. 12 and were down 3.3
percent at 1,596 yen as of 10:52 a.m., local time. The stock has
gained 26 percent so far this year, compared with the 39 percent
advance by the 96-member Topix Construction Index.  Construction may not have been completed to specifications
at 1,619 homes at three of its units, the company said in a
statement dated Nov. 15 on its  website . The defective homes were
found at units in Chugoku area and Saga prefecture, both in
western parts of  Japan , and Hokkaido, north of the main Honshu
island, it said.  “The biggest problem is reputation,” said  Yoji Otani , a
Tokyo-based real estate analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.
“Homebuyers may avoid Misawa Homes in the short term.”  Misawa’s finding comes prior to the government’s plan to
raise the consumption tax to 8 percent from 5 percent next
April. Housing starts rose to an annualized 1.04 million units
in September, the highest since September 2008, a land ministry
report showed last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
