The thermal coal market will remain
in surplus next year as producers fail to cut shipments in
response to the glut and Chinese inventories of the power-station fuel increase, according to Citigroup Inc.  “The fundamental oversupply in the market will push prices
back lower in 2014, particularly as we move beyond the beginning
of the year,” the bank said, forecasting coal at  Australia ’s
Newcastle port, the Asian benchmark, will average $79 a metric
ton next year.  Citigroup maintained its forecast for Newcastle coal to
average $85 a ton in 2015. The bank increased its estimate for
the first quarter of next year by 2.5 percent to $82. The fuel
has  averaged  $85.26 this year, according to data from
globalCOAL.  Supply reductions have been muted in Australia, the world’s
second biggest exporter, because producers are locked into long-term rail freight and port deals, which are required to finance
the export infrastructure, Citigroup said. Under the agreements
known as take-or-pay contracts, suppliers must pay a fee
regardless of whether the coal is shipped. Producers from
Australia to the U.S. have cut workers and shelved projects as
slumping prices and escalating costs reduce profits.  Coal inventories in  China , the world’s biggest energy user,
have climbed at mines, ports and power plants, and demand is
projected to weaken as tighter credit conditions slow industrial
growth, Citigroup said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
