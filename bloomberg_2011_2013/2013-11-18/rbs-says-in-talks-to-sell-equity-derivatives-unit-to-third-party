Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
the British lender scaling back its investment bank after
receiving a government bailout, said it’s in talks to sell its
equity derivatives and structured retail investor products unit.  “No agreement has been entered into and there is no
certainty that an agreement will be reached,” RBS said in a
statement today. “A further announcement will be made as
appropriate.”   The statement didn’t identify the bidder. The Edinburgh-based lender is poised to sell its structured products portfolio
to France’s  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , Structured Products Magazine
reported last week, citing unidentified people with knowledge of
the matter. The Paris-based lender beat bidders including  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , the magazine reported.  Rebecca Nelson, a spokeswoman for RBS, and Ilias Catsaros,
a spokesman for BNP Paribas in London, declined to comment.  RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, said in
June it would exit all structured retail investor products and
equity derivatives.  The bank  has about 50,000 structured
products outstanding such as certificates tied to commodities,
currencies, equities, interest rates and proprietary indexes,
according to its website.  Derivatives are a type of security whose price is dependent
upon or derived from underlying assets such as stocks, bonds,
commodities and currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
