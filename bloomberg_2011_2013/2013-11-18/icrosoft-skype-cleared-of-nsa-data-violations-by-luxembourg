Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and its Skype unit
were cleared of privacy violations related to the U.S. spying
scandal by a Luxembourg regulator that said the companies didn’t
provide widespread data access to the U.S. National Security
Agency.  The Luxembourg data protection regulator’s probe concluded
that the transfer of some data to affiliate companies in the
U.S. “appear to take place lawfully” under a so-called safe
harbor agreement, according to a statement by the watchdog
today.  The regulator conducted the investigation because the
companies have their European headquarters in the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
