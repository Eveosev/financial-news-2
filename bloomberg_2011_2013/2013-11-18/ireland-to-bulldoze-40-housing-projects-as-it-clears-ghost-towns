The Irish government will bulldoze
about 40 housing projects over the next year as the country
continues to repair damage created by western  Europe ’s worst
real estate crash.  The empty properties, known as ghost estates, are among
about 1,300 unfinished developments remaining in the country,
according to a spokesman for the Irish Department of the
Environment. The country had about 2,800 abandoned projects in
2010, said the spokesman, who asked not to be named in line with
government policy.  Thousands of Irish projects ground to a halt after the
property bubble burst in 2007, plunging developers into
bankruptcy and leading the government to take a 67.5 billion-euro ($91 billion) bailout. More than one in 10 Irish houses are
vacant, not including holiday homes, the country’s central
statistics agency estimated last year.  The government and local authorities are working to deal
with the remaining 1,300 sites, the spokesman said. The estates
being demolished were found to have no viable financial future,
the spokesman said. He declined to name the lenders who provided
financing for the estates.  The Sunday Times first reported on the proposed demolitions
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
