CFM International , the  General
Electric Co. (GE)  engine venture with  Safran SA (SAF) , plans to lift output
by more than 10 percent by 2019 as it seeks to satisfy growing
demand from  Boeing Co. (BA) , Airbus SAS, and  China ’s Comac.  Production, due to exceed 1,500 turbines for the first time
this year, will reach 1,700 in six years, CFM Executive Vice
President Chaker Chahrour said at the Dubai Air Show. Output may
rise further if Airbus follows Boeing’s lead in stepping up
single-aisle plane output, and CFM can reach 1,800 engines
without significant investment, he said.  CFM International is the exclusive engine provider for
 Boeing 737  and Comac C919 and competes for orders with the Pratt
& Whitney-led International Aero Engines joint venture on the
 Airbus A320 . Boeing announced plans to boost 737 output 24
percent to 47 jets per month by 2017, with Airbus considering a
move beyond a build rate of 42 planes.  “We have looked at rate 50 and above,” Chahrour said.
“We will be ready to get there if that materialized.”  Order intake at CFM this year is already 21 percent above
last year’s level, said Jean-Paul Ebanga, the joint venture’s
chief executive officer. Bookings topped 2,360 engines at the
end of last month, compared with 1,972 for all of 2012.  Sales of both the current CFM56 powerplant and the Leap,
which is still in development and will power future narrow-bodies, are ahead previous year’s level.  The engine maker booked orders at the Dubai Air Show from
Etihad Airways PJSC to power A320neos and will provide the
powerplants for FlyDubai’s order of as many as 111 737s,
including 100 of the new Max version in a deal valued at $2.6
billion. Lufthansa today will also place an order to power 30
A321s in a deal valued at $610 million at list price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
