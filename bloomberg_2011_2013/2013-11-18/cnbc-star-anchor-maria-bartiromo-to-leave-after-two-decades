Maria Bartiromo, who helped pioneer
cable-television coverage of business news, is leaving CNBC
after two decades.  Bartiromo’s contract with her longtime employer, owned by
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , expires Nov. 24, the company said today in an e-mailed statement. The Drudge Report said Bartiromo, 46, will
join rival Fox Business Network. Caley Cronin, a Fox Business
spokeswoman, had no immediate comment.  Bartiromo’s star power could help  21st Century Fox Inc. (FOXA) ’s
Fox Business catch up to CNBC in the ratings. Fox Business
averaged 46,000 viewers over the past 12 months, compared with
an average audience of 135,000 for CNBC for the same period,
according to Nielsen data supplied by Brad Adgate, researcher
for Horizon Media Inc.  “Her contributions to CNBC are too numerous to list but we
thank her for all of her hard work over the years and wish her
the best,” Brian Steel, a spokesman for CNBC, said in the
statement.  Both networks compete with Bloomberg Television, owned by
Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
