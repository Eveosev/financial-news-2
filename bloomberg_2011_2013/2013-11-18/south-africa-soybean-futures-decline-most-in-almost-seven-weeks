South African soybean futures
declined the most in almost seven weeks.  The oilseed for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 1.8 percent, the biggest decline since Oct. 1, to
6,250 rand ($619) a metric ton by the noon close on the South
African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. Wheat for delivery
next month slipped for a fourth day, losing 0.4 percent to 3,530
rand a ton. White corn retreated 0.6 percent to 2,413 rand a
ton, while the yellow variety decreased 0.5 percent to 2,361
rand.  South Africa , a net importer of wheat, is the sub-Saharan
region’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia  and the
area’s biggest buyer after Nigeria and Sudan, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data. The country is the biggest
grower of corn, with the white variety used as a staple food and
yellow used mainly as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
