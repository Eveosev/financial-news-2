The University of  Alabama  and
Florida State remain the top two teams in college football’s
Bowl Championship Series standings for the third straight week,
while Baylor pulled closer to No. 3 Ohio State.  Two-time defending national champion Alabama improved its
record to 10-0 with a 20-7 win over Mississippi State on Nov.
16. The Crimson Tide has a .991 rating out of 1.000 in the BCS
standings, which determine the two teams to play for the
national title on Jan. 6 in  Pasadena , California.  Florida State is also 10-0 after a 59-3 rout over Syracuse
two days ago, the same score by which the Seminoles beat Wake
Forest a week earlier. The Seminoles have a BCS rating of .966,
with a dropoff to Ohio State (10-0) at .887.  Baylor (9-0) moved up one spot to fourth at .886 after a
63-34 win over Texas Tech coupled with Stanford’s 20-17 loss to
the University of Southern  California . Stanford (8-2) dropped
five spots to ninth in this week’s BCS standings.  The University of Oregon (9-1) is the highest-rated one-loss team at No. 5, followed by Auburn (10-1), Clemson (9-1) and
Missouri (9-1). Oklahoma State (9-1) rounds out the top 10 of
the BCS standings, which are determined by the Harris
Interactive Poll, the USA Today coaches’ poll and an average of
six computer rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
