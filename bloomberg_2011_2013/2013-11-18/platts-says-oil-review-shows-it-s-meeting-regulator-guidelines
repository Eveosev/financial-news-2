Platts, an energy news and price
publisher, said its reporting practices and governance policies
comply with guidelines set out by international regulators.  The company’s procedures align with principles set out by
the Madrid-based International Organization of Securities
Commissions, a group of national market regulators from more
than 100 countries, Platts said in an e-mailed statement today.
The conclusion follows an independent review by Ernst & Young
that examined Platts’s price assessment processes, including
those for oil, at its offices in London, Houston and  Singapore .  “The results of the review confirm that Platts sets – and
meets – high standards for price reporting,” Larry Neal,
president of Platts, said in the statement. “Clearly defined
and transparent methodologies are the heart of Platts’
assessment processes.” Platts is a unit of  McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. (MHFI)   European Union antitrust authorities raided the offices of
companies including Platts, BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and
Statoil ASA in May amid allegations of collusion and price
manipulation in crude, refined products and biofuels markets.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , competes with
Platts and other companies in providing energy markets news and
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
