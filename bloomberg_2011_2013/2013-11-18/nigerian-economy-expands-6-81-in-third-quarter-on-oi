Nigeria’s economic growth quickened
in the third quarter as the oil industry’s contraction eased and
agricultural output increased.  Gross domestic product  rose 6.81 percent on an annual
basis, the fastest pace this year, compared with 6.18 percent in
the second quarter, the Abuja-based National Bureau of
Statistics said in an e-mailed statement today.  While disruptions to Nigerian oil exports continued in
 Africa ’s second-largest economy, daily average crude oil
production rose to 2.26 million barrels from 2.11 million
barrels in the previous quarter. Crude output declined from 2.52
million barrels a day in the third quarter of 2012.  “Supply disruptions continue to hamper output in the oil
sector,” the statistics bureau said.  Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country with more than 160
million people, depends on crude exports for about 80 percent of
government revenue and the industry accounts for about 12.5
percent of gross domestic product.  Criminal gangs tapping oil from pipelines for illegal sale
have posed the biggest threat to output since a government
amnesty in 2009 reduced armed attacks led by rebels fighting for
greater control of the region’s resources.  Three “major” pipelines began pumping again between July
and September, which were “welcome developments for crude
production going forward,” the statistics bureau said.  Oil Slump  The oil and natural gas industry shrank 0.53 percent in the
third quarter, compared with a 1.15 percent slump in the second
quarter, while agricultural output rose 5.08 percent from 4.52
percent. Investments to boost dry-season farming, supply seeds
and fertilizers directly to farmers and provide mechanized
equipment at affordable prices helped to increase farming
production, according to the statistics bureau.  Non-oil industry expansion was 7.95 percent in the third
quarter from 7.36 percent between April and June, it said.  The naira gained 0.4 percent to 158.75 per dollar by 10:29
a.m. in Abjua, heading for its biggest advance in six weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
