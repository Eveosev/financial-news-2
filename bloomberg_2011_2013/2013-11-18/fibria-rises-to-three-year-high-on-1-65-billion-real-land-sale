Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) ,  Brazil ’s largest
pulpmaker, jumped to a three-year high after announcing a 1.65
billion-real ($722 million) land sale that will help the company
cut debt.  The shares climbed 4 percent to 30.21 reais at 12:19 p.m.
in  Sao Paulo , the highest since November 2010 on a closing
basis. It was the biggest  gainer  on the MSCI Brazil/Materials
Index, which advanced 2.9 percent.  The company sold 210,000 hectares of land in the states of
Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Bahia and Espirito Santo to
Parkia Participacoes SA, according to an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  “We are positive on this news,” Citigroup Inc. analyst
Juan Tavarez wrote in a research note to clients. “It
accelerates de-leveraging and the potential return to investment
grade.”  Fibria, which has been trying to regain its investment
grade status since 2009, lowered its ratio of net debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to 2.9 times in the third quarter from 4.2 times in the year-ago
period, according to its earnings  presentation .  The Sao Paulo-based company will receive an initial payment
of 1.4 billion reais on the closing of the contract, which is
expected by Dec. 30, and will use the sale proceeds to pay debt
maturing from 2014, Chief Financial Officer Guilherme Cavalcanti
said today on a conference call.  To contact the reporters on this story:
