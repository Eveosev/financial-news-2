Washington Post Co. (WPO)  is becoming
Graham Holdings Co., assuming the name of its controlling family
after the $250 million sale of its eponymous newspaper.  The company will also change its ticker symbol to GHC on
Nov. 29, it said today in a statement. The company closed its
sale of the Post to  Jeff Bezos , chief executive officer of
Amazon.com Inc., on Oct. 1.  The new moniker cements Post Co.â€™s transformation into a
holding company with investments in education, television,
social media and industrial products. The company agreed in July
to acquire Forney Corp., which makes gas and oil igniters, to
expand beyond the media business.  Chairman and CEO  Donald Graham  and his family control the
company through its non-trading Class A shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
