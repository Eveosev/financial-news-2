OneWest Bank FSB , the lender
formerly known as IndyMac Bancorp Inc., plans to pay a $1
billion dividend to backers including  George Soros  and  John
Paulson  ahead of an initial public offering next year, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  The payout, which regulators still have to approve, would
return most of the money a group invested in OneWest as it
acquired IndyMac from the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  in
2009, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the plans are private. The dividend could also improve the
Pasadena, California-based return on equity by trimming excess
capital, the people said.  OneWest Chief Executive Officer Steve Mnuchin raised $1.55
billion to acquire IndyMac after the FDIC seized the subprime-mortgage lender in July 2008. OneWest returned at least $500
million to the investor group in a dividend paid in the fourth
quarter, according to a letter that Paulson sent in January to
investors in his firm, Paulson & Co. Dell Inc. founder  Michael
Dell  and private-equity fund manager J. Christopher Flowers also
own stakes in OneWest.  The lender tried to find a buyer earlier this year and held
informal talks with companies including UnionBanCal Corp. and
U.S. Bancorp, people familiar with the matter said in February.
It is now preparing for an IPO, two people said.  David Isaacs, a spokesman for OneWest, declined to comment
yesterday as did  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros Fund
Management LLC. Spokesmen for Paulson, MSD Capital LP, which
helps manage Michael Dell’s personal fortune, and JC Flowers &
Co., didn’t return phone calls seeking comment.  Bank Turnaround  IndyMac’s is the second largest U.S. commercial bank
failure on record, behind the collapse of Washington Mutual
Inc., according FDIC data. OneWest, which has acquired two other
failed lenders in  California  since it was established, had
assets of $25 billion at June 30, up from $16 billion in 2009.
Its branches have more than doubled.  Its turnaround prompted protests outside of the home of CEO
Mnuchin, with critics alleging the bank profited at the expense
of homeowners. Mnuchin has said the allegations stem from a
misunderstanding of the terms of the IndyMac deal.  The bank, which primarily makes home loans, reported $183
million in net income for the first six months of 2013, a 14
percent increase from a year earlier, according to the FDIC. It
had $4.2 billion in equity as of June.  OneWest’s return on equity, a measure of how efficiently a
company uses shareholders funds, was 8.9 percent in the first
six months of 2013, FDIC data show. That compares with an
average of 10.4 percent for the average bank with at least $10
billion in assets, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
