Advent International agreed to
acquire  Unit4 NV (UNIT4)  for about 1.15 billion euros ($1.6 billion), a
deal that will allow the Dutch software maker to continue its
expansion outside  Europe .  Unit4 investors will get 38.75 euros in cash for each share
they hold in a deal supported by both management and supervisory
boards, the companies said in a joint statement. That’s 10
percent more than the stock’s Nov. 15 close in Amsterdam. Unit4
jumped as much as 8.7 percent today.  The takeover by Advent, a private-equity firm, will
accelerate Unit4’s transition into a provider of enterprise
software as a service, said Chris Ouwinga, its founder, who owns
5.6 percent of the software company. Unit4 now has 85 percent of
its business in Europe, and Advent’s support will help it expand
outside the region.  “We feel that in the future, a substantial part of the
growth will come from outside Europe, areas like  Asia  and  Latin
America ,” Ouwinga said in a phone interview today. “We have a
presence in those areas, but we think we should continue to grow
in those areas and that requires a lot of capital.”  The offer memo is expected to be published during the first
quarter next year, with the deal closing during the first half,
said Ouwinga.  ‘Fair Price’  The transaction values Unit4 at 12.8 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared with a
median of 15.3 times for its peers, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The company, based in Sliedrecht,  Netherlands , has
29.7 million shares outstanding, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Ouwinga said Advent’s bid was the highest received.  “This seems like a straightforward bid and the price is
pretty fair,” said Hans Slob, an analyst at Rabobank
International. “The multiple seems pretty high so I see a low
probability for a higher bid.”  Advent’s planned purchase of Danish  software company  KMD
A/S in October last year is still pending. The Boston-based
buyout firm completed the 1.15 billion-euro purchase of 90
percent of  France ’s Oberthur Technologies in 2011. Ouwinga said
Advent has the experience to help Unit4 through its transition
and help with its growth plans.  Unit4 soared 55 percent this year through Nov. 15, giving
the company a market value of 1.04 billion euros. The shares
traded 8.4 percent higher at 38.05 euros as of 10:42 a.m. in
Amsterdam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
