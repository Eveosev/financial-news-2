Michelin added a pair of new two-star restaurants in  Belgium , praising the standard of cooking in
the country and in Luxembourg.  The winners are chef Christophe Hardiquest for Bon-Bon, in
Brussels, and Bart Desmidt for Bartholomeus, in Knokke-Heist.
There are 18 new single stars in Belgium: 12 in Flanders, two in
Brussels and four in Wallonia. One of those recognized is Villa
Lorraine, which regains its award in the capital. Becher Gare in
Luxembourg is also recognized.  “The Michelin guide to Belgium & Luxembourg selection
reveals the vitality of a gourmet dining scene in both countries
that is increasingly open, constantly evolving and never fails
to take advantage of new influences,” Europe’s largest tiremaker
said today in an e-mailed release.  Michelin & Cie. produced its first guide in 1900. It was
free of charge until 1920 and intended for chauffeurs. The
volume contained practical information, including street maps
and tips on repairing tires.  The company is based in Clermont-Ferrand,  France .  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
