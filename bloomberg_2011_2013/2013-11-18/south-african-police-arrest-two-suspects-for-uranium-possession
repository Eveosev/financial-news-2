Two men suspected of possessing
uranium will today appear in a court in  South Africa ’s eastern
port city of Durban, the police said.  Officers arrested two foreign nationals on Nov. 14 after
the suspects tried to find a buyer for a package they claimed
contained the radioactive metal, South African Police Service
spokesman Jay Naicker said today by phone. The package was
handed to the South African Nuclear Energy Corp. for it to test
the authenticity of the content, Naicker said.  “I can’t recall any other case where someone was trying to
sell uranium,” Naicker said. “It could be something else so we
need to test it.”  Uranium is usually sold as an oxide concentrate, a powder
form known as yellowcake, according to the  World Nuclear
Association . Before it can be used in a reactor for electricity
generation, it must undergo a series of processes. Nuclear
energy generates about 11 percent of  the world’s power, and
global demand for the material is forecast to increase 48
percent over the next decade, the WNA said.  In South Africa the metal is mainly mined as a byproduct of
gold extraction.  The men will also face charges for the possession of 90
ecstasy tablets, Naicker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
