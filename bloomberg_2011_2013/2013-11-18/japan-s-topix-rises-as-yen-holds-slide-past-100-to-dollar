Japan ’s Topix index rose for a third
day, after last week closing at its highest since May, as
financial  shares  advanced. Dwango Co. surged.  Consumer-finance firm Aiful Corp. jumped 5.8 percent as
brokerages, consumer lenders, insurers and banks were among the
 best-performing  Topix subsectors. Dwango soared 17 percent for a
second day of gains after video-game console maker Nintendo Co.
bought a stake in the mobile-content company. Baby-care product
makers Pigeon Corp. and Unicharm Corp. gained at least 4.2
percent as  China  pledged to relax the nation’s one-child policy.  The Topix added 0.2 percent to 1,241.67 at the close in
 Tokyo  after falling as much as 0.1 percent. About equal numbers
of shares rose and fell, with volume 15 percent above the 30-day
average. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average was little changed at
15,164.30. The gauge jumped 7.7 percent last week, its biggest
weekly increase since 2009. The yen weakened past 100 per dollar
last week and traded at 100.08 today.  “Generally speaking the environment surrounding Japanese
shares is good,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at
Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees
about 11 trillion yen ($110 billion). “There are no big
negative catalysts. That said, the yen hasn’t changed from last
week’s level of 100 per dollar and there are no new positive
factors, either.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent today. U.S. stocks capped a sixth straight week of gains
on Nov. 15, with the S&P 500 rising 0.4 percent to a record,
after  Janet Yellen  signaled she will continue Federal Reserve
stimulus efforts if she is named the bank’s next chairman.  May Peak  The Nikkei 225 surged 80 percent from November 2012 to its
highest close in 5 1/2 years on May 22 amid bets Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  will lead the country out of
deflation. The gauge then slumped 20 percent through June 13 to
enter a  bear market , before recovering to close last week at its
highest since the May peak.  Japanese stocks are poised to surpass this year’s high set
in May as a stronger  U.S. economy  weakens the yen and Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s reflation policy leads to wage increases,
according to BNP Paribas Investment Partners SA and SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc.  As earnings season draws to a close, net income doubled at
more than 1,280 of the country’s largest listed non-financial
firms, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Companies that
made tough decisions about exiting businesses, closing factories
and revamping management led corporate earnings last quarter to
the highest level since 2007.  Financial Stocks  Financial shares advanced today. Aiful, a consumer lender,
jumped 5.8 percent to 474 yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Japan’s
largest brokerage, added 0.9 percent to 797 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., the nation’s second-biggest bank, climbed
1.8 percent to 5,170 yen. Insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.
rose 2.4 percent to 3,460 yen.  Dwango soared 17 percent to 2,638 yen, the highest close
since July 9, after surging 21 percent on Nov. 15. Nintendo said
last week it bought 612,200 shares in the company. The
investment was made at the request of Dwango Chairman Nobuo Kawakami for his personal funding needs, Nintendo spokesman
 Yasuhiro Minagawa  said on Nov. 15. Dwango was the most traded
Topix stock by value today. Nintendo slid 0.2 percent to 13,040
yen today after climbing 5.2 percent on Nov. 15.  Baby-product makers gained after China pledged to relax its
one-child policy as part of the biggest package of economic
reforms since the 1990s. China’s Communist Party said it will
allow couples to have two children if either parent is an only
child. Currently couples are allowed to have a second child if
both parents are only children. Pigeon jumped 7.1 percent to
5,150 yen, while Unicharm rose 4.2 percent to 6,520 yen.  Rakuten Surges  Among other shares that rose,  Skymark (9204)  Airlines Inc.
advanced 9.2 percent to 357 yen. Skymark, which has a market
value of about 33 billion yen, will be moved from the TSE
Mothers Market of smaller shares to the Tokyo Exchange’s first
section of larger stocks on Nov. 22.  Rakuten Inc. (4755) , which operates an e-commerce site, jumped 9
percent to close at 1,499 yen after touching a record high.  A gauge tracking aviation stocks fell the most among the 33
industry groups. Japan Airlines Co. slipped 1.5 percent to 5,430
yen. ANA Holdings Inc. slid 1.4 percent to 211 yen.  Shares on the Topix traded at 1.26 times  book value  today,

600 Index on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
