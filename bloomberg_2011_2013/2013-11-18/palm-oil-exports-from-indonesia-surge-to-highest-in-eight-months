Palm oil shipments from  Indonesia ,
the world’s largest producer, climbed to the highest level in
eight months in October as a decline in supplies of substitute
oils in India and  China  spurred demand from the biggest buyers.  Exports increased 13 percent to 1.86 million metric tons
from 1.64 million tons in September, the Indonesian Palm Oil
Association, said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s the
highest since 1.92 million tons shipped in February and compared
with 1.42 million tons in October 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments beat the median estimate of 1.7
million tons in a Bloomberg survey published Nov. 12.  Increased demand for palm oil, used in everything from
candy to cosmetics, amid a drop in output due to heavy rains,
may help extend a rally in prices. Futures in Kuala Lumpur
entered a bull market this month and are heading for their first
annual gain in three years on concern that production in
Indonesia and  Malaysia , the top growers, may trail estimates.  “Unpredictable weather conditions in some countries have
benefited and improved demand for palm oil,” the growers and
refiners group known as Gapki said in the statement. Heavy rains
may disrupt harvesting and reduce production in Indonesia and
Malaysia this month, supporting prices, it said.  Palm oil will probably gain to $975 a ton this month, said
Gapki, without providing details of which price it referred to.
Futures fell 1 percent to 2,586 ringgit ($809) a ton on Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives in Kuala Lumpur by 12:30 p.m. local time.  India and China lifted purchases because of low domestic
vegetable oils output and an increase in food and biofuel
consumption, Gapki said.  Exports to  India  rose 13 percent to 488,260 tons in October
from a month earlier, Gapki said. Shipments to China surged 62
percent to 296,490 tons, while sales to European Union countries
jumped 52 percent to 395,380 tons, it said.  Shipments in the first 10 months of the year rose 20
percent to 17.2 million tons from year earlier, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
