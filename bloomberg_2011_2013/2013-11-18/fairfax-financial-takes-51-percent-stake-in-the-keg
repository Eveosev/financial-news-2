Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) ,
that led a $1 billion investment in BlackBerry Ltd., bought half
of Keg Restaurants Inc. as it shakes up its restaurant
portfolio.  The Toronto-based insurer acquired 51 percent of The Keg’s
shares from Chief Executive Officer David Aisenstat, according
to a statement. Aisenstat will continue to hold 49 percent of
the company and will remain in operational control of the
Vancouver-based chain. Financial details were not released.  “Fairfax will bring additional expertise and resources to
The Keg,” Aisenstat said in the statement.  Fairfax bought Prime Restaurants Inc. for C$53  million  ($51
million) in January 2012 and last month sold it to Cara
Operations Ltd., the country’s largest full-service restaurant
company that owns Harvey’s and Swiss Chalet.  The Keg steak house chain has more than 100 restaurants in
 Canada  and the U.S with sales of about C$500 million, according
to the statement. The Keg Royalties Income Fund which owns the
rights to the restaurant, including its name and trademarks,
 returned  65 percent in the three years through Nov. 15,
including dividends. That compares with a 16 percent gain in the
Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index over the same time frame.  The deal will close in January 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
