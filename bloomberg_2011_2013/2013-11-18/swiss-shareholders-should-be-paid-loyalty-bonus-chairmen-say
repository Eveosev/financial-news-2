Swiss companies should reward
investors willing to hold their shares for at least three years
to encourage loyalty, according to the chairmen of  Clariant AG (CLN) 
and  Leonteq AG. (LEON)   Long-term investors should be paid a “sustainability
premium” in the form of a special dividend, said Rudolf Wehrli,
64, chairman of Muttenz, Switzerland-based chemicals maker
Clariant AG, at a conference in Zurich today.  “We all wish for long-term investors,” Wehrli said.
“It’s not buy and hold anymore, but take the money and run,”
as more investors focus on short-term performance, he said.  The average holding period for shares in Switzerland is
seven to eight months, Peter Forstmoser, 70, former chairman of
 Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-biggest reinsurer, said at the
conference. Forstmoser is chairman of holding company Leonteq
and Zug, Switzerland-based real estate management company Hesta
AG.  A loyalty premium could make it more attractive for pension
funds and life insurers to invest longer term, Forstmoser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
