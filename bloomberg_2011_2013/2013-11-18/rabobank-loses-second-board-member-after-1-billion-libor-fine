Rabobank Groep, said commercial-banking chief Sipko Schat will step down, the second board
member to leave after the Dutch lender was fined 774 million
euros ($1 billion) for rigging interbank lending rates.  Schat, 53, will depart immediately after the local lenders
that own Rabobank withdrew their backing for him, the Utrecht,
Netherlands-based bank said in a statement today.  The bank , a co-operative formed in 1898 to lend to farmers,
last month received the second-highest fine levied by global
regulators over the manipulation of  interest rates . Schat, who
oversaw the division which made submissions to the London
interbank offered rate, remained in his post after Piet Moerland
stepped down as chairman following the fine.  “We lose a top international banker, a well-esteemed
colleague who has contributed a great deal to Rabobank,” Rinus Minderhoud, who last month succeeded Moerland as chairman, said
in the statement.  Rabobank made more than 500 attempts to change Libor,
according to regulators. Thirty current and former employees
were involved, Schat said when the bank was fined. Five were
fired, he said, while 14 are still working for the company.  Global regulators have fined  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,  ICAP Plc (IAP)  and Rabobank about $3.7
billion for distorting Libor and similar benchmarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
