Canadian  stocks  fell, after the
benchmark index reached a two-year high, as a drop in commodity
shares offset an advance among banks.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  and Eldorado Gold Corp. retreated at

banks still have to report,” said Michael O’Brien, a  fund
manager  with TD Asset Management Inc. in Toronto. He helps
manage about C$216 billion ($207 billion) with the firm. “The
biggest thing is people will continue to watch the macro data as
the Fed has said for a few months their decisions will be data
dependent. The big fear of investors is the Fed beginning
tapering too early.”  Equities rallied this year as the U.S. Federal Reserve
embarked on a monthly $85 billion bond-buying program to
stimulate the economy. Fed policy makers will probably scale
back the pace of asset purchases at their March 18-19 meeting,
according to the median of 32 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
economists on Nov. 8.  Foreign Buyers  Foreign purchases of Canadian equities hit a four-year high
in September as investors sought to take advantage of a stock
