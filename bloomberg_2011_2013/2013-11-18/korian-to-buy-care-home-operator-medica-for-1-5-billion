Korian (KORI)  agreed to buy Medica SA for
1.1 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in a deal that will create the
largest French operator of nursing homes.  Medica holders will receive Korian stock valued at about
23.01 euros a share, the companies said in a statement today.
That’s 15 percent above Medica’s closing price Nov. 15 in Paris.  The combination, which Korian and Medica described as a
merger of equals, will create a stronger company better able to
expand geographically, they said. The resulting company will
have 57,164 nursing home beds  Europe , including in  France ,
Germany and Italy, the companies said.  Orpea SA (ORP) , France’s
biggest care-home operator, has 40,374 beds, according to the
company’s website.  Korian Chief Executive Officer Yann Coleou will be CEO of
the combined company, while his counterpart, Jacques Bailet,
will be chairman. Christian Chautard, the chairman of Paris-based Korian, will become chairman a year after the merger.  Medica holders will receive about 0.91 of a Korian share
for each Medica share. The transaction is subject to approval by
France’s antitrust regulator. Special shareholder meetings for
both companies are planned in the first quarter of next year to
vote on the deal.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole SA and
Bredin Prat advised Korian, while Medica received advice from
Credit Suisse Group AG and  Cleary Gottlieb .  Medica, based in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, rose 0.7
percent to close at 20.03 euros Nov. 15. Korian fell less than
0.1 percent to 25.31 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
