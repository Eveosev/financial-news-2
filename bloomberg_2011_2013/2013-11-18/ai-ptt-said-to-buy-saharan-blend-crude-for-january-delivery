Thailand ’s  PTT Pcl (PTT)  bought via tender
1 million barrels of Algerian Saharan Blend crude from BP Plc
for Jan. 1 to Jan. 5 delivery, according to two people who
participate in the market.  The cargo traded at a premium of about $5 a barrel to Dated
Brent, the people said, asking not to be identified because they
aren’t authorized to speak to the media.  It will be shipped to IRPC Pcl’s 215,000 barrel-a-day
Rayong refinery. State-owned PTT holds a 38.5 percent stake in
the refiner and petrochemical maker, the unit’s  website  shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
