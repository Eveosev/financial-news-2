K+S AG (SDF) ,  Europe ’s largest potash
supplier, had its  dividend forecast  cut by Bloomberg analysts
after the German company said it wasn’t sure the payout ratio
could be maintained.  The company based in Kassel probably will pay 85 euro cents
a share from 2013 profit early next year, the analysts said
today in a note. That’s a reduction from their outlook of 1 euro
previously, and from the 1.40-euro annual dividend K+S paid on
2012 profit.  Chief Executive Officer Norbert Steiner on Nov. 14 told
analysts that “a temporary deviation from our dividend policy
cannot be ruled out,” according to an earnings conference call
transcript. The company’s custom to pay about 40 percent to 50
percent of profit as a dividend couldn’t be assured “because of
the uncertainty of the market for potash and magnesium products
and financing measures that are necessary,” he said.  K+S and competitors have suffered in recent months from
global price declines for the crop nutrient used by farmers to
strengthen plant roots.  Adjusted  earnings per share  at the supplier are forecast to
decline 24 percent this year to 2.148 euros a share, according
to the average of 25 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
