Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  will encrypt all
information that flows between its data centers, beefing up
security efforts after new reports of spying on digital content
by the National Security Agency.  The Sunnyvale, California-based company will also let users
encrypt data to and from Yahoo by the end of the first quarter
of 2014, Chief Executive Officer  Marissa Mayer  said in a  blog
post  today. The NSA has tapped fiber-optic cables overseas to
siphon data from Yahoo and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , according to an Oct. 30
report in the Washington Post. Mayer reiterated in her post that
Yahoo has “never given access to our data centers to the NSA.”  Yahoo, owner of the largest U.S. Web portal, is
strengthening security as it seeks to reassure customers that it
is protecting user privacy so they remain active on its sites.
The encryption, which scrambles data using a mathematical
formula that can be decoded only with a special digital key,
comes after Google said it was stepping up similar efforts with
information moving between its data centers.  “As we have said before, we will continue to evaluate how
we can protect our users’ privacy and their data,” Mayer said
in the post. “We appreciate, and certainly do not take for
granted, the trust our users place in us.”  Yahoo earlier had said it would make more-secure encrypted
connections standard by January for e-mail users. The company
also will work closely with international e-mail partners to
ensure user accounts are enabled with more protective controls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
