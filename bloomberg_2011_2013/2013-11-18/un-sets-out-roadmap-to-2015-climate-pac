The United Nations proposed a
roadmap to a climate agreement, clarifying some of the steps
some 190 nations must take to reach by the end of 2015 to reach
a deal binding all countries to reduce greenhouse gases.  Envoys aim to develop “the elements of the negotiating
text” for the planned 2015 deal in time for their next major
conference in  Lima  next December 2014, according to draft
conclusions today on the website of the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change.  Negotiators from almost 190 nations are involved in
two weeks of UN talks that end Nov. 22 in Warsaw.  The text calls out for scaling up of finance from
industrialized to poorer nations to help them cut emissions and
fight the effects of global warming. It also charts elements of
the eventual deal, including emissions pledges that nations will
determine themselves, the establishment of a global goal to help
countries adapt to climate change, and reinforcing efforts to
share emissions-reducing technology.  “This draft is workable though not comprehensive,”
Bangladeshi envoy Quamrul Chowdhury, a lead negotiator for the
bloc of 48 so-called Least Developed Countries, said today in an
e-mail. “It lacks some clarity on the roadmap, which we
negotiators have to flesh out this week.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
