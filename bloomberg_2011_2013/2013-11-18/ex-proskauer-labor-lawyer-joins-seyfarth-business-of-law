Jackson Lewis LLP said Fraser A. McAlpine, Hunton & Williams LLP’s former California labor and
employment head, joined the firm and will become managing
partner of its San Francisco office on Jan. 1.  McAlpine will take over the management post from Bradley W.
Kampas, who will return to his practice full-time. McAlpine was
formerly the managing partner of Hunton & Williams’ San
Francisco office.  “He brings a wealth of substantive experience,
particularly with employment class actions, which will enhance
our robust practice in San Francisco and take it to a new and
exciting level,” Jackson Lewis Chairman Vincent A. Cino said in
a statement.  McAlpine’s practice involves wage-and-hour claims,
employment discrimination class actions and unfair business
practice litigation, according to his former firm’s biography.
He also represents and counsels management in disputes related
to pensions, executive compensation, employee raiding and
misappropriation of  trade secrets .  Jackson Lewis has 765 attorneys at 54 offices in the U.S.
and Puerto Rico.  Ex-Proskauer Labor Lawyer Lawrence Lorber Joins Seyfarth Shaw  Lawrence Lorber, the labor lawyer who headed Proskauer Rose
LLP’s Washington employment practice, joined Seyfarth Shaw LLP.  Lorber has also worked as deputy assistant secretary of
Labor and director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs.  “Larry is one of the nation’s leading authorities on the
intersection of employment law and policy,” Lisa Damon, the
chairwoman of Seyfarth’s labor and employment department, said
in a statement. “Working closely with both Republican and
Democratic administrations, he has helped implement a number of
laws which continue to shape today’s labor and employment
landscape.”  Lorber counsels and represents employers on labor and
employment matters including equal employment opportunity
topics, affirmative action, Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs and Labor Department audits, wages and
hours, employment aspects of corporate mergers and acquisitions,
employee discipline and the preparation of employee handbooks
and human resource policies.  He also advises clients on government contract issues, as
well as congressional and regulatory matters.  Seyfarth Shaw has more than 800 attorneys and offices in
the U.S., London, Shanghai and Australia.  Akin Gump Hires Former California State Assembly Majority Leader  Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP said Dario J. Frommer,
formerly of Mayer Brown LLP, joined the firm as a partner in Los
Angeles, where he will lead the firm’s California public law and
policy practice.  Frommer, a former majority leader of the California State
Assembly, also was chairman of its Health Committee and was
appointments secretary to Governor  Gray Davis .  His practice is a mix of political advice and
representation of clients before state and local government
entities, including rulemaking, regulatory enforcement, bids,
bid protests and investigations. His experience includes energy,
 climate change , health care, tribal gaming, government
procurement and election law, the firm said.  “California is both a major economic driver for the nation
as well as the state with the largest congressional
delegation,” Kim Koopersmith, the firm’s chairwoman, said in a
statement. “As such, our clients will benefit tremendously by
gaining access to Dario’s knowledge and experience.”  Akin Gump has more than 850 attorneys at offices in the
U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East.  Pryor Cashman Gets U.S. Prosecutor Alberts as White-Collar Head  Jeffrey Alberts joined Pryor Cashman LLP as a partner and
chairman of its white-collar defense and investigations
practice. He previously worked in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan.  His practice will focus on government investigations and
prosecutions, and related regulatory proceedings, asset
forfeiture litigation, victims’ rights representation, and
complex civil litigation, the firm said. Alberts will also
support the firm’s art-law practice because of his experience
with asset forfeiture.  “As result of increased government oversight, there is a
thorny brier of regulations that require deft skill to
understand and navigate,” Ronald H. Shechtman, Pryor Cashman’s
managing partner, said in a statement. “Jeff brings to our
clients an insider’s perspective that is a perfect complement to
our current capabilities.”  Alberts won a Justice Department award for his work in the
asset forfeiture proceedings against  Marc Dreier . He was also
recognized for his work in the forfeiture of more than $500
million in proceeds from the fraud at Refco Inc.  Pryor Cashman has more than 130 attorneys at offices in New
York and Los Angeles.  Litigator Rothell Joins Morris Manning in Washington  Morris, Manning & Martin LLP hired partner Bonnie Hochman
Rothell along with an associate and paralegal for its Washington

managing partner, said in a statement.  Rothell has been practicing law for more than 25 years,

avoidance. She also specializes in creditors’ rights and
bankruptcy matters, representing both lenders and borrowers.  Morris Manning has offices in Atlanta and Savannah,

Washington, as well as an alliance with FGCN in Sao Paulo.  News  Law Firm Unfinished-Business Bid Sent to New York Appeals Court  The New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in New
York State, will be deciding whether a bankrupt  law firm  is
entitled to profit from the hourly fees in unresolved client
matters that departing lawyers have taken with them to new
firms.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  in Manhattan referred the
question to the New York Court of Appeals in a case involving
the defunct firm Thelen LLP. U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III ruled in September 2012 in Thelen’s bankruptcy
liquidation that hourly fees earned on unfinished business at a
new law firm don’t belong to the defunct firm.  Earlier that same year, in the liquidation of Coudert
Brothers LLP, U.S. District Judge  Colleen McMahon  said fees
earned on unfinished business belong to the liquidated firm.  Both cases were appealed.  The U.S. Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Nov. 15 referred
the question in Thelen’s case to the New York Court of Appeals.
On issues governed by state law, federal courts must determine
how the state’s highest court would probably rule if there isn’t
already a definitive answer.  The ruling from the New York Court of Appeals, while not
binding outside the state, will be persuasive because both
partnership law and ethics laws are similar throughout the U.S.  The answer will also determine whether lawyers from Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP, which also went bankrupt, must disgorge profit on
unfinished hourly business.  For more, click here.  Ex-Morgan Stanley Director McKnight Said Up for NBA Union Chief  Riche T. McKnight, a partner at Winston & Strawn LLP and a
former  executive director  in the  Morgan Stanley (MS)  litigation
department, is among the candidates to succeed ousted NBA
Players Association chief  Billy Hunter , two people with direct
knowledge of the search said.  The people were granted anonymity because the process isn’t
public. McKnight declined to comment in a telephone interview.  McKnight was extensively involved in litigation arising
from the financial crisis, including that pertaining to subprime
mortgages and collateralized debt obligations, according to his
law firm biography.  He was also part of a team that represented individual
National Basketball Association players in antitrust litigation
against the league and its clubs, and advised baseball’s  Los
Angeles Dodgers  in their bankruptcy, according to the bio.  The union hired Reilly Partners, a Chicago-based executive
search firm, in September to find a replacement for Hunter.  Allison Mack, a Reilly Partners spokeswoman, said in a
phone interview that the firm wouldn’t comment on the search.
Teri Washington, a spokeswoman for the players union, didn’t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment on McKnight.  Jeffrey Kessler , the union’s outside counsel, is a partner
at Winston & Strawn. He declined to comment on McKnight, who
received his undergraduate degree in public policy from  Duke
University  and his law degree from the  University of Virginia .  Hunter was fired amid allegations of nepotism and abuse of
union resources. Player representatives from 24 of the 30 teams
voted unanimously in February to remove Hunter, ending the
former federal prosecutor’s 16-year tenure. He was making $3
million annually.  His dismissal ended almost a year of speculation about his
future with the association, punctuated by an audit conducted by
New York-based Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP. The
review concluded that, while Hunter did nothing illegal, he
failed to manage conflicts of interest, lacked proper corporate
governance and didn’t disclose that his contract wasn’t properly
ratified.  The union hasn’t given a timetable to name a replacement.
Ron Klempner, the New York-based association’s deputy general
counsel, is serving as active executive director.  White Says SEC Ready for More Trials Prompted by Admissions Push  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is prepared for
a potential increase in trials resulting from its move to seek
tougher settlements from defendants, the agency’s chairman said.  Mary Jo White said in Washington Nov. 14 that the SEC
welcomes the prospect of more trials, which can enhance public
accountability by airing “a full factual record of
wrongdoing.” White cited similar reasons when she announced in
June that the SEC would seek admissions of wrongdoing in more
settlements of its enforcement cases.  “Some have asked whether the agency’s trial lawyers are
ready to go up against the best of the white-collar defense
bar,” White, a former U.S. attorney and litigator, told an
audience at the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. “It will
probably come as no surprise to you, but my answer is a
resounding yes, we are prepared to do that.”  The SEC has obtained admissions of wrongdoing in several
enforcement cases since White made her June announcement. Her
policy of seeking admissions of wrongdoing marked a change from
the practice of regularly settling cases by allowing defendants
to neither admit nor deny fault.  The regulator has obtained admissions of wrongdoing in
settling cases against defendants  Philip Falcone  and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  Falcone, a hedge-fund manager, was accused of
improperly borrowing money from his fund to pay his personal
taxes and giving preferential treatment to some of his investors
in returning their money. JPMorgan admitted in September that it
violated securities laws when it failed to catch London-based
traders hiding losses in 2012.  “I altered the policy because I believe that in certain
cases, more may be required for a resolution to achieve public
accountability and to be, and viewed to be, a sufficient
punishment to send a strong message of deterrence,” White said.
“Not a trial, but some extra measure of public
accountability.”  Firm News  Pierce Atwood Absorbs Rhode Island Firm Little Bulman  Little Bulman Medeiros & Whitney PC, a construction law and
business dispute resolution firm, is joining Pierce Atwood LLP
in December. The combined firm, operating as Pierce Atwood, will
have about 145 attorneys at offices in Maine, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Washington and Stockholm.  “We are very excited to have the attorneys of Little
Bulman join us,” Gloria Pinza, managing partner of Pierce
Atwood said in a statement. “Their exceptional credentials in
the construction law arena will combine with our strong
construction practice to create a regional practice that will
provide highly competitive expertise, depth and value throughout
New England and beyond.”  DeWitt Ross Joins Forces With Minnesota’s Mackall Crounse  Wisconsin-based DeWitt Ross & Stevens SC announced a
combination with the 26-attorney Minnesota firm of Mackall,
Crounse & Moore PLC to create a firm with more than 100
attorneys.  The Minneapolis office will operate as DeWitt Mackall
Crounse & Moore SC. The Wisconsin offices will continue as
DeWitt Ross & Stevens. The firm’s management structure will
continue in its current form with Bradley W. Raaths of DeWitt
Ross & Stevens as managing partner and president.  Mackall has corporate, banking, tax, estate planning,
mining and litigation practices, the firm said in a statement.
DeWitt Ross & Stevens has corporate, environmental, government
relations, labor and employment, litigation and intellectual
property practices.  “Our expansion into the Twin Cities region is strategic
and will allow us to offer enhanced legal services to new and
existing clients in both regions, while maintaining the high
quality of legal services and cost-effective rates we currently
offer,” Raaths said in the statement.  Litigation  Chevron Adversary to Testify He Didn’t Commit Fraud in Ecuador  A Manhattan lawyer who’s spent his career battling  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  over pollution in Ecuador is set to defend the tactics he
used to win a multibillion-dollar judgment against the company
before a federal judge.  The attorney, Steven Donziger, is scheduled to take the
stand today in a Manhattan trial over Chevron’s allegations that
Ecuadorean plaintiffs secured their 2011 victory through
bribery, fraud and coercion. The misdeeds amounted to a
racketeering and extortion plot, the  San Ramon , California-based
company said in its lawsuit against Donziger, who joined the
Ecuador case in the 1990s and became its lead adviser.  In a draft of written testimony Donziger made public, he
denied wrongdoing and said the pollution judgment “represents a
profound historical accomplishment of indigenous and farmer
communities in securing justice for wrongs inflicted upon them
by one of the most powerful corporations on the planet.”  Donziger said he drew upon his skills in “advocacy for the
disadvantaged,” and believed it was important to wage the
Ecuador case through the media, through protests and by speaking
directly to influential people.  The goal in the case “was never to politically influence
the legal process, but to safeguard that process from corrupt
activities on behalf of Chevron,” Donziger said in the prepared
testimony.  Chevron is seeking an order barring the plaintiffs from
trying to enforce a $19 billion judgment won in Ecuador in 2011
on behalf of rain-forest villagers living in the country’s Lago
Agrio region. The award was cut in half by the Ecuadorean
National Court of Justice on Nov. 12. Chevron has refused to pay
any of it.  Donziger’s testimony is scheduled in a nonjury trial that
began last month before U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  as the
lawyer seeks to refute claims he and Ecuadorean associates
exploited corruption in the country’s judiciary, bribed a judge,
and ghostwrote an expert report and the court ruling against
Chevron.  A Harvard Law School graduate, Donziger has pursued the
pollution claims against the second-largest U.S. energy company
with an intensity that inspired some writers to compare him to
the Bible’s  David and Goliath  tale and  Moby Dick ’s  Captain Ahab .  Throughout much of the case, Donziger worked out of his
Manhattan apartment, raising money from financing partners and
plotting strategy while Ecuadorean lawyers handled the
litigation.  A team of about 15 lawyers and law students helping with
the racketeering trial is living and working out of a three-bedroom apartment in lower Manhattan they call their “war
room.”  Chevron, made part of the litigation through its purchase
of Texaco, contended its predecessor cleaned up its share of the
damage under agreements with Ecuador, and that Petroecuador,
Texaco’s state-owned partner, was responsible for most of the
pollution.  The racketeering case is Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 11-cv-00691, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  For more, click here.  SAC Asked Analyst Horvath About Insider Trading, U.S. Says  SAC Capital Advisors LP compliance officers and the firm’s
outside lawyers questioned Jon Horvath in 2011, when he was an
analyst at the firm, about  insider trading  with expert networker
John Kinnucan and the firm Primary Global Research LLC, U.S.
prosecutors said.  While Horvath didn’t make any false statements, he was
“not forthcoming” about his involvement in any insider-trading
scheme during two separate sessions with SAC compliance officers
and Martin Klotz, an outside attorney for the fund, prosecutors
said in a letter to the court.  Horvath, who worked at SAC’s Sigma Capital Management LLC
unit, was first charged with being part of an insider-trading
ring by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in February 2012. Horvath pleaded guilty in
September 2012 and agreed to cooperate with the U.S. He will be
a witness against his former boss, SAC fund manager Michael Steinberg.  Kinnucan, the founder of Broadband Research LLC, pleaded
guilty in July 2012 to obstruction of justice and passing
illegal tips to hedge-fund clients about technology companies.  “The government presently intends to elicit at trial that,
while Horvath did not make any false statements during those
interviews, he was not forthcoming about his involvement in the
insider-trading scheme to which he subsequently pleaded
guilty,” assistant U.S. attorneys Antonia Apps and Harry Chernoff wrote to the judge.  Apps and Chernoff said that the government has learned from
Horvath that he was questioned by SAC’s compliance team, Klotz
and other lawyers at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP.  SAC pleaded guilty on Nov. 8 to insider trading. U.S.
District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan said she hasn’t
decided whether to accept the  Stamford , Connecticut-based hedge
fund’s plea.  Barry Berke, a lawyer for Steinberg, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message left at his office seeking comment
about the letter.  The cases are U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), and U.S. v.
SAC Capital Advisors LP, 13-cr-00541, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
