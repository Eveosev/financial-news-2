CDC Group Plc, a development finance
institution owned by the U.K. government, agreed to invest $25
million in an Indian renewable-energy developer.  CDC will provide the funds to Green Infra Ltd. to help
expand its wind and solar capacity, the London-based private
equity fund said in an e-mailed statement.  The CDC investment is part of a $125 million financing
round that will allow Green Infra to more than double its
portfolio to 1,000 megawatts by 2016, it said.  Green Infra owns 387 megawatts of capacity, about 90
percent wind-based. The New Delhi-based developer was set up by
IDFC,  India ’s biggest financier of clean-energy projects, in
2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
