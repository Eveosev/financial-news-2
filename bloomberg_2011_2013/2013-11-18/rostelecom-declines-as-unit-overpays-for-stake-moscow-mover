OAO Rostelecom fell for a fourth day
as a unit of  Russia ’s state-run telecommunications operator paid
more than the market price for a stake in the parent company.  The stock declined as much as 1.2 percent before paring its
loss to 0.6 percent at 116.36 rubles by 6:38 p.m. in Moscow.
Rostelecom’s preferred shares dropped 0.3 percent to 78.28
rubles. Russia’s benchmark gauge climbed 1.1 percent to
1,510.77, the highest level on a closing basis since Nov. 1.  Rostelecom said after the market closed on Nov. 15 its
subsidiary Mobitel bought a 7.45 percent stake in the parent
company for 25.2 billion rubles ($775 million). That translates
into a price tag of about 127 rubles a share, an 8.5 percent
premium to the close on Nov. 15, according to Bloomberg
calculations. On Oct. 11, Kremlin-backed Russian Direct
Investment Fund and Deutsche Bank AG said they purchased about
72.2 million shares of Rostelecom for 106.6 rubles a share,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  “The stock is falling because the company is losing money
without a reason in this transaction,” Alexander Vengranovich,
an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by phone from
Moscow. “This isn’t a very transparent deal.”  RDIF and Deutsche Bank bought Rostelecom’s shares for 7.7
billion rubles, according to an Oct. 11 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
