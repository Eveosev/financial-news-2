Last week, I met with a few of the crack Bloomberg Data Visualization folks. I got to see some of the  skunk works  projects that are in development. While I am a longstanding fan of “chart porn” and interactive digital media, this was real next level, Area 51-type stuff. Way, way cool.  As an example, have a look at this video I whipped together  earlier today .  Pretty wild stuff.  One of the things I am most excited about is working with this crew to bring some interactivity to financial and economic data. Nothing is imminent, but come Q12, I think we are going to have a few interesting surprises.  See also: Bloomberg Industry Leaderboard
