Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s
Onexim Group reached an agreement with Suleiman Kerimov and his
partners to buy their 33 percent stake in potash producer OAO
Uralkali, three people with knowledge of situation said.  The deal values the world’s largest producer of the soil
nutrient at about $20 billion, the people said, asking not to be
identified before an official statement. The stake held by
Kerimov and his partners has a market value of about $5.2
billion. OAO Uralchem owner Dmitry Mazepin may join Onexim as a
partner in the deal, two of the people said.  A sale may defuse a dispute between Russia and Belarus
sparked by Uralkali’s July withdrawal from a partnership that
marketed 40 percent of global potash exports. The falling-out
and Uralkali’s plan to boost production roiled the $20 billion
market for the soil nutrient. Belarus has called for a change in
the company’s ownership before a reconciliation is possible.  Anton Averin, a spokesman for Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva,
declined to comment, as did Andrey Belyak, an Onexim spokesman,
and Alan Basiev, a Uralchem spokesman.  The new owners will have a 38 percent stake in Uralkali
once the company fulfills a plan to cancel about 12.4 percent of
its stock held as treasury.  Uralkali climbed 7.6 percent to $27.74 in  London  on Nov.
