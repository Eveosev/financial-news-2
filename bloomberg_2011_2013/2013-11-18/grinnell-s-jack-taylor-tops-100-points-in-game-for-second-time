Jack Taylor, a junior guard at
Grinnell College who last year broke college basketball’s 58-year-old single-game scoring record with a 138-point game, had
109 yesterday in his second game of the season.  It was the third-highest single-game scoring effort in
National Collegiate Athletic Association history, trailing only
his record performance on Nov. 20, 2012, and a 113-point game by
Clarence “Bevo” Francis of Division II Rio Grande in 1954.  The 5-foot-10 Taylor hit  35-of-70 shots  yesterday,
including 24-of-48 from three-point range, as Division III
Grinnell routed Crossroads College 173-123 in Grinnell,  Iowa .
Taylor added 15 free throws on 17 attempts as the Pioneers
improved their record to 2-0. Crossroads fell to 0-9.  “Just like last year, I couldn’t have done this without my
teammates,” Taylor said in comments on the school’s website.
“I give so much credit to them -- this truly was a team effort.
I’m thankful for the program and the people I have playing
around me.”  Kyle Parker was Grinnell’s second-leading scorer with 15
points yesterday.  Crossroads College  of Rochester,  Minnesota , an associate
member of the National Christian College Athletic Association,
hit 73.8 percent of its shots, yet attempted only seven three-pointers. Grinnell shot 47.2 percent and made 30 of 79 three-point attempts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
