Siemens AG (SIE)  won wind-turbine orders
from Dong Energy A/S for two wind farms in the German North Sea.  Siemens will supply 97 of its 6-megawatt machines to Dongâ€™s
Gode Wind 1 and Gode Wind 2 projects, the Munich-based company
said today in an e-mailed statement. It will also service the
turbines for five years, it said, without disclosing terms.  Construction is scheduled to begin in the first half of
2015 and the projects are due to start operating in the second
half of 2016, Siemens said. They will eventually generate power
for 600,000 German homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
