Jailed Chinese political activist
 Liu Xiaobo , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, is appealing
his conviction for subversion, his lawyer said.  Liu gave approval to his wife Liu Xia to entrust his
lawyers to file the appeal last week, lawyer Mo Shaoping said
today by phone. Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison in late
2009 after he helped organize Charter 08, a letter signed by
more than 300 Chinese academics, lawyers and activists calling
for direct elections and freedom of assembly.  Asked if the appeal of the verdict against Liu would be
successful, Mo said: “I don’t want to predict this.”  “He believes that fundamentally he is not guilty and this
is a wrong judgment,” Mo said.  Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for his long and
non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in  China ,”
according to a statement by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in
Oslo. China protested the decision to award him the prize.  A Beijing court rejected Liu’s appeal of his sentence in
February 2010, the  Associated Press  reported at the time. Liu’s
wife is under house arrest in Beijing, the AP reported in June.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
