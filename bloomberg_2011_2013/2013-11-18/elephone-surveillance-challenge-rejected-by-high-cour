The U.S.  Supreme Court  turned away a
challenge to the Obama administration’s spying practices,
leaving intact an order that required  Verizon Communications
Inc. (VZ)  to turn over records of its customers’ domestic phone
calls.  The justices today said they won’t hear arguments from the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, which argued that a
national-security court exceeded its authority by ordering
Verizon to provide the call data.  The case represented the Supreme Court’s first opportunity
to review the surveillance program since former government
contractor Edward Snowden began releasing information about the
extent of data and communications swept up by the National
Security Agency.  EPIC, as the Washington-based privacy group is known, faced
a high hurdle in its bid for Supreme Court review because it
took the unusual step of filing its complaint directly with the
 high court . In urging the justices not to intervene, the Obama
administration pointed to similar suits that have been filed at
federal trial courts.  EPIC, a Verizon customer, challenged an April 2013 order
issued by a judge on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court. The order centered on “metadata” -- call logs showing
phone numbers, time and duration.  The case is In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center,
13-58.  To contact the reporter on this story:
