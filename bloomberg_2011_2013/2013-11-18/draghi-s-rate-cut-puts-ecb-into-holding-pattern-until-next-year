Mario Draghi  won’t follow his unexpected interest-rate cut with new liquidity injections into the financial system next month, economists say.  While a majority in a Bloomberg survey say the  European Central Bank ’s most probable next move is a measure such as long-term loans, 77 percent of those see it happening in the first or second quarter of 2014. Just 9 percent see Draghi taking action in December.  The ECB’s surprise policy move this month, which most respondents in the survey said was warranted, took the  benchmark rate  to a record low of 0.25 percent. That’s sparked speculation among economists and investors how far policy makers are prepared to go if inflation, already less than half of the ECB’s target, slows further, or the  economic recovery  weakens.  “The ECB wants to understand the effect the rate cut has had on liquidity, on credit growth and on monetary aggregates,” said Matteo Cominetta, European economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in  London . “If the effects are not significant, they will go for a new LTRO. I think they will have to act again.”  New Measures  ECB officials are drawing up plans to keep money flowing to banks to head off a liquidity squeeze when the first round of emergency long-term loans comes due in early 2015. A technical committee asked by Draghi to consider solutions met last month, according to two euro-region central bank officials familiar with the matter.  New liquidity measures could comprise longer-term refinancing operations with fixed or floating rates, different maturities or rules on how banks must use the cash. Other possible measures include changes to reserve or collateral requirements or suspending liquidity-absorbing operations.  The ECB already extended its policy to provide banks with as much liquidity as they need until mid-2015. Draghi said on Nov. 7 that officials are “ready to consider all available instruments” to ensure money-market conditions don’t hamper the transmission of the bank’s expansionary policy to companies and households.  Deflation Specter  In the Bloomberg survey of 37 economists, 60 percent forecast that the ECB’s next move will be a liquidity injection. A further 8 percent see a liquidity measure coupled with a rate cut. Eight percent also predict a cut in the main rate alone, with the same percentage seeing a negative deposit rate. Two economists said the ECB would implement quantitative easing.  The survey also showed 22 of the economists agreed that this month’s rate cut was warranted, with the remainder disagreeing, and 27 said Draghi’s forward guidance since July that the ECB would keep rates at or below current levels has been effective.  “For the ECB’s monetary policy to have any traction it has to go to the next level,” said  Steven Barrow , an economist at Standard Bank Plc in London, who did not participate in the survey. “The bank has shown it can be innovative with monetary policy. It has helped to save banks with its LTROs and save sovereign bonds with its OMT. The next challenge is to save the euro zone from the scourge of deflation.”  Asset Purchases  ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet told the Wall Street Journal that policy makers are ready to consider all options to ensure  price stability . While he said that additional stimulus isn’t needed at the moment, asset purchases could be deployed.  “If there should be a need for further measures, yes, we do have number of measures in the arsenal,” ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny told reporters in Vienna today.  Inflation (ECCPEMUY)  in the 17-nation euro area slowed to 0.7 percent in October, the lowest level in four years. The region’s economy came close to a halt in the third quarter as German growth slowed,  France’s economy  unexpectedly shrank and  Italy  extended its record recession.  The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey is for the economy to expand 0.2 percent this quarter and 0.3 percent in the first three months of 2014. After an expected contraction of 0.4 percent in 2013, the survey projects growth of 1 percent next year. In a separate survey last week, economists forecast U.S. growth of 2.6 percent in 2014.  On the ECB’s main rate, the median forecast is for it to remain unchanged until at least the second quarter of 2015.  Cut Opposition  The Bundesbank said today the ECB’s accommodative policy stance is appropriate.  “Given expected low inflation rates over the medium term and weak economic developments, an expansive bias in monetary policy in the euro area is currently justified,” it said in its monthly report. It added it’s “essential to keep an eye on the medium- and long-term risks of very low  interest rates .”  At the Nov. 7 ECB meeting, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann,  Germany ’s representative on the ECB Executive Board,  Joerg Asmussen , and members from countries traditionally aligned with the country’s conservative policy stance were against the rate cut, two central bank officials said. The opposing minority comprised as much as a quarter of the Governing Council.  “It’s no secret -- there was a discussion whether it was the right time for this action or not,” Nowotny said today.  Policy makers left the deposit rate, the rate for commercial lenders who park excess cash at the central bank, at zero after they signaled that the effects of taking it into negative territory can’t be adequately predicted.  On the one hand, the move could encourage banks to lend money to companies and households instead of keeping it at the ECB. However, it could also hamper their profitability as they may not be able follow the ECB into negative terrain. As a result, the spread between the rate banks charge for loans and the amount they pay depositors gets compressed.  Yet officials aren’t ready to exclude the option.  “ Euro-zone  economic prospects remain weak and inflationary pressures low; consequently, the ECB will remain under significant pressure to ease monetary policy again,” said Duncan De Vries, an economist at NIBC Bank NV in The Hague. “Although the ECB can still cut policy rates somewhat further and provide additional liquidity to the markets, we should be prepared for everything going forward.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Andre Tartar in London at  atartar@bloomberg.net ; Jana Randow in Frankfurt at  jrandow@bloomberg.net   To contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Stirling at  cstirling1@bloomberg.net ; Joshua Robinson at  jrobinson37@bloomberg.net
