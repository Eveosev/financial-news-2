Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  hired Clark Hutchison, formerly of Morgan Stanley, as the head of U.S.
listed derivatives, according to an e-mailed statement from
Europeâ€™s largest investment bank by revenue.  Hutchison will report to Ajay Singh, the global head of
listed derivatives, in New York, according to the statement.
Hutchison had been the global head of futures at Morgan Stanley
for four years, and before that global head of futures at UBS
AG.  Oksana Poltavets, a spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based
bank, declined to comment. Deutsche Bank co-Chief Executive
Officer Anshu Jain said last month he wants the bank to remain
one of the biggest fixed-income and derivatives traders globally
as competitors pull back.  To contact the reporter on this story:
