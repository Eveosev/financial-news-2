European banks should give investors
more information about the bad debt on their books, the Europe
Union’s top markets regulator said, as lenders prepare for a
series of regulatory reviews looking at financial risks.  Around a third of the 39 banks examined by the  European
Securities and Markets Authority  didn’t provide enough
information on unpaid loans, the agency said. Lenders should
also disclose more information on how they renegotiate terms
with borrowers struggling to repay their loans, and how they
hedge sovereign debt holdings with derivatives to give a more
accurate picture of credit risks, ESMA said in a report today.  The  European Central Bank  will take on oversight of the
region’s financial system to prevent a repeat of the turmoil
that set off the euro area’s worst recession since World War II.
The ECB will examine banks’ balance sheets and how risky they
are during 2014. The European Banking Authority will then help
conduct a series of stress tests.  Accurate financial disclosures “play a key role in
maintaining both investor and market confidence, which in turn
contributes to financial stability and promotes sound economic
growth,” Steven Maijoor, chairman of ESMA, said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
