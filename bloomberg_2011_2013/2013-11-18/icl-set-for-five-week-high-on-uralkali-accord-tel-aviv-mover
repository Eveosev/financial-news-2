Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  headed for the
highest close in a month on bets global potash prices will
stabilize following a change of ownership at  OAO Uralkali. (URKA)   The shares of the Dead Sea minerals harvester advanced 2.3
percent to 30.8 shekels, poised for the highest close since Oct.
15 at 2:35 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The benchmark TA-25 Index gained
0.8 percent.  Billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Group agreed to buy
Suleiman Kerimov’s stake in Uralkali, bolstering prospects that
a standoff over a global marketing venture for key crop nutrient
potash will be resolved. The sale may defuse a dispute between
Russia and Belarus sparked by Uralkali’s July 30 withdrawal from
a partnership that marketed 40 percent of global potash exports.
Shares of the Israeli potash producer have dropped 14 percent
since then.  “This is a first step toward reconciliation of the cartel
which is a positive for potash producers,” Guil Bashan, an
analyst at IBI-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv
said by phone. “It may lead to a stabilization of
potash prices.”  Israel Chemicals shares have been the  second-worst 
performers on the benchmark gauge after Potash Corporation of
Saskatchewan Inc. scrapped a proposed takeover in April and the
Uralkali dispute raised price war concerns, roiling the $20
billion market for the soil nutrient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
