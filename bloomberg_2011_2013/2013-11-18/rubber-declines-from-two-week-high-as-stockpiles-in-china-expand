Rubber fell from a two-week high
after data showed stockpiles in  China  swelled to a nine-year
high, boosting concern that demand from the largest user is
waning.  The contract for delivery in April on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.1 percent to 259.3 yen a kilogram
($2,586 a metric ton) and traded at 261.5 yen at 11:05 a.m.
local time. Futures on Nov. 15 settled at 262.1 yen, the highest
close since Oct. 30.  Stockpiles monitored by the Shanghai Futures Exchange
expanded 6.1 percent to 163,604 tons last week, the highest
level since November 2004. China represented 35 percent of
global demand last year, according to the International Rubber
Study Group.  “Concerns about demand weighed on the market,” said
Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk
Advisory in Tokyo.  Rubber for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell 0.2 percent to 19,120  yuan  ($3,140) a ton. Thai rubber
free-on-board added 0.3 percent to 78.85 baht ($2.50) a kilogram
on Nov. 15, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
 Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
