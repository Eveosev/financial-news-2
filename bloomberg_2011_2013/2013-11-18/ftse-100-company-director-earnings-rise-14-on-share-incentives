The directors of companies in the
U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  saw their total earnings rise 14 percent
in 2012-13, driven by a 58 percent increase in share-based long-term incentive payments, a study by Incomes Data Services found.  The median total earnings of a director of a company in the
benchmark index were 2.1 million pounds ($3.4 million), up from
1.9 million pounds the year before. The median salary was
568,500 pounds and the median long-term incentive payment was
1.2 million pounds.  “This boost to overall earnings took place without any of
last year’s talk of a shareholders’ spring, with fewer
institutional investors voting down remuneration reports,”
Steve Tatton, editor of IDS’s directors’ pay report, said in an
e-mailed statement. “This was perhaps because the vesting of
large share awards is currently less visible to investors than
salary increases and bonus payouts.”  London-based Incomes Data Services is a division of  Thomson
