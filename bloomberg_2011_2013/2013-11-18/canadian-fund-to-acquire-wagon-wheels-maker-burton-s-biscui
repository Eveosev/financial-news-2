Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan 
agreed to buy U.K. cookie maker Burton’s Biscuit Co., gaining
brands including Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels.  The purchase price is about 350 million pounds ($564
million), according to two people familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be named because the amount is confidential.  The acquisition from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and
funds managed by affiliates of Apollo Global Management LLC
resulted from a competitive bidding process, the pension-fund
manager said today in a  statement.   Burton’s management will maintain “a significant minority
stake” in the St Albans, England-based company, which employs
more than 2,000 people and has annual sales exceeding 340
million pounds. The food maker’s brands also include Maryland
Cookies and Lyons.  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  is the largest single-profession pension plan in  Canada  with net assets of C$129.5
billion ($124.3 billion) as of the end of 2012. The fund agreed
to acquire U.K. childcare provider Busy Bees Nursery Group last
month and has European investments that also include Camelot
Group Plc, operator of the U.K. National Lottery.  A spokeswoman for Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan didn’t
immediately return a call and e-mail outside of normal business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
