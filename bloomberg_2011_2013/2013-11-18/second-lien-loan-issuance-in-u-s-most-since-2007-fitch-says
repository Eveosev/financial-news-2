Issuance of loans that offer lenders
a lesser claim on a borrower’s assets is poised to be the most
in six years as fixed-income investors accept greater risks,
according to a report by  Fitch Ratings .  Second-lien loan sales have reached $28.8 billion this
year, the most since $40.5 billion of the debt was originated in
2007, according to a report from the ratings firm. About 46
percent of these loans are covenant-light, meaning they lack
lender protections like financial maintenance requirements.  Second-lien issuance is soaring as investors repressed by
the  Federal Reserve ’s zero interest rate policy are lulled by
below-average default rates and seek to boost returns. Loans
have  gained  4.46 percent this year, compared with a 6.15 percent
return for  high-yield bonds , according to the Standard &
Poor’s/LSTA Leveraged Loan Total Returns Index and Bloomberg
index data.  There have been about $60 billion of inflows into funds
that buy floating-rate debt this year through October, according
to Bank of America Corp.  The U.S. high-yield trailing 12-month default rate was 1.7
percent as of Sept. 30, according to Fitch. The measure peaked
at 17.6 percent in November 2002.  Second-lien loan buyers include collateralized loan
obligations,  hedge funds , prime funds, high-yield and other non-bank institutional investors, as well as distressed investors at
the lowest rating tier of issuance, according to Fitch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
