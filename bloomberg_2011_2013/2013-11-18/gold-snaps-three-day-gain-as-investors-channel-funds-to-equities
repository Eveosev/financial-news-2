Gold futures fell the most in a week
as a global equity rally cut demand for precious metals as
alternative investments. Silver slumped to a three-month low,
and palladium capped the biggest drop in six weeks.  The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities rose to the
highest since January 2008. Investors awaited details of the
last Federal Open Market Committee meeting to be published on
Nov. 20.  Janet Yellen , the nominee to replace  Ben S. Bernanke  as
Federal Reserve chairman, signaled on Nov. 14 that she would
continue record stimulus until the  U.S. economy  is stronger.  “Money is running toward equities,”  Michael Smith , the
president of T&K Futures & Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida,
said in a telephone interview. “Also, people want more
information about what the other Fed officials are thinking
about tapering.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,272.30 an ounce at 1:56 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest drop for a most-active contract since Nov. 8.
The metal has slumped 24 percent this year.  Gold is poised for the first annual decline since 2000.
Some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value amid
the equity rally and low U.S. inflation. Economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  on Nov. 8 forecast that the Fed probably will
delay reductions in bond purchases until March.  The net-long position in gold slumped 37 percent to 55,456
futures and options on the Comex in the week ended Nov. 12, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show, the biggest drop
since February. Short bets climbed to 54,143, the highest since
mid-August.  Price Drop  Silver futures for December delivery declined 1.8 percent
to $20.357 an ounce. Earlier, the price touched $20.29, the
lowest since Aug. 9.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
December delivery retreated 2.2 percent to $716.75 an ounce, the
biggest decline since Oct. 3.  Platinum futures for January delivery dropped 1.9 percent
to $1,411 an ounce. Earlier, the price touched $1,410.60, the
lowest since Oct. 17.  Northam Platinum Ltd. said talks with the  National Union of
Mineworkers , which called a strike two weeks ago in  South Africa 
over wages, were inconclusive on Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
