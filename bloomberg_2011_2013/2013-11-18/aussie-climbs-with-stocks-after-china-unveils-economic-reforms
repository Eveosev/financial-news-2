Australa’s dollar rose versus most
of its major peers after Chinese leaders unveiled the biggest
economic reforms since the 1990s, buoying the outlook for the
South Pacific nation’s exports to the world’s No. 2 economy.  Demand for the Aussie and kiwi was boosted as Chinese
stocks advanced toward a one-month high. Futures traders cut
their bearish bets on the Aussie last week by the most in almost
six months.  New Zealand ’s dollar held gains that took it to the
brink of a five-year high against its Australian counterpart
after a private report showed the smaller nation’s services
industry expanded at a faster pace last month.  “I’m relatively bullish on the Australian dollar,” said
Hideki Shibata, a senior interest-rate and currencies strategist
at Tokai Tokyo Research Center Co. “It’s a positive for the
Aussie that concern about  China  is easing.”  The Aussie jumped 0.4 percent to 94.03 U.S. cents as of
5:45 p.m. in Sydney, while New Zealand’s dollar appreciated 0.3
percent to 83.61 U.S. cents. The kiwi was at NZ$1.1248 per
Aussie after climbing for five-straight days to NZ$1.1236 at the
end of last week. It reached NZ$1.12 on Aug. 1, the strongest
since October 2008.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of shares advanced 2.1
percent, set for the highest close since October. China pledged
to allow more private investment in state-controlled industries
while couples can have two children if either parent is an only
child, according to a Communist Party decision published by the
official Xinhua News Agency on Nov. 15.  Net Shorts  Wagers on a decline in  Australia ’s currency against the
 U.S. dollar  outnumbered those on a gain by 35,809 on Nov. 12,
according to figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  Net shorts  rose 43 percent from a week ago,
the biggest increase since May 21.  Australia’s 10-year government note yields were little
changed at 4.21 percent. They rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, last week.  There’s a 23 percent likelihood that the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will lower the benchmark rate from 2.5 percent by
April, according to data on overnight-index swaps compiled by
Bloomberg. Traders see an 84 percent chance that the RBNZ will
raise the official cash rate by that month from a record low of
2.5 percent.  The  Performance of Services Index  increased to 58.2 in
October, a report from Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business NZ
showed today. The gauge hasn’t been above that level since
November 2007. The reading was 56.4 in September.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate was 64 basis points higher
than its equivalent in Australia. The two inverted this year and
the gap widened to 84 points in August, the most since December
2008. One basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  “The  Reserve Bank of New Zealand  will start hiking
 interest rates  in April next year,” said  Imre Speizer , a market
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Auckland. “I expect it
to see NZ$1.10 by the first quarter,” he said of the Aussie-kiwi rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
