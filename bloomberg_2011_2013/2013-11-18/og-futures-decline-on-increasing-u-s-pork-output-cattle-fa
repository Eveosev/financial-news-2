Hog futures fell for the fourth time
in five sessions as U.S. pork processors increased output and
animal weights climbed to the highest ever. Cattle prices
declined.  Meatpackers last week slaughtered an estimated 2.5 percent
more hogs than a week earlier, and in the week ended Nov. 9,
average carcass weights in the  Iowa  and southern Minnesota
region rose 1.1 percent to a record 280.8 pounds (127
kilograms), according to the Department of Agriculture. Hogs for
immediate delivery climbed 7 percent in the past 12 months,
while corn used in livestock feed tumbled 41 percent.  “Producers have had considerable incentive to hold onto
their hogs as long as possible because of cash prices” and
cheaper grain,  Dan Vaught , an economist at Doane Advisory
Services in  St. Louis , said a telephone interview. “Domestic
demand is holding up, but not doing particularly well.”  Hog futures for February settlement fell 0.2 percent to
90.1 cents a pound at 10:49 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
exchange. Last week, the contract dropped 2 percent.  Cattle futures for February delivery declined 0.3 percent
to $1.34375 a pound. On Nov. 14, the most-active contract
reached $1.34975, a 10-month high.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement fell less than
0.1 percent to $1.658.  To contact the reporter on this story:
