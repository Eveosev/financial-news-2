Yang Cuiyan, a 41-year-old
housekeeper from Anhui province, is one reason  China  is poised
to topple  India  as the world’s top consumer of gold even as
investors desert the metal.  Standing outside Beijing’s busiest jewelry store, wearing a
thick coat against the autumn chill, she clasps a gold necklace
that cost her 10,000  yuan  ($1,640), or five months’ wages.  “I don’t know anything about the stock market and I don’t
have enough money to buy property, so I figured gold is the
safest choice,” she said. “I can put it on when I go back home
to show everyone that I’m doing well.”  Yang, who made the 650-mile (1,000-kilometer) journey to
the capital from her rural home to visit relatives and shop, is
one of the legions of middle-aged Chinese women, respectfully
referred to as aunties, who bought coins and jewelry this year,
bringing support to a market shunned by many professional
investors who began doubting the metal as a store of value.  Bullion consumption in the world’s second-largest economy
will surge 29 percent to a record 1,000 metric tons in 2013,
according to the median of 13 estimates from analysts, traders
and gold producers in China surveyed by  Bloomberg News . Demand
that may ease 2.4 percent in 2014 from this peak still points to
purchases greater than any other nation and more than the U.S.,
 Europe  and the  Middle East  combined.  China’s demand for jewelry, bars and coins rose 30 percent
to 996.3 tons in the 12 months to September, while usage in
India gained 24 percent to 977.6 tons, according to the London-based World Gold Council. India was No. 1 for calendar 2012.  ‘Slam Dunk’  Images  in Chinese media of aunties clearing shelves in gold
shops after a 14 percent plunge in prices in two days in April
illustrate an appetite for bullion that defies the views of the
biggest banks in the West and points to limited investment
choices in China.  Warren Buffett , the world’s most successful
investor, said the metal has no appeal, and  Jeffrey Currie , the
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. commodities research chief who
correctly forecast the rout this year, on Oct. 8 called it a
“slam dunk” sell for 2014.  “In China, you look around and see very few places to put
your money,” said Duan Shihua, a partner at  Shanghai  Leading
Investment Management Co. “With the share market down and the
government nudging people away from real estate, gold will
remain a favored choice.”  Price Forecasts  Bullion is 34 percent below the record set in 2011 and on
course for its first annual loss since 2000 after falling 24
percent to $1,276.64 an ounce in  London  this year. The Standard
& Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities fell 5 percent since the
end of December, and the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index lost
2.1 percent. While the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
surged 18 percent over the same period, the Shanghai Composite
Index slumped 3.4 percent.  Bullion will average $1,175 in the third quarter of next
year, according to the median of estimates from the 10 most-accurate precious metals analysts tracked by Bloomberg in a
survey published last month. Prices were last at that level in
2010. Goldman expects prices at $1,050 by the end of 2014.  China’s rural per capita cash income in the first nine
months jumped by 12.5 percent from a year earlier, while urban
per capita disposable income rose 9.5 percent, data from the
National Bureau of Statistics shows. The economy will grow 7.6
percent this year and 7.4 percent in 2014, according to the
median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The nation ranks fourth worldwide for people with $1
million or more in investable assets, after the number of high-net-worth individuals in the country rose 14 percent to 643,000
last year, according to a report by Cap Gemini SA and Royal Bank
of  Canada . The U.S. ranks first, followed by Japan and  Germany .  Bearish Signs  Policy makers clamped down on property investments in March
to cool the housing market, ordering the central bank to raise
down-payment requirements for second mortgages in cities with
excessive cost gains. New home prices in China’s four major
cities in October jumped the most since January 2011, the
National Bureau of Statistics said yesterday.  Societe Generale SA, which correctly predicted gold’s slump
this year, sees prices averaging $1,125 next year, the lowest
since 2009, because an eventual slowing of U.S. stimulus as the
economy strengthens will cut demand. Credit Suisse Group AG
forecasts an average of $1,180 for next year and $1,200 for
2015. Bank of America Corp. is more bullish, predicting $1,294
in 2014 and $1,356 the year after. Barclays Plc predicts China’s
demand growth will slow to 5 percent next year from 15 percent
this year.  Fed Easing  “The  Federal Reserve  will eventually reduce quantitative
easing and that will drive up bond yields there,” said Wang Weimin, a gold analyst at Dalian Fortune Futures Co. in Dalian,
northeast China. “Funding costs have been rising inside China,
all bearish for investment in gold.”  The  premium  to take immediate delivery of gold in China has
declined to $1.30 an ounce from an average of $19.70 this year
and a record $109.29 in April, according to data from the
Shanghai Gold Exchange. Any annual decline in Chinese
consumption would be the first since 2002, when the government
lifted a ban on bullion trading and opened the Shanghai bullion
bourse.  While China overtook  South Africa  to be the world’s largest
gold producer in 2007, domestic output failed to keep up with
the nation’s consumption, said Shanghai Leading Investment
Management’s Duan. Production of 403 tons in 2012 compares with
domestic demand of 776 tons, according to the China Gold
Association.  Imports Surge  Net gold imports to China via  Hong Kong  more than doubled
to 826 tons in the first nine months of the year, according to
data from the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department. Global
gold ETP  holdings  tumbled 29 percent this year, reaching the
lowest since 2010 last week, while more than $64 billion was
wiped from the assets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China may allow more companies to import and export gold
next year as it seeks to open its financial markets, according
to draft rules released by the central bank on Sept. 30. It’s
considering allowing foreign financial institutions and
companies that produce more than 10 tons of gold a year to
import and export.  “We can’t sell gold now in China produced in our overseas
mines,” said Lan Fusheng, vice chairman at  Zijin Mining Group
Co. (2899) , China’s largest gold miner by market value. “We would
definitely welcome this change.”  The company has projects in Tajikistan and  Australia  and
produces 6 tons to 7 tons outside of China annually, Lan said.  Government Reserves  The People’s Bank of China, which imports gold for foreign-exchange reserves, hasn’t given an update on its holdings since
April 2009, when they stood at 1,054 tons. China’s government
may have accumulated about 300 tons of gold to diversify the
state reserves during the first six months of the year, said
Philip Klapwijk, the founder of Precious Metals Insights Ltd.,
who spent 25 years monitoring the market.  Central banks added almost 535 tons to reserves last year,
the most since 1964, and may buy a further 350 tons this year,
the WGC estimates.  Russia raised bullion reserves about 57.4 tons this year,
while Kazakhstan added 20.3 tons and  South Korea ’s climbed by 20
tons, according to Bloomberg calculations based on International
Monetary Fund data.  In Shanghai, China’s center for gold trading, Malca-Amit
Global Ltd. said it opened a vault this month big enough to
store 2,000 tons of the metal, as well as diamonds and jewelry.
The company’s Hong Kong facility, which can hold 1,000 tons,
opened in September.  “I don’t want to put my money in a bank,” said Yang, the
auntie from Anhui. “I want to keep up with my relatives and
friends back home. We all like to compete to see whose necklace
is thicker.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
