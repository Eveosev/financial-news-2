Shortstop Brendan Ryan agreed on a
contract with the  New York Yankees , who are in need of help at
the position with  Derek Jeter  trying to come back from a
lingering ankle injury, according to CBSSports.com.  The Yankees also are pursuing free-agent shortstop Stephen Drew, who played for the Boston Red Sox last season, the  website
said  without citing a source for its information.  Ryan joined the Yankees in a trade from the  Seattle
Mariners  in September. He batted .197 last season, including
.220 in 17 games for New York.  The 31-year-old Ryan has a .237 career batting average and
twice has led his league in defensive wins above replacement,
which measures playersâ€™ skills against the average Major League
Baseball player.  Jeter, 39, was limited to 17 games last season after
breaking his ankle in October 2012. He signed a one-year, $12
million contract this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
