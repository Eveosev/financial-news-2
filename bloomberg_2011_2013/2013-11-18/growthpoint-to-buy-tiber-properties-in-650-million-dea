  Growthpoint Properties Ltd. (GRT) ,  South
Africa ’s biggest property company, is to acquire Tiber Group’s
entire real estate portfolio for 6.6 billion rand ($650 million)
to expand its commercial property presence.  The proposal gives Growthpoint more than 308,100 square
meters (3.3 million square feet) of office and commercial real
estate mostly in Johannesburg’s northern suburbs as well as
Tiber’s management business, the Johannesburg-based company said
in a statement today.  “The property transaction presents an opportunity to
acquire arguably one of the finest office property portfolios in
South Africa in terms of location and scale supported by long-weighted average lease expiries and a quality underlying tenant
base,” the company said.  The income-producing properties will have a yield of 7.41
percent after real-estate asset-management fees, the company
said. Growthpoint will also acquire 48,000 square meters of
undeveloped land and a 50 percent interest in a 19,200 square
meter development project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
