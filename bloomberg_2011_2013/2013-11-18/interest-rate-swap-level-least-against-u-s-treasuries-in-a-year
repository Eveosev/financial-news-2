Treasuries rose, pushing the yield
on the 10-year note to the lowest in more than a week, on
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will press on with bond-buying
into next year.  The  yield curve  measuring the difference between five- and
10-year note yields reached the steepest since August 2011 last
week, when Fed Chairman-nominee  Janet Yellen  said that she’s
committed to promoting a strong economic recovery and will
ensure stimulus isn’t removed too soon. The Fed carried out two
purchases of Treasuries today under its quantitative-easing
program, with trading abridged next week because of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday.  “She’s not willing to give up the operation at this
point,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury
trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “They are very
sensitive to the fact that they need to make sure any forward
guidance structure gives them confidence that rates won’t back
up significantly while they come in to taper.”  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  fell four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.67 percent at 4:59 p.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the
2.75 percent note due November 2023 rose 10/32, or $3.13 per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 23/32.  The yield on the five-year note dropped three basis points
to 1.31 percent. It touched a 2013 high of 1.86 percent on Sept.
6 and a low of 0.63 percent on May 1.  Price Swings  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
MOVE Index was at 58.31, the lowest level since May. It touched
a record low of 48.87 on May 9 and a 2013 high of 117.89 on July
5.  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $232 billion,
below the 2013 average of $314 billion. It fell to a 2013 low of
$147.8 billion on Aug. 9. The high was $662.3 billion on May 22.  The five- to 10-year note yield curve was at 1.35
percentage points, after reaching 1.37 percentage points on Nov.
14 as investors bet Yellen will keep short-term rates low.  “People are rushing into the five-year,” said Jason Rogan, managing director of U.S. government trading at
Guggenheim Securities LLC, a New York-based brokerage for
institutional investors. “That’s viewed as the safe place in
the front end to park your money and still get something out of
it yield-wise.”  Overseas Demand  International investors were net buyers of U.S. long-term
portfolio assets in September as demand strengthened from  China 
and  Japan , the two largest foreign holders of Treasuries.  The net long-term portfolio investment inflow was $25.5
billion after a revised $9.8 billion outflow in August, the
Treasury Department said in a statement in  Washington .  Foreign holdings of Treasuries rose $57.1 billion or 1
percent in September to $5.65 trillion, the biggest jump since
February, U.S. government data show. U.S. government securities
held by overseas investors have increased 1.4 percent this year,
on track for the slowest rise since the Treasury began releasing
full-year data in 2001.  Holdings in China, the largest foreign creditor to the
U.S., climbed by $25.7 billion, or 2 percent, in September to
$1.294 trillion, the biggest gain since February. Japanese
holdings of Treasuries rose for a third month by $29 billion or
2.5 percent to $1.178 trillion, the most on record.  Yellen Stance  Yellen, speaking last week during her confirmation hearing,
indicated she’ll press on with the central bank’s unprecedented
monetary stimulus until she sees a robust recovery, downplaying
risks the policy is leading to asset bubbles.  “Although there is limited evidence of reach for yield, we
don’t see a broad buildup in leverage,” she said.  Traders project an 88 percent chance the Fed will keep its
benchmark rate at current levels by December 2014, compared with
a 77 percent odds a month earlier, according to fed funds
futures data compiled by Bloomberg.  “While growth in 2013 has been disappointing, I believe a
good case can be made that the pace of growth will pick up some
in 2014 and then somewhat more in 2015,”  Fed Bank of New York
President William C. Dudley said in the text of remarks given in
Flushing, New York. “As growth picks up, I expect to see more
substantial improvement in labor market conditions.”  U.S.  interest-rate swaps  fell to the least in more than
three years relative to Treasuries as traders sought higher-yielding assets outside of government debt on bets Yellen will
keep borrowing costs down.  Swaps Market  The difference between the five-year Treasury rate and
similar-maturity swap narrowed to 9.75 basis points, the least
since March 2010, based on closing levels. The spread shrinks as
investors seek to receive a fixed-interest rate on contracts
backed by a bank over the relative safety of Treasuries.  The U.S. central bank buys $85 billion of Treasuries and
 mortgage-backed securities  each month to put downward pressure
on borrowing costs. Officials will decide to pare the purchases
to $70 billion a month at their March 18-19 meeting, according
to the median of 32 economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey on
Nov. 8.  The Fed purchased $1.47 billion in Treasuries maturing
between February 2038 and August 2043 today. It also bought
$3.72 billion in Treasuries maturing between August 2019 and
November 2020 in its second operation.  The central bank needs to set a fixed-size for the current
purchase program and “bring it to an end” after reaching that
amount, Fed Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said
in the text of a speech in that city. There’s little evidence
more asset-buying will improve the U.S. recovery, he said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of shares rallied to a
record today. High-yield debt around the world has returned 5.7
percent this year, versus a 2.3 percent loss for Treasuries,
based on the Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.  The Treasury is scheduled to sell $13 billion in 10-year
inflation-indexed debt on Nov. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
