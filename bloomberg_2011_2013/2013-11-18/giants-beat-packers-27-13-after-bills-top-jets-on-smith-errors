The  New York Giants  beat the Green
Bay Packers 27-13 for their fourth straight win in the National
Football League.  The Giants, who began the season with six defeats, are 4-6
after the win at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
The Packers, playing without injured quarterback  Aaron Rodgers ,
drop to 5-5 with their third consecutive loss.  Earlier today the Jets lost 37-14 to the Buffalo Bills, who
scored 17 points on turnovers by  New York  quarterback Geno
Smith. Buffalo got a second-quarter touchdown two plays after a
fumble by the rookie following a sack. Da’Norris Searcy then
returned one of Smith’s three interceptions for a touchdown,
while another pick led to a field goal.  Smith was replaced in the fourth quarter by Matt Simms,
whose first drive culminated in a touchdown for the Jets.  The result leaves the Jets at 5-5, while the Bills ended a
three-game losing streak to improve to 4-7.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
