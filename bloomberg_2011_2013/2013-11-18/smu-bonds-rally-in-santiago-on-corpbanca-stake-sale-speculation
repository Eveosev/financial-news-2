SMU SA bonds rallied on speculation
billionaire owner Alvaro Saieh will sell his controlling stake
in Corpbanca SA and use the proceeds to rescue the Chilean
grocery chain.  The price on the securities maturing in 2020 rose 5.66
cents to 61.94 cents on the dollar at 12:56 p.m. in New York.
The yield fell 227 basis points, or 2.27 percentage points, to
18.22 percent, the biggest drop since the debt was issued in
February. The bonds are the most-traded dollar securities today
in  emerging markets , according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Speculation that Saieh will sell control of Corpbanca to
meet a pledge to invest $300 million in SMU by year-end mounted
after Itau Unibanco Holding SA told analysts on a conference
call last week that  Chile  is a priority. SMU is in violation of
its debt agreements after restating first-quarter earnings.  “It is just natural that the price reflect the benefit
that the owner is selling the bank,” Klaus Spielkamp, a fixed-income trader at Bulltick Securities LLC in Miami, said by e-mail. “It is understood that he will be more able to capitalize
SMU.”  Press representatives for SMU, Corpbanca and Saieh didn’t
immediately respond to requests for comment.  Shares (CORPBANC)  of Santiago-based Corpbanca, Chile’s fourth-largest
non-state-owned bank, jumped 2.8 percent to 6.50 pesos and are
up 12 percent over three days, the most since 2011. The
benchmark Chilean IPSA index gained 0.8 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
