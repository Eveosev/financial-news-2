A South African winemaker, Dave
Hidden, has produced the first ocean-matured wine from the
country, the Sunday Times reported, citing Hidden.  The wine, Shipwreck Shiraz 2009, was matured in a barrel
encased in a 2.5 metric ton concrete and stainless-steel case
12.5 meters (41 feet) underwater about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles)
off the Struisbaai harbor near Cape Agulhas in  South Africa â€™s
Western Cape, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. It was
placed on a reef where great white sharks breed to discourage
its theft.  Holes were drilled in the case to allow the sea to interact
with the barrel, Hidden said, according to the Sunday Times. The
290 bottles of wine are being sold at 900 rand ($89) each.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
