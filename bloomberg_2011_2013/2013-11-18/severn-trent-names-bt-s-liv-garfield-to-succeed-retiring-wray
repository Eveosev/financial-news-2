Severn Trent Plc (SVT) , the U.K.’s second-largest publicly traded water company, today named Liv Garfield
of  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  as its new chief executive officer to replace
Tony Wray next spring on his retirement.  Garfield headed BT’s Openreach unit that rolled out a 2.5
billion-pound ($4 billion) fiber broadband network. She becomes
one of four female FTSE 100 Index CEOs with Alison Cooper of
Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Carolyn McCall at EasyJet Plc and
Angela Ahrendts at the U.K.’s largest luxury company Burberry
Group Plc, who is leaving in mid-year to join Apple Inc.  Garfield, 38, will be joining a Coventry-based company
named for two of Britain’s biggest rivers that last June
rejected as too low a 5.3 billion-pound takeover offer led by
Canada’s Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc.  “It is a huge wrench to leave Openreach but I feel the
time is now right to take on a fresh challenge,” Garfield said
in a statement. “BT has been a terrific employer, giving me
lots of room to grow and develop my business skills.”  Since Garfield became Openreach boss in 2011, the
availability of fiber over the network of the biggest U.K. phone
company has risen more than fourfold to 17 million households.  To contact the reporter on this story:
