Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S.
meat processor, posted higher-than-expected quarterly revenue
after a gain in prices and sales volumes for beef and chicken.  Fiscal fourth-quarter sales rose 7 percent to $8.89
billion, Tyson said today in a statement, beating the $8.87
billion average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income climbed to $261 million, or 70 cents a share, in
the three months through Sept. 28, from $185 million, or 51
cents, a year earlier. That matched the 70-cent-a-share average
estimate.  For the 2014 fiscal year, Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson
said domestic protein output will rise by about 1 percent and
sales will be about $36 billion, compared with the $35.6 billion
average of 12 analysts’ estimates. Profitability at Tyson’s beef
unit, its largest by revenue, may be less that the
“normalized” range of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent, it said.  Tyson increased 2.3 percent to $29.42 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
