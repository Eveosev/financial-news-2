Nampak Ltd. (NPK) , a South African
packaging company, said it will buy closely-held Nigerian
drinks-can maker Alucan and has an option to purchase a plastics
manufacturer in a $301 million deal to expand in Africa’s most
populous country.  “This acquisition will significantly increase Nampak’s
presence in  Nigeria , which is Africa’s second largest economy
and where we already manufacture food and general cans in our
factory in Lagos,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Marshall said
in a statement today.  Nampak also said it was considering an expansion of its
Angola beverage can factory with a second line. Investment in
the entire plant, including the existing facility, will probably
be about $250 million, the company’s regional head Tim Leaf-Wright told reporters on Nov. 14.  Nampak wants to expand in faster-growing African economies
to help offset slower economic expansion in its home South
African market, the Johannesburg-based company said last
November. Its  shares  increased 2.6 percent to 31.56 rand as of
9:50 a.m. in Johannesburg, paring a 2013 decline to 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
