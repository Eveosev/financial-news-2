Light  Louisiana  Sweet gained the
most in six months relative to the U.S. benchmark as refineries
on the  Gulf Coast  returned from seasonal maintenance, increasing
demand for crude oil.  LLS, the Gulf’s light, sweet benchmark, strengthened by $1
to a premium of $2.70 a barrel more than West Texas Intermediate
at 4:02 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
the largest increase since May 15.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  completed maintenance at its 239,000-barrel-a-day Lake Charles refinery in Louisiana, Dennis Nuss, a Houston-based spokesman for the company, said by e-mail.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s
330,000-barrel-a-day plant in Pascagoula,  Mississippi , is
operating at normal capacity after a fire in a furnace Nov. 15,
according to  Kurt Glaubitz , a  San Ramon , California-based
company spokesman.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet oil strengthened by $1.30 to a
premium of $2.90 a barrel more than WTI. Thunder Horse crude
gained $1 to a 50-cent premium.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude, strengthened by 30 cents
to a discount of $2.70 a barrel relative to WTI. Southern Green
Canyon rose by $1.40 to a $4.60 discount. Poseidon weakened by
15 cents to a discount of $4.15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
