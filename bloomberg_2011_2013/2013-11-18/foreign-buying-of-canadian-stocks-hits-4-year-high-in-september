Purchases of  Canadian equities  
by foreigners reached the highest in four years in September as
investors sought to take advantage of a stock rally, a
government report showed.  Non-resident investors acquired C$10.79 billion ($10.36
billion) of Canadian stocks after selling C$2.19 billion of
equities a month earlier, Statistics Canada said today in
Ottawa. Total foreign investment in Canadian securities rose to
C$8.36 billion in September, the highest in five months, as the
stock purchases offset divestures of bonds.  Foreign investors offloaded C$2.78 billion of Canadian
bonds, led by a C$3.73 billion drop in holdings of federal
government bonds. The decline was led by retirements, the
statistics agency said.  Non-residents also bought C$362 million worth of money
market instruments during the month.  Total purchases of Canadian securities through September
this year have slowed to C$32.36 billion, less than half of the
C$67.01 billion total for the same period in 2012, amid the
diminished appeal of  Canada â€™s stable, AAA credit rating, the
only one among the Group of Seven nations.  Canadians divested C$1.46 billion worth of foreign
securities in September, with declines in both bonds and stocks.
Purchases of securities abroad this year have totaled C$15.74
billion, down from C$18.17 billion, Statistics Canada said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
