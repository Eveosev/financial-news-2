Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the oil and gas
engineer that’s lost a quarter of its value this year, dropped
the most since it listed in 2005 in  London  trading after
predicting “flat to modest” profit growth.  Petrofac fell 17 percent, the biggest slump since October
2005, to 1,200 pence. Trading volumes were six times higher than
the three-month daily average.  “We expect group net income in 2014 to show flat to modest
growth year-on-year,” Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari said
today in a statement. Meeting 2015 earnings targets will also be
dependent on the timing of potential contract awards next year.  Petrofac is seeking to reach $862 million in post-tax
income by 2015, more than doubling 2010 recurring profit. While
project delays in Abu Dhabi and  Malaysia  have slowed earnings
growth, the company can still meet its goal in two years, it
said. That may require a profit jump of about 30 percent from
2014 to 2015, Chief Financial Officer Tim Weller said today.  Petrofac’s outlook “implies a cut to forecasts of about 15
percent in 2014 and 10 percent in 2015,” said Neill Morton, an
analyst at Investec Securities Ltd. in London. “Petrofac now
indicates that it will require further new contract awards in
order to meet its existing 2015 profit target.”  Worst Performer  Petrofac was the worst performer on the  FTSE 100 (UKX)  index
today. The London-based company has lost more than 1 billion
pounds ($1.6 billion) in market capitalization this year after
increasing its value eightfold in the seven years since its 2005
listing.  The Upper Zakum field project in  Abu Dhabi  has been delayed
after studies were conducted to increase its capacity. That will
defer income to 2015 from 2014, Petrofac said. In Malaysia, it’s
undertaking engineering studies at the Berantai development that
also point to a deferral of revenue from 2014 into later years.  Petrofac’s order backlog totaled $14.3 billion as of Oct.
31, the same as at the end of June.  “The large and complex nature of our projects can lead to
issues outside of our control,” CFO Weller said on a conference
call. “Despite the rephasing of some contracts, we remain
confident about the long-term strength of Petrofac.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
