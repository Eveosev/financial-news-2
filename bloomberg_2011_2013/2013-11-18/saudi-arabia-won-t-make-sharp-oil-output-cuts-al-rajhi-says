Saudi Arabia is not expected to make
“sharp” cuts to its crude production in November and December,
Al Rajhi Capital said.  “Any meaningful decline in the kingdom’s oil production
will take place only when the majority of Libyan oil production
comes back and Iranian oil production starts rising,” the
investment arm of the nation’s biggest bank by market value said
in an e-mailed report today.  Saudi Arabia is burning more  fuel oil  at  power plants 
instead of crude this year, “which means that the seasonality
impact on crude production will be smaller in winter,” the
investment bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
