The U.K.’s high-achieving 16 to 18
year-olds are shunning careers in banking in favor of jobs in
technology, media and entrepreneurialism, according to a poll by
 Axa SA (CS)  and  YouGov , the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Banking and financial services ranked among the bottom five
of 15 career choices presented in the survey of 321 students
achieving at least three A or A* grades at GCSE level, according
to the newspaper, without saying when or how the poll was taken.
Retail, property, manufacturing and engineering were the other
low-ranked choices, the U.K. newspaper said.  A third of the students said the banking collapse had
turned them off pursuing a career in the industry and almost
four in 10 said they didn’t like the “ethics” of banking,
according to the Sunday Telegraph. More than half said the work
was boring and a third said the job wouldn’t allow a good work-
life balance, the Sunday Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
