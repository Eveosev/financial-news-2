Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on speculation that a U.S. Midwest crop tour will show hot
temperatures in July and dry weather in August eroded yield
prospects.  Twenty-one of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to  Chicago  on Aug. 19 forecast that corn will rise for a fourth
straight week, and 22 of 28 respondents said soybeans will gain.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 1.5 percent to $7.2525 a bushel, and
soybean futures for November delivery gained 2.5 percent to
$13.685 a bushel, the first rally in four weeks.  Last weekâ€™s gains in corn and soybeans were expected by the
majority of analysts and traders surveyed on Aug. 12.  Bullish on corn: 21    Bullish on soybeans: 22
Bearish on corn:  6    Bearish on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
