Japanese  stock futures  fell on
concern the yen’s advance to a post World War II record against
the dollar will damp the outlook for exporters’ earnings.
Australian stock futures were little changed.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
largest camera maker, slid 0.8 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the biggest global
automaker, declined 3.7 percent. ADRs of  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,
Australia’s No. 1 gold producer, increased 4.7 percent after the
price of the precious metal rose to a record.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,630 in Chicago on Aug. 19, down from 8,710
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,630 in
 Osaka , at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index rose less than 0.1 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
fell 0.3 percent today in Wellington.  “People are getting nervous about the yen’s strength after
it reached a new record high against the dollar,” said
 Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc.
“Export-related stocks such as auto and electronics will be
sold as negative factors accumulate.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.1
today. In New York, the index fell 1.5 percent on Aug. 19 as the
cheapest price-earnings ratios since 2009 failed to lure
investors amid concern the global economy is weakening.  Europe Debt  Concern about Europe’s sovereign debt issue also grew after
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she’ll resist pressure to
back common euro-area bonds as a means to solve the region’s
debt crisis. Investor calls for euro bonds intensified last week
as concern about the debt crisis and a weakening global economy
drove European stocks to their lowest level in more than two
years.  The yen touched a post World War II record high of 75.95
per dollar on Aug. 19 amid concern the U.S. economy is slowing
and Europe’s debt crisis is worsening. The yen fell to 76.76 per
dollar today from 76.55 after the Nikkei newspaper reported
 Japan ’s government and central bank are prepared to intervene in
the foreign-exchange market this week if the yen continues to
strengthen. A stronger yen reduces the outlook for Japanese
exporters when their overseas income is repatriated.  Central bankers from around the world will meet this week
in  Jackson Hole  at an annual conference sponsored by the Federal
Reserve Bank of Kansas City, the same place where Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke triggered financial rallies a year ago.  Gold Rises  Gold rose to a record above $1,880 an ounce in New York
last week, rallying for a seventh straight week, on concern the
global economy is slowing, boosting demand for the haven metal.
Gold for December delivery gained $30.20, or 1.7 percent, to
settle at $1,852.20 in New York after touching $1,881.40, the
highest ever.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 13 percent this year
through Aug. 19, compared with an 11 percent drop by the S&P 500
and a 19 percent decline by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12 times estimated earnings
on average, compared with 11.3 times for the S&P 500 and 9.2
times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
