French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
popularity resumed a decline this month, an Ifop survey for the
 Journal du Dimanche  showed.  The president’s approval rating slipped to  33 percent  from
36 percent in July after climbing by 6 percentage points the
previous month, the weekly newspaper reported today, citing an
opinion poll by the Paris-based institute. The number of people
saying they were dissatisfied with him also climbed by 3
percentage points, the poll showed. A number of surveys earlier
this year had showed Sarkozy’s popularity to be at record lows.  Ifop polled 938 people of 18 years or older by telephone on
Aug. 18 and Aug. 19, JDD said. No margin of error was given.  Prime Minister  Francois Fillon ’s support rating climbed by
1 percentage point to 51 percent this month, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
