Egypt ’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in more than a week as protesters demonstrated
outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo after a deadly incident at
the border and following a slump in global markets.  Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) , Egypt’s biggest publicly
traded builder, fell 3.3 percent. Al Arafa Investments &
Consulting, a clothing manufacturer that uses Israeli products,
lost the most since Aug. 9. The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 3.2
percent, the most since Aug. 9, to 4,593.39 at the 1:30 p.m.
close in Cairo.  “This drop is clearly due to the political tensions in
Sinai,” said Tamer Nigm, head of sales and trading at Cairo-
based Watheeqa Securities Brokearage. “There are fears that the
situation may escalate.”  Egypt demanded Israel apologize for the deaths of three
Egyptian policemen who were killed on Aug. 18 after militants
crossed the southern border and opened fire on cars and buses.
 Israel  is investigating the possibility its forces inadvertently
killed the Egyptians while shooting at the attackers, said a
military officer who declined to be identified, citing
regulations.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks tumbled 5.9
percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 6.3 percent Aug. 18
through 19. Reports showed jobless claims rose in the world’s
largest economy and Philadelphia-area manufacturing shrank by
the most since 2009, while investors speculated that European
banks lack sufficient capital.  Orascom Construction  slid to 244.17 pounds, the lowest
level since Aug. 9. Al Arafa, the nation’s biggest clothing
exporter, declined 3.7 percent to 52 cents. The company benefits
from manufacturing in so-called Qualified Industrial Zones,
allowing it duty-free access to the U.S. market provided its
products have Israeli input.  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , a Cairo-based luxury real-
estate developer, fell to the lowest level since May 16 after
reporting an 81.4 million-pound loss for the six-months ended
June 30 after a profit of 191.4 million a year-earlier. The
shares retreated 3.8 percent to 1.77 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
