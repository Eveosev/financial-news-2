Archer Capital , an Australian
private-equity firm formed in 1996, aims to raise A$1.25 billion
($1.3 billion) from investors for a fifth fund.  Archer is targeting Australian and international
institutional investors, and is “confident of achieving that
target in a short period of time,” the Sydney-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The company agreed to sell Australian business management
software maker MYOB Pty Ltd., which it bought in 2009, to
Boston-based Bain Capital LLC for an undisclosed sum, the
companies said today. Archer has also been involved in the
recent sale of Cellarmasters Wines to  Woolworths Ltd. (WOW)  and
acquisitions including the Red Rooster and Oporto fast-food
chains, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
