India  will clear its debt over oil
imports from Iran by the end of August, state-run  Mehr  news
agency reported, citing Mohsen Qamsari, National Iranian Oil
Co.’s director for international affairs.  Four Indian oil buyers are paying their debt and so far
more than $2 billion has been settled, Qamsari told Mehr
yesterday without providing details. Indian refiners’ debt to
Iran was $4.8 billion in early August, National Iranian Oil Co.
Managing Director Ahmad Qalebani said on Aug. 8.  The Persian Gulf state is constrained by international
sanctions over its nuclear program and Indian refiners have said
banks are unwilling to transfer payments for their oil
purchases. India has sorted out the financial impasse with  Iran ,
the country’s Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said in
parliament on Aug. 12, without providing details.  Iran is the second-largest oil producer in the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries after  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
