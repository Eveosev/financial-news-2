The  New Zealand  and Australian
dollars advanced against the yen on speculation the Federal
Reserve will consider additional steps to bolster the U.S.
economy, buoying the outlook for commodities.  The kiwi, as the New Zealand currency is nicknamed, snapped
a two-day slide against the dollar before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  speaks on Aug. 26 in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, where he
last year signaled a second round of debt purchases known as
quantitative easing.  “The second round of quantitative easing was part of the
reason behind a jump in commodity prices, so a third round would
cause a similar situation,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager of the
foreign bond department in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities Co., a
unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market value.  New Zealand’s currency appreciated 1.2 percent to 63.43 yen
at 12:59 p.m. in New York, from 62.68 on Aug. 19. The kiwi
advanced 1 percent to 82.62 U.S. cents, from 81.82. Australia’s
dollar gained 0.7 percent to 80.21 yen, from 79.66, and traded
at $1.0444, compared with $1.0406.  To contact the reporter on this story:
