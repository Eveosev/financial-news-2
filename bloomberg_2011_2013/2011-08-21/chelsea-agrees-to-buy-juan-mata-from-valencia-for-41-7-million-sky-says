Chelsea and Valencia said they
reached an agreement for the transfer of winger Juan Mata to the
London soccer club.  Neither team disclosed the fee in statements on their
websites last night. Chelsea will pay about 30 million euros
($43.1 million) for Mata, Spanish sports newspaper As reported.  “The move is now subject to the player passing a medical
and agreeing personal terms,” Chelsea said on its  website .  Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas has identified the need
to bolster his squad’s midfield depth before the transfer window
closes Aug. 31. The Blues have also been linked in the U.K.
media with a bid for Tottenham playmaker Luka Modric.  Mata, who had previously been a target of Arsenal and
Tottenham, according to U.K. newspapers, helped  Spain  win the
Under-21 European Championship in June and also was a member of
Spain’s 2010 World Cup-winning squad.  Mata scored 36 goals in four seasons since joining Valencia
from Real Madrid’s youth team in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
