Visits to U.K. stores fell in the
three months through July as soaring prices squeezed spending
power and concerns about  job security  grew, the  British Retail
Consortium  said.  The number of shoppers in malls, town centers and out-of-
town shopping parks declined 1 percent from a year earlier, the
London-based industry group said in a report published today.
Eleven percent of ground-floor stores in U.K. town centers and
malls were vacant in May, it said.  “All types of shopping locations saw reduced footfall
year-on-year,” BRC Director General  Stephen Robertson  said.
“Fewer people are shopping because households are facing high
inflation, low wage growth and uncertainty about future job
prospects.”  The BRC-ATCM-Springboard Retail Footfall Monitor was
published by the BRC, the Association of Town Centre Management
and Springboard for the first time today. The gauge measures
visits per week at more than 500 shopping locations in 152 towns
and cities across the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
