Autonomy Corp.’s Chief Executive
Officer Mike Lynch says U.S. and U.K. companies should operate
on a “level playing field” concerning takeovers, the Sunday
Telegraph reported.  British companies shouldn’t get special protection from
bids by foreign multinationals, and U.S. firms with so-called
poison pills to defend against buyouts shouldn’t be able to
easily bid for a U.K. company, the newspaper cited Lynch saying.  Lynch intends to grow Autonomy’s business in the U.K.,
particularly by providing products for  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
which is in the process of buying the U.K. software maker, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
