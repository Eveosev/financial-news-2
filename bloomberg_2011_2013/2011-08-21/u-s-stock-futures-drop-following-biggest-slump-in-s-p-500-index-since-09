U.S. stock futures rose, signaling
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will rebound from its biggest
four-week drop since 2009, amid speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will unveil further measures to support the economy.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the biggest U.S. aluminum producer, gained 2.1
percent in early  New York  trading, while  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) 
advanced as the precious metal increased for a sixth day.
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , the largest oilfield-services provider, rose
in Paris amid speculation the civil war in  Libya  may be drawing
to a close.  S&P 500 futures expiring in September gained 1.5 percent to
1,140 as of 7:42 a.m. in New York. The U.S. equity benchmark
plunged 4.7 percent to 1,123.53 last week, giving it a 16
percent loss since July 22. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
gained 135 points, or 1.3 percent, to 10,955 today.  “The market is expecting another round of asset purchases
and it will come,” said Matthias Jasper, head of equities at
WGZ Bank AG in Dusseldorf. “I would be on the cautious side but
it’s a pretty good level to make a small entry. There are some
bargain hunters out there.”  The Fed is holding its annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, this weekend. This time last year Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  hinted that the central bank might embark on a second
round of asset purchases, kicking off a 28 percent rally in the
S&P 500 that ended in a three-year high on April 29.  Treasury Yields  Record-low yields on Treasuries show traders expect
Bernanke to signal as that he will begin a third round of asset
purchases. Barclays Plc said 10-year yields indicate traders
have priced in $500 billion to $600 billion of Treasury
purchases by the Fed.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  said current rates can only
be justified by more bond buying, also known as quantitative
easing, or assuming the economy will shrink 2 percent.  U.S. stocks tumbled last week as concern the global economy
is stalling overshadowed the cheapest valuations in 2 1/2 years.
The Dow fell 451.37 points, or 4 percent, to 10,817.65,
extending its four-week decline to 1,863.51 points.  Technology, industrial and raw-material companies in the
S&P 500 dropped at least 6.9 percent last week, the most among
10 groups. Caterpillar Inc. and Alcoa retreated more than 8.4
percent after some of the world’s biggest banks -- Morgan
Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup -- cut economic
growth forecasts.  “People just want to stop the pain,”  Matt McCormick , a
money manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl & Gaynor Inc., which
oversees $4 billion, said in a telephone interview. “They are
looking for safety, stability and downside protection. Yes, the
market is getting cheaper and cheaper, but not many people
really care about valuations right now. Investors are concerned
about a recession. The macro level is more important.”  Debt Burden  The  S&P 500  has fallen 18 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 amid concern about  Europe ’s government debt
burden and a global economic slowdown. The decline through Aug.
8 drove the index to a valuation of 12.2 times reported
earnings, the lowest level since March 2009. Its price-earnings
ratio is now 12.3, compared with the average of 16.4 since 1954,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Profit at S&P 500 companies is forecast to rise 17 percent
to $99.05 a share in 2011 and 14 percent to $112.81 in 2012,
according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks in the S&P 500 are moving in lockstep with each
other by the most since at least 1990, a sign that the market’s
biggest retreat in three years may not be over, according to MF
Global Holdings Ltd. The average correlation coefficient between
the 500 companies and the index was 0.8268 on Aug. 18, using 60
days of data, according to MF Global.  ‘Liquidating Equities’  High correlation “is usually the case in a  bear market ,
when investors are liquidating equities as an asset class,”
Craig Peskin, co-head of technical analysis at the New York-
based firm, wrote in an e-mail on Aug. 18. “In a  bull market ,
when investors are differentiating, we see low or falling
correlation.”  Correlation among S&P 500 stocks exceeded 0.78 twice
previously, according to MF Global. After the first time, on
Dec. 1, 2008, the S&P 500 declined 17 percent to a 12-year low
on March 9, 2009. Correlation peaked again on July 26, 2010,
when the benchmark slipped 6.1 percent over the next month, data
compiled by MF Global and Bloomberg show.  Alcoa gained 2.1 percent to $11.45 in early trading today
as aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin and zinc all rose on the
London Metal Exchange.  Barrick Gold Gains  Barrick Gold, the world’s largest miner of the precious
metal, climbed 2.5 percent to $52.03 in German trading. Gold
rallied for a sixth straight day to an all-time high as a global
economic slowdown and the European debt crisis boosted demand
for a haven.  Schlumberger gained 1.6 percent to $74.26 in Paris as rebel
fighters reached the Libyan capital Tripoli. The overthrow of
 Muammar Qaddafi  may allow oil producers to start fields closed
by the civil war.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S. oil
company, added 0.8 percent to $70.34 in  Germany , while Chevron
Corp., the second-biggest, increased 1.5 percent to $94.66 in
German trading.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  rose 1.5 percent to $15.31 in early New
York trading after the world’s largest maker of networking
equipment said it intends to acquire service-fulfillment
software assets and employees from the U.K. subsidiary of
Helsinki, Finland-based Comptel Oyj.  To contact the reporters on this story:
