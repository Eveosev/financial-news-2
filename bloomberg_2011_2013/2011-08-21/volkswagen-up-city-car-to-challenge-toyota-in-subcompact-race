Volkswagen AG (VOW)  will roll out the new
Up! city car next month to tap growing demand for small, fuel-
efficient vehicles as  Europe ’s biggest automaker aims to claim
the industry’s top global sales position.  The Up! will be unveiled Sept. 12 at the Frankfurt auto
show and go on sale in Europe in December, VW said today in an
e-mail. The four-seat model, which will compete with  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Aygo subcompact and PSA Peugeot Citroen’s C1 mini,
will cost about 9,500 euros ($13,600), said a person familiar
with the product who declined to be identified because the price
has not yet been officially announced.  The Up! will be the first VW brand car built entirely from
scratch to come to market under Chief Executive Officer  Martin Winterkorn ’s leadership. The vehicle is strategically important
for Winterkorn, who took over in January of 2007, because
customer demand for compact vehicles is increasing and
governments are pushing carmakers to lower emissions.  “It’s a valuable addition to VW’s broad product
portfolio,” said  Tim Schuldt , a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Equinet AG who recommends buying VW stock. “Small vehicles are
becoming ever more important. The Up! will create a whole new
model line with good potential to penetrate markets.”  Wolfsburg, Germany-based VW is forecasting a 5 percent
increase in global deliveries this year after selling a record
7.2 million cars, sport-utility vehicles and vans in 2010. VW’s
group sales rose 16 percent last month to 665,600, extending
seven-month gains by 14 percent to 4.75 million, the company
said Aug. 19.  Cheapest Car  The Up!, which will be built in Bratislava, Slovakia, where
VW also makes bodies for Porsche AG’s best-selling Cayenne SUV,
is 3.54 meters (11.6 feet) long and 1.64 meters wide, marginally
bigger than the Aygo which measures 3.42 meters and 1.62 meters.  VW’s smallest and cheapest model will have a three-cylinder
engine, delivering as much as 75 horsepower, and be furnished
with an emergency-brake function to avoid collisions at speeds
of less than 30 kilometers per hour (18 mph). VW aims to
introduce an electric-powered Up! by 2013, the carmaker has
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
