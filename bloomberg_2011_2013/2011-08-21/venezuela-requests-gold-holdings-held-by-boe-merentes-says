Venezuela ’s central bank has
requested its 99 tons of gold holdings from the Bank of England,
according to a bank statement sent by e-mail, citing the
institution’s president Nelson Merentes.  “We’ve contacted the Bank of England and the corresponding
protocols have been initiated to complete this operation as soon
as possible,” Merentes said, according to the statement. “Once
that’s done, the shipments will begin by sea.”  Chavez ordered the central bank Aug. 17 to repatriate $11
billion of  gold reserves  held in developed nations’
institutions. Venezuela holds 211 tons of its 365 tons of gold
reserves in U.S., European, Canadian and Swiss Banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
