BayernLB, the German state-owned
bank that is in discussions with the European Commission about
its restructuring, said the risk shield for its asset-backed
securities portfolio remains in place.  During the financial crisis, BayernLB needed 10 billion
euros ($14.4 billion) in fresh capital and a risk shield for its
portfolio of asset-backed securities from the state of Bavaria,
which now owns the lender. Under the terms of the risk shield,
the bank is responsible for the first 1.2 billion euros in
losses while Bavaria would cover the next 4.8 billion euros.  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported on Aug. 19 that Bavarian
politicians are asking BayernLB to take a higher share of the
risk shield.  To contact the reporters on this story:
