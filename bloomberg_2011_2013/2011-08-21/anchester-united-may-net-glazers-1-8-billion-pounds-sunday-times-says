The U.S. owners of  Manchester United 
may net 1.82 billion pounds ($3 billion) when they sell shares
in the English Premier League soccer team in Asia, the  Sunday
Times  reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Florida-based Glazer family believes the club will be
valued at 2.4 billion pounds when they sell a 25 percent stake
on the Singapore stock market, the newspaper said.  Some of the 600 million pounds the family plans to raise
will be used to pay off loans, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
