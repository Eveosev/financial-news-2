Air traffic in the U.S. Northeast
was snarled by a series of thunderstorms that delayed planes
flying into  New York , Philadelphia and Newark,  New Jersey ,
today, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.  At least 283 flights, most of them into or out of New York
and Newark were canceled as of 1 p.m. local time, according to
FlightAware, a Houston-based airline-tracking company. Flash
flood watches and severe thunderstorm warnings have been issued
from New York to  Washington , according to the  National Weather
Service .  A thunderstorm near Parsippany, New Jersey, this afternoon
prompted the weather service to warn people to stay indoors.  “This is a dangerous storm, if you are in its path prepare
immediately for damaging winds, destructive hail and deadly
cloud to ground lightning,” the bulletin said.  There was a 30 percent chance of high winds and hail for an
area from New York to northern  Virginia  today and a 5 percent
chance tornadoes could form, according to the  U.S. Storm
Prediction Center  in Norman,  Oklahoma . Flights to Newark and
John F. Kennedy international airports were being delayed by 80
minutes or more, according to the FAA.  Flights to La Guardia Airport were experiencing delays of
43 minutes and about 20-minute delays were reported in
Philadelphia because of the storms, according to the FAA
website.  A 77 mile-per-hour (124-kilometer) wind gust was reported
at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and trees and limbs were
reported down across that state and Maryland, the storm center
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
