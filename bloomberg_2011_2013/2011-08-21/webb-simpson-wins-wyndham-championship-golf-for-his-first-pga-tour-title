Webb Simpson won his first title on
golf’s U.S.  PGA Tour  by capturing the Wyndham Championship, the
last regular-season tournament.  Simpson shot a 3-under 67 in the final round yesterday at
 Sedgefield Country Club  in Greensboro,  North Carolina , for a
four-round score of 18-under-par 262. He finished three shots
ahead of fellow American George McNeill, who had a 64, the best
round of the day. Another American, Tommy Gainey, was third at
14 under.  “I never thought that winning on the PGA Tour would be
this hard, all the pressure and everything that goes on to win a
 golf tournament , but I’m extremely pleased and I really love the
way I finished,” Simpson said in a news conference.  The victory, worth $918,000, elevated Simpson nine places
to third in the season-long FedEx Cup playoff standings. The top
125 players qualified for  the Barclays , which begins Aug. 25 at
Plainfield Country Club in Edison,  New Jersey . Three more
playoff events follow, each with a smaller field, culminating in
the 30-player Tour Championship. The winner of the FedEx Cup
receives a $10 million bonus.  Camilo Villegas of  Colombia  climbed to 109th in the playoff
standings after beginning the tournament in 125th place. The
Colombian shot a 4-under 66 yesterday to advance to 12 under and
a tie for ninth place in the tournament.  Two-time major champion  Padraig Harrington  of Ireland, who
started in 130th place in the playoff standings, reached  124th 
after a 2-under 68 took him to 6 under par and a tie for 47th
place in the Wyndham Championship.  McGirt Grabs Spot  American William McGirt finished a shot behind Harrington,
enough to secure the 32-year-old the final spot at the Barclays.
 South Africa ’s Ernie Els played himself into the postseason by
finishing 118th in the standings after beginning the tournament
126th.  “It’s been the longest afternoon of my life,” McGirt told
reporters. “Just sitting around and waiting, knowing there’s
nothing you can do, you just drive yourself crazy and that’s
what I did all afternoon.”  American Justin Leonard, the 1997 British Open champion,
needed to climb 17 places to make the playoffs. A bogey on the
final hole meant he rose 16 spots to 126th.  “To try and wait until this week to make it through is
just -- you know, I mean, come on,” Leonard told reporters. “I
had 25 other weeks to play like this.”  John Mallinger began the tournament in 212th place in the
FedEx standings and needed to finish second to make the
Barclays. He bogeyed the 11th to drop into a tie for second
place and then fell out of contention by also dropping shots at
the 13th, 14th and 18th holes. The American finished in a tie
for 12th at the Wyndham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
