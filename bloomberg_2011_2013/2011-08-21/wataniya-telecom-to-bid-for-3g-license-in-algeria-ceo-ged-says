Wataniya Telecom Algerie,  Algeria ’s
third-biggest mobile-phone company known as Nedjma, will bid for
the North African country’s 3G license at a tender planned for
early 2012, Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ged said.  Nedjma is “committed to increasing our investments to
fulfill all the license obligations as would be set and decided
by the Algerian government,” Ged said in an interview in
Algiers yesterday.  Algeria’s Post and Telecommunications Minister Moussa
Benhamadi last week said that the tender specifications will be
available by mid-September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
