Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) , an
Egyptian luxury real-estate developer, fell to the lowest level
in more than three-months after reporting a six-month loss.  The shares of the Cairo-based company retreated 3.8 percent
to 1.77 Egyptian pounds at the 1:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the
lowest level since May 16. That gave the company a market value
of 1.86 billion pounds ($312 million). The benchmark  EGX 30
Index (EGX30)  declined 3.2 percent.  Palm Hills reported a 81.4 million-pound net loss for the
period that ended June 30 after a profit of 191.4 million a
year-earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
