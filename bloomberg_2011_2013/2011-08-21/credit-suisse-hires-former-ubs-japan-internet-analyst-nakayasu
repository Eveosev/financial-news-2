Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  hired Yuki Nakayasu, a former analyst at larger rival  UBS AG (UBSN) , to cover
Japan’s Internet industry as part of efforts to expand equity
research in the country.  Nakayasu, 29, joined  Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank
today after covering the semiconductor, information technology
services and games industries at UBS, according to an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Isamu Kajino, a Tokyo-based
spokesman at Credit Suisse, confirmed the contents of the
document, declining to comment further.  Credit Suisse aims to increase the number of Japanese
companies it studies to 285 from 227 by Dec. 31, Tim Shanagher,
head of Japan equity research, said in an interview this month.
The bank is adding coverage in the Internet, auto parts, medical
devices, food, consumer products and retail industries, he said.  Nakayasu joined UBS after graduating from  Kyoto University 
in 2006. Credit Suisse is looking for a Japanese banking
industry analyst to replace Shinichi Ina, who resigned in July.
The bank has also hired an equity strategist whose appointment
will be announced at a later date, Shanagher said.  Zurich-based Credit Suisse aims to be one of the top three
overseas firms in equity research in  Japan  by 2013, he said.
Credit Suisse is currently sixth among foreign firms in Japan
and eighth overall, according to an Institutional Investor
survey published in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
