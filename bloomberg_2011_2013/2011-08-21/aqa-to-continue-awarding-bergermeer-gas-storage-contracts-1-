Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-run utility known as Taqa, said it will continue to award
natural-gas storage contracts at the Bergermeer project in the
Netherlands according to this year’s schedule.  The Dutch Council of State temporarily suspended the
underground gas storage project pending a review of objections
by parties including local authorities, the court said in a
statement on its website on Aug. 8. The “final verdict” of the
Dutch Council is expected in early 2012, Taqa said in an e-
mailed statement today.  “The project partners TAQA and Energie Beheer Nederland
are confident that the National Zoning Plan will be upheld in
the final appeal decision by the Council of State,” the company
said.  The Bergermeer gas-storage field, which will begin
operations in 2014, will offer 46 terrawatt-hours of gas storage
capacity, almost doubling the  Netherlands ’ total, Taqa said in
the statement. The company will this year start awarding up to
11.3 terrawatt-hours of storage capacity for 2014 and will hold
an additional open season next year for space starting in 2015.  The shares fell as much as 4.1 percent and traded 0.8
percent lower at 1.2 dirhams at 12:31 p.m. in  Abu Dhabi . The
stock has lost 19 percent this year, compared with a 5.9 percent
decline in the emirate’s benchmark ADX General Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
