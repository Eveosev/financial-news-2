Iran  and  Venezuela  started
construction on a petrochemical complex in the southern Iranian
province of Bushehr,  Press TV  reported, citing National Iranian
Petrochemical Organization Managing Director Abdolhossein Bayat.  The countries are building a methanol unit in the southern
port town of Assaluyeh, Bayat said yesterday, according to a
report published on the website of the state-run news channel.
Agreements for a similar project in the South American country
have yet to be completed, he said, without giving details of the
costs.  Iran and Venezuela agreed in October to jointly build
petrochemical plants and for Venezuela’s state oil company,
Petroleos de Venezuela SA, to participate in Iran’s South Pars
natural-gas field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
