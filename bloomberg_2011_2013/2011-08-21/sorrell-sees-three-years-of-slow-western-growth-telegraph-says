The world’s Western economies face
three years of slow growth rather than a double-dip recession,
 WPP Plc (WPP)  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Sorrell  said, according
to the Sunday Telegraph.  Euro contagion “is of concern again” after German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy
rejected measures to assist the continent’s ailing economies,
such as issuing a bond across the entire euro area or increasing
the size of Europe’s bailout fund, the U.K. newspaper reported,
citing Sorrell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
