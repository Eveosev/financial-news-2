Novak Djokovic said he’ll work on
his recovery from a shoulder injury ahead of next week’s  U.S.
Open  after his 2011 Masters series streak ended when he retired
from the Western & Southern Open final.  World No. 4  Andy Murray  led 6-4, 3-0 in Cincinnati
yesterday when top-ranked Djokovic quit the match. It was only
the  second loss  of the year for the Australian Open and
Wimbledon champion, who has won 57 matches this season.  “Shoulder could not take it anymore, and it didn’t make
sense to continue,” Djokovic said on  Twitter . “I will work on
the recovery of my shoulder in next 7, 8 days, and I hope and
believe that everything is going to be ready for U.S. Open.”  The year’s final Grand Slam tennis tournament runs Aug. 29-
Sept. 11 at the National Tennis Center in  New York , where
Djokovic is a two-time runner-up.  The 24-year-old Djokovic, who had been seeking his 10th
title in 2011, fell to 57-2 after also losing to  Roger Federer 
in the semifinals of the  French Open . Five of his nine
tournament wins have come in Masters 1000 events, the tier below
the Grand Slams in prize money and prestige.  It was Murray’s second title of the year and second in
Cincinnati after also defeating Djokovic in the 2008 final. The
24-year-old Briton improved his career head-to-head record to 4-
6 against the Serb.  “I would have obviously liked to have won by finishing the
match,” Murray said in a news conference. “But it happens
sometimes. I have to look at the week as a whole. It’s been a
very good week.”  Russia’s  Maria Sharapova , the 2006 U.S. Open champion, took
the women’s title in Cincinnati by beating Jelena Jankovic of
Serbia 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-3.  Sharapova, the No. 4 seed, fought back from a set and 0-2
down to win her 24th career title in what was the longest final
on the WTA Tour this season at two hours and 49 minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
