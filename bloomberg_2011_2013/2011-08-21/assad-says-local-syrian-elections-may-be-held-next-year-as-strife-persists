Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,
speaking in an interview with state television, said changes to
the country’s constitution are still being studied and local
elections may be held in February.  Assad said people were free to form parties and that  Syria 
aimed to be more inclusive of the country’s youth.  He said that any attack on the country would result in
“huge” consequences.  Assad, who wore a dark suit and was interviewed by two
state journalists, said the Obama administration and other
governments had no right to call for his removal because he was
appointed by the Syrian people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
