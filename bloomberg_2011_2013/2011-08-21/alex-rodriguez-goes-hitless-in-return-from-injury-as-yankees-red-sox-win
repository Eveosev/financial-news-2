Alex Rodriguez  went hitless in five
at-bats in his Yankees return after missing 38 games following
knee surgery as New York won 3-0 in Minnesota.  The Yankees (77-48) maintained their half-game lead over
Boston in the American League East division. The  Red Sox  won 6-1
yesterday at Kansas City.  Rodriguez, 36, who is sixth on Major League Baseball’s
career list with 626 home runs, grounded out twice to shortstop,
popped out twice and hit a fly ball to center field.  “I was happy with the way I saw the ball and happy with my
balance,” Rodriguez, a 14-time All-Star, told reporters. “I
got a lot of good pitches to hit and just missed them by a
little bit. But I liked the way I felt up there.”  Ivan Nova allowed five hits in seven innings to improve to
13-4 for the Yankees.  Mariano Rivera  pitched a perfect ninth
inning, striking out two, for his 33rd save of the season.  Curtis Granderson  and Mark Teixeira hit back-to-back solo
home runs in the seventh inning for the Yankees. Granderson’s
inside-the-park home run was his 35th of the season. Teixeira’s
was his 34th.  Carl Crawford and Darnell McDonald hit home runs for the
Red Sox (77-49).  Jon Lester  allowed one run in six innings to
make his record 13-6 this season.  In other American League games, Detroit beat Cleveland 8-7
to extend its lead to 4 1/2 games in the Central division; the
Los Angeles Angels won 7-1 against Baltimore to move within four
games of West division leader Texas, which lost 10-0 at the
Chicago White Sox; Tampa Bay won 8-7 against Seattle and Toronto
defeated Oakland 1-0.  Brewers Win  Prince Fielder drove in two runs as the National League
Central division leaders, the  Milwaukee Brewers , won 6-2 at the
 New York  Mets. Fielder drove in eight runs as the Brewers swept
the three-game series at Citi Field.  The San Francisco Giants, who earlier in the day placed
reliever Brian Wilson on the 15-day disabled list with a
strained elbow, won 6-4 in 11 innings at Houston to move within
1 1/2 games of NL West division leader Arizona, which lost 1-0
at Atlanta for its fifth straight defeat.  In other National League games, it was Washington 5,
Philadelphia 4 in 10 innings; Cincinnati 5, Pittsburgh 4;
Colorado 5, the Los Angeles Dodgers 3; San Diego 4, Florida 3,
and St. Louis 6, the Chicago Cubs 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
