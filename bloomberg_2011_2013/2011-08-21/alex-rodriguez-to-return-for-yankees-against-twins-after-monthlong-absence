     Aug. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Alex Rodriguez  will return for the
New York Yankees today after missing more than a month following
knee surgery.  Rodriguez, 36, was injured in a game against the  Chicago
Cubs  on June 19 and had surgery on July 11. Before going on the
disabled list, he hadnâ€™t hit a home run in 85 at-bats, the
longest single-season drought of his career. Rodriguez ranks
sixth in Major League Baseball history with 626 home runs.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  named Rodriguez as third
baseman for the last of four games against the  Minnesota Twins 
in  Minneapolis  today.  The Yankees lead the  Boston Red Sox  by half a game atop the
American League East Division. Boston wraps up a four-game
series at the  Kansas City Royals  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
