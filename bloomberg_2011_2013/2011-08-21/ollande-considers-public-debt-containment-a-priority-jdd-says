Francois Hollande , a contender for
the Socialist Party’s 2012 French presidential nomination,
considers debt containment a priority although he opposes a
constitutional amendment limiting budget deficits,  Le Journal du
Dimanche  reported, citing Hollande.  “We are all pursuing the same goal, that of debt
containment, but we aren’t laying out the same road to get
there,” the weekly newspaper cited Hollande as saying in an
 interview  published today.  The former Socialist Party also said he would pass a budget
plan respecting European deficit-reduction targets if he is
elected president.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is pushing to include debt
limits in the country’s constitution to help support France’s
top credit rating. Hollande said economic growth, budget
containment and  tax reform  would be his economic policy
priorities as president, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
