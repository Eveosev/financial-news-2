The  San Francisco Giants  put
reliever  Brian Wilson  on the disabled list, the latest injury
blow as the team tries to defend its World Series championship.  Wilson, 29, who has not pitched since Aug. 15 because of a
strained right elbow, will be eligible to return to the team on
Aug. 31. The three-time All-Star has 35 saves in 40
opportunities and a 6-4 record this season.  Wilson, who already is signed for next season at $8.5
million, had 48 saves last season to lead  Major League Baseball 
and six more in the postseason as the Giants won their first
championship since 1954. He also began this season on the
disabled list with a strained left side.  “Nobody wants to go on the disabled list right now. But we
have to take care of him,” Giants head athletic trainer Dave
Groeschner told reporters. “It’s not just these next six weeks,
it’s the next year and the year after.”  San Francisco  currently has nine players on the disabled
list, including catcher Buster Posey and outfielder Carlos Beltran -- who was obtained in a July trade from the  New York
Mets  in an effort to spark the team’s offense, which ranks last
in the National League with 439 runs scored this season.  The Giants (68-60), who have lost 17 of their last 23
games, are 1 1/2 games behind National League West division
leader Arizona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
