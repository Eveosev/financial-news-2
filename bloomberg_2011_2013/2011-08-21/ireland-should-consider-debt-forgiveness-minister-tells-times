Ireland should examine a proposal by
Morgan Kelly, an economics professor at University College
Dublin, for debt forgiveness for some of the country’s
homeowners,  Willie Penrose , a junior minister, told the Sunday
Times.  If the amount involved is as reasonable as Kelly said, it
would be “foolhardy” not to examine it thoroughly, Penrose
told the newspaper. The debt burden on mortgage holders is
causing huge difficulties for families and isn’t easing, he also
told the Times.  Kelly, dubbed Ireland’s Dr. Doom after forecasting the
collapse of the country’s housing boom, said on Aug. 18 that
debt forgiveness of 5 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to 6 billion
euros may solve most of Ireland’s banking issues with 55 billion
euros of owner-occupied mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
