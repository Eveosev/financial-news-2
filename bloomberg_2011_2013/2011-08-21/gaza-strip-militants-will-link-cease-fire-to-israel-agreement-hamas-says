Militant Palestinian groups in the
 Gaza Strip  have agreed to stop firing rockets at southern
Israeli towns and cities on the condition Israel “gives
positive answers,” said Taher al-Nounou, a spokesman for Hamas
that rules the Gaza Strip. He declined to elaborate.  Egypt  is trying to mediate a ceasefire between the two
sides after violence escalated following attacks near Israel’s
resort city of Eilat on Aug. 18 that left eight Israelis dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
