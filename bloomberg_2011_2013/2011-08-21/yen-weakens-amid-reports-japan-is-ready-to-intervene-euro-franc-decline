The yen weakened from almost its
postwar record against the dollar and the Swiss franc tumbled
amid speculation policy makers in both countries will seek to
curb gains in their currencies that are hurting exporters.  The dollar gained versus the euro as stocks pared advances,
while the  New Zealand dollar  and Swedish krona rose versus all
of their most-traded peers. The yen dropped the most in two
weeks after Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said he’s
ready to take decisive steps to stem its strength. Most Swiss
support intervention by their central bank to stop gains in the
franc, the newspaper  SonntagsZeitung  reported yesterday.  “We’ve had further comments by Noda and other Japanese
officials indicating a lack of comfort with yen strength,” said
 Michael Woolfolk , senior currency strategist in New York at Bank
of New York Mellon Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank.
“Renewed jawboning has contributed to yen weakness.”  The yen fell as much as 0.9 percent to 77.21 per dollar
before trading 0.3 percent weaker at 76.78 at 11:51 a.m. in  New
York . The intraday drop was the biggest since Aug. 4, the day
 Japan  sold its currency. The Japanese currency depreciated 0.2
percent to 110.39 per euro.  The euro was down 0.1 percent to $1.4383, after gaining
earlier as much as 0.3 percent, versus $1.4397 on Aug. 19.  The franc declined 0.3 percent to 1.1334 per euro, and was
0.4 percent weaker at 78.80 centimes per dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.2 percent after
earlier climbing as much as 2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
