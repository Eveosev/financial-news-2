The German  Finance Ministry 
calculates that common euro bonds would cost Germany billions of
euros as  interest rates  increase,  Spiegel  reported.  Higher interest payments would cost as much as 2.5 billion
euros ($3.6 billion) in the first year and double in the second,
finance ministry said, according to the German magazine. In the
tenth year, the extra costs would reach 20 billion euros to 25
billion euros, the magazine said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
