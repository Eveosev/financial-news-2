Canada’s military has suspended
Operation Nanook, an annual Arctic sovereignty exercise, and is
redirecting its resources to assist investigators after 12
people died in the crash of a 737 passenger flight in Resolute
Bay, Nunavut, according to Captain Andrew Hennessy.  About 500 army, navy and air force members were already in
Resolute Bay, about 2,100 miles northwest of  Montreal , for the
exercises when the Boeing 737-200 crashed en route from
Yellowknife. The airline, First Air, based in Kanata, Ontario,
confirmed the deaths in an e-mailed statement and said three
people survived.  “Operation Nanook has been suspended and all the Canadian
forces’ assets in the vicinity here have been re-tasked to
assist in the recovery of the First Air aircraft,” Hennessy
said by phone from Resolute Bay. He said about 1,000 military
personnel take part in the exercises.  CH-146 Griffin helicopters, a Sea King helicopter and a
Canadian Coast Guard helicopter assisted in the rescue, and
military doctors and nurses set up a medical station to treat
victims, Hennessy said.  “This is the priority right now and will be for the next
few days,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
