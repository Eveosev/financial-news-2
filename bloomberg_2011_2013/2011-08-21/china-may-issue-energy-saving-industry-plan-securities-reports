China may as early as next month
release the nationâ€™s plan for developing the energy-saving and
environmental protection industry for the five-year period
through 2015, the China Securities Journal reported today,
citing an unidentified person.  The plan, which will be submitted to the State Council,
will include financial and tax policies to support the industry,
according to the Beijing-based newspaper. Companies in the
industry may have a preferential corporate income tax rate of 15
percent, according to the report.  The plan would cover companies that produce equipment
designed to help conserve energy and reduce pollution, according
