Hans-Werner Sinn, head of the
Munich-based Ifo economic institute, rejected common euro bonds
as a way of supporting countries in crisis, according to an
article published by  Handelsblatt .  Pooling debt doesnâ€™t make the burden smaller and there is
no alternative to everyone paying their own debt, Sinn wrote in
the German newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
