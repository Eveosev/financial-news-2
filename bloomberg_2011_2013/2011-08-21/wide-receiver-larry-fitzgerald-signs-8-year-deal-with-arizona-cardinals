Five-time Pro Bowl selection Larry Fitzgerald agreed to an eight-year deal that keeps the wide
receiver with the  Arizona Cardinals  through 2018.  Terms of the contract weren’t disclosed by the National
Football League team. ESPN reported the deal is worth $120
million with $50 million guaranteed, tying him with Oakland
Raiders’ Richard Seymour for the fifth-highest average among
players.  Fitzgerald, 27, has recorded at least 90 receptions in each
of the last four seasons and has four consecutive 1,000-yard
receiving seasons and five total in his career. His 65
touchdowns put him one score behind franchise-leading Roy Green.  Fitzgerald, who was picked third overall by the Cardinals
in the 2004  NFL Draft , became the franchise’s all-time
receptions leader with 613 last season and moved into second
place on the franchise career receiving yardage list with 8,204
yards, trailing only Roy Green who had 8,497 yards.  During 2005 when he was selected to his first  Pro Bowl , he
set a franchise single-season record with 103 receptions for
1,409 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also became the youngest
receiver in NFL history to record a 100-catch campaign that
season when he was 22 years old.  Fitzgerald played in 108 regular season games with 107
starts and has 613 receptions for 8,204 yards with 65 touchdowns
during his career. He also played in six postseason games and
has 42 receptions for 705 yards and nine touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
