Anglo Irish Bank  Corp. said it
hasn’t received a request to submit a revised report on bonus
payments to senior employees and that a report that the Irish
government asked it do so is “inaccurate.”  The bank submitted a 20-page report to the Department of
Finance following a question raised by a lawmaker in parliament
and said in an e-mailed statement that in the report it provided
all the information it had previously provided to the Department
“and pointed out very clearly that no discrepancies existed in
the information provided.”  Ireland’s Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  ordered Anglo
Irish Bank to resubmit a report on bonus payments to senior
staff, the Sunday Independent reported, citing a ministry
spokesman. Noonan wants “clarity” on all extra payments above
basic salaries awarded to employees of the nationalized bank,
the Dublin-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
