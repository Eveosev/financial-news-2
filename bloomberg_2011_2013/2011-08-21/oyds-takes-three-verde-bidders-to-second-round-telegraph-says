Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  took all
three confirmed bidders for the 632 branches it’s selling as
part of an operation called Project Verde to the second round,
the Sunday Telegraph  said , without saying where it got the
information.  NBNK Investments Plc (NBNK) , Co-Operative Financial Services Ltd.
and Hugh Osmond’s Sun Capital Partners Ltd. will this week
receive detailed trading and operating data from the branches,
the newspaper said. The branches are expected to sell for 2.5
billion pounds ($4.1 billion) to 3 billion pounds and a deadline
for the second round was set for Sept. 30, it reported.  A spokeswoman for Lloyds declined to comment when contacted
by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
