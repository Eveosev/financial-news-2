SABMiller Plc (SAB)  has spent as much as
120 million pounds ($198 million) buying  Foster’s Group Ltd. (FGL) 
shares in recent days as part of a A$11.2 billion ($11.7
billion) hostile bid for the Australian brewer, the Sunday
Telegraph  said , without saying where it got the information.  Banks acting for SAB have been purchasing small blocks of
shares from hedge fund managers at prices below the A$4.90-a-
share offer price, the newspaper said. SABMiller’s stake is
still below disclosable levels, it reported.  Spokesmen for SABMiller, in London, and Foster’s, in
Melbourne, declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
