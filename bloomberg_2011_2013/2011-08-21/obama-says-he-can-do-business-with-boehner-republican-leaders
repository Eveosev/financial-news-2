President  Barack Obama  said progress
in efforts to address unemployment and economic growth may hinge
on House Speaker  John Boehner ’s ability to move his Republican
caucus to make difficult decisions to move the country forward.  “The issue’s not going to be whether I can do business
with John Boehner,” Obama said in an interview broadcast today
on CBS’s “Sunday Morning” program. “The issue is if John
Boehner and I are able to come to agreement, can he sell it
among his fellow Republicans inside the  House of
Representatives . And so far, at least, that’s proven to be
difficult.”  Obama, who did the CBS interview while traveling in
Minnesota, Iowa and  Illinois  last week, was responding to a
question about whether he can reach a deal with Republicans on
the jobs and growth package he plans to introduce after Labor
Day. He said his dealings with Boehner, an Ohio Republican, over
efforts to raise the nation’s debt ceiling raises questions
about Republicans’ willingness to compromise.  “I’m willing to at least go to my party, to go to my
fellow Democrats and say to them, ‘You know what, even if
there’s some things that you think aren’t good short-term
politics, this is good for the country,’” Obama said. “If
that’s happening on both sides, there’s no reason why we can’t
solve problems.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
