EnQuest Plc (ENQ)  is in talks with  BP Plc (BP/) 
to buy assets worth as much as 400 million pounds ($659
million), the Mail on Sunday reported, without saying where it
got the information.  BP last year offered for sale several aging oil and gas
fields in the North Sea region, where EnQuest is focuses its
business, including the first-ever commercial discovery in the
British sector of the North Sea at West Sole, the U.K. newspaper
said.  EnQuest and BP declined to comment, the Mail on Sunday
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
