German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
called on Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  to give up power to help
end the conflict that is dividing his nation.  Libyan anti-Qaddafi rebels have made “major advances,”
Merkel said in a ZDF television interview in Berlin today. “Of
course we are glad. I’ve said for a long time that Qaddafi has
lost his legitimacy, and it would be good if he gave up as
quickly as possible to avoid bloodshed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
