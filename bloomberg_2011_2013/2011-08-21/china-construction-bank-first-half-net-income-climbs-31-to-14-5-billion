China Construction Bank Corp. (939) , the
world’s second-largest lender by market value, said first-half
profit jumped 31 percent to a record as credit demand climbed.  Net income rose to 92.8 billion yuan ($14.5 billion), or
0.37 yuan a share, from 70.7 billion yuan, or 0.3 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based lender said in a statement to the
Shanghai stock exchange yesterday. Profit was in line with the
91.5 billion yuan median estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Construction Bank joined rival Bank of Communications Co.
in reporting record first-half profit as loan demand climbed in
the world’s second-largest economy. Lending profitability also
improved after  China  raised  interest rates  three times this
year. Still, the lender’s Hong Kong-listed shares lost about a
quarter of their value this year on concern defaults may climb.  “Looking forward, investors are concerned about Chinese
banks’ earnings sustainability and asset quality,” said Stanley Li, an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd. in  Hong Kong ,
said today by phone. “Fee income might be affected by the
tougher regulations proposed on the sale of wealth management
products. The market is also concerned about what level the
 credit quality  may deteriorate to.”  China’s banking regulator has asked lenders to increase
capital buffers and accelerate loan collection schedules for
local government debt amid mounting concern that a record $2.7
trillion two-year credit boom started in 2009 will result in
soaring defaults if the economy falters. China is also
tightening oversight of wealth-management services, banning
practices such as banks buying each other’s products to bypass
limits on deposit rates and loan quotas.  Default Concerns  Shares of Construction Bank dropped almost 1 percent to
HK$5.22 as of 10:31 a.m. local time, compared with a 0.9 percent
gain in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The stock has declined 25
percent this year.  Construction Bank’s non-performing loan ratio narrowed to
1.03 percent from 1.14 percent at the beginning of the year,
while the provision coverage ratio increased to 244.68 percent
of non-performing loans from 221.14 percent.  Net interest income, or revenue from lending minus payments
to depositors, climbed 24 percent to 145.7 billion yuan while
net fee and commission income increased 42 percent to 47.7
billion yuan. Net interest margin, a measure of lending
profitability, widened to 2.66 percent from 2.41 percent a year
ago.  Shareholders of the state-controlled lender, established in
1954 to fund roads, bridges, dams and other public works,
approved a plan to raise as much as 80 billion yuan from the
sale of yuan-denominated subordinated notes by the end of August
2013 to replenish capital, the bank said Aug. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
