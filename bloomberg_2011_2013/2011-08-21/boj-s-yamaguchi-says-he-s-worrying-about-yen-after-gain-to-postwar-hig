Hirohide Yamaguchi,  Bank of Japan 
deputy governor, said he’s “worrying” about the yen’s gains
after the currency strengthened to a post-World War II high
against the dollar amid global market turmoil.  Speaking in English on the sidelines of an economic forum
in Beijing today, he also said that a stronger currency won’t
“necessarily” damage the economy.  In Tokyo, the Bank of  Japan  sought to clarify that comment.
A press official said that while Yamaguchi doesn’t see currency
gains having a big impact on the economy immediately, he is
concerned at what the effect may eventually be.  The yen touched a postwar high of 75.95 per dollar last
week as investors sought refuge because of  Europe ’s debt crisis
and signs the global economic recovery is faltering. Finance
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  said Aug. 18 that he’s ready to take
“bold” action if needed, with currency gains crimping
exporters’ profits and threatening Japan’s recovery from the
March 11 earthquake.  In March, the currency advanced to 76.25 per dollar,
prompting a coordinated move by the Group of Seven nations to
sell yen. Japanese authorities followed up with a unilateral
move this month to weaken the currency.  Yamaguchi declined to comment on whether the government may
intervene again.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Jim McDonald  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
