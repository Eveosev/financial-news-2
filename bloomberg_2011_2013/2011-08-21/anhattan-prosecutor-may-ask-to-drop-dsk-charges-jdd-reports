Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. may ask a judge to dismiss sexual-assault charges
against  Dominique Strauss-Kahn ,  Le Journal du Dimanche  reported,
citing Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for the hotel housekeeper
accusing the former  International Monetary Fund  chief.  “We have no confidence about his willingness to go to
court,” the French weekly newspaper cited Wigdor as saying in
an interview published today. Wigdor confirmed that the
Manhattan prosecutor’s office has scheduled a meeting tomorrow
with the alleged victim, according to the newspaper.  Benjamin Brafman , Strauss-Kahn’s lawyer, has declined to
comment on whether the case might be dismissed at a hearing next
week or later.  The case is People v. Strauss-Kahn, 11-02526, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
