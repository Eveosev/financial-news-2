German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said the government has already agreed on tax cuts and
only the size of the reduction will be decided on in October,
 Bild  am Sonntag said, citing an interview with the minister.  The scale of cuts will depend on estimates of tax and
economic growth for the coming year, Roesler told the German
newspaper. The minister also said that child-care subsidies will
have to be examined because of the “tight” budgetary
situation, according to Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
