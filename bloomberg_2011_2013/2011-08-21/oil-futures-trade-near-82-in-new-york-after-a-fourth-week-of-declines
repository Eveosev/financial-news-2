Brent oil fell in  London , narrowing
its record premium to U.S. futures, as investors bet that Libyan
production may recover after rebels entered the capital city of
Tripoli in a push to force out leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  The European benchmark contract tumbled as much as 3
percent amid speculation Qaddafi’s regime is crumbling, and
New York crude extended a fourth week of declines. Libya’s
output dropped to 100,000 barrels a day last month, a Bloomberg
News survey showed. That’s less than 10 percent of the 1.59
million barrels the nation pumped in January, before the
uprising that started in February.  “The immediate reaction should be that you’ll see more
crude come onto the market” from  Libya , said  Jonathan Barratt ,
a managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney.
He predicts crude in New York will average $100 a barrel this
year. “In a market that has already seen inventories pick up,
it will just add weight to weakness in the complex.”  Brent oil for October settlement dropped as much as $3.25
to $105.37 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, and was at $105.59 at 4:37 p.m. Sydney time. The
contract was at a premium of $24.15 to U.S. futures, compared
with a record settlement of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  Crude for October delivery, the most actively traded
contract on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, fell $1.11 to
$81.30 a barrel in electronic trading. September futures, which
expire today, decreased 94 cents to $81.32. Front-month oil fell
3.7 percent last week, a fourth weekly decline. Prices have
slumped 29 percent from their 2011 peak on May 2.  ‘Room to Fall’  “Brent has a lot more room to fall,”  Victor Shum , a
senior principal at Purvin & Gertz Inc. in  Singapore , said in an
interview with Linzie Janis on Bloomberg Television’s “First
Look” today. “In the near-term, it could fall below $100. If
Qaddafi is gone in a matter of days, expectations are that
Libyan oil flow will resume quite quickly.”  London-traded crude advanced 19 percent in the first half
of 2011 as an armed rebellion against Qaddafi disrupted the
country’s supplies and prompted  Saudi Arabia  to push for
increased output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. Libyan rebels said they captured two of Qaddafi’s
sons as they pushed into Tripoli.  Brent is trading below its 200-day moving average,
signaling a breach of technical support, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This indicator is around $107.90 a barrel
today. Prices tend to extend declines when chart-support levels
are broken.  U.S. Futures  New York futures for October rose as much as 1.1 percent
earlier today on speculation that further measures by the U.S.
Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy will support demand for
fuel in the world’s biggest crude consumer. Prices slumped last
week after an Energy Department report showed U.S. oil
inventories increased 4.23 million barrels to 354 million in the
week ended Aug. 12. They were forecast to drop 500,000 barrels,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  Hedge funds  and other speculators cut wagers on rising
crude prices by 0.1 percent to 142,769 in the week ended Aug. 16,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report.  Tropical Storm Irene approached  Puerto Rico , heading for
the  Dominican Republic , and was expected to reach hurricane
strength today, according to a National Hurricane Center
advisory. Irene, with maximum winds of 70 miles (110 kilometers)
per hour, was about 35 miles southeast of  San Juan , Puerto Rico,
as of 1 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
