Umberto Bossi , leader of the Italy’s
governing coalition-member  Northern League  party, said he won’t
consider any changes to the country’s pensions system,  La Stampa 
reported.  Bossi, speaking in Alzano Lombardo, near Bergamo, said he
told Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in a phone call not to
touch pensions and that “we’ll find another way,” the
newspaper reported.  Lifting the retirement age is necessary, Angelino Alfano,
head of Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, said in an
interview with La Stampa. However, any decision will be taken
together with the Northern League, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
