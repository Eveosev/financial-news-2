National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , the
United Arab Emirates’ second-biggest bank, is part of a group
advising Kuwait on the development of Failaka island.  Other members include Pinsent Masons, WSP Environmental and
EC Harris Consultancy, Nicholas Gilani, co-head of investment
banking at the  Abu Dhabi  lender, said today in an interview.  Kuwait signed a 2.1 million dinar ($7.7 million) agreement
with a group led by the Abu Dhabi bank to conduct technical and
feasibility studies over 27 months for the development of
Failaka Island, state-run news agency  Kuna  reported on Aug. 18.
The planned transformation of the island into an international
tourist destination may cost as much as 500 million dinars, Kuna
said, citing Adel al-Roumi, head of  Kuwait ’s Partnerships
Technical Bureau.  To contact the reporter on this story:
