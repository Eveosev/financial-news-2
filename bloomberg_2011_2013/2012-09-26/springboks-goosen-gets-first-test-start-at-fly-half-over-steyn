South Africa  named fly-half Johan
Goosen for his first Test start in this weekend’s Rugby
Championship match against  Australia  in Pretoria.  The 20-year-old’s inclusion in place of Morne Steyn is one
of three changes to the team that took the field for the 21-11
loss in New Zealand 11 days ago.  “I’ve maintained from the outset that I won’t rush Johan,
but I feel he is now ready to start a Test for South Africa,”
Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer said in an e-mailed statement.
“I’m excited to see what he can bring.”  Eben Etzebeth and Andries Bekker will be in the second row
against the Wallabies on Sept. 29. Etzebeth returns after
missing the previous match because of a suspension.  Inside center Frans Steyn will begin the game if he passes
a fitness test on his injured ankle in two days. If he doesn’t,
Jaco Taute will make his Test debut, with Juan de Jongh called
to the bench.  World champion  New Zealand  tops the standings with 16
points and can secure the inaugural title with a victory in
 Argentina  in three days. Australia has eight points, South
Africa seven and Argentina three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
