Treasuries rose for an eighth day,
the longest run of gains in almost four years, as investors
seeking a refuge from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis bolstered
demand at the U.S. auction of $35 billion in five-year notes.  The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the
amount bid with the amount offered, was 3.06, versus an average
of 2.92 at the past 10 sales and the highest since April. Ten-
year notes rallied earlier as Spanish debt yields climbed toward
levels that prompted other European nations to seek bailouts.
The U.S. will sell $29 billion in seven-year notes tomorrow.  “It was a good auction,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of
Treasury trading at Bank of  Nova Scotia  in New York, which as
one of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealer is obliged to bid
in U.S. debt offerings. “It is suggesting more and more fear --
that things could spiral out of control in Europe. The demand
for dollars and Treasuries continues to rise.”  The  yield  on the current five-year note fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 0.61 percent at 5 p.m. in
New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices.  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  dropped six basis points
to 1.61 percent. The price of the 1.625 percent security
maturing in August 2022 increased 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face
amount, to 100 1/8.  The eight-day advance in 10-year prices is the longest
since December 2008, when the economy was deteriorating as the
financial crisis worsened. The gains have pared the benchmark
note’s loss for September to 0.6 percent, according to Bank of
American Merrill Lynch indexes.  Bond Yields  Thirty-year bond  yields slid seven basis points to 2.78
percent, the lowest level since Sept. 7. It was their eighth
straight daily drop, also the longest since December 2008.  Treasury volume reported today by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped to $300
billion, down from $303 billion yesterday. Daily volume has
averaged $241 billion in 2012. It touched $464 billion Sept. 13.  Spanish 10-year  bonds  slumped, pushing yields up the most
in almost two months, after Catalan President Artur Mas called
early elections yesterday. Spanish President  Mariano Rajoy 
rejected his demand for increased control of the region’s
revenue. Demonstrators clashed with police in  Madrid , while
Greeks protesting austerity staged a general strike.  “It’s the chaos in Europe,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “There’s still concern
about the global economy. Those things together may have helped
to bid Treasuries up. It’s the crisis that won’t go away.”  More Expensive  Treasuries were the most expensive in two months. The 10-
year term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed that
includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation,
was negative 0.97 percent, the most costly since July 25. A
negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value. The 2012 average is
negative 0.74 percent.  Today’s five-year note sale drew a  yield  of 0.647 percent,
compared with an average forecast of 0.664 percent in a
Bloomberg News survey of nine primary dealers. The record low
auction yield on the securities is 0.584 percent, set at the
July offering.  “Supply really hasn’t been a problem for people,” said
Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel
Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “Things are heating up
again in  Europe .”  Indirect Bidders  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 42 percent of the n at today’s sale,
compared with an average of 43.1 percent at the past 10
offerings. Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that
place their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 10.7
percent, versus a 10.1 percent average at the last 10 auctions.  Primary dealers bought 47.2 percent of the notes, the least
since the April offering.  Today’s auction was the second of three note sales this
week totaling $99 billion. The U.S. sold $35 billion in two-year
securities yesterday at a yield of 0.273 percent.  The drop in  Spain ’s 10-year bond sent the yield up as much
as 32 basis points, the most since Aug. 2, to 6.07 percent. It
touched a five-month low of 5.55 percent on Sept. 10.  Italy ’s
10-year yield rose 11 basis points to 5.21 percent, moving
higher for the fifth straight day.  German and British  government securities  rose as investors
sought safety, sending yields lower. The yield on 10-year German
bunds dropped 13 basis points to 1.46 percent, and 10-year U.K.
gilt yields decreased 13 basis points to 1.69 percent.  Inflation Outlook  Benchmark U.S. 10-year note  yields  dropped to the lowest
level in more than two weeks as gauges of inflation expectations
receded from the highs reached after the Fed announced a third
round of debt purchases, or quantitative easing, on Sept. 13.
The yields touched 1.61 percent, the least since Sept. 7,
falling below their 100- and 50-day moving averages of 1.64
percent.  The five-year, five-year forward  break-even rate , a measure
of the inflation outlook the Fed uses to help guide monetary
policy, was 2.74 percent. It has fallen from 2.88 percent on
Sept. 14, which was the most in 13 months. The 10-year average
is 2.75 percent.  The 10-year note yield has formed a double-top chart
pattern, suggesting the rally has further to run, CRT Capital
Group LLC said. The yield is poised to fall to 1.5 percent, and
possibly to the all-time low of 1.38, after it failed to rise
above 1.89 percent on Sept. 14, a level that represents the
second leg of the pattern and suggests selling momentum stalled,
said  Ian Lyngen , a CRT government-bond strategist in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . A double top occurs when a security makes two
consecutive peaks of about the same depth.  Mortgage Securities  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said after its September
meeting the central bank will buy mortgage-backed securities at
a pace of $40 billion per month until the labor market improves.  A measure of relative yields on mortgage securities that
guide U.S. home-loan rates was near a record low amid bets the
Fed will find a shortage of the bonds as it expands purchases. A
Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed mortgage
bonds trading closest to face value was 58 basis points higher
than an average of five- and 10-year Treasury rates. The record,
55 basis points, was reached yesterday.  “To get yields, investors are forced to take on credit
risk,”  said Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion
as co-head of government and mortgage-backed securities at
Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. “The unlimited QE has caused
yields to fall and mortgages to outperform. Investors are just
desperate for yields.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
