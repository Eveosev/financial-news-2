A report this morning by Politico chief political correspondent Roger Simon includes this  bombshel l about Republican vice presidential nominee  Paul Ryan : The "stench" reference comes from a  quote  that  Craig Robinson , a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party gave to the  New York  Times over the weekend: “I hate to say this, but if Ryan wants to run for national office again, he’ll probably have to wash the stench of Romney off of him.” Needless to say, the political press and blogosphere have jumped on the story: Times columnist  Paul Krugman : Tommy Christopher  of press-gossip site Mediaite: Joe Gandelman  of the Moderate Voice: Liberal radio personality  Taylor Marsh : Steve Benen  at MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's blog: David Ferguson  of the Raw Story: Clearly, a disaster for the Romney campaign, right? No, it was apparently a clumsy attempt at satire gone horribly awry. As  Ben Smith  of Buzzfeed, a former Politico blogger, tweeted: "So uh a lot of people seem not to have picked up that @politicoroger's column was satire." Put more succinctly by conservative blogger  JammieWearingFool : "Satire should actually be funny." Or, at least it should be pretty obvious. There is no underestimating the literal-mindedness of the American reader: Years ago when I worked at the Times we published a satirical op-ed column by Steve Martin riffing on the idea that a NASA Mars probe had discovered millions of kittens on the Red Planet. Shortly thereafter, a subscriber sent a terse letter to the editor asking us to "inform your science correspondent" that the lack of oxygen on Mars made kitten infestation highly unlikely. Naturally, no writer wants to put a blinking sign indicating "This Is a Joke" above his or her parody piece. But editors should realize that if there is even a chance that such a sign is necessary, it's probably best to spike the whole idea. Otherwise, you might end up fooling a lot of people, maybe even a  Nobel Prize winner . (Tobin Harshaw writes editorials for Bloomberg View. Follow him on  Twitter .)
