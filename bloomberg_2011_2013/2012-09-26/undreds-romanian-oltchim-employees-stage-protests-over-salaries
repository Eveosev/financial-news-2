Hundreds of workers at Romanian
state-owned chemical company  Oltchim SA (OLT)  staged a protest as the
government holds talks with media entrepreneur Dan Diaconescu to
keep the agreement for a majority stake from collapsing.  About 500 Oltchim employees gathered in front of the
chemical company’s headquarters in the southern city of Ramnicu
Valcea to demonstrate against unpaid salaries and a halt in
production triggered by the lack of working capital, according
to private television station  Realitatea TV .  Diaconescu, 44, a politician and owner of broadcaster OTV,
won an auction on Sept. 24 to buy the state’s 54.8 percent stake
in Oltchim and promised to pay about 203 million lei ($58
million) in a contract that needs to be signed by Oct. 1. Prime
Minister Victor Ponta said Diaconescu lacks the money.  The Cabinet will place Oltchim into special administration
should Diaconescu fail to secure the funding for the stake and
sign the purchase contract by the deadline.  Romania pledged to sell its holding in Oltchim and a
minority stake in  Transgaz SA (TGN) , the country’s natural-gas grid
operator, by the end of this month to get the International
Monetary Fund’s approval to unlock the next tranche of its
precautionary accord. The fund’s Washington-based board will
meet on Sept. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
