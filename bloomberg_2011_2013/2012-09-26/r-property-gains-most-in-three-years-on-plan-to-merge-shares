TR Property Investment Trust Plc’s (TRYS) 
sigma shares rose the most in more than three years in  London 
trading after the U.K.-based closed-end fund said it will
combine its two classes of stock.  The shares climbed as much as 7.1 pence, or 9.9 percent, to
79 pence, the most since April 2009. TR Property Plans to
convert the sigma shares into ordinary shares, the London-based
fund said in a statement today. The sigma shares will be valued
at 98 percent of their net asset value after deducting costs, TR
Property said.  “Because the ordinary shares are on a much lower discount,
the sigma shares are coming more into line,” said Chris Lunn, a
sales and corporate broker for Cenkos Securities Plc. Cenkos is
TR Property’s broker.  The ordinary shares fell as much as 2.7 percent to 160.20
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
