The ruble dropped the most in two
months as crude, Russia’s biggest export earner, retreated on
concern the global economic recovery will founder.  The ruble weakened 1.3 percent to 31.3700 versus the dollar
by 7 p.m. in Moscow, the most since July 23. The currency lost
0.4 percent versus the euro to 40.2666 and sank 0.9 percent
against the central bank’s euro-dollar basket.  Crude in  New York  dropped after a report showed rising U.S.
stockpiles and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
President  Charles Plosser  said a new stimulus plan probably
won’t boost economic growth. The Bank of  Spain  said the
country’s economy is shrinking at a “significant pace.”  “Externally, the ruble is influenced by the declining U.S.
market and oil,” Alexey Pogorelov, an economist at Credit
Suisse AG in Moscow, said by telephone. “Domestically, the
corporate tax period is coming to an end.”  Russian companies have already bought the rubles they need
to pay as much as 300 billion rubles ($9.6 billion) in mineral
extraction taxes, he said.  The  Finance Ministry  sold 19.2 billion rubles ($615
million) of bonds due April 2017 at an average yield of 7.53
percent today, the Finance Ministry said on its website. The
ministry offered 20 billion rubles of the notes at guidance of
7.5 percent to 7.55 percent, according to an announcement on its
website yesterday. Demand at the high end of the guidance was 27
billion rubles, according to today’s statement.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8213 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.4810 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose four basis points to 214,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
four basis points to 7.569 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
