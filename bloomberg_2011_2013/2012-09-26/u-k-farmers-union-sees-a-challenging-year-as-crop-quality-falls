U.K. farmers face “a challenging
year ahead” as the declining quality of this year’s harvest
means merchants and processors may dock payments made for grain,
the National Farmers Union said.  Better transparency is needed on how penalties are applied
for quality issues including grain weights, the Stoneleigh,
England-based group said today in an e-mailed  statement . Average
wheat grain weights, which can affect flour extraction, may be
the lowest in  Great Britain  since 1977, after the wettest summer
weather in a century, the U.K. Agriculture and Horticulture
Development Board said Sept. 21.  “Farmers generally recognize the facts about this year’s
harvest and that it will need to be managed,” Andrew Watts,
combinable crops chairman for the NFU, said in the statement.
“We are challenging merchants and processors to help by being
much more transparent about the way in which claims are
calculated. A difficult season will demonstrate where a farmer’s
interests are best served within the trade.”  Feed wheat prices have climbed 35 percent on NYSE Liffe in
 London  this year as excess rain in the U.K. was compounded by
drought in the U.S. and  Russia . The U.K. is Europe’s third-
largest wheat producer, after  France  and Germany.  To contact the reporter for this story:
