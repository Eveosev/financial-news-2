Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
has an approval rating of 79 percent after almost three months
in office, according to a poll by the Egyptian Center for Public
Opinion Research.  The poll found that 13 percent of people surveyed said they
were dissatisfied with Mursiâ€™s performance, while 65 percent
said they would vote for him if snap elections were held, the
Cairo-based group said on its website. The study interviewed
1,665 people and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points,
it said.  The survey found that security was the area where the
public showed the most satisfaction, with 75 percent of
respondents saying there has been an improvement, compared with
58 percent in a previous study earlier this month by the same
group. Easing traffic congestion ranked second, followed by the
cleaning of rubbish and the availability of bread and fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
