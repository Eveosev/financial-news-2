German utility  RWE AG (RWE)  and
Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske, the Bosnian Serb state-owned
power company, will develop four hydro plants on the Drina river
by 2020, expanding Elektroprivreda’s output by 15 percent.  The plants, with 220 megawatt combined capacity and
expected production of 800 gigawatt hours a year, may cost about
460 million euros ($592 million) to build and will be developed
by a joint venture 60 percent-owned by a unit of Essen-based RWE
and 40 percent by Banja Luka-based Elektroprivreda, said
Vladislav Vladicic,  ERS ’s executive director for investments and
development, in a phone interview.  “Financing will be proportionate to ownership” in the
joint venture. It will be from own assets and from bank loans,’’
Vladicic said before the signing of an agreement with RWE today
in Banja Luka, the capital of Republika Srpska, the Serb half of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Construction of two larger plants, Buk Bijela and Foca, is
to begin in September 2014 and March 2015 respectively, followed
by the Paunci and Sutjeska plants, and may take six years to
complete, Vladicic said.  “Hydropower is a key part of our strategy to expand the
use of renewables,” said Hans Bünting, the head of RWE Innogy,
said in an e-mailed statement after the utilities signed the
partnership agreement. “It gives us a common interest with
south-eastern  Europe , where vast potential exists for hydropower
projects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
