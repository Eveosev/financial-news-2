South Africa  exported yellow corn
to  South Korea  for the first time this marketing season as the
price of local corn fell below that of competitors.  The nation,  Africa ’s biggest producer of the grain,
exported 12,152 metric tons of the yellow variety in the week
ended Sept. 21, according to the Pretoria-based  South African
Grain Information website . South Africa’s corn marketing season
begins on May 1.  “Our prices are now low enough compared to global prices,
we are a lot more competitive,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG
(Pty) Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg today.  Yellow corn for December delivery traded at 2,247 rand a
ton ($273) in Johannesburg compared with about $289 a ton for
delivery in the same month in  Chicago . The U.S. is the world’s
biggest corn producer.  So far this season South Africa has exported 72,095 tons of
yellow corn, with South Korea the only destination for shipments
outside Africa.  Last season the country exported 711,816 tons of yellow
corn including 301,979 tons to South Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
