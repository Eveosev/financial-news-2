Triton Advisers Ltd., a private-
equity firm that invests in Northern Europe, is seeking 2.4
billion euros ($3.1 billion) for its next fund that will focus
on middle-market businesses in German-speaking and Nordic
countries.  Triton Fund IV LP will invest in businesses with 50 million
to 500 million euros in enterprise value, according to a
private-placement memorandum, a copy of which was obtained by
 Bloomberg News . The firm targets industrial, business services
and consumer companies.  The amount sought by Fund IV is similar to the 2.38 billion
euros the prior fund raised in 2009. Fund III has exited three
of its 13 investments, with realized deals returning 2.7 times
invested capital, according to the memo. The firm’s second fund,
from 2006, has produced a 20 percent net internal rate of
return.  Mark Weston, who is responsible for  investor relations  at
Triton, didn’t return a call seeking comment.  The new fund will charge a 2 percent management fee on
capital of as much as 1.5 billion euros and 1.5 percent after
that, according to the marketing document.  Triton has invested 2.9 billion euros in 40 investments
since 1999. Of these, 20 investments have been fully or
partially realized, producing 3.3 billion euros of value on 856
million euros of equity invested, according to the memorandum.  Triton was founded in  Jersey ,  Channel Islands , in 1997,
according to its website. The firm has offices in London,
Frankfurt, Stockholm, Luxembourg and Shanghai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
