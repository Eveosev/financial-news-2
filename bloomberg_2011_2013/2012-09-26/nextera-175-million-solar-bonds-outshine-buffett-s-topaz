NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  bonds for a
pair of Canadian solar projects were rated higher than debt from
 Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., the largest
issuance for a U.S. renewable-energy project without a federal
guarantee.  DBRS awarded a BBB rating to NextEra’s C$171.8 million
($175 million) bonds for the Sombra and Moore solar farms in St.
Clair, Ontario, two levels above junk, in a Sept. 21 report.
Debt for Buffett’s Topaz Solar Farm in California received a
BBB- rating from  Fitch Ratings , its lowest investment grade.  “The key differentiator that allowed St. Clair to obtain a
higher rating is the absence of construction risk,” Joseph Salvatore, a New York-based analyst for Bloomberg New Energy
Finance, said in an interview yesterday. “The St. Clair
projects went online in June, while Topaz isn’t scheduled to
reach commercial operation until 2015.”  NextEra’s two 20-megawatt facilities, known collectively as
St. Clair Holding Inc., supply electricity under a 20-year
contract to the Ontario Power Authority. Juno Beach, Florida-
based NextEra is the top U.S. operator of wind farms and solar
projects.  NextEra financed the C$194.8 million projects with a bridge
loan and equity, according to DBRS, a Toronto-based ratings
company, and plans to refinance them with proceeds from the
notes.  MidAmerican issued $850 million in debt in February for its
$2.4 billion Topaz Solar Farm in California. Both projects were
developed by Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest
U.S. solar manufacturer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
