SIC Insurance Company Ltd. (SIC) , the
biggest insurer in  Ghana , gained the most in three years as
investors speculate profit will increase in the nine months
ending this month.  The stock rose 9.7 percent to 34 pesewas at the close in
the capital, Accra, the biggest increase since September 2009.  “Investors are taking advantage of the lower price before
the release of nine-month results, which will spark demand for
the shares,” Xorlali Torsu, a stock trader at Databank
Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone today. “We
forecast the company’s profit after tax to increase 15 percent
year-on-year.”  SIC began to use business intermediaries to help grow
premiums, said Torsu. The method, which sells insurance products
directly to consumers, is “more aggressive than what is being
done by competitors.”  SIC’s net income grew 15 percent in the first half through
June 30 to 7.8 million cedis ($4.1 million). Net premiums
increased to 37 million cedis from 32.6 million cedis a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
