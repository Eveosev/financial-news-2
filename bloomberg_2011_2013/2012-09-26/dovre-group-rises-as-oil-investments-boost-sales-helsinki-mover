Dovre Group Oyj (DOV1V) , a Finnish provider
of software and consulting to energy companies, climbed the most
in more than two years as surging oil and gas investments in
Norway contributed to a better forecast.  Dovre gained as much as 11 percent, the most since May
2010. Shares in the Espoo, Finland-based company rose 6.4
percent to 50 cents at 6:08 p.m. in Helsinki trading.  “The energy sector has seen a great amount of investments
around the world lately,” Chief Executive Officer Janne Mielck,
a former vice president at refiner  Neste Oil Oyj (NES1V) ’s oil products
and renewables unit, said by phone today. “Central markets for
us are Norway and  Canada , any development there has the biggest
absolute impact on our business.”  Investments in the oil and gas industry in  Norway  are
forecast to rise to a record 204 billion kroner ($35 billion) in
2013, compared with a June estimate of 194 billion kroner, the
nation’s statistics office said on Sept. 6, citing its quarterly
survey of producers and explorers. Investments next year will
rise 10 percent from 185 billion kroner this year, after gaining
27 percent this year.  Dovre said today net sales and comparable operating result
will grow over 20 percent this year from 2011, compared with an
earlier estimate of over 15 percent sales growth. Dovre Group
had annual sales of 72.5 million euros last year. It will
publish third-quarter earnings on Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
