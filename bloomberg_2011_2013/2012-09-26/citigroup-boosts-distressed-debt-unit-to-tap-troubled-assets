Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, boosted the size of its European
distressed-debt sourcing unit as crisis-hit lenders seek to cut
their balance sheets.  Citigroup now has six people working on finding troubled
assets from other banks in  Europe , including two people
dedicated exclusively to this task, according to Simon Boughey,
a London-based spokesman for the bank. The unit had one person a
month ago, he said.  “The team will focus on aiding our banking clients as they
continue the process of deleveraging,” said Conor Davis, head
of credit sales for Europe.  European banks may need to reduce their balance sheets by
as much as $3.8 trillion through asset sales and reduced lending
to meet tougher capital requirements, the Washington-based
 International Monetary Fund  said in a report in April. Disposals
will include about 500 billion euros ($644 billion) of loan
portfolios in the next five to 10 years, Moody’s Investors
Service said on Aug. 8.  Funds investing in distressed assets earned a 5.2 percent
return this year, after losing 6.2 percent in 2011, according to
an index compiled by by hedge fund advisory firm Hennessee Group
LLC.  Citigroup’s shares fell 70 cents to $32.16 at 10:55 a.m. in
 New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
