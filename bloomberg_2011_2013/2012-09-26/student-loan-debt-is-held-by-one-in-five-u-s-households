Almost a fifth of U.S. households
had student-loan debt in 2010, more than twice the level of
1989, with the burden falling disproportionately on the youngest
and poorest.  The average outstanding debt was $26,682 in households with
 student loans , according to a report released today by the  Pew
Research Center , a nonprofit organization in  Washington .  The total U.S. debt from educational loans was $914 billion
in the second quarter, according to the  Federal Reserve Bank of
New York . Student borrowing has soared with climbing college
tuitions and as the federal government has raised borrowing
limits to $31,000 from $7,500 in the 1960s. The government has
tried to ease the burden of debt by creating an income-based
repayment program.  While households in the upper fifth of income held 31
percent of student debt, the least affluent owed a greater share
compared with their income, according to the Pew report. Among
the poorest fifth, outstanding student debt accounted for 24
percent of annual  household income , compared with 2 percent for
the wealthiest 10 percent.  A record 40 percent of households headed by someone younger
than 35 had student debt in 2010, compared with 17 percent in
1989.  Student loan debt was 5 percent of all debt held by U.S.
households in 2010, up from 3 percent in 2007, even as total
household indebtedness fell to $100,720 from $105,297 over the
same period, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
