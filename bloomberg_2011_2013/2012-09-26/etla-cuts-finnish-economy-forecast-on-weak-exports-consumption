Finland’s economy will expand 0.5
percent this year and 1 percent in 2013, Helsinki-based ETLA
research institute forecast.  “Global economic recovery has been delayed,” the
institute said in a statement. “An upswing is not expected
until mid-2013 at the earliest.”  The group in March predicted 0.9 percent growth for 2012
and 2.6 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
