Treasury 10-year notes rose for an
eighth day, the longest run of gains since December 2008, as
investors sought safety with Spanish debt yields climbing toward
levels that prompted other European nations to seek bailouts.  Yields on the benchmark U.S. securities dropped to a two-
week low as gauges of inflation expectations receded from the
highs reached after the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round
of debt purchases, or quantitative easing. Investor demand for a
haven pushed the yields on the $35 billion in U.S. five-year
notes slated to be sold today close to record auction lows.  “It’s the chaos in  Europe ,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “There’s still concern
about the global economy. Those things together may have helped
to bid Treasuries up. It’s the crisis that won’t go away.”  The 10-year  yield  dropped three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.64 percent at 12:35 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in August 2022 rose 1/4, or $2.50 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 7/8. The yield reached below its 100- and 50-day
moving averages of 1.64 percent and touched 1.62 percent, the
lowest level since Sept. 7. It rose to 1.89 percent on Sept. 14,
the highest since May.  The eight-day advance in prices is the longest since the
period ended Dec. 4, 2008, when the economy was deteriorating as
the financial crisis worsened. The gains since last week pared
the benchmark note’s loss for September to 0.6 percent.  Spain, Italy  Spanish 10-year  bonds  slumped, with yields rising the most
this month, after Catalan President Artur Mas called early
elections yesterday. His bid for greater autonomy came a week
after President  Mariano Rajoy  rejected his demand for increased
control of the region’s revenue.  The drop in  Spain ’s 10-year bond sent the yield up as much
as 30 basis points to 6.04 percent. It reached a five-month low
of 5.6 percent on Sept. 10.  Italy ’s 10-year yield rose 10 basis
points to 5.2 percent, moving higher for the fifth straight day.
The yield on  Portugal ’s 10-year debt climbed 14 basis points to
8.88 percent, the highest since it closed on Sept. 5 at 9.1
percent.  German and British government securities rose as investors
sought safety, sending yields lower. The yield on 10-year German
bunds dropped 13 basis points to 1.46 percent, and 10-year U.K.
gilt yields decreased 13 basis points to 1.69 percent.  More Expensive  U.S.  government securities  were the most expensive in three
weeks. The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists
at the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation, was negative 0.94 percent, the most costly since
Sept. 3. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value. The average
this year is negative 0.74 percent.  Gauges of inflation expectations are subsiding following an
initial surge triggered by the Fed announcement of more debt
purchases on Sept. 13.  The five-year, five-year forward  break-even rate , a measure
of inflation expectations the Fed uses to help guide monetary
policy, was 2.74. It has fallen from 2.88 on Sept. 14, which was
the most in 13 months.  “The sell-off in mid-September was an overreaction to
QE3,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “This is an overreaction to
the overreaction.”  Treasury Auction  The five-year notes being sold at 1 p.m. New York time
today yielded 0.66 percent in pre-auction trading, versus 0.708
percent at the previous sale of the securities on Aug. 29. The
record low auction bid was 0.584 percent on July 27.  Investors  bid  for 2.92 times the amount offered last month,
up from 2.71 times on July 25. The Treasury sold $35 billion of
two-year notes yesterday and plans to auction $29 billion of
seven-year securities tomorrow. The U.S. is selling $99 billion
in notes this week.  “All the uncertainty we’re facing means we’re not likely
to be too vulnerable here,” Coard of Williams Capital said.
“It will be an OK auction.”  Treasuries returned 0.4 percent since the end of June,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German debt
gained 0.5 percent, and Japanese  government bonds  rose 0.4
percent, the data show.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said after its September
meeting the central bank will buy mortgage-backed securities at
a pace of $40 billion per month, its third round of quantitative
easing, until the labor market improves. Policy makers have
turned to unconventional tools to tackle unemployment that has
held above 8 percent since February 2009.  Mortgage Securities  A measure of relative yields on mortgage securities that
guide U.S. home-loan rates fell to a record amid speculation the
Fed will find a shortage of the bonds as it expands purchases. A
Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed mortgage
bonds trading closest to face value fell one basis point today
to 55 basis points higher than an average of five- and 10-year
Treasury rates.  “To get yields, investors are forced to take on credit
risk,”  said Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $10 billion
as co-head of government and mortgage-backed securities at
Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. “The unlimited QE has caused
yields to fall and mortgages to outperform. Investors are just
desperate for yields.”  The Fed is also swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings with those due in six to 30 years to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs. The central bank bought $4.7
billion of debt today maturing from September 2018 to May 2020
as part of the program, according to the Fed Bank of  New York ’s
 website .  To contact the reporters on this story:
