The Czech government approved the
2013 budget draft, endorsing a  deficit -reduction plan that
assumes tax increases opposed by some lawmakers in Premier Petr
Necas’s party.  The draft sets the ceiling for the public-finance deficit
at 2.9 percent of  economic output , compared with 3.2 percent
expected this year, Premier Petr Necas told reporters in Prague
today.  The government suffered a loss in the lower house of
parliament on Sept. 5 when it failed to secure enough votes to
push through a bill to raise taxes. Six lawmakers from Necas’s
 Civic Democratic Party  joined the opposition and rejected the
set of measures proposed to reduce the deficit, saying they are
against a plan to boost revenue with higher taxes.  The Cabinet submitted the legislation to Parliament again,
saying it is needed to cut the fiscal shortfall to less than the
European Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product
next year and linked approval of the bill to a vote of
confidence.  Necas, who lost his parliamentary majority in April amid
personnel and budget rows, credits previous austerity measures
with helping reduce borrowing costs and says the new package,
which includes higher sales taxes and a new levy on the highest
incomes, will maintain investor confidence.  The two-year-old Cabinet has cut investment, raised the
sales tax and curbed spending on public wages. The budget
shortfall narrowed to 3.1 percent of GDP last year, from 4.8
percent in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
