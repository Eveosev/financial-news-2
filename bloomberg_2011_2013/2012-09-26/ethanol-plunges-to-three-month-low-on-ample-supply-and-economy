Ethanol fell to a three-month low
on mounting concern that a global economic slowdown will reduce
demand for the biofuel.  Futures moved lower with crude oil and corn as protests in
Spain and  Greece  erupted over the region’s austerity measures.
Separately, the Energy Department said total U.S. fuel use
decreased 1.1 percent in the four weeks ended Sept. 21.  “All the markets seem to be down,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s not too much
positive news. We’re down hard on crude and the grains.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery fell 3.6 cents, or
1.6 percent, to $2.227 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest settlement since June 28. Futures have gained 1.1
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast dropped 4
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.34 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive decreased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.295, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1 cent, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.235 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel gained 1 cent, or
0.4 percent, to $2.30.  Prices also plunged after the Energy Department reported
 stockpiles  of the fuel were 19.3 million barrels last week, up
11 percent from a year earlier. Imports averaged 72,000 barrels
a day, 24 percent higher than a week earlier, up from 17,000 a
year ago and the third-highest level of 2012.  Crude, Gasoline  Crude for November delivery fell $1.39, or 1.5 percent, to
$89.98 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Aug. 2.  Gasoline for October delivery surged 11.4 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $3.0811 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Gasoline stretched its  premium  to ethanol to 85.41 cents
from 70.41 yesterday, the highest since May 29, spurred by
speculation that supplies of the motor fuel on the East Coast
may tighten after an explosion at Irving Oil Corp.’s New
Brunswick refinery.  Corn for December delivery dropped 19 cents, or 2.6
percent, to settle at $7.2475 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
