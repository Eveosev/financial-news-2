7 Days Group Holdings Ltd. (SVN)  jumped
to a four-month high in U.S. trading after the second-biggest
budget hotel owner in China said it received a buyout proposal
to take the company private.  The company’s American depositary receipts surged 13
percent in its fourth day of gains to $11.95 in New York, the
highest level since May 7. Each ADR represents three ordinary
shares.  The board of Guangzhou-based 7 Days received the “non-
binding” proposal from a group of private-equity firms led by
the  Carlyle Group (CG)  LP and  Sequoia Capital , and existing
shareholders including the company’s co-chairmen Boquan He and
Nanyan Zheng, it said in a statement today. The group plans to
purchase all outstanding shares with cash at $4.23 each, or
$12.7 per ADR.  The valuations of Chinese budget hotel operators as a group
are attractive, Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset
Management Inc., wrote in an e-mail from Lisle,  Illinois . “They
generate strong return per hotel investment and there remains
plenty of growth.”  The company’s board is expected to form a special committee
to consider the proposal with the assistance of a financial
adviser and legal counsel, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
