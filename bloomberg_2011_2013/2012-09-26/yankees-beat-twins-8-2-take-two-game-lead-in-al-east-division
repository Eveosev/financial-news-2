The  New York Yankees  beat the
Minnesota Twins 8-2 to retain their advantage atop the American
League East over the  Baltimore Orioles , who hit seven home runs
in a 12-2 rout of the Toronto Blue Jays.  The Yankees (90-65) remain 1 1/2 games ahead of the Orioles
(89-67), who occupy the top spot in the AL wild-card race. The
second wild-card spot is held by the Oakland Athletics (88-67),
who last night defeated the Texas Rangers 9-3. The Major League
Baseball regular season ends Oct. 3.  New York starter CC Sabathia allowed two runs on six hits
over eight innings for his 14th victory of the season. He threw
118 pitches and struck out 10, his second consecutive game with
double-digit strikeouts.  “This is what he can do, he can string a bunch of good
ones together,” Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said. “And if
there’s a time, now’s the time.”  After the Twins took a 1-0 lead, the Yankees scored eight
straight runs, including a six-run third inning that featured a
two-run double from Robinson Cano and a two-run triple by  Curtis Granderson  at Target Field in Minneapolis. New York has won nine
of its past 11 games.  Yankees shortstop  Derek Jeter  went 0-for-4, ending a 19-
game hitting streak.  Seven Homers  At Camden Yards, Chris Davis had two home runs and drove in
a career-high five runs, while Manny Machado added two homers
for the Orioles.  Nate McLouth,  Jim Thome  and  Mark Reynolds  added home runs
as the seven homers tied a franchise record.  “We can’t count on teams to lose right now,” Davis said
in a televised interview. “We don’t want to settle for the wild
card. We want to win the division.”  In the AL Central, the Detroit Tigers (83-72) defeated the
Kansas City Royals 5-4 to take a one-game lead over the Chicago
White Sox, who fell out of first place by losing 6-4 to the
Cleveland Indians. The Rangers (91-64) are three games ahead of
the Athletics in the AL West.  In the National League, the Washington Nationals (94-61)
defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 8-4 to stay four games ahead
of the Atlanta Braves in the East. The Braves (90-65), who lead
in the race for the NL’s two wild cards, shut out the Miami
Marlins 3-0. The St. Louis Cardinals (84-72), who lost to the
Houston Astros 2-0, are in position for the second wild-card
spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
