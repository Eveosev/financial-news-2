Daniel Ivascyn, who runs the $1.25
billion closed-end  Pimco Dynamic Income Fund (PDI) , added 21,400
shares of the fund valued at about $591,709.  Ivascyn, who also manages the $12.8 billion  Pimco Income
Fund (PIMIX)  at  Newport Beach , California-based Pacific Investment
Management Co., bought 100 shares at $27.64 and 21,300 shares at
$27.65, according to a regulatory filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. He now owns 171,400 shares,
and would rank as the third-biggest owner after Bank of America
Corp. and RiverNorth Capital Management, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Pimco Dynamic Income Fund opened in May and offers
distributions of 7.6 percent. The fund’s  return  to investors,
including dividends, is 13.8 percent since inception through
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Closed-end
funds sell a fixed amount of shares to raise money for
investments and trade on an exchange like stocks.  Ivascyn joined Pimco in 1998 and was part of the team that
helped the firm weather the U.S. housing meltdown by guiding it
largely out of so-called non-agency mortgage-backed securities,
or those without an explicit or implicit guarantee from the U.S.
government, before the crisis. His Income Fund has returned 17.5
percent this year, compared with 9.1 percent for Pimco’s
flagship Total Return Fund run by  Bill Gross .  Michael Reid, a spokesman for Pimco, declined to comment on
the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
