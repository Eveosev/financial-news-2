Tropical Storm Nadine, which formed
more than two weeks ago, was moving south-southwest in the
Atlantic, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Miriam was losing strength in the Pacific.  Nadine, the 14th named storm of the Atlantic season which
runs through to November, was about 530 miles (830 kilometers)
south-southwest of the Azores, with winds of 45 miles per hour
as it moved at 5 mph, the Miami-based center said in an  advisory 
issued at 5 a.m. Atlantic Standard Time.  Tropical Storm Miriam was about 430 miles west-southwest of
the southern tip of  Baja California , a peninsula in northwest
 Mexico , with winds of 70 mph, the NHC said in a separate
 advisory . The system is set to weaken in the next two days.  Further south, the center was monitoring a system a few
hundred miles southwest of  Acapulco , Mexico, which has a 20
percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two
days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
