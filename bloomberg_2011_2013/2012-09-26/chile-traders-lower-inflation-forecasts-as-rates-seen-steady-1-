Chilean traders and investors
reduced their inflation estimates today while forecasting the
 key interest rate  would remain unchanged for at least two years.  Traders and investors forecast the benchmark  interest rate 
will remain on hold at 5 percent for at least 24 months,
matching estimates they made on Sept. 12, according to the bi-
weekly survey published on the central bank website today.
Traders lowered their September inflation estimate to 0.55
percent today from 0.6 percent in the previous poll.  Policy makers this month reduced their inflation forecast
for the year and raised their outlook for gross domestic product
after the economy expanded faster than forecast in the second
quarter. As a result,  Chile ’s central bank board is unlikely to
follow its peers in  Brazil  in cutting rates to stimulate growth,
economist Alejandro Fernandez wrote Sept. 24.  “The most likely scenario continues to be a hold at the
current 5 percent until the end of the year, and there’s a high
probability it will remain at that level until the end of the
first quarter of 2013,” Fernandez, an economist at Santiago-
based research company Gemines Consultores, wrote in a report e-
mailed to customers.  The peso depreciated 0.4 percent at 8:37 a.m. Santiago time
to 471.95 per  U.S. dollar . Chile’s currency will trade at 474
per dollar in seven days, according to the median estimate of
traders and investors in today’s survey.  Growth Forecast  Chile’s central bank in its quarterly monetary policy
report, published Sept. 5, raised its 2012 GDP growth forecast
to a range of 4.75 percent to 5.25 percent from its previous
estimate of 4 percent to 5 percent. GDP increased 5.5 percent in
the second quarter from last year, its fastest expansion in a
year.  Policy makers, who target 3 percent annual inflation plus
or minus one percentage point over two years, also reduced their
2012 inflation estimate to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent. Traders
and investors in today’s survey forecast  inflation  of 2.9
percent in 12 months, compared with their 3 percent estimate two
weeks ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
