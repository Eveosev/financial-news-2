WestLB AG, the German lender that
ceased operations in June, won dismissal of a lawsuit in  New
York  state court seeking $492 million in damages for alleged
investment losses, according to court documents.  WestLB, based in Dusseldorf, was sued by Bank Hapoalim BM,
Israel’s second-biggest bank by assets, Israel-based  Mizrahi
Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) , Bahrain-based Arab Banking Corp. and Dublin-
based Anglo Irish Bank Corp. in November 2009. The banks alleged
they lost their entire investment in two WestLB-managed
structured investment vehicles and accused the German lender of
claims including fraud and negligence.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Shirley Werner Kornreich said in her dismissal ruling that the plaintiffs are
“highly sophisticated business entities” that had access to
information that they claim the defendants used to misrepresent
the portfolio.  The lawsuit “fails to support any inference that
plaintiffs were unaware of the same information or unable to
apprise themselves of it,” Kornreich said in her Sept. 24
ruling. “It establishes the opposite.”  WestLB ceased operations on June 29 as part of European
Union conditions tied to a 17 billion euro ($21.9 billion)
package of aid to bail out the bank following the 2008 financial
crisis.  The case is  Bank Hapoalim BM (POLI)  v. WestLB AG, 603458/2009, New
York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
