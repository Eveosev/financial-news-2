TNK-BP gained the most in more than
a week as investors speculated  BP Plc (BP/) ’s billionaire partners in
 Russia ’s third-largest oil producer will enter a bidding war
against OAO Rosneft for the U.K. explorer’s entire stake.  TNK-BP jumped 2 percent to 84.3 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the biggest advance since Sept. 14. Rosneft, the
country’s biggest oil producer, dropped 2.3 percent to 204.18
rubles. BP last traded 1.8 percent lower at 438.05 pence in
 London . Russia’s Micex Index slumped 2.4 percent.  AAR, the group representing the billionaires, will make a
binding cash offer to acquire the U.K. oil producer’s entire 50
percent of the TNK-BP venture rather than the half of BP’s
holding it proposed to acquire in July, according to a person
with knowledge of the plans, who declined to be identified
before the bid is submitted. Rosneft, headed by President
 Vladimir Putin ’s former deputy for energy,  Igor Sechin , is
seeking as much as $15 billion in loans to buy BP out of the
50-50 venture, two people said Sept. 19.  “The market is hopeful of some kind of bidding war between
Rosneft and AAR,” Julian Rimmer, a trader at CF Global Trading,
said by e-mail.  TNK-BP’s shares are also climbing on bets the company will
preserve its “high” dividends if AAR buys out the stake,
Sergey Vakhrameev, an analyst at IFC Metropol in Moscow, said by
phone.  The shareholders of TNK-BP approved a full-year dividend of
9.96 rubles (32 cents) per common and preferred share for 2011.
That’s in addition to the 3.41 rubles a share  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) 
paid out for the first half of 2011, the Moscow-based company
said in a June 28 statement. State-run Rosneft will pay 7.53
rubles a share in 2011 dividends, the company said on Sept. 18
in a regulatory filing.  “Although Rosneft as a state-owned company has more money
to win the bidding, some investors are hopeful that if AAR wins,
they will keep the high dividends,” Vakhrameev said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
