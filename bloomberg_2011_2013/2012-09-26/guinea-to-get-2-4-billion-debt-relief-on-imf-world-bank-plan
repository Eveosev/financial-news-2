Guinea  has reached the so-called
completion point of the  International Monetary Fund  and  World
Bank ’s Heavily Indebted Poor Countries’ Initiative, paving the
way for $2.4 billion in debt relief, according to the
government.  The West African nation’s debt will be reduced by about two
thirds, it said in an e-mailed statement distributed by London-
based communications company Hillingdon Cresswell.  Guinea, the world’s biggest bauxite exporter, returned to a
civilian-led administration following the November 2010 election
of  Alpha Conde , ending two years of military rule that saw the
country break relations with the international lenders. Growth
is expected to reach 4.7 percent this year from 3.6 percent in
2010, according to the IMF’s World Economic Outlook April
report.  The government “now intends to follow through with
responsible budget management, good governance and further
reforms to ensure long term and sustainable growth,” according
to the statement.  In August, the IMF said Guinea would get about $28 million
in the second disbursement of an extended credit facility,
following a $194.5 million tranche in February. The IMF said it
expects Guinea to reach the completion point under the HIPC
program this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
