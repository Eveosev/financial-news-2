South Korea ’s won weakened and
 government bonds  advanced after Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  expressed doubts about
the effects of the U.S. central bank’s stimulus measures.  Plosser said yesterday that the new bond-buying program
announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost growth or
hiring and may jeopardize the monetary authority’s credibility.
The  Kospi index  of shares fell for a second day and government
debt rose. An official report due Sept. 28 will show South
Korea’s industrial  output  declined for a third month in August,
while  exports , scheduled Oct. 1, are forecast to drop 6 percent
this month, according to separate Bloomberg surveys.  “With shares falling, and skepticism toward the effects of
another round of quantitative easing spreading, the won is
facing downward pressure,” said Kim Dong Young, a Seoul-based
currency dealer for the Industrial Bank of  Korea . The won’s
losses will be limited as exporters are likely to sell dollars
ahead of a public holiday on Oct. 1, he said.  The currency weakened 0.1 percent to 1,121 per dollar at
the close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, advanced five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 6.41 percent.  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 fell one basis point to 2.79 percent in Seoul, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap was
little changed at 2.88 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
