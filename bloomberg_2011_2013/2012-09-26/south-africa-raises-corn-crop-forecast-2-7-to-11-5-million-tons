South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, raised its forecast for output of the
grain by 2.7 percent as deliveries by producers were higher than
expected, according to the Crop Estimates Committee.  The country may reap 11.5 million metric tons for this
season, Marda Scheepers, a spokeswoman for the committee, said
by phone from  Pretoria  today. That’s above the 11.39 million-ton
median estimate of five traders in a Bloomberg News survey and
more than the committee’s Aug. 28 forecast of 11.2 million tons.
This is the final estimate for the season. South  Africa  produced
10.4 million tons of corn last year.  White corn is one of South Africa’s staple foods while the
yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed . The Free State
province produces 40 percent of the nation’s corn, while
Mpumalanga grows 21 percent, according to the agriculture
department.  “The increase is because physical deliveries to silos in
the season were better than anticipated,” she said. “We had a
mid-season drought, but deliveries were higher in the end.”  The forecast includes 6.51 million tons of white corn and
4.99 million tons of the yellow variety, she said.  South Africa decreased its forecast for wheat output this
season by 0.1 percent as the area planted in the Free State
province was smaller than thought, Scheepers said.  Farmers are expected to reap 1.762 million tons of wheat in
the season compared with an estimate of 1.764 million tons last
month. The median estimate of five analysts was unchanged from
the previous forecast.  South Africa is a net importer of wheat and is sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest producer of the grain after  Ethiopia . The
nation is the region’s biggest importer after Nigeria and  Sudan ,
according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  White corn for December delivery,the most active contract,
fell 3.3 percent to 2,237 rand ($272) a ton by the close in
Johannesburg. Yellow corn for delivery in the same month dropped
2.6 percent to 2,247 rand.  South African wheat prices have fallen 19 percent from a
record 4,304 rand a ton in March 2008 to 3,472 rand a ton today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
