Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell to
an almost three-week low on speculation the prospect of an
economic slowdown prompted investors to favor the relative
safety of the dollar.  Government bonds  declined.  The rupiah touched the weakest level since May after
overseas funds pulled 680 billion rupiah ($71 million) from
local sovereign-debt holdings on Sept. 24, finance ministry data
show. Investors bid for 2.4 times the amount offered at a
government bond auction yesterday, compared with 2.8 times at
the previous sale on Sept. 11. Indonesia’s economic growth will
slow to 6 percent this year from 6.5 percent in 2011, according
to an International Monetary Fund report released yesterday.  “The spot price tends to follow the forwards market, which
is quite bearish on the rupiah,” said Artanavaro Gasali, the
head of global markets at PT Bank ICBC Indonesia in Jakarta.
“Domestic demand for dollars is still the major factor, both
from investors seeking a safe haven and to fulfill corporate
needs. Demand for bonds has also receded.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards for the rupiah
weakened 0.5 percent to 10,145 per dollar as of 4:03 p.m. in
Jakarta, the lowest level since Sept. 6, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The contracts, which are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date, traded at a 5.8 percent
discount to the spot rate. Non-deliverable forwards are settled
in dollars.  The IMF estimated that the rupiah is “moderately
undervalued” by zero to 10 percent, the Washington-based lender
said in its report yesterday.  Fifth Quarterly Drop  The rupiah was little changed at 9,585 per dollar, after
reaching 9,628 earlier, the lowest level since May 31, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency has
lost 1.6 percent since June 29, poised for its fifth quarterly
decline in a row.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was steady at 5
percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.02
percent, the highest level since Sept. 6, closing prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
