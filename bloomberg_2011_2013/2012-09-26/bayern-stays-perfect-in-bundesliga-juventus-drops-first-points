Bayern Munich  beat Vfl Wolfsburg
3-0 to maintain its perfect start to the German league soccer
season. Juventus lost its 100 percent record in Italy by drawing
0-0 at Fiorentina.  Bastian Schweinsteiger opened the scoring and Mario
Mandzukic added two goals against his former club last night as
Bayern moved to 15 points atop the standings. Eintracht
Frankfurt is two points back after its winning start ended with
a 3-3 draw against  Borussia Dortmund .  Bayern, seeking its first league championship since 2010,
has opened the season by scoring 17 goals and allowing two in
five straight victories, a record the club said is its best
start to a Bundesliga campaign.  “You can see we’re all enjoying it,” Mandzukic said on
Bayern’s website. “Every one of us is fighting for the others
out on the field, and that’s how we want to carry on.”  In Florence, defending Serie A champion Juventus failed to
win for the first time this season though extended its unbeaten
run to 44 matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
