Gold fell to a two-week low as the
dollar rose amid concern that the crisis in  Spain  is worsening,
crimping demand for the metal as an alternative investment.  The  dollar  gained for the third straight day against a
basket of six currencies as clashes in  Madrid  preceded a general
strike in  Athens  to protest austerity measures at the center of
Europe’s financial crisis. The Bank of Spain said the economy
kept falling at a “significant pace” in the third quarter.
Gold has climbed 9.3 percent this quarter, partly on speculation
that Europe’s leaders would be able to stem the region’s fiscal
woes.  “Global anxieties surrounding Europe are flaring up, and
we are seeing a flight to cash,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior
market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview. “People are in a risk-off mode
today.”  Gold futures for December delivery retreated 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,753.60 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after earlier dropping to $1,738.30, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 13. The price is up 12 percent
this year.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
fell as much as 1.8 percent to 646.7, the lowest since Aug. 6.  Silver futures for December delivery fell less than 0.1
percent to $33.94 an ounce in New York. Prices are down for the
fourth consecutive session, the longest slump since May 16. The
metal is still up 23 percent this quarter, heading for biggest
gain since Dec. 31, 2010.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery rose 0.2 percent to $1,639.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery dropped 2.3 percent to
$625.85 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
