Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  jumped to a
three-month high after Polish billionaire Roman Karkosik’s
 Impexmetal SA (IPX)  raised its stake in  Poland ’s second-largest
construction company.  The  shares  surged as much as 9.6 percent to 0.91 zloty, the
strongest intraday level since June 21, and traded 6 percent up
at 0.88 zloty as of 11:54 a.m. in Warsaw. The stock has gained
67 percent this month, compared with a 4.3 percent advance in
the WIG20 Index.  Impexmetal, a Polish steel and metal company, increased its
holding of Polimex’s shares to 6.6 percent from 4.6 percent,
Polimex said in a regulatory filing today. The builder plans to
raise about 500 million zloty ($155 million) from share sales to
bondholders, current owners and strategic investor, it said on
Sept. 18.  “It shows that there might be some investors ready to even
take control of the company,” Bartlomiej Kubicki, a Vienna-
based analyst at Raiffeisen Centrobank AG, said in an e-mail
today. “It’s also possible Karkosik may take part in the new
share issue plan.”  VIS Construction Group of  Russia  is considering buying a
stake in Polimex, Parkiet reported on Aug. 22, citing a person
close to Polimex. VIS is ready to invest at least 100 million
euros ($129 million) on the Polish builder, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
