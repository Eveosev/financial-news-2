Osram, the lighting unit of  Siemens
AG (SIE) , said it’s optimistic that a spinoff planned next year will
work after abandoning plans for an initial public offering.  “Osram is well-prepared,” Klaus Patzak, the company’s
chief financial officer, said at a conference today in
Dusseldorf,  Germany . “After the spinoff, and the funds we will
then have available, this will soon show.”  Osram is grappling with what it calls a technological
revolution as light-emitting diodes replace conventional bulbs,
bringing in new rivals to companies from Siemens to Royal
Philips Electronics NV and  General Electric Co. (GE)  LEDs are
semiconductor-based, challenging the lighting market’s stable
bulb-replacement business.  Patzak said Osram has built its own departments for
corporate functions formerly handled by Siemens and can operate
at a lower cost than what it paid the parent company. A spinoff,
which will allocate Osram shares to Siemens investors, is less
dependent on a window of opportunity for a listing than an IPO,
he said.  The plan must first be approved by Siemens’ shareholders,
who are slated to consider it at the company’s annual meeting in
January. Siemens Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser has said the
parent company must supply Osram with sufficient capital to
qualify for a credit rating of between A- and BBB+.  To contact the reporter on this story:
