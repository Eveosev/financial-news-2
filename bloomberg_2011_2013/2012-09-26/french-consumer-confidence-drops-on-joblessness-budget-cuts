French  consumer confidence  fell for
a third month on concern that surging joblessness and President
 Francois Hollande ’s plans to slash the budget deficit will hurt
pocketbooks.  Household sentiment  dropped to 85 in September from 86 in
August, national statistics Insee said today in a release from
Paris. Economists had expected a reading of 86, according to the
median of 13 estimates gathered by Bloomberg News.  With companies such as  PSA Peugeot Citroen SA (UG)  and Air
France-KLM Group cutting thousands of staff and growth stalling
for the past three quarters, unemployment has jumped to a 13-
year high. That’s hurting confidence in a month when Hollande
has pledged 20 billion euros in tax increases and 10 billion
euros in spending cuts for the coming year.  “Consumers will be hit by the budget,” said Joost Beaumont, an economist at  ABN Amro  in Amsterdam. “The outlook
for spending is quite weak.”  Labor Minister Michel Sapin said that jobless claims have
already crossed 3 million. His ministry publishes its latest
estimate of claims at 6 p.m. Paris time today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
