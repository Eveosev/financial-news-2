The Urban Land Institute cut its
forecast for U.S. commercial real estate sales by 12 percent to
$748 billion through 2014 because projections for economic
growth are “down considerably” from six months ago.  Deals for properties such as office buildings, shopping
centers and warehouses probably will be $223 billion this year,
$250 billion next year and $275 billion in 2014, according to a
ULI survey released today of 39 economists and analysts from
real estate investment, advisory and research firms. In a March
report, sales were forecast at $250 billion this year, $290
billion next and $312 billion in 2014.  The forecast “is generally less optimistic regarding the
economy and the performance of commercial real estate,” the
Washington-based institute, which researches land-use and
development issues, said in its survey.  A recovery in commercial real estate nationwide is being
damped by sluggish economic expansion. The lowered forecast is
the result of slower-than-expected growth in the U.S. gross
domestic product, which is now projected to expand 2 percent
both this year and next year before rising to 2.9 percent growth
in 2014, the ULI said.  “These forecasts are down considerably from the spring
2012 forecast, which forecast the GDP would grow by 3 percent in
2013,” according to the semiannual “ULI Real Estate Consensus
Forecast.”  The forecast for new commercial mortgage-backed securities
also was cut. CMBS issuance probably will total $35 billion this
year, $45 billion next and $60 billion in 2014, the ULI said
today. That’s down from a March forecast of $40 billion this
year, $58 billion next and $75 billion in 2014.  REIT Returns  One projection boosted from the last survey was for the
performance of real estate investment trusts. Annual returns for
equity REITs are forecast to be 15 percent this year and 10
percent both next year and in 2014. That’s up from the previous
forecast of 10 percent this year, 9 percent next and 8.5 percent
in 2014, the institute said.  “If you’re a large institutional owner or REIT or a
leveraged individual, all of those holders are interested in
holding real estate,” Douglas Poutasse, a Boston-based
executive vice president at real estate adviser Bentall Kennedy
who participated in the survey, said on a conference call today.
“They are happy to hold real estate because of the very
attractive returns, especially compared to the  bond market .”  The ULI conducted its survey from Aug. 21 to Sept. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
