Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-energy
company, fell the most in 1 1/2 years in Frankfurt trading after
a canceled contract prompted a cut in its profit forecast.  Conergy slumped as much as 24 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since March 2011, after saying earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization will be negative this year.
The manufacturer previously predicted positive annual Ebitda.  The company, owned by creditors since 2011 after dwindling
demand and increased competition led to a restructuring, booked
a $21 million fee from terminating a supply agreement with  MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  The $600 million deal for polysilicon
wafers was supposed to run to 2018, according to Conergy, which
no longer produces solar cells and has no use for the wafers.  “Conergy’s earnings forecast for 2012, which assumed a
slightly positive Ebitda, is no longer viable,” the Hamburg-
based company said in a statement late yesterday. “The company
now expects a negative Ebitda for 2012 in the mid-double-digit
million euro range.”  Conergy fell as much as 11.3 euro cents, and was down 10
cents at 36.5 cents as of 10:17 a.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing the
company at 58.3 million euros.  The contract cancellation means Conergy can operate “more
flexibly” and reduce raw-material costs, Chief Operating
Officer Alexander Gorski said in a separate statement. The
termination “has no effect on our liquidity,” Antje Stephan, a
spokeswoman, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
