Energia Argentina SA, the country’s
state-run energy company, will next month issue a tender to buy
37 to 40 liquefied natural gas cargoes for 2013, World Gas
Intelligence said, citing an unidentified company official.  The company, known as Enarsa, will buy any extra shipments
on the  spot market , WGI reported, citing the official.  Enersa planned to import 80 tankers this year before
lowering its requirements by 30 percent in August, WGI said.
Mild winter weather and increased pipeline imports from  Bolivia 
have cut Argentinean demand for the chilled gas, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
