U.S. stocks  fell for a fifth day,
sending the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest retreat
since July, as concern grew Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  dropped 4.7 percent, helping to give
homebuilders their biggest decline since June, after new homes
sales missed estimates. Energy and technology companies dropped
the most among the benchmark gauge’s  10 industry groups  as oil
fell to a seven-week low and  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  tumbled 9.9
percent amid a disappointing forecast.  The  S&P 500  slid 0.6 percent to 1,433.32 in  New York . The
benchmark index is down 1.9 percent over five days. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  lost 44.04 points, or 0.3 percent, to
13,413.51 today. Almost 6.4 billion shares traded hands on U.S.
exchanges, 6.3 percent higher than the three-month average.  “We’re at a point where stimulus continues to be added and
yet we’re seeing no meaningful improvements in the global
economy,” Sean Lynch, the Omaha, Nebraska-based global
investment strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank, which
oversees $169 billion, said in a telephone interview. “When you
figure in some of the political risks along with Spain and
Greece leading headlines once again, it makes equity investors
want to pause right now.”  Stocks worldwide fell as Germany, the Netherlands and
Finland said late yesterday that Spain should bear the cost of
problems in their banks, with the European Stability Mechanism
assuming only a limited burden in recapitalizations. The Bank of
Spain said the economy kept falling at a “significant pace” in
the third quarter.  Highest Levels  U.S. equity indexes fell yesterday from their highest
levels in almost five years as Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said new bond buying
announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost growth or
hiring. The S&P 500 has erased all its gains since the  Federal
Open Market Committee  said Sept. 13 that it will undertake a
third round of quantitative easing by purchasing mortgage-backed
securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until labor
markets “improve substantially.”  Optimism that central banks around the world will take
steps to boost economic growth has sent the S&P 500 up 14
percent this year. The  European Central Bank  this month approved
unlimited bond-buying programs while the  Bank of Japan 
unexpectedly increased its asset-purchase target.  Investor Complacency  “The Fed cheerleading and stimulus has lulled investors
into a sense of complacency that the Fed can keep the economy
afloat and growing,” Eric Thorne, who helps oversee about $6
billion at Bryn Mawr Trust Co. in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, said
in a phone interview. “We’re afraid when reality sets in that
this economic recovery may take longer than expected, the market
could pull back quickly and meaningfully.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 5.2 percent so far in the third
quarter and pension funds may need to sell stocks this week to
rebalance their asset allocations, according to UBS AG
strategist Boris Rjavinski. U.S. pensions, which UBS estimates
hold about 55 percent of their $5 trillion in stocks, may pull
as much as $36 billion from equities and put as much as $19
billion into fixed income, Rjavinski wrote in a note to clients
dated Sept. 24. The largest outflows will be from stocks of
large U.S. companies, with as much as $21 billion being sold,
the strategist said.  VIX Jumps  The decline in stocks prompted investors to seek protection
against losses, driving up the cost of options for a third day.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , known as
the VIX, climbed 8.9 percent to 16.81.  The S&P Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME)  tumbled 4.2
percent, the most since June, as all of its 11 members fell.
Purchases of new U.S. homes declined 0.3 percent to a 373,000
annual pace following a revised 374,000 rate in July that was
higher than previously estimated, figures from the Commerce
Department showed. The median estimate of 71 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg called for a rise to 380,000.  PulteGroup dropped 4.7 percent to $15.30, while D.R. Horton
Inc. slid 3.9 percent to $20.90.  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  decreased 4.5
percent to $34.64.  Energy shares  in the S&P 500 slipped 0.9 percent. Crude
futures erased 1.5 percent as the U.S. government reported lower
oil demand.  Noble Corp. (NE)  retreated 2.9 percent to $35.17 while
 Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR)  fell 2.9 percent to $16.04.  Technology Shares  Technology shares in the S&P 500 dropped 0.8 percent.  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  fell for a third day, losing 1.2 percent to $665.18, after
earlier this week reporting debut weekend sales for the iPhone 5
that fell short of some analysts’ estimates because of supply
constraints. The shares are down 5 percent so far this week, for
the biggest three-day decline since May.  Jabil Circuit slid 9.9 percent, the most in the S&P 500, to
$18.90. The electronics supplier forecast first-quarter earnings
will be no more than 62 cents a share,  missing  the average
analyst estimate of 67 cents, as demand across most of its
business segments weakened.  NetApp Inc. (NTAP) , which Jabil counts among its biggest
customers, declined 4.2 percent to $32.98.  SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  fell 2.8 percent to $42.66. Alex Gauna, an
analyst with JMP Securities LLC, downgraded the biggest maker of
flash-memory cards to market perform from market outperform,
citing weakness in electronics demand and supply constraints.  Blyth Inc. (BTH)  tumbled 21 percent to $25.68. ViSalus, a health-
products business bought by the maker of candles and decorations
in 2008, withdrew its filing for an initial public offering,
citing “uncertain market conditions.”  Dean Foods Co. (DF)  climbed 5.5 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $16.23. The largest U.S. dairy processor said it’s
considering a sale of its Morningstar unit that sells  milk
products  to retailers and restaurants.  American Greetings Corp. (AM)  rallied 17 percent to $16.82. The
biggest publicly traded greeting-card company said Chief
Executive Officer Zev Weiss and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Weiss offered to take the company private for $17.18 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
