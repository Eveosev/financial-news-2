Iran ’s inflation rate is 29
percent, higher than the figure given by the central bank,
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani said, according to  Shargh 
newspaper.  The actual inflation rate is sometimes higher than that
announced by official bodies, Larijani said, according to the
Tehran-based newspaper. He also said that unemployment is above
14 percent.  Iran’s Central Bank said on Sept. 5 that the inflation rate
rose to 23.5 percent in the month that ended on Aug. 20 from
22.9 percent the previous month. Prices have been pushed up by
international sanctions aimed at curbing  Iran’s nuclear program ,
which have led to a slump in the rial’s value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
