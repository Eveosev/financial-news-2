Aqua Services and Engineering, a
unit of Veolia Water Solutions, will refurbish a seawater
desalination plant and boost potable water supplies in Walvis
Bay, where water scarcity has long been an issue.  Veolia Water is a division of Paris-based  Veolia
Environnement SA (VIE) , the largest water utility. The ASE unit will
install an energy recovery system to the reverse osmosis
membrane system to help the Namibia plant optimize power
consumption and adapt an air flotation filtration design, it
said in a statement. No terms for the contract were disclosed.  The plant should be operational in five to six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
