The former chief executive officer
of a New Jersey hedge fund pleaded guilty to a charge he
conspired to defraud investors of more than $4 million, federal
prosecutors said.  Michael J. Spak, 44, of Chesterfield, New Jersey, entered
his plea today before U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez in
Camden to one count of conspiracy to commit  wire fraud , U.S.
Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.  Spak and his co-conspirators were accused of soliciting
investors for the Osiris Fund, which they pitched as a hedge
fund for “little guys” and “mom and pops,” and then
improperly diverted $4 million for their own use starting in
January 2010, prosecutors said.  Spak and his co-conspirators spent $300,000 on a sport
fishing boat called the “Fintastic,” while continuing to list
the funds as assets, prosecutors said.  The fund incurred trading losses of about $4.5 million in
April and May 2010, about half of its value, yet Spak and his
co-conspirators never disclosed the losses, prosecutors said.
Instead, they created false financial statements that they sent
to investors that included a fictitious $5 million asset for
which they charged a 3 percent management fee, prosecutors said.  Spak faces as much as 20 years in jail and a $250,000 fine
at his sentencing, scheduled for Jan. 9, prosecutors said.  The case is U.S. v. Spak, U.S. District Court, District of
 New Jersey  (Camden).  To contact the reporters on this story:
