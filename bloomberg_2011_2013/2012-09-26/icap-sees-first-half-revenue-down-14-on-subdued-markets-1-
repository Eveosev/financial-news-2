ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest
broker of transactions between banks, expects fiscal first-half
revenue will be 14 percent lower than the previous year because
of “subdued” capital markets.  Pretax profit for the year ending March 31, 2013, will be
within the range estimated by analysts of 307 million pounds
($496 million) to 346 million pounds “if volumes in the second
half remain at current depressed levels,” the London-based
company said in a statement today.  Interdealer brokers are struggling with lower trading
volume and shrinking margins amid the euro-area crisis. ICAP
this year restructured its voice and electronic foreign-exchange
businesses to make annual savings of 50 million pounds.  “The macroeconomic environment remains difficult,” Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said in the statement. “We
will continue to take the necessary action to constrain our cost
base as well as position ICAP optimally for upcoming financial
regulatory reform.”  ICAP fell 5 percent to 326.6 pence at 8:16 a.m. in London
trading, the biggest fall since March 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
