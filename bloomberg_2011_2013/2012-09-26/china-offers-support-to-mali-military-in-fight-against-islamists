China  offered to support  Mali ’s
military in its fight against Islamist rebels who have seized
northern parts of the country, said Guo Xueli, charge d’affaires
at the Chinese Embassy.  “China firmly supports the position of Mali,” Guo said in
an interview on state television yesterday in the capital,
Bamako. “We are going to bring our assistance to the extent
possible, specifically in the military where we already have a
very old cooperation.”  Mali’s government has been battling Islamist rebels in the
north of the country since they took control of the area from
separatist ethnic Touareg fighters in May. The rebels took
advantage of a political crisis in the south triggered by the
ouster of President Amadou Toure in a March 22 coup.  The transitional government, led by Dioncounda Traore, has
been bogged down by internal power struggles and disagreement
over the need for foreign troops in the country, according to
the Brussels-based  International Crisis Group .  The interim president earlier this month formally asked for
military help from the Economic Community of West African
States. The  United Nations Security Council  said on Sept. 21 it
will consider a request from the 15-nation Ecowas for military
intervention against the Islamists.  France, Mali’s former colonial ruler, offered to provide
logistical support to any West African operation to retake
control of northern Mali, Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian
said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
