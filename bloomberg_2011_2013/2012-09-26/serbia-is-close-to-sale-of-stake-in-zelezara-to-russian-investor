Serbia  is close to agreeing the
sale of a majority stake in its sole steel mill  Zelezara
Smederevo d.o.o.  to a Russian investor, Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  said.  “We are very close to striking a deal,” Dacic told
reporters in Belgrade today after meeting the Russian company
yesterday. “This is a big Russian company, which has been
interested in Zelezara for months and they want their identity
disclosed once they agree to sign a memorandum of understanding.  The government has been trying to find an investor for
Zelezara Smederevo since January, when Serbia bought it back
from  U.S. Steel Corp (X)  who gave up the unprofitable plant.  The Russian company wants to manage Zelezara and invest
around 100 million euros ($129 million) with the government
retaining between 20 percent and 30 percent in the mill, Dacic
said, adding that this is not ‘‘a done deal yet.’’  Serbia wants to lure industrial investors as the economy
slows and the government tries to halt a further increase in
unemployment, already at 25.5 percent.  Dacic said the government will start overhauling the public
sector overhaul and introduce ‘‘more flexible’’ labor contracts
and curb ‘‘unnecessary public spending.’’  Serbia will talk to the  International Monetary Fund  ‘‘not
because we need their money, but because we need them as a proof
they support our policies,’’ Dacic said.  The lender said this month it would be monitoring Serbia’s
progress in reducing the deficit and changes to central bank law
before agreeing to a new loan deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
