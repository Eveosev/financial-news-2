Enel SpA (ENEL)  supports the European
Union plan to delay some auctions of emission permits as of 2013
to curb oversupply, said Giovanni Bertolino, head of carbon
regulation at the Italian power producer.  “Backloading can be a starting point, but we cannot assume
it’s enough,” he told a Platts conference in Brussels today.
“What we need is thinking about the future and a structural
reform of the ETS.”  The adequate volume of allowances that the EU should delay
at auctions in the next phase of its emissions trading system is
from one billion metric tons to 1.2 billion tons, according to
Bertolino. The allowances could be withdrawn from auctions in
2013 and 2014 and returned to the market in 2018-2020, he said.  The so-called backloading would give the EU time to prepare
a long-term market overhaul while avoiding a further decline of
prices, Bertolino said. It would also confirm the political
willingness of European governments to strengthen the cap-and-
trade system, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
