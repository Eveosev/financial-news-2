European Union regulators will urge
government agencies in the EU to use  cloud-computing services  to
reduce costs, according to a European Commission strategy for
cloud computing published today.  Public agencies in the EU, the bloc’s biggest buyer of
information technology services, and cloud-computing suppliers
will work together on common procurement requirements to ensure
that services meet governments’ needs, the commission said.  “Pooling public requirements could bring higher efficiency
and common sectoral requirements would reduce costs and enable
interoperability,” according to the  strategy paper  from the
commission, the 27-nation EU’s executive in Brussels.  In cloud computing, data and software are stored and
managed remotely, rather than on local software and hardware,
and are accessible from any internet-connected device such as
smartphones and tablet computers.  EU intervention  could help
cloud-computing revenues in the region climb to nearly 80
billion euros ($103 billion) by 2020, the commission said.  The EU also plans to help set technical standards and model
contracts for services, including data transfer, to encourage
cloud computing among European businesses, according to the
strategy paper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
