Philippine bonds rose and the peso
declined after central bank Governor Amando Tetangco signaled
that further interest-rate cuts are possible this year.  Local-currency notes also advanced after Deputy Treasurer
Eduardo Mendiola said yesterday the amount of debt to be sold at
regular auctions in the three months to December will probably
drop from this quarter. The yield on 20-year notes fell to 5.722
percent at an auction yesterday, the lowest since at least 2002,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “The central bank saying it still has room tends to
support bonds and is positive for markets in general,” said
Raul Tan, head of the balance-sheet segment of  Rizal Commercial
Banking Corp. (RCB) ’s Treasury Group in  Manila .  The peso fell 0.7 percent to 42.017 per dollar at the close
in Manila, its steepest drop since Aug. 15, prices from Tullett
Prebon Plc show. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
5.25 percent.  The government had a budget surplus of 2.52 billion pesos
($60 million) in August, narrowing the eight-month gap to 71.21
billion pesos, it reported today. Revenue last month rose 4.2
percent, while spending gained 10.4 percent.  Inflation Target  The yield on the Philippine government’s 6.25 percent bonds
due September 2014 fell 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage
point, to 2.59 percent, according to midday fixing prices at
Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  “We have the policy space,” Tetangco wrote in a Sept. 24
mobile-phone message, in reply to whether the central bank still
sees scope for further easing this year. “We will recalibrate
as appropriate, given we have the room.”  Bangko Sentral  ng Pilipinas kept its overnight borrowing
rate at a record-low 3.75 percent on Sept. 13 after three
reductions earlier in the year. Tetangco said Sept. 19 that
inflation, which accelerated to a seven-month high of 3.8
percent in August, was well within the central bank’s target.  “As far as the central bank’s inflation target is
concerned, there’s still room and the pressure on inflation
isn’t really there yet,” Tan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
