Kenya’s shilling weakened for a
second session as companies stepped up dollar purchases to cover
month-end payments.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy declined less
than 0.1 percent to 85.15 a dollar by 2:48 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, poised for its weakest closing level since June 13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is a good level of demand for the  U.S. dollar  from
importers and corporates for their usual month-end
commitments,” Sameer Lagadia, head of trading at  Diamond Trust
Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , said by phone from Nairobi.  Uganda’s currency dipped 0.7 percent to 2,540 a dollar,
heading for its lowest close since March 5, while the Tanzanian
shilling gained 0.1 percent to 1,574 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
