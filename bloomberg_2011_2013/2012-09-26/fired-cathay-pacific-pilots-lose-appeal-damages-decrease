Hong Kong ’s top court rejected an
appeal against a cut in defamation damages owed to a group of
former Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. pilots who were fired in 2001
during an industrial dispute.  The court upheld a cut in damages to HK$700,000 ($90,279)
each from HK$3 million that was made by a lower court in 2010.
It also ruled against the pilots’ request to reinstate awards of
HK$300,000 each for aggravated damages.  “The Court of Appeal were right to conclude that the award
of $3 million to each plaintiff could not stand,” Lord
Neuberger of Abbotsbury wrote in a Court of Final Appeal
 judgment  released today. The other four judges agreed.  The more than decade-long legal dispute centered on 18
pilots who were among 49 fired by Cathay on a single day in
2001. The group in November 2009 won a total award of HK$58.7
million, including damages for defamatory statements made about
them during the dispute. That was subsequently reduced by the
Court of Appeal.  The top court today upheld an award of HK$150,000 per pilot
for being fired because of their perceived participation in
union activities. It also reinstated the original trial judge’s
award of a month’s pay for wrongful dismissal.  It also reinstated an order that Cathay should pay the
pilots legal costs for the original trial.  Each of the 18 pilots, except Gregory Stephen England who
is deceased, will receive the defamation payment. Each, except
George Crofts who won a separate award from a U.K. court, will
receive the payment for having been unfairly fired.  The case is Blakeney-Williams Campbell Richard and Others
v.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  and Others, FACV13/2011 in the
Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
