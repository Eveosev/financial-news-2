Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
East African nation’s biggest lender by assets and outlets,
gained the most in more than four months on bets earnings will
continue growing in the second half.  The stock of KCB, as the lender is known, advanced 2.8
percent to 27.50 shillings as of the 3:00 p.m. close in Nairobi,
the capital, the biggest increase since May 3.  Earnings per share in the 12 months through December could
grow as much as 17 percent to 4.337 shillings a share, Davis
Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing Kenya
Ltd., said by phone today.  “It is mostly influenced by efficiency gains out of the
restructuring which they carried out last year,” he said.
“Especially staff costs have declined, impacting their bottom
line positively, and I expect loan uptake to increase after they
reduced their base lending rate.”  KCB on Sept. 14 said it would reduce its base loan rate to
19 percent from 22.5 percent starting Oct. 1. First-half profit
climbed to 6.09 billion shillings ($71.5 million) from 4.06
billion shillings a year earlier, as income from loans increased
and earnings from regional operations surged.  Investor  Mark Mobius , who oversees about $45 billion as
executive chairman of Templeton  Emerging Markets  Group, said
yesterday he’s considering buying shares in Kenyan banks,
Russian retailers and pharmaceutical companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
