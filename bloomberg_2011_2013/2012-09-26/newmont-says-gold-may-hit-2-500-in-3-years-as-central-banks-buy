Gold may rise to $2,500 an ounce in
three years as investors buy the metal as a hedge against
inflation, said  Richard O’Brien , chief executive officer of
 Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the second-biggest producer by sales.  Demand from central banks on price dips will probably help
create a floor for gold prices at around $1,600, O’Brien, 58,
said in a phone interview yesterday from Las Vegas, where he’s
attending the MINExpo conference.  “The downside is fairly limited,” the CEO of the
 Greenwood Village , Colorado-based company said. “If we see some
economic growth we could see $2,500 in the next three or four
years.” A global economic recession would be negative for all
commodities, including gold, O’Brien said.  Gold has risen for 11 straight years, reaching a record
$1,923.70 an ounce on Sept. 6, 2011, in  New York  as investors
add to holdings using exchange-traded products and central banks
expand reserves. O’Brien said in September 2011 that gold may
reach $2,000 an ounce by the end of that year and $2,300 by the
end of 2012.  Central banks and the  International Monetary Fund  were the
largest bullion owners with 29,500 metric tons at the end of
last year, or 17 percent of all mined metal, World Gold Council
data show.  O’Brien said central banks will probably purchase at
least 450 tons of gold next year as they buy the metal to
diversify reserves and protect against inflation.  Central banks bought 254.2 tons in the first half of 2012
and may add almost 500 tons for the full year, the London-based
World Gold Council said last month.  Kazakh Reserves  Kazakhstan expanded its  gold reserves  for a 13th
consecutive month in August, buying 1.4 metric tons, data on the
IMF’s website showed. South Korea bought 16 tons in July, and
Paraguay purchased 7.5 tons that month, the data show.  Gold for December delivery fell 1 percent to $1,748.70 at
9:59 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Gold futures have risen 11
percent this year. The metal will average $1,772 in 2013, $1,652
in 2014 and $1,540 in 2015, according to the median of analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are just in the middle of what will continue to be a
very  bull market  for gold coming into the future,” O’Brien said
in a Sept. 24 speech at the Las Vegas conference. The metal is
trading “more like a currency than like a commodity.”  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , based in Toronto, is the biggest gold
producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
