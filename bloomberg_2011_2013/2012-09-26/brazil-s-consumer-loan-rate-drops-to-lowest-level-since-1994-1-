Brazil’s  interest rates  on consumer
loans fell in August to the lowest level since 1994, while
 default rates  remained the highest in almost three years in the
largest emerging market after  China .  Average rates on consumer loans fell to 35.6 percent from
36.2 percent, the central bank said in a report distributed
today in Brasilia. The average is the lowest since the bank
began monitoring the number in 1994. Rates on corporate loans
fell to 23.1 percent from 23.6 percent, while the average rate
on loans fell to 30.1 percent from 30.7 percent in July.  Government officials led by President  Dilma Rousseff  have
expanded measures aimed at spurring credit growth while helping
indebted consumers. Earlier this month, the government reduced
bank reserve requirements to free up 30 billion reais ($14.8
billion) in credit. This month, federally controlled Caixa
Economica Federal cut rates on its  credit card  used for home
remodeling, and offered new payment grace period options.  Since August 2011, policy makers have also cut benchmark
interest rates by 500 basis points to a record low 7.5 percent,
extended tax cuts on  consumer goods  and pressured commercial
banks to lower lending rates. This week, Osasco, Brazil-based
Banco  Bradesco (BBDC4)  SA announced plans to reduce by half interest
rates charged on its credit cards. The bank’s preferred stock
fell 6.64 percent yesterday on the Sao Paulo exchange.  The stimulus measures may be gaining traction.  Consumer
confidence  rose in August for the first time in five months.
Retail sales in July beat economists’ forecasts and rose at the
second-fastest pace since January, while vehicle sales reached a
record high in August.  Consumer Default  Even as average loan rates fell, the consumer default rate
in August was 7.9 percent, unchanged from July and the highest
since 8 percent in November 2009. The company loan default rate
rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent a month ago.  The consumer default rate will decline by year-end as wage
growth and more caution on the part of banks help to ease
indebtedness, Tulio Maciel, head of economic research at the
central bank, said to reporters today.  Outstanding credit rose 1.2 percent in August from the same
month last year to 2.2 trillion reais ($1.1 trillion), the
central bank said today. Credit expanded 17 percent from a year
ago. The central bank boosted its forecast for credit growth
this year to 16 percent from 15 percent, Maciel said.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.72 percent at
3:23 p.m. local time. The real declined 0.2 percent to 2.0338
per dollar.  Brazil’s economy  expanded  at an annualized 1.64 percent in
the second quarter, less than the U.S. and  Japan . This month,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  reduced his 2012 growth forecast
to 2 percent from 3 percent, adding that the economy will expand
more than 4 percent next year. Economists in the latest weekly
central bank survey predicted growth of 1.57 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
