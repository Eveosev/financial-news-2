OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, fell the most in more than two months as concern that
global stimulus measures won’t be able to revive economic growth
reduced appetite for riskier assets.  The shares declined 3.1 percent to 3,800 forint by the
close in Budapest, the biggest slide since July 23. The
benchmark BUX stock index, in which OTP has a 29 percent
 weighting , slumped 1.4 percent.  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles
Plosser yesterday said more bond purchases by the U.S. central
bank probably won’t boost growth and may jeopardize its
credibility. Hungary’s gross domestic product will expand 0.7
percent next year versus a 0.8 percent projection published in
June, the central bank said yesterday. This year’s GDP will
decline 1.4 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent fall seen
earlier, the bank said.  “Sentiment was spoilt by the comments from one of the Fed
presidents who said the new asset purchases didn’t make much
sense,” Gergely Gabler, a Budapest-based analyst at broker
Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-mailed report today.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index slumped 1.3 percent,
retreating for a third day to the lowest since Sept. 13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Daniel Gyuris, a deputy chief executive officer at OTP,
sold 14,705 shares at an average price of 3,900 forint, OTP said
in a  statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
