OAO Surgutneftegas, a Russian oil
producer, has withdrawn from the Junin 6 block in the Orinoco
crude belt,  Kommersant  reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the situation.  The Consorcio Nacional Ruso, a venture between Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, the state oil company, with OAO Gazprom,
Surgutneftegas, OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP and Rosneft Oil Co., starts
drilling in the Junin 6 block today, according to the newspaper.
Junin 6 was Surgutneftegas’s last international holding,
Kommersant said.  Surgut’s stake may be divided between the other venture
partners or transferred to Rosneft, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
