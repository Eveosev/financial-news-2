Standard Parking Corp. (STAN) ’s
acquisition of Central Parking Corp. won U.S.  Justice Department 
approval after an agreement to sell some assets.  The Justice Department, in court filings today in
Washington, said the company must divest itself of its interests
in 107 parking facilities within the next 90 days. The
facilities are located in 29 cities in 21 states, including
Atlanta, Boston and Baltimore, according to a department
statement.  The deal, which combines the two largest U.S. parking-lot
operators, is valued at about $345 million, according to court
documents.  “Consumers have benefited from lower parking prices
because of competition between Standard and Central in many
urban central business districts,” Acting Assistant Attorney
General  Joseph Wayland , who heads the antitrust division, said
in a statement. “These divestitures will ensure that consumers
in the affected cities and states will receive better
services.”  Chicago-based Standard Parking, which manages 1.2 million
parking spaces across North America, announced in February that
it agreed to buy Central Parking from private-equity interests.  Central Parking is owned by affiliates of private-equity
firm Kohlberg & Co., Lubert-Adler Partners LP and Versa Capital
Management LLC.  The case is U.S. v. Standard Parking Corp., 12-cv-01598,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
