Rubber dropped for a third day as
concerns grew that stimulus measures by central banks around the
world may not be enough to boost global growth, sapping investor
appetite for the commodity used to make tires.  March-delivery rubber, the contract with the largest volume,
fell to 251.3 yen a kilogram ($3,231 a metric ton) and was at
252.9 yen on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange at 10:24 a.m. The
most-active contract has gained 5.3 percent this quarter,
trimming this year’s loss to 4 percent.  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles
Plosser  said new bond buying announced by the U.S. central bank
this month probably won’t boost growth or hiring. Asian stocks
extended a global decline, while oil fell from the lowest close
in seven weeks, cutting the appeal of natural rubber.  “The market came under pressure amid concerns that central
banks can do little to revitalize economies,”  Kazuhiko Saito ,
an analyst at broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said today by phone.  Losses in futures were limited by speculation that buyers
in  China , the world’s largest consumer, will step up purchases
ahead of holidays, he said. Markets in China will be closed next
week for the National Day holiday.  January-delivery rubber gained 0.8 percent to 23,850  yuan 
($3,783) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board fell 0.5 percent to 96.75 baht ($3.13) a kilogram
yesterday, Rubber Research Institute of Thailand data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
