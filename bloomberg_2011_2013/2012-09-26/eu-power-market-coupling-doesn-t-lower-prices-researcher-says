The European Union’s efforts to
connect the bloc’s electricity networks isn’t lowering average
prices as intended, according to a research group in Brussels.  Market coupling doesn’t reduce average wholesale power
prices, Georg Zachmann, a research fellow at the Bruegel
institute said in a  study  published on its website. The Germany-
Nordic market was cited as an exception, where connecting those
nations from 2008 led to “significantly” lower prices.  “ Europe  has been fighting to introduce an internal market
and one of the reasons for doing so was creating larger market
zones which would bring down electricity prices,” he said today
by phone from Berlin.  The EU has set a target to complete market coupling by
2015, allowing power to flow to areas where prices are higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
