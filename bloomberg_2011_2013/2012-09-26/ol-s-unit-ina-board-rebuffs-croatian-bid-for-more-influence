INA Industrija Nafte d.d. ’s
management board rebuffed the Croatian government’s call for
more influence in the refinery controlled by Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) 
as the two sides squabble over the company’s future.  The Mol-dominated board yesterday determined the company’s
governance follows legal requirements, it said in an e-mailed
statement. Mol owns 49.1 percent and the government holds 44.84
percent. INA’s government-appointed board members yesterday
demanded weekly management board meetings and requested all
information be shared among all board members.  The proposal was the latest attempt in a series of efforts
by  Croatia  to increase its influence in INA. The Budapest-based
refiner won controlling rights of the company in a shareholding
agreement in 2009.  Croatia, through a supervisory board, appoints three
members in the six-member management board. Board President
Zoltan Aldott, a former Mol executive, has a swaying vote.  Former Croatian Premier Ivo Sanader is on trial in Zagreb
for allegedly taking a bribe from Mol Chairman  Zsolt Hernadi 
between 2008 and 2009, when he was still premier, in exchange
for ceding control of INA. Sanader and Mol have denied the
accusations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
