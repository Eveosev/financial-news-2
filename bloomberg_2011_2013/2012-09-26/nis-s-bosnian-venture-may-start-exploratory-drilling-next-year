Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) ,
majority-owned by  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , said its joint
venture with a unit of OAO Zarubezhneft may start drilling for
oil and gas in Bosnia-Herzegovina next year.  The first exploratory drill is planned for the first
quarter of 2013, based on seismic surveys by Jadran-Naftagas
d.o.o, the NIS’s venture with Neftegazinkor, the company said
today in an e-mailed statement. The location of the drill will
be determined after the seismic data is processed, the Novi Sad,
Serbia-based company said.  The companies secured a 28-year oil and gas concession last
year from Republika Srpska, the Serb half of Bosnia, and pledged
$40.7 million for exploration and $188.3 million for possible
production, if commercial reserves are found, NIS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
