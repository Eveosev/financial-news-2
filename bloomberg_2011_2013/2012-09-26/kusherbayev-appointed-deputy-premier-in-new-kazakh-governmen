Kazakh President  Nursultan Nazarbayev   named  Krymbek Kusherbayev as deputy prime minister as
he forms a new government following the departure of the Central
Asian nationâ€™s longest-serving premier.  Nazarbayev announced the appointment in a decree published
today on his website. He said yesterday that Oil and Gas
Minister Sauat Mynbayev, Finance Minister Bolat Zhamishev,
Deputy prime minister Kairat Kelimbetov and most other members
of the previous government would keep their posts. Karim Massimov resigned as premier on Sept. 24 after almost six years
and was replaced by Serik Akhmetov.  Nazarbayev, who has ruled since 1989, has replaced top
government officials and the head of state energy producer
KazMunaiGaz National Co. after oil-rich western  Kazakhstan 
suffered labor strikes and violent protests in December 2011
when workers demanded higher pay in the Mangistau region.
Kusherbayev resigned as head of that region at the time and was
named as an  adviser  to Nazarbayev in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
