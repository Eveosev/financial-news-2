TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , the phone carrier
that operates in 17 countries, said Swedish police have
collected information from its offices as authorities open a
probe into allegations of bribes in Uzbekistan.  TeliaSonera, whose largest shareholder is the Swedish
government with a 37.3 percent stake, said the anti-corruption
unit of the Swedish Prosecuting Authorities has started an
investigation after a television report alleging bribes and
money laundering in Uzbekistan.  “We welcome” the probe, the Stockholm-based company said
in a statement on its website today. “TeliaSonera will
cooperate fully with the investigation.”  The operator has faced a backlash from Swedish media after
state-run television channel SVT on Sept. 19 alleged
TeliaSonera’s payments of 2.2 billion kronor ($332 million) for
telecom licenses in  Uzbekistan  to a Gibraltar-based company
constituted a bribe. Chief Executive Officer Lars Nyberg denied
the allegations and said the company has started its own
investigation into the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
