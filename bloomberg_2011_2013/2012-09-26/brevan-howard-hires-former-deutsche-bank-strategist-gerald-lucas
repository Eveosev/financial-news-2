Brevan Howard Asset Management LLP,
the $36.7 billion hedge fund that counts  Alan Howard  among its
founders, hired former Deutsche Bank AG investment strategist
Gerald Lucas.  Lucas, 62, was a senior  investment adviser  at Frankfurt-
based Deutsche Bank, where he was part of team of researchers
that developed trading strategies. He declined to comment when
reached by phone today at his Brevan Howard office in  New York .  Deutsche Bank said in July that it will eliminate about
1,900 positions, mostly outside Germany, in a bid to boost
profits. The bank is targeting an after-tax return on equity of
at least 12 percent by 2015 as management overhauls the firmâ€™s
compensation system and reduces headcount and costs.  Prior to joining Deutsche Bank in New York in 2006, Lucas
was a government bond strategist at Banc of America Securities
LLC. He worked at Merrill Lynch & Co. for 16 years before that,
Deutsche Bank said in a  statement  when he was hired.  Officials at London-based Brevan Howard declined to
comment, as did  Amanda Williams , a spokeswoman for Deutsche
Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
