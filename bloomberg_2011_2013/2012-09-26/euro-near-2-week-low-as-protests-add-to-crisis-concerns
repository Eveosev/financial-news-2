The dollar declined against most of
its major counterparts as Asian stocks extended gains, reducing
demand for haven assets.  The greenback weakened against the Australian dollar after
China’s central bank pumped a record amount of money into the
financial system this week, spurring speculation the nation will
act to support growth. Demand for the euro was limited before
Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  submits a fifth package of
budget cuts as demonstrators gathered in Madrid yesterday.  “Chinese stocks are gaining amid speculation that China
may announce stimulus measures,” reducing demand for haven
assets such as the dollar, said Akira Moroga, manager of
foreign-exchange product group at Aozora Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .
“It mitigates some risks of a slowdown in  China’s economy  that
has been causing  risk aversion .”  The dollar traded at 77.70 yen at 7:19 a.m. in  London  from
77.75 yesterday, when it touched 77.59, the lowest since Sept.
14. The greenback lost 0.1 percent to $1.2888 per euro.  The yen slid 0.1 percent to 100.15 per euro. It gained for
the past seven trading days, the longest winning streak since
the eight days ended May 31. The Australian dollar advanced 0.4
percent to $1.0414.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares rallied 0.9 percent
after earlier falling as much as 0.2 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index added 2.8 percent.  Chinese Stocks  China’s  stocks  climbed for the first time in three days.
The People’s Bank of China injected a net 365 billion  yuan 
($57.9 billion) via reverse-repurchase operations and bill
redemptions this week, the most since Bloomberg started
compiling the data in 2008, compared with 101 billion yuan last
week. The monetary authority offered 130 billion yuan of 28-day
reverse repo agreements and 50 billion yuan of 14-day contracts
today, according to a statement.  Gains in the euro were limited after Spanish bonds dropped
yesterday, sending the yields on 10-year securities above 6
percent for the first time since Sept. 18. Catalan President
Artur Mas called early elections for Nov. 25, as Rajoy struggles
to gain acceptance for austerity measures and faces criticism
from European leaders for delaying a decision on an
international bailout for the nation.  The euro has weakened 3.2 percent this year, the worst
performance after the yen among the 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar has weakened 2.6 percent.  “When you see austerity protests going on across  Europe ,
that concerns the broader market and it certainly will make
investors more cautious of taking a long euro position,” said
 Thomas Averill , managing director in Sydney at Rochford Capital,
a currency and interest-rate risk management company.  A long is a bet that an asset will rise. Averill said he
expects the euro to weaken to $1.26 in the next 10 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
