EDP-Energias de Portugal SA 
acquired a portfolio of solar projects in  Romania  with total
capacity of 60 megawatts,  Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing
Monica Cojocaru, a lawyer in charge of the sale.  EDP,  Portugal â€™s biggest utility, may spend about 120
million euros ($154 million) on the projects, the newspaper
said, citing its own calculation.  The Portuguese company also bought a 28-megawatt wind
project, adding to its existing projects in Romania, ZF cited
