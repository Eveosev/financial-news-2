Russia  will reduce October crude
exports from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk after one cargo
of 80,000 metric tons was dropped, a final loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Shipments from the port will be 3.7 million tons next
month, or 874,871 barrels a day, according to the plan. A
consignment, owned by OAO Russneft, for loading on Oct. 21 to
Oct. 22 was dropped from the preliminary schedule released
yesterday, while a top-up lot of 40,000 tons was added.  Exports are 15 percent more than the 3.226 million tons
planned for September. The Novorossiysk program for October
includes three 80,000 ton cargoes of Siberian Light grade. The
remaining 32 lots, totaling 3.46 million tons, are Urals blend.  Exports from the  Baltic Sea  will be unchanged from the
preliminary plan at 5.605 million tons for Primorsk and 2.1
million tons for Ust-Luga, according to the final program.  The final schedule will be released later this month.
Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
