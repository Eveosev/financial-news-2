Treasury 10-year notes rose for an
eighth day, the longest run of gains since December 2008, amid
speculation Federal Reserve efforts will fail to revive the
economy and Europe’s debt crisis will deepen.  Benchmark yields dropped to a two-week low after Fed Bank
of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said yesterday more
bond purchases by the central bank probably won’t boost growth.
Investors also sought safer assets after the President of
Spain’s Catalan region called early elections and police clashed
with protestors in  Madrid , adding to concern Europe’s financial
turmoil is worsening. U.S. notes were also boosted as gauges of
U.S. inflation expectations fell over the past week.  “While we judge the valuation of Treasuries as being rich
at these levels, yields are unlikely to rise much from here
given inflation expectations remains subdued,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European interest-rate strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank in London. “There is
still concern about the U.S. economic outlook, especially on the
employment front.”  The 10-year  yield  dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.65 percent at 10:01 a.m.  London  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
note due in August 2022 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face
amount, to 99 3/4. The yield dropped to 1.64 percent, the lowest
level since Sept. 10.  Plosser said the Fed’s latest round of bond purchases, or
quantitative easing, may jeopardize its credibility.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on Sept. 13 it will
buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per
month until the labor market improves. Policy makers have turned
to unconventional tools to tackle unemployment that has stayed
above 8 percent since February 2009.  Treasuries returned 0.4 percent since the end of June,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. German debt
gained 0.5 percent, and Japanese  government bonds  rose 0.4
percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
