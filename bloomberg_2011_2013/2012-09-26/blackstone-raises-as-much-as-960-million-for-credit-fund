Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the world’s
biggest buyout firm, raised as much as $960 million for its
third closed-end fund investing in non-investment grade
corporate debt.  The Blackstone/GSO Strategic Credit Fund pooled $834.8
million in an initial public offering and may be increased to as
much as $960 million if the underwriters exercise an option to
buy additional shares, according to a statement distributed
today by Business Wire.  GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit-investment arm of New
York-based Blackstone, is a “strong believer in the long-term
opportunity in below-investment grade corporate credit,”  Dan Smith , a senior managing director at Blackstone, said in the
statement.  Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., UBS
AG and Wells Fargo & Co. are the lead underwriters of the
closed-end fund, which began trading today on the  New York  Stock
Exchange under the ticker  BGB. (BGB)   Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank AG raised a $563.9
million collateralized loan obligation for GSO, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities
of varying risk and return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
