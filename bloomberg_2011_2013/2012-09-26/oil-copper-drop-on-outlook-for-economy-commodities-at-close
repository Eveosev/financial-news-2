time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped
0.5 percent to 1,613.079.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell to the lowest level in seven weeks after a report
showed rising U.S. stockpiles and the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said a new stimulus plan
probably won’t boost economic growth.  Crude for November delivery fell as much as $1.04 to $90.33
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $90.35 at 9:20 a.m.  London  time. Futures
slid 56 cents to $91.37 yesterday, the lowest close since Aug.

futures fell $8.39, or 8.3 percent, to $92.98 a metric ton at
11:15 a.m. Singapore time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This spread narrowed for the first time since Sept.
20, signaling refining profits from making the fuel have fallen.
Naphtha swaps for October dropped $10.50, or 1.1 percent, to
$923 a ton, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
broker.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude was at $19.49 a barrel, up

Gasoil swaps for October fell 20 cents, or 0.2 percent, to
$126.55 a barrel, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  Copper dropped on concern that stimulus measures announced
by central banks from the U.S. to Japan, won’t be enough to
bolster global economic growth, curbing demand prospects for
industrial metals.  Copper for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.1
percent to $8,185 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $8,200 at 4:15 p.m. in  Tokyo . The metal is up 7.7
percent this month, the most since January. December-delivery
metal lost 0.6 percent to $3.7375 a pound on the Comex.  January-delivery copper closed little changed at 59,150
yuan ($9,381) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, set for a
quarterly advance. Financial markets in  China , the biggest
consumer, will be closed next week for the National Day holiday.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold gained in London on signs demand is strengthening in
euros and Indian rupees.  Gold in euros jumped 0.4 percent today and in Indian rupees
climbed 0.3 percent, the first increase in a week. Prices in
dollars have gained 10 percent this quarter, the most in two
years, as the  Federal Reserve  took more steps to boost growth.
The Fed said its third quantitative easing, started Sept. 13, is
open-ended until employment improves. The U.S. unemployment rate
probably rose this month, economists said before the Oct. 5
report.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 0.1 percent to $1,762.85
an ounce by 10:12 a.m. in London. The futures declined 0.1
percent to $1,765.20 an ounce on the Comex in  New York .  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans dropped, paring a fourth quarterly advance in
 Chicago , as rainfall improved planting conditions in  Brazil  and
the harvest in the U.S. accelerated, boosting global supplies of
the oilseed.  The November-delivery contract fell as much as 0.8 percent
to $15.99 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at
$16.0225 at 12:54 p.m. in Singapore. Prices, which touched a
record this month as drought hurt the U.S. crop, have risen 12
percent since June 30. The May-delivery contract fell as much as
0.7 percent to 4,916  yuan  ($779) a metric ton on China’s Dalian
Commodity Exchange, and was at 4,923 yuan.  Corn for December delivery was little changed at $7.44 a
bushel in Chicago, set to gain 17 percent this quarter after
reaching an all-time high last month on the U.S. drought. Wheat
for December delivery was also little changed at $8.855 a bushel
in Chicago, set to advance 17 percent this quarter.  Corn for January delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent to
2,344 yuan a ton in Dalian, and traded at 2,346 yuan. January-
delivery wheat dropped as much as 0.8 percent to 2,510 yuan a
ton on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, and was at 2,513 yuan.  Rubber dropped for a third day as concerns grew that
stimulus measures by central banks around the world may not be
enough to boost global growth, sapping investor appetite for the
commodity used to make tires.  March-delivery rubber, the contract with the largest
volume, fell to end at 253.4 yen a kilogram ($3,266 a metric
ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active contract
has risen 5.5 percent this quarter, trimming this year’s loss to
3.8 percent.  Palm oil  fell, heading for the biggest quarterly loss since
2008, on concern that stimulus measures will fail to revive
global economic growth, potentially boosting stockpiles in the
biggest producing countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
