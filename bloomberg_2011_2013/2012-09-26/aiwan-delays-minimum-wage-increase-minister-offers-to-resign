Taiwan  will postpone an increase in
the monthly minimum wage next year as the economy slows,
prompting the labor minister to offer her resignation.  The 1.4 percent increase, which was due at the start of
next year, will be delayed until the island registers two
consecutive quarters of economic growth above 3 percent or if
the jobless rate falls below 4 percent for two months, Premier
Sean Chen said in a press briefing in Taipei today.  Taiwan’s economy grew 0.4 percent in the first quarter and
contracted 0.18 percent in the second quarter. The seasonally
adjusted jobless rate was 4.29 percent last month. Labor
Minister Wang Ju-hsuan, speaking to legislators and reporters,
said she offered her resignation after the delay.  “I will discuss with the minister and hope she can stay to
work together,” Chen said. A planned increase in the hourly
 minimum wage  will take effect as planned from Jan. 1, he said.  The Council of Labor Affairs on Aug. 9 proposed increasing
the  minimum monthly wage to NT$19,047 ($648) and lifting the
hourly wage to NT$109 from NT$103.  Taiwan last month cut its growth forecast for 2012 to 1.66
percent from 2.08 percent previously, as  Europe ’s debt crisis
and a faltering U.S. recovery crimped exports. The island’s
consumer price index rose 3.42 percent in August from a year
earlier, the fastest pace in four years, after typhoons damaged
crops and pushed up food costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
