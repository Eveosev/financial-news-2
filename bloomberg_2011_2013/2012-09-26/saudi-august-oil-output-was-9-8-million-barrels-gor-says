Saudi Arabia ’s daily crude oil
production averaged 9.753 million barrels last month and its
supply to the market was 9.835 million barrels, according to the
Gulf Oil Review.  “Sources at the Saudi oil ministry say the kingdom will
continue to produce at these levels if needed and remains
committed to meeting higher customer demand,” the report said.  Maintaining  price stability  at about $100 a barrel is a key
strategic objective for Saudi Arabia, the newsletter said,
citing unidentified sources in the country’s oil ministry.  The report is published by Petroleum Policy Intelligence, a
researcher in Winchester, U.K., founded by Bill Farren-Price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
