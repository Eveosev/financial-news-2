Natural gas futures advanced in New
York to the highest level in two weeks as concern eased that
supplies would test storage limits before demand picks up with
colder weather.  Gas rose 3.4 percent as the October contract expired. U.S.
stockpiles gained 77 billion cubic feet last week, based on the
median of  20 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Supplies
totaled 3.496 trillion cubic feet as of Sept. 14, below the
Energy Department’s estimated capacity of 4.239 trillion. The
agency’s weekly supply report is scheduled for release tomorrow.  “The market continues to find some buying from the end-of-
the-month expiration trading,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“Without worries that we are going to see a flood of gas in the
physical market if storage is full, the market can look a little
more toward the winter heating season.”  Natural gas for October delivery jumped 9.9 cents to $3.023
per million British thermal on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the first settlement above $3 since Sept. 13 and the biggest
increase since Sept. 11. The futures have climbed 7 percent
since June, heading for a second straight quarterly gain.  The November futures  contract  climbed 11 cents, or 3.5
percent, to 3.215 per million Btu.  November $3.50 calls, bets that prices will rise, were the
most actively traded options in electronic trading. They rose 2
cents to 5.2 cents on volume of 788 at 2:50 p.m.  Gas has rebounded 59 percent from a decade low of $1.902 on
April 19 as hotter-than-normal weather and fuel switching from
coal spurred record demand from  power plants .  Gas Plants  Electricity generators have been burning about 27.3 billion
cubic feet a day of gas so far this month, up 21 percent from
the same period last year, according to data from LCI Energy
Insight, an energy analysis and consulting company in El Paso,
 Texas .  Temperatures from the Northeast and across the Midwest will
be above normal Oct. 1 through Oct. 5, according to Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland . New York City’s high on
Oct. 3 may be 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius) and Chicago may
see a high of 78 degrees on Oct. 5, 11 above normal,  Cooling demand nationwide will be 13 percent above normal
over the next seven days, Weather Derivatives in Belton,
 Missouri , said today.  Nuclear-power production is hovering near the lowest
seasonal level in a decade as reactors were shut for refueling
or unplanned work. Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually
undertaken in the U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest,
can increase gas consumption for electricity generation.  Nuclear Plants  Generation fell 0.3 percent to 85,017 megawatts, or 84
percent of capacity, after dropping to 84,520 megawatts on Sept.
22, the least since June 4, according to filings with the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Output was 5.8 percent lower than a year earlier.  “The main fundamental support is coming from the above-
normal level of nuclear power generating facilities that are
currently down,” along with fuel switching from coal at power
plants and the outlook for a more normal winter, Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute
in  New York , said in a note to clients today. Last winter was
the fourth warmest on U.S. record.  Tomorrow’s inventory report may be “slightly bearish”
with the possibility that the injection number will exceed the
historical norm, he said.  Stockpile Range  Estimates for the stockpile report for the week ended Sept.
21 range from gains of 69 billion to 84 billion cubic feet. The
five-year average increase for the week is 76 billion and
supplies rose by 104 billion the same week of 2011, Energy
Department data show.  An inventory surplus in the week ended Sept. 14 narrowed to
8.6 percent to the five-year average for the week, declining
each week since rising to six-year high of 61 percent on March
30, department data show.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
337,104 as of 2:51 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 370,000. Volume was 326,603 yesterday. Open interest was 1.07
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.11 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
