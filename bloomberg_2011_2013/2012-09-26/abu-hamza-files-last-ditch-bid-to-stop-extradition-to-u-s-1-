Abu Hamza al-Masri, an Islamic
cleric jailed for inciting murder and racial hatred, sought a
U.K. injunction today to prevent his extradition to the U.S.  A judge reviewed the applications from him and a second man
and blocked their extraditions pending an Oct. 2 hearing on
their appeals, according to an e-mailed statement from the
London court.  The Grand Chamber panel at the  European Court  of  Human
Rights  rejected on Sept. 24 appeals by Abu Hamza and four other
alleged terrorists to fight the court’s April decision allowing
the U.K. to extradite him. He was indicted in the U.S. in 2004
and lost bids to block his extradition in British courts before
turning to the European tribunal, claiming his human rights
would be at risk if he were to be sent to the U.S.  The U.K.  Home Office  will work “to ensure they are handed
over to the U.S. authorities as soon as possible,” it said in
an e-mailed statement on Sept. 24.  The U.S. seeks to prosecute Abu Hamza on charges he
supported the Taliban with money and troops, set up a terrorist
training camp in Bly,  Oregon , in 2000, and aided a kidnapping
plot that left four hostages dead in Yemen in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
