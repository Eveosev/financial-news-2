The  National Football League  and
its locked-out officials continued contract talks today, a
person with direct knowledge of the negotiations said. ESPN
reported that an agreement in principle might be near enough to
have regular officials on the field this weekend.  The league, which has faced criticism as it used
replacement officials from the college ranks and below for the
first three weeks of the season, and the NFL Referees
Association are in a dispute over pensions and performance
evaluations.  Officials from the two sides met two days ago and talked
until 2 a.m. yesterday, then resumed negotiations that are still
going on, according to the person who spoke on the condition of
anonymity because the talks are private.  Walt Disney Co.’s ESPN is  reporting  that enough progress
has been made that the two sides are discussing the possibility
of having the locked-out officials return to work for this
weekend’s games.  Players, coaches and even announcers on NFL game broadcasts
have criticized the replacements. The scrutiny reached new
heights on Sept. 24 when the  Seattle Seahawks  beat the Green Bay
Packers 14-12 with a last-second touchdown on a disputed end-
zone catch by Golden Tate.  The NFL said it stood by the call after a review, but
critics -- including U.S. President  Barack Obama  and Republican
presidential nominee  Mitt Romney  -- said it was time to get the
replacement officials off the field. Obama called the touchdown
ruling “terrible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
