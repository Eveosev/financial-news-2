Viterra Inc. (VT)  extended the date for
completing its proposed C$6.1 billion ($6.2 billion) takeover by
 Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  by a month while the companies await
regulatory approval from China’s Ministry of Commerce.  The companies expect to get approval under Chinese anti-
monopoly law by Nov. 15, Regina, Saskatchewan-based Viterra said
in a statement today.  Glencore, the largest publicly traded commodity supplier,
agreed to buy Viterra to add grain assets in Canada and
Australia as growth in Asia boosts demand. The Baar,
Switzerland-based company said July 15 it received approval for
the deal from the Canadian government.  Fei Deng, a senior vice president at Edgeworth Economics
LLC in  San Francisco , said the delay was most likely due to
understaffing and doesn’t mean the deal won’t be approved. Only
one deal has been blocked in the last four years.  “In general, it takes longer for MOFCOM to get clearance
than other jurisdiction such as the U.S. and the EU,” Deng
said. “They are much smaller than their counterparts in the
U.S. and they’re processing an increasing number of deals.”  Viterra gained 2 cents to C$16.08 at 12:11 p.m. in Toronto.
Glencore fell 2.4 percent to 338.45 pence at the close in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
