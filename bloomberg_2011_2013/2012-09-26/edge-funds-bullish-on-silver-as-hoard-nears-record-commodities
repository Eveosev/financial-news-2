Hedge funds  are the most bullish on
silver in seven months and investors’ holdings are expanding
toward a record on speculation the metal will outperform gold as
central banks seek to boost growth.  Wagers on rising prices jumped 10-fold since June, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Investors bought
717.2 metric tons valued at $797 million through exchange-traded
products this quarter, the most in a year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices will increase for at least the
next three quarters and average $38 an ounce in the three months
through June, or 9.9 percent more than now, based on the median
of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  If history is any guide, silver will beat gold after the
 Federal Reserve  announced a third round of debt-buying and
central banks from  Europe  to  Japan  pledged more action. Silver
rose about 53 percent in the Fed’s first quantitative easing
from December 2008 through March 2010, twice as much as gold,
and 24 percent during the second phase ending in June 2011,
three times as much. Silver will probably keep beating gold in
the next several quarters, Morgan Stanley predicts.  “The recent announcements on the part of central banks
really sparked the rally,” said  Peter Sorrentino , who helps
manage $14.6 billion of assets at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. “Silver has now become a two-way play, getting bids
both on industrial demand as well as a monetary hedge.”  U.S. Drought  Silver, used in televisions to solar panels, climbed 24
percent to $34.635 in  London  this year, beating gold’s 14
percent gain. It is this quarter’s best performing commodity.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 materials rose 2.4
percent in 2012 and the  MSCI (MXWD)  All-Country World Index of equities
gained 11 percent. Treasuries returned 2.3 percent, a Bank of
America Corp. index shows.  Some investors buy gold and silver as a hedge against
inflation and a weaker dollar.  Inflation expectations  measured
by the break-even rate for five-year Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities rose to the highest since May 2011 on Sept.
17. The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure against six major trading
partners, weakened 8.1 percent since the end of November 2008.  The Fed said Sept. 13 it will buy $40 billion of mortgage
debt a month and probably hold the federal funds rate near zero
until at least the middle of 2015. Precious metals generally
earn returns only through price gains, increasing their allure
as  interest rates  decline.  Silver Coins  Hedge funds and ETP investors’ bullishness has yet to
extend to demand for American Eagle silver coins, a market
valued at about $1.4 billion in 2011 based on metal content. The
 U.S. Mint  sold 25.8 million ounces since the start of January,
23 percent less than a year earlier, data on its website show.  Central bankers are increasing stimulus because of concern
about growth. Industrial applications account for 53 percent of
silver demand. International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  said in a speech in  Washington  on Sept. 24
that the group sees global growth “a bit weaker” than it had
forecast in July. The fund expected growth of 3.5 percent this
year and 3.9 percent in 2013.  “The slowdown impact is not over as yet for industrial
metals including silver,” said Dan Denbow, a  fund manager  at
the $2.1 billion USAA Precious Metals & Minerals Fund in  San
Antonio . “The money coming in today because of all the easing
will not impact the economy for six months or so.”  Industrial Demand  Weaker industrial demand would leave investors with a
bigger glut to absorb. Production will exceed consumption for a
fifth year in 2013, leaving a surplus of 5,095 tons, Barclays
Plc estimates. Higher prices may also encourage more recycling.
Scrap supplies jumped 10 percent in 2010 as prices almost
doubled, according to Barclays.  Silver  imports  by  China , the second-biggest user after the
U.S., reached a one-year high in August, customs data show. The
nation’s growth will accelerate to 8.5 percent next year from 8
percent this year, the International Monetary Fund estimates.  Hedge funds  raised their net-long position to the highest
since Feb. 28 in the week ended Sept. 18, holding a combined
30,986 futures and options, CFTC data show. Investors now own
18,601.4 tons through ETPs, or 0.2 percent below the record set
in April 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  While the metal is trading 31 percent below the record
$49.79 set in April 2011, this year’s average of $30.67 is the
second-highest ever.  Coeur d’Alene  That will boost profit for  Coeur d’Alene Mines Corp. , which
gets about 65 percent of its revenue from silver. Net income
will jump 39 percent to a record $129.7 million this year,
according to the mean of five analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shares (CDE)  of the Coeur d’Alene, Idaho-based company rose
19 percent this year and will climb 6.3 percent to $30.59 in 12
months, according to the average of seven forecasts.  Pan American Silver Corp. (PAAS) , based in  Vancouver , will report
profit of $264.6 million next year, from $212.2 million, the
mean of five estimates shows. Shares of the  company  fell 0.5
percent in  New York  trading since the start of January and will
rise 7.3 percent to $23.31 in the next 12 months, according to
the average of 14 forecasts.  “In this accommodative monetary policy scenario, silver
seems to be trading as an alternative currency,” said  Michael Cuggino , who manages about $17 billion at San Francisco-based
Pacific Heights Asset Management. “If the global economy picks
up, silver will show some strength from industrial demand.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
