Producer-price inflation in Ghana,
 Africa ’s second-biggest gold miner, slowed to 16.6 percent in
August as manufacturing costs eased, according to the Ghana
Statistical Service.  The  rate  declined from a revised 19 percent in July,
Philomena Nyarko, acting government statistician, told reporters
in Accra, the capital, today. Prices rose 0.3 percent in the
month, she said.  Manufacturing costs in West Africa’s second-biggest economy
slowed to 18.6 percent from 20.3 percent a month earlier,
according to the agency. Mining and quarrying costs eased to
16.9 percent in August from 20.3 percent in July, while utility
rates were little changed at 10.5 percent, Nyarko said.  South Africa  is the continent’s biggest gold producer.
Companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. and Newmont Mining
Corp. operate in  Ghana , while units of Diageo Plc and Unilever
Plc are among the largest manufacturers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
