Lance Easley, the National Football
League referee at the center of a touchdown call criticized by
President  Barack Obama  and others, is a vice president of small
business banking at  Bank of America Corp.  in California.  Easley’s LinkedIn page says he has worked at the bank since
June 2011, and was a business banking specialist at  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  for almost three years prior to that. Bank of America
spokesman T.J. Crawford confirmed in telephone interview
Easley’s current employment, declining to comment further.  Part of a group of replacement officials that the NFL is
using during the lockout of its normal crews, Easley was in the
end zone on Sept. 24 when Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate was awarded a game-winning touchdown catch that appeared to
be first intercepted by Green Bay Packers defensive back M.D.
Jennings. Easley was the first to signal touchdown, which was
upheld on video review.  The call sparked immediate controversy, with fans and
players taking to Twitter to complain about the decision. Obama,
who labeled it a “terrible” decision, called for a settlement
in the labor dispute between the league and Referees
Association.  Easley’s position at Bank of America was earlier reported
by  American Banker .  To contact the reporter on this story:
