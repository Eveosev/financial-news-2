Gazprombank,  Russia ’s third-largest
lender and a unit of the natural gas export monopoly, hired Erik DePoy as an equity strategist as it expands into  investment
banking .  DePoy, who was chief research editor at Troika Dialog and
previously an equity strategist at  Alfa Bank , joined the Moscow-
based lender three weeks ago, he said in an interview by
telephone today.  “We will start putting out English language research
dailies in the coming weeks as the bank expands its coverage
from Russian,” DePoy said.  Russian investment banking is dominated by state lenders
VTB Group and OAO Sberbank. VTB Capital, a unit of Russia’s
second-largest bank, became the top organizer of domestic debt
and equity sales in 2010, two years after hiring more than 100
bankers from Deutsche Bank AG. Sberbank, the nation’s largest
lender, acquired Moscow’s oldest brokerage Troika Dialog in
January for an initial $1 billion.  Renaissance Capital , the
brokerage partly owned by billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov , has
been losing market share to both VTB Capital and Sberbank.  DePoy was approached for the position by Gazprombank’s head
of research Andrei Bogdanov, a former Alfa Bank colleague who
was recently named deputy head of the bank’s asset management
unit, he said. Alexey Demkin has since been appointed acting
research chief, DePoy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
