A Belgian pilots’ group is
examining whether  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) ’s bid for  TNT
Express NV (TNTE)  will cost European pilots’ jobs, Le Soir reported.  U.S. pilots for UPS and its smaller rival  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  may
fly parcels within Europe, a right not extended to European
pilots in the U.S., according to a statement from the  Belgian
Cockpit Association  cited by Le Soir.  Any dismissal of European pilots and replacement by U.S.
pilots, who aren’t required to pay European tax and social
security, would create a social drama and reduce tax revenue for
European governments, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
