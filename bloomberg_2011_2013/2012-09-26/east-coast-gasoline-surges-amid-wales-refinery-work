Gasoline on the East Coast rose to
the highest level in almost two weeks as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
shut a crude unit at the Pembroke refinery in Wales and
inventories in the region reached a four-year low.  The European plant is shutting all main production units,
including a catalytic cracker and a coker, during the
maintenance,  Bill Day , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.
Irving Oil Corp.’s Saint John refinery in  New Brunswick , which
exports more than half of its production to the U.S. Northeast,
had an explosion in a tank at its hydrogen plant during planned
work.  East Coast  stocks  of reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
dropped to 13.7 million barrels, the lowest level since Oct. 3,
2008, according to the Energy Department.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in New York Harbor, rose 4.88 cents to 19.88 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
1:58 p.m. It’s the highest level since Sept. 14. Prompt delivery
jumped 13.15 cents to $3.2486 a gallon.  The “overpressure” in a carbonate tank Irving’s Saint
John plant isn’t expected to affect output because of the
maintenance. Irving is conducting work “within select areas”
of the plant and expects the maintenance to be completed over
the next few weeks, Lesley Dickson, a company spokeswoman, said
in a Sept. 19 e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
