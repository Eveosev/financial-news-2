Thai Beverage Pcl (THBEV)  and TCC Assets
Ltd., owned by Thai billionaire  Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi , said
they will vote this week against  Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN) ’s plan to
distribute S$4 billion ($3.2 billion) to shareholders.  The two companies will vote against F&N’s cash distribution
proposal at the shareholders meeting on Sept. 28, ThaiBev said
today in a statement to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Shareholders in the meeting will also vote on Dutch brewer
 Heineken NV (HEIA) ’s offer to buy F&N’s stake in  Asia Pacific Breweries
Ltd. (APB) , or APB.  F&N said last month it plans to distribute to shareholders
about S$4 billion of the proceeds from the sale of APB through
capital reduction of one for every three F&N shares. The
proposal requires the approval of 75 percent of shareholders to
proceed. F&N recommended that holders accept Heineken’s
increased S$53-per-share bid for the 40 percent stake in APB in
August. ThaiBev and TCC Assets have an aggregate stake of about
30.66 percent in F&N, ThaiBev said in the statement today.  Charoen’s ThaiBev and TCC said earlier this month that they
will back Heineken’s S$5.6 billion offer for F&N’s beer business,
which may pave the way for the Thai billionaire to take control
of F&N’s other assets. The Dutch brewer agreed not to make a
competing offer for F&N’s other assets.  TCC Assets, controlled by 68-year-old Charoen, made an S$9
billion bid for the 70 percent of F&N he doesn’t control on Sept.
13, offering S$8.88 a share for the conglomerate.  It is the largest takeover announced by a Thai company in
at least 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
successful bid by Charoen’s companies would add fast-growing
soft drinks, dairy and real-estate businesses to their portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
