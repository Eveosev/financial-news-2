KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by Henry Kravis and  George Roberts , formed a joint venture
with Hines to develop a master-planned business park in Houston
as it seeks to expand in real estate deals.  The partnership will build the Pinto Business Park, owned
by Pinto Realty Partners, a subsidiary of Cockrell Interests
Inc., KKR said in a statement today. Roads and drainage are
already designed for the 971-acre (392-hectare) property,
Houston’s largest development-ready business park.  The transaction is the fourth this year for KKR’s real
estate team. The private-equity firm, which last year hired
former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executive Ralph Rosenberg as its
first head of real estate, earlier this month joined with two
other companies to buy the management business of  Sunrise Senior
Living Inc. (SRZ)  for $130 million as part of Heath Care REIT Inc.’s
acquisition of the senior-housing owner.  “Pinto Business Park will offer manufacturing clients the
benefits of a large-scale, controlled business-park setting, and
distribution clients the benefit of a second-to-none location,”
Palmer Letzerich, managing director at Hines, a Houston-based
property investor, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
