A joint statement on euro-area
direct bank recapitalization yesterday by the German, Dutch and
Finnish finance ministers didn’t contradict a pledge made by
leaders of the 17 countries that share the single currency at a
June summit, a Finnish official said.  Irish borrowing costs rose after  Wolfgang Schaeuble , Jan Kees de Jager and Jutta Urpilainen said the European Stability
Mechanism, the euro-area’s permanent rescue fund, “can take
direct responsibility of problems that occur” in
recapitalization programs under a proposed single bank
supervisor, “but legacy assets should be under the
responsibility of national authorities.”  The Finnish official reiterated this stance, saying it’s
natural that the ESM could only take responsibility for problems
that arise after the  European Central Bank  assumes its role as
the single supervisor for euro-area lenders.  In a June 29 statement, euro-area leaders said the ESM
could recapitalize banks directly, with appropriate
conditionality, once an “effective” single supervisory
mechanism is established. The leaders’ statement doesn’t mention
“legacy assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
