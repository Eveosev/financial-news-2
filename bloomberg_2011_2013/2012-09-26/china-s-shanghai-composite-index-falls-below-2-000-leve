China ’s Shanghai Composite Index
fell below 2,000, heading for the first close below that level
since January 2009, on concern the government isn’t loosening
monetary policy fast enough to counter the slowdown in the
economy.  The benchmark index dropped to as low as 1,999.48 and was
down 1.3 percent to 2,002.45 as of 2:58 p.m. local time. The
Shanghai Composite reached a record high of 6,092.06 on Oct. 16,
2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
