The tally for  Sotheby’s (BID)  two-day
auction of Brooke Astor’s gems, paintings and hundreds of other
objects soared past estimates to total $18.8 million.  The auction house had assigned a high presale estimate of
$9.7 million to the 901 lots in “Property From the Estate of
Brooke Astor.” The sale included pieces from Astor’s former
Park Avenue duplex and her Westchester mansion, Holly Hill.  Not much was left behind as 95 percent of the lots found
buyers. The proceeds will benefit Astor’s favorite charities,
including the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art, the  New York Public
Library , the  Animal Medical Center  and New York schools. Astor
died in 2007 at the age of 105.  The top lot was “A Memlook Bey,  Egypt ,” an 1868 oil on
panel by John Frederick Lewis, which sold for $1.6 million, more
than three times its high estimate of $500,000. (The prices
include the buyer’s premium; the estimates do not.)  A drawing by Giovanni Antonio Canal, known as Canaletto,
sold for $1.2 million, surging past its presale estimate range
of $300,000 to $500,000.  “The Deer and the Lady, with Punchinello” by Giovanni
Domenico Tiepolo brought $722,500, also surpassing its high
estimate.  Items that seemed like bargains before the sale quickly
rose in price. A giltwood box shaped as a pile of logs was
estimated between $200 and $400; it sold for $21,250. A small
ivory elephant adorned with rubies, emeralds and gold fetched
$68,500, more than 10 times its low estimate.  A lot comprising two Chinese famille-rose boxes and covers
of the Qianlong period fetched $494,500, almost 50 times the low
estimate of $10,000.  ‘Her Provenance’  A bronze figure of a six-headed Tibetan deity that was
expected to sell for $2,500 to $3,500 went for $134,500 Monday
at  Sotheby’s. (BUD)   “I was going to bid on it, but it went through the roof,”
said Philip Marshall, Astor’s grandson. “It’s her provenance.”  Astor loved dogs and her numerous dog paintings attracted
active bidding. In all, 73 lots of dog paintings totaled
$816,130, more than double their combined high estimates.  A picture of a thoughtful spaniel estimated between $4,000
and $6,000 fetched $37,500. An 18th-century portrait of a black-
eared dog sold for $53,125, above the high estimate of $20,000.
“King Charles Spaniel With a Red Slipper,” painted in the 19th
century, went for $13,750, more than tripling the high estimate.  Ivan Turgenev  More than 6,000 books from her two libraries tallied about
$147,000. A lot containing about 700 volumes from her  New York 
apartment by mostly 19th-century authors, including Sir Walter
Scott, Ivan Turgenev and Honore de Balzac, fetched $74,500,
almost 15 times the high presale estimate. Astor’s books from
Holly Hill were divided by subjects such as science, world
travel,  New York City  and poetry.  About 860 volumes of art and
architecture books sold for $17,500, against the presale
estimate range of $1,500 to $2,000. A lot of 57 cooking books
fetched $5,313, 35 times the high estimate of $150.  A Bulgari diamond necklace featuring 13 emerald drops sold
for $686,500. It had a high estimate of $350,000. An enlarged
photograph of Astor wearing the necklace while standing next to
former President  Lyndon B. Johnson  at a Plaza Hotel dinner dance
was hung in the salesroom, along with photos of Astor and former
President  Bill Clinton  and  Princess Diana .  Muse highlights include  Manuela Hoelterhoff  on opera,  Ryan
Sutton  on dining.  To contact the reporters of this story:
