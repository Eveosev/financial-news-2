Chinese stocks  in New York slid to
a two-week low as the Shanghai Composite Index’s slump below a
key level for the first time in three years stoked concern
government efforts to avert a slowdown won’t be sufficient.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. dropped for a third day, losing 0.6
percent to 90.22 yesterday in New York. The decline followed the
Shanghai gauge’s descent below 2,000 for the first time since
2009.  7 Days (SVN)  Group Holdings Ltd. surged to a four-month high
after China’s second-biggest budget hotel owner got a buyout
proposal from a group of private equity firms.  The People’s Bank of China has reduced  interest rates  twice
this year and said on Sept. 17 it will  focus (FMCN)  on  price stability 
as policy makers seek to revive the economy.  Standard & Poor’s 
cut the outlook for Chinese growth in 2012 by half a percentage
point to 7.5 percent this week. The median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for expansion to slow to 7.4
percent in the third quarter, from 7.6 percent in the second.  “The mere fact that the Shanghai stock index dropped below
2,000 could have a negative psychological effect on investors
and create fear that leads to additional selling pressure,”
Kevin Pollack, a managing director at Paragon Capital in  New
York , said by phone yesterday. “Investors have not been
satisfied with the effectiveness of stimulus measures and
expected to see more action taken by China’s government to
counter the slowdown.”  ‘Non-Binding’ Offer  Guangzhou-based 7 Days jumped 13 percent to $11.95 in New
York, the highest level since May 7. A group led by the  Carlyle
Group LP (CG)  and Sequoia Capital, and existing shareholders
including the company’s co-chairmen Boquan He and Nanyan Zheng
made a “non-binding” proposal to buy the company, according to
a statement from 7 Days.  Washington-based Carlyle was part of a group that made a
$27 per share offer for Focus Media Holding Ltd., a Shanghai-
based advertising company listed in the U.S., on Aug. 13. Focus
retreated 0.5 percent to $23.11 yesterday.  BYD Co., the Chinese carmaker partly owned by  Warren
Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , dropped for a fifth day in
the U.S., after CLSA Asia Pacific Markets cut its price target
by 94 percent. BYD tumbled 7.3 percent to $3.41 as its Hong
Kong-listed shares tumbled 9.8 percent.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., declined 0.9 percent to
$33.89, extending its slump to a third day. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  lost 0.6 percent to 1,433.32 as concern grew
that Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Spreadtrum Slumps  Mobile-chip designer  Spreadtrum Communications Inc. (SPRD) , based
in Shanghai, sank 3 percent to a three-week low of $19.4 in New
York.  Eric Chen, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets  Hong Kong 
Ltd., reduced his  recommendation  on Spreadtrum to underperform
from buy yesterday, saying the company’s share of the global TD-
SCDMA smartphone chip market is likely to fall to 36 percent in
2013 from an estimated 50 percent this year. RBS Asia Ltd.
analyst Jack Lu also downgraded the stock to hold from buy.  Qihoo 360 Technology Co., a computer software developer
which started a new online search engine in August, dropped 2.6
percent to $22.22, the lowest level this month.  CDH Net Technology Co., a private investor in Qihoo, filed
to sell 300,000 of Qihoo’s American depositary receipts on Sept.
17, according to a document made public yesterday. CDH sold
900,000 of the ADRs from Aug. 24 to Sept. 13, the filing shows.  Solars Drop  Most solar makers declined after EU ProSun, an industry
group led by Germany’s  Solarworld AG (SWV) , filed an anti-subsidy
complaint on Sept. 25 at the European Commission in Brussels,
accusing Chinese exporters of solar panels of receiving trade-
distorting government aid.  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP) , the world’s largest solar-panel
maker, sank 4.3 percent to a one-week low of 88 cents in New
York. LDK Solar Ltd., the second-largest maker of wafers in the
world, plunged 4.8 percent to a record low of $1.19.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., based in Baoding of
China’s northern province of Hebei, said in a statement
yesterday it never received any illegal subsidies from the
government and is “fully transparent” with funding sources and
cost. Yingli declined 1.7 percent to $1.71.  The  Shanghai  Composite Index fell 1.2 percent yesterday to
2,004.17, the lowest since January 2009. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong slid
1.2 percent to 9,628.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
