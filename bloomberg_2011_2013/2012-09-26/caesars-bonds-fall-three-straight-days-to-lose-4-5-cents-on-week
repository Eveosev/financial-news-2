Caesars Entertainment Corp. (CZR)  bonds
fell for a third consecutive day, losing 4.5 cents on the dollar
this week as a junk-bond benchmark declined by the most since
June.  The largest U.S. casino owner’s $3.3 billion of 10 percent
second-lien notes due December 2018 dropped 2 cents to 64 cents
at 11:20 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Regulatory Authority. The
securities yielded 20.5 percent.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond
 fund , which holds 2.7 percent of the 10 percent debt and is the
biggest public owner, dropped to 91.5 cents, marking the biggest
three-day decrease since June 4, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. Because exchange-traded funds hold such a substantial
portion of Caesars’ bonds, prices are more susceptible to
volatility when money either moves into or out of those funds.  The company, taken private by affiliates of  Leon Black ’s
 Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  and  David Bonderman ’s TPG Capital
for $30.7 in 2008, has reported 10 consecutive  quarterly  net
losses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Caesars had
$22.7 billion in  total debt  as of June 30, according to an Aug.
8 regulatory filing. The company’s bonds have an average
weighted maturity of 5.7 years, Bloomberg data show.  Bonds of Las Vegas-based Caesars had seven trades of more
than $1 million as of 11:03 a.m. New York time, Trace data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
