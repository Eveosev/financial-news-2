Oil rebounded from the lowest close
in almost two months and extended gains on speculation that
 China  will take measures to stimulate its economy.  Futures rose as much as 1.6 percent in New York after
falling close to technical-support levels. The Shanghai
Securities News reported speculation that China’s Securities
Regulatory Commission would announce 10 market-boosting measures
today. Prices slid 1.5 percent yesterday, the third consecutive
day of declines, over concern that the  European debt crisis  may
worsen and derail the global economy. Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy  will meet with ministers today to approve an
austerity budget for next year.  The market “undershot a decent support level” yesterday,
said  Harry Tchilinguirian , BNP Paribas SA’s head of commodity
markets strategy. “It is benefiting from speculation that China
may take measures to stimulate the economy, pending news coming
out of  Spain ,” he said by telephone from  London .  Oil for November delivery gained as much as $1.46 to $91.44
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $91.17 at 1:35 p.m. London time. The
contract yesterday fell $1.39 to $89.98, the lowest close since
Aug. 2. Prices are down 5.5 percent this month and up 7.3
percent this quarter.  Brent oil for November settlement rose $1.43, or 1.3
percent, to $111.47 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark grade’s premium to West
Texas Intermediate was at $20.39 after closing yesterday at
$20.06, the widest since Aug. 16.  Technical Support  Oil in  New York  is rebounding after approaching technical
support at $88.35 a barrel. That’s the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of the rise to $99 on Sept. 14 from the 2012 low of
$77.69 in June. Crude also gained after settling below its lower
Bollinger Band at $90.12 a barrel yesterday. The last time it
closed below the band on Sept. 20 it increased 1.1 percent the
next day. Buy orders tend to be clustered near chart-support
levels.  Prices fell yesterday as Spanish protesters marched for a
second night in  Madrid , calling on Rajoy to reverse austerity
measures as his nine-month-old government prepared its fifth
package of budget cuts. The nation’s 10-year bond yields rose
above 6 percent, approaching the levels seen before European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  offered to buy struggling
nations’ debt.  Striking Greeks  In  Greece , schools, hospitals, ferries and government
services shut down yesterday in the first walkout since
February. Thousands of protesters streamed into the central
Syntagma Square in  Athens , opposite the Parliament House. The
Greek government is planning an austerity package that Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras says is vital to keep the nation in the
euro area.  U.S. crude inventories slid 2.45 million barrels to 365.2
million last week, the Energy Department said yesterday.
Analysts polled by Bloomberg had forecast a gain of 1.9 million
barrels.  “The inventories surprised the market and stabilized
prices,” Thina Saltvedt, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB, said by
telephone from Oslo.  U.S. total fuel use decreased 1.1 percent to  18.4 million
barrels  a day, the lowest level since April 6, in the four weeks
ended Sept. 21 and crude stockpiles last week were at the
 highest level  for this time of the year since 1990, according to
the Energy Department report.  Gasoline Storage  Gasoline inventories dropped 481,000 barrels last week, the
Energy Department said. They were projected to gain 500,000
barrels, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in the
survey. Distillate supplies, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, declined 482,000 barrels compared with a
forecast 500,000 barrel increase in the survey.  U.S.  oil production  surged last week to the highest level
since January 1997 after output rebounded from August shutdowns
in the  Gulf of Mexico  because of Hurricane Isaac. Output rose by
3.7 percent to 6.509 million barrels a day in the week ended
Sept. 21, the Energy Department said.  The nation met 83 percent of its energy needs in the first
six months of the year, department data show. Imports have
declined 3.2 percent from the same period a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
