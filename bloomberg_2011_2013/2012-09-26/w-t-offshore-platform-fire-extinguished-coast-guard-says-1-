A sheen near a  W&T Offshore Inc. (WTI) 
platform in the  Gulf of Mexico  is being investigated after a
fire on the platform.  The fire is out and the entire plant has been shut in, Dave
Smith, a Washington-based spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement, said by e-mail. The agency
is investigating the sheen, which measures 600 yards by a half-
mile, he said.  The platform is at Ship Shoal Block 223, about 40 miles
south of Louisiana, he said. The agency received reports of the
fire at about 11:30 a.m. New York time.  “It appears to have been a minor situation that is now
under control,” Lisa Elliott, a spokeswoman for the company who
works for Houston-based Dennard Rupp Gray & Lascar LLC, said by
e-mail. “The fire is out and the injuries were very minor.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
