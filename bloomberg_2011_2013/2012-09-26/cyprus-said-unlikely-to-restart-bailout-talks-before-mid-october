Officials of the so-called troika
that oversees euro-area bailouts are unlikely to return to
Cyprus to restart bailout talks until at least mid-October, a
Cypriot official said.  The talks will probably have to wait until Cypriot Finance
Minister Vassos Shiarly returns from an International Monetary
Fund meeting in  Tokyo  that concludes Oct. 14, the official said
on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.
Shiarly will also attend a meeting of European finance ministers
in Luxembourg Oct. 8-9.  Cyprus on June 25 became the fifth country in the euro area
to seek external aid. Euro-area finance ministers agreed to
begin talks two days later. No amount was specified for the
rescue, which will encompass the public sector as well as banks.
Cyprus also sought assistance from  Russia  and the IMF.  The Cypriot government’s counter-proposal to the troika,
composed of officials from the European Commission, the  European
Central Bank  and the IMF, is “essentially complete,” spokesman
Christos Christofides said on Sept. 24.  A previous draft of the counter-proposal was rejected by
communist President Demetris Christofias, and a “milder’
version was prepared, the official said.  The draft will be discussed with political parties and
social partners before it’s submitted to the troika, according
to Christofides.  To contact the reporter on this story:
