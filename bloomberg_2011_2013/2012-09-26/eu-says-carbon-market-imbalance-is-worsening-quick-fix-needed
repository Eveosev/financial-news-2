The European Union’s carbon market
needs a “quick measure” to curtail a growing oversupply of
permits which may double by the end of next year, a European
Union official said.  The oversupply was around 950 million metric tons at the
end of 2011 and is “growing fast,”  Jos Delbeke , Director
General for Climate at the European Commission, told a Platts
conference in Brussels today.  The commission, the EU’s regulatory arm, has a “strong
ambition” to see a decision on its proposal to delay some
auctions of permits to curb oversupply by the end of this year,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
