The European Commission will
complete an assessment of the impact from planned carbon auction
delays ‘in the coming weeks,’ according to an EU official.  The commission hasn’t yet decided on the number of permits
it will officially propose to hold back from carbon-permit sales
from 2013, a process known as backloading,  Jos Delbeke , Director
for  Climate Change  at the EU’s executive arm, told a conference
in Brussels. The impact assessment will give the commission the
basis for such a decision, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
