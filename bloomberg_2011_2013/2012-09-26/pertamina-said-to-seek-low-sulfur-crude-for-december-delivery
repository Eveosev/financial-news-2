PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-
owned oil company, is seeking to buy low-sulfur crude for
delivery in December, said two people who participate in the
market, asking not to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak to the media. The tender will close at 11
a.m. Singapore time tomorrow.  The company earlier this month bought 950,000 barrels of
Libya’s El Sharara and 1.2 million barrels of Cossack for
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
