Asian  stocks  fell amid concern
stimulus measures by central banks won’t be enough to boost
global economic growth and as more than 900 companies in  Japan ’s
 Topix Index (TPX)  traded ex-dividend today.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s biggest mining company, fell
1.3 percent in Sydney as prices for oil and metals fell.  BYD
Co. (1211) , the Chinese carmaker partly owned by  Warren Buffett ’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., tumbled 9.8 percent in Hong Kong as
CLSA Asia Pacific Markets cut its price target by 94 percent.
 Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (ST)  retreated 3.9 percent after
sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holdings Pte offered to sell
S$1.28 billion ($1 billion) of shares in Southeast Asia’s
biggest phone company.  Investors are “finally realizing that recently announced
liquidity injections from central banks will do nothing to
address the structural issues,” said Matthew Sherwood, Sydney-
based head of markets research at Perpetual Investments, which
manages about $25 billion.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped 1.3 percent to 121.70
as of 6:30 p.m. in Tokyo, with more than three stocks falling
for each that rose. The gauge has gained 3.4 percent this month.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average and the Topix both fell 2
percent. More than 900 companies on the latter gauge traded
without the right to a dividend today, including bearing-maker
NTN Corp., which sank 5.8 percent to 163 yen.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.8 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite dropped 1.2 percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  retreated 0.3 percent and South Korea’s Kospi Index fell
0.6 percent. Singapore’s  Straits Times  slipped 0.8 percent and
Taiwan’s Taiex declined 0.8 percent.  Global Stimulus  The MSCI Asian benchmark climbed 3.8 percent this quarter
as central banks in Europe, the U.S., Japan and China took
action to stimulate economic growth. The gauge has climbed 6.9
percent this year compared with a 15 percent gain on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a 13 percent jump on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. The Asian benchmark traded at 12.8 times
estimated earnings compared with 13.9 for the  S&P 500  and 12.2
for the Stoxx Europe 600.  Futures on the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent today. The gauge
yesterday fell for a fourth day, retreating 1.1 percent for its
biggest decline since June 25, after Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said new bond buying
announced by the Fed this month probably won’t boost economic
growth or hiring and may jeopardize the central bank’s
credibility.  Commodities Drop  BHP, which is also Australia’s biggest oil producer, fell
1.3 percent to A$32.81 in Sydney as crude dropped toward a two-
month low and copper and aluminum also fell. Honda Motor Co.,
which gets 44 percent of its auto sales in  North America , slid
4.2 percent to 2,438 yen in Tokyo. Toyota Motor Corp. dropped
2.7 percent to 3,100 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported
Asia’s No. 1 carmaker will extend its suspension of production
in China.  Glencore International Plc (805) , the world’s largest publicly
traded commodities supplier, dropped 4.8 percent to HK$43 in
Hong Kong. The shares resumed trading today after the company
said it will take a smaller stake in Kazakh zinc producer
Kazzinc. Glencore is planning to spend about $43 billion in cash
and shares to acquire Xstrata Plc, Kazzinc and Canadian grain
handler Viterra Inc.  China’s central bank yesterday added a record 290 billion
 yuan  ($46 billion) to the financial system using reverse-
 repurchase agreements , seeking to address a cash squeeze in the
run-up to a weeklong holiday. The People’s Bank of China
conducted 190 billion yuan of 28-day reverse repos and offered
100 billion yuan of 14-day contracts, according to a trader at a
primary dealer required to bid at the auctions. That’s the
highest for a single day in data compiled by Bloomberg going
back to 2004.  China Policy  The PBOC yesterday reiterated it will pursue prudent
monetary policy, according to a statement posted to its website
following a quarterly meeting of its monetary policy committee.  Japan’s biggest manufacturers probably grew more
pessimistic this quarter as China’s economic slowdown and
Europe’s debt crisis sapped exports, economists surveyed by
 Bloomberg News  forecast before a report due next month.  The Bank of Japan’s Tankan report will show Oct. 1 that its
measure of  business confidence  deteriorated to a reading of
minus 4, the fourth straight quarter that pessimists outnumbered
optimists, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. That would mark the longest string of
negative readings since Japan emerged from the global recession
in mid-2010.  BYD lost 9.8 percent to HK$13.26. CLSA lowered its 12-month
price goal for the Hong Kong-traded shares to 41 Hong Kong
cents, from a previous estimate of HK$7.40.  Singapore Telecommunications lost 4.2 percent to S$3.19.
Temasek is selling 400 million shares in Singapore
Telecommunications, representing a 2.5 percent stake, at S$3.20
each, according to two people with knowledge of the deal, who
asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public.
The price is a 3.9 percent premium from yesterday’s close.  To contact the reporters on this story:
