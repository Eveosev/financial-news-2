Lafarge Cement WAPCO Nigeria Plc (WAPCO) ,
the country’s second-biggest producer of the building material
by market value, rose to the highest in more than four years on
speculation it will sustain first-half profit growth.  The stock gained 1.8 percent to 57 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, the highest since May 2008.  Lafarge’s net income for the half-year through June surged
to 8.8 billion naira ($56 million) from 3.2 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based company, a unit of  Lafarge SA (LG) , the
world’s biggest cement maker, said on Jul. 31. Revenue jumped 47
percent to 43.3 billion naira.  The stock is rising on its “excellent” half-year
result,” David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Lambeth Trust
and Investment Co. Limited said by phone. “The likelihood of
the fundamentals, especially the profit after tax, being
sustained is very high,” he said. Results for the third quarter
are expected to be released from the second week of October, he
said.  Lafarge WAPCO took 45 billion naira in loans to expand its
plant at Ewekoro in southwestern  Nigeria . The new production
facility is now contributing to income, Adonri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
