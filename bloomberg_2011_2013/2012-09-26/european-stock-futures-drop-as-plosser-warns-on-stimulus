European stocks slid the most in
two months as Spain prepared to present its budget and Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said the
third round of bond buying may fail to stimulate growth.  Acciona SA (ANA)  sank 9.9 percent, leading Spanish builders lower
a day before the government presents its budget for next year.
 Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s largest lender, retreated 4.5
percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  lost 3.7 percent after saying that
it plans to reduce its production of coal.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index plunged 1.8 percent to 270.72 at
the close, its largest drop since July 23. The equity benchmark
has still  rallied 16 percent from this year’s low  on June 4 as
European Central Bank policy makers approved a plan to buy the
bonds of the most-indebted members of the euro area.  European (SXXP) 
equities trade at 12 times their estimated earnings, close to
the highest valuation since 2010.  “Markets have started to turn,” said Andreas Utermann,
global chief investment officer at Allianz Global Investors,
which oversees $360 billion, in a television interview. “People
are facing up to the reality of a macro economy that’s not good.
We’ve seen QE3 and now we’re back to the real world. Monetary
easing doesn’t necessarily produce growth.”  Plosser said yesterday after the close of European trading
that the Fed’s latest round of quantitative easing may
jeopardize the central bank’s credibility. The  S&P 500  posted
its biggest drop since June 25.  Asset Buying  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on Sept. 13 that it
will buy mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per
month until the labor market improves. Policy makers have turned
to unconventional tools to attack  unemployment  that has stayed
above 8 percent since February 2009.  In Spain, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has struggled to
persuade people to accept the deepest austerity measures on
record. Unions and protest groups, spurred by the Portuguese
government’s decision to drop a planned tax increase following
demonstrations, have demanded a referendum on Rajoy’s cuts.  Economy Minister Luis de Guindos will present additional
measures tomorrow that the European Commission requires as part
of efforts to bring down Spain’s borrowing costs. Budget
Minister Cristobal Montoro will unveil the 2013 budget.  In Greece today, public- and private-sector workers will
hold a 24-hour general strike.  National benchmark indexes fell in every western-European
market except for Greece. Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index (IBEX)  sank 3.9
percent, France’s CAC 40 tumbled 2.8 percent and Germany’s DAX
slid 2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 lost 1.6 percent.  Construction Companies  Acciona slumped 9.9 percent to 45.09 euros, its biggest

yesterday.  Acciona surged 64 percent  over that time, while ACS
soared 56 percent and OHL jumped 29 percent.  A gauge of banks contributed the most to the Stoxx 600’s
retreat as Spanish lenders slid. Santander sank 4.5 percent 5.92
euros, while  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  declined 4.8
percent to 6.20 euros. The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year
