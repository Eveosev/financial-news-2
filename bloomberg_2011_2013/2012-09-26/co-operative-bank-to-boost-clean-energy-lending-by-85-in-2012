The Co-Operative Bank wants to
increase renewable-energy lending by 85 percent this year.  The bank expects to lend 464 million pounds ($751 million)
to clean energy projects this year, up from 251.4 million pounds
in 2011, Jenna Moss, a spokeswoman, said by phone today.  In the first half of the year, the bank financed 17 energy
projects with 232 million pounds, three times more than it lent
in the same period of 2011, according to an e-mailed statement.  “Nowadays, it is not only companies who are investing in
renewable energy projects,” James Sutcliffe, the bank’s
renewable energy manager, said in the statement. “We have seen
the U.K. public begin to embrace renewable energy as a viable
alternative to traditional energy sources.”  The U.K. government is overhauling its  electricity market 
to attract more investment in low-carbon energy sources in a bid
to meet a goal of getting 15 percent of its energy from
renewables by 2020. It already offers feed-in tariffs for
smaller scale projects and operates the so-called Renewables
Obligation system to reward clean energy generators for power
produced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
