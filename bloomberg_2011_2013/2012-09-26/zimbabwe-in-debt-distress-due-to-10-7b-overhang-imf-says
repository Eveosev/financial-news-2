Zimbabwe ’s almost $11 billion in
debt puts it in “distress” and impedes the southern African
nation’s sustainability because it’s 113 times gross domestic
product, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  The country’s total external debt is “estimated at $10.7
billion at end-2011, of which 67 percent of GDP are in
arrears,” the fund said on a  statement  on its website.  “The large debt overhang remains a serious impediment to
medium-term fiscal and external sustainability.”  Government operations recorded a cash deficit of 0.6
percent of GDP last year, even though revenue generated was
better than expected, while two salary increases “raised
employment costs by 22 percent, crowding out social and capital
investment,” it said.  The IMF said the effect of the salary increases was
worsened “in early 2012 by an increase in employee allowances
and unbudgeted recruitment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
