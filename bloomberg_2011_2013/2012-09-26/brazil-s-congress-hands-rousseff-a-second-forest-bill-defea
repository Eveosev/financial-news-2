Brazil ’s Congress yesterday
concluded voting on a decree to revamp the country’s forest
code, handing President  Dilma Rousseff  a second defeat on her
plan to limit deforestation.  The president’s decree signed May 25 required that cleared
areas bordering rivers wider than 10 meters be replanted out to 
20 meters on each bank. Lawmakers reduced that distance to 15 
meters. On larger tracts, the protection was lowered from 30 
meters to 20 meters. Lawmakers have also authorized the use of 
fruit trees for replanting.   “The president has repeatedly showed that the government
is only committed to the original version of the decree,”
Senator Eduardo Braga, leader of the government coalition in the
Senate, said. “The possibility of another veto is real,” he
told reporters in Brasilia.  Rousseff had previously vetoed 12 items from a bill
approved by Congress in April to replace the country’s 1965
forest legislation. The rejected articles reduced the area that
farmers were required to preserve. Instead of the vetoed rules,
Rousseff signed a decree that withdraws fines charged for
illegal deforestation as long as farmers agree to replant a
portion of the area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
