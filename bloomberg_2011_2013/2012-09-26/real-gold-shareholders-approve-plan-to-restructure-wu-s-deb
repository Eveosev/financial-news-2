Real Gold Mining Ltd. (246) , suspended
from Hong Kong trading since May last year following a report
about accounting irregularities, said 84 percent of its public
shareholders approved an agreement to restructure debt owed to
it by its largest stakeholder.  Wu Ruilin, who controls 41.2  percent  of the gold producer
with associates, abstained from voting at an extraordinary
general meeting today, Real Gold said in a statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange.  The Inner Mongolia-based company said in June the HK$794
million ($102 million) owed by Wu will be taken over by two
British Virgin Islands-based companies, Quanmin Investments Ltd.
and Victory Gold Management Inc., which will receive stakes in
Real Gold in return. Wu’s stake will fall to 15.4 percent after
the restructuring.  Real Gold was suspended from trading after the  South China
Morning Post  reported that the company may have filed two
different sets of accounts. Real Gold is required to conduct an
independent forensic-accounting investigation and publish all
outstanding results before it can resume trading, the  Hong Kong 
stock exchange said in a letter to the company in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
