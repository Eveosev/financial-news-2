Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator, said some of its Verismo single-
serving coffee brewers have sold out after initial sales topped
company forecasts.  “It’s really exceeded our expectations,” Alisa Martinez,
a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Starbucks, said in an interview.
“Some of the machines are on back order and they should be in
today.”  Starbucks last week began selling the latte-making machine
in a challenge to  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ’s Keurig
brand. The Verismo 580 model is priced at $199 on the Starbucks
store website.  Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM)  also sells Verismo brewers.  Starbucks won’t have trouble getting enough Verismo
inventory for the holiday season, Martinez said.  “We have a good understanding of the demand that we’re
going to be seeing,” she said. The Verismo will be available in
about 65 percent of Starbucks’s U.S. cafes beginning Oct. 16.  The shares  fell  0.8 percent to $50.10 at the close in New
York. Starbucks has gained 8.9 percent this year.  Green Mountain  dropped 1.5 percent to $23.52 and has lost
48 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
