Thailand’s baht fell to a one-week
low after exports dropped more than economists forecast amid
concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening.  Government bonds  were
little changed.  Shipments from Thailand decreased 7 percent in August,
compared with the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a
5.8 percent decline and a 4.5 percent slump in July, official
data showed yesterday. The  MSCI (MXAP)  Asia Pacific Index of shares
dropped as Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  faces calls for
early elections, which may spur a constitutional crisis in the
midst of a recession.  “Europe’s problems are still lingering in the market,
weighing on stocks and emerging-market currencies,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc.
in Tokyo. “Appreciation pressure on the baht from the export
side is much less now.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 30.99 per dollar as of 8:54
a.m. in Bangkok and reached 31 earlier, the weakest level since
Sept. 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
has strengthened 2.4 percent this quarter. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, dropped 47 basis points, or 0.47 percentage point, to
3.80 percent.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due May 2015 was
steady at 3.19 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
