Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, and  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  may have to wait until
March for word on whether their experimental blood thinner
Eliquis passes U.S. regulatory scrutiny.  The pill was rejected by the Food and Drug Administration
in June after the agency said it needed more information from
the companies’ existing trials. The two New York-based companies
said in a statement today they had given the FDA all the data
requested and were assigned a target decision date of March 17.  Revenue from Eliquis has the potential to peak at $4.7
billion if approved,  Catherine Arnold , an analyst with Credit
Suisse Group AG in New York, estimated in a note this month. The
pill, which could replace the drug Warfarin as the standard of
care, would also help make up for sales that the companies have
lost from their own top-selling blockbusters.  Pfizer’s Lipitor and Bristol-Myers’s Plavix lost patent
protection within the past 12 months and now face generic
competition.  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , based in  New Brunswick , New Jersey, and
Leverkusen, Germany-based  Bayer AG (BAYN)  have a competing pill
Xarelto, as does Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, of Ingelheim,
Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
