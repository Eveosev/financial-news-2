German 10-year bunds stayed higher
even as the nation got bids that fell short of its maximum sales
target at an auction of 10-year bonds.  The 10-year rate was five basis points lower at 1.53
percent as of 10:39 a.m. London time.  Germany  received bids for 3.95 billion euros at the sale,
less than the 5 billion-euro goal. The auction drew an average
yield of 1.52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
