Dusty Baker  may return for the
 Cincinnati Reds ’ final regular-season series after suffering a
mini-stroke while in the hospital last week.  The 63-year-old Baker had the stroke Sept. 21 as he was
being discharged from  Chicago ’s Northwestern Memorial Hospital.
He had been hospitalized three days earlier with an irregular
heartbeat and was absent when the Reds clinched a Major League
Baseball postseason spot.  His cardiologist and neurologist “are going to make sure
I’m ready to handle the duties of managing before I return full
time,” Baker said in a statement yesterday on the National
League team’s website. “I’m feeling much better and it’s great
being back here in Cincinnati.”  Pitcher Bronson Arroyo said it was fortunate that Baker was
still in the hospital when the stroke occurred.  “If the same events would have occurred and maybe we were
on the plane, then it would have been a lot worse,” Arroyo said.
“We’re going to have him back, which is nice to know.”  Bench coach Chris Speier is in charge of the team while
Baker, who managed his 3,000th career game last week, recovers.  The Reds’ final regular-season series against the  St. Louis
Cardinals  is scheduled for Oct. 1-3.  The Reds last night beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-2 to
improve to 93-61 for the season. Cincinnati leads the NL central
by 9 1/2 games over the Cardinals, who beat the Houston Astros
4-0 last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
