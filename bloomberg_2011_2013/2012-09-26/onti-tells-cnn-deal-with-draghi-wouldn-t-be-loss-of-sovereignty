Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said his country would retain independent political authority
even if it gets aid under European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-buying program, according to a CNN interview.  “I hope therefore that, number one, we will not need to
ask for the use of that instrument,” Monti said late yesterday
in a  televised interview  in New York. “But secondly, if we had
to, that is devised in such a way that it would not amount to a
surrender of sovereignty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
