South African  government bonds  may
attract as much as $8 billion in foreign investment because of
their inclusion in  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s World Government Bond Index
on Oct. 1, the U.S. bank said.  The bonds will become the fifth emerging-market country’s
debt to be listed on the 23-member index when added from the
close of trade on Sept. 28. The debt will have an index
weighting of about 0.45 percent, the bank’s Sub-Sahara Africa
Strategist  Leon Myburgh  said at a media briefing in Johannesburg
today. South African government bonds have an average yield of
6.63 percent, the highest on the gauge.  Citigroup said on April 17 that the country may be eligible
for inclusion. Less than $1 billion of the about  $6.5 billion  in
net foreign inflows to sovereign debt since then is probably
attributable to the announcement, Myburgh said, and as much as
$7 billion may follow. Inflows to other  emerging markets 
including Poland and Brazil have also been strong, he said.  “It’s a very important milestone for South Africa; a vote
of confidence,” Citigroup Country Officer for South Africa
Donna Oosthuyse said. “It’s good for the index as well as it
allows us, the sponsor, to diversify. Yields on South African
bonds are relatively high so they are attractive for
investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
