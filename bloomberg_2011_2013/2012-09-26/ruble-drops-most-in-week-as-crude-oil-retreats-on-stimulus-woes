The ruble dropped the most in
almost a week as crude,  Russia ’s biggest export earner,
retreated on concern new U.S. stimulus measures won’t shore up
economic growth.  The ruble weakened as much as 1.1 percent, the most on an
intraday basis since Sept. 20, and traded down 0.9 percent at
31.2374 versus the dollar as of 10:14 a.m. in Moscow. The
currency lost 0.2 percent versus the euro to 40.1860 and sank
0.5 percent against the central bank’s target euro-dollar
basket.  Crude in  New York  retreated after a report showed rising
U.S. stockpiles and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
President  Charles Plosser  said a new stimulus plan probably
won’t boost economic growth. Oil and natural gas contribute
about 50 percent of Russian government revenue.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.6865 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose four basis points to 214,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
three basis points to 7.610 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
