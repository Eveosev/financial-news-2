French jobless claims rose to more
than 3 million for the first time since June 1999 as companies
slashed jobs in the face of a stalled economy.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
23,900, or 0.8 percent, to 3.01 million, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Economists expected
an increase of 30,000, according to the median of five forecasts
gathered by  Bloomberg News .  With an economy that has failed to expand for three
consecutive quarters, French companies including  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG)  and Air France-KLM Group are cutting thousands from
their payrolls.  “Business managers continue to report staff cuts and this
movement appears to be accelerating,” said Pierre-Olivier
Beffy, chief economist at Exane BNP Paribas, before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
