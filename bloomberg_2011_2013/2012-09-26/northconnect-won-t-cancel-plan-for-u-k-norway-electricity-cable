NorthConnect , which plans a power
link between the U.K. and  Norway , may proceed with the project
after a proposed amendment to a law banning cables majority
owned by private companies.  All cross-border power cables from Norway should remain
under state ownership, the government said in a public
consultation call for a proposal to amend the energy act, posted
on the  ministry website  Sept. 18.  “We think that the proposed law amendment leaves room for
private owners, and want to have a closer look at the
possibilities on offer,” Tommy Loevstad, communication manager
for NorthConnect, said by e-mail from Kristiansand, Norway.
“The ministry initiative to maintain cross-border power cables
under state ownership is surprising, especially since U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  and his Norwegian counterpart Jens
Stoltenberg recently emphasized the high priority linking the
countries with interconnectors,” he said.  NorthConnect’s plan includes a 1,400 megawatt cable
operating by 2020, according to the company’s website. It is
jointly owned by Vattenfall AB, Scottish and Southern Energy
Plc, E-CO Energi AS, Agder Energi AS and Lyse Energi AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
