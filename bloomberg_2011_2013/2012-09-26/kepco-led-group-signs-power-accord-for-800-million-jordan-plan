A group led by  Korea Electric Power
Corp. (KEP)  signed a 25-year agreement with Jordan’s National Electric
Power Co. to sell electricity from an $800 million diesel-fired
plant being built in eastern Amman, the capital of the Middle
Eastern country.  The group, which includes  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and  Finland ’s
Wartsila Development & Financial Services, is building the 600-
megawatt power plant that is scheduled to start in February
2014, Tokyo-based Mitsubishi said in a  statement  today.  Jordan is opening up its  electricity market  to investors to
reduce power shortages and meet annual demand growth of as much
as 10 percent. Mitsubishi controls about 4,500 megawatts of
generation capacity globally and plans to boost that to 6,000
megawatts by 2015, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
