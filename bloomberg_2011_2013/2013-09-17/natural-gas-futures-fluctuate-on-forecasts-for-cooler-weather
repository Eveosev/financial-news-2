Department’s Energy Information Administration that may show
stockpiles rose by 59 billion cubic feet in the week ended Sept.
13, compared with the five-year average gain of 74 billion,

injection and that’s been supportive for prices,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market continues to try to push
higher.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 0.7 cent to $3.745
