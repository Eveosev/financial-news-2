Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, said it incorrectly charged customers
interest on personal loans after making errors in statements and
letters to clients.  The bank may have to pay as much as 100 million pounds
($159 million) to 300,000 customers to remedy the mistakes,
which date back as far as 2008, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because
the matter is private.  “Due to these notification errors, interest was not due on
certain accounts during the period that Barclays made this
mistake, and while no one has been mis-sold to, customers are
entitled to have their interest payments returned,” the London-based lender said in a statement today. “Barclays is
undertaking a review of all its businesses where similar issues
could arise to assess any related issues.”  Barclays, which made the disclosure in its prospectus
yesterday, said it has already made provisions for the costs.
The lender is seeking to raise 5.8 billion pounds this month to
bolster capital in the biggest rights offering by a U.K. bank
since  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s 13.5 billion-pound sale in
2009.  The Times of  London  reported the incorrect charges late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
