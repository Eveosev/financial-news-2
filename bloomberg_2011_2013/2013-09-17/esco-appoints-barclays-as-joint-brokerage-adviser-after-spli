Tesco Plc (TSCO) , the U.K.’s largest
grocer, said it appointed Barclays as joint corporate brokerage
adviser alongside Deutsche Bank AG.  The retailer confirmed the appointment after the Financial
Times reported earlier that Tesco has split with long-term
advisers Nomura and  JPMorgan Cazenove .  “In line with good practice and in common with other
listed companies, we carry out periodic reviews of all our
advisory service providers,” the Cheshunt, England-based
retailer said in an e-mailed statement today. “As such, we can
confirm that Deutsche Bank remains our corporate broker and that
we have appointed Barclays to work alongside them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
