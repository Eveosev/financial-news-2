Alberta Premier Alison Redford said
she wants the federal government to provide clarity on new rules
that limit investment by state-owned enterprises in the nation’s
 oil sands .  Redford, speaking on a conference call from  Shanghai , said
she wants the government to clarify under what conditions it
would allow Chinese state-owned companies to make investments.
Harper last December said Canada would rule out further state-owned controlling investments in the oil sands other than in
“exceptional circumstances.”  Redford also said the Canadian rules don’t appear to be
inhibiting long-term investment from China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
