The U.K. government will review how
to stop mobile-phone companies levying excessive roaming charges
and prevent hidden price rises when annual contracts are
renewed, reflecting concern by ministers at the cost of living.  Consumer Affairs Minister Jo Swinson also announced today
that the government will examine how to help consumers spread
the bulk of costly annual bills into more manageable monthly
installments. Another review will focus on how to improve the
transparency and content of information presented to consumers
about their bills.  “I’ll be working with industry to review how we can help
consumers get the best deal on a number of unavoidable, everyday
expenses, which have previously been inflated with hidden or
unnecessary costs,” Swinson, who’s attending her Liberal
Democrat party’s conference in Glasgow,  Scotland , said in an e-mailed statement. “I very much hope that businesses will see
sense and change any unfair practices voluntarily. If they
don’t, I am committed to using regulation to ensure consumers
get the deals they deserve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
