U.S. farmers who were prevented
from planting by rain this year filed crop-insurance claims on
six times more land than last season, the government said.  Farmers filed claims on 8.213 million acres of grains,
oilseeds, cotton and sugar as of Sept. 1, according to revised
 estimates  released today by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
Farm Service Agency. That compares with 7.71 million acres at
the beginning of August and last year’s total of 1.239 million
acres. The FSA is set to update its data monthly through
January, with its next report on Oct. 16.  Parts of the Midwest, including top corn and soybean
growers Iowa and  Illinois , saw double the normal amount of rain
in April and May, when farmers usually sow crops, National
Weather Service data show. Farmers planted a total of 246.3
million acres enrolled in government programs, including failed
acreage, down from 250.76 million a year earlier, the FSA said.  “Some parts of the Corn Belt have been hit by weather
problems throughout the season,” said Kieran Walsh, a broker of
agricultural derivatives at Aurel BCG in Paris. “Delayed
plantings and the higher number make sense.”  Crop prices rallied today on the  Chicago  Board of Trade as
corn for delivery in December rose as much as 2.6 percent to
$4.685 a bushel and soybeans for delivery in November added as
much as 1.2 percent to $13.65 a bushel. Corn is still down 45
percent since reaching a record $8.49 a bushel last year as
drought slashed U.S. yields, while soybeans slumped 24 percent
from last year’s all-time high of $17.89 a bushel.  Corn Harvest  Crop-insurance claims covered 3.57 million acres of corn as
of Sept. 1, up from 3.41 million in August and from last year’s
total of 262,467 acres, the FSA said. The USDA said Sept. 12
farmers might harvest a record 13.843 billion bushels of the
grain, more than previously estimated, as yields recover from
last year’s drought.  Soybean claims were filed on 1.69 million acres, compared
with 1.62 million in August and 159,579 acres last year,
according to the report. The U.S. harvest may total 3.149
billion bushels, less than expected in August while still 4.4
percent more than last year.  Farmers filed crop-insurance claims on 1.98 million acres
of wheat, up from 1.74 million in August, while rice claims at
418,021 acres rose from 408,737 acres a month earlier, the FSA
said. Claims for upland cotton increased to 205,410 acres from
197,116 acres, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
