Boeing Co. (BA) ’s larger 787 Dreamliner
completed its maiden flight today, taking a step toward entering
commercial service in 2014 without the delays or drama that
marked the debut of the original model.  Aircraft ZB001 touched down at Boeing Field near downtown
 Seattle  at 4:18 p.m. local time after cruising for more than
five hours over the Pacific Northwest. The jet took off from
Paine Field in Everett,  Washington , next to the factory where it
was built.  The flight gave Chicago-based Boeing its first look at the
jet’s performance as the company gains confidence that it has
solved the assembly and design snags that left the initial 787
and a redesigned 747 jumbo jet years behind schedule. Chief
Executive Officer Jim McNerney is weighing a speedup in output
beyond a goal of building 10 Dreamliners a month by year’s end.  “The 747-8 and 787-8 were challenging programs, but we’re
applying what we learned through a disciplined management model
for development programs,” said Scott Fancher, vice president
and general manager of airplane development. “We’re starting to
reap the benefits on programs” such as the 787-9.  Engineers will assess data gathered from the flight to
guide them through testing of the 787-9. Today’s plane was flown
by Boeing pilots Mike Bryan and Randy Neville.  Boeing plans to hand over the first 787-9 to Air New
Zealand Ltd. by mid-2014, Doug Alder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mail. The planemaker plans to produce three dedicated
flight-test planes, and to include two jets configured as
production models in later trials, Alder said.  List Price  The 787-9 has a list price of $249.5 million and seats 250
to 290 people, 40 more than the 787-8. Boeing stretched the
wide-body plane’s composite fuselage by 20 feet (6 meters) to
206 feet in length and redesigned it to be more aerodynamic.  Boeing is extending the range to as much as 8,500 nautical
miles (15,750 kilometers), about 300 nautical miles more than
the 787-8. Boeing has garnered 936 Dreamliner orders by touting
the ability of the twin-engine plane to serve long-haul routes
without the expense of a jumbo jet.  The 787-9 is in “that sweet spot from the long-haul
perspective,” Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing’s
commercial aircraft business, said on a company webcast. The new
plane offers fuel savings of 20 percent and “maybe even a
little bit better than that” over comparably sized aircraft.  Boeing began factory work on the larger jet on a specific
day the company had set 2 1/2 years earlier after developing a
new system, Fancher said in an interview last month. The process
gives it closer control over every aspect of a plane’s
development, from isolating potential risks to pacing daily
work, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
