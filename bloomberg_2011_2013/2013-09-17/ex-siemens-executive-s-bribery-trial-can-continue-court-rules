The trial of former  Siemens AG (SIE) 
executive Uriel Sharef over whether he paid $8.4 million in
bribes continued after a Munich court delayed a ruling on
whether to drop the case.  Sharef, 69, is accused of paying bribes to former Argentine
officials who did deals with Siemens units in the 1990s in order
to win contracts. The court hasn’t ruled on requests from
Sharef’s lawyer to drop the case over claims prosecutors didn’t
submit a “truthful” account of their investigation.  The evidence prosecutors gave to the court against Sharef
remains “chaotic” and does not demonstrate that he was
responsible for any illegal payments, his lawyer, Heiko Lesch,
told the court today.  The Siemens corruption scandal that broke in 2006 triggered
investigations in at least a dozen countries. Siemens agreed to
pay $1.6 billion to settle probes in the U.S. and  Germany  in
2008.  The allegations in today’s case took place while Sharef was
on Siemens’s management board. He agreed to pay $275,000 in
April to settle a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over claims the company paid $27 million in bribes to
win contracts for identity cards.  The court may rule on Lesch’s request on Friday, said Hans-Kurt Hertel, the tribunal’s spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
