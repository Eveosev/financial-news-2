German consumers will pay more than
20 billion euros ($27 billion) a year to fund the nation’s
“Energiewende,” or shift to renewable power, regardless of the
outcome of elections, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The cost of subsidies for renewable energy has more than
doubled since 2010, to 20.4 billion euros in 2013, Anna Czajkowska, an analyst for clean  energy policy  at BNEF in
London, said today in e-mailed research note. Subsidies are
fixed for 20 years and even if a newly elected government
changes future support levels for  wind  and solar generation, the
bill will be more than 20 billion euros until 2030, she said.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is seeking a third term as
 Germany ’s leader in Sept. 22 elections. She has pledged to
reform support for renewable energy as priority grid access and
subsidies for solar and wind have sent wholesale power contracts
to record-low levels while boosting consumer costs.  “VAT and excise tax on power prices in Germany are among
the highest in  Europe  and their reduction could be a ‘quick win’
for the new ruling coalition,” Czajkowska said.  Next-year German power, a benchmark in Europe, declined to
36.02 euros a megawatt-hour on Aug. 30, the lowest since March
2005, according to data from European Energy Exchange AG. It was
trading at 39.40 euros a megawatt-hour at 12:44 p.m. Berlin
time, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
