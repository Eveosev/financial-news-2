Nigeria’s  inflation  rate dropped to
8.2 in August, the lowest level since April 2008, according to
the  National Bureau of Statistics .  Inflation in  Africa ’s top oil producer slowed from 8.7
percent in July, the Abuja-based statistics agency said today in
an e-mailed statement. The median estimate of nine economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 8.8 percent. Prices rose 0.3 percent
in the month, the statistics bureau said.  The inflation rate has stayed within the Central Bank of
Nigeria’s target of less than 10 percent this year, as the
effect of higher fuel prices in 2012 fell out of the calculation
and the central bank regularly sold dollars to support the
naira.  The central bank kept its  policy rate  at a record 12
percent for the 11th consecutive meeting in July to bolster the
currency, in a monetary stance central bank Governor Lamido
Sanusi has said is containing prices. The central bank forecasts
inflation will remain within its target corridor through
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
