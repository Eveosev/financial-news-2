Leap Wireless International Inc. (LEAP) ,
the prepaid wireless carrier that agreed to a $1.2 billion
takeover by  AT&T Inc. (T)  in July, will hold a meeting on Oct. 24
for investors to vote on the deal.  The meeting will be held at 8 a.m. in Denver, the company
said today in a filing. Leap also said it will have to pay a
termination fee of $46.3 million to $71.2 million, depending on
the circumstances, if the deal falls apart.  AT&T, the second-biggest U.S. wireless carrier, agreed to
buy Leap for $15 a share in cash, offering a premium of 88
percent over the stock price at the time. The transaction gives
Dallas-based AT&T more pay-as-you-go customers, along with
airwaves to improve its network.  Leap shares fell 0.3 percent to $15.56 at the close in  New
York . AT&T rose less than 1 percent to $34.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
