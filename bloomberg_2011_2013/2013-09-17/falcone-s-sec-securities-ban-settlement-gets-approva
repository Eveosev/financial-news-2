Billionaire hedge-fund manager
 Philip Falcone ’s $18 million settlement with U.S. regulators
that includes a five-year ban from the securities industry and
an admission of wrongdoing was accepted by a federal judge.  U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty in Manhattan today said
in a written order that the agreement reached last month with
Falcone and  Harbinger Capital  Partners LLC is “appropriate and
proportionate to the defendants’ admitted wrongful conduct.”  The SEC accused Falcone, who became a billionaire by
betting against the U.S. housing market in 2006, of improperly
borrowing money from his fund to pay his personal taxes and said
he gave preferential treatment to some of his investors in
returning their money. The regulator also accused Falcone of
engaging in a short squeeze of bonds held by a Canadian
manufacturer.  The bar from the securities industry will allow Falcone to
liquidate his  hedge funds  under the supervision of an
independent monitor, the SEC said last month. He and his firm
will pay an $18 million fine.  Eric Goldstein, a lawyer representing Harbinger Capital,
didn’t return a phone call or e-mail after regular business
hours seeking comment.  The case is SEC v. Philip A. Falcone, 12-cv-05027, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
