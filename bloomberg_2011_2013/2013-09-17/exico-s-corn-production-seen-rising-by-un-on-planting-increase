Corn production in  Mexico , the
world’s third biggest importer, may be 1.5 percent larger than
last year as planting expanded for the country’s main harvest,
the United Nations said.  Mexico, which harvests two corn crops a year, may produce a
total of 22.4 million metric tons of the grain in 2013, up from
22.069 million a year earlier, the UN’s Food & Agriculture
Organization said in an online  report  today. Farmers have just
finished planting the main crop, which accounts for about 70
percent of annual production. The secondary harvest, which was
finished in August, was about 4.8 million tons, 13 percent
smaller than in 2012 because of reduced water reserves.  Planting of the main crop “has just been completed under
generally favorable weather conditions,” the Rome-based FAO
said. The main harvest may be 17.6 million tons, 6 percent
larger than a year earlier, which “mainly reflects an increase
in the area planted and government support programs providing
input subsidies and credit facilities.”  Mexico’s main wheat harvest, which finished in July and
accounts for 90 percent of annual ouput, was about 3.7 million
tons, 13 percent more than in 2012, the FAO said. Total wheat
production was pegged at 3.75 million tons. The rice harvest at
178,000 tons was 4 percent smaller than last year because of
reduced planting.  Total imports of grain in the 2012-13 season that ends
Sept. 30 will be about 14 million tons, 19 percent less than a
year earlier, according to the report. Mexico’s corn imports
trail only  Japan  and South Korea as the world’s largest. The
country is the biggest buyer of rice and third largest importer
of wheat from the U.S., after Japan and Nigeria, according to
the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  To contact the reporter on this story:
