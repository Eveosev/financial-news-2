Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and a group
of other lenders agreed to settle a dispute with the liquidators
of the Bell Group over about A$265 million ($247 million) in
loans that they recovered after its 1991 collapse.  Liquidators won a A$1.66 billion award including compound
interest in 2009, and as part of the settlement, details of
which aren’t being disclosed, a final appeal by the banks will
be dropped, according to a joint statement today.  The consortium of 20 banks including  National Australia
Bank Ltd. (NAB) , Standard Chartered Plc and  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , took security over assets of the Bell Group in 1990,
a year before the company filed for bankruptcy. The liquidators
sued in 1995 claiming the banks assisted the directors to breach
their duties by agreeing to put up the security while knowing
the company was insolvent.  The case has been one of the longest-running and most
expensive in the country’s history, the West Australian
newspaper reported. Three former Federal Court judges were
assigned the appeal case because all other judges in the state
had been involved in the litigation, the newspaper said.  “Settling now is a pragmatic decision which will save
further time and costs for all parties,” John Vaughan, a lawyer
and spokesman for the banks at Herbert Smith Freehills, said in
today’s statement.  Bell Group was the company of Alan Bond, who had financed
 Australia ’s successful bid for the 1983 America’s Cup yachting
race.  In 1987, he purchased the Channel Nine television network
from Australian billionaire Kerry Packer for A$1 billion. Bond
declared bankruptcy in 1992, with personal debts of A$1.8
billion. Packer bought back the television channel for A$250
million.  The case is Westpac Banking Corp. v The Bell Group Ltd.
