FriendFinder Networks Inc., the
owner of Penthouse magazine and a sex-dating website, sought
 bankruptcy protection  in Delaware after reporting losses in
seven consecutive years to 2012.  The  Boca Raton , Florida-based company listed assets of less
than $10 million and liabilities of as much as $1 billion in
today’s Chapter 11 filing in Wilmington, Delaware.  The company hasn’t made a  profit  since at least 2006 and
reported a second-quarter net loss of $10.3 million, or 32 cents
a share, on Aug. 15. It had cash or equivalents of $38.6 million
on Mar. 31 compared with outstanding principal debt of $544
million, according to the financial statement.  FriendFinder was working with advisers and lenders to
refinance the long-term debt, Chief Executive Officer Anthony Previte said in the Aug. 15 statement. He said at the time he
was confident the debt issue would be resolved.  PMGI Holdings Inc. and 38 other affiliates also filed for
bankruptcy.  FriendFinder was delisted from  Nasdaq  on Aug. 7 and is
trading on the OTCQB Marketplace where shares rose 1 cent
yesterday to 33 cents.  The case is In re:  FriendFinder Networks Inc. (FFNT)  13-12405.
