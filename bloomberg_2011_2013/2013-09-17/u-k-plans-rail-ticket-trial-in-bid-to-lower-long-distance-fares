The U.K. government plans a trial
of a new system for long-distance rail tickets in a bid to end
situations where one-way fares can cost more than a round trip.  A pilot program to start in 2015 may see all long-distance
tickets sold on a single-leg basis, allowing passengers more
freedom to plan journeys, Rail Minister Norman Baker said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The government currently regulates the price of off-peak
round-trip fares, meaning train operating companies have greater
freedom to set prices for other tickets, including off-peak one-way fares. The Department for Transport will negotiate with a
long-distance operator to find a suitable route for the pilot
program.  “I am determined to end this confusing and frustrating
system in which the price of single fares for long-distance
journeys can be similar to those of returns,” said Baker, who’s
taking part in the annual conference of his Liberal Democrat
party in Glasgow,  Scotland . “Passengers need every confidence
that the journeys they are paying for are the best deals in
terms of convenience and money spent.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
