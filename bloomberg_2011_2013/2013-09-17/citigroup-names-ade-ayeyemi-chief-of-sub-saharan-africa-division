Citigroup Inc. (C) , the U.S. lender
with a presence in 16 African countries, appointed Ade Ayeyemi
as chief executive officer for sub-Saharan Africa.  Ayeyemi, who was head of transaction services in Africa,
has been with the bank for 25 years, the Johannesburg-based unit
of Citigroup said in an e-mailed statement today. Ayeyemi, who
worked for the bank in Nigeria before taking up regional roles,
will be based in Johannesburg.  Citigroup, which provides  project financing  and  investment
banking  in Africa, has been expanding on the continent to tap
economic growth that is outstripping rates in developed nations.
Africa represents an important growth opportunity for Citigroup
as the continent increases its share of world trade, Donna Oosthuyse, chief country officer for the New York-based bank in
South Africa, said yesterday.  “We believe that Africa will outpace that of many parts of
the world and expect that in time, Africa’s share of
contribution to the bank will also increase,” Oosthuyse said in
an e-mailed response to questions.  Citigroup’s North African business will be overseen by Atiq Ur Rehman, head of the lender’s  Middle East  unit, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
