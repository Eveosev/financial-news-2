The Cincinnati Bengals dropped the
Pittsburgh Steelers to 0-2 for the first time since 2002,
winning 20-10 as rookie Giovani Bernard scored two touchdowns to
cap Week 2 of the National Football League season.  A second-round pick in this year’s draft out of the
University of North Carolina, Bernard scored his first NFL
touchdown on a seven-yard run in the first quarter. He added a
27-yard reception for a score during the third quarter to snap a
10-10 tie last night in Cincinnati.  The Bengals evened their record at 1-1, outgaining the
Steelers 407 to 278 in total yards, while forcing two turnovers
and sacking Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger twice.  “We did what we needed to win this game,” said Bengals
quarterback Andy Dalton, who completed 25 of 45 passes for 280
yards and a touchdown. “We beat a great opponent and nothing
better than to do it on Monday night.”  Derek Moye scored the lone touchdown on a 1-yard pass for
the Steelers, who were held to 44 yards rushing and are among
eight winless teams in the NFL through the first two weeks of
the season.  Pittsburgh last started a season with two straight losses
in 2002 before finishing 10-5-1. In the four times the Steelers
have started 0-2 in the past 25 years, they’ve recovered to post
a winning record each time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
