South Korea will increase financial
and tax support for small- and medium-sized companies to help
them cope with headwinds from slower growth in  China  and a weak
yen.  The government will make available an additional 5.3
trillion won ($4.9 billion) in low-interest loans this year
through policy banks such as Korea Development Bank to spur
investment in facilities, the Finance Ministry said in a
statement today. Tax support to shorten the time that companies
can recoup their investments will also be offered.  The measures come as President Park Geun Hye tries to meet
a 2.7 percent growth target for 2013 as a 23 percent decline in
the yen against the won over the past year and a slowdown in
China weigh on demand for South Korean exports. The government
introduced a 17.3 trillion won extra budget in May and the 
central bank cut interest rates as record household debt and a
sluggish housing market restrain consumption.  The recovery in the private sector “remains weak,”
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said in  Seoul . “We will
strengthen policy measures so that the recent recovery momentum
can be passed on to the private sector and spur corporate
investment.”  Hyun said more measures to spur investment are planned at
the end of this month.  China’s economy will expand 7.5 percent this year, the
slowest pace since 1990, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
