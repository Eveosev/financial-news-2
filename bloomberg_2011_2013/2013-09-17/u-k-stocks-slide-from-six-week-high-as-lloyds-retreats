U.K. stocks  declined the most this
month as lenders fell after the government sold a stake in
Lloyds Banking Group Plc and Glencore Xstrata Plc led mining
companies lower.  Lloyds tumbled the most since May 23 after UK Financial
Investments Ltd. sold a 6 percent stake in the company on behalf
of the government. Glencore slid 2.3 percent as UBS AG cut its
rating for the commodity producer.  Aviva Plc (AV/)  and Aggreko Plc
retreated after analysts advised selling the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  dropped 52.69 points, or 0.8 percent, to
6,570.17 in London, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s
two-day meeting starting today for its stance on reducing bond
purchases. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also declined 0.8
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.1 percent.  “The market is really focused on what the Fed is going to
tell us tomorrow -- how much they’ll taper, whether they’ll
taper.” David Wartenweiler, chief investment officer at Habib
Bank AG, said by telephone from Zurich. “A lot of it is priced
in. If they don’t taper, that would be a surprise. I’m not sure
it’d be positive for equities, because it would imply the Fed is
concerned about the U.S. economy.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the FTSE 100 was 80 percent higher than the average of the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stimulus Policy  The Federal Open Market Committee will probably decide to
reduce its monthly bond purchases by $10 billion to $75 billion,
according to the median estimate of 34 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey earlier this month. That’s down from the forecast of
a $20 billion reduction in a July survey. The FOMC will announce
its decision after European market hours tomorrow.  In the U.K., the Bank of England will publish the minutes
of its recent policy meeting at 9:30 a.m. in  London  tomorrow.  Lloyds lost 3.5 percent to 74.65 pence. UKFI, which
overseas the government’s holding in the bank, sold 4.28 billion
shares for 3.2 billion pounds ($5.1 billion). The shares were
priced at 75 pence, a 3.1 percent discount to yesterday’s
closing price and above the 73.6 pence the state originally paid
after providing a 20 billion-pound bailout in 2008.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , which received a 45.5
billion-pound bailout, fell 1.1 percent to 362.5 pence.  Commodity Producers  Glencore slid 2.3 percent to 334.2 pence, contributing the
most to the decline in a gauge of  U.K. mining companies . UBS cut
the company’s rating to neutral from buy, citing a high
valuation amid a challenging outlook for copper and coal prices.
The stock trades at 17.9 times its projected earnings, compared
with 9 at the end of March.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  retreated 2.1 percent to 1,158 pence.  Evraz Plc (EVR)  retreated 1.6 percent to 137.7 pence. Barclays
Plc downgraded the mining-and-metals company to underweight from
equal weight, saying investors are concerned about a lack of
free cash flow, high levels of borrowing and exposure to the
long-steel market in  Russia . Citigroup Inc. also reduced its
 recommendation  to neutral from buy.  Aviva lost 1.1 percent to 415.1 pence. Berenberg Bank cut
the U.K.’s third-biggest insurer by market value to sell from
hold. Mediobanca SpA started coverage of the company with an
underperform rating, saying the company’s return on equity may
slide, partly because of high levels of borrowing.  Aggreko lost 4.2 percent to 1,580 pence. Credit Suisse
Group AG downgraded the largest provider of mobile power
generators to underperform, the equivalent of sell, from
neutral. Credit Suisse also cut  Aggreko (AGK) ’s earnings estimates by
6 percent for 2013, 19 percent for 2014 and 16 percent for 2015,
citing challenging trading conditions in the company’s power-projects division.  Porvair Plc rallied 5.2 percent to 244 pence. The
filtration and environmental-technology company said revenue in
the nine months ended Aug. 31 increased 13 percent from the same
period last year and it expects pretax profit for the full year
to exceed its own forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
