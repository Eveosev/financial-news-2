National Bank of Canada , the
nation’s sixth-largest lender by assets, closed its
institutional equities office in Geneva.  “The decision was made following a periodic review of our
activities,” Claude Breton, a spokesman for the Montreal-based
company, said today in an e-mailed statement. The closing, which
happened yesterday, resulted in the dismissals of 10 employees
at the lender’s investment-banking unit, National Bank
Financial, Breton said.  “The bank remains firmly committed to the ongoing
development of its European business, most notably through our
London office with institutional client trading and corporate
financing and in Paris for banking activities,” he said.  The Globe and Mail’s Streetwise blog reported on the
closing earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
