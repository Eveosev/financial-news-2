Google Inc. (GOOG) , owner of the world’s
largest search engine, agreed to buy the entire output of a 240-megawatt wind farm in Texas, its largest renewable-power
purchase.  Google will purchase the electricity from the Happy
Hereford wind farm outside of Amarillo, Texas, from developer
Chermac Energy Corp. once it’s completed in late 2014, the
Mountain View, California-based company said today in a
 statement  on its blog.  Power from the project will feed into the Southwest Power
Pool regional grid and go to Google’s data center in Mayes
County, Oklahoma. The length of the contract and financial
details weren’t disclosed.  The purchase represents more than a third of the 570
megawatts of renewable energy capacity the company has
contracted to buy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
