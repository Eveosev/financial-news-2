Fidelity Investments named John Roth co-manager of its $23.5 billion  Fidelity Advisor New
Insights Fund (FNIAX) , joining Will Danoff, who has run the fund since
it was created in 2003.  Roth will continue to co-manage two other funds, the $2.5
billion  Fidelity New Millennium Fund (FMILX)  and the $7.7 billion
Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund, the Boston-based money management
firm said in an e-mailed statement today. Both funds beat 89
percent of peers over the past five years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Danoff is best known as manager of the $98.4 billion
 Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) , Fidelity’s largest stock fund. Since he
took over the fund 23 years ago, it has returned about 13
percent a year, compared with 9.8 percent for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  Contrafund and the New Insights Fund share many of the same
top holdings including Mountain view, California-based Google
Inc. and Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Fidelity
manages $1.8 trillion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
