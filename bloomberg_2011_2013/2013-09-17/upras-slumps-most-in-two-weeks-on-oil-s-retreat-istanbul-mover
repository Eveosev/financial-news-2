Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri
AS (TUPRS) , Turkey’s sole oil refiner, headed for the biggest decline in
two weeks as crude prices slipped after the possibility of a
military strike against Syria waned.  Tupras  shares  fell 2.5 percent, poised for the biggest drop
since Sept. 3, to 42.40 liras at the 3:09 p.m. in Istanbul,
paring this month’s advance to 5.5 percent. Almost 1.1 million
shares traded, about 1.4 times the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa Istanbul
National 100 (XU100)  Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 74,290.12.  Brent crude futures fell for a second day following a
weekend agreement between the U.S. and  Russia  on disarming
Syria’s chemical weapons that eased the threat of an imminent
military strike. The commodity is down 6.1 percent from a seven-month high of $116.61 on Aug. 28.  Syria ’s border with  Iraq  puts
the country as near as 240 kilometers (150 miles) to almost a
fifth of the production capacity of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Oil’s decline won’t affect refinery margins in the short
run, but investors think it may hurt inventories,” Erdem Kayli,
an analyst at Ata Invest in Istanbul, said by phone. “Tupras is
negatively affected from oil price volatility that comes with
rising regional tension.”  Kocaeli, Turkey-based Tupras reported second-quarter net
income of 137.6 million liras ($69 million), up 1.4 percent from
the same period last year. The refiner’s net margin dropped 28
percent to $2.63 per barrel, according to an investor
presentation on its  website .  Tupras trades at 10.1 times estimated 12-month earnings,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a multiple
of 14 for Poland’s PKN Orlen SA and 11.3 for Israel’s  Paz Oil
Co. (PZOL)  Three analysts recommend buying shares of Tupras, while 23,
including Ata Invest’s Kayli, say hold and seven recommend
selling, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
