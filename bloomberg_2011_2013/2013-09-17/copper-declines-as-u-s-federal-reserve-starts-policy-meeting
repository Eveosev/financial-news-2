Copper dropped as the  Federal
Reserve  begins a two-day policy meeting at which it is forecast
to reduce the pace of its U.S. bond buying.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $7,039.50 a metric ton
and was at $7,052 by 10:16 a.m. in Tokyo. The metal lost 1.7
percent last week.  The Fed meets today and tomorrow to consider whether to
taper its $85 billion-a-month in bond buying. Purchases will
probably be cut by $10 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey
of economists. Former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers ’ exit
from the Fed chairman race fueled speculation the central bank
will take a more gradual approach to taper stimulus.  “Investors were reluctant to take new positions ahead of
the Fed meeting,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief fund manager at
Astmax Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo. “Overall sentiment
remained subdued.”  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.3 percent to 51,010  yuan  ($8,335) a ton. Metal
for delivery in December sank 0.5 percent to $3.205 a pound on
the Comex in New York.  On the LME, zinc and nickel also dropped, while aluminum
and lead were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
