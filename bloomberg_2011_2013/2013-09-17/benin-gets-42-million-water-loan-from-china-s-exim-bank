The Export-Import Bank of China
will lend Benin $42 million to finance the supply of drinking
water in 69 villages in the West African country, Energy and
Water Minister Barthelemy Kassa said.  The loan means the country will be able to supply drinking
water to 67 percent of the population, as required by the
Millennium Development Goals, he told lawmakers yesterday in
Porto-Novo, the political capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
