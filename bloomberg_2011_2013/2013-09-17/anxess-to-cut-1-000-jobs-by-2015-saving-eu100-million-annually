Lanxess AG (LXS) , the synthetic rubber
maker that joined  Germany ’s benchmark DAX index a year ago, said
it will cut 1,000 jobs and also management bonuses to save about
100 million euros ($134 million) annually from 2015.  The savings program will cost 150 million euros in one-time
charges that will be booked in 2013 and 2014, the Cologne-based
company said in a statement late yesterday. Lanxess said it will explore
strategic options for units with about 500 million euros in
combined sales and 1,000 workers, that are considered peripheral
activities.  Chief Executive Officer Axel Heitmann said in August that
he would review company strategy after orders slumped and he had
to abandon a 2014 profit forecast. Lanxess, which generates
about 40 percent of sales from the auto and tire industries, has
suffered as European car sales faltered, with August deliveries
at the lowest since records began in 1990.  “Lanxess is countering the challenging business
environment with a comprehensive efficiency program,” the
company said in today’s statement. “Currently, it is foremost
the synthetic rubber activities that are experiencing a
temporary weakness in demand, increased competition in the
market and volatile raw-materials prices.”  Bonuses for this year will be cut for those eligible,
including the management board, Lanxess said today. The job cuts
will be achieved with the help of early retirement packages and
severance pay.  In an effort to reduce the company’s dependence on rubber,
Lanxess will target acquisitions in the mid to long-term that
will strengthen its chemicals units, it said today.  Lanxess shares have dropped 22 percent this year, making
them the second-worst performer on the DAX index after potash
maker  K+S AG. (SDF)  The stock closed down 1.1 percent at 51.40
euros yesterday.  The synthetic rubber maker stuck to a full-year target of
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and
exceptional items of 700 million euros to 800 million euros. The
forecast excludes potential inventory devaluations, Lanxess
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
