Chicago gasoline and diesel
strengthened against futures on plans for  Marathon Petroleum
Corp. (MPC)  to shut units at its  Kentucky  refinery.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  gained 0.75 cent to 3.25 cents
above futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:39 p.m.,
the  strongest level  since June 14. Conventional, 85-octane
gasoline, or CBOB, moved to a 5-cent-a-gallon premium to futures
from a 3-cent discount Sept. 13.  Two state filings showed that Marathon’s Catlettsburg,
Kentucky, refinery was scheduled to shut a distillate
desulfurization unit today, a hydrogen system tomorrow and a
crude unit and several others on Sept. 23. A fluid catalytic
cracker was expected to shut Sept. 15 for 45 days of work, a
person familiar with the refinery’s operations said last week.  Jamal Kheiry, a spokesman for Marathon in Findlay,  Ohio ,
declined to comment on the maintenance plans.  The Catlettsburg refinery , in northeastern Kentucky on the
Big Sandy River, has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day. The
plant processes a wide range of both sweet and sour crude oils
and distributes products by pipeline, barge, truck and rail,
according to Marathon’s website.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate oil in
Cushing, Oklahoma, dropped 57 cents to $12.01 a barrel, a third
consecutive decline and lowest level since February 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
