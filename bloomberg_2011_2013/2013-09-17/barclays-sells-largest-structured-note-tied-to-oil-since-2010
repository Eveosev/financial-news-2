Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, sold $103.4 million of one-year U.S.
notes tied to Brent crude oil futures, the largest such offering
since at least January 2010.  The securities, issued Sept. 12, yield a maximum of 15
percent with protection against 15 percent of losses and all
capital at risk, according to a prospectus filed with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank distributed the
note for a 1 percent fee.  Barclays has sold $230 million of notes tied to oil this
year in 18 offerings, more than any other issuer, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mark Lane , a spokesman for the bank in  New York , declined
to comment on the securities.  Barclays estimated the notes’ initial value at 98.59 cents
on the dollar, according to the prospectus.  Front-month Brent futures fell 3 percent this year,
settling at $107.80 a barrel today on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange.  The lender sold $24.1 million of one-year notes tied to
West Texas Intermediate crude on July 17, its next-largest oil
offering this year. The securities yield the absolute value of
changes in the price of West Texas Intermediate crude to a
maximum of 21.5 percent of declines and unlimited gains,
according to a prospectus filed with the SEC.  Bloomberg started collecting comprehensive data on
structured notes in 2010.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in  interest rates  or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
