Sydney will lead a jump in
Australian  home prices , which will soar as much as 20 percent in
2014, as demand driven by record-low interest rates meets a lack
of supply, according to  SQM Research Pty.   Prices across  Australia ’s major cities could rise as much
as 11 percent on average in 2014 in SQM’s base-case scenario,
which assumes no more than one 25 basis-point  interest-rate cut 
by the central bank, the Sydney-based property researcher said
in its Housing Boom and Bust Report. All of Australia’s major
cities will see increases, except Canberra, which is expected to
record declines of as much as 4 percent, it said.  “The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will be placed in a
difficult position with regard to interest rate settings
sometime between the second and third quarters of 2014,” Louis
Christopher, managing director at SQM, said in the report.
“Would they lift rates if it was just a few cities experiencing
growth beyond 7 percent? Would they lift rates if unemployment
was still rising?”  The RBA, which has lowered borrowing costs by 2.25
percentage points since late 2011 to 2.5 percent, today said it
retains the option of reducing  interest rates , while adding the
effect of earlier cuts hasn’t fully materialized yet. Sydney,
where dwelling  prices  have jumped 8.3 percent so far this year,
recorded an auction clearance rate of 84.3 percent last weekend,
figures from researcher RP Data show.  High, Low  SQM forecasts an increase of as much as 8 percent in Perth,
7 percent in Melbourne and Brisbane and 6 percent in Adelaide,
Hobart and Darwin in 2014.  In SQM’s best-case scenario, which assumes a strong
economic recovery and interest-rate increases in mid-2014 or
earlier, prices across Australia’s major cities could surge as
much as 18 percent on average in 2014, led by price growth as
high as 30 percent in Sydney, as much as 15 percent in Perth, 12
percent in Brisbane and 11 percent in  Melbourne .  In its worst-case scenario, which assumes a crash in
Australia’s terms of trade, rate cuts of at least 100 basis
points and a local currency below 80 U.S. cents, SQM forecasts
prices will still rise by between 4 percent and 7 percent, with
Sydney recording increases of as much as 15 percent. Only Perth,
Darwin and Canberra will probably see declines under that
scenario, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
