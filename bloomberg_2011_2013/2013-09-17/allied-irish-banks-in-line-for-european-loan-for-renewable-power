Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  is in line
for a 100 million-euro ($134 million) loan from  Europe  to
finance renewable projects as Ireland promotes clean power.  The  European Investment Bank  is studying the loan for the
Dublin-based bank to finance small-scale onshore wind, biomass,
hydro and solar plants, the EIB said on its website. The
projects will cost about 200 million euros in total.  Ireland is boosting renewable plants such as wind on land
and at sea to add jobs and spur the economy by exporting the
power to the U.K. and northwest Europe. It has a goal to get 16
percent of all energy from renewable sources by 2020, from 6.5
percent in 2011. The loan requires EIB board approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
