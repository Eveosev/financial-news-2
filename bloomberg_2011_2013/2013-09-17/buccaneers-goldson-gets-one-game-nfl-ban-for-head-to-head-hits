Safety Dashon Goldson of the  Tampa
Bay Buccaneers  was suspended without pay by the  National
Football League  for this week’s game against the  New England
Patriots  for repeated illegal hits.  Goldson received an unnecessary roughness penalty for a
helmet-to-helmet hit with a defenseless receiver during the
second quarter of the Buccaneers’ 16-14 loss to the  New Orleans
Saints  two days ago. It was the second straight week and the
fifth time since 2011 that Goldson was flagged for an illegal
hit to the head and neck area of a defenseless player.  Goldson was fined $30,000 by the NFL last week for striking
New York Jets tight end Jeff Cumberland in the head and neck
area during the Buccaneers’ Week 1 loss.  NFL Vice President of Football Operations Merton Hanks said
Goldson was suspended because he lowered his head and
“unnecessarily rammed” the left side of his helmet into the
head of Saints running back Darren Sproles.  “You delivered a forceful blow with your helmet and made
no attempt whatsoever to wrap up your opponent or make a
conventional tackle on the play,” Hanks wrote to Goldson in a
letter informing him of the ban. “This illegal contact clearly
could have been avoided.”  Goldson, 28, has 16 tackles in his first two games with the
Buccaneers, who signed the two-time Pro Bowl player to a five-year contract during the offseason that the Tampa Bay Tribune
said is worth $41 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
