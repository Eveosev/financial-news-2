Ibovespa  futures  dropped after
foreign investment into  China ,  Brazil ’s main trading partner,
trailed forecasts.  Toll road operator  CCR SA (CCRO3)  may be active after its unit
Viaoeste named Eduardo Siqueira Moraes Camargo chief executive
officer. Crude producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA may move after
saying it found oil in Brazil’s Potiguar basin.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in October slipped 0.3
percent to 52,730 at 9:17 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real climbed
0.4 percent to 2.2755 per dollar. Stocks in China fell after a
report showed foreign-direct investment increased 0.6 percent
last month, compared with a median forecast of 12.5 percent
growth among economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., the Federal Reserve will probably lower its
$85 billion of monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, according
to the median response of 34 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News earlier this month. That’s down from the forecast of a $20
billion reduction in a July survey. The FOMC starts its two-day
meeting today.  The Ibovespa entered a bull market on Sept. 9 after rising
20 percent from this year’s low on July 3 through that day. The
gauge is still down 21 percent in dollar terms this year,
compared with a decline of 5.2 percent for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume of stocks in Sao Paulo was 9.36 billion
reais yesterday, compared with a daily average of 7.74 billion
reais this year through Sept. 13, according to data compiled by
