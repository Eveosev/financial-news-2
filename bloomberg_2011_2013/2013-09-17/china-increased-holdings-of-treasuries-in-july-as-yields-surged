China , the largest foreign lender
to America, increased its holdings of Treasuries in July as
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will slow purchases pushed U.S.
bond yields to the highest level in two years.  China’s stake increased by $1.5 billion in July, or 0.1
percent, to $1.277 trillion, after declining the prior month,
according to Treasury Department data released yesterday.
Treasuries held by  Japanese investors , who have the second
largest stake in  U.S. government debt , rose to a record.  The growth of China’s holdings comes as  overseas holdings 
of Treasuries have grown $16.3 billion, or 0.3 percent, this
year, the slowest pace since a 2 percent decline in the first
seven months of 2006. Treasuries have lost 3.7 percent this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, headed
for the worst performance since 2009.  “If real rates back up enough, they come back and buy,”
said  William O’Donnell , head U.S. government-bond strategist at
Royal Bank of  Scotland ’s RBS Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“The magnitude of the back-up since early May is certainly
significant.”  Treasury Selloff  Yields climbed after July 5 when the Labor Department said
the U.S. added 195,000 jobs in June, compared with the 165,000
economists had forecast. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said June
19 that improving conditions might lead policy makers to reduce
the size of their $85 billion a month in purchases of Treasuries
and mortgage securities.  The benchmark 10-year  Treasury yield  rose nine basis points
or 0.09 percentage point, to 2.58 percent in July. It touched
3.005 percent Sept. 6, the highest since July 27, 2011.  Currency reserves have risen 5.6 percent through June to
$3.5 trillion, according to data from the People’s Bank of
China. Reserve growth in 2012 was 4.1 percent, the slowest pace
since 1998, the data show. Reserves had grown at a double-digit
pace for 11 consecutive years.  China’s  Treasury position  has risen $56.9 billion, or 4.7
percent, this year after a 5.9 percent increase in 2012. The
holdings declined 0.7 percent to $1.152 trillion in 2011, the
first annual decline on record going back to 2001.  Investors in China held 11.1 percent of the $11.5 trillion
of marketable  U.S. debt  in July, compared with a record 14
percent in June 2009.  Treasuries held by  Japanese investors  rose for the first
time in four months, adding $52 billion, or 4.8 percent, to
$1.135 trillion. It was the largest increase since November 2011
following Japanese currency interventions earlier that year.  All foreign investors owned 48.7 percent of the marketable
debt, the least since Feb. 2007, the data, known as Treasury
International Capital, show.  Holdings of the debt by overseas investors fell by $10.5
billion, or 0.2 percent in July to $5.59 trillion. It was the
first four-month decline in overseas holdings since 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
