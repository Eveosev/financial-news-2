Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
Topix index retreating for the third time in four days, ahead of
a Federal Reserve meeting starting today at which it may decide
to reduce the pace of stimulus.  Mobile-phone operators  KDDI Corp. (9433)  and SoftBank Corp. sank
at least 3.8 percent after larger rival NTT DoCoMo Inc.
announced pricing measures for the new iPhones. Daiichi Sankyo
Co. fell 6.8 percent after U.S. regulators restricted drug
imports from a facility of its Indian unit Ranbaxy Laboratories
Ltd. Sharp Corp. advanced 6.6 percent on a report the loss-making TV manufacturer will book a profit in the first half.  The Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 1,181.64 at the close in
 Tokyo  after rising as much as 0.6 percent. Volume was 62 percent
above the 30-day average. The  gauge  gained 3.3 percent last week
on optimism Tokyo’s winning bid to host the 2020  Olympic Games 
would boost corporate profits. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost
0.7 percent to 14,311.67. Markets were closed yesterday.  “Japanese stocks fell after rallying a bit too much last
week on good news such as the Olympics,” said Tetsuo Seshimo, a
Tokyo-based portfolio manager at Saison Asset Management Co.,
which oversees about 76 billion yen ($767 million). “Plus,
investors want to wait for the Fed’s meeting and I see a 50-50
chance for stimulus reduction.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent. The Fed is expected to reduce its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at the end of the two-day
meeting. The equity measure closed at its highest level since
Aug. 5 yesterday after  Lawrence Summers  withdrew from the race
to lead the central bank, possibly paving the way for  Janet Yellen  to become the next head. Some investors say Yellen may
favor a slower reduction of stimulus.  Tapering Expected  “The market consensus is the Fed will decide to trim its
quantitative easing, but investors don’t want to shift their
positions one way or the other before the key event,” said
Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by value.  The Topix is up 37 percent this year, making Japanese
equities the best performers among developed markets. The
measure  traded  at 1.23 times book value today, compared with 2.5
for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
yesterday.  KDDI fell the most on the Nikkei 225 today, plunging 7.2
percent to 4,800 yen, while SoftBank dropped 3.8 percent to
6,360 yen. NTT DoCoMo’s prices and incentives for the iPhone 5S
and 5C are “quite surprising” and may lure KDDI and SoftBank
customers, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. analyst
Hideaki Tanaka wrote in a note. They may also be negative for
the company’s own earnings, he said. NTT DoCoMo lost 2.7 percent
to 156,900 yen.  Daiichi Sankyo  Daiichi Sankyo slid 6.8 percent to 1,772 yen after Ranbaxy
plummeted 30 percent yesterday. The U.S.  Food and Drug
Administration  issued an import alert dated Sept. 13 on a
Ranbaxy facility in Mohali, Punjab state. Daiichi Sankyo owns 64
percent of the Indian drugmaker.  Kansai Electric Power Co. dropped 2.2 percent to 1,229 yen
today, as Japan’s last operating nuclear reactor went offline
for maintenance, stoking concern about power shortages this
winter. Chubu Electric Power Co. fell 3 percent to 1,275 yen.  Among stocks that rose, Sharp jumped 6.6 percent to 370
yen. The Nikkei newspaper reported it’s likely to swing to an
operating profit of about 30 billion yen in the six months
through September from a year earlier on increased sales of
solar batteries and lower costs.  Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co. (5480)  soared 9.6 percent to 307 yen after
starting contract production for a unit of Nippon Steel &
Sumitomo Metal Corp., Japan’s biggest steelmaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
