U.S. stocks are poised to extend a
rally relative to gold that was interrupted at midyear when the
precious metal’s price climbed, according to Tobias Levkovich,
Citigroup Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the ratio between the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index and the price of gold for immediate delivery
since 1928, when index calculations begin. Levkovich based his
analysis on a similar chart, starting from 1888, that he cited
in a Sept. 13 report.  After reaching this year’s high on June 27, the ratio
dropped 14 percent in the next two months. The  S&P 500  peaked on
Aug. 2 and ended the period with a gain of only 1.1 percent.
Spot gold climbed 18 percent. The ratio then recovered most of
the decline as share prices moved higher again and the metal’s
price headed lower.  “Stocks still appear to be a much better investment
alternative” than the metal, the New York-based strategist
wrote. The S&P 500’s ratio to gold closed yesterday at 1.29,
below a reading derived from past moves, as the chart shows.  Levkovich made his first 2014 year-end estimate for the S&P
500 in the report. Earnings, asset values, economic growth,
consumer confidence and other criteria suggest the index will
end the year at 1,900, he wrote.  The estimate is 12 percent higher than yesterday’s close
and identical to previous calls by  Andrew Garthwaite , a global
strategist at Credit Suisse AG, and  David Kostin , Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
