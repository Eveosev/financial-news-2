Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
may face additional lawsuits from units of Legal & General Group
Plc, Prudential Plc and Standard Life Plc over a 2008 share
offering before its bailout by the U.K. government.  The pension managers may join an existing shareholder
lawsuit in London or file new complaints if they decide to
proceed with litigation, lawyers for the companies said in court
documents prepared for a hearing in London today. The investment
groups are “self-funded and have legitimate reasons in the
interest of their stakeholders for needing to retain control of
their own litigation,” according to the court filing.  RBS is already being sued by as many as 16,000 shareholders
who lost money investing in a 2008 share offering months before
the Edinburgh-based lender fell into government ownership. One
of the lawsuits in the group action claims damages of as much as
4 billion pounds ($6.4 billion), and names former Chief
Executive Officer  Fred Goodwin  and other managers as defendants.  The investors, who also include the U.K universities
pension fund, bought about 10 percent of the issued shares,
their  law firm , Quinn, Emanuel, Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, said in
the court filing. In July, a British judge combined at least
three shareholder suits into a single group action.  RBS is 81 percent owned by British taxpayers after getting
the world’s biggest bank bailout -- 45.5 billion pounds -- in
2008 and 2009 at the height of the global financial crisis.  Sarah Small, a spokeswoman for RBS in London, couldn’t
immediately comment.  The cases are:  John Greenwood  v. Frederick Goodwin & Ors,
High Court of Justice,  Chancery Division , HC13F01247; Trustees
of the Mineworkers’ Pension Scheme Ltd & Ors v. The Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc,  High Court  of Justice, Chancery Division,
HC13D01192; David James Lamont v. Frederick Goodwin & Ors; High
Court of Justice, Chancery Division, HC13C03047  To contact the reporter on this story:
