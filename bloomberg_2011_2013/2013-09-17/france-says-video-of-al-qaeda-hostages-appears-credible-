A video showing seven hostages,
including four French, being held by an al-Qaeda affiliate in
the Sahel, in  Africa , appears “credible,” the French Foreign 
Ministry said.  The video shows the seven hostages, who include a Dutchman,
a Swede, and a South African, saying they are in good health but
face death if their governments don’t negotiate their release,
said Mauritanian news agency Agence Nouakchott d’Information,
which procured the tape.  “At first view, this video appears credible and
constitutes a new proof the four French taken in Arlit on Sept.
16, 2010 are alive,” French Foreign Ministry Spokesman Philippe
Lalliot said. He said the video was in the process of being
authenticated.  The Sahel is an area between the  Sahara desert  and the 
Sudanese savanna. It includes parts of countries such as Gambia, 
Senegal, Mauritania, Mali,  Burkina Faso  and  Algeria .   The French were taken by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
near a uranium mine where they worked in northern Mali. The
other three hostages were taken Nov. 25, 2011 in Timbuktu.  The video was filmed June 27, 2013, ANI said, citing the
speech of one of the hostages. It’s the first video of the
hostages since September 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
