Lucky Cement Ltd.,  Pakistan ’s
largest producer of the building material, reported a 47 percent
increase in full-year profit because of higher prices.  Net  income  rose to a record 10 billion rupees ($95 million),
or 30.33 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30 from
6.78 billion rupees, or 20.97 rupees, a year earlier, the
Karachi-based company said today in a filing to the stock
exchange. Gross sales rose 63 percent to 63.9 billion rupees.  The company increased the price of a 50 kilogram (110 pound)
bag by 11 percent to 458 rupees, said Kumail Chevelwalla, an
analyst with Karachi-based brokerage Alternate Research. The
company said it plans to pay a final dividend of 8 rupees a
share.  “The consumption of cement in the country is expected to
grow due to the government allocation of funds toward
development,” Lucky Cement said in the statement. “Anticipated
increase in utility cost, weakening of the Pakistani rupee
against the  U.S. dollar  and the recent interest rate hike by the
central bank are some of the key challenges.”  Lucky shares fell 0.7 percent to 249.83 rupees at the close
of trade in Karachi. The stock has rallied 65 percent this year,
compared with a 38 percent gain in the benchmark Karachi Stock
Exchange 100 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
