Outerwall Inc. (OUTR) , owner of the Redbox
DVD kiosks, fell to its lowest level in more than seven months
after cutting its third-quarter and full-year forecasts because
of discounts and shorter rentals.  Outerwall, formerly known as Coinstar Inc., dropped 12
percent to $49.49 at the close in New York, its lowest level
since Feb. 11. The shares had gained 7.6 percent this year
through yesterday.  Sales this quarter will be $569 million to $589 million,
below an earlier prediction of as much as $630 million, the
Bellevue, Washington-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Profit excluding items will be 82 cents to 94 cents a
share, less than the $1.36 to $1.51 a share seen previously.  Outerwall’s DVD promotional strategy, while bringing in
customers, led to more single-night rentals and revenue that was
less than projected, according to the statement. The Redbox
vending machines posted their best month ever in July, with
rentals increasing 13 percent to about 74 million from a year
earlier. Shoppers kept movies out for fewer nights in August,
too, Outerwall said.  The company is reducing its content costs and direct
operating expenses to counter the change in consumer behavior,
said Chief Executive Officer J. Scott Di Valerio.  “Redbox has numerous promotions and discounted offers at
varying levels encouraging increased rental activity,” Marci Maule, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. “We’re not referring
to a single promotion.”  For the year, the company sees revenue of as much as $2.34
billion, below the previous peak forecast of $2.48 billion made
in July. Profit excluding items will be as much as $5.12 a
share, below the $5.76 to $6.26 a share seen earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
