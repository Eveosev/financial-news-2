Crop prices are set to extend a
slump as surging global wheat production adds to record supplies
of corn and oilseeds, an Australian government forecaster said.  The price at ports in the U.S. Gulf of hard-red winter
wheat, the most exported U.S. variety, may average $305 a metric
ton in the year started July 1 from $315 forecast in June and
$348 a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
Resource Economics and Sciences said in a  report . World output
will gain 6.4 percent to 695 million tons, it said.  Wheat traded in  Chicago  lost 17 percent this year as global
harvests are set to expand to a record. World  food costs  fell
for a fourth month in August to the lowest level in more than a
year on lower grain prices, according to the  United Nations .
Corn slumped 34 percent in 2013 and soybeans lost 4.1 percent.  “Wheat production is forecast to increase in most of the
major growing regions in the northern hemisphere,” particularly
the Black Sea area and  Europe , said Abares. The extent of the
decline may be less than other varieties of wheat, reflecting a
smaller increase in world production of higher protein varieties,
including U.S. hard-red winter wheat, it said.  Australia lowered its harvest estimate last week after dry
weather in the biggest producing states curbed yields. Output is
set to reach 24.5 million tons, 3.5 percent less than a June
estimate and compared with 22.1 million tons a year earlier,
Canberra-based Abares said Sept. 10.  Global Harvests  Farmers worldwide will harvest 708.9 million tons in 2013-2014, the most ever, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture . A 16 percent increase in  Canada  and gains of 43
percent in  Russia  and 40 percent in Ukraine will counter a 6.8
percent drop in the U.S., the USDA predicts. About 15 percent of
 China ’s wheat production, or as much as 20 million tons, is
expected to be downgraded to feed use because of frost damage
during winter and excessive rain during harvest, said Abares.  The rebound in global output follows last year’s dry
weather that hurt harvests from Australia to Russia, pushing
prices to a four-year high of $9.4725 a bushel in July 2012.
Prices fell to $6.355 on Aug. 14, the lowest since June 2012.  World corn production will increase 11 percent to a record
957 million tons as U.S. farmers harvest an all-time high of 350
million tons, Abares said. The Gulf price for U.S. corn will
average $235 a ton in the year started July 1 from $312 a year
earlier, according to the bureau.  Oilseeds  Soybean prices at ports in the U.S. Gulf will drop 15
percent to $510 a ton in 2013-2014 as global output of the
oilseed and canola climb to records, said Abares.  World food costs tracked by the Rome-based Food &
Agriculture Organization dropped 1.9 percent last month and are
15 percent below the record set in February 2011. The agency’s
cereals  index  has tumbled 16 percent this year.  Hard-red winter wheat, used to make bread, is the largest
variety of wheat produced and exported by the U.S., the world’s
biggest shipper, according to the USDA. While  Australia  was the
third-biggest exporter in 2012-2013, it may drop to fourth in
2013-2014 as Canada boosts shipments, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
