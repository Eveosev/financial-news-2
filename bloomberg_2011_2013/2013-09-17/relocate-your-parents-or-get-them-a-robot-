No matter the economic downsides of the world’s coming  demographic transition , one industry will boom: eldercare. Now that mom is less likely to die at the age of 60 from pneumonia or a sudden stroke, she’s more likely to require years of intensive care as time slowly saps her ability to take care of herself. She's also less likely to have multiple children who can chip in to provide that care. Such care, delivered at the level that many people would hope to provide their parents, is enormously expensive. This is not because the U.S. is overcompensating our nursing homes; even private nursing facilities  don’t have magnificent profit margins . And Germans, who have government-provided long-term care insurance,  seem to be finding themselves in the same boat , as this Bloomberg story points out: As you may guess from this paragraph, the solution that many Germans have hit on is to export their parents to nursing homes in Eastern Europe, where lower wages allow a better standard of care at a lower cost. The rub is that nursing home care is inherently low-productivity. True, innovations have let seniors  live longer on their own , from  those chairs that lift you up the stairs , to step-in bathtubs, and life-alert systems if you fall anyway. But if you need help dressing and going to the bathroom, or the constant gentle supervision that dementia patients require, there’s no substitute for a human being.  Of course, nursing homes do not have one staff member per patient. But the patient-to-staff ratio can’t be too high without endangering the patients. Right now,  U.S. nursing homes use over 4 hours of staff-time per patient day , and many people think this is too low. Unfortunately, as the linked study concludes, getting more staff time -- particularly more registered nurse time, would require substantially improving reimbursement rates. The Japanese solution seems to be  developing robots to care for nursing home patients . That would certainly raise the productivity of nursing home facilities, but as the Economist suggests, there are some wrinkles left to be worked out.  Not even mentioned: How will a patient with dementia react when a giant machine grabs her and tries to brush her teeth? Germany’s solution not only saves the government money, but also, at least in some cases, allows for a higher standard of care, because everyone in Poland, from nurses aides to doctors, makes much less. But that’s not exactly a free lunch. It’s harder to monitor the care your parents are getting if they’re across a national border. And if you want to bring them back, as the Bloomberg piece shows, things may get very complicated indeed. And it certainly won’t work in a country like the U.S., where the state Medicaid systems handling most nursing-home care aren’t going to pay for you to be relocated to a nursing home in Belize. Though perhaps we’d better reconsider that -- or else we’d better get cracking on inventing better robots.
