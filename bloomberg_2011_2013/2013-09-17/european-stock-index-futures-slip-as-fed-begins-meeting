European stocks  declined from a
five-year high as investors sold holdings in companies from
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  to Continental AG.  Lloyds dropped 3.5 percent after the U.K. government sold a
3.2 billion-pound ($5.1 billion) stake in the lender.
Continental and Galp Energia SGPS SA fell at least 2.5 percent
as investors sold shares in the companies.  Total SA (FP)  retreated
1.3 percent following a report that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA
may dispose of its 4 percent stake in the French oil producer.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.5 percent to 311.95 at
the close in  London  after yesterday rallying to its highest
level in more than five years. The volume of shares changing
hands in companies listed on the equity benchmark was 16 percent
greater than the average of the past 30 days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “After the big move we saw yesterday, it only makes sense
that we see a pullback today and that investors see it as a good
time to sell,” said Dirk Thiels, who helps oversee 65 billion
euros ($87 billion) as head of  investment management  at KBC
Asset Management NV in Brussels.  European stocks advanced yesterday as Lawrence H. Summers
withdrew from the running to replace  Ben S. Bernanke  as Federal
Reserve chairman. That removed  Janet Yellen ’s main competitor
from the contest to take the Fed’s top job. Yellen would reduce
the central bank’s  monthly asset purchases  at a slower rate,
according to a Bloomberg Global Poll last week.  FOMC Meeting  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will probably decide at a
two-day policy meeting starting today to lower its $85 billion
of monthly bond purchases by $10 billion, according to the
median estimate of 34 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
earlier this month. Economists forecast in a July survey that
the Fed would reduce its asset purchases by $20 billion.  “People are also more uncertain regarding what the Fed
might say this week,” Thiels said. “We want to see how the Fed
reads the economy now.”  In  Germany , a report showed that investor confidence in
 Europe ’s largest economy increased in September to the highest
level since April 2010.  An index  compiled by the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research, which aims to predict economic
developments six months in advance, rose to 49.6 from 42 in
August. That exceeded the median  economist  projection for a
reading of 45.  National benchmark indexes dropped in 14 of the 18 western-European markets today. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 fell
0.2 percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 declined 0.8 percent.  Stake Sales  Lloyds retreated 3.5 percent to 74.7 pence after UK
Financial Investments Ltd. sold a 6 percent stake in Britain’s
largest mortgage lender. The body, which oversees the
government’s holdings in banks, said it sold 4.28 billion shares
at 75 pence apiece. The transaction reduced the  government’s 
stake in Lloyds to 32.7 percent from 38.7 percent.  Continental fell 3.1 percent to 123 euros after Schaeffler
AG and Schaeffler Verwaltungs GmbH sold a combined stake of 4
percent in Europe’s second-largest maker of auto parts.
Schaeffler and its holding company sold 7.8 million shares at
122.50 euros a share, according to a statement.  Galp Energia dropped 2.5 percent to 12.37 euros as terms
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed Citigroup Inc. is offering 3.5
million shares in the Portuguese utility for 12.25 euros apiece,
on behalf of an unidentified investor.  Total declined 1.3 percent to 42.38 euros, its biggest drop
this month. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert said it wasn’t planning an
imminent sale of its stake in Europe’s third-largest  oil
explorer . De Tijd reported earlier today that the holding
company may sell its holding in Total. The Belgian newspaper
cited analysts.  Carmakers Drop  A gauge of carmakers slipped 1.4 percent from its highest
level in at least 26 years after a report showed  European car
sales  fell 4.9 percent in August. Volkswagen AG lost 1.5 percent
to 180.25 euros. PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault SA,  France ’s
biggest automobile manufacturers, dropped 2.5 percent to 12.32
euros and 2.4 percent to 58.15 euros, respectively.  Glencore Xstrata Plc retreated 2.3 percent to 334.2 pence
as UBS AG cut its  rating  on the stock to neutral from buy. The
brokerage said that Glencore’s valuation will limit further
gains by the shares until the outlook for copper and coal prices
improves. The mining company trades at 18 times  projected
earnings , compared with 10.2 times earnings for Rio Tinto Group
and 15.1 times for a gauge of European commodity producers.  Investec Plc slid 3.6 percent to 425.8 pence. The  money
manager  with businesses in  South Africa  and the U.K. projected
that adjusted earnings per share for the six months ending Sept.
30 will drop as much as 10 percent in pounds from a year earlier
after the rand weakened against the British currency.  Royal Philips NV declined 1.9 percent to 24.43 euros after
setting a target for its earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization margin of 11 percent to 12 percent from 2014 to
2016. The goal fell short of Morgan Stanley’s projection for a
11 percent to 13 percent range, according to a note from analyst
 Ben Uglow .  To contact the reporter on this story:
