Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures were
little changed before the start of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s
policy meeting.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  dropped 0.1 percent to 5,854 at
9:56 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the
National Stock Exchange of  India  Ltd. fell 0.2 percent to
5,840.55 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex gained less than 0.1
percent to 19,742.47. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares rose 0.9 percent to 999.40.  Fed members will decide whether to reduce their $85
billion-a-month stimulus program, with Treasury purchases to be
cut by $10 billion, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Reserve
Bank  of India governor  Raghuram Rajan  unveils his first monetary
police decision this week after data yesterday showed inflation
unexpectedly accelerated to a six-month high in August as the
rupee’s slide stoked import costs.  “With two big central banks meetings this week investors
are reluctant to take big bets,”  Arun Kejriwal , director at
Kejriwal Research & Investment Services Pvt. in Mumbai, said by
phone from Mumbai today. “It’s a wait and watch game for now.”  Overseas investors  sold a net $12.3 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 13, data from the regulator show. That pared
this year’s net inflow to $12.4 billion, still the second-highest among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. Foreigners
pulled $3.7 billion from local equities in the three months to
Aug. 31 as capital fled emerging markets amid prospects of the
Fed paring its record stimulus.  Stock Valuations  The Sensex has increased 1.6 percent this year in local
currency terms and is  valued  at 13.9 times projected 12-month
earnings, compared with the five-year average of 14.1 times,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has lost 12 percent this
year in dollar terms. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index trades at
10.6 times.  India’s central bank raised two  interest rates  on July 15
and restricted lenders’ access to cash to slow depreciation in
the currency. Policy makers also tightened limits on overseas
investments by local companies and curbed gold imports.  Asia’s third-largest economy may expand 5.5 percent in the
year to March 2014, versus 5 percent in the previous 12-month
period, the weakest pace since 2003, according to central bank
estimates. The 10-year average is about 8 percent.  The economic slowdown and a weak currency are hurting
company earnings. Combined profits for the 30 companies in the
Sensex increased 1.4 percent in the three months ended June
compared with an estimate of 5.8 percent before the reporting
season began, Bank of America Corp. analysts Jyotivardhan Jaipuria and Anand Kumar wrote in a report dated Aug. 19.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. That compares
with 27 percent for the March quarter, and 43 percent in the
three months ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
