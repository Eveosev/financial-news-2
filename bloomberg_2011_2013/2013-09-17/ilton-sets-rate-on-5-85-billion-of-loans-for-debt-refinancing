Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., the
hotel operator owned by  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , is planning to
borrow $12.6 billion and use the money along with the proceeds
from an initial public offering to refinance debt.  The world’s largest hotel chain is seeking to raise $5.85
billion of loans and sell $3.25 billion of bonds and $3.5
billion of commercial mortgage-backed securities, according to a
statement from  Standard & Poor’s . Hilton plans to raise $1.25
billion in an IPO, according to a Sept. 12 regulatory filing.  Blackstone’s 2007 leveraged buyout of Hilton for $26
billion was the largest ever of a hotel company, Bloomberg data
show. The McLean, Virginia-based company had $15.1 billion in
total debt as of June 30, according to its Sept. 12 filing.  “Since the LBO was announced in July 2007, the underlying
fundamentals have substantially improved, with Hilton’s
performance exceeding that of peers,” Chris Snow, an analyst at
debt-research firm CreditSights Inc., said in a Sept. 13 report.
“The challenged leveraged buyout is poised to return to the
public market with a high, but manageable, degree of financial
risk.”  Term Loans  A $5 billion loan portion that matures in seven years may
pay interest at 3.25 percentage points to 3.5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. An $850 million component coming due in
five years is being offered at 3 percentage points more than
Libor, with both pieces having a 1 percent minimum on the
lending benchmark, the person said.  Hilton will issue $1.25 billion in eight-year senior
secured notes and $2 billion of senior unsecured notes due in
2021 and 2023, S&P said in today’s statement.  The covenant-light loan financing, meaning there are no
financial-maintenance requirements, is being arranged by.
Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The transaction also
includes a $1 billion revolving credit facility and commitments
are due by Sept. 26, according to the person.  The seven-year loan is being offered to lenders at 99 cents
on the dollar, while the $850 million piece is being offered at
99.5 cents, the person said. Debt offered below par reduces
proceeds for the company and increases yield for investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
