UBS AG (UBSN)  won a judge’s preliminary
approval of its $120 million settlement of claims by investors
in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. securities in a lawsuit tied to
the investment bank’s 2008 collapse.  UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank, agreed in August to settle
allegations that it violated federal securities laws in
underwriting and selling the securities to investors, who
claimed that offering materials contained misleading information
about Lehman Brothers’ financial condition.  U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  in New York yesterday
granted provisional approval to the accord and certified the
settlement class to include those who purchased securities
issued by Lehman and sold by UBS’s Financial Services unit in
2007 and 2008. He said a settlement fund of $120 million, before
deductions of attorneys’ fees, expenses and costs, will be
distributed to certain investors who bought or acquired the
securities.  The judge scheduled a fairness hearing for Dec. 10 and said
he will retain jurisdiction over the case. Lehman filed for
bankruptcy in September 2008.  The case is In re Lehman Brothers Securities and Erisa
Litigation, 09-md-02017, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
