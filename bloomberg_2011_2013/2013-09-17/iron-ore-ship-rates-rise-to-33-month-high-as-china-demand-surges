Charter rates for the largest iron
ore-carrying ships reached a 33-month high on rebuilding of
inventories in  China , the world’s biggest importer of the
steelmaking raw material.  Hire rates for Capesize vessels, each 1,000 feet long and
able to haul at least 150,000 metric tons of cargo, rose 9.7
percent to $32,945 a day, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the
London-based publisher of shipping costs on global maritime
routes. That was the highest since Nov. 24, 2010, data compiled
by Bloomberg showed.  Declining  iron-ore  prices spurred restocking at Chinese
 steel mills , according to Marc Pauchet, a senior analyst at
London-based ACM Shipping Group Plc. Ore shipments to China from
 Australia  and  Brazil , the world’s two biggest exporters, also
increased as production expands, according to Danske Bank
Markets. Capesize rents gained for a 23rd session in 24 today on
the Brazil-to-China route.  “For shipowners, this is very positive,” said Rune Sand,
an analyst at Carnegie SA in Oslo whose recommendations on the
shares of shipping companies returned 18 percent in the past
year. “Forward contract rates are also surging, meaning owners
can lock in revenues at attractive rates now.”  Ore Prices  Iron ore delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin dropped
2.2 percent today, the most in four weeks, to $131.10 a dry ton,
according to data from The Steel Index Ltd., part of McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. Prices fell 9.5 percent this year.  Iron ore  stockpiles fell 1.8 percent to 70.4 million tons
in the week ended Sept. 13 and are the lowest for the time of
year since 2010, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development.  Australia’s Port Hedland, the world’s biggest bulk
terminal, shipped 22.3 million tons of iron ore to China last
month, 34 percent more than a year earlier, port data show.
Brazilian exports of 31.2 million tons were the highest for the
month in two years, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
