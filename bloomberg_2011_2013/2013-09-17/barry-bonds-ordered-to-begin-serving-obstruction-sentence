Barry Bonds ,  Major League
Baseball ’s career home-run record holder, was told to start
serving his sentence for obstructing a federal grand jury probe
into steroid use by athletes.  “The defendant is ordered to confer with the probation
office forthwith to make arrangements to begin serving his
sentence,” U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said yesterday in
a filing in  San Francisco  federal court. Prosecutors and lawyers
for the former San Francisco Giants outfielder agreed yesterday
that the hold on his sentence should be lifted.  Bonds was sentenced to 30 days of home confinement, 250
hours of community service and a $4,000 fine after he was
convicted of making evasive and misleading statements to the
grand jury. A federal appeals court upheld the conviction on
Sept. 13.  Bonds, who was named most valuable player a record seven
times, broke  Hank Aaron ’s record of 755 career home runs in
August 2007. He was indicted in November of that year on perjury
and obstruction charges.  Illston declared a mistrial on the perjury counts after the
jury couldn’t agree on whether Bonds was lying when he denied
knowingly taking performance enhancing drugs.  The case is U.S. v Bonds, 07-cr-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
