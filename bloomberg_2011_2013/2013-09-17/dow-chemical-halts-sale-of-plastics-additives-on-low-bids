Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical producer by sales, no longer plans to sell its
plastics-additives business because bidders didn’t offer enough.  Dow is “quite comfortable” continuing to run the
additives business for cash, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Liveris  said today in a presentation at a
conference organized by Credit Suisse Group AG.  “This is a valuable business that is currently being
undervalued by buyers in the market,” Liveris said. “As a
result, we’re pulling the transaction off the table.” He didn’t
say how much was offered for the unit.  Dow, based in Midland, Michigan, continues to pursue the
sale of other units as outlined earlier this year, Liveris said.
The plastics-additives unit was part of $1.5 billion in proposed
divestitures, along with a fumigants unit and polypropylene
licensing and catalysts, announced in March.  Liveris in July also announced possible sales of slow
growing, low-profit units with $6 billion in combined revenue. A
divestiture or formation of a joint venture is “particularly”
likely for the epoxy and chlorine derivatives units, Liveris
said today.  Plastics additives, with about $680 million in annual sales
and $80 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization, is worth about $520 million,  Hassan Ahmed , a
New York-based analyst at Alembic Global Advisors, said in an
Aug. 5 note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
