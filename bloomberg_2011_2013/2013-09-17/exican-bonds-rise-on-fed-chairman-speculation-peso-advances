Mexico’s peso bonds climbed on
speculation the next chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve will
maintain for a longer period a stimulus program that has boosted
emerging markets.  Yields on benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 6.13 percent at 4 p.m. in
Mexico City, the lowest closing level since Aug. 15, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The peso rallied yesterday as  Lawrence Summers , a former
U.S. Treasury secretary, withdrew his candidacy as Fed chairman.
Summers would have tightened monetary policy more than his main
rival, Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen , according to a Bloomberg
Global Poll last week. Mexico’s securities markets were closed
yesterday for a holiday.  The rally in bonds is “quite simply just a catchup,”
Alejandro Silva, a founding partner at Silva Capital Management
LLC who helps manage $800 million in emerging-market assets,
said in a telephone interview from Chicago. “The Summers
headline event was a pretty big deal.”  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to 12.9216 per  U.S. dollar 
today. It climbed 0.9 percent yesterday on the Fed outlook, the
best performance among major Latin American currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
