Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , Japan’s second-biggest automaker, expects car sales in some  emerging markets  to
rebound next year.  The fall in car deliveries in Brazil, Russia and  India  is a
short-term adjustment and sales in these markets will rise in
2014, Nissan Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said in an
interview in Jakarta yesterday.  Carmakers in India are bracing for the first annual drop in
passenger vehicle sales in more than a decade as an economic
slowdown damps demand. Deliveries in Brazil dropped a third
consecutive month in August, while sales in Russia have declined
for six straight months. Ghosn said there was long-term
potential in markets such as Brazil and India because of the low
ownership of cars per capita.  “Even though the situation is a little bit tough in some
of the high growth markets we don’t think it is going to last,”
said Ghosn, who also heads  Renault SA. (RNO)  “When you see that in
 Portugal  you have 500 cars per 1,000 residents, or 200 cars per
1,000 residents in Brazil or 300 per 1,000 residents in Russia
or less than 50 cars per 1,000 residents in India, you know that
the trend is up.”  The automaker doesn’t forecast a “great year in 2014” for
Indonesia, Ghosn said, without elaborating.  Nissan yesterday unveiled its first two models under the
Datsun brand in Indonesia, called the Go and Go+.  The carmaker will begin deliveries in the country next year
of the Go hatchback, which was first showcased in India in July,
and the Go+ minivan, Ghosn said at a press conference in
Jakarta. They will be priced at less than 100 million rupiah
($8,990), he said.  Nissan expects Datsun to contribute half of its sales in
Indonesia by 2016, and the Yokohama, Japan-based company will
almost triple capacity in Southeast Asia’s most populous nation
to 250,000 units annually from 90,000, Ghosn said.  The automaker plans to begin selling the Datsun in India,
Indonesia, Russia and  South Africa  next year as part of its
emerging markets push, targeting first-time buyers upgrading
from motorcycles or used cars, Ghosn said in March 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
