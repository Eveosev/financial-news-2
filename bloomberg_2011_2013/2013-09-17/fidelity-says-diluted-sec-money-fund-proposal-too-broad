Fidelity Investments , the largest
U.S. provider of money-market mutual funds, urged regulators to
scale back an already watered-down proposal for making the $2.6
trillion industry safer.  A proposal offered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission in June would force funds holding 65 percent of the
industryâ€™s assets to adopt a floating share price, not 30
percent, as the SEC estimated, Boston-based Fidelity said today
in a comment letter filed with the agency.  Regulators, who proposed excluding retail funds from the
floating share price rule, should narrow how they would define
retail funds and should exclude all funds that focus on tax-exempt, or municipal, debt, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
