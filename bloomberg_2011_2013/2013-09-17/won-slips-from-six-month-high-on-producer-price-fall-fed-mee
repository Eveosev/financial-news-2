South Korea’s won retreated from a
six-month high and government bonds gained after data showing an
11th straight monthly decline in producer prices raised concern
that the economy lacks momentum.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , which is meeting today
and tomorrow, may take a decision on whether to cut the stimulus
that drove funds to  emerging markets . South Korea’s Producer
Price Index fell 1.3 percent in August from a year earlier,
compared with a 1 percent drop in July,  Bank of Korea  reported
today. The monetary authority kept the seven-day repurchase rate
at 2.5 percent for a fourth straight month on Sept. 12.  The won declined 0.3 percent to 1,085.25 per dollar as of
10:11 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency reached 1,081.11 yesterday, the strongest since
February. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.12 percent.  “A weaker PPI flags that there’s quite a slack in the
economy and there’s less pressure for the central bank to raise
 interest rates ” in South Korea, said Roy Teo, a currency
strategist at ABN Amro Bank NV in Singapore.“Going to the FOMC
on the 18th, we should see the dollar recover.”  The  Federal Reserve  will probably trim its monthly bond-buying program by $10 billion to $75 billion this week, a survey
of economists showed this month.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016
dropped two basis points to 2.87 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. That’s the lowest level since July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
