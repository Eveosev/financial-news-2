Spot wholesale electricity dropped
in the Northeast as demand fell below forecasts amid cooler-than-normal weather.  Power consumption slipped below day-ahead forecasts in New
England, New York and on the 13-state network managed by PJM
Interconnection LLC, according to their websites.  Entergy Corp. (ETR) 
raised output at a Massachusetts nuclear reactor after shutting
it for repairs last week, boosting Northeast generating supply.
PJM prices were little changed near a seven-month low.  A slow-moving cold front will keep temperatures below
normal across the regions over the next few days, said WSI Corp.
in Andover, Massachusetts. The high in  Manhattan  today may be 67
degrees Fahrenheit (19 Celsius), 8 below normal, and Washington
may be 9 lower than average at 70 degrees, data show from
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Spot prices for  New York City  slid $4.71, or 13 percent, to
average $30.19 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 10 a.m.
from the same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Boston fell $7.41, or 19 percent, to $30.76.  New York traded at a discount of 57 cents to Boston after
fetching an average on-peak premium of $3.23 yesterday.  Entergy increased production at the Pilgrim 1 reactor,
about 4 miles (6 kilometers) east of Plymouth, to 75 percent of
capacity from 45 percent yesterday, according to Nuclear
Regulatory Commission filings.  Nuclear Plant  The plant was connected to the grid Sept. 15 after
personnel completed a small steam leak repair associated with
the unit’s feed water system, Carol Wightman, a spokeswoman at
the plant, said in an e-mail yesterday. The reactor’s summer
capacity is 685 megawatts, Energy Information Administration
data show.  Nuclear output rose in the PJM region, which serves more
than 60 million people from  Washington  to  Chicago . Exelon Corp.
boosted output at the Limerick 2 reactor, about 30 miles
northwest of Philadelphia, to full capacity from 95 percent
yesterday, NRC filings show. The reactor’s summer capacity is
1,150 megawatts, according to the EIA.  Spot power at PJM’s benchmark  Western hub  was little
changed, averaging $30.04 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended
at 10 a.m. versus $29.98 the same time yesterday. The  on-peak
average  yesterday was $30.01, the least since Jan. 29. On-peak
hours are Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  The grid operator cut its peak-demand  forecast  for today to
90,265 megawatts, down 2.8 percent from the day-ahead
projection. Power use peaked at 93,366 megawatts yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
