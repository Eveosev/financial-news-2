Mediobanca SpA (MB) ,  Italy ’s biggest
publicly traded investment bank, posted a fiscal fourth-quarter
loss after writing down equity holdings of 287 million euros
($384 million).  The net loss of 217 million euros in the three months to
June 30 compared with a loss of 24 million euros a year earlier,
the Milan-based bank said in a statement today. Mediobanca said
it scrapped a dividend on fiscal year results in accordance with
the Bank of Italy’s recommendations.  Chief Executive Officer Alberto Nagel is planning to sell
stakes in companies including  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) ,
 Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  and  RCS Mediagroup SpA (RCS)  as part of a plan to
return Mediobanca to profit. In June, the bank accounted for all
of its publicly traded securities, with the exception of
Generali, as assets available for sale, writing down their value
based on market price. The bank forecasts revenue from banking
activities of 2.1 billion euros by 2016 under a three-year plan.  Extraordinary losses in the fiscal year included 38.5
million euros of writedowns for shares the bank owns in
publisher RCS and 319.7 million euros for its 12 percent stake
in Telco SpA, the company controlling Telecom Italia.  Mediobanca’s shares climbed 0.5 percent to 5.05 euros at
1:23 p.m. in Milan, taking gains this year to 8.3 percent and
valuing the company at 4.4 billion euros. The benchmark Stoxx
600 Banks Index advanced 14 percent since December.  Mediobanca’s loan-loss provisions increased to 142.8
million euros in the quarter from 141.5 million euros a year
ago. Revenue fell 6.3 percent to 423.6 million euros, while
operating costs rose 0.8 percent to 195.4 million euros.  The core Tier 1 capital ratio, a key measure of financial
strength, fell to 11.7 percent as of June 30 from 12 percent at
the end of March, Mediobanca said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
