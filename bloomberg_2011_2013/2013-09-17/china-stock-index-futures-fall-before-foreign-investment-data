China’s stocks fell the most in two
months after foreign investment data trailed economists’
estimates and money-market rates rose before the start of
holidays this week.  Liquor maker  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  plunged 5.6 percent,
dragging a gauge of consumer-staples producers to the second-biggest loss among industry groups.  Shanghai  Pudong Development
Bank Co. and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led declines for lenders
and developers with a retreat of more than 3 percent. Shanghai
International Port (Group) Co.  dropped  10 percent after UBS AG
downgraded the stock to sell. China Eastern Airlines Corp.
tumbled 7.1 percent after surging 27 percent since Aug. 22.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 2.1 percent to 2,185.56
at the close, the most since July 8. A report showed foreign-direct investment grew 0.6 percent last month, compared with the
Bloomberg estimate of 12.5 percent growth. A gauge of funding
availability in the banking system climbed as demand for cash
increased ahead of local holidays.  “It’s pretty heavy profit taking after the recent rally
and investors are using poor data as an excuse to sell shares,”
said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at
Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages $120 million.  The Shanghai index has risen 12 percent since this year’s
low on June 27 as data ranging from exports to industrial output
showed growth is accelerating and as companies based in the city
surged after the State Council approved a free-trade zone.  Chinese markets will close on Sept. 19 and 20 for the mid-Autumn festival and Oct. 1 to 7 for National Day holidays. The
CSI 300 Index slipped 2.1 percent to 2,427.32 today. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index retreated 0.7 percent. The
Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese
stocks in the U.S. rose 0.4 percent yesterday.  ‘Soft’ FDI  China ’s non-financial foreign direct investment rose in
August from a year earlier to $8.38 billion, according to the
Ministry of Commerce. Foreign investment growth slowed from 24.1
percent in July. The Conference Board’s leading index for China
climbed 0.7 percent to 269.3 last month from 267.4 in July.  “While the FDI figure is rather soft this, in my opinion,
is not an indication that the economic recovery is weaker than
expected,” said Gerry Alfonso, a trader at Shenyin & Wanguo
Securities Co. in Shanghai. “FDI is becoming very volatile but
the main driver on China’s economic growth is not any more
foreign investment but domestic capital.”  A measure of consumer-staples producers in the CSI 300 slid
2.4 percent, the second most among 10 industry groups. Kweichow
Moutai, China’s biggest liquor maker by market value, declined
5.6 percent to 141.30  yuan .  Financials Slump  “Sales of Moutai and other liquors are said to sell not
very well ahead of holidays so these shares are being dumped,”
Jingxi Investment’s Wang said.  Shanghai Pudong bank declined 5.7 percent to 10.83 yuan.
Shanghai-based Bank of Communications retreated 3.5 percent to
4.41 yuan. Ping An Bank lost 3.1 percent to 12.79 yuan. Poly
Real Estate Group, the second-biggest developer, declined 3.7
percent to 10.59 yuan.  China’s one-year interest rate swaps rose from the lowest
level in a month, while the seven-day repurchase rate climbed
eight basis points to 3.58 percent, according to a weighted
average compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The Shanghai measure is  valued  at 8.8 times its projected
12-month earnings, compared with the five-year average of 12.6
times, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading volumes
were 12 percent above the 30-day average, Bloomberg data showed.  Trade Zone  Shanghai International Port plunged by the daily limit to
5.87 yuan, paring a rally to 130 percent since Aug. 22, when the
Ministry of Commerce said the city’s free-trade zone proposal
had been approved in July. The shares were cut from buy at UBS,
according to a note dated yesterday. Shanghai-based China
Eastern Airlines, the nation’s second-biggest domestic carrier,
dropped 7.1 percent to 3.03 yuan.  An opening ceremony for a Shanghai free-trade zone to test
economic reforms is planned for this month, with Chinese Premier
Li Keqiang set to officiate, two people with knowledge of the
matter said. The event may be on a day from Sept. 27 to 29,
depending on Li’s schedule, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly
about the matter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
