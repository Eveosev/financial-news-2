Sugar production in  Australia , the
world’s third biggest exporter, may be lower than earlier
estimated as yellow canopy syndrome in some growing regions
curbed yields, a government forecaster said.  Output may total 4.3 million metric tons in the year
started July 1, compared with 4.5 million tons predicted in June
and unchanged from last year, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said in a
 report  today. Exports may reach 3 million tons from 3.2 million
tons forecast in June, it said.  Prices plunged 51 percent since reaching a three-decade
high in 2011 as growers from  Brazil  to Australia and  Mexico 
raised output. The Australian Sugar Milling Council forecasts
this year’s sugar cane harvest at about 30.6 million tons, down
from expectations of as much as 33 million tons.  The decline in production reflects “lower average sugar
yields, due in part to canopy syndrome disease in the Bundaberg
and Isis regions” as well as flood damage to new plantings in
early 2013, Canberra-based Abares said in the report.  More than 60 percent of the available cane crop was crushed
by the end of last week, according to the sugar milling council.  Raw-sugar for delivery in March slid 0.9 percent to 17.53
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York yesterday. Prices
reached 36.08 cents in February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
