Fininvest SpA, the holding company
owned by former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , must pay
Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA about 500 million euros ($668
million) in a case related to a takeover dating back to 1991,
Italy’s top court ruled today.  The Rome-based Supreme Court rejected all but one of
Fininvest’s challenges of an appeals court ruling, according to
an e-mailed copy of the decision.  “This decision isn’t justice, it’s a slap at justice,”
Marina Berlusconi, the daughter of the former premier and head
of Fininvest, said in an e-mailed statement.  Fininvest, which controls Berlusconi’s broadcast company
 Mediaset SpA (MS) , in October 2009 was ordered to pay damages to CIR
for bribing a judge during a takeover battle for publisher
 Arnoldo Mondadori Editore SpA (MN)  dating back to 1991.  An appeals court in July 2011 ruled in CIR’s favor and
Fininvest challenged the decision in  Italy ’s top court.  Shares of CIR, which controls publisher Gruppo Editoriale
L’Espresso SpA,  rose  6.9 percent in Milan today, the biggest
one-day gain in 13 months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
