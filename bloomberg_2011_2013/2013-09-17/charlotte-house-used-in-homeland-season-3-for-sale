14617 Rudolph Dadey Dr, Charlotte, NC For sale: $2.125 million When Mary Ann and Greg Taylor were first contacted by the producers of "Homeland," their home was going to be used for the good guys — a CIA agent who was spying on terrorists. However scripts change, and suddenly their home, a gorgeous 6-bedroom residence sitting on a golf course in Charlotte, became the residence of the bad guys — a group of terrorists depicted in Season 3, Episode 6 of the award-winning Showtime series. Much of "Homeland" is filmed in Charlotte, but Mary Ann Taylor was still surprised when her real estate agent,  Suzette Gray of Coldwell Banker , called her with the opportunity to use the house for the show. "They contacted my agent [and asked] would your clients be interested?" Taylor said. "It just came along, and we thought it would be fun to do. We also have a daughter who is a junior at Columbia University as a theater-drama major, and she was home this summer during the filming. So we thought it would be great to learn about the industry she's interested in." The Taylors did end up learning a lot about the industry and the magnitude of work it took just to make their home work for a single episode. Production managers were constantly in and out of the Taylors' home, taking measurements and photos and planning out the set as the script changed. "I should have kept a log of all the times they came back to the house," she said. "The site managers kept coming back and saying, 'Can we come look at the bedroom again? Can we look at the bathroom? Do you mind if we put a fence here?' Just over and over in the three to four weeks prior to filming." The crew only spent two days filming in the home but needed three days of setup before shooting began. By the end of it, several parts of the house were used, says Taylor, including parts of the yard, front door and foyer, kitchen, garage and 2 bedrooms — a room off the terrace level, as well as main-floor bedroom, which Taylor says they made the most changes to. Despite all the time filming, what ends up on-screen may only be a few moments. "All we know is that the house is in Episode 6," she said. "It'll be interesting to see how much time all those days and hours translate into on-screen." The Taylor home measures 9,960 square feet and sits on just over half an acre. The home was a spec house but includes a secret room and an elevator, 3 fireplaces and a kitchen with high-end appliances. An estimated monthly mortgage payment on the home would be $8,630, calculated with the Zillow  mortgage calculator  and assuming a 20 percent down payment on a 30-year mortgage.
