Investors expect German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  to retain power in an election and they will
probably move money to Europe as the economy recovers,  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co. KG said.  “There’s a clear expectation that Merkel will be involved
in the government in one form or another,” Philip Holzer,
deputy head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, told reporters in
Frankfurt today. “Merkel’s performance in the crisis was
received very positively internationally. The Americans are
increasingly constructive on Europe and the periphery.”  Merkel’s  Christian Democrats , who lead Germany’s largest
opposition party in polls ahead of the election this weekend,
have made fiscal austerity a condition of rescues of indebted
states amid efforts to preserve the euro. The European Central
Bank has also shored up confidence in the euro area by pledging
to buy sovereign bonds if states sign up to conditions.  “There was a certain standstill before the election,”
Hendrik Riehmer, managing partner of Hamburg-based Berenberg,
Germany’s oldest private bank, said at the joint briefing. “The
expectation is that the European process will improve,
especially with regard to the relationship between France and
Germany.”  The prospect of economic growth in Europe next year will
draw capital from  North America , Riehmer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
