Bahrain Telecommunications Co.’s
bonds declined, pushing the yields up the most in three months,
after Standard & Poor’s said the phone operator’s rating may be
cut to junk.  The yield on the 4.25 percent, $650 million bonds maturing
in May 2020 jumped 36 basis points, the most since June 24, to
6.18 percent at 2:11 p.m. in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. The
company known as Batelco sold the bonds in April to fund the
purchase of  Cable & Wireless Communications Plc (CWC) ’s Monaco and
islands businesses. S&P placed Batelco’s BBB- rating, the lowest
investment grade, on credit-watch negative.  Batelco is “suffering a greater loss of market share and
reduction in margins than we anticipated,” S&P analysts, led by
London-based Hina Shoeb, wrote in a research note today.
“Higher market competitiveness suggests to us that the
importance of Batelco’s role in Bahrain as a provider of key
communications infrastructure may be decreasing.”  The state-controlled company in December said it will buy
CWC’s business for $680 million as it sought to diversify from
the home market. Batelco reported a  22 percent drop  in first-half profit due to expenses linked to the acquisition and
related financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
