Gasoline slid to a nine-month low
as U.S. inventories of winter-grade gasoline are expected to
climb on lower demand for the motor fuel.  Futures fell as the Energy Information Administration may
report tomorrow that stockpiles rose 750,000 barrels last week,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. In the week ended Sept. 6, supplies of gasoline in PADD
3, which includes the Gulf Coast, were the highest seasonally in
weekly data begun in 1990, according to EIA data. The region is
home to 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity.  “Winter-grade gasoline margins were so good so early there
was an incentive to make a lot of it,” said Amrita Sen, chief
oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company
in  London . “So now there is a supply buffer.”  Gasoline for October delivery fell 3.55 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.6811 a gallon at 10:53 a.m. on trading volume
that was 2.8 percent above the 100-day average. Prices touched
$2.6758, the lowest intraday level since Dec. 18.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude narrowed 19 cents to $7.31 a barrel, after
finishing August at $13.73. The fuel’s  premium  over Brent,
gained 18 cents to $3.78, down from $7.37 on Aug. 30.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to $3.512 a
gallon, 35 cents below a year ago, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA
said today on its website. Prices have fallen 15 consecutive
days to the lowest level since July 9.  Ultra-low sulfur diesel slid to a five-week low as rising
European gasoil supplies and lower prices indicated less
opportunities for U.S. exports.  Distillate Inventories  ULSD fell as gasoil weakened on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Gasoil stockpiles in independent storage at Europe’s
Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil-trading hub rose 4.4 percent in
the week ended Sept. 12, according to PJK International BV. In
the U.S., distillate inventories probably rose 600,000 barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 10 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg.  “Overall, there are more supplies,” Sen said. “Chinese
companies seem to have received large export quotas for Q4, so
east-west flows on gasoil are also going to be higher.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for October delivery fell 4.91
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.0146 a gallon on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on trading volume that was 59 percent above
the 100-day average.  Gasoil for October delivery on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange fell to $930.25 a metric ton.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed $1.31 to $20.78 a
barrel. The  premium  over Brent fell 38 cents to $18.20.  The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to
report last week’s inventories at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in
 Washington . The report will probably show that gasoline
stockpiles increased 750,000 barrels last week, according to the
survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
