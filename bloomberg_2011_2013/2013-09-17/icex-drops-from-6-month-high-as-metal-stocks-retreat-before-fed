Russian stocks retreated from a
six-month high after oil sank and metal producers fell as
investors await signals from the U.S.  Federal Reserve  on
stimulus.  The Micex Index dropped 0.2 percent to 1,467.83 by 1:01
p.m. in Moscow after surging 2.1 percent yesterday to the
highest since March 15. OAO  Mechel (MTLR) ,  Russia ’s biggest producer of
coal for steelmakers, lost 1.4 percent to 110.40 rubles. OAO
Severstal, the country’s second-largest steelmaker, declined 0.7
percent to 296.10 rubles and dropped 0.9 percent to $9.175 in
London.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, traded down 0.5
percent to $106.08 in  New York , the third day of declines, as a
U.S. agreement with Russia on  Syria ’s chemical weapons eased the
threat of a U.S. strike. The Federal Reserve starts a two-day
policy meeting today, with economists predicting the central
bank will trim its monthly bond-buying program by $10 billion to
$75 billion.  “Metal stocks are some of the most sensitive to global
factors on the Russian market,” Kirill Chuyko, head of equity
research at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said by phone. “The
Russian market is very sensitive to the oil price, crude is
falling today.”  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  advanced an average 77 percent during the
Federal Reserve’s first two rounds of bond buying, and fell 0.6
percent in periods of no stimulus, the biggest difference of 46
emerging and developed markets tracked by Bloomberg. Fifty-seven
percent of investors surveyed in a Bloomberg Global Poll say
they don’t expect a sudden change in the markets if the Fed cuts
its bond purchases because they already anticipate tapering
action.  Steel Cut  Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc cut the Russian steel
sector to neutral, according to e-mailed notes today. Barclays
reduced Evraz Plc, OAO Novolipetsk Steel and Polymetal
International Plc to the equivalent of sell and lowered its
recommendation on the mining sector to negative, citing rich
valuations and weak fundamentals.  The Micex fell 0.7 percent on Sept. 13 as Russia’s central
bank kept the  refinancing rate  unchanged at 8.25 percent,
matching the forecast of 14 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Russia’s economy expanded 1.2 percent in the second
quarter, the Federal Statistics Service reported on Aug. 9,
missing the median forecast for 2 percent.  OAO Sberbank, the nation’s biggest lender, lost as much as
1.1 percent, trading down 0.5 percent at 98.54 rubles. Sberbank
accounted for about 45 percent of retail deposits in Russia as
of April 1.  Uralkali Retreats  OAO Uralkali dropped 1.6 percent to 186.12 rubles and
tumbled 2.1 percent to $28.73 in  London . The potash producer
surged to the highest since July yesterday as Russian
entrepreneur Vladimir Kogan was said to be seeking a stake.  Russian equities have the cheapest  valuations  among 21
emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg, with shares trading at
4.4 times 12-month estimated earnings, compared with a multiple
of 10.6 for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 20 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings rose to
22.203.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index retreated 0.6 percent to
1,427.95, after jumping to the highest since May 22 yesterday.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
stocks in New York rose 1.3 percent yesterday, the highest since
May 8, while  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, added 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
