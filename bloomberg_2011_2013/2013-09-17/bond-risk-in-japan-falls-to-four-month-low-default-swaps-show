The cost of insuring corporate
bonds from non-payment in Japan dropped, poised for the lowest
close in almost four months, credit-default swap traders said.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 2 basis points to 84
basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The benchmark, which has ranged from 74 basis points to
148.1 basis points this year, is set for its lowest close since
May 23, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index also decreased, by 1
basis point to 111 as of 10:08 a.m. in Sydney, according to
National Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The gauge, which has ranged
from 96.1 to 149.5 since Dec. 31, is poised to have fallen 13.5
basis points this month, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
private market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  was little changed at 131 basis points
as of 8:11 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The measure, which yesterday had its
biggest one-day drop in two months, is on track to decline 32.4
basis points this month, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
