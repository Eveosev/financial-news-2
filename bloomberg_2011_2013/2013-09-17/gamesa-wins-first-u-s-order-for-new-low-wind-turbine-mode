Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA,
 Spain â€™s biggest wind turbine maker, said it won its first U.S.
order for a new medium-and low-wind turbine model.  The order for 10 of its 2-megawatt G114 turbines is from
Heritage Sustainable Energy LLC for its Big Turtle wind farm in
northeast  Michigan , Gamesa said today in an e-mailed statement.
The devices are scheduled for delivery in mid-2014, with the
farm due to be commissioned by year-end, Gamesa said. The deal
includes a 12-year service agreement, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
