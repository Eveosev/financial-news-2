Treasury 10-year notes advanced for
a fifth day, the longest streak of gains in almost a year, on
speculation low inflation will give the Federal Reserve more
flexibility in winding down its government bond-buying program.  Benchmark  10-year note  yields approached the low for the
month after a Labor Department report showed the consumer-price
index increased 0.1 percent in August, the least in three
months. The Fed will reduce its purchases of bonds, including
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, to $80 billion a month
from $85 billion at its meeting tomorrow, according to a
Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “Inflation is way too low versus where the Fed is
targeting it,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed-income in New York
at Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc., one of the 21 primary
dealers that trade with the central bank. “It makes the case
that tapering will be smaller, but it doesn’t take tapering off
the table. The market is prepared for it and there’s no reason
to go back based on all the groundwork they’ve laid.”  The U.S. 10-year  yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.85 percent at 5 p.m. in New York after
falling to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since Aug. 30. The
2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face value, to 97. The five consecutive daily increases
is the longest streak since the period ended Sept. 26, 2012.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government debt, dropped 29 percent to
$299 billion from $419.5 billion yesterday. This year’s average
is $315.6 billion.  Tame Inflation  The CPI gained 0.2 percent in July. The median forecast in
a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.2 percent gain
in August. The core measure, which excludes food and fuel, also
rose 0.1 percent last month.  The yield on 0.375 percent TIPS due in July 2023 fell four
basis points to 0.69 percent. The U.S. is scheduled to sell $13
billion of the securities in two days.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-maturity TIPS, a gauge of expectations for consumer prices over
the life of the debt, rose three basis points to 2.17 percentage
points.  “The Fed is likely to mainly meet market expectations in
terms of tapering its asset-purchase program,” said Christopher Sullivan, who oversees $2.25 billion as chief investment officer
at the United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “We’re
likely to see the curve steepen from here. It’s likely that we
could see investors take advantage of any rally over the next
couple of days to exit.”  Summers Rally  Treasuries rose yesterday on speculation the withdrawal of
Lawrence Summers’s candidacy to be the next Fed chairman will
make the central bank less aggressive in tapering stimulus.  Investors in Treasuries were long this week, betting that
the prices of the securities will rise, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The proportion of net longs was at 8 percentage points in
the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan. Investors were
net short by 8 percentage points in the week ending Sept. 9.  The percent of outright longs, or bets the securities will
increase in value, rose to 21 percent, from 15 percent in the
week ended Sept. 9. The percent of outright shorts dropped to 13
percent from 23 percent. Investors raised neutral bets to 66
percent from 62 percent, the survey reported.  U.S. government securities have fallen 3.6 percent this
year through yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury
Bond Index. (BUSY)  They returned 2 percent last year.  Foreign Demand  “A lot of bond investors are more than willing to wait on
the sidelines and that brings in lower prices,” said Tom Tucci,
managing director and head of Treasury trading in New York at
CIBC World Markets Corp. “They are assuming tapering will lead
to higher rates. The question is ’what’s the Fed’s beginning of
tapering going to look like?’”  Foreign  holdings  of Treasuries declined by $10.5 billion or
0.2 percent in July to $5.6 trillion, the first four-month drop
since 2001, U.S. government data show. U.S. government
securities held by overseas investors have dropped 2.3 percent
since peaking at $5.72 trillion in March.  Holdings in  China , the largest foreign creditor to the
U.S., increased by $1.5 billion or 0.1 percent in July to $1.277
trillion. The Treasury has changed the way it collects data on
foreign holdings of U.S. government securities to reflect
custodial data and will no longer make revisions to the previous
month’s figures.  China’s Treasury position has risen $56.9 billion or 4.7
percent this year after a 5.9 percent increase in 2012. The
holdings declined 0.7 percent to $1.152 trillion in 2011, the
first annual decline on record going back to 2001.  Capital Inflow  Treasuries held by Japanese  investors , who have the second
largest stake in U.S. government debt, rose for the first time
in four months by $52 billion or 4.8 percent to a record $1.135
trillion. It was the largest increase since November 2011
following Japanese currency interventions earlier that year.
 Japan ’s holdings of U.S. government debt have dropped 4.3
percent since peaking at $1.132 trillion in October.  Net purchasing of long-term Treasuries by private foreign
investors was $49.8 billion compared with selling of a net $40.1
billion the prior month, the department said. Including short-term securities such as Treasury bills and stock swaps, the
total cross-border  inflow  was $56.7 billion in July, compared
with a $19.7 billion outflow the previous month, the report
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
