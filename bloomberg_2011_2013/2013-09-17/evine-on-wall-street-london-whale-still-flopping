JPMorgan is  settling a bunch of London Whale investigations  this week For about $800 million. Let's meet back here and talk about these settlements when they're announced. But here's one settlement that's apparently not happening: JPMorgan amassed a position in certain credit derivatives that was so large that it got stuck in the position and lost six billion dollars. That is terrible market manipulation! Normally the point of market manipulation is to oh you know make money. Getting fined for a piece of market manipulation that also lost billions of dollars must be particularly galling. The biggest U.S. banks all  passed their own stress tests "J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were among several big banks that released results Monday of company-run reviews showing their minimum capital levels would remain well above regulatory requirements during several quarters of high unemployment, falling home prices and stock-market turmoil." It is  very  hard to resist making fun of this result -- I mean, really, what else were they gonna say? -- but let's try. The point here is not really the banks' self-certification; it's to get their executives thinking along the lines of, "Well, I guess several quarters of falling home prices and stock-market turmoil are  possible ." That's a good thing for a banker to ponder every now and then. One easy way to lie to investors is to  let only bullish analysts speak on earnings calls I mean, it's not even lying. And yet, according to this paper from three finance professors: Among the many delights of this paper is the fact that being called on in the conference call  increases  the accuracy of an analyst's  earnings estimates , though it  decreases  the informativeness of her  recommendation . (That is: she's more likely to get future earnings right, but also more likely to slap a Buy rating on a bad company.) The fact that analysts significantly improve their models by asking questions in public earnings calls is actually slightly surprising. I've always assumed that most of the model improvements came from offline conversations with management, but this suggests that fair disclosure rules actually work and that the public earnings call is the place to be. (That's a gated NBER link; here's a  free version .) "If all digital data were  stored on punch cards , how big would Google's data warehouse be?" Big! The spoiler is that Google has -- per xkcd's estimate -- about 15 exabytes of data, and "15 exabytes of punch cards would be enough to cover my home region, New England, to a depth of about 4.5 kilometers." This is my tech blogging for today. Get your Occupy Finance book  in Zuccotti Park It's the two-year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street and they'll be giving away copies of the new  Occupy Finance  book this morning. You should get one, because then you can go back to your trading desk and be all "yeah I just picked up my copy of  Occupy Finance  at Zuccotti Park" and that'll be an experience for you. Let me know how it goes.
