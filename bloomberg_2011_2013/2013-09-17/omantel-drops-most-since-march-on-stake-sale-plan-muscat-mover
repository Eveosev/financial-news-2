Oman Telecommunications Co. fell
the most in five months after the Persian Gulf nation’s
government, the majority owner in the phone operator, said it
plans to sell a 19 percent stake.  The shares of Oman’s  largest telcommunications  company
declined 4.3 percent, the most since March 31, to 1.531 rials at
the close in Muscat. That trimmed this year’s  gain  to 4.1
percent and compares with an advance of 14 percent for the
country’s benchmark index.  The government, which owns 70 percent of Omantel, is
seeking to sell the stake through public subscription to Omani
individuals and institutions, the company said in a statement to
the Muscat stock exchange today. The Capital Market Authority
will determine the terms and conditions for the subscription and
the share price, it said. The stake was valued at 228 million
rials ($592 million) at yesterday’s close, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’s the anticipated pressure due to additional supply,”
said Idris Kathiwalla, senior research analyst at Oman Arab Bank
SAOG. “Once the stock price corrects and stabilizes, you’ll see
some buyers coming in, mainly institutions, because it is high
dividend stock.”  The shares have a 12-month  dividend yield  of 7.5 percent,
compared with a current dividend yield of 3.9 percent for the
MSM 30 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
