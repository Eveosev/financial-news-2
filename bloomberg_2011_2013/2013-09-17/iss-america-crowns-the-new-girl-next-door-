The story of India's contributions to the U.S. melting pot of cultures made a huge symbolic advance this week when Nina Davuluri, a 24-year-old New Yorker, became the first woman of Indian origin to claim the  Miss America title .  A measure of the significance of Davuluri's achievement was provided unintentionally by the hostile reactions of some Americans.  Bigoted remarks about Davuluri were soon making the rounds of Twitter (always an accurate if depressing window into the range and depth of prejudice). The offensive posts  charged  Davuluri, a second-generation American, with being an Arab or a Muslim -- apparently, crimes in themselves -- or with  looking  " like a terrorist ."  Some faces and skin tones, it would appear, are more American than others, or more deserving of winning beauty pageants. In such a world, Davuluri's achievement is all the more salutary. Of the many other possibilities and histories activated or renewed by Davuluri's victory, one might emphasize two. Her win points to the long history, at least a century old, of Indian striving in America, much of the time in conditions less hospitable, if not actively hostile, to immigrants. (For a full account of the Indian story in America, see Vinay Lal's " The Other Indians .") But Davuluri's consecration as an  American beauty icon  also points to a changing nation that is ever more hospitable to diversity. Davuluri herself elegantly pronounced on this theme, saying in  reply to a question  at the contest: "I’ve always viewed Miss America as the girl next door. And Miss America is always evolving." It was touching to see Davuluri's pride at being American, a point her detractors seemed to miss altogether. The idea of American culture renewing itself through dialogue with those once seen as outsiders was memorably articulated in 2000 by the Indian writer (and now long-time U.S. resident)  Amitava Kumar  when  he wrote  of the significance of Jhumpa Lahiri's stories of Bengali immigrants in Boston being awarded the Pulitzer Prize: This could just as well apply to Davuluri.  Sayu Bhojwani, New York City's first commissioner of immigrant affairs, took Davuluri's detractors to task in a piece titled " American citizens, but foreigners forever? ": Back in India, where many of the elders in Davuluri's family still reside, the news was greeted with excitement, but also a certain bemusement. Davuluri has said she intends to use her $50,000 prize to pay for medical school and follow in the footsteps of her parents, both doctors.  What, no dreams of Bollywood? After all, that's what beauty-pageant contestants in India aspire to. Whatever Davuluri's own ambitions, some producer in Mumbai is undoubtedly studying the nifty (and in an American context, daring) " classical Bollywood dance fusion " video of her performing at the Miss America contest, and thinking of the storyline best suited to bring her over to India -- probably one in which she plays herself on screen. And even as India celebrates "one of our own" making such a splash in America, it has much to learn from a story such as Davuluri's. Indian beauty pageants have a peculiar bias of their own: the country's  obsession with fair skin  and skin-whitening creams, which means that no dark-skinned woman can expect to come close to winning a beauty contest. This point was underscored by  Lakshmi Chaudhry  on the Indian website Firstpost.com, who wrote sarcastically that Davuluri was probably "too Indian" -- that is, too dark -- to ever be Miss India.
