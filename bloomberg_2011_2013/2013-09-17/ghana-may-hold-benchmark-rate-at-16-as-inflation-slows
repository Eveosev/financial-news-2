The  Bank of Ghana  will probably
leave its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged for a second
consecutive meeting after inflation slowed for the first time in
seven months in August.  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will maintain
the key lending rate at 16 percent, according to all nine
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The decision is scheduled to
be announced tomorrow at 11 a.m. in the capital, Accra.  “The moderation in the inflation rate in August and the
recent boost to the country’s gross international reserves
position, make room for the central bank to leave the rate
unchanged,” Ama Egyaba Baidu-Forson, a London-based economist
at IHS Global Insight, said yesterday in an e-mailed response to
questions.  Inflation slowed to 11.5 percent last month from 11.8
percent in July as consumer prices excluding food eased. Gross
foreign reserves rose to $5.6 billion, the central bank said in
August, after the country sold a $750-million Eurobond. That
compares with reserves worth $4.6 billion in May.  The Bank of  Ghana  held its policy rate at 16 percent, the
highest in more than two years, in July to support the cedi,
which has dropped 12.6 percent against the dollar this year. The
currency traded unchanged for the sixth consecutive day at 2.18
per dollar by 7:43 a.m. in Accra.  “The main stress point in the economy remains the ongoing
exchange rate weakness, and as such reducing interest rates
would send a negative signal to the market,”  Samir Gadio , an
 emerging markets  strategist at Standard Bank Plc in  London , said
yesterday by e-mail.
