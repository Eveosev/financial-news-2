Bethpage State Park’s Black Course,
the public layout on  New York ’s Long Island that hosted U.S.
Open golf tournaments in 2002 and 2009, was picked as the site
for the 2019  PGA Championship  and the 2024 Ryder Cup.  The announcement from the PGA of America comes more than a
month after  Jason Dufner ’s two-stroke win at this year’s PGA,
the last of the season’s four major tournaments, at Oak Hill
Country Club outside Rochester, New York.  The Ryder Cup, the men’s biennial team competition between
the U.S. and Europe that started in 1927, never has been played
on Long Island, which is home to eight clubs in Golf Digest’s
list of the top 100 U.S. courses.  Bethpage Black , a public
course in Farmingdale, New York, ranks 42nd.  “To be able to bring two of the most popular events in
golf, two of the most exciting events in sports, to Bethpage
State Park, it’s amazing to think about that,” Pete Bevacqua,
chief executive officer of the PGA of America, said in a
televised news conference. “To combine the energy of the Ryder
Cup with the energy of Bethpage State Park, the state of New
York and New York sports fans is really exciting.”  Keegan Bradley, the 2011 PGA Championship winner, said on
Twitter last month that the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black “will
be insane.”  Graeme McDowell , the 2010 U.S. Open champion from
Northern Ireland, said on his Twitter feed that the crowds for
the event “will be loud and crazy.”  The U.S. Golf Association, which runs the Open, said it
didn’t have attendance figures for the tournaments.  Mickelson Fan  Phil Mickelson  finished second to  Tiger Woods  at the 2002
U.S. Open at Bethpage Black and has said the crowds at that
tournament were louder than just about anything he’s experienced
on the U.S.  PGA Tour . Last year’s first PGA Tour playoff event,
the Barclays, was also played at Bethpage Black.  The PGA Championship hasn’t been held on Long Island since
1939, when it was conducted as a match-play event and Henry Picard needed 37 holes to beat Byron Nelson at the old Pomonok
Country Club in Flushing.  “New York and the PGA of America have been intertwined
since our founding,” PGA President Ted Bishop said. “This
course, this place, this city is going to take the Ryder Cup
somewhere it’s never been before.”  Future sites for the PGA Championship had been set through
2018, with Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville,  Kentucky , hosting
next year’s tournament. Other sites are Whistling Straits in
Kohler, Wisconsin, in 2015; Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield,
 New Jersey , in 2016; Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte,  North
Carolina , in 2017; and Bellerive Country Club in Town and
Country, Missouri, in 2018.  The Ryder Cup was last contested in New York in 1995 at Oak
Hill, which is about 5 1/2 hours northwest of New York City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
