Volga Gas Plc (VGAS) , a Russia-focused oil
and gas explorer, will eventually double output after completing
the upgrade of a processing plant in the third quarter.  Production will initially rise to more than 4,000 barrels a
day, from 2,550 barrels in the first half, before expanding to
7,000 barrels in the medium term, the company said today in a
statement. The upgrade will be finished in the third quarter, as
planned, Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Ivanov told Bloomberg.  The exploration company posted a first-half profit of $3.4
million, after a $5.6 million loss a year earlier, while sales
grew 15.8 percent to $15.4 million, according to the statement.  The completion of work at the southern Russian plant by
Volga Gas, controlled by Baring Vostok Capital Partners, will
allow for greater development of the company’s gas licenses in
the area and follows an earlier upgrade to the site last year.  “We expect to more than double gas and condensate
production from our existing wells,” Ivanov said in today’s
statement. “We plan further exploration on our existing
licenses and will continue actively to search for opportunities
to expand the Group’s operations” through acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
