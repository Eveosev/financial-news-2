Retail sales are projected to
advance 2.4 percent this holiday season, the smallest increase
since 2009, as shoppers visit fewer stores.  Customer traffic in November and December may decline 1.4
percent from the same period a year earlier, ShopperTrak, a
Chicago-based researcher, said in a statement today. Holiday
sales have risen at least 3 percent after declining 1.2 percent
in 2009 and 6.2 percent in 2008 amid the recession.  Retailers may begin offering promotions for holiday
shopping as early as Nov. 1 this year to take advantage of a
shorter shopping season, ShopperTrak estimates. This year there
are 25 days between Black Friday and Christmas compared with 31
in 2012, and four instead of five weekends. Hanukkah starts 11
days earlier than last year.  “Everybody’s kind of battening down the hatches to prepare
for a knock-down, drag-out fight for sales,”  Dorothy Lakner , a
New York-based analyst at Topeka Capital Markets, said today in
a phone interview. “Are retailers going to be promotional? Yes.
Will they start early? Yes, that’s probably true, too.”  Holiday sales and store shopper activity account for about
20 percent of annual retail activity, ShopperTrak said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
