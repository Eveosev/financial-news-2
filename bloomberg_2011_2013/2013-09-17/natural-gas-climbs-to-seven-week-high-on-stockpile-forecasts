Natural gas futures advanced to a
seven-week high in New York on speculation that government data
this week will show a below-normal gain in inventories of the
power-plant fuel.  Gas climbed as much as 1 percent as a Sept. 19 report from
the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration may
show that stockpiles rose by 59 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Sept. 13, compared with the five-year average gain of 74
billion, according to the median of five analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Traders are expecting a smaller-than-average storage
injection and that’s been supportive for prices,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market continues to try to push
higher.”  Natural gas for October delivery rose 1.2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $3.75 per million British thermal units at 9:42 a.m.
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier climbing to
$3.776, the highest intraday price since July 24. Trading volume
was 26 percent above the 100-day average. Prices are up 12
percent this year.  The discount of October to November futures was steady at
7.6 cents. October gas traded 30.3 cents below the January
contract, unchanged from yesterday.  October $3.50 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 0.2 cent lower at 0.6 cent per
million Btu on volume of 504 at 9:45 a.m. Puts accounted for 61
percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for October at-the-money options was 29.84 percent at 9:30 a.m., compared with
29.12 percent yesterday  Gas Stockpiles  Gas inventories totaled 3.253 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Sept. 6, 1.4 percent above the five-year average and
5 percent below year-earlier supplies, EIA data show.  MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said the
weather may be warmer than normal in most of the lower-48 states
through Oct. 1.  The high in  Chicago  on Sept. 19 may be 85 degrees
Fahrenheit (29 Celsius), 11 more than usual, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in State College,  Pennsylvania . The high in
Houston may be 91 degrees, 3 above normal.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  An area of low pressure over Belize and the southern
Yucatan Peninsula may drift over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico
later in the week, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said
in an 8 a.m.  outlook . The system has a 50 percent chance of
becoming a tropical cyclone during the next five days.  The Gulf of  Mexico  will account for 5.6 percent of U.S. gas
production this year, EIA data show.  The U.S. met 87 percent of its own energy needs in the
first five months of 2013, on pace to be the highest annual rate
since 1986, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
