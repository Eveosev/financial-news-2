Banco de Chile  rose after Deutsche
Bank AG said profits at the country’s largest lender by assets
will rise as inflation quickens in the second half of the year.  The shares gained 1.3 percent to 77.14 pesos in Santiago,
the highest closing price since Sept. 11. The IPSA benchmark
index fell 0.4 percent.  Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation to buy from hold
and set a price target for  Banco de Chile (CHILE)  of $104 per American
depositary receipt from $96, citing expectations of faster
inflation in the second half of the year. Chilean banks hold
inflation-indexed instruments whose value gains when consumer
prices increase.  “In addition to an expected pick-up in inflation boosting
second-half results, we think underlying operating trends should
remain healthy through 2014 with less risk than other banks in
the region,” analysts Tito Labarta and  Mario Pierry  said in an
e-mailed report.  Deutsche Bank also raised  Banco Santander Chile (BSAN)  to buy from
hold.  Analysts expect consumer prices will rise 1.8 percent in
Chile this year and 3 percent in 2014, according to estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. In the 12 months through May, prices rose
0.9 percent, below the central bank’s target range of 3 percent
plus or minus one percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
