It looks a lot different from this side: Bill Daley, who played a major part in Democratic presidential campaigns and his brother's mayoral races in Chicago, hated the role of candidate which is why he  dropped out  of the Illinois gubernatorial Democratic primary today. Staying in strange hotels, incessantly raising money and soliciting support from politicians who wanted commitments for jobs for their relatives if he won, Daley told close associates, was a miserable experience.  Daley calculated that it would be a bad outcome if he lost -- Daleys don't lose races -- and at 65 years old, if he won, he would be a candidate and political figure until old age. Fund-raisers were scheduled and support was lining up when he abruptly pulled out. (Albert R. Hunt is a Bloomberg View columnist. Follow him on  Twitter .)
