Oman’s government, the largest
shareholder in Oman Telecommunications Co., plans to sell a 19
percent stake in the nation’s biggest phone operator.  The government, which holds 70 percent, is seeking to sell
the stake through public subscription to Omani individuals and
institutions, the company said in a statement to the Muscat
stock exchange today. The Capital Market Authority will
determine the terms and conditions for the subscription and the
share price after the government completes procedures to float
shares and appoint a consultant, it said.  The state’s 19 percent stake is valued at 221 million rials
($574 million), according to Bloomberg calculations based on
Omantel’s market value. The shares have lagged the benchmark  MSM
30 Index (MSM30)  this year, climbing 5.4 percent compared with a 14
advance for the measure.  The stock fell  3.1 percent to 1.55 rials at 10:28 am in
Muscat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
