Asian  stocks  fell, with the
benchmark regional index declining from a four-month high, as
the U.S. Federal Reserve begins a two-day policy meeting at
which it’s forecast to reduce the pace of bond buying.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s biggest technology company,
sank 2.7 percent in Seoul, retreating from the highest level
since May.  Daiichi Sankyo Co. (4568) , which owns 64 percent of Ranbaxy
Laboratories Ltd., tumbled 6.8 percent in Tokyo after U.S.
regulators restricted imports from one of the Indian drugmaker’s
facilities.  Wing Hang Bank Ltd. (302)  soared a record 39 percent in
Hong Kong after saying shareholders were approached for a
takeover bid.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slipped 0.4 percent to 138.19
as of 6:02 p.m. in Hong Kong as all 10 industry groups on the
gauge declined. The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets today
and tomorrow to consider whether to taper its $85 billion-a-month in bond buying. Purchases will probably be cut by $10
billion, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  “Tapering is coming, but it’s only going to be small,”
Kerry Series, Sydney-based chief investment officer at Eight
Investment Partners, told Bloomberg TV. “There is an economic
recovery under way in the U.S., but it’s fragile. The
combination of low valuations, easy monetary policy and
reasonable earnings growth across the region means markets will
want to go higher.” His Asia-Pacific fund beat 89 percent of
peers, rising 39 percent in the past year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Regional Gauges  South Korea’s  Kospi index  retreated 0.4 percent as Samsung
dragged the country’s benchmark lower. Shares of the electronics
maker slid 2.7 percent to 1.386 million won. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index sank 0.3 percent and China’s Shanghai Composite Index
dropped 2.1 percent.  Japan’s  Topix index  slid 0.3 percent as the equity market
reopened after a holiday. Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped 0.1
percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  rose 0.1 percent to close
at a five-year high. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.1
percent to a record. Singapore’s Straits Times Index was little
changed.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index’s 6.8 percent rally in 2013 has
lagged a 19 percent surge in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
amid concern economic growth in China is slowing. The Asia-Pacific measure trades at 13.5 times  estimated earnings ,
compared with a multiple of 15.4 for the  S&P 500  and 14.2 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Fed Leadership  The Asia-Pacific index climbed to a four-month high
yesterday after former Treasury Secretary  Lawrence Summers 
withdrew his bid to be the next Fed chairman.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia said it retains the option of
reducing  interest rates  and a further decline in the currency
would aid the economy as resource investment slows, minutes of
the central bank’s Sept. 3 meeting showed. Governor  Glenn
Stevens  and his board left the benchmark interest rate at a
record-low 2.5 percent at that meeting.  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
yesterday came within five points of its record high on Aug. 2.  The U.S. benchmark measure has rallied for nine of 10
sessions this month, rising 4 percent to rebound from the worst
monthly loss since May 2012, as reports showed  China’s economy 
strengthened and the U.S. looked less likely to attack Syria.  Import Restrictions  Daiichi Sankyo lost 6.8 percent to 1,772 yen as U.S.
regulators restricted imports from a factory of its Indian unit
Ranbaxy Laboratories. The plant would have been used to make a
majority of generic drugs that Ranbaxy was filing for U.S.
approval, including Diovan, according to Cantor Fitzgerald LP,
referring to a blood-pressure pill that generated $4.4 billion
in sales for Novartis AG last year.  Wing Hang Bank soared 40 percent to HK$116.80. The firm
joins other lenders such as Chong Hing Bank Ltd. in acquisition
talks as Hong Kong’s role as an international  yuan  center
attracts mainland financial institutions that are seeking to
expand overseas.  Nippon Yakin Kogyo Co. (5480)  climbed 9.6 percent to 307 yen in
Tokyo after starting contract production for a unit of Japan’s
biggest steelmaker.  Sharp Corp. rallied 6.6 percent to 370 yen. The Nikkei
newspaper reported the TV maker will increase its earnings
forecast and announce a share sale tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
