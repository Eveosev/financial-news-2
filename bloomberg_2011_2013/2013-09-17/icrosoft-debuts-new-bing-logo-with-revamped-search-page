Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)  isn’t the only Web
property with a new look.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ’s Bing search engine
is unveiling today a revamped website with a redesigned logo.  The brand features a simpler typeface “created to be
simple, real and direct” that better matches the font used on
other Microsoft products, Scott Erickson, senior director, brand
and creative at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post. The company
also changed how it displays search results, moving from three
columns to two.  Microsoft has been rolling out changes to Bing about twice
a year and last unveiled a new design in May 2012, seeking to
attract more search users and narrow the gap with  Google Inc. (GOOG) 
The No. 1 software maker is undergoing a management transition
and struggling to break into mobile devices as users shift away
from personal computers, while keeping up investment in Web
services.  Microsoft had 17.9 percent of the search market in August,
up one percentage point from March, according to  ComScore Inc. (SCOR) 
Google leads with a 66.9 percent share, while Yahoo trails both
at 11.4 percent.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington , said in July that
its online-services business, largely advertising revenue from
Bing and other online properties,  posted  an operating loss of
$1.28 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30.  Over the last several years, Microsoft has been altering
the design of its product names to be more in line with each
other, with a cleaner and sleeker style.  Yahoo introduced a new logo earlier this month, seeking to
refresh its image.  To contact the reporter on this story:
