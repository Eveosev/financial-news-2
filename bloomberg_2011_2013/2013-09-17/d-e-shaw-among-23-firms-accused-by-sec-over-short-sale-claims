D.E. Shaw & Co., the $30 billion
hedge fund, was among 23 investment firms accused by U.S.
regulators of improperly buying shares of companies they had bet
against days earlier.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, in administrative
actions announced today, said the firms violated rule 105, which
prohibits taking part in a public offering after selling the
stock short during a restricted period prior to the pricing of
the sale. The actions are being settled by 22 of the 23 firms
for a total of more than $14.4 million, the SEC said.  Rule 105 helps prevent short selling that can reduce the
proceeds received by companies by depressing the market price
shortly before the company prices its public offering. Firms
that violate the rule typically reap illicit profits by buying
the shares at an artificially low price, the SEC said.  “The benchmark of an effective enforcement program is zero
tolerance for any securities law violations, including
violations that do not require manipulative intent,” Andrew Ceresney, co-chief of SEC enforcement, said in a statement.  D.E. Shaw, based in New York, agreed to pay about $667,000
to resolve the claims without admitting or denying wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
