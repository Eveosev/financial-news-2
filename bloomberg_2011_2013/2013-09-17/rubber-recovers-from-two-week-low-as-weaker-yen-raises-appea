Rubber rebounded from a two-week
low as the Japanese currency weakened against the dollar amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may taper stimulus, increasing
the appeal of the yen-denominated futures.  The contract for February delivery on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 1.3 percent to 275.6 yen a kilogram
($2,776 a metric ton) and was at 274.7 yen at 11:06 a.m. Earlier,
the most-active contract slid to 268.4 yen, the lowest since
Sept. 2. Prices lost 3.8 percent last week.  The yen depreciated to 99.28 per dollar after reaching the
strongest level in two weeks yesterday. The  Federal Open Market
Committee  will slow its monthly asset purchases to $75 billion
from $85 billion at a two-day meeting that starts today,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  “The focus is on whether the Fed will decide to curtail
its stimulus and how the  currency market  will react to a
decision,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  The contract for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange added 0.9 percent to 20,280  yuan  ($3,313) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board lost 0.9 percent to 82.7 baht ($2.60) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
