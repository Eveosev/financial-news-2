John Brody has stepped down as the National Football League’s vice president of sponsorship and media sales after seven months in the position, according to an internal NFL memo obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Brody joined the NFL in February and was responsible for developing national partnerships tied to the NFL brand and leveraging media assets.  Before coming to the NFL, Brody had been with Wasserman Media Group since 2010 as a managing director of the company’s partnership and business development division. In that role, he helped secure a naming rights deal between  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and the  New York  Giants’ and Jets’ new stadium.  The NFL is splitting the sponsorship and media sales departments, according to the memo. Brody will work with the league through the transition, it said.  Brody also spent 12 years with  Major League Baseball , including the last seven as senior vice president of the corporate sales and marketing division, and two years as chief marketing officer for the National Basketball Association’s Boston Celtics.
