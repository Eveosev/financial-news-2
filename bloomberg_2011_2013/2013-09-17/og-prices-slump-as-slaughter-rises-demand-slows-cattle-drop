Hog futures declined the most in
almost three weeks on signs of increasing U.S. pork supplies and
slowing demand. Cattle also fell.  Wholesale  pork  slumped 1.5 percent to 96.71 cents a pound
yesterday, the biggest drop since Aug. 30, government data show.
Meatpackers processed 428,000 hogs yesterday, up 2.6 percent
from a week earlier, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates.  “Everyone is concerned about the numbers,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview.
“Slaughter numbers are up significantly. A big concern is we’ve
got the weaker-product market to start off the week.”  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.5 percent to
88.075 cents a pound at 10:15 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, heading for the biggest decline for the most-active
contract since Aug. 28.  Cattle futures for December delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$1.2845 a pound on the CME. The contract was down 4.8 percent
this year through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement dropped 0.8
percent to $1.5815 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
