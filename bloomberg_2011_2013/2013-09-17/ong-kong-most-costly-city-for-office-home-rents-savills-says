Hong Kong is the most expensive
city in the world to rent business and residential space,
according to a report by  Savills Plc. (SVS)   New York  displaced  London  as the world’s second-most
expensive city in the first half of 2013, the World Cities
Review, which measures costs in the world’s 10 leading cities,
released today showed. New York was ranked fifth at the
beginning of 2010, the London-based property broker said.  Hong Kong’s home  prices  have more than doubled since early
2009 to a record, raising concerns of an asset bubble and
stoking public discontent. The city also has the world’s most
expensive retail rents and its Central business district was the
costliest district to rent an office until it was overtaken by
London’s West End at the end of 2012, according to Cushman &
Wakefield Inc.  It would cost $1.63 million per year for a 14-person team
to set up in  Hong Kong , the most expensive, according to Savills
Executive Unit, a core business unit measure the broker uses to
compare costs across cities. New York came second with $1.55
million and London third with $1.53 million, according to the
report. Total costs are calculated for two teams of seven people
each, one located in a prime financial location, while the other
is in a secondary area, Savills said.  Singapore offered businesses locating there the best-value
accommodation in relation to the size of its economy, Savills
said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
