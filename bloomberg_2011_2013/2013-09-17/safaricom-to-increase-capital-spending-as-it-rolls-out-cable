Safaricom Ltd.,  Kenya ’s biggest
company by market value, plans to increase capital expenditure
by 8 percent for the fiscal year through March as it extends
cable to meet demand for Internet access.  “We have to continue investing in infrastructure,” Bob Collymore, chief executive officer of the mobile-phone company,
said today in an interview on the sidelines of an International
Monetary Fund conference in the capital, Nairobi.  Capital spending in the year will rise to 27 billion
shillings ($309 million) from 25 billion shillings, Collymore
said. Kenya’s data usage and penetration is expected to overtake
that of  Egypt  in five years, mostly driven by investment in
fiber-optic networks and lower pricing per data unit, he said.  Safaricom, 40 percent owned by  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD) , said
last month it had begun laying 6,000 kilometers of fiber-optic
cable to connect more people to the Internet and fixed phone
services. Kenyan Internet users increased 11.6 percent to 16.2
million in the fourth quarter through December from the previous
three months.  Safaricom rose 0.6 percent to 8.15 shillings by the close
of trading in Nairobi. The shares have gained 61 percent this
year, beating the 26 percent rise of the FTSE NSE Kenya 25
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
