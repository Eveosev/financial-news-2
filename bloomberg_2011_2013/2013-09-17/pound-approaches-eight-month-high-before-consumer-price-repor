U.K. 10-year government bonds fell
for the first time in five days before the Bank of England
releases the minutes of its September policy meeting tomorrow.  Benchmark  10-year yields  rose toward the highest level
since July 2011, having climbed about half a percentage point
since  Mark Carney  became central bank governor on July 1 and
introduced a policy of interest-rate guidance. The extra yield
investors demand to hold 10-year gilts instead of equivalent
U.S. Treasuries widened for the first time in four days. The
pound was little changed after a government report showed
inflation slowed in August.  “Investors are demanding a higher premium on gilts
compared to Treasuries,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh. The market
remains uncertain about “how the BOE sets monetary policy over
the medium term.”  The 10-year  gilt yield  rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.94 percent at 4:32 p.m.  London  time after
increasing to 3.05 percent on Sept. 11, the highest since July
27, 2011. The 2.25 percent bond due September 2023 fell 0.51, or
5.10 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,590) face amount, to 94.05.  Bank of England  officials provided an assessment of forward
guidance last month and said they won’t raise borrowing costs
until unemployment falls to 7 percent. While they don’t see that
happening until late 2016, signs of strength in the economy have
prompted investors to bet on an earlier increase.  Extra Yield  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity Treasuries increased seven basis
points to nine basis points.  Fed policy makers meeting today and tomorrow will lower the
monthly pace of bond purchases by $10 billion, to $75 billion,
according to the median response of 34 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey on Sept. 6.  Gilts lost 4.4 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German securities
dropped 2.3 percent and Treasuries declined 3.6 percent.  The pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.5899 after climbing as
much as 0.3 percent. The U.K. currency weakened 0.1 percent to
83.96 pence per euro.  Consumer prices increased 2.7 percent from a year earlier,
compared with 2.8 percent in July, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London.  Producer prices  gained 1.6 percent
from last year, after climbing 2.1 percent the previous month, a
separate report showed.  ‘Data Outperforming’  “The data was in line with economist expectations, but the
market has become accustomed to U.K. data outperforming,” said
 Neil Jones , head of hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd.
in London  The U.K. 10-year  break-even rate , a gauge of market
inflation expectations derived from the difference in yield
between gilts and index-linked securities, widened five basis
points to 3.08 percentage points after shrinking to 3.03
percentage points yesterday, the narrowest since Aug. 27.  The pound rose earlier following the U.K. government’s sale
of a 3.2 billion-pound stake in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , a
first step toward full private ownership of Britain’s largest
mortgage lender.  “There’s a lot of optimism surrounding the U.K. recovery
right now and that’s the main driver for sterling,” said Jane Foley, a London-based senior currency strategist at Rabobank
International. “We haven’t been given much information on
whether the Lloyd’s sale has gone overseas or not, but in a way
that’s another bit of news that’s supporting a trend that’s
already there.”  The pound has risen 6.6 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar gained 0.7
percent and the euro advanced 3.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
