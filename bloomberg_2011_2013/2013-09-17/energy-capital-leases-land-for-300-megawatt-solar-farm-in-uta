Energy Capital Group LLC, a Provo,
Utah-based renewable-power developer, leased about 1,750 acres
for a 300-megawatt solar farm it’s planning to build in western
 Utah .  The company is pursuing deals to sell the power, Chief
Executive Officer Josh Case said in an interview today. The
$600-million ECG Utah Solar 1 project will generate enough
energy for about 80,000 homes, according to a statement today.  Energy Capital won’t select a panel supplier or begin
construction until it completes a power-purchase agreement. The
project is also awaiting a conditional use permit from Millard
County, Utah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
