Cocoa dropped from a one-year high
in  New York  on speculation of investor sales to profit from this
year’s best-performing commodity. Sugar and coffee fell.  Cocoa gained 18 percent in  London  and 17 percent in New
York this year. The beans become the best performer in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials yesterday,
beating crude. Money managers held record bets on rising cocoa
prices in both London and New York in the week ended Sept. 10,
data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
NYSE Liffe exchange compiled by Bloomberg show.  “One potentially bearish risk we see in the short term is
the very large net speculative length on the cocoa futures
markets,”  Kona Haque , a London-based agricultural commodities
analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd., said in a report e-mailed
today. “At over 35 percent of total open interest, clearly
funds have been a key driver in pushing prices higher.”  Cocoa for December delivery dropped 0.6 percent to $2,621 a
metric ton by 7:04 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
touching $2,648 a ton, the highest since Sept. 17 last year.
Cocoa for delivery in the same month fell 0.6 percent to 1,712
pounds ($2,724) a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Net Long  Speculators held a net-long position, or a bet on higher
prices, of 65,264 contracts on ICE, the  biggest on record , data
from the Washington-based commission showed. In London, money
managers were  net-long  by 61,644 futures and options, the most
since the exchange started publishing the data in 2011.  Cocoa accelerated gains the past two months, and there are
“increasingly dismal prospects for the next crop due to the
prolonged absence of sufficient rainfall in West Africa,”
 Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said
in a report e-mailed today.  Raw sugar for delivery in March fell 0.4 percent to 17.46
cents a pound in New York. White sugar for December delivery
slid 0.4 percent to $483.80 a ton in London.  Arabica coffee for December delivery declined 0.1 percent
to $1.1915 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for delivery in
November dropped 0.4 percent to $1,724 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
