Indonesia’s rupiah forwards fell
the most in three weeks and  government bonds  declined before the
 Federal Reserve  starts a meeting today to decide whether to cut
stimulus that has buoyed demand for emerging-market assets.  The U.S. central bank will probably reduce its bond
purchases to $75 billion a month, from $85 billion currently,
according to a Bloomberg survey this month.  Global funds  pulled
790 billion rupiah ($70 million) from local-currency government
bonds this month through Sept. 11, finance ministry data show.
 Bank Indonesia  raised its policy rate by 1.5 percentage points
in the last three months to help narrow the  current-account
deficit , which was a record $9.8 billion in the second quarter.  “The outlook for the rupiah, as with other emerging-market
currencies, is really dependent on how much the Fed is going to
do,” said Irene Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  in Singapore. “We
still need to see an improvement in the external balance
numbers.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards slid 1.6 percent
to 11,388 per dollar as of 9:28 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest
drop since Aug. 27, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts traded 0.4 percent stronger than the spot rate, which
fell 0.4 percent to 11,418, according to prices from local banks.
The forwards have traded 3.3 percent weaker on average than the
spot rate over the past month.  One-month implied volatility on the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose
16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 17.53 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. A  fixing  used to settle the
rupiah forwards was set at 11,101 per dollar yesterday,
according to the Association of Banks in Singapore.  The yield on the 5.625 percent bonds due May 2023 climbed
eight basis points to 8.11 percent, according to prices from the
Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
