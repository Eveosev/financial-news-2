Coffee farmers in  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing region of the world’s third-biggest robusta producer, harvested 92 percent of this year’s
crop, according to Amsterdam-based trader  Nedcoffee BV .  While all beans from the lowlands had been gathered by
Sept. 6, farmers in highlands collected 65 percent of the crop,
the trader, which has a factory in the Southeast Asian nation
with storage capacity of 300,000 bags, said in a report e-mailed
today. About 70 percent of the beans harvested were sold by
farmers and middlemen, it said. Indonesia is in its 2013-14
season. A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  In  Vietnam , the world’s largest robusta grower, farmers
were still holding 9 percent of the crop by Sept. 1, or 139,114
tons, said Nedcoffee, which also has offices in  Ho Chi Minh
City , Vietnam. Bean stockpiles held by traders fell 32,000 tons
last month. Vietnam’s 2012-13 season ends Sept. 30 and
harvesting of the next crop is set to start next month.  “The weather remains ideal for new crop development, with
good sunshine in the daytime alternating with downpours during
the night,” Nedcoffee said. “Cherries are maturing well.”  While the first red cherries have already been picked by
farmers, the majority of the new crop “will only come from
December,” said the trader. Vietnam may have 80,000 tons of
coffee to export this month if carryover stockpiles are the same
as last season’s, according to the report.  Robusta coffee for delivery in November fell 2.3 percent to
$1,691 a ton by 3:27 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
