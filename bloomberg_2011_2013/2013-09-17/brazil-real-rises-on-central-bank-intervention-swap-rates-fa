Brazil ’s real climbed for the first
time in three days as the central bank prepared to roll over
foreign-exchange swap contracts to support the currency in an
effort to curb inflation.  The real appreciated 0.5 percent to 2.2721 per U.S. dollar
at 9:55 a.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level on a closing
basis since Aug. 9. Swap rates on contracts maturing in January
2015 declined three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
10.41 percent.  The currency has rallied 7.3 percent since Aug. 22, when
the central bank announced a $60 billion intervention program of
currency swaps and foreign-exchange credit lines through the end
of the year. Today’s rollover of currency swaps is in addition
to an auction of new contracts.  “The central bank doesn’t want the real to weaken, and
that has been the global trend against the dollar,”  Eduardo Suarez , a currency strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia , said in a
telephone interview from Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
