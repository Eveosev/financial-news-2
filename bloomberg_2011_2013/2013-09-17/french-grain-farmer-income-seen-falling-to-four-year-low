French grain farmers’ income may
slump to the lowest in four years on lower wheat prices and
rising input costs, according to the country’s wheat producers
association AGPB.  Average pretax earnings for grain and oilseed growers may
fall as low as 15,000 euros ($20,043) in 2013 from an estimated
72,000 euros last year, according to documents handed out at a
news conference organized by the  AGPB  in Paris today.  “The black spot on this year will definitely be the
revenue,” Philippe Pinta, president of commodity-crop
federation Orama, which includes the AGPB, said at the event.
“It’ll be to the tune of 15,000 to 30,000 euros.”  Soft wheat prices paid to French growers at the farm gate
are expected to be about 165 euros a metric ton this year from
215 euros in 2012, the lowest level in four years, based on
estimates by the AGPB.  Based on the expected income range, farm income for grain
and oilseed growers will be the lowest since 2009, when average
income was 10,000 euros. Wheat prices paid at the farm gate fell
to 109 euros a ton that year, AGPB data show.  Milling wheat traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris for delivery in
November has slumped 19 percent in the past 12 months to 185.75
euros a ton.  The average cost of growing a ton of soft wheat in  France 
in 2013 was about 200 euros, or 170 euros after the inclusion of
European Union farm subsidies, according to Pinta. That estimate
includes earnings for the farmer set at 150 percent of the
minimum wage, he said.  “Data coming out of the field indicate that the costs per
hectare of the 2013 wheat harvest surpass the 2012 level,
therefore setting a new record,” the AGPB wrote in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
