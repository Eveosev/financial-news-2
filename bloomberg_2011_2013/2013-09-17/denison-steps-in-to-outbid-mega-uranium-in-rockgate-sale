(Corrects terms of stock exchange in second paragraph of
story published Sept. 17.)  Denison Mines Corp. (DML) , the Canadian
uranium miner with stakes in the U.S., Canada, Mongolia and
Zambia, plans to counter  Mega Uranium Ltd. (MGA) ’s bid and offer
C$26.7 million ($25.9 million) for  Rockgate Capital Corp. (RGT)   For each share they own, Rockgate holders would get 0.192
of a Denison share, valued at 23 Canadian cents, or 47 percent
more than yesterday’s closing price, the Toronto-based company
said in a statement today. Mega, a Toronto-based company with a
mine in Australia, announced last month it would acquire
Rockgate.  Denison Chief Executive Officer Ron Hochstein said some
Rockgate investors were unhappy with Mega Uranium’s offer.
Denison “welcomed the opportunity given by key Rockgate
shareholders to assist in undertaking this offer,” he said in
the statement.  Rockgate’s Falea project in  Mali  will add to Denison’s
Africa portfolio, which it plans to eventually spin off into its
own company, said Hochstein.  Rockgate mines copper and uranium. The shares rose 32
percent to 21 Canadian cents at the close in Toronto. Vancouver-based Rockgate has fallen 61 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
