Palm oil  gained for a third day on
speculation that rising exports from  Malaysia , the world’s
second-biggest producer, may pare stockpiles.  The contract for delivery in December, with the biggest
open interest and volume, climbed 0.4 percent to 2,355 ringgit
($726) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives. Palm oil
for physical delivery this month was at 2,370 ringgit, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from Malaysia rose 14 percent to 732,412 tons in
the first 15 days of September from the same period in August,
independent surveyor Intertek said today. The country left the
tax on exports of crude palm oil unchanged for an eighth month
in October to encourage shipments and prevent a build-up in
stockpiles during the peak output season.  “The export data has been positive for the market,” said
Prasoon Mathur, senior manager at Religare Commodities Ltd.
“The concerns about the rising output in Malaysia are limiting
the rise in prices.”  Output climbed to 1.74 million tons in August, the highest
level since December and stockpiles were at 1.67 million tons,
according to data from the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  Soybeans for November gained 0.7 percent to $13.57 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  for December delivery
was little changed at 42.35 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery gained 0.4 percent to
5,412  yuan  ($885) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil rose to 7,102 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
