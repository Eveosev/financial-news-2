Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt 
said Sweden won’t reach its surplus target until 2017 as the
governments stimulates the largest Nordic economy to boost  job
creation .  “To secure a stable development and lower unemployment
it’s reasonable to return to a surplus of 1 percent of GDP only
when resource utilization nears balance,” he said yesterday in
a speech at the opening of the Stockholm parliament’s 2013/2014
session. “This is expected according to our forecasts not until
2017.”  Sweden’s four-party coalition government will tomorrow
present a budget for next year that includes 25 billion kronor
($3.9 billion) of initiatives to stimulate demand after the
economy slumped last quarter. It will spend most of that on a
fifth round of income tax cuts since coming to power in 2006.  Reinfeldt’s coalition, which was re-elected in 2010, is
trailing in polls ahead of elections in September next year.  The government predicted last month that the largest Nordic
economy will expand faster than previously estimated next year
as it steps up stimulus plans. The $540 billion economy will
grow 1.2 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2014, compared
with July forecasts of 1.3 percent and 2.1 percent,
respectively, the  Finance Ministry  said.  “Our strong position should be used to give support for an
economic recovery,” Reinfeldt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
