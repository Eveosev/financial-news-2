Racing in the  America’s Cup  sailing
series was postponed today and rescheduled for tomorrow because
winds on San Francisco Bay exceeded safety limits.  The wind limit was reduced after a May training accident
that killed Andrew Simpson, a British Olympic gold medalist and
member of the Swedish Cup team Artemis Racing.  Emirates Team New Zealand remains two races from winning
the 162-year-old trophy. Oracle Team USA needs eight wins to
take the Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
