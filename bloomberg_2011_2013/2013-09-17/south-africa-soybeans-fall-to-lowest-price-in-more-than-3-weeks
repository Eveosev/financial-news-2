South African soybeans fell to the
lowest level in more than three weeks, tracking U.S. prices that
dropped yesterday on speculation Midwest rains will halt a
decline in crop conditions.  Soybeans for delivery in December, the most active
contract, dropped 0.8 percent to 5,595 rand ($569) a metric ton,
the lowest since Aug. 23, by the midday close on the South
African Futures Exchange in Johannesburg.  Fields from  North Dakota  to  Ohio  got as much as 1 inch (2.5
centimeters) of rain in recent days, National Weather Service
 data  show. Showers will reach the southwestern Midwest through
midweek, aiding a third of the soy crop, Commodity Weather Group
said in a report.  “Soybeans can still get an advantage because of the rain
in the past few days and in the coming days,” Thys Grobbelaar,
an analyst at Klerksdorp, South Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said
by phone today. “This may result in better yields and we always
follow the U.S. market.”  Soybeans for delivery in November declined 2.4 percent
yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade. The futures rebounded 1
percent to $13.615 a bushel today.  South African white corn for delivery in December gained
0.6 percent to 2,321.80 rand a ton, while the yellow variety for
the same delivery month added 0.3 percent to 2,149 rand a ton. A
meal made from white corn is one of  South Africa ’s staple foods
and yellow corn is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
