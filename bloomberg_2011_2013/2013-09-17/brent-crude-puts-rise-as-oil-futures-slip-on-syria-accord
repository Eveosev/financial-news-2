November Brent puts traded at a
premium to calls for a second straight day as the underlying
futures sank 1.7 percent.  Implied volatility for puts protecting against a 10 percent
drop in November-settlement Brent was 25.78 percent at 4 p.m. in
 New York , up from 25.16 percent on Sept. 13. Calls covering a 10
percent increase fell to 23.44 percent from 23.94.  Brent for November settlement fell $1.88, or 1.7 percent,
to settle at $108.19 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Prices have declined 4.1 percent in two days, the
biggest two-day slide since June 21.  West Texas Intermediate crude’s November contract dropped
$1.37 to $104.82 on the Nymex, sinking along with Brent as  Libya 
was expected to begin restoring production that had been idled
by labor disputes at the country’s oil terminals.  “There’s potential for an increase in Libyan production
and you’re seeing some technical liquidation here,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president at Jefferies Bache LLC in New
York.  Implied volatility for at-the-money November options on
West Texas Intermediate futures rose to 21.93 percent at 4:10
p.m. from 21.42 percent yesterday.  Most-Active  The most active WTI options in electronic trading today
