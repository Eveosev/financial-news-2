Soybeans fell, heading for the
longest slump in seven weeks, on speculation that U.S. planting
was reduced less than forecast by unusually heavy rains in May
and June. Corn fell for a fourth session, and wheat rose.  Growers filed crop-insurance claims that covered 1.69
million acres of soybeans as of Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency said in a report today. Based
on the relationship between claims and planting during the
previous two seasons, today’s report implies farmers sowed
226,000 acres less than the 76.378 million that the USDA said on
Sept. 12 was planted, said  Anne Frick  at Jefferies Bache.  “The claims are below the 500,000 acres to 1 million acres
some people expected to be cut,” Frick, a senior oilseed
analyst, said in a telephone interview from  New York . “The
numbers suggest we are not looking at a big reduction in USDA
planted acreage.”  Soybean futures for delivery in November fell 0.3 percent
to $13.445 a bushel at 12:47 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
heading for the first three-day drop since July 25. Prices fell
3.4 percent the previous two sessions on speculation that rains
in the Midwest would aid yield potential.  Rainfall over the past  week , along with more moisture
 forecast  during the next seven days, may help to reduce stress
and aid some immature crops still filling pods with beans after
six weeks of dry weather, Frick said.  Crop Claims  Farmers who participated in crop-subsidy programs filed
claims for prevented planting on 3.57 million acres of corn, up
from 3.41 million reported in August, the USDA said. The agency
said Sept. 12 that farmers might harvest a record 13.843 billion
bushels, more than previously estimated, as yields recover from
last year’s drought.  Farmers filed crop-insurance claims on 1.98 million acres
of wheat, up from 1.74 million in August, the USDA said.  Corn futures for delivery in December slipped 0.3 percent
to $4.5525 a bushel in Chicago, after rising as much as 2.6
percent. Through yesterday, the most-active futures fell 35
percent this year.  Wheat futures for delivery in December increased 0.4
percent to $6.435 a bushel on the CBOT, heading for the first
gain in three sessions.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
