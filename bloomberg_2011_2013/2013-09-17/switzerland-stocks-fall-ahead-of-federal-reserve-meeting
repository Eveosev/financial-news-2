Swiss stocks  declined for a second
day as investors awaited news from a two-day policy-setting
meeting of the  Federal Reserve  in the U.S. that starts today.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Julius Baer Group Ltd. lost 1.4
percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA, the world’s largest jewelry maker, fell 1.6 percent.  The  SMI (SMI)  retreated 0.4 percent to 8,000.01 at 10:12 a.m. in
Zurich. The measure has still surged 17 percent this year as
central banks around the world pledged to leave interest rates
low for a prolonged period of time. The broader Swiss
Performance Index lost 0.3 percent today.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  meets Sept. 17-18 and
economists in a Bloomberg survey this month forecast policy
makers will reduce the monthly pace of bond purchases by $10
billion, to $75 billion. That’s down from expectations of a $20
billion reduction in a July survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
