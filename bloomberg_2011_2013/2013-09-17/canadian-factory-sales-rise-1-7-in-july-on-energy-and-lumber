Canadian  factory sales  rose at the
fastest pace in five months in July on gains for makers of
commodities from crude oil to lumber to fabricated metals.  Sales climbed 1.7 percent to C$49.5 billion ($48 billion),
 Statistics Canada  reported today from Ottawa, with the total
boosted by upward revisions to the prior two months. The gain
exceeded all 18 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey  with a
median of 0.5 percent.  The report adds to signs the economy is picking up after a
slump in exports and investment late last year and disruptions
in the second quarter from flooding in Alberta and a Quebec
construction strike. The factory gain may contribute to the
world’s 11th largest economy rebounding to growth of 0.7 percent
in July after June’s 0.5 percent drop according to Royal Bank of
Canada economist Nathan Janzen.  “The strength in July was encouraging,” Janzen said in a
telephone interview from Toronto. “The weakness in June didn’t
make sense.” Statistics  Canada  revised the prior month’s
factory sales decline to 0.1 percent from 0.5 percent.  Petroleum and coal sales rose 2.4 percent to C$7.03
billion, the highest since February, as prices rose. Fabricated
metal sales climbed 5.9 percent to C$2.81 billion, and wood
products gained 6.3 percent to C$1.97 billion, bringing the gain
over the past 12 months to 14.7 percent.  Jewelry and silverware sales led a 23.9 percent jump in the
miscellaneous category to C$1.13 billion, rebounding from a
similar decline the month before.  Dollar Gains  The Canadian dollar gained 0.2 percent to C$1.0308 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:00 a.m. in Toronto. Yesterday it touched C$1.0283
per U.S. dollar, the highest since Aug. 12. One dollar buys
97.01 U.S. cents.  Fifteen of 21 industries tracked by Statistics Canada
reported increases in July. Excluding price changes, a better
indicator of the industry’s contribution to economic growth,
factory sales rose 1.1 percent.  The gains came after flooding in June in  Alberta , home to
the country’s oil sands deposits. Sales in that province rose
2.1 percent in July.  Unfilled orders  rose 0.4 percent to C$73.6 billion in July,
while new orders dropped 1.7 percent to C$49.8 billion.
Inventories rose 0.4 percent to C$69.1 billion, with the ratio
of factory stockpiles to sales falling to 1.40 from 1.41.  Even with the gains, factory sales  fell  0.1 percent from a
year earlier and remain below the peak of C$50.5 billion at the
end of 2011. That leaves manufacturing as the biggest sector of
Canada’s economy that hasn’t returned to levels recorded before
the last recession in 2008.  “Today’s report perhaps provides early signs that the
winds might be changing for the struggling industry,” Francis Fong, economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, wrote in note to
clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
