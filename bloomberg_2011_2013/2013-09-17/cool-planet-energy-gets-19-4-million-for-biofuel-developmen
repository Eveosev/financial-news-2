Cool Planet Energy Systems Inc., a
closely held biofuel developer, raised $19.4 million to help
build its first production facility.  The plant, which  will be  in Alexandria,  Louisiana , is on
schedule to be completed by the end of next year, Chief
Financial Officer Barry Rowan said today in an interview. The
company uses a chemical-mechanical process to convert non-food
biomass into fuel, and it plans to build 30 manufacturing units
within three years to make gasoline.  “The ultimate business plan calls for multi-hundreds of
plants in the U.S. and significantly more globally,” Rowan
said. “We’re highly confident we’ll have adequate capital to do
that.”  Cool Planet, based in  Greenwood Village ,  Colorado , has
raised or received commitments on more than $60 million in debt
that will be converted to equity, Wes Bolsen, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The biofuel developer in June raised $29.9 million from
 investors  including Google Inc., General Electric Co., BP Plc,
ConocoPhillips, NRG Energy Inc. and Exelon Corp. The company may
raise $100 million this year, Rowan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
