Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
warned Congress against waiting to increase the debt ceiling and
said the administration wouldn’t accept an agreement that
defunds or delays President  Barack Obama ’s health-care law.  “Trying to time a debt limit increase to the last minute
could be very dangerous,” Lew said today in remarks prepared
for a speech to the Economic Club of  Washington , D.C. “If
Congress does not act and the U.S. suddenly cannot pay its
bills, the repercussions could be serious.”  Lew told Congress last month in a letter that lawmakers
need to raise the $16.7 trillion  debt ceiling  by the middle of
next month, when he expects that the Treasury will have about
$50 billion left to fund the government.  Lew said the idea of “prioritization,” paying some bills
and not others, was “unworkable.”  “We should never be put in a position where we have to
pick which commitments our nation should meet,” Lew said. “How
can the  United States  choose whether to send Social Security
checks to seniors or pay benefits to our veterans?”  With two weeks left before government funding expires at
the end of this month, congressional Republicans are setting up
a confrontation with Obama over a provision in the health-care
law that allows individuals to sign up for insurance exchanges
starting Oct. 1.  Lew said in his remarks that Obama won’t negotiate over the
debt ceiling, though “the president is willing to negotiate
over the future direction of fiscal policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
