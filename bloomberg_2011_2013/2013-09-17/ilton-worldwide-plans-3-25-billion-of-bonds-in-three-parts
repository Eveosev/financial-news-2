Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.
plans to issue $3.25 billion of bonds in a three-part offering,
according to a statement from  Standard & Poor’s .  The world’s largest hotel chain will issue $1.25 billion in
eight-year senior secured notes and $2 billion of senior
unsecured notes due in 2021 and 2023, according to the
statement.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to repay existing debt,
which exceeded $15 billion as of June 30, according to a Sept.
12 regulatory filing. S&P assigned Hilton a BB- corporate credit
rating with a stable outlook, according to the statement.  Hilton filed to raise $1.25 billion in an initial public
offering, proceeds of which would pay down borrowings, according
to the regulatory document. McLean, Virginia-based Hilton was
acquired by New York-based private equity firm  Blackstone Group
LP (BX)  in 2007 for $26 billion, including debt.  The hotel operator is also seeking $5.85 billion in loans
and $3.5 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities to
refinance debt, according to the S&P statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
