Enforcement actions by the  Internal
Revenue Service  yielded $50.2 billion in fiscal year 2012 -- a 9
percent drop in part because of budget cuts, the U.S. tax
agency’s inspector general said in a report today.  The IRS shed 8,000 full-time positions between 2010 and
2012 including 5,000 front-line enforcement workers, which is
about a 14 percent reduction, said  the report  from the Treasury
Inspector General for Tax Administration.  Some of the decline in collections may be the result of IRS
policy changes. The agency’s Fresh Start Initiative was designed
to reduce the number of tax liens filed and was created in
response to concerns that the IRS was seizing property too
aggressively.  The IRS also has been charged with implementing parts of
the 2010 health-care law, diverting resources that could have
been devoted to audits and collections.  IRS officials and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew have
argued for a budget increase in fiscal 2014, citing the risk of
uncollected taxes from what they call counterproductive cuts.
 House Republicans  have proposed a 24 percent budget cut.  Congress probably won’t resolve the agency’s funding levels
until later in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
