U.S. stocks surged, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a record, while the dollar slid
and Treasuries and gold rallied as the Federal Reserve
unexpectedly refrained from reducing its monetary stimulus.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  added 1.2 percent to 1,725.52 at 4 p.m. in New
York, its biggest gain since Aug. 1, after dropping as much as
0.3 percent before the Fed decision. The Bloomberg U.S. Dollar
Index sank 1.1 percent for its biggest slide in two months,
while the pound reached an eight-month high versus the American
currency. The yield on 10-year  U.S. Treasuries  dropped 16 basis
points to 2.69 percent as the note jumped the most since 2011.
Gold rose more than 4 percent oil surged 2.5 percent.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said after a two-day
meeting that it wants to see more more evidence that economic
progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its $85
billion in monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage debt.
While “downside risks” to the outlook have diminished, “
tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if
sustained, could slow the pace of improvement,” the central
bank said.  “Everyone was a little stupefied,” Erik Davidson, deputy
chief investment officer for Wells Fargo Private Bank,  which
oversees $170 billion, said by phone. “It’s great to own stocks
when we’re at these great levels. When money’s going to continue
to be free for a while, it all plays into the valuations.”  Economists Predictions  A total of 7.4 billion U.S. shares changed hands today, the
most since June 28. Volume surged after the Fed’s announcement.
About 552 million shares traded on all exchanges in the 10
minutes after 2 p.m., compared with 113 million in the preceding
10 minutes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Economists had forecast the FOMC would dial down monthly
Treasury purchases by $5 billion, to $40 billion, while
maintaining its buying of mortgage-backed securities at $40
billion, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “There is no fixed calendar schedule, I really have to
emphasize that,” Bernanke said at a press conference after the
statement. “If the data confirm our basic outlook” for growth
and the labor market, “then we could begin later this year.”  Most  Federal Reserve  policy makers expect the first
increase in the nation’s benchmark  lending rate  to occur in
2015. The federal funds rate target will be 2 percent at the end
of 2016, according to the median of estimates by five governors
on the Fed’s board and 12 reserve bank presidents. That rate
compares with their median estimate of 4 percent for where the
rate should be at a time of full employment and stable prices.  The Fed’s stimulus has helped the  S&P 500  rally more than
155 percent from its March 2009 low. Speculation over the future
of quantitative easing has whipsawed global asset prices since
May, when Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled cuts may start
in 2013. The S&P 500 tumbled 5.8 percent from a record on May 21
through June 24. It rebounded 8.7 percent to close at a record
month, then slumped as much as 4.6 percent before rebounding
again and climbing within five points of the record yesterday.  Market Movers  Ten-year Treasury yields have increased from a record low
close of 1.39 percent in July 2012. The rate is down from a
more-than two-year high of 3.005 percent on  Sept. 6. (USGG10YR)   An S&P index of 11 U.S. homebuilding stocks rallied 6
percent after declining almost 1.4 percent before the Fed
statement, with Ryland Group Inc. and KB Home leading gains.
Housing starts rose 0.9 percent to a 891,000 annual rate,
following the prior month’s 883,000 pace that was weaker than
previously estimated. The median estimate of 83 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for 917,000. Permits dropped 3.8
percent.  Utility stocks, which offer 4 percent of their price in
dividends for the second-biggest payout among  10 groups , jumped
3 percent as a group today as the drop in bond yields reduced
competition to dividends. Gauges of raw-material, technology and
industrial shares also climbed at least 1.3 percent as all 10 of
the main industries in the S&P 500 advanced.  FedEx Earnings  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  rallied 5 percent after reporting earnings that
 beat  analysts’ estimates, bolstered by demand for ground
shipping and lower maintenance expenses for new planes at the
world’s largest cargo airline. Dollar Tree Inc. gained 3.6
percent after adopting a $2 billion buyback program. Adobe
Systems Inc. rallied 9.2 percent, the most in three years, and
reached a record as the largest maker of graphic-design tools
said it amassed more than 1 million customers for its online
services.  WellPoint Inc. lost 4.4 percent and HealthNet fell 0.9
percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Justin Lake said the two
companies would be most affected by any delay in the start of
open enrollment in new health-care exchanges mandated by the
Affordable Care Act. UnitedHealth Group Inc. lost 1.7 percent.  Europe, Emerging  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.4 percent, recovering
most of yesterday’s 0.5 percent decline. European markets closed
before the release of the Fed statement.  Zodiac Aerospace SA (ZC) ,
the world’s largest maker of airline seats, rallied 5.7 percent
in Paris trading after full-year sales increased and Bank of
America Corp. upgraded its recommendation on the shares.  Among  emerging markets ,  Brazil ’s Ibovespa rallied 2.6
percent to the highest level since May. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland companies listed in  Hong Kong 
decreased 0.6 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index added
0.3 percent.  India ’s S&P BSE Sensex jumped 0.8 percent and
 Russia ’s Micex decreased 0.6 percent. Malaysia’s ringgit
strengthened 0.5 percent versus dollar.  WTI oil jumped 2.5 percent, the most in three weeks, to
$108.07 a barrel, extending earlier gains triggered after the
U.S. Energy Information Administration said stockpiles fell 4.37
million barrels to 355.6 million barrels last week. Inventories
were forecast to decline 1.2 million barrels, according to the
median of 11 analyst estimates in a Bloomberg survey before
publication of the inventory report.  Gold, Pound  Gold for immediate delivery surged 4.1 percent to $1,364.35
an ounce after earlier falling as much as 1.4 percent.  The pound gained 1.4 percent to $1.6121 after minutes of
the Bank of England’s last meeting showed policy makers voted
unanimously to keep policy unchanged this month as an improving
economic outlook prompted agreement that no more stimulus was
needed. The 10-year gilt yield rose seven basis points to 3.00
percent.  Spain ’s 10-year bonds outperformed similar-maturity German
debt, reducing the extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities to as little as 2.39 percentage points, the least
since July 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
