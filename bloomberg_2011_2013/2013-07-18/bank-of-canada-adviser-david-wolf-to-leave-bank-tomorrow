Bank of Canada  Adviser David Wolf
said he is leaving the central bank effective today and will
start a job in the private sector.  Wolf, in a telephone interview from Ottawa, declined to say
where his new job is located or who it’s with, citing the bank’s
cooling-off policy.  Wolf was the main editor of the quarterly  Monetary Policy
Report  for the last three years, according to the Bank of  Canada 
 website . The 37-year-old worked with the six-member governing
council that sets the bank’s benchmark interest rates in
drafting the economic forecast papers.  In a note to the bank’s staff, Governor Stephen Poloz and
Senior Deputy Governor Tiff Macklem “praised David’s deep
understanding of financial markets and monetary policy and his
strong communication skills,” spokesman  Jeremy Harrison  said.
“On behalf of Governing Council, they thanked him for his
tremendous contribution to the bank during the past four
years.”  Before coming to the central bank under former Governor
 Mark Carney , Wolf had been head of Canadian economics and chief
strategist with Bank of America Securities-Merrill Lynch Canada.
He also spent eight years as an economist and strategist with
Royal Bank’s Capital Markets unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
