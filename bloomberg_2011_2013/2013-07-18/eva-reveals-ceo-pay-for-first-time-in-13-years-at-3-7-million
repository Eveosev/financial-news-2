Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
revealed compensation for Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Levin
today, marking the first time in 13 years that  Israel ’s largest
company reported individual pay.  Levin’s compensation for 2012 will total $3.7 million
excluding options and shares, Teva said in a proxy statement.
Part of the pay is a bonus that investors will be asked to
approve at an Aug. 27 meeting.  Teva is responding to changes in Israeli corporate law,
sparked by public ire at rising income inequality, that require
publicly traded companies to request shareholder approval for
compensation policy. The increased transparency is a victory for
shareholders Sharon Hannes and Ehud Kamar, who in June settled a
lawsuit in which Teva agreed to reveal pay for top managers.  Teva, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, switched
from reporting pay for each of its five top  managers  in its 1999
and 2000 annual reports to publishing a combined figure after
Israeli law was changed to allow dual-listed companies to use
financial statements produced under rules of the other country.  Levin earned a $1.5 million base salary as well as a $1
million signing bonus for 2012 that was paid in February this
year, and is in line for the $1.2 million bonus, Teva said. The
CEO also received 450,000 share options with an exercise price
of $46.04 and 115,383 restricted share units exercisable in
three equal annual installments beginning on the second
anniversary of the grant date.  Bargain CEO  Levin’s pay is lower than the $17.2 million median pay of
CEOs leading large pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and $9.3
million in  Europe , according to Bloomberg Industry calculations.
Leading that list was Pfizer Inc.’s  Ian Read , who earned $25.6
million in 2012.  Levin, a Cambridge University-educated physician, worked at
New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. as senior vice president
for strategy before joining Petach Tikva-based Teva.  The Israeli company has gained about 8 percent including
reinvested dividends this year. That compares with a 22 percent
advance for the 18-member Bloomberg Europe Pharmaceutical Index.  The Aug. 27 shareholder meeting will include votes on
compensation policy, bonus objectives and term extensions for
board members Moshe Many, Arie Belldegrun, Amir Elstein and
Yitzhak Peterburg, Teva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
