Spain beat its goal at a bond
auction and its borrowing costs fell after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said tapering bond purchases in the
U.S. hinges on economic data.  The Madrid-based  Treasury  sold 3.06 billion euros of debt
($4 billion), more than its maximum target of 3 billion euros.
Its three-year benchmark was sold to yield 2.768 percent, down
from 2.875 percent on July 4. A five-year note yielded 3.735
percent, down from 3.792 percent earlier this month, and its 10-year benchmark bond fetched 4.723 percent, down from 4.765
percent on June 20.  Spanish  government bonds  have fallen since May amid
speculation the Fed was preparing to unwind liquidity measures.
The  European Central Bank  responded with a commitment to keep
 interest rates  low for an extended period of time.  Still, the yield on  Spain’s 10-year benchmark  bond was 18
basis points higher than a month ago at 4.73 percent at 11:49
a.m. in  Madrid . The country’s credit rating is held at one level
above non-investment grade by two rating companies.  “The auction result was average,” Aditya Chordia, a
strategist at JPMorgan Chase Bank in London, wrote in a research
note. “The amount issued was the lowest for any standard
auction since the start of the year.”  Demand for the country’s 2016 notes was 2.57 times the
amount sold, down from 3.46 in July, while the bid-to-cover
ratio was 2.1 for the 2018 securities, up from 1.71, and 2.26
for the 2023 bonds, up from 1.84 in June.  The Treasury, which is scheduled to sell three- and nine-month bills next week, will consider ways of diversifying its
funding methods with longer-dated bonds, inflation-linked bonds
or dollar securities if positive  market sentiment  continues, an
Economy Ministry official said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
