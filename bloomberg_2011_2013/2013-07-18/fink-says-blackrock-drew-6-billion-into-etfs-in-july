(Corrects spelling of Fink’s name in first paragraph.)  Laurence D. Fink, chief executive
officer of  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , said the world’s largest asset
manager attracted $6 billion in new money into its exchange-traded funds so far this month.  Deposits into ETFs are running at about the same rate as
last year when excluding June, Fink said today in an interview.
The New York-based firm is seeing no change in the way
institutional investors behave, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
