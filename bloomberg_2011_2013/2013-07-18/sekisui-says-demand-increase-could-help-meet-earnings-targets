Sekisui House Ltd. (1928)  said it has seen
“strong demand” ahead of tax and mortgage-rate increases that
could help  Japan ’s second-biggest homebuilder meet earnings
goals.  “We are getting a good feel about delivering decent
results based on our earnings targets,” President Toshinori Abe, 61, said in an interview in Tokyo on July 16, adding that
back orders for homes are rising faster than the company had
anticipated.  Sekisui in March forecast sales to rise 7.8 percent to 1.74
trillion yen ($17 billion) in the year ending Jan. 31 from a
year earlier. Orders on average for the company gained 15
percent in the first five months ended June 30 from the same
period last year.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s pledge to end 15 years of
deflation have fueled expectations that  mortgage rates  and land
prices, which are about half of what they were after the peak of
the bubble economy in the 1980s, will start rising. Japan’s
housing starts rose for a ninth month in May, the longest streak
since the period ended February 2011.  A fixed-rate mortgage  loan  for 35 years rose to 2.03
percent in June from an all-time low of 1.8 percent in April,
according to the government-affiliated Japan Housing Finance
Agency.  Sekisui shares rose 0.9 percent to 1,437 yen at the close
of trading in Tokyo, the highest in two weeks. The stock has
gained 53 percent this year, compared with a 30 percent increase
in the 94-member Topix Construction Index, which includes
Sekisui.  Tax Increase  While the government’s plan to raise the  consumption tax  is
spurring buyers to purchase before the increase comes into
effect, the government should be careful how it deals with an
expected decline in demand following the change, Abe said. Japan
plans to double the  tax rate  to 10 percent from 5 percent by
2015, with the first increase to 8 percent scheduled in April
2014.  “It doesn’t make sense to introduce a tax increase when
the economy is not yet fully recovered,” Abe said. “What
matters to us the most and the country as a whole is economic
recovery and revitalization.”  Housing starts  nationwide gained 6.2 percent to 893,002
units in the year ended March 31, the fastest pace since 1996,
according to the land ministry. Supplies declined 22 percent in
a decade to March 2011 from the previous 10 years, it said.  Tailor-made houses and rental housing have seen “solid
growth,” Abe said. The Osaka-based company plans to strengthen
its home-building segment by improving its energy-saving and
quake-resistant technology to differentiate itself from
competitors and to attract more homebuyers, he said.  “The customer preference has changed over time,” Abe
said. “When homebuyers are happy with our products, they are
likely to bring more business opportunities to us.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
