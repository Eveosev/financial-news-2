Copper fell to a one-week low in New
York as signs of rising home prices in China and an improving
job market in the U.S. damped prospects for further economic
stimulus in the two largest metal-using countries.  A report today showing price gains last month in 69 of 70
Chinese cities may limit room for the government to spur
economic growth, said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at
Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. U.S.
applications for  unemployment benefits  fell to a two-month low,
amid speculation that Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
will reduce the central bank’s bond-buying program.  “We’ve seen conflicting economic data lately, and the
market is in a bit of a summer funk, so copper continues to
flounder,” Frank Cholly, a senior commodities broker at RJO
Futures in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “You need
the whole global economy moving in the same direction to get
things back on track.”  Copper futures for delivery in September slipped 0.4
percent to $3.117 a pound at 10:28 a.m. on the Comex in New
York, after falling to $3.1065, the lowest since July 11.  Signs of increased production also discouraged buyers.
 Anglo American Plc (AAL) , which mines copper in Chile, said its
quarterly output gained 14 percent.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.1 percent to $6,880.50 a metric ton ($3.12 a
pound).  Lead, tin, aluminum, nickel and zinc also slid in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
