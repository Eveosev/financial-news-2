Nasdaq 100 Index futures dropped
after Google Inc.’s second-quarter results fell short of
estimates and Microsoft Inc.’s profit missed projections, adding
to disappointing results from big technology companies.  Futures on the Nasdaq 100 slid 1 percent to 3,047.50 at
5:11 p.m. in New York. The index slipped 0.2 percent today even
as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose to records.  “There are some chinks in the armor out there,” Daniel Genter, who oversees about $4 billion as president and chief
executive officer of Los Angeles-based RNC Genter Capital
Management, said in a telephone interview. “Though is it priced
for perfection, it isn’t perfection. Investors are becoming more
discerning with regards to individual stocks.”  Google slid 3.8 percent to $876. The owner of the world’s
most popular search engine reported second-quarter sales and
profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates as advertising
tied to mobile devices crimped average prices.  Microsoft plunged 6.1 percent to $33.28 as profit missed
analysts’ projections after Windows sales were hurt by shrinking
demand for personal computers amid an unexpected writedown of
unsold Surface tablet inventory.  The results from Google and Microsoft came after technology
stocks fell 0.3 percent during regular trading, the second-worst
 performance  among 10 groups in the  S&P 500  today.  Intel Corp . fell the most in the Dow today after
forecasting sales that may fall short of some analysts’
estimates. EBay Inc. tumbled 6.7 percent, the most since August
2011, after its third-quarter sales forecast missed estimates.  The S&P 500 gained 0.5 percent to 1,689.37 at 4 p.m. in New
York, as earnings from Morgan Stanley and UnitedHealth Group
Inc. beat estimates and jobless claims fell. The  index  surpassed
its previous intraday high of 1,687.18 set on May 22. The Dow
Jones Industrial Average added 78.02 points, or 0.5 percent, to
15,548.54, also a record.  S&P 500 futures were up 0.3 percent at 5:15 p.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporters on this story:
