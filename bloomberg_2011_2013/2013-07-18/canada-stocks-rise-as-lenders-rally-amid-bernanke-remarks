Canadian  stocks  rose, sending the
benchmark index to the highest level since June 3, as lenders
surged and investors watched a second day of testimony from U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  Royal  Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, climbed
1.6 percent to the highest in almost five months. OceanaGold
Corp. and Detour Gold Corp. added at least 1.6 percent as the
metal’s price advanced.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 97.09
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,665.86 at 10:52 a.m. in Toronto.
Trading was in line with the 30-day average at this time of day.  Investors watched further commentary from Bernanke, after
the Fed chairman said yesterday that the pace of economic
recovery will determine when the central bank reduces its asset
purchases.  Canadian  wholesale sales  rose at the fastest pace in more
than two years in May, reaching a record on sales of fertilizer
and food. Sales rose 2.3 percent to C$50.3 billion ($48.3
billion),  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa, compared with
the median estimate for a 0.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey
with 15 responses.  The Bank of Canada is counting on business investment and
exports to drive growth, saying yesterday the world’s 11th-largest economy won’t reach full capacity until mid-2015 because
of weak foreign demand and slower housing investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
