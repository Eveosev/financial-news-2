The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  rose for a fourth day,
its longest winning streak in two months, after beef producer
 JBS SA (JBSS3)  followed commodities higher as reports showed signs of
U.S. economic strength.  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA climbed the most on the gauge,
leading gains among homebuilders.  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , the shipbuilder
owned by billionaire  Eike Batista , rallied after saying it hired
Credit Suisse Group AG for a possible sale of assets. Consumer-health products manufacturer  Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3)  rose after JPMorgan
Chase & Co. raised the stock to the equivalent of buy.  The Ibovespa added 0.5 percent to 47,656.92 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, extending its four-day jump to 4.7
percent. Forty-three of the gauge’s 71 stocks rose. The real
climbed 0.1 percent to 2.2243 per dollar at 5:33 p.m. local
time. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials rose
0.7 percent as a U.S. report showed manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region expanded more than forecast.  “The Ibovespa is tracking the better mood in the global
markets after economic data in the U.S. were better than
expected,”  Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset
Management, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “It’s been a
while since we last saw stocks rising for four straight days. We
could be at the beginning of a more positive trend.”  Brookfield surged 7.4 percent to 1.74 reais, the biggest
one-day gain since Sept. 13. PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos e
Participacoes jumped 4.3 percent to 1.93 reais.  JBS advanced 4.7 percent to 6.88 reais, the highest level
since June 7. OSX climbed 4.2 percent to 1.24 reais. Hypermarcas
gained 3.1 percent to 16.40 reais.  Earnings Outlook  The Ibovespa earlier today dropped as much as 0.7 percent
after clothing retailer  Cia. Hering (HGTX3)  said sales at stores open at
least a year fell 1.2 percent in the second quarter from a year
earlier.  “Companies are beginning to report second-quarter
earnings, and we don’t expect very exciting numbers from
industries that depend more on domestic consumption,” Gustavo Mendonca, who helps manage 1 billion reais as an economist at
Saga Capital, said by phone from Rio de Janeiro. “These
companies will probably report weaker sales, which reflect some
problems we’re seeing in  Brazil , including slower growth and
higher inflation.”  Analysts covering Brazil reduced their 2013 growth forecast
for nine straight weeks to 2.31 percent, according to a July 12
central bank survey of about 100 economists.  Hering climbed 0.3 percent to 30.30 reais after earlier
today slumping as much as 3.1 percent.  Banco Bradesco SA, Brazil’s second-largest bank by market
value, declined 1.3 percent to 28.22 reais after Exame magazine
reported on its website that the lender had “billionaire
losses” on swap rate investments in the second quarter.  Exame didn’t say where it got the information. Bradesco
denied the report in a e-mailed statement.  2013 Slump  The Ibovespa has slumped 22 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping out $233 billion from the  value  of Brazilian
equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil’s main
equity gauge trades at 11.9 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.3 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.93 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.79 billion reais this year
through July 13, according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
