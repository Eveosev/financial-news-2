Indian Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde ordered an investigation after as many as seven
protesters were shot dead by police in the disputed region of
Kashmir.  Any excessive use of force will be dealt with, Shinde said
in televised comments as national media differed on the trigger
for the demonstrations in the Ramban district of the state of
 Jammu and Kashmir .  The Hindustan Times reported that the brother of a
religious leader was roughed up by police yesterday evening,
while the  Hindu daily  said Border Security Force personnel had
entered a mosque wearing shoes. Police opened fire on the
protesters after they began throwing stones and later attacked a
BSF barracks, the Times said.  The Himalayan territory of Kashmir is the biggest hurdle to
India and  Pakistan  improving relations. The nuclear-armed South
Asian neighbors have fought two of their three wars since 1947
over the region that is divided between them and claimed in full
by both countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
