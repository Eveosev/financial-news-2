England recovered from losing three
early wickets to reach 80-3 at lunch of the first day of its
second Ashes Test with  Australia  at Lord’s Cricket Ground in
 London .  Jonathan Trott, unbeaten on 34, and Ian Bell, on 23,
combined for 52 in the opening session. The hosts lost captain
Alastair Cook for 12 runs, Joe Root for 6 and Kevin Pietersen
for 2 in the fifth and sixth overs. Ryan Harris, who was added
to the Australian team this morning, took 2-21.  Cook won the toss and elected to bat. England is leading
the five-match series 1-0 after a 14-run victory in Nottingham.  England opted to include bowler Tim Bresnan in place of
Steven Finn. The Australians picked Usman Khawaja and Harris to
replace  Ed Cowan  and Mitchell Starc.  Queen Elizabeth II attended the opening session of today’s
match.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
