President  Barack Obama  promoted the
benefits of the health-care law that was the main domestic
policy victory of his first term as the administration campaigns
to get uninsured American to sign up for coverage.  With Republicans in Congress and some state legislatures
still resisting implementation of the law, Obama held an event
at the White House accompanied by a group of citizens who the
administration said have benefited from provisions of the act.  “Health-care costs have slowed drastically in some areas
since we passed the Affordable Care Act,” Obama said. The law
is doing what it was designed to, which is “deliver more
choices, better benefits, a check on rising costs and higher
quality health care.”  The administration released a report today showing that
premiums for some medical plans to be sold to the uninsured next
year will be 18 percent less costly than government analysts had
forecast last year.  The health-care law seeks to expand coverage to most of the
nation’s 50 million uninsured people. About 7 million people are
expected to enroll in exchange plans next year, rising to 25
million by 2018, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .  To contact the reporters on this story:
