China  is  pumping crude  at the
fastest pace in more than two and a half years as explorers in
the world’s second-largest oil consumer seek to profit from
rising prices.  The country produced 17.44 million metric tons of crude
last month, figures from the National Bureau of Statistics in
Beijing show. That’s equivalent to 4.26 million barrels a day,
the highest rate since November 2010 when output reached 4.28
million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations based
on the data.  “Oil fields boosted production as international prices
have jumped,” Gong Jinshuang, a Beijing-based senior engineer
at China National Petroleum Corp., the nation’s biggest oil
company, said by phone today.  China’s production growth is coinciding with an increase in
benchmark crude prices. Oil futures traded in New York have
gained 16 percent in 2013, surging above $100 a barrel this
month as unrest in  Egypt  fanned concern that Middle East
shipments may be disrupted. The U.S., the world’s biggest oil
user, yesterday reported its own output rising to 7.49 million
barrels a day, the highest since December 1990.  China’s largest oil producers have boosted exploration
since the start of this year, according to Gong. In the first
quarter,  PetroChina Co. (857)  produced 231 million barrels of crude,
1.8 percent more than in same period last year, the company’s
quarterly report shows.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386)  pumped
82.17 million in the three months, up 0.8 percent, while  Cnooc
Ltd. (883)  yielded 76.5 million, an increase of 20 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
