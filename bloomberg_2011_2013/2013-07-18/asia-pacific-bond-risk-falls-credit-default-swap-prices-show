The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
123 basis points as of 10:23 a.m. in Sydney, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The index is on course for its lowest
close since June 10, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  slid 4 basis points to 137 as of 8:23
a.m. in Hong Kong, Westpac prices show. The gauge is set for its
lowest close since July 16, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 1.5 basis points to
91 as of 9:32 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
index is on track for its lowest close since July 15, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
