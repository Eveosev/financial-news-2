Cushman & Wakefield Inc., the
largest closely held commercial broker, said  Asia  is the place
to be for investment opportunities amid growing interest in the
region’s property market.  “Interest in real estate is absolutely as high as we have
ever seen,” Executive Chairman Carlo Sant’Albano, 49, said in
an interview in Tokyo. “When you look at the growth profile of
the world in the next several years, Asia remains absolutely
critical path for growth.”  Asia accounted for 47 percent of global real estate
transactions last year, according to data compiled by the New
York-based broker. Global property investment volume will
probably exceed $1 trillion this year, the highest level since
2007, according to the data.  China, Japan and  Hong Kong  were the top investment targets
in 2012 from Asia, according to Cushman. The company, run by
Italy’s Agnelli family that also controls  Fiat SpA (F) , expanded its
operations into  Taiwan  and the Philippines this year to capture
the opportunities in the region.  “If you want growth, Asia is the place you want to come,”
said Sant’Albano. “If you want a very solid core investment,
maybe more yield related rather than capital gain, you would
look at Japan, London and Australia, and some of the major
cities around the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
