The U.S. Export-Import Bank voted to
stop consideration of financing for a coal power plant in
Vietnam, the first such decision since President  Barack Obama 
vowed to cut federal support for the projects.  The lender said loans for U.S. exports to the Thai Binh Two
power plant were rejected under policies in place before the
president’s pledge last month.  Climate-change  activists said the
decision is an important signal in the global-warming fight.  “By denying taxpayer backed financing for this dirty coal
project, the Export-Import Bank put the action in the
President’s Climate Action Plan,” Doug Norlen, policy director
of Pacific Environment, which is fighting these kinds of fossil-fuel projects, said today in an e-mail.  Until now, Obama’s push to double exports of U.S. goods and
services had undercut his goal of reducing the  greenhouse gases 
linked to climate change, as the government-backed lender
expanded financing that, by its own accounting, added to
greenhouse-gas emissions.  Ex-Im financing for fossil-fuel projects in countries such
as India and  South Africa  reached a record $9.6 billion in the
2012 fiscal year, almost double the 2011 total and five times
the funding in the final year of the  Bush administration ,
according to Ex-Im data compiled by Pacific Environment.  In addition to coal plants, the lender supports oil-field
exploration, pipelines, refineries and gas-fired power plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
