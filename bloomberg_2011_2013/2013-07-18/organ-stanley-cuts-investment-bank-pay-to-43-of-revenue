Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s
biggest brokerage, set aside 1.4 percent less to pay people at
its investment-banking and trading division in the first half.  Compensation for staff at the institutional securities unit
was $3.66 billion, according to figures posted today on the New
York-based firm’s  website . Salaries, bonuses and previous
deferred awards equaled 43 percent of adjusted revenue, down
from 46 percent a year earlier.  Morgan Stanley has cut pay and jobs, deferred bonuses and
toughened clawback rules as Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 55, copes with increases in  capital requirements  and
regulation. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in April
that the bank seeks to set aside about 40 percent of revenue for
pay in institutional securities.  The bank today reported a 66 percent quarterly earnings
increase that beat analysts’ estimates as stock-trading revenue
jumped and wealth-management profit margins climbed to a record.
Its shares rose to $27.72 at 8:55 a.m. in  New York  from $26.54
yesterday.  Companywide compensation and benefits rose 3.2 percent to
$8.32 billion in the first half as adjusted revenue increased
8.4 percent to $16.8 billion. That revenue figure excludes
accounting charges known as debt-valuation adjustments. Those
changes stem from increases in the value of the company’s  debt ,
under the theory that it would be more expensive to buy back the
securities.  Per Person  The bank’s total compensation cost was enough to pay each
of the firm’s 55,610 employees $149,631 on average for the six
months, more than the $137,496 it set aside for each of the
58,627 employees a year earlier, figures released today show.
The company doesn’t disclose how many people work in
institutional securities.  Morgan Stanley (MS) ’s brokerage division employed 16,321
financial advisers at the end of June, down from 16,478 a year
earlier. It set aside $4.1 billion for pay, up from $3.9 billion
a year earlier, according to figures in today’s report.  The unit’s compensation cost, set by a fixed grid for some
employees, was 59 percent of its revenue, compared with 60
percent a year earlier.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said this week it set aside a
smaller portion for staff pay in the first half and cut 300 jobs
in the second quarter as it seeks to pare expenses. Compensation
rose 10 percent to $8.04 billion in the six months, while
revenue increased 13 percent to $18.7 billion.  The expense is enough to pay each of Goldman Sachs’s 31,700
employees $253,691 for the first six months of the year.  JPMorgan’s Tally  Compensation for corporate and investment bankers at
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest U.S. lender, was almost
unchanged in the first half from a year earlier. The $6.36
billion represented 33 percent of revenue at the unit.  The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the total compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don’t represent individual workers’ actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end.  To contact the reporters on this story:
