Chinese  stocks  fell for a second
day, led by real estate companies and commodity producers, amid
concern increasing home prices will limit room for the
government to spur economic growth.  A  gauge  tracking developers slid 1.7 percent.  House prices 
in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou rose the most since at least
January 2011 last month from a year earlier, official data
showed. The government may expand a tax on property purchases,
Xinhua News Agency said yesterday.  Yunnan Tin Co. (000960)  and Jiangxi
Copper Co. retreated more than 2.5 percent. The International
Monetary Fund said risks are increasing that China’s  growth  this
year will fall short of the lender’s forecast.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.1 percent to
2,023.40 at the close, extending yesterday’s 1 percent loss. The
CSI 300 Index declined 1.6 percent to 2,245.33. The  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
added 0.2 percent.  “The fact that home prices are still rising will prevent
the government from loosening policies,” said Wu Kan, a
Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “Property is a big constraint on
economic policies.”  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 2.1 percent
lower than the 30-day average today. Thirty-day  volatility  was
at 26.7, after yesterday reaching its highest level since
December 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Home Prices  Home prices climbed in 69 of the 70 cities the government
tracked last month from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today, matching the data in May. The southern
business city of Guangzhou posted the biggest increase with a 16
percent advance. Prices climbed 13 percent in Beijing and 12
percent in Shanghai. All three cities had their biggest gains
since government data began in January 2011.  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, lost 2.6 percent to 10.12  yuan . Poly Real Estate
Group Co., the second largest, sank 2.1 percent to 10.78 yuan.
Gemdale Corp., the fourth biggest, retreated 3 percent to 6.91
yuan.  “Downside risks” to the IMF’s 7.75 percent growth
estimate have risen after a gauge of manufacturing weakened in
June, the Washington-based fund said yesterday in its annual
assessment of China’s economy.  “The growth outlook is clouded by mounting domestic
vulnerabilities in the financial, fiscal and real estate
sectors,” the IMF’s Executive Board said in a statement.  China’s richest man  Zong Qinghou  said the nation’s growth
will slide further in the second half of the year and proposed
cutting taxes and breaking up monopolies to drive an economic
recovery.  Coal Producers  Gauges (SHSZ300)  tracking material and energy producers dropped at
least 1.5 percent on the CSI 300. Yunnan Tin, the world’s
largest producer of the metal, slid 2.6 percent to 11.80 yuan.
Jiangxi Copper slumped 2.8 percent to 16.14 yuan, taking its
loss for this year to 32 percent.  Datong Coal Industry Co. (601001) , China’s third-largest coal
company by capacity, slumped 4 percent to 6 yuan. Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co., the fourth biggest, fell 3.8 percent to 9.73 yuan.  The Bohai-Rim steam coal price index, which tracks power-station coal prices at six Chinese ports, fell 1.5 percent in
the week to yesterday, according to the Qinhuangdao Seaborne
Coal Market’s website.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 11 percent this year as
data from industrial production to exports pointed to a slowdown
in the economy and as money-market rates reached record highs
last month. The measure trades at 8.3 times 12-month projected
profit after valuations fell in June to the lowest level in at
least five years, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
