Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida displayed courage (and ambition, but that's hardly rare) working to write and pass comprehensive immigration  legislation  in the Senate. Having had the guts to take a risk, naturally, he must  suffer  for it. Here  is Politico, the political stock exchange, reporting on Rubio's share price, the trajectory of which can be gleaned from the public retreat of Rubio and his adviser Todd Harris. The lesson, of course, is that there are far greater rewards in moving with the herd than in trying to change its direction, even if its direction leads over a cliff. While Rubio was working to accomplish something difficult -- to improve the status quo -- most of his likely  rivals  for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination  offered  no constructive proposals. And if immigration reform dies, the do-nothings will be the ones feted (and not only by Politico) for their political savvy.  Rubio is young and talented. Too bad he made the rookie mistake of trying.  (Francis Wilkinson is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
