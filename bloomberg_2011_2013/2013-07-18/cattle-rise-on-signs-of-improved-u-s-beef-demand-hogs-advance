Cattle futures rose for the first
time in three days on signs that lower U.S. beef prices are
boosting demand for the meat. Hogs also gained.  Export sales of beef reached 15,364 metric tons (33.87
pounds) in the week ended July 11, up 5 percent from a week
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Wholesale
 beef  prices are down 10 percent from a record high in May and
dropped yesterday to $1.8944 a pound, the lowest since March 28,
government data show.  “You do have some beef cuts at some very attractive price
levels,”  Christian Mayer , a market analyst at Northstar
Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis , said in a telephone
interview. “You’re seeing buying based on some of the price
levels, and exports were pretty good.”  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 1.1 percent to
$1.26575 a pound at 11:28 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price fell 1.1 percent in the previous two days.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 1 percent
to $1.52475 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement increased 0.4 percent to
85.6 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
