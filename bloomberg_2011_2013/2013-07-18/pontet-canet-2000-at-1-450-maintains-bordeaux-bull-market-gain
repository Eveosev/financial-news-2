A case of 2003  Chateau Latour , a
Bordeaux first-growth wine estate, sold for 7,350 pounds
($11,190) on Liv-ex, marking a 5 percent gain from this year’s
February low while remaining within its 2013 trading range.  Yesterday’s deal compared with the 7,165 pounds paid for a
similar case the previous day, and left the vintage still
trading 29 percent below the 10,300 pound record it reached in
July 2011, when demand for top Bordeaux was peaking.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, fell 2 percent in the second quarter after gaining 7
percent in the first three months, and has slipped further
during July to trade 4 percent up on the year. A muted investor
response to the Bordeaux 2012 sales campaign of the past three
months has also sapped appetite for older vintages.  “Volume is currently low,” William Beck, partner of
London-based Wine Asset Managers LLP, which has $20 million
under management, said in a market report this week. “These are
small movements, similar to those in the second half of 2012.”  The 2003 Latour ranks as the estate’s fourth-highest-priced
wine of the past 15 years, lagging only those from 2010, 2009
and 2000, according to merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its
Cellar Watch website. Yesterday’s price was the highest since a
trade at 7,400 pounds on March 20.  Chateau Latour, with 78 hectares (193 acres) of vineyards,
traces its wine-growing history to at least the 16th century and
has been owned since 1993 by French billionaire  Francois Pinault , according to its  website .  Pauillac Estate  It was one of the first Bordeaux wine estates to install
stainless-steel tanks in its winery in the 1960s and fully
renovated them in 2001. Last year it set another precedent by
announcing it intended to no longer sell wine through the
Bordeaux futures system, instead reserving it for sale closer to
the time when it becomes ready to drink.  Latour is one of the five first-growth wine estates on the
left bank of the Gironde estuary and one of three in the
Pauillac district, along with Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild. The classification was drawn up for
Napoleon III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition, and remains in force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
