Mexico ’s peso bonds declined,
pushing yields up for the first time in three days, as signs of
U.S. economic strength revived speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will curtail stimulus.  Yields on benchmark Mexican government peso bonds due in
2024 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.77
percent at 11:10 a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. They dropped yesterday to 5.73 percent, the lowest
level since July 2. The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 12.5596
per  U.S. dollar .  Mexican debt is “basically reacting to the economic
data,” Alejandro Padilla, a strategist at Grupo Financiero
Banorte SAB, said in a telephone interview from Mexico City.
“With that, we’re seeing a slight correction, a bit of profit
taking, after the big gains.”  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index increased to 19.8 in July from 12.5 the prior month. The
median forecast of 57 economists surveyed by Bloomberg for the
Philadelphia Fed index was 8. Readings greater than zero signal
expansion in eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey  and
Delaware.  U.S. jobless claims dropped by 24,000 to 334,000 in the
week ended July 13, the fewest since early May, Labor Department
figures showed today. Recent fluctuations in the data reflect
difficulty in adjusting for the timing of annual retooling
shutdowns at automakers, a spokesman said as the figures were
released.  Mexico sends about 80 percent of its exports to the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
