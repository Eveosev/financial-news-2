An earthquake rattled central  New
Zealand  today, shaking office towers in capital city Wellington
and sending workers diving under their desks.  The magnitude 5.7 quake struck at 9:06 a.m. local time off
the northern tip of New Zealand’s  South Island , about 46
kilometers (28 miles) southwest of Wellington, at a depth of
just 8 kilometers, according to GNS Science’s  GeoNet service . A
flurry of smaller shocks of as much as magnitude 3.7 followed.  Starting as a tremor, the earthquake built in intensity
until office desks in Wellington shook and high-rise buildings
swayed. It lasted for around 15 seconds. There were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries. The  New Zealand dollar  fell to as
low as 78.8 U.S. cents on the quake before recovering to trade
little changed at 79 cents at 11 a.m.  Workers took to Twitter and Facebook afterward to describe
diving under their desks as the quake hit.  New Zealanders are particularly wary of earthquakes after
185 people died in Christchurch two years ago, when a magnitude
6.3 shake largely destroyed the central city. The nation sits on
the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a belt of volcanic and
earthquake activity related to edge of the tectonic plate below
the  Pacific Ocean .  To contact the reporter on this story:
