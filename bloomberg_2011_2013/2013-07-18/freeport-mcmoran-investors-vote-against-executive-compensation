Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
shareholders voted against approving the compensation of
executives at the world’s largest publicly traded copper
producer.  There were 172 million votes cast at Freeport’s July 16
annual shareholders meeting to approve the compensation and 413
million votes were against, the Phoenix-based company said today
in a filing.  An investor proposal requiring Freeport’s chairman to be an
independent director was approved, as was a proposal allowing
holders of 15 percent of Freeport shares to call a special
investor meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
