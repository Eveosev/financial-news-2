Coffee futures jumped to an eight-week high on concern that cold weather will hurt trees in areas
of  Brazil , the world’s largest producer and exporter. Sugar,
cocoa, cotton and orange juice rose.  A cold front moved into the Brazilian states of  Sao Paulo 
and Parana, bringing as much as 5 inches (13 centimeters) of
rain and freezing temperatures, Somar Meteorologia said in a
report. More precipitation was forecast in the next five to
seven days with freezing temperatures from July 23 to July 25.
Futures climbed for the fourth straight day, the longest rally
in two months.  “Cold temperatures are moving into the coffee belt, and
prices are rallying on frost fears,”  James Cordier , the founder
of Optionsellers.com in Tampa,  Florida , said in a telephone
interview.  Arabica-coffee for September delivery climbed 3.1 percent
to $1.319 a pound at 10:34 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
Earlier, the price reached $1.34, the highest for a most-active
contract since May 21.  Sugar output in Brazil, the top grower, may be hurt by the
wet, cold weather,  Michael McDougall , the head of the Brazil
trading desk at Newedge Group in New York, said in a report.
“If we get further harvest disruptions from rain, you will see
more analysts downgrading Brazil’s cane and sugar production.”  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery gained 1.8 percent
to 16.37 cents a pound on ICE. A close at that price would mark
the biggest gain since June 14. Earlier, the commodity reached
16.45 cents, the highest since July 10.  Cocoa futures for September delivery increased 1.1 percent
to $2,325 a metric ton. Earlier, the price reached $2,328, the
highest since June 13.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
84.1 cents a pound, snapping a two-day slump.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.5
percent to $1.4555 a pound. Earlier, the price reached $1.461,
the highest since June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
