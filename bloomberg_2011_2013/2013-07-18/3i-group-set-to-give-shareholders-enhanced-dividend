3i Group Plc (III) , Britain’s oldest
private-equity firm, said it plans to step up cash returns to
shareholders after reducing debt.  3i will return as much as 20 percent of the 665 million
pounds ($1 billion) it expects to raise from asset sales this
year to shareholders after cutting gross debt, the London-based
company said. The company had said in May it would return the
money if debt fell to less than 1 billion pounds and leverage to
below 20 percent.  “These conditions have now been satisfied and the group
intends to initiate additional shareholder distributions above
the annual base dividend in respect of the financial year ended
31 March 2014,” 3i said today.  3i, which replaced its chief executive officer last year,
is under pressure to halt investments and return money to
shareholders. Activist investor  Edward Bramson , who became
chairman of London-based  F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM)  after ousting
his predecessor, started building a stake in 3i in January.  Gross debt fell to 913 million pounds at June 30, down from
1.08 billion pounds at the end of March, 3i said. Leverage, or
gearing, dropped to 7 percent.  The stock fell 0.6 percent to 379 pence in London trading
for a market value of about 3.7 billion pounds. The stock has
rebounded 74 percent this year.  U.S. Investments  The amount of money available for distributions will be
lower if the company makes additional investments, Chief
Financial Officer Julia Wilson said on conference call with
reporters today. The company said it is again considering making
investments in Northern Europe and the U.S., after focusing the
latter team on selling assets since last year.  Asset sales in the three months through June 30 generated
proceeds of 195 million pounds, up from 119 million pounds in
the year-earlier period, 3i said. Net realized profit was 59
million pounds, driven by the sale of private-equity investments
including British software company Civica Group Ltd.  Net asset value increased 5 percent to 326 pence a share in
the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
