KeyCorp (KEY) ,  Ohio ’s second-largest bank,
said second-quarter profit declined 11 percent on costs related
to a job-cutting program.  Operating net income fell to $193 million, or 21 cents a
share, from $217 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier, the
Cleveland-based lender said today in a statement. The  average
estimate  of 25 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for earnings
of 20 cents a share.  “Compared to the first quarter, cautious client behavior
led to slower loan growth” and “greater-than-anticipated
pressure on our net interest margin,” Chief Executive Officer
Beth Mooney said in the statement.  The lender also said its after-tax gain on the sale of its
Victory Capital Management unit will be between $100 million to
$115 million, less than it previously projected. The company
said it incurred $37 million of costs in the quarter related to
its efficiency initiative, as severance payments helped push
personnel costs up $29 million.  KeyCorp  shares  have gained 38 percent this year, outpacing
the 26 percent advance of the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
