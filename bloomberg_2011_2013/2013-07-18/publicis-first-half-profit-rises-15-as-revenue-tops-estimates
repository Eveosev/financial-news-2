Publicis Groupe SA (PUB) , the third-largest advertising company, said first-half profit rose 15
percent, spurred by growth in the U.S. and revenue from digital
activities.  Net income  climbed to 314 million euros ($411 million) from
273 million euros a year earlier, Paris-based Publicis said in a
statement today. Revenue rose 8.7 percent to 3.35 billion euros,
topping the 3.31 billion-euro average of five analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Maurice Levy  is fueling growth at
Publicis by acquiring digital ad agencies as well as companies
in  emerging markets  such as China. The owner of the Leo Burnett
and Saatchi & Saatchi ad agencies is targeting operating profit
margins of 18 percent to 20 percent by 2018, from 16.1 percent
in 2012, Levy said in April.  Publicis “intends to continue its policy of investing in
the digital sector and in high-growth economies,” the company
said in its statement. Its “robust financial situation” gives
Publicis “the means to successfully implement its strategy.”  The shares rose 2.8 percent to 59.49 euros at 9:40 a.m. in
Paris, taking the company’s market value to 12.6 billion euros.  Growth Forecast  Publicis said it forecasts organic growth for the year of
around 3.6 percent, the top end of the range it had given
previously, helped by a recovery in the U.S. and growth in
digital operations, which now account for 37 percent of sales.  Organic growth in  North America  continued with 6.1 percent
gains in revenue, despite the loss of an advertising contract
last year with General Motors Co. In Europe, it dropped 3.6
percent for the period. Germany saw 3.5 percent growth in the
first half, and the U.K. and France saw slight growth for the
second quarter, though both were negative for the first half.  Southern European countries “were still distinctly in
decline,” with Italy posting a 14.2 percent drop and Spain 8.4
percent, Publicis said.  While 2013 won’t be a “massive investment year,” Publicis
has a range of 400 million euros to 600 million euros to spend
on acquisitions, Levy said in April.  Net new business during the first half totaled $2.8
billion, with brands including  Dunkin’ Donuts , Sprint, PayPal
and  Dairy Queen .  To contact the reporter on this story:
