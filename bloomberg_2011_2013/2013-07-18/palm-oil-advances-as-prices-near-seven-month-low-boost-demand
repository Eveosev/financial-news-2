Palm oil climbed the most in more
than three months as a decline in prices to the lowest level
this year spurred demand for the most consumed cooking oil.  The contract for delivery in October gained 1.8 percent to
close at 2,291 ringgit ($717) a metric ton on the Bursa  Malaysia 
Derivatives, the steepest climb since April 2. Futures fell on
July 16 to the lowest price since Dec. 13. Palm for local
physical delivery in August was at 2,340 ringgit, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Palm oil, used in everything from noodles to biofuels, has
lost 6 percent this year on concerns that slowing economies in
 China  and  India  may curb demand and boost global stockpiles.
Slower output growth in Malaysia last month may support the view
that production is in a “biological low cycle,”  Abah Ofon  and
Samiran Chakraborty, analysts at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote
in a report dated yesterday.  “At the current price levels, there’s consumer buying
interest,” said Donny Khor, deputy director of futures and
commodities at RHB Investment Bank Bhd. Futures may drop if
inventories start to accumulate with a pickup in production in
the second half, he said.  Reserves in Malaysia dropped 37 percent to 1.65 million
tons in June from a record in December. Output, which climbed
2.3 percent last month compared with a 6.3 percent gain in June
2012, is typically the highest from July to October each year.
Exports from Malaysia fell 24 percent to 536,391 tons in the
first 15 days of July, according to surveyor SGS (Malaysia) Sdn.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 0.5 percent
to end at 5,642  yuan  ($919) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange, after closing yesterday at the lowest price for the
most-active contract since July 2009. Soybean oil for delivery
in the same month advanced 0.4 percent to close at 7,272 yuan.  Soybean oil for delivery in December rose 0.2 percent to
45.60 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
delivery in November fell 0.6 percent to $12.7525 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
