The market for corporate borrowing
through  short-term IOUs  climbed from the lowest level in eight
months, led by an increase in issuance from financial
institutions.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S. commercial paper
gained $8.8 billion to $999.2 billion outstanding in the week
ended yesterday, the fourth expansion in six weeks, the  Federal
Reserve  said today on its website. The market advanced after
tumbling $45.2 billion the prior week, the biggest drop in more
than two years, to $990.5 billion outstanding. That was the
lowest level since the period ended Nov. 14.  Commercial paper sold by non-U.S. financial institutions 
rose $2.4 billion to $238.3 billion outstanding, the highest
level since the period ended June 26, while the  amount issued by
U.S.-based banks  increased $10.8 billion to $266.4 billion
outstanding, the highest level in two weeks, Fed data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
