Carole King has always seemed ahead of her time — from her songwriting success at age 18 with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" to her taste in real estate. According to a 2009  Architectural Digest  feature, the singer-songwriter spent nearly 20 years transforming Idaho's  Robinson Bar Ranch  into an environmentally friendly residence heated by hot springs. The 128-acre property is now available for $9.9 million. King has been trying to sell her Stanley, ID green home for several years, asking $19 million in 2007, according to  The Real Estalker blog . The listing hit Zillow for  $16 million in June 2011  and then dropped to $11.9 million later that year. "This ranch features absolute solitude," real estate agent  Stoney Burke of Hall and Hall Partners  writes in the listing description. Originally built in 1870, the main house includes a recording studio, rustic kitchen and living room, 5 bedrooms and 2 baths. Several guest cabins also line the property. King began writing songs in the '60s, but her music career took off in the '70s with "Tapestry" remaining on the charts until Michael Jackson's "Thriller" in 1982. More recently, she and James Taylor completed a "Live at the Troubadour" reunion tour. "Home is very important to me and consistently shows up in my lyrics," King told Architectural Digest in December 2009. "But this house, more than any I've had, gives me the sense of being wrapped in the warm blanket of nature." The ranch is surrounded by the Salmon-Challis National Forest and overlooks Warm Springs Creek.
