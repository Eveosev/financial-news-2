Malaysia’s 10-year bonds rose for
the first time in five days after the U.S. allayed concern it is
preparing to cut stimulus that has spurred fund flows to
 emerging markets . The ringgit was steady.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks reached its highest
level in more than a month. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told the House Financial Services Committee yesterday
the central bank’s asset purchases “are by no means on a preset
course” and could even be expanded should economic conditions
warrant. The ringgit fell 1.2 percent in the past month as
foreign funds reduced holdings of the nation’s stocks amid
speculation the Fed will scale back its bond buying.  “The risk appetite is better because, at the margin,
Bernanke’s statement sounded like there are dovish
inclinations,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based
economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. “The ringgit will likely move
within a tight range in the near term.”  The yield on the 3.48 percent notes due March 2023 declined
one basis point to 3.84 percent as of 9:51 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate touched 3.85
percent yesterday, the highest since the securities were sold in
March. ING Groep NV recommends investors buy the notes,
predicting the yield will fall to 3.6 percent by year-end,
according to a note today by  Tim Condon , Singapore-based head of
Asia Research.  The ringgit was at 3.1937 per dollar, little changed from
yesterday’s close of 3.1925, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 7.60 percent.  Bernanke said on June 19 that its $85 billion in monthly
bond buying may be tapered this year and ended in 2014 if the
 U.S. economy  performs in line with its projections. Overseas
funds sold a net 3.5 billion ringgit ($1.1 billion) of Malaysian
stocks in June, exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
