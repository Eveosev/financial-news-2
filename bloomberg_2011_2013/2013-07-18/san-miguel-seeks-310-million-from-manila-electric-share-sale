San Miguel  Corp. is seeking to raise
$310 million from selling part of its stake in  Manila Electric (MER) 
Co., the largest power retailer in the Philippines.  Manila-based San Miguel is offering 46.3 million to 48
million Manila Electric shares at 270 pesos to 280 pesos apiece,
according to terms for the transaction obtained by  Bloomberg
News . The price range is a 7.4 percent to 10.7 percent discount
to the stock’s closing price today. San Miguel has an option to
increase the sale by $75 million, the terms show.  The sale of part of its 32.8 percent stake in Manila
Electric will help San Miguel raise the funds it needs to expand
beyond beer and food production. The Philippines’ most
acquisitive company plans to spend $35 billion to transform into
an investor in energy, mining, airlines and roads. The company
announced 40 purchases worth $7.8 billion since 2000.  “This certainly eases speculation over San Miguel’s
ability to cover its debt in light of the big infrastructure
projects it’s getting into,”  James Lago , head of research at
Manila-based PCCI Securities Brokers Corp., said by phone today.
“The proceeds can also fund these projects.”  San Miguel Chief Financial Officer Ferdinand Constantino
and spokeswoman Jane Llanes weren’t immediately reachable when
telephoned at their offices. Phone calls to the offices of
Manila Electric President Oscar Reyes and Chief Financial
Officer Betty Siy-Yap weren’t answered.  Manila Electric shares rose 3.1 percent to 302.40 pesos at
the close of trading today. San Miguel climbed 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
