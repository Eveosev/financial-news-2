A Bizarro World political map of the United States might look something like the above. Blue states are red! Red states are blue!  Cats and dogs living together !  It's not a political map — but it is bizarre. It's the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's  June 2013 U.S. Climate Update . It's a picture of a hot, wet America -- half a Fahrenheit degree and almost a full inch above the 20th century averages for temperature and precipitation.  The blue areas aren't exempted from  global weirding  just because they've had a cool spell. Cooler temperatures in the Midwest helped delay snowmelt and bring rain that caused record river levels this spring. The wet-dry divide is visible from a related map, showing the bone-dry West and inundated Mississippi River basin.  The  global picture  isn't much prettier. The average land and ocean surface temperatures made June 2013 tie with June 2006 as the fifth-hottest since 1880, more than one degree Fahrenheit above the 20th century average. The last month to record global average temperatures below the 20th century average was February 1985.  "For the first six months of 2013, the contiguous United States has been nearly split in half by temperature and precipitation differences," NOAA states in its June U.S. update. Americans are divided about so much these days — health-care reform, climate policy, Honey Boo Boo. Add to the list that they are divided by the climate itself.
