Canadian  wholesale sales  rose at the
fastest pace in more than two years in May, reaching a record on
sales of fertilizer and food.  Sales rose 2.3 percent to C$50.3 billion ($48.3 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, compared with the median
estimate for a 0.3 percent gain in a Bloomberg  survey  with 15
responses.  The  Bank of Canada  is counting on business investment and
exports to drive growth, saying yesterday the world’s 11th-largest economy won’t reach full capacity until mid-2015 because
of weak foreign demand and slower housing investment. Today’s
report showed the pace of wholesale sales  over the last year  was
0.8 percent.  “It was a good number, no doubt about that,” said  Krishen Rangasamy , senior economist at National Bank Financial in
 Montreal , adding Canada isn’t  “out of the woods because
domestic demand remains soft” along with exports.  The Canadian dollar was 0.1 percent weaker at C$1.0419 per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:03 a.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 95.98 U.S.
cents.  Agricultural supplies such as fertilizer led the May gain
with a jump of 19.6 percent to C$2.63 billion, Statistics Canada
said today. Earlier this week, the agency reported that
fertilizer purchases also boosted May factory sales.  Food sales rose 4.2 percent to C$8.78 billion while  motor
vehicle  and parts gained 1.4 percent to C$8.44 billion.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, advanced 2.4 percent in May.  Inventories were little changed at C$61.8 billion, lowering
the inventory-to-sales  ratio  to 1.23 in May from 1.26 in April.  Statistics Canada  today also revised higher its estimate of
the April wholesale sales gain to 0.4 percent from an earlier
0.2 percent.  The agency also said today that the number of Canadians
receiving jobless benefits fell 2.4 percent in May from the
previous month, or by 12,290 to 508,510. From the year-ago
month, the number of beneficiaries fell 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
