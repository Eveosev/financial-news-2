South Korea’s bonds rose, pushing
the three-year yield to the lowest in a month, and the won
strengthened after the Federal Reserve calmed concern about a
possible cut in its asset-buying program.  The U.S. central bank will respond to economic data and may
even increase its purchases if indicators don’t meet its
expectations, Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told the House Financial
Services Committee yesterday. His comments in May and June that
the Fed may taper the program, which has driven emerging-market
inflows, sparked a slide in Asian currencies and debt. Overseas
investors bought $253 million more South Korean shares than they
sold this week as of yesterday, exchange data show.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government notes due June
2016 fell five basis points to 2.84 percent as of 10:26 a.m. in
 Seoul , according to Korea Exchange Inc. prices. That’s the
lowest level since June 19. The won advanced 0.1 percent to
1,120.75 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency fell 0.3 percent yesterday.  “The market took Bernanke’s testimony as dovish, easing
concern that the tapering is imminent, which lifted market
sentiment,” said D.J. Park, a fixed-income analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in Seoul. “Investors are not aggressively buying
as they may be still interpreting his comments.”  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, dropped 35 basis
points, or 0.35 percentage point, to 8.01 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
