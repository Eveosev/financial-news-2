Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA) ,  Colombia ’s largest
publicly traded food company, rallied after agreeing to pay
$758 million for Tresmontes Lucchetti SA.  The shares increased 1.1 percent to 24,880 pesos at 2:30
p.m. in Bogota, the highest level since June 18 on a closing
basis. The Colcap Index gained 0.4 percent.  The Medellin-based maker of Zenu cold cuts and Jet
chocolates said today in a regulatory filing that the
acquisition would give it nine production plants in  Chile  and
distribution in  Mexico . The deal is expected to close by
October, according to the filing. Tresmontes Lucchetti, a
Santiago food company, filed a plan in March for an initial
public offering.  “We want to point out the contribution to profit it will
have,” Nutresa’s Chief Executive Officer Carlos Enrique Piedrahita said in the filing. The purchase “will contribute
key elements like our entry to the Chilean market.”  Nutresa said it would meet a 10-year goal of tripling sales
earlier than its 2015 target. Tresmontes Lucchetti posted
revenue of $440 million last year, compared with Nutresa’s 5.3
trillion pesos ($2.8 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
