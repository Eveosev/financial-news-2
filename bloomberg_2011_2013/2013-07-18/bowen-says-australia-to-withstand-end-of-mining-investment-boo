Australia’s economy will remain
resilient as the mining-investment boom peaks, with increased
exports and a pick up in other industries supporting growth, the
nation’s new Treasurer  Chris Bowen  said.  The economy “will begin to return to normal” in the next
two years, Bowen said in a speech to journalists in Canberra
today. The transition “will be challenging,” said Bowen, a key
backer of returned Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd .  Rudd and Bowen are seeking to reframe the economic debate
by highlighting the risks from a Chinese slowdown and spending
cutbacks if  Tony Abbott ’s opposition wins power in elections due
by Nov. 30. Predecessors Julia Gillard and  Wayne Swan  saw their
credibility dented when the government abandoned a pledge to
return the budget to surplus last fiscal year.  “Who is best placed to manage and engineer this transition
will be a key battleground –- the key battleground in this
election,” Bowen said. “Our challenge is to manage this
transitional period. From the mining investment phase to the
production phase, from resources investment to investment in
services, manufacturing and clean energy. We need to ensure this
is as smooth as possible and the bumps are minimal.”  Australia ’s relatively strong economic performance is
expected to continue, Bowen said, with growth over the next two
years expected to exceed that of advanced economies as a whole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
