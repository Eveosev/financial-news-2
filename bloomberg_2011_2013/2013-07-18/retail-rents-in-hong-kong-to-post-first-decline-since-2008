Hong Kong ’s retail rents will post
their first annual decline since 2008 this year as mainland
Chinese shoppers spend less on luxury fashion and goods,
according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.  Prime street retail rents in Causeway Bay, home to the
world’s most expensive shopping area, will fall 4 percent in
2013, Michelle Woo, Hong Kong-based executive director for
retail at the realtor, said in a briefing yesterday. Those in
the Central business district is projected to decline 3.5
percent, Woo said.  Retailers are expecting spending by Chinese shoppers to
slow as pledge by the government to limit additional stimulus
adds to the risk of a deeper economic slowdown, Cushman said.
China’s economy grew 7.5 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, slowing for a second straight period.  “Many brands already said they won’t open new shops in
the second half,” Woo said. “People won’t blindly chase after
retail spots now.”  Monthly rents in Causeway Bay, where companies including
 Wharf Holdings Ltd. (4)  and  Hysan Development Co. (14)  operate shopping
malls, fell 2.5 percent in the first half to HK$1,950 ($251) a
square foot, the New York-based broker said. Central, home to
 Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. (16) ’s IFC Mall, recorded rent dropping
2.6 percent to HK$1,480, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
