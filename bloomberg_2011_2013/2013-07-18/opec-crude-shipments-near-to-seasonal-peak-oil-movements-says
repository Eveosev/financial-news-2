Crude shipments from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rose to near their
highest for the year as refiners have purchased most of their
requirements for the peak summer season, Oil Movements said.  The group, which supplies about 40 percent of the world’s
oil, will export 24.16 million barrels a day in the four weeks
to Aug. 3, an increase of 40,000 barrels from 24.12 million in
the period to July 6, the tanker tracker said today in an e-mailed report. The figures exclude two of OPEC’s 12 members,
 Angola  and  Ecuador .  “This is the end of the spike as all of the crude needed
is on the water for loading in August,” Roy Mason, the
company’s founder, said today by phone from Halifax,  England .  Middle Eastern shipments will climb 0.2 percent to 1.81
million barrels a day to August 3, compared with 17.78 million
in the month to July 6, according to Oil Movements. That figure
includes non-OPEC nations Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will increase by 5.5 percent to
500.49 million barrels versus 474.41 million, data from Oil
Movements show. The researcher calculates the volumes by
tallying tanker bookings. Its figures exclude crude held on
vessels for storage.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. It will next meet in Vienna on Dec. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
