A Michigan judge temporarily barred
the state’s governor and  Detroit ’s emergency manager from taking
any action that would allow cuts in pension benefits for city
retirees.  Ingham County Circuit Court Judge Rosemarie E. Aquilina
rejected a bid by the General Retirement System and the Police
and Fire Retirement System of the City of Detroit to block the
city’s bankruptcy filing. The pension funds sued yesterday
seeking to stop the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
