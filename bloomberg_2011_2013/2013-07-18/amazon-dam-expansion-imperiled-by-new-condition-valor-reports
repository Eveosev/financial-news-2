The expansion of Brazil’s Santo
Antonio hydroelectric dam in the Amazon region may be canceled
after regulators said part of the extra energy would have to be
transferred to a neighboring project,  Valor Economico  said,
citing a document filed to the country’s Energy Ministry.  The group responsible for the 1.5 billion-real ($670
million) expansion, led by construction company Odebrecht SA and
a unit of state-run utility  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET3) ,
notified the ministry it may scrap the plan because of the
rules, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Santo Antonio would have to hand over part of the extra
power because the plan would hinder the potential expansion of
the nearby Jirau hydroelectric project, according to a ruling
from electricity regulator Aneel, Valor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
