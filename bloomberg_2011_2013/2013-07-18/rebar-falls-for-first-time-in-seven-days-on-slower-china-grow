Shanghai fell for the first time in seven days on the prospect
of slower economic growth in  China .  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures

time. Futures rose to 3,705 yuan yesterday, the highest price

investment, the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday,
citing China Iron & Steel Association vice chairman Liu
Zhenjiang.  “Investors aren’t optimistic on the economic growth
outlook in the second-half of this year,” said Wu Zhili, an
analyst at Shenhua Futures Co. in  Shanghai .  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port advanced
