Gasoline on the  spot market  in New
York Harbor weakened after Phillips 66 completed maintenance
work at its Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey.  Phillips 66 spokesman  Rich Johnson  said work was finished
at the 238,000-barrel-a-day plant, the closest refinery to New
York. Johnson said July 15 that maintenance was under way there.  Reformulated 84-octane blendstock , or RBOB, in New York
weakened by 0.5 cent to a 5.5-cent-a-gallon premium to gasoline
futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:06 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional, 87-octane
gasoline there weakened by 0.62 cent to 11.75 cents below
futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York strengthened by 0.5
cent to a discount of 0.25 cent to ULSD futures on the Nymex.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a rough measure of
refining margins based on Brent oil, climbed 41 cents to $22.76
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
