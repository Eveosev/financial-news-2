The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority is investigating whether high-frequency traders have
established controls to ensure their algorithms don’t
malfunction and cause broader harm to markets.  Finra sent letters this week to about 10 trading firms
asking nine detailed questions about how they use and deploy
algorithms, according to George Smaragdis, a spokesman for the
U.S. brokerage industry’s self-regulator. Finra had expressed
concern about how firms supervise trading algorithms after
Knight Capital Group Inc. bombarded exchanges in August with
mistaken orders that cost the company $400 million.  The examination, described in a letter on Finra’s website,
as part of an effort to explore technology controls more deeply,
according to exam priorities the Washington-based regulator
published in January. Finra asks firms in the letter to disclose
whether they use kill switches to halt individual algorithms and
under what conditions they would shut off trading.  “In light of several high-profile algorithmic trading
failures that caused significant market disruption in 2012,
Finra continues to be concerned about how firms are  supervising
the development of algorithms and trading systems,” the
regulator said in a document laying out examination priorities
for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
