CLSA Securities  Japan  Co. hired
Walter Altherr as a non-banks financial analyst in  Tokyo ,
according to Gary Hopkinson, country head of the brokerage.  Altherr, 53, wrote “Bid Only,” a Wall Street thriller set
in Tokyo, and previously covered consumer finance companies at
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in Japan. In 2008, he stopped
covering consumer lender  Aiful Corp. (8515)  after the Japanese company
threatened to sue Lehman when Altherr called it “arguably
insolvent.” Lehman stopped coverage of Japan’s consumer lenders
and retracted research on the industry.  CLSA hired Altherr “to strengthen our breadth of coverage.
It is an area where we had a hole,” Hopkinson said in an e-mail. “With the current interest in the Japanese stock market,
this sector is becoming increasingly more attractive to global
investors.”  The Topix index has surged more than 40 percent this year
to become the world’s best performing major equity benchmark, on
optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  will
beat 15 years of deflation. The Topix Securities Index tracking
the nation’s brokerages has surged 74 percent year-to-date, the
best performing of the 33 Topix sub-sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
