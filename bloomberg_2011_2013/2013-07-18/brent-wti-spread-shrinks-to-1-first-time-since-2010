The  difference  between the world’s
two most-traded crude oil grades shrank to less than $1 a barrel
for the first time in about 2 1/2 years amid declining crude
inventories in the U.S.  North Sea Brent crude’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
narrowed to as little as 90 cents a barrel today, slipping to
less than $1 for the first time since Nov. 12, 2010. WTI, the
main U.S. crude grade, had been typically the more expensive
grade until mid-2010. The convergence between Brent, a gauge for
more than half the world’s oil, and WTI shows how improved
pipeline networks and the use of rail links have helped to
unlock a glut at America’s oil-storage hub at Cushing,  Oklahoma .  The nation’s  crude inventories  fell by 6.9 million barrels
last week to 367 million in their third weekly decrease, the
longest run of declines this year, as refiners processed the
most crude in almost eight years, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, part of the Energy Department, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
