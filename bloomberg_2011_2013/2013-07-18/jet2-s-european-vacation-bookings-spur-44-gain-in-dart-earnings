Jet2.com , the U.K. discount airline
specializing in flights from northern  England , spurred annual
earnings at parent  Dart Group Plc (DTG)  44 percent following a surge
in bookings to its European holiday destinations.  Dart’s pretax profit jumped to 40.5 million pounds ($61
million) in the 12 months ended March 31, it said today in a
statement, with sales gaining 27 percent to 869 million pounds
and beating the 755 million-pound average estimate of analysts.  Jet2, which serves eight northern bases with its main hub
at Leeds-Bradford airport, lifted scheduled passenger numbers 13
percent to 4.84 million, while the Jet2holidays vacation unit
almost doubled the customer total to more than 417,000. Dart
raise its dividend almost 50 percent to 1.33 pence per share.  “Overall demand for seats, boosted by demand from
Jet2holidays, resulted in higher load factors and increased
yield,” Chairman Philip Meeson said in the release, adding that
the airline arm has boosted capacity 12 percent this summer.  Dart shares  rose as much as 8.8 percent, the biggest gain
since May 13, and were trading 7.9 percent higher at 233 pence
as of 8:44 p.m. in  London , taking gains this year to 85 percent
and valuing the company at 338 million pounds.  Jet2holidays will maintain growth in the current year, with
forward bookings “at encouraging levels,” Meeson said, though
margins at the airline business, which operated 45  Boeing Co. (BA) 
single-aisle jets in the fiscal year, will remain “challenging.”  Dart said that revenue from postal flights performed for
Britain’s  Royal Mail  will decline after the airline was told it
will retain only six of eight routes and that current contracts,
due to expire next year, will be put out to competitive tender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
