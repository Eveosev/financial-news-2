Copper swung between gains and
losses as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  allayed
concern that stimulus in the U.S. will end soon while more signs
emerged that demand may slow in China.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $6,882.75 a metric ton at 10:39
a.m. in Tokyo after trading between a 0.4 percent gain and 0.4
percent loss. Futures for delivery in September on the Comex
lost 0.3 percent to $3.1185 a pound.  Bernanke said in prepared testimony to the House Financial
Services Committee yesterday that the Fed’s asset purchases
“are by no means on a preset course” and could even be
expanded should economic conditions warrant. The  International
Monetary Fund  said that risks are increasing that  China ’s
economic growth this year will trail the lender’s forecast.  “Bernanke’s comments were supportive for copper, while
there’s concern over China’s economic growth,” said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in
Seoul. Investors will watch U.S. jobless claims report today for
direction, he said.  First-time claims  for jobless benefits probably decreased
by 15,000 to 345,000 in the week ended July 13, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the
Labor Department data today.  Copper futures for delivery in November on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange declined 0.9 percent to 49,450  yuan  ($8,054 a
ton.  On the LME, nickel, aluminum and tin also fell, while zinc
climbed and lead was little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
