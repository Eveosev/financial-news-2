Gold futures advanced for the third
time in four days on signs of increasing physical purchases.  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,  Japan ’s biggest gold retailer,
said today its sales rose threefold in the second quarter from
the previous three months, as lower prices attracted consumers.
There are signs of firming demand from  China  to Japan, Barclays
Plc wrote in a July 15 report. Prices rebounded 9 percent since
reaching a 34-month low on June 28 as the decline spurred more
buying of coins, bars and jewelry.  “Physical demand is keeping the gold market alive,”
Sterling Smith, a Chicago-based commodity futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc., said in a telephone interview. “We also saw
some technical buying come in.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,285.50 an ounce at 1:40 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal touched $1,301.10 yesterday, the highest since
June 21, before erasing gains.  Bullion has tumbled 23 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in the commodity as a store of value amid an equity
rally and muted inflation.  “One reason gold prices are lower is people are less
concerned about extreme outcomes, particularly negative
outcomes, and therefore they feel less need for whatever
protection gold affords,” Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said during under questioning from the Senate Banking
Committee. “A lot of people hold gold as an inflation hedge,
but the movements of gold don’t predict inflation very well,
actually.”  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery added 0.3 percent to $1,414.80 an ounce. In the
spot market, one ounce of platinum bought as much as 1.1118
ounces of gold, the most since August 2011.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$19.389 an ounce on the Comex. Palladium futures for September
delivery jumped 1.6 percent to $747.50 an ounce on the Nymex,
the biggest gain in more than a week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
