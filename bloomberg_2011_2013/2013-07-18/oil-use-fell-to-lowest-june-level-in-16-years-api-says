U.S. petroleum use fell in June to
the lowest level for the month in 16 years as domestic
production climbed, the  American Petroleum Institute  said.  Total petroleum deliveries, a measure of demand, dropped 1
percent from a year earlier to 18.7 million barrels a day, the
least for the month since 1997, the API said today in a report.
Production jumped 15 percent to 7.22 million barrels a day, the
highest June output since 1991.  “The latest data continues to reflect the uncertainty
visible in the broader economy,”  John Felmy , chief economist at
the API, said in a statement.  Gasoline deliveries slid 1.9 percent from a year earlier to
8.87 million barrels a day, the lowest level for June since
2001, the API said. Demand for distillate fuels including diesel
increased 5.5 percent to 3.94 million barrels a day.  Jet fuel use decreased 4.8 percent to 1.47 million barrels
a day. Demand for all other oils, a category that includes
liquefied petroleum gas, fell 0.9 percent to 4.17 million.  Oil production rose 16 percent in the lower 48 states to
6.71 million barrels a day and increased 3.2 percent to 509,000
in  Alaska .  For the second quarter, gasoline demand dropped 2 percent
to 8.78 million barrels a day. Total petroleum consumption was
18.6 million barrels a day, down 0.3 percent from a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
