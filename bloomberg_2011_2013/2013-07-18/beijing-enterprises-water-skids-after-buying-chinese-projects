Beijing Enterprises Water Group
Ltd. (371) , a water-treatment systems developer, fell the most in more
than three weeks a day after announcing plans to buy water
assets in China.  The shares skidded 3.2 percent today in Hong Kong, the
biggest drop since June 25, on double the stockâ€™s three-month
average daily volume following the 1.35 billion  yuan  ($220
million) acquisition of two units involved in 36 water projects
in China from Standard Water Ltd.  Twelve analysts rate Beijing Enterprises Water as a buy,
four as a hold and one a sell, according to Bloomberg data. The
stock has more than doubled, rising 122 percent, over the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
