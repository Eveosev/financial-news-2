About 14 percent of smartphone and
tablet owners used them to watch television in the past six
months, according to a survey by researcher  Parks Associates .  People ages 18 to 34 were more open to using mobile apps
for entertainment, citing convenience as an attraction, while
older consumers had little interest, the Dallas-based researcher
found. Overall about 25 percent of survey respondents expressed
interest in using apps.  Networks are introducing apps for smartphones and tablets
ahead of the TV season that starts in September, giving
consumers new ways to access shows and information about their
favorite programs. Of those who had used apps for TV in the past
six months, more than 60 percent said they watched less than
three times a month.  “Usage is still a little light,”  John Barrett , director
of consumer analytics at Parks Associates, said in an interview.
“It’s not necessarily something people do every time they watch
the show or channel because that would at lest be a weekly
activity.”  Nine percent of app users accessed them daily or almost
daily. Shows with popular apps include “The Walking Dead” on
AMC and “Glee,” shown on  Fox network , in addition to  Viacom
Inc. (VIAB) ’s MTV and Nickelodeon channels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
