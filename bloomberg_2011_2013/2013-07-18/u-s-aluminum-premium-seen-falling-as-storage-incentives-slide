The premium aluminum buyers are
expected to pay for supplies in the U.S. fell for the first time
this year as warehouse companies scaled back incentives offered
to fill their sheds, according to  Harbor Intelligence .  The premium slid to 11.8 to 12 cents a pound this week from
a record 12 to 13 cents, Jorge Vazquez, managing director of the
Austin, Texas-based researcher, said by e-mail today. Storage
incentives dropped to 8.6 cents a pound from 10.5 cents and are
poised to slide further, he said.  Warehouse companies offer incentives to draw metal into
their sites, competing with consumers for supplies. Incentives
started to fall after the London Metal Exchange on July 1
proposed requiring warehouses where withdrawals take longer than
100 calendar days to ship out more metal than they take in.
Waiting times in  Detroit , which holds 80 percent of U.S.
aluminum  stockpiles  tracked by the LME, exceed 100 days.  “The market is almost dead in terms of volume as
participants have stepped to the sidelines expecting lower
premiums,” Vazquez said. “One may argue that one of the
reasons why premiums have fallen slightly is the really low-volume context. Only urgent, low-volume transactions have taken
place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
