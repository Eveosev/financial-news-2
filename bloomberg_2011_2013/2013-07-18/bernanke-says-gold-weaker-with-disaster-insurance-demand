Gold prices have fallen this year
because investors see a reduced need for “disaster insurance,”
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said.  “One reason gold prices are lower is people are less
concerned about extreme outcomes, particularly negative
outcomes, and therefore they feel less need for whatever
protection gold affords,” he said today under questioning from
the Senate Banking Committee. “A lot of people hold gold as an
inflation hedge but the movements of gold don’t predict
inflation very well actually.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1,285.40 an ounce at 12:48 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
metal touched $1,301.10 yesterday, the highest since June 21,
before erasing gains.  Bullion tumbled 24 percent this year through yesterday as
some investors lost faith in the commodity as a store of value
amid an equity rally and muted inflation.  “Nobody really understands gold prices and I don’t pretend
to really understand them either,” Bernanke told the lawmakers
in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
