Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , South Africa’s
largest wireless operator, said revenue rose 3 percent in the
second quarter to 17.5 billion rand ($1.77 billion) as more
customers switched to smartphones.  Vodacom, which is 65 percent-owned by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
boosted subscriber numbers by 5.3 percent in the three months
through June to 51.5 million as international operations
continued to expand, the company said in a statement today.  “Data and the International operations remain key parts of
the growth story,” Chief Executive Officer Shameel Joosub said
in the statement.  Vodacom is becoming increasingly important for its Newbury,
England-based parent as Vodafone seeks ways to offset a slide in
its European businesses.  Vodacom  shares  rose 1.4 percent to 115.08 rand as of 12:53
p.m. in Johannesburg trading. The stock has declined 7.2 percent
this year, compared with a 3.6 percent gain by  MTN Ltd. (MTN) , South
Africa’s second-biggest operator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
