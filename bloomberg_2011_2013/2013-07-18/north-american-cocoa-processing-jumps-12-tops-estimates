Cocoa processing in  North America 
jumped 12 percent in the second quarter, topping estimates by
analysts, as gains in the  U.S. economy  spur demand from
chocolate makers.  Grindings, a measure of consumption, rose to 126,044 metric
tons from 112,768 tons a year earlier, the Washington-based
 National Confectioners Association  said today in a  report  on its
website. On average, traders and analysts expected an increase
of 4.4 percent to 117,762 tons, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Processing rose 5.8 percent in the first quarter.  The U.S. economy will expend 2.3 percent to 2.6 percent
this year and 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 2014, Federal Reserve
officials have said. Chocolate sales climbed 6.3 percent in June
from a year earlier, according to data from research company IRI
compiled by Bloomberg Industries.  “The economy is improving, and that leads to more consumer
discretionary income, which can be spent on candy bars and
chocolate ice cream,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at
Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Cocoa for September delivery increased 2 percent to close
at $2,347 a metric ton today on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .
The price reached $2,352, the highest for a most-active contract
since June 13. The commodity has climbed 6.5 percent in the past
12 months.  Companies including Hershey Co., Mars Inc. and Nestle SA
were surveyed by the confectioner group.  The Singapore-based Cocoa Association of Asia said
yesterday that the region’s grind climbed 2 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier. The Brussels-based European
Cocoa Association said on July 15 that processing rose 6.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
