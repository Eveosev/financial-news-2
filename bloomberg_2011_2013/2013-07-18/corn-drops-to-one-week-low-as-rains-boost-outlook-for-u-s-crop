Corn declined for a second day to
the lowest level in more than a week on a forecast for rains in
the U.S. Midwest, helping ease concern that crop stress will
hurt a record harvest in the world’s largest grower and exporter.  The contract for delivery in December fell as much as 1.4
percent to $4.95 a bushel, the lowest price since July 8.
Futures were at $4.975 by 10:12 a.m. in Singapore on volume that
was 88 percent above the 100-day average for that time of day.  A storm will move through the Corn Belt in the middle of
next week, helping ensure rainfall will be near normal in most
areas, Accuweather.com said yesterday. Conditions had
deteriorated as dry weather persisted, with the share of the
crop that’s rated good-to-excellent  dropping  to 66 percent as of
July 14 from 68 percent a week earlier, government data show.  “There’s certainly been a potential improvement in
forecasts over the last 24 hours, particularly in the drier
parts of the U.S. western Corn Belt,”  Michael Pitts , a
commodity sales director at National Australia Bank Ltd., said
by phone from Sydney today. “If that comes to a fruition, and
we don’t get any heat, then that should push us most of the way
through the most dangerous part of the corn season.”  About 16 percent of corn was at the silking stage as of
July 14, behind a five-year average of 35 percent, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said July 15. Silking is part of the
pollination stage when drought and high temperatures can hurt
yields, according to the  Ohio State  University Extension website.
Futures slid 29 percent this year as U.S. farmers planted a
record crop, estimated by the USDA at 13.95 billion bushels.  Soybeans for November delivery lost as much as 1.3 percent
to $12.6625 a bushel before trading at $12.7575. Wheat for
delivery in September slipped 0.2 percent to $6.6375 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
