Amphenol Corp. (APH) , which makes fiber-optic connectors and other telecommunications equipment for
companies such as Apple Inc., fell the most in more than four
years after cutting its profit and sales forecasts for the year.  The shares slid 9.7 percent to $76.35, the biggest one-day
drop since December 2008. Before the tumble, the stock had
climbed 31 percent this year.  Amphenol lowered its forecast for 2013 earnings to $3.73 to
$3.79 a share from an earlier projection of $3.76 to $3.85.
Revenue will reach $4.49 billion to $4.54 billion, down from a
prior view of $4.58 billion to $4.66 billion, the Wallingford,
Connecticut-based company said today in a statement.  Amphenol, whose customers also include Samsung Electronics
Co. and Verizon Communications Inc., said it’s finding the
mobile-device market increasingly difficult to predict. The
weaker numbers reflect lower-than-expected demand for the
gadgets, said Steven Fox, an analyst at Cross Research in
Livingston, New Jersey.  “This is a company that has an incredible track record of
not missing estimates,” said Fox, who advises buying the
shares. “It’s a reflection of more conservative orders from
smartphone and tablet makers.”  Amphenol has  beat  analysts’ profit estimates each quarter
since the end of 2005, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It last  cut  a profit forecast in 2011.  Amphenol’s second-quarter earnings were 95 cents a share,
exceeding analysts’ projections of 94 cents a share, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , is scheduled to
report earnings July 23 for the quarter that ended in June. In
April, it announced a sales forecast for the quarter that fell
short of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
