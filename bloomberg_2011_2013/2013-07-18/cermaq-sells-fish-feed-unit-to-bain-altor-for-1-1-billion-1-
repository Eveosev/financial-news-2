Cermaq ASA (CEQ)  said it agreed to sell
its Ewos fish-feed unit to Bain Capital LLC and Altor Equity
Partners in a deal that values the business at 6.5 billion
kroner ($1.1 billion).  The price, which is 300 million kroner more than indicated
when the deal was announced on June 17, will be paid in cash and
is expected to close by the end of October, the Oslo-based
company said in a statement today. Cermaq will use the money to
reduce its debt, fund its salmon-farming operations and to pay
an extraordinary dividend of between 48 kroner and 54 kroner a
share, it said.  Cermaq, in which the Norwegian government owns a  59.2
percent stake , held talks about selling units after snubbing a
takeover bid from  Marine Harvest ASA (MHG)  as too low. The company
will now focus on its farming unit, which has operations in
Chile, Canada and  Norway .  “Cermaq supports a further consolidation of the farming
industry in selected geographical areas and will consider
various solutions to further develop the company’s strong
position,” it said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
