Natural gas futures jumped in  New
York  to the highest price in more than three weeks after U.S.
stockpiles climbed by less than forecast last week.  Gas gained as much as 5.3 percent after the Energy
Information Administration said inventories rose 58 billion
cubic feet in the week ended July 12 to 2.745 trillion. Analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed an injection of 65
billion. Gas has risen in four of the past five days as
scorching Northeast weather boosted demand from  power plants .  “The number was below expectations and we’re starting to
see some intense heat in the heavy gas-consuming areas of the
Northeast,” said Kent Bayazitoglu, an analyst at Gelber &
Associates in Houston. “Gas demand has been going up quite a
bit.”  Natural gas for August delivery surged 18.2 cents, or 5
percent, to $3.811 per million British thermal units at 12:28
p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Volume was 46 percent
above the 100-day average. The futures reached $3.819, the
highest intraday price since June 24. Prices have gained 14
percent this year.  The discount of August to October futures narrowed 0.8 cent
to 0.6 cent.  August $3.65 calls were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were 11.5 cents higher at 17.5 cents
per million Btu on volume of 513 at 12:15 p.m. Calls accounted
for 53 percent of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in August was 29.66 percent at 12:15
p.m., compared with 30.61 percent yesterday.  Average Gain  A survey of Bloomberg users predicted an injection of 64
billion cubic feet. The stockpile increase was smaller than the
five-year average gain for the week of 70 billion cubic feet,
department data show. A  deficit  to the five-year average was 1.2
percent compared with 0.8 percent the previous week.  Supplies were 13.1 percent below year-earlier inventories,
compared with 14.2 percent in last week’s report.  MDA Weather Services in Gaitherburg,  Maryland , predicted
above-normal temperatures in most of the lower-48 states from
July 23 through July 27.  The high in  Dallas  on July 25 may be 100 degrees Fahrenheit
(38 Celsius), 3 higher than average, according to  AccuWeather
Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in  St. Louis  may
be 91 degrees, 2 more than usual.  Power generation accounts for 32 percent of U.S. gas
demand, according to the Energy Information Administration, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm.  Production Estimate  The U.S. cut its 2013 marketed natural gas production
estimate to 69.96 billion cubic feet a day from a June forecast
of 70.01 billion, the EIA said July 9 in in its Short-Term
Energy Outlook. Output may rise 1.1 percent from 2012 to a
record as onshore supplies climb.  Stockpiles may total 3.809 trillion cubic feet at the end
of October, about 120 billion below last year’s peak, the EIA
said.  The U.S. met 89 percent of its own energy needs in March,
the highest monthly rate since April 1986, EIA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
