Zhang Xinliang, a former employee of
billionaire investor  George Soros ’s family office, started his
own Hong Kong-based hedge-fund company, Magnolia Capital
Management Ltd.  Magnolia was licensed by the city’s Securities and Futures
Commission on April 18, according to information posted on the
regulator’s website.  Zhang, also known as Nick Zhang, was licensed by the
regulator as a representative of  Soros Fund Management  LLC’s
 Hong Kong  office between January 2011 and December 2012. Soros
Fund Management oversaw $24 billion earlier this year. Zhang
worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before Soros Fund
Management, according to his licensing  record .  Zhang is the son-in-law of Wang Yang, having married the
only daughter of the Chinese vice premier some years ago, Hong
Kong’s South China Morning Post reported today, quoting
unidentified people. Zhang also is a grandson of a late top
Chinese leader, whom the people declined to identify, it added.  Zhang didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail and a message
left by  Bloomberg News  on his office phone seeking comment on
the South China Morning Post story.  Michael Vachon , a New York-based spokesman for Soros, declined to comment on the article.  Zhang started Magnolia with Wang Xiao, according to the
SFC. Wang previously worked for Morgan Stanley, Bain Capital LLC
and Coatue Management LLC, the New York-based hedge fund founded
by Philippe Laffont.  To contact the reporter on this story:
