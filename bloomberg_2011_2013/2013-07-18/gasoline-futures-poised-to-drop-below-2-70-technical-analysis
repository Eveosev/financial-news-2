Gasoline for September delivery may
drop below $2.70 a gallon if it doesn’t post consecutive
settlements above July 16’s intraday high, according to a
technical analysis by T&K Futures & Options Inc.  If the contract doesn’t settle above $3.0682 in two
consecutive sessions, it may slip to $2.6621, the intraday low
on June 26, when gasoline began a surge that saw it rise more
than 15 percent in less than a month.  “I would need two consecutive closes above the intraday
high before I get bullish,” Michael Smith, president of T&K in
Port Saint Lucie,  Florida , said in an interview yesterday. “If
it doesn’t have two closes in a row, I think it could pull back
all the way to where it started from.”  The September contract fell 1.49 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
settle at $3.0381 a gallon yesterday on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange.  “As fast as it went up, it could come down twice as
quickly,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
