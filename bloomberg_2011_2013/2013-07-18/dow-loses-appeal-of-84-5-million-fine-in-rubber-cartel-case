Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  failed to overturn
a 64.57 million-euro ($84.5 million) antitrust fine in a rubber
cartel after a European Union court rejected arguments that it
shouldn’t be liable for the actions of subsidiaries more than 10
years ago.  The EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg today rejected the
appeal in a ruling today.  The commission, the 27-naton EU’s antitrust regulator in
November 2006 fined five companies 519 million euros for rigging
prices of synthetic rubber in a cartel that lasted from at least
1996 to 2002.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  escaped a fine after it tipped off the EU
about the cartel.  Dow said in a statement that it didn’t participate in any
of the wrongful conduct and that it was disappointed with the
ruling.  The case is: C-499/11 P, Dow Chemical and Others v.
