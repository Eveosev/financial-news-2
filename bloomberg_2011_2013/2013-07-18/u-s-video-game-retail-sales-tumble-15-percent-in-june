U.S. retail sales of video-game
hardware, software and accessories fell 15 percent to $593.3
million last month as consumers moved to titles played on mobile
devices and held out for next-generation consoles.  Hardware sales fell 30 percent to $142 million from a year
earlier,  Port Washington , New York-based NPD Group Inc. said in
an e-mail yesterday. Software sales for current-generation
consoles declined 10 percent to $296.1 million.  The games and console market is in a two-year slump as
consumers increasingly play Web-delivered titles on smartphones
and tablets, while hard-core gamers look to the first new
machines from  Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  in seven years.
Total spending on U.S. video-game hardware and software,
including used games, rental and digitally delivered content,
was $1.2 billion in June, with physical sales accounting for
about 50 percent of that, NPD said.  Microsoft, in an earlier statement, said U.S. retailers
sold 140,000 of its  Xbox 360  units in June, helping it retain
the top-selling spot for home game consoles for the 30th
straight month. Sales of all Xbox products, including the
console, Kinect motion-sensing peripheral and software, totaled
$197 million, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said, citing
NPD. Sales of the console are down 46 percent from a year
earlier.  Handheld Consoles  Nintendo Co. (7974)  sold 225,000 of its 3DS handheld consoles, the
Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a separate statement. It’s
the second consecutive month the company has edged out the Xbox
360 as the top selling hardware platform.  Shares of Nintendo rose 3.5 percent to close at 13,510 yen
in  Tokyo . Sony fell 0.3 percent to 2,188 yen.  Both Sony’s PlayStation 4, priced at $399, and the Xbox
One, priced at $499, will go on sale later this year. Nintendo’s
Wii U, released last November, sells for about $300 in the U.S.
and has missed sales targets.  They will also compete with Ouya Inc., the startup maker of
a $99 console that said it will spend $1 million to fund
development of games made exclusively for the device. Ouya uses
Google Inc.’s Android operating system. The device’s first month
of sales were “relatively light for a new console,” said Liam
Callahan, an analyst at NPD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
