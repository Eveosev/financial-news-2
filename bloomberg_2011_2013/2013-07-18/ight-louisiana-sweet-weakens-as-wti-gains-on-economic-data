Light Louisiana Sweet weakened
against West Texas Intermediate on the spot market after the
U.S. benchmark rose to the highest level in almost 16 months.  WTI for August delivery rose $1.56 to settle at $108.04 a
barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest level
since March 19, 2012. Prices climbed after the Labor Department
said jobless claims dropped last week.  WTI narrowed its discount to Brent to 89 cents, based on
September contracts, the smallest spread since Oct. 18, 2010.
LLS, the light, sweet benchmark on the Gulf Coast, competes with
foreign oils priced against Brent for space in some U.S.
refineries.  LLS weakened by 80 cents to a premium of $5.75 a barrel to
WTI at 2:02 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet also slipped by 80 cents, to a $4.75-a-barrel
premium.  Mars Blend, a medium, sour crude from the Gulf,
strengthened by 65 cents to 50 cents a barrel more than WTI.
Poseidon crude strengthened 15 cents to a discount of 75 cents.  Crude from the Southern Green Canyon in the Gulf
strengthened by 40 cents to a 60-cent discount. Thunder Horse
crudeâ€™s premium increased 50 cents to $5.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
