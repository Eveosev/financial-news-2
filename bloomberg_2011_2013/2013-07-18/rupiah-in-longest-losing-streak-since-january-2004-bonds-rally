Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a 10th
day, the longest losing streak since January 2004, after the
central bank said it allowed the currency to weaken.  The rupiah touched the lowest level since September 2009
today and has lost 0.9 percent since July 11, the day before
 Bank Indonesia  Deputy Governor Perry Warjiyo said the
monetary authority has supplied dollars to the market over the
past two to three months and allowed the currency to gradually
decline, especially this month. Citigroup Inc. raised its 2014
current-account deficit forecast for Indonesia as the outlook
for commodity prices dims and the Chinese economy slows,
according to a research note yesterday.  “Bank Indonesia has done its job well in maintaining
currency stability, while letting it gradually weaken,” said
Mika Martumpal, head of treasury research and strategy at PT
Bank CIMB Niaga in Jakarta. “Weaker regional growth will
continue to pressure the external balance and subsequently the
rupiah.”  The rupiah dropped 0.2 percent to 10,063 per dollar as of
10:15 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks show. The
currency has declined 5.8 percent in the past 12 months. One-month non-deliverable forwards were steady at 10,420, trading at
a 3.4 percent discount to the spot rate.  The rupiah at 10,000 per dollar is not a cause for concern
as it is in line with economic fundamentals, Bank Indonesia
Governor Agus Martowardojo said yesterday.  Bonds Rally  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 74 basis
points to 13.29 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Indonesia’s current-account shortfall will be 2.2 percent
of gross domestic product in 2014, according to Citigroup
Jakarta-based economist  Helmi Arman , compared with the lender’s
previous estimate of 1.8 percent. The deficit was 2.8 percent
last year and 3 percent in the first quarter of 2013, official
data show.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent bonds due May
2023 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.16
percent, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
