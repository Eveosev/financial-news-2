Indian (SENSEX)  stock climbed for a second
day amid buying in consumer and energy shares.  The S&P BSE Sensex added 0.4 percent to 20,018.49 at 9:47
a.m. in Mumbai. The measure’s  50-day volatility  index rose to
the highest level since April 9, 2012.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) 
and cigarette maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  extended gains to records.  Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , the nation’s biggest explorer, advanced for a
third day, the longest winning streak since May 29.  Some investors may be switching to consumer stocks from
industries like banking and financial services, which are more
likely to be affected by slowing economic growth, according to
Suniil Pachisia, vice president at Pratibhuti Viniyog Ltd. The
S&P BSE FMCG Index headed to an all-time high even as the S&P
BSE Bankex, a gauge of 13 lenders, was bound for a 10-month low.  Hindustan Unilever increased 2.1 percent to 699.65 rupees,
extending yesterday’s 9.9 percent jump. ITC rose 0.1 percent to
368.6 rupees, its fourth day of gains. The two stocks together
have a 16 percent  weighting  in the Sensex. Oil & Natural Gas
jumped 2.7 percent to 309.01 rupees.  The Sensex has gained 3 percent this year and  trades  at
13.5 times projected 12-month earnings, the most expensive since
May 30. The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index is valued at 10 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
