Citigroup Inc. (C) , the bank that took
the most U.S. aid during the credit crisis, is planning to sell
three-year, dollar-denominated notes in a benchmark issue.  The lender may offer fixed- or floating-rate debt, or a
portion of each, as soon as today, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction. The New York-based bank’s bonds
may be rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service.  Citigroup’s $1.35 billion of 1.75 percent debentures due
May 2018 traded yesterday at 96.48 cents on the dollar to yield
2.54 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
