A  Boeing Co. (BA)  787 Dreamliner flown by
Japan Airline Co. aborted a trip to Tokyo yesterday and returned
to  Boston  because a message light indicated a possible fuel-pump
issue, the airline said.  Flight 7 landed as a “precautionary” measure at Logan
International Airport where Japan Airlines’ mechanics are
examining it for any possible damage, Carol Anderson, a
spokeswoman for the carrier, said in a telephone interview. She
added that 184 passengers and 12 crew members were on board.  The pilots didn’t declare an emergency and the plane landed
safely after dumping fuel, Lynn Lunsford, a spokesman for the
U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration , said in an e-mail.  The incident came hours after investigators focused on a
beacon made by  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  as being linked to
the July 12 Dreamliner fire at London’s Heathrow airport. That
eased investor concern that the U.K. probe would raise new
questions about the electrical system whose battery meltdowns
spurred a global 787 grounding this year.  Boeing rallied 2.7 percent at the  New York  close on news of
the U.K. inquiry’s preliminary report, then fell 1.3 percent to
$106.25 at 7:59 p.m. in extended trading as word spread of
Flight 7’s diversion.  The flight departed Logan at 1:19 p.m. local time and was
scheduled to last more than 13 hours before the twin-engine 787
returned at 6:16 p.m., according to industry data tracker
