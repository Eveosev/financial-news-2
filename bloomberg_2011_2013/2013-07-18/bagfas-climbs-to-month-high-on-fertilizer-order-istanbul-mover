Bagfas Bandirma Gubre Fabrikalari
AS (BAGFS) , a Turkish fertilizer maker, climbed to the highest level in
a month as investors bet an order from a larger local competitor
will help boost earnings during the low season.  The shares rose 3.6 percent to 43.6 liras at the close in
Istanbul, advancing for a second day to the highest level since
June 20. More than 163,000 shares changed hands, or 2.6 times
the three-month daily average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The benchmark  Borsa Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index fell
less than 0.1 percent to 77,022.76 points, paring its weekly
gain to 4.2 percent.  Istanbul-based Bagfas received a $18.3 million chemical
fertilizer order from  Gubre Fabrikalari TAS (GUBRF) , according to a
statement to the bourse today. Gubre is  Turkey ’s largest
specialty chemicals maker by sales, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Deliveries of the 50,000 metric-ton order will
begin this month and will continue to September, the company
said.  “The order amounts to 12 percent of last year’s sales,”
Umut Ozturk, an analyst at Burgan Securities in Istanbul, said
by phone. “It’s a good surprise for the summer season.”
Fertilizer sales are not very active in the summer and generally
pick up pace in the first and fourth quarters, Ozturk said.  Bagfas reported  net income  of 1.94 million liras ($1
million) in the first quarter, down 85 percent from the same
period last year. Two analysts  recommend  buying the stock, while
Ozturk is one of four that say hold, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg.  The shares trade at 13.1 times estimated 12-month earnings,
 data  compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with 6.1 for
Istanbul-based Gubre, 9.5 for Tel Aviv-based  Israel Chemicals
Ltd. (ICL)  and 12.3 for Jubail-based  Saudi Arabian Fertilizer Co. (SAFCO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
