Forte Oil Plc (FO)  of Nigeria, which
operates gasoline stations in  Africa ’s second-biggest economy,
jumped to the highest in almost 2 1/2 years after the government
paid money claimed by companies for fuel subsidies.  The stock advanced by the maximum daily limit of 10 percent
to 27.06 naira at the close in Lagos, the commercial capital.
Almost 670,000 shares traded, equal to more than 1.3 times the
three-month daily average.  Forte was among 25 oil marketing companies that received 48
billion naira ($298 million) this week, ThisDay newspaper
 reported , citing a statement from the Finance Ministry dated
yesterday. Total payments made this year stand at 240.5 billion
naira, according to the newspaper.  “With the payment by the government, the company will be
able to pay off some loans and reduce its interest expense,”
Dolapo Oni, a Lagos-based energy research analyst at Ecobank
Transnational Inc., said in an e-mailed response to questions.  Nigeria, Africa’s biggest crude producer, subsidizes the
cost of gasoline on the local market. An attempt by President
Goodluck Jonathan to scrap the rebates in January 2012 without
notice sparked strikes and protests. In March, Jonathan said he
still intends to withdraw the grants.  Forte’s shares have more than tripled this year and are the
second-best performer on the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
 Index (NGSEINDX) , which rallied 37 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
