France ’s government bonds rose as
the nation’s borrowing costs fell at an auction of five-year
notes, the first sale since  Fitch Ratings  stripped Europe’s
second-largest economy of its AAA rating last week.  France’s 10- and  five-year yields  dropped to the lowest
level in a month even as the nation sold 7.99 billion euros
($10.5 billion) of notes, including 4.12 billion euros of
securities maturing in November 2018. It also sold 1.2 billion
euros of inflation-linked debt.  French 10-year (GFRN10)  yields have
fallen since Fitch cut the credit score by one step to AA+ on
July 12, joining Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s
in removing the nation from the club of top-rated governments.  “The auction was positive” in terms of total amount sold
and demand, said  Richard McGuire , a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in  London . “That’s indicative of the
idea that ratings downgrades have long since lost their power to
shock. There was no impact on these auctions.”  French  10-year yields  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.17 percent at 2:54 p.m. London time after
touching 2.16 percent, the lowest since June 19. The 1.75
percent security, maturing in May 2023, rose 0.28, or 2.80 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 96.33. The rate was 2.19 percent
on July 12, before the Fitch announcement.  Five-year note yields slid five basis points to 1.09
percent and reached 1.08 percent, also the lowest since June 19.  While Fitch cited lack of growth as a reason for the cut,
investors have largely shrugged off ratings changes in recent
months. France’s government bonds gained 9.3 percent since
 Standard & Poor’s  lowered the nation’s rating to AA+ from AAA in
January 2012, and returned 0.4 percent since the Moody’s
downgrade in November, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch France Government Index.  Yields on sovereign securities last year moved in the
opposite direction from what ratings suggested in 53 percent of
32 upgrades, downgrades and changes in credit outlook, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg published in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
