Nucor Corp. (NUE) , the largest U.S.
steelmaker by market value, reported second-quarter earnings
that missed analysts’ estimates after the price of the metal on
lower domestic demand.  Net income fell to $85.1 million, or 27 cents, a share,
from $112.3 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier, the  Charlotte ,
North Carolina-based company said today in a statement. That
trailed the $93.7 million average of five estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Sales dropped to $4.67 billion from $5.1 billion, exceeding
the $4.59 billion average of 11 estimates.  Apparent U.S. domestic steel consumption in the first five
months of 2013 declined 7.7 percent, according to the latest
data compiled by Bloomberg. Usage has dropped at a faster rate
than U.S. production, causing prices to fall, said Andrew Cosgrove, an analyst at Bloomberg Industries in Princeton,  New
Jersey .  The average price of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark steel
product used in cars and trucks, was $593 a short ton in the
quarter, 10 percent lower than a year earlier, according to  data 
from The Steel Index.  Nucor rose 1.2 percent to $45.29 in  New York  yesterday. The
shares have climbed 4.9 percent this year.  (Nucor scheduled a conference call at 2 p.m. New York time,
which can be accessed at the company’s website
