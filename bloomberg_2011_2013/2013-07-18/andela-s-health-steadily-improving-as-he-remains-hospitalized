The health of South Africa’s former
president,  Nelson Mandela , who celebrates his 95th birthday
today, is “steadily improving” as he remains in the hospital,
President  Jacob Zuma ’s office said.  “We thank all our people for supporting Madiba throughout
the hospitalization with undying love and compassion,” the
presidency said in a statement today. “We also thank all for
responding to the call to give Madiba the biggest birthday
celebration ever this year.” Madiba is Mandela’s clan name.  The former leader has been in a Pretoria hospital since
June 8 to receive treatment for a recurring lung infection.
Doctors downgraded his condition to critical on June 23. His
granddaughter, Zaziwe Manaway, yesterday said Mandela is “doing
much better,” while his condition is still classified as
“critical but stable.”  Mandela took office as head of Africa’s largest economy
after the  African National Congress  won the country’s first
multiracial elections in 1994. He had spent 27 years in jail for
opposing white-minority rule and won the Nobel Peace Prize in
1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
