The European Commission was informed
yesterday by  Monsanto Co. (MON)  that it plans to withdraw its
applications for approval of genetically modified crops in the
bloc, according to commission spokesman  Frederic Vincent .  Monsanto had the majority of applications pending with the
commission, Vincent said by phone today from Brussels.  Monsanto will keep its bid to renew MON810 corn, which was
previouly approved in the European Union, said Mark Buckingham,
a company spokesman in Cambourne, England. “It’s clear there
isn’t a path to market and commercialize GM products for
cultivation in Europe,” he said. “We need to focus our limited
resources where we can get the best return. In Europe, there are
significant opportunities in conventional breeding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
