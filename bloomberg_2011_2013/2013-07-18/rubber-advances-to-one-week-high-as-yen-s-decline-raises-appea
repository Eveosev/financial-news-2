Rubber climbed to the highest level
in more than a week as  Japan ’s currency declined against the
dollar, raising the appeal of yen-denominated contracts.  Rubber for delivery in December on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange gained as much as 1.3 percent to 247.9 yen a kilogram
($2,484 a metric ton), the highest level since July 5. The most-active contract traded at 246.1 yen at 11:12 a.m., paring losses
for this year to 19 percent.  The yen declined to 99.87 per dollar amid speculation Group
of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meeting this week
will endorse the Bank of Japan’s monetary easing. Russian Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said the G-20 probably won’t
call for a tapering of stimulus in nations including Japan.  “Futures drew support from the currency market,” said
Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in
Tokyo. “The yen may decline further depending on the result of
the G-20 meeting.”  The BOJ doubled monthly bond purchases to more than 7
trillion yen in April, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged the
central bank to take steps to overcome deflation. Opinion polls
have shown Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party and coalition partners
are likely to win a majority in the upper house election this
weekend, ending a hung parliament.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.1 percent to 18,235  yuan  ($2,970) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board remained unchanged at 78.85 baht ($2.54) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
