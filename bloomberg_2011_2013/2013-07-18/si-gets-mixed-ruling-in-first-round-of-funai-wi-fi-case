LSI Corp. (LSI)  got a mixed ruling in the
first round of its patent-infringement case against  Realtek
Semiconductor Corp. (2379)  and Funai Electric Co. over Wi-Fi technology
used in televisions and DVD players sold under Sylvania,
Magnavox and other brands.  Funai infringed one LSI patent and not three others, and
Realtek didn’t infringe two patents, U.S. International Trade
Commission Judge David Shaw said in a  notice  posted today on the
Washington agency’s website. The judge’s findings are subject to
review by the full six-member commission, which can block
imports of products that infringe U.S. patents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
