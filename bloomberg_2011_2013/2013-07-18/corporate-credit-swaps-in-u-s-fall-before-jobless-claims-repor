A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk decreased for the second day before a report on weekly
jobless claims.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1
basis point to a mid-price of 75.2 basis points at 8:02 a.m. in
New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Investors are looking to employment figures and other
economic data to determine when the Federal Reserve may pare its
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases. A Labor Department report
set for release at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  may show initial
jobless claims fell to 345,000 for the week ended July 13, down
from 360,000 the prior week, according to the median estimate of
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
