Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , Ohio’s largest
lender, said second-quarter profit rose 58 percent as lending
and fee income grew and the bank posted a gain from selling a
stake in  Vantiv Inc. (VNTV)   Net income climbed to $594 million, or 66 cents a share,
from $376 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier, the Cincinnati-based bank said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 42 cents a share.  “Nearly all fee income categories increased quarter-over-quarter, highlighted by mortgage banking net revenue and
corporate banking,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Kabat, 56,
said in the statement. “Credit trends continued to improve.”  The bank incurred a gain of $242 million on the sale of its
shares in Vantiv, a payment processor, and a $76 million benefit
from the valuation of a Vantiv warrant. Fifth Third raised its
 quarterly dividend  last month 9 percent to 12 cents a share. The
bank’s stock has gained 25 percent this year, compared with the
26 percent  advance  of the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
