Philip Morris International Inc., (PM) 
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, reported
second-quarter earnings that trailed analysts’ estimates after
the stronger dollar reduced overseas  sales .  Net income  sank 8.3 percent to $2.12 billion, or $1.30 a
share, from $2.32 billion, or $1.36, a year earlier, the New
York-based maker of Marlboro cigarettes said today in a
statement. Analysts projected earnings of $1.41, the average of
13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Philip Morris  generates all of its  revenue  outside of the
U.S., reducing the value of earnings after the yen and other
currencies weakened in the second quarter. Unfavorable currency
shifts reduced second-quarter profit by 7 cents a share while
lower cigarette shipments also hurt earnings.  “The weak start to the year leaves a lot to do in the
second half of the year to hit full year guidance,” Charlie Mills, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG in  London , wrote
today in a note. He rates Philip Morris shares neutral,
equivalent to a hold recommendation.  Profit trailed analysts’ average estimate by 7.5 percent,
the biggest miss since  Altria Group Inc. (MO)  spun off Philip Morris
in March 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Philip Morris projected currencies will lower profit by 31
cents in 2013, more than its earlier projection for a 19-cent
reduction. The company now expects to earn $5.43 to $5.53 a
share, down from a projection of $5.55 to $5.65 in April.  Falling Demand  Cigarette shipments dropped 3.9 percent, hurt by falling
demand in markets including the European Union,  Russia  and the
 Philippines .  Sales increased 2.2 percent to $20.5 billion. Excluding
excise taxes, revenue slipped 2.5 percent to $7.9 billion. It
would have risen 0.5 percent if not for unfavorable currency,
the company said.  Twelve of 16 major currencies fell against the dollar in
the second quarter, led by the Australian dollar’s decline of 12
percent. The yen slipped 5 percent, while the euro advanced 1.5
percent.  Philip Morris fell 1.8 percent to $88.13 at 9:39 a.m. in
 New York . The shares had risen 7.3 percent this year through
yesterday compared with an 18 percent  gain  for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
