Coller Capital Ltd., the British
buyer of private-equity assets started by Jeremy Coller, is in
talks to acquire  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s stake in  DLJ Merchant
Banking Partners , three people with knowledge of the talks said.  Coller is close to an agreement to acquire the bank’s stake
in New York-based DLJ’s funds, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the talks are private. DLJ’s managers, led
by Nicole Arnaboldi, will start their own firm to manage those
assets on behalf of Coller, one of the people said.  Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank, is exiting
more illiquid businesses as regulations such as the Volcker rule
seek to limit risk-taking by financial companies. The Zurich-based bank sold CS Strategic Partners, another private equity
division, to New York-based  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  in April.  Credit Suisse inherited DLJ Merchant Banking Partners
through its acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000.
The unit raised $2.1 billion for its most recent fund, DLJ
Merchant Banking Partners IV, in 2006. DLJ’s investments include
U.S. waste-management group Deffenbaugh Industries Inc. and U.K.
travel agent Education & Adventure Travel Group.  Shona Prendergast, a spokeswoman for Coller Capital in
London, and  Katherine Herring , a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse
in New York, both declined to comment on the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
