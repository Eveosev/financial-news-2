Urmia, the  Middle East ’s largest
lake, is in danger of drying up as  Iran ’s Energy Ministry and
local officials failed to ensure critical water transfers,  Aftab
News  said, citing a lawmaker.  The energy ministry is not standing by its commitment
regarding Urmia Lake, Nader Ghazipour, who represents the city
of the same name in the Iranian parliament, was quoted as saying
on Aftab’s website. No funds have been allocated for the lake
and “efforts to remedy its critical condition are leading
nowhere,” he said.  Urmia in northwestern Iran, one of the largest hyper-saline
lakes in the world, is a UNESCO biosphere reserve, according to
a United Nations  report . The lake’s surface area has declined
since the mid-1990s due to drought, increased water diversion
for agriculture and mismanagement, it said.  Urmia Lake is now only a third full of water, Ghazipour
said. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tabriz and
Urmia in 2011, criticizing authorities for minimal actions to
save the lake, the UN said. A plan to transfer water from nearby
Aras River wasn’t followed through on, Ghazipour said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
