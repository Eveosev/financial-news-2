West African Gas Pipeline Co. , which
supplies natural gas from  Nigeria , resumed deliveries from a
pipeline July 12.  “The West African gas pipeline has now been repaired, re-commissioned and back in operation,” Harriet Wereko-Brobby, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement today from
Accra, Ghana. Force majeure, a legal clause allowing it to miss
shipments, was lifted July 11, she said.  The company, known as WAPCo, delivers gas to buyers in
Benin, Togo and Ghana. WAPCo on Aug. 28 shut down the link and
declared a force majeure after a ship’s anchor damaged it in
Togolese waters.  “The company is pursuing measures to forestall a re-occurrence of the pipeline breach incident,” Wereko-Brobby
said.  WAPCo is a venture between  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp.,  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Takoradi Power Co.,
Societe Togolaise de Gaz and Societe BenGaz SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
