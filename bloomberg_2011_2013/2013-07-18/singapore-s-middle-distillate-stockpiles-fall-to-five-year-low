Middle-distillate stockpiles fell 15
percent to the lowest level in more than five years in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene slid by 1.27 million barrels to 7 million in the seven
days ended yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in
an e-mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since the week
through May 7, 2008.  Stockpiles of  residual fuels , including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined by 881,000
barrels, or 4.5 percent, to 18.9 million, the data show.
Supplies dropped for a fourth week to the least since the period
to May 1.  Light-distillate inventories including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate were down 502,000 barrels, or 5.9 percent, to 8
million, according to the data. Supplies decreased for a second
week to the lowest since the week to Feb. 11, 2009.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
