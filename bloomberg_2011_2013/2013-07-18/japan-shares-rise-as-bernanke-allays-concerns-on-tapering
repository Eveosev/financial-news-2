Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index climbing for a fourth day, as the yen weakened and Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  eased concerns the U.S. is on a
preset course to taper stimulus.  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., a maker of cars and heavy
machinery that gets about 65 percent of sales overseas, climbed
2.1 percent.  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , the mobile carrier that became the
third-biggest Topix company by market value yesterday, gained 4
percent after announcing a fuel-cell joint venture.  Toshiba
Corp. (6502)  climbed 2.3 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the
chipmaker plans to expand capacity.  KLab Inc. (3656)  surged 24 percent
after the software developer said it plans to form a mobile-game
tie-up with Japan’s No. 2 advertising company.  The Topix added 0.7 percent to 1,222.01 at the close in
 Tokyo , with 26 of the 33 industry groups advancing. Volume was
14 percent below the 30-day average. The Nikkei 225 Stock
Average rose 1.3 percent to 14,808.50.  “Some investors view the Bernanke speech as a positive
signal they will continue easing for the foreseeable future,”
said  Akio Yoshino , chief economist in Tokyo at Amundi Japan
Ltd., which oversees the equivalent of $27 billion. “Still, the
response is mixed. There are still many ‘ifs.’”  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix has rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will push through economic reforms following elections on July
21. The gauge added 14 percent in the past four weeks, the
biggest such advance since April 2009.  Bernanke Comments  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today. The measure
added 0.3 percent in  New York  yesterday after Bernanke’s
testimony to Congress. The Fed’s asset purchases “are by no
means on a preset course” and could even be expanded should
economic conditions warrant, he said in his policy address.  Central-bank officials have been debating the timing of
cuts in $85 billion of monthly bond purchases. Bernanke has said
any reduction will be tied to improvement in the labor market or
an acceleration of inflation. The  U.S. economy  maintained a
“modest to moderate pace” of growth in recent weeks, the Fed
said in its Beige Book business survey.  Japan’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to 100.18 per dollar
today, after falling 0.5 percent yesterday. The yen is the
worst-performing major currency since mid-November. A weaker yen
boosts the value of Japanese exporters’ earnings when
repatriated.  “The yen didn’t climb strongly, and U.S. stocks didn’t
slide, which is ideal for the Japanese stock market,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , chief  fund manager  at Ichiyoshi Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. Still, “Japanese shares have risen
quite high and we need more catalysts to rise further. The yen
needs to weaken to about 105 per dollar.”  Technical Indicators  The Topix’s Relative Strength Index, which tracks the
velocity of price changes, was at 67.21 today, near the 70
threshold some traders see as a sign that stocks may be poised
to fall. The 25-day Toraku Index, which compares the numbers
advancing and declining stocks on the gauge, reached 132.57
yesterday, above the 130 level some investors say signals stocks
may decline.  SoftBank gained 4 percent to 6,450 yen after the company
controlled by billionaire Masayoshi Son announced plans to enter
the fuel-cell business in Japan in partnership with California
startup Bloom Energy Corp. Using fuel-cell units reduces the
risk of blackouts, such as those that occurred in Japan after
the March 2011 Fukushima accident, since they’re not dependent
on centralized  power plants .  Toshiba rose 2.3 percent to 493 yen, its highest level in
seven weeks, as the Nikkei reported the chipmaker plans to
invest 30 billion yen to add equipment for  flash memory  at its
plant in Mie prefecture, western Japan, reflecting increased
demand for smartphones. Production is expected to start in
fiscal 2014, the newspaper said.  KLab Surges  KLab jumped 24 percent to 1547 yen for its second-largest
gain on record. The  software developer  is planning to form a
mobile-game alliance with Hakuhodo Inc. The Tokyo-based firm
will also sell shares to the advertising company.  The Topix traded at 1.3 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.48 for the S&P 500 and 1.67 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day historic volatility was at
29.82 today, down 31 percent from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
