Eight Afghan laborers working with
the U.S. military were taken from their vehicle and executed by
Taliban gunmen with a shot to the head in the eastern province
of Logar, a local official said.  The civilian workers, aged between 18 and 20, were on their
way to work at Camp Shank, a U.S. facility near the provincial
capital of Pul-i-Alam, Din Mohammad Darwish, a spokesman for the
provincial government, said by phone. “The civilians’ vehicle
was first stopped by Taliban and all of them were taken to a
nearby hill where they were shot in the head, one by one,”
Darwish said.  A spokesman for NATO’s  International Security Assistance
Force  in Kabul, Master Sgt. Bryan Gatewood, confirmed that the
eight people killed were working at the U.S. base.  The attack underscores the dangers facing local Afghans who
work alongside international forces in the country amid a
drawdown of frontline foreign troops, said Jawed Kohistani, a
Kabul-based security and political analyst.  To contact the reporter on this story:
