Woolworths Ltd. (WOW) ,  Australia ’s largest
retailer, expects to lose A$157 million ($145 million) in the
year ended June for its Masters home-improvement joint venture
with Lowe’s Cos. The shares fell.  Sales from the 31 Masters stores came to A$529 million,
Sydney-based Woolworths said in a regulatory statement today.
The hardware division as a whole, which includes the Danks trade
merchant business, lost A$139 million before interest and tax
compared to a forecast of an A$81 million loss.  Weak  consumer confidence  and high start-up costs had
weighed on performance in Masters, which along with Danks is 33
percent owned by Lowe’s according to Woolworths’ last annual
report. Sales budgets were too optimistic, wage costs were too
high in new stores, and the profit margin between wholesale and
retail prices was too low, according to the company.  “The company looks to be facing a period of lower growth
in the foreseeable future, and the earnings drag from its entry
into hardware is inopportune timing,” David Errington, an
analyst at Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch division, wrote
in a note to clients April 26. “The drag from hardware looks
likely to us to soon become substantial.” The division would
lose A$135 million before interest and tax this year, Errington
forecast at the time.  Woolworths shares fell 1.5 percent to A$33.18 at 10:20 a.m.
in Sydney, compared to a 0.4 percent rise in the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index.  Woolworths also revised its forecast for net income in
today’s release, to a tighter range of 5 percent to 6 percent
growth from 4 percent to 6 percent  To contact the reporter on this story:
