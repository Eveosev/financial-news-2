U.K. stocks  rose to the highest
level in seven weeks, led by  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and
 WPP Plc (WPP) , as a report showed U.S. jobless-benefit claims fell to
a two-month low.  LSE rallied to a five-year high after saying first-quarter
revenue rose 39 percent. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising
company, climbed 3.6 percent after French peer Publicis Groupe
SA reported first-half sales that exceeded estimates.  Tate &
Lyle Plc (TATE)  fell 0.9 percent after Societe Generale SA lowered its
rating on the shares.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 62.43 points, or 1 percent, to
6,634.36 at the close in London, the highest level since May 30.
The gauge has still lost 3 percent since May 22 after the
 Federal Reserve  signaled it may start to taper stimulus measures
if the  U.S. economy  improves in line with its forecasts. The
FTSE All-Share Index rose 0.9 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index jumped 1.7 percent.  “What counts today is the earnings,” said Pierre Mouton,
who helps oversee $6 billion as a portfolio manager at Notz,
Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “I would look in detail at what
companies say about their businesses. We will probably see
positive earnings in most cases, though I also think companies
will deliver a slightly cautious message for the end of the
year. The U.K. economy is also starting to recover slowly and
that is a positive for stocks.”  The volume of shares in FTSE 100 companies changing hands
today was 6.1 percent less than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  U.S. Economy  In the U.S.,  jobless claims  dropped by 24,000 to 334,000 in
the week ended July 13, the fewest since early May, a Labor
Department report showed. Economists on average had forecast a
reading of 345,000. A separate release showed manufacturing in
the Philadelphia region expanded more than forecast in July.  LSE climbed 7.4 percent to 1,590 pence, the highest price
since February 2008. The operator of Europe’s oldest independent
bourse said first-quarter revenue rose 39 percent to 249.7
million pounds ($380 million) as all of its business divisions
grew and LCH contributed to the performance. The so-called
organic revenue increased 8 percent on constant-currency basis.  Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in
London, wrote in a note that LSE’s sales matched the upper end
of consensus estimates.  WPP rose 3.6 percent to 1,210 pence. Publicis, the third-biggest advertising company, reported first-half revenue of 3.35
billion euros, surpassing the 3.31 billion-euro average analyst
estimate.  Discount Airlines  EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  advanced 4.2 percent to 1,406 pence, its
highest price since it sold shares to the public in November
2000.  Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  gained 2.9 percent to 7.28 euros in
Dublin. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its recommendations on
Europe’s two biggest discount airlines to overweight, the
equivalent of buy, from underweight.  “Our multi-year vision of Europe envisions little
restructuring actually standing in the way of voracious growth
appetites at higher caliber discounters,” the brokerage wrote
in a report.  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS) , Britain’s largest clothing
retailer, advanced 1.9 percent to 482.4 pence as U.K. retail
sales rose for a second month in June.  Sales including fuel 
climbed 0.2 percent from May, when they surged 2.1 percent, the
Office for National Statistics said.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY) , the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket
chain, increased 3 percent to 391.1 pence.  Sports Direct International Plc (SPD)  jumped 6.2 percent to 638
pence, the highest price since the company first sold shares in
2007. The sporting-goods retailer posted full-year underlying
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
of 287.9 million pounds, beating the 268 million-pound average
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Tate & Lyle declined 0.9 percent to 851.5 pence after
 Societe Generale  downgraded the maker of low-calorie sweetener
Splenda to hold from buy, citing the likelihood of weaker
earnings from its bulk-ingredient business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
