New York  utility regulators approved
expanding a state solar incentive program to accommodate larger
homes and businesses and meet Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s goal of
quadrupling installations this year compared with 2011.  Owners of residential solar systems with as much as 25
kilowatts of capacity will qualify for a share of the state’s
$150 million in annual incentives, up from the earlier limit of
7 kilowatts. The limit for commercial projects was increased to
200 kilowatts.  “The changes we made today will ensure that the growth of
solar installations, which spurs the creation of jobs in New
York, continues well into the future,” New York Public Service
Commission Chairman Garry Brown said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
