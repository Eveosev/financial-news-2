Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  rose to the
highest since at least 1980 after the railroad’s second-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates as crude oil shipments increased
and coal volumes showed signs of stabilizing.  The shares  gained  1.1 percent to $161.36 in New York, the
highest closing price in data compiled by Bloomberg that begins
in July 1980. They have advanced 28 percent this year,  compared 
with an 18 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “There was no bad news in the quarter,”  Jason Seidl , a
Cowen & Co. analyst in New York who rates  the stock  outperform,
said in an interview. “The outlook is solid, with the back half
of the year looking better than the first half. You’ll see the
growth rate in earnings pick up in the third and fourth
quarter.”  The results at the largest U.S. railroad fulfill Chief
Executive Officer Jack Koraleski’s prediction that coal, the
biggest cargo for Omaha, Nebraska-based Union Pacific, would
rebound as utilities returned to the fuel amid climbing U.S.
temperatures and natural  gas prices . Revenue from hauling coal
increased 12 percent to $975 million on volume that was little
changed, the company said. Shipments of automobiles and
industrial products also advanced.  Net income rose 10 percent to $1.11 billion, or $2.37 a
share, from $1 billion, or $2.10, a year earlier, the railroad
said today in a statement. That beat the $2.35  average  of
28 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 4.8 percent to $5.47 billion, trailing the
$5.5 billion average estimate of analysts. Total volume fell
less than 1 percent to 2.25 million carloads, while average
revenue per car climbed 5.5 percent, Union Pacific said.  Record Ratio  Operating ratio, an industry gauge of expenses to revenue,
fell to 65.7 percent, a record low, from 67 percent a year
earlier, according to the statement.  Accelerating U.S. economic growth in the second half will
help buoy Union Pacific’s results, Koraleski said in an
interview today.  “The second quarter felt a little more sluggish for us,”
he said. “We’re hopeful some of the sluggishness will go
away.”  Growth in shipments of lumber, an indication of
homebuilding activity, slowed to 11 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, from 18 percent in 2013’s first
three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
