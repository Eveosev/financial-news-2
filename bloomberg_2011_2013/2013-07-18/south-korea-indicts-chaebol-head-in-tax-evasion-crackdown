Seoul prosecutors indicted the head
of CJ Group, a South Korean food and entertainment group, for
 tax evasion  and embezzlement as part of a government drive to
crack down on corporate crime.  Lee Jay Hyun, the 53-year-old chairman of the group, was
charged today after an investigation that started in May,
according to the prosecutors. The group is the country’s 14th-largest chaebol, the conglomerates that dominate South Korea’s
economy.  President Park Geun Hye pledged to crack down on tax
evasion to help fund increased welfare spending and the
country’s tax agency began 23 separate investigations in May.
The government has targeted the heads of chaebol for tax evasion
and embezzlement in previous years, including  Samsung Group  and
 Hyundai Group , the country’s two biggest.  Lee avoided 54.6 billion won ($49 million) in taxes and
misappropriated 96.3 billion won in company assets, the Seoul
Central District Prosecutors’ Office said in a statement today.
Lee had used a CJ Group unit to provide collateral and
guarantees for property purchases in  Japan , according to the
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
