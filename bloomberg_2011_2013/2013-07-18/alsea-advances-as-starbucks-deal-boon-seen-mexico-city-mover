Alsea SAB, the operator of Burger
King and Starbucks restaurants in  Mexico , rose for a fourth day
as Credit Suisse Group AG said acquisitions in  Argentina  and
 Chile  will be positive for the stock.  Alsea climbed 2 percent to 34.98 pesos at 12:13 p.m. in
Mexico City, extending its gain this week to 8.6 percent. The
country’s benchmark IPC was down 0.1 percent today.  The Mexico City-based company said yesterday in a statement
to the stock exchange that it acquired the 18 percent of
Starbucks Argentina and 82 percent of Starbucks Chile that it
didn’t already own. The company also agreed to a plan to open
130 stores in the two countries over the next five years. Alsea
didn’t disclose the prices or valuations for the transactions.
Credit Suisse maintained a  rating  equivalent to buy.  “Strategically, more control and more growth for Alsea is
a positive,” Credit Suisse analyst Antonio Gonzalez wrote today
in a research note to clients. The call assumes that the
transactions are accretive to Alsea’s valuation, as was the case
in a recent deal to bring its stake in Starbucks Mexico to 100
percent, according to the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
