Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
widened a day after a government report showed weaker demand and
higher imports of the biofuel led to the biggest supply gain
since November.  The spread, or price difference, expanded 2.27 cents to
60.68 cents a gallon after the U.S. Energy Information
Administration said  demand  for the additive tumbled the most
since January,  foreign purchases  doubled last week and
 inventories  rose to the highest level in 10 weeks.  “Ethanol blending dropped,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst
at Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis . “Now we’re
able to build ethanol stocks higher for the first time in a
while.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 2.3 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.503 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 14 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery decreased 0.03 cent to $3.1098
a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Inventories climbed 5.5 percent to 16.6 million barrels in
the week ended July 12, according to a report yesterday from the
EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is part of the
country’s plans to reduce dependence on foreign sources of crude
oil. A 2007 energy law requires refiners to use 13.8 billion
gallons, or about 900,000 barrels a day, of the fuel this year
and 14.4 billion in 2014.  Government Mandate  Compliance with the mandate is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached to each
gallon of biofuel and that is submitted to the government. Once
they blend ethanol, companies can trade the RINs.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  dipped 2 cents to $1.41, falling
from a record high. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel and
Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, also fell 2 cents from a
record to $1.42.  Corn for September delivery advanced 2.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $5.41 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 37 cents,
down from 39 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 2.5
cents to $2.675 a gallon; in Chicago the additive gained 1 cent
to $2.60; on the West Coast prices rose 0.5 cent to $2.685; and
in  New York  the biofuel dropped 5 cents to $2.61 a gallon, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago dwindled 6 cents to 1
cent. The  Gulf Coast ’s discount to the West Coast tightened 2
cents to 1 cent.  Imports of the biofuel last week doubled to 50,000 barrels
a day, data from the Energy Department’s research arm show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.19 a gallon in the
week ended July 12, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
