Swiss stocks  were little changed as
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke prepared for a second
day of testimony to U.S. Congress.  SGS SA (SGSN)  declined as analysts including Barclays Plc cut
price targets a day after the company posted a smaller increase
in first-half profit than expected because of restructuring
costs in Europe and a decline in earnings at its minerals
business. Swatch Group AG gained after a trade group said Swiss
watch exports will increase this year.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  rose 0.2 percent to 7,941.01 in
Zurich. The broader Swiss Performance Index gained 0.1 percent
to 7,497.64 today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was 44 percent lower than the 30-day average today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bernanke delivers his second day of semi-annual testimony
to Congress on monetary policy today, facing questions from the
Senate Banking Committee. Yesterday he said that the pace of the
economic recovery will determine when the U.S. central bank
starts reducing its asset purchases.  SGS, the world’s largest product inspector, fell 1.5
percent to 2,106 francs, dropping for a second consecutive day.
Barclays cut its price target to 2,450 francs from 2,500 francs.  Swatch, the world’s biggest watchmaker, rose 0.9 percent to
535.50 francs. The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry today
said growth “is still the order of the day, but on a more
measured basis than in the previous years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
