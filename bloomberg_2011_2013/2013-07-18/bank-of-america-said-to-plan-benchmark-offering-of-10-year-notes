Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-biggest U.S. lender that  reported  net income jumped 63 percent,
plans to sell 10-year benchmark bonds as soon as today.  Proceeds from the offering will be used for general
corporate purposes, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction. The securities may be rated Baa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service. Benchmark sales are typically at least $500
million.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan ’s cost-cutting
efforts helped the bank exceed analysts’ estimates with $4.01
billion in net income in the second quarter, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based lender said yesterday in a statement.  The bank’s $4.25 billion of 3.3 percent notes due in
January 2023 traded at 95 cents on the dollar to yield 3.94
percent yesterday, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
