German stocks  declined for the
second time this week, led by a selloff in  SAP AG (SAP) , after the
company reported its first decline in software sales in more
than three years.  SAP lost 2.8 percent as the largest maker of business-management software also abandoned its revenue forecasts.
 Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  fell for a second day as JPMorgan Chase &
Co. downgraded the airline.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  climbed to the
highest price since March 25 after Vale SA sought to keep its 26
percent stake in the German steelmaker’s plant in Brazil.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  slid 0.2 percent to 8,241.58 at
10:03 a.m. in Frankfurt. The gauge climbed 0.7 percent yesterday
after the Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
bank’s asset purchases are not on a preset course. The broader
HDAX Index retreated 0.1 percent today.  “Earnings downgrades continue,” said Nick Xanders, an
equity strategist at BTIG Ltd. in London. “Today’s earnings
have been less than stellar with SAP lowering its outlook on
Asia. Early weakness in the market may not be met by the same
rebound today as yesterday.”  SAP lost 2.8 percent to 56.03 euros after the company said
software licenses, an indicator of future income, fell about 3
percent to 982 million euros ($1.3 billion) excluding currency
swings. That missed the average analyst estimate of 1.02 billion
euros in a Bloomberg survey and marked the first decrease since
the fourth quarter of 2009.  Lufthansa lost 1.4 percent to 15.12 euros after JPMorgan
lowered its recommendation for  Europe ’s second-largest airline
to neutral from overweight. The earlier recommendation was
similar to a buy rating.  ThyssenKrupp rose 1.8 percent to 16.60 euros, its highest
price since March 25 after Vale Chief Executive Officer Murilo
Ferreira told reporters in Brasilia yesterday that the company
will  its 26 percent stake in ThyssenKrupp’s steel plant in Rio
de Janeiro.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 22 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
