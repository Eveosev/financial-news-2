Schindler Holding AG (SCHP)  lost a European
Union court bid to overturn a 143.7 million-euro ($188.5
million) cartel fine for colluding with competitors on prices
for elevators and escalators.  The  EU Court of Justice , the EUâ€™s highest tribunal, in
Luxembourg rejected the appeal today.  The European Commission  fined  five companies 992.3 million
euros in February 2007 for setting prices in  Belgium , Germany,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands between at least 1995 and 2004.
They rigged contract bids, allocated projects to each other and
shared confidential information, the EU said.  Schindler, based in Ebikon,  Switzerland , said it will
closely analyze the ruling. The company paid the full amount of
the fine in 2007, according to a statement on its website.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  two years ago won an appeal at a lower
court cutting 159.9 million euros off a 479.7 million-euro
antitrust fine in the case.  The case is: C-501/11 P, Schindler Holding Ltd., Schindler
Management AG, Schindler SA, Schindler Sarl, Schindler Liften BV
and Schindler Deutschland Holding GmbH v. European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
