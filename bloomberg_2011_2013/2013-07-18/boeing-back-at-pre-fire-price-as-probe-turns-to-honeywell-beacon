Boeing Co. (BA)  shares recovered to the
price before last week’s fire on board a 787 Dreamliner in
London after  U.K. regulators said a beacon made by Honeywell
International Inc. should be deactivated on all other planes.  The comments eased investors’ renewed concerns about the
innovative architecture of the 787, which relies on electricity
to power almost every function. The Dreamliner was grounded for
three months this year after  lithium-ion batteries  overheated on
two aircraft.  The  stock  rose 2.6 percent to $107.52 at 11:39 a.m in New
York. Boeing was trading at about $107.50 on July 12 before
reports of the blaze at Heathrow Airport on the parked 787
operated by Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise sent the shares to
their biggest drop in two years. The Dreamliner was empty at the
time and no one was injured.  The U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch said today that
the Honeywell emergency locater transmitter should be
deactivated on all other Dreamliners as a precautionary measure
“until appropriate airworthiness actions can be completed.”  Morris Township , New Jersey-based Honeywell, which makes
dozens of components for the aircraft, from distance measuring
equipment to tail-cone lights, has been invited to join the
investigation.  Honeywell (HON)  rose 0.8 percent to $83.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
