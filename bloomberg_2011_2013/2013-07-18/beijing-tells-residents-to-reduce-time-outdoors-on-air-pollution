Beijing advised the young, elderly
and ill among its 20 million residents to reduce time spent
outdoors as a U.S. Embassy pollution monitor showed air quality
in the Chinese capital at “heavily polluted” levels today.  Concentrations of PM2.5, fine air particulates that pose
the greatest health risk, rose to 241 micrograms per cubic meter
as of noontime near Tiananmen Square from an average of 124 in
the past 24 hours, according to the  Beijing Municipal
Environmental Monitoring Center . This compares with the World
Health Organization’s recommendation of no higher than 25 for
day-long exposure.  Chinese authorities have taken steps to curb the burning of
coal and reduce car traffic to assuage public anger sparked by
dirty air and water. Beijing Communist Party Secretary Guo Jinlong, the city administration’s highest ranking official,
pledged this week to improve air quality, telling a meeting of
municipal officials that controlling pollution is in the
people’s interests, consistent with Beijing’s development and
 China ’s national image, the Beijing Times reported today.  The Beijing Meteorological Bureau also issued a warning on
its official microblog today for residents to drive safely as
rain and haze reduce visibility.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
