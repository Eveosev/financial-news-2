Vodacom Group Ltd. (VOD) , South Africa’s
largest wireless operator, said revenue rose 3 percent in the
second quarter to 17.5 billion rand ($1.77 billion) as more
customers use smartphones.  Vodacom, which is 65 percent-owned by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ,
boosted subscriber numbers by 5.3 percent in the three months
through June to 51.5 million as international operations
continued to expand, the company said in a statement today.  “Data and the International operations remain key parts of
the growth story,” Chief Executive Officer Shameel Joosub said
in the statement.  Vodacom is becoming increasingly important for its Newbury,
England-based parent as Vodafone seeks ways to offset a slide in
its European businesses.  Vodacom  shares  rose for a third consecutive day yesterday,
extending their rally this week to 6.1 percent. The stock has
declined 8.5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent gain
by  MTN Ltd. (MTN) , South Africa’s second-biggest operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
