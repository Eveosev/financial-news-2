Empresa de Energia de Bogota SA , the
Colombian capital’s power utility, fell the most in 11 months as
state-controlled oil producer  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  said it may sell a
stake that was worth 915 billion pesos ($486 million) yesterday.  The shares dropped 2.8 percent to 1,410 pesos at 10:14 a.m.
in Bogota after tumbling 4.8 percent in the biggest intraday
decline since August 2012. EEB was the worst performer on the
Colcap index, which gained 0.4 percent. The stock fell for a
second day after rallying this week to a two-year high.  Ecopetrol said in a regulatory filing today that its board
approved taking steps toward a possible sale of its 6.9 percent
stake in EEB. Ecopetrol hasn’t set a date for a sale and doesn’t
yet have needed government authorization, according to the
filing.  “With both being public companies, there’s a lot of
uncertainty over what process the sale would take,” Jaime Pedroza, an analyst at Credicorp Capital’s Colombia unit in
Bogota, said in a telephone interview. “It’s a valuable company
and there could be a lot of investors interested, but
regulations may complicate the sale.”  Ecopetrol wants to focus on its “core” business, a press
official said in an e-mailed response to questions. Its shares
advanced 0.5 percent to 4,255 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
