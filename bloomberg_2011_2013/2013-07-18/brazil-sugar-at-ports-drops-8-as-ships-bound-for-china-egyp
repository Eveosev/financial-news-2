The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at ports in top producer  Brazil  fell 8 percent in a week
as vessels headed for China, Bangladesh and  Egypt , according to
data from Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  The total amount of sugar was 1.33 million metric tons at
Recife, Maceio, Vitoria, Paranagua and Santos, the country’s
biggest port, figures e-mailed yesterday from the Recife,
Brazil-based shipping agency showed. That compares with about
1.45 million tons a week earlier.  Vessels scheduled to go to China were set to take 151,912
tons of the sweetener, while those bound for Bangladesh would
carry 146,500 tons, the data show. Ships headed for Egypt were
set to take 94,250 tons and those to Canada 93,770 tons.  China was the world’s biggest raw sugar importer last
season and  Indonesia  is forecast to be the top buyer this year.  Raw sugar for delivery in October was 0.8 percent higher at
16.21 cents a pound by 4:42 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
