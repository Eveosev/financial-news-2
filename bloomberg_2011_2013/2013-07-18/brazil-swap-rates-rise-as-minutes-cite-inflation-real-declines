Brazil ’s swap rates climbed from a
one-month low as the central bank said in minutes of its July
policy meeting that it is appropriate to maintain the pace of
increases in borrowing costs to curb inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 9.41 percent at 10:09
a.m. in Sao Paulo after dropping yesterday to 9.36 percent, the
lowest level since June 7. The real slid 0.4 percent to 2.2360
per dollar after rising 1.2 percent yesterday.  Inflation is showing resilience as a weakening real boosts
prices, the central bank said in the minutes. Policy makers
raised the target lending  rate  by a half-percentage point to
8.50 percent on July 10 in the third increase this year. They
raised it by a quarter-percentage point in April from a record
low 7.25 percent and 50 basis points in May.  “The central bank showed it continues to be worried about
inflation,” Flavio Serrano, senior economist at Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento SA, said by phone from  Sao Paulo .
“They’re going to combat inflation in a timely way.”  Consumer prices  rose 6.70 percent in the 12 months through
June, the fastest pace in 20 months, exceeding the 6.50 percent
upper level of the central bank’s target range, the government
reported July 5.  The Getulio Vargas Foundation said today that the IGP-M
price index of wholesale, construction and consumer prices
increased 0.24 percent in the 20 days beginning June 21,
compared with the median forecast of 0.32 percent among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The real has lost 9.8 percent in the past three months, the
worst performance among major emerging-market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg, as accelerating inflation helped spur street
protests and hampered efforts to stimulate  Latin America ’s
largest economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
