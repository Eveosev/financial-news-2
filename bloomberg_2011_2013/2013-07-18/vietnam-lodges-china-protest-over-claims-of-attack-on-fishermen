Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung’s
government said a Chinese boat crew beat Vietnamese fishermen
near a disputed island chain, the third reported clash between
the neighboring countries in contested waters this year.  Vietnam , in a letter protesting the July 7 incident to the
 Chinese Embassy  in  Hanoi , requested an investigation and
compensation for the fishermen, who also lost personal property,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Luong Thanh Nghi said in a
statement yesterday. The Chinese vessel chased two Vietnamese
fishing boats near the Paracel Islands, he said, without
specifying the number of fishermen involved.  The incident adds to tensions between the two countries as
they vie for oil, gas and fish in the  South China Sea . Vietnam
in March said Chinese mariners fired on a fishing vessel, and
two months later demanded compensation after a Chinese ship
rammed another Vietnamese fishing boat.  A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment.  China has controlled the  Paracel Islands  since a battle
with Vietnam in 1974.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
