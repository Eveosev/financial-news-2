BB&T Corp. (BBT) , North Carolina’s second-biggest bank, posted a 7 percent increase in second-quarter
profit on improved performance at its insurance and securities
units and lower bad-loan charges.  Net income rose to $547 million, or 77 cents a share, from
$510 million, or 72 cents, a year earlier, the Winston-Salem-based bank said today in a statement. The  average estimate  of 32
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 74 cents a share.  “These results reflect record performances from our
insurance, investment-banking and brokerage, and trust and
investment-advisory businesses,” Chief Executive Officer Kelly King, 64, said in the statement. “Improvement in credit quality
accelerated this quarter.”  BB&T’s credit rating outlook was cut to negative from
stable by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service in
March after the Federal Reserve objected to the lender’s capital
plan. The bank’s shares have gained 20 percent this year,
compared with a 26 percent  advance  by the 24-company  KBW Bank
Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
