Let's imagine we live in a better, simpler world, where wishes come true and everyone uses the kitchen equipment they buy. Which is to say, let's imagine you use your ice cream maker. In this fairy tale world, are you actually saving money by DIYing it at home? Let's break it down. The machine itself? Take an average but decent ice cream maker, a stainless steel  Cuisinart , which retails for $79 online. Set that cost aside.  Now, say we make mint chocolate chip -- nothing too fancy, but more than plain vanilla. Taking a recipe from the Cuisinart  website , we'll reckon what it costs to make a batch of ice cream yourself, based on ingredients, preferably organic, from Fresh Direct. •2 cups 2%  milk  @ $3.99 per 1/2 gallon comes to $1 (8 cups in 1/2 gallon)  •2 cups  heavy cream  @ $2.99 per pint makes $2.99 (2 cups in a pint) •1 cup  sugar  @ $4.59 per 24oz package is $1.53 (8 ounces in a cup)  •1/2 teaspoon  salt  @ $2.69 per 48oz package adds up to $.005 (6 teaspoons in 1 ounce), so we'll round up to 1 cent  •1 teaspoon  vanilla extract  @ $7.99 per 4oz bottle will set you back 33 cents (6 teaspoons in 1 ounce) •1 teaspoon  peppermint extract  (can substitute mint extract) @ $10.75 per 4oz bottle comes to 44 cents (6 teaspoons in 1 ounce)  •1 cup miniature  semisweet chocolate chips  @ $8.99 per 9.7oz bar costs $7.41 (8 ounces in a cup)  The total of the combined ingredients, which are meant to make a quart of ice cream: $13.71. Compare that with the equivalent amount of  Haagen Dazs Mint Chip , which sells for $4.29 a pint. Are you still into this? Good. Multiply that by two to get a quart (the same volume as the homemade ingredients), and your total is $8.58, or 37% less than making the stuff yourself. And remember, that doesn't factor in the cost of the ice cream machine.  Are there other factors to consider? Sure. Some of the ice creams that you might want to make aren't commercially available; if you buy lower-market ingredients, the price of the ice cream drops a bit; and then there's the pride in having made something yourself (or so we're told).  We're still looking at a pretty big difference. You can whittle it down, but chances are commercially available ice cream is still going to be cheaper.  Maybe homemade ice cream isn't all it's cracked up to be. Everything has its price. Even fantasy.
