Citigroup Inc. (C) , the bank that took
the most U.S. aid during the credit crisis, and  Bank of America
Corp.  led dollar-denominated bond offerings today of at least
$11.3 billion.  Citigroup sold $1.5 billion of 1.7 percent, three-year debt

 Charlotte ,  North Carolina , issued $2 billion of 4.1 percent, 10-year debt at a relative yield of 157 basis points, Bloomberg
data show.  Other borrowers in the third-busiest day for sales in the
U.S. this month include Kroger Co., the largest U.S. grocer,
selling $1 billion of notes and Melbourne-based National
Australia Bank Ltd. offering $2.6 billion of bonds in three
parts, Bloomberg data show.  Citigroup’s $1.35 billion of 1.75 percent debentures due
May 2018 traded yesterday at 96.5 cents on the dollar to yield
2.54 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America’s $4.25 billion of 3.3 percent notes due in
January 2023 traded yesterday at 95 cents on the dollar to yield
3.94 percent, Trace data show. The bank reported net income of
$4.01 billion in the second quarter, a 63 percent increase, the
