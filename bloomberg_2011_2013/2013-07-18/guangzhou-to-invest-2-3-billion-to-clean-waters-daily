Guangzhou plans to spend 14 billion
 yuan  ($2.3 billion) to clean “black and smelly” river waters
by 2016, the  China ’s southern city’s daily newspaper reported.  Twelve sewage and rainwater-treatment plants will be built
over the next four years because more than a third of the
riverways are contaminated, the  Guangzhou Daily  said, citing
Mayor Chen Jianhua.  By 2020, Guangzhou will have cleaned up 43 waterways and
aims to have water in the Guangzhou section of the Pearl River
close to meeting drinking-water standards, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
