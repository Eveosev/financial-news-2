Europe ’s “onerous” caps on banker
bonuses are putting the region’s firms at a disadvantage to
their peers in the U.S. and  emerging markets  when hiring outside
their home market, according to a survey by Mercer LLC.  Three out of four firms polled said European Union rules
capping banker bonuses at no more than twice fixed pay have
created an “un-level playing field,” the human-resources
consultant said in an e-mailed statement today. Only 22 percent
said the rules benefitted their firms, Mercer said, citing the
April survey of 78 firms including BNP Paribas SA,  UBS AG (UBSN) , HSBC
Holdings Plc,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Deutsche Bank AG.  The EU introduced the restrictions in February to limit
excessive pay-outs and curb irresponsible risk taking after the
industry received a taxpayer rescue in 2008. The rules may
trigger an increase of 500 million pounds ($761 million) in
bankers’ total base salaries,  Andrew Bailey , Britain’s chief
banking supervisor, said in March.  “The clearest trend in the face of bonus caps is an
increase in base salaries,” said Vicki Elliott, senior partner
at Mercer, said in the statement. “With less variable pay that
can be linked to performance, there will also be less pay that
can be deferred and aligned with the risk time horizon of the
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
