Gasoline fell as supplies are rising
even as refiners have shut units for unplanned work and fuel
production is down.  Futures slipped as the Energy Information Administration
reported yesterday that  gasoline supplies  rose 3.06 million
barrels last week to 224.1 million. Demand sank 6.1 percent from
a week earlier.  Gasoline output  fell 5.6 percent to 9.05 million
barrels a day, the lowest rate in seven weeks, as refiners shut
process units.  “The build was quite surprising given the problems we’ve
seen and it’s pressuring gasoline prices,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  August-delivery gasoline fell 1.73 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $3.0928 a gallon at 9:36 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Trading volume was 22 percent above the 100-day
average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI fell $1.21 to $22.93 a
barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent fell 24 cents to $18.75.  Supplies on the  Gulf Coast , home to 45 percent of U.S.
refining capacity, rose 2.06 million barrels to 78.2 million,
the highest level in five months, according to EIA data.  Bill Day , a spokesman for  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  in  San Antonio  said
today that the fluid catalytic cracker remains shut for repairs
at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose a 10th consecutive
time, gaining 1.2 cents to $3.669 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the highest level
since March 23.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery rose 2.2 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $3.0932 a gallon on trading volume that was
12 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 47 cents to $22.98 a barrel. The  premium over Brent 
increased 98 cents to $21.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
