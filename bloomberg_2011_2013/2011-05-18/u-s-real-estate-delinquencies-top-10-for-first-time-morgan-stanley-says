Delinquencies on commercial mortgages
packaged and sold as bonds surpassed 10 percent for the first
time last month, according to Morgan Stanley.  Payments more than 30 days late jumped 26 basis points to
10.15 percent in April, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report
yesterday. While the pace of increase has slowed since the
middle of last year, that’s partly because delinquencies are
being offset as troubled loans are resolved. The rate of
borrowers missing payments for the first time has been constant
for the past four months, the analysts wrote.  “The bottom line is that loan performance is not yet
exhibiting significant improvement,” according to the analysts
led by Richard Parkus in  New York . “Many market participants
have come to believe that credit deterioration is more or less
over, and were caught off guard by April’s rise.”  Delinquency rates for loans bundled into securities during
the bubble years, when property values peaked amid lax
underwriting, have reached 10.37 percent for 2006 deals and
13.26 percent for those in 2007, according to Morgan Stanley.  Borrowers with maturing debt taken out during the boom are
still struggling to retire loans, according to the report. About
63 percent of commercial mortgages in bonds scheduled to mature
in April paid off on time. That rate dropped to 33 percent for
loans taken out from 2005 through 2008, the analysts said.  Sales of commercial-mortgage backed securities are rising
after plummeting to $3.4 billion in 2009 from a record $234
billion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Wall
Street  has sold $8.6 billion of the debt in 2011, compared with
$11.5 billion in all of last year, the data show. Sales may
reach $35 billion this year, according to Standard and Poor’s.  Property Values Down  New bond offerings provide financing to borrowers with
maturing loans. Still, property values are down 44.6 percent
from October 2007, according to Moody’s Investors Service,
making it difficult for property owners to come up with the
difference when repaying the debt.  “Loans originated after 2005 had weaker loan
characteristics,” Parkus said in a telephone interview. “On
top of that, they were done at the peak of the cycle so they
didn’t benefit from any price appreciation prior to the
crisis.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
