Oman  hired Cb&I Lummus BV, a
Netherlands-based engineering company, to expand the country’s
116,400 barrel-a-day Sohar refinery, the official Oman News
Agency reported.  The planned work will add 60 percent to the plant’s
processing capacity in 2015 and improve the quality of its
products, the report said today, citing a statement that Oil
Minister Mohammed Bin Hamed al-Rumhy made at the signing
ceremony for the contract.  Oman has the seventh-largest oil reserves in the Middle
East, according to data from BP Plc. The Arab Peninsula nation
is the largest non-OPEC producer in the region, pumping 810,000
barrels of crude a day in 2009, the data show.  The government-owned facility at the port of Sohar in
northern Oman is the larger of the country’s two refineries. An
85,000 barrel-a-day plant operates near Muscat, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
