Kentucky Derby champion  Animal
Kingdom  was made the 2-1 favorite in the 136th  Preakness Stakes ,
the second leg of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown.  Dialed In, Nick Zito’s Derby favorite, is next at 9-2,
followed by Mucho Macho Man at 6-1, according to the morning
line by Pimlico Race Course handicapper Frank Carulli.  Animal Kingdom will run from the 11th post position, Dialed
In starts from the 10th gate and Mucho Macho Man drew the ninth
post.  The May 21 race over 1 3/16 miles at Baltimore’s Pimlico
racetrack will be contested by 14 horses.  Animal Kingdom, training at Fair Hill Training Center in
northwestern  Maryland , won’t go to Pimlico until the morning of
the race, his trainer, Graham Motion said.  “The advantages are for staying in his stall until he has
to leave,” said Motion, who won his first Derby with Animal
Kingdom.  One horse has won the Preakness from the 11th post position
-- Tabasco Cat in 1994. Animal Kingdom, ridden by John Velazquez,
will be running only his second race on a dirt track.  “He is in great form. He came out of the race super,”
said Motion, whose previous three Preakness entries never ran
better than third. “He hasn’t missed a meal.”  Zito, who won the Preakness in 1996 with Louis Quatorze,
said Dialed In “didn’t lose anything in stature” when the colt
came in eighth in the Derby.  “Nick Zito still believes Dialed In is the best 3-year-old
in the country and if he can come with his best game, he can run
down Animal Kingdom,” Zito said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
