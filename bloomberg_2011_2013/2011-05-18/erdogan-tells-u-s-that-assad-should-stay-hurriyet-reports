Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad
should stay in power and immediately enact democratic reforms,
Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  told U.S. Ambassador
Francis Riccardione, Hurriyet newspaper reported.  A worsening situation in Syria, where protesters have been
calling for Assad to resign, would quickly spread beyond the
country’s borders and affect neighbors, which include  Turkey ,
Lebanon, Iraq and Israel, Erdogan told the U.S. ambassador
according to Hurriyet, which didn’t say how it got the
information. The two men met on a helicopter pad in Ankara for
about an hour yesterday, it said.  The meeting was requested by Riccardione before U.S.
President Barack Obama makes a speech in which he’s expected to
address events in the Middle East, Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
