Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s largest
drugmaker, said a study showed that its experimental drug
axitinib was more effective in treating advanced kidney cancer
than  Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s Nexavar.  In a late-stage trial of 723 patients with advanced kidney
cancer who had received other treatments, patients who received
axitinib lived a median of 6.7 months before their tumors
progressed, compared with 4.7 months for patients who received
Nexavar, New York-based Pfizer said in a statement. The data is
being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology on
June 6 and a summary of the study was released today.  Nexavar, known by its chemical name of sorafenib, is sold
by Bayer, based in Leverkusen, Germany, in collaboration with
 Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)  of South San Francisco, California.
The medicine, also approved for  liver cancer , generated $935
million in 2010 sales, Bayer reported.  While Pfizer announced in November 2010 that the trial was
successful, it didn’t release details at the time. The company
said today it is working with global regulators on filing for
approval for kidney cancer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
