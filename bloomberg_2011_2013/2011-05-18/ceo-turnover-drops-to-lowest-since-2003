Chief executive officer turnover had
the biggest year-over-year drop of the past decade in 2010,
reaching its lowest rate since 2003,  Booz & Co.  said.  A total of 291 CEOs left their companies last year, the New
York-based management consulting firm said in a report this
week. CEO succession at the world’s 2,500 largest public
companies by market capitalization last year declined 19 percent
to 11.6 percent, the lowest rate since 2003.  China ’s 5.2 percent
turnover rate contributed to the overall decline, and  Japan  had
the highest rate, according to a statement yesterday announcing
the study.  CEOs are increasingly based in emerging markets as more
than one-fourth of the biggest 2,500 companies have their
headquarters in an emerging economy. The number of companies
based in the U.S.,  Canada  and western  Europe  fell about 28
percent from 2000, the study showed.  Asia  had 895 of the top
companies versus 772 in North America and 619 in Europe.  “Could this suggest that global enterprise is nearing a
geographic tipping point?,” Booz & Co. said. “Within a few
years, if this pattern continues, the companies in the world’s
mature Western economies could represent a minority of our
sample.”  CEOs forced from office dropped to 2.2 percent last year,
while planned departures fell to 7.7 percent. In 2009, the
succession rate was 11 percent in  North America , 10 percent in
Europe, 19 percent in Japan and 10 percent in the rest of Asia.  More CEOs were chosen from within the company, according to
the study. Insiders left after an average 7.1 years versus 4.3
years for outsiders, and last year they produced a 4.6 percent
shareholder return on a regionally adjusted basis compared with
0.1 percent for outsiders. The mean CEO tenure was 6.6 years in
2010, 18 months shorter than in 2000.  Fewer CEOs are also chairmen, and only 14 percent of
incoming CEOs in North America had both titles, versus 52
percent in 2001. The average appointment age was 52.2 in 2010,
compared with 50.2 in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
