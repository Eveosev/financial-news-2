The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
commodity-shipping costs, retreated, led by a surplus of panamax
vessels for hire to haul coal,  iron ore  and grain.  The index fell 0.2 percent to 1,271 points today, data from
the  Baltic Exchange  in  London  showed. That’s the lowest since
April 28. The slide was led by a 1.6 percent drop in panamax
rents to $12,806 a day. The decline may continue, Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst with Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, said.  “We expect a further weakening in the panamax market as
reports indicate a high number of vessels available,” Stavseth
said in an e-mailed note today before the data were released.
“The current power shortage in China and low stockpiles are
likely to lift coal imports, but we do not expect it to be
enough to lift rates meaningfully.”  China  is the world’s biggest coal consumer. Inventories of
the fuel at the country’s Qinhuangdao port have dropped 30
percent since March when they rose to 850.3 million metric tons,
the most since at least March, 2010, according to data from
Shanghai Steelhome Information. The country may face a summer
shortage of 30 gigawatts of power as supply lags behind demand
growth, the China Electricity Council said on April 29.  Shipowners ordered too many vessels in 2007 and 2008, when
the index averaged 6,730 points. The average then plunged 60
percent over the next two years. Carrying capacity of the entire
dry-bulk fleet will increase 13 percent compared with 5 percent
demand growth, according to estimates from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the
world’s biggest shipbroker. Panamaxes’ capacity will rise 11
percent, it forecasts.  Daily rents for capesizes, the biggest ships tracked by the
index, rose 0.6 percent to $5,688 today, the first advance since
May 6. Supramaxes gained 0.4 percent to $14,625, while
handysizes were little changed at $11,679.  To contact the reporter on this story:
