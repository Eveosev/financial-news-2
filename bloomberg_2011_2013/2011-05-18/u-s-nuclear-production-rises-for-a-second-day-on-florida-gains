U.S. nuclear-power production rose
for a second day as  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  started the Saint Lucie
2 reactor in  Florida  and  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  switched on the
Brunswick 1 unit in  North Carolina , the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 455 megawatts from
yesterday to 77,185 megawatts, or 76 percent of capacity, the
most since May 13, according to an NRC report today and data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors
were offline.  Progress is operating the 938-megawatt Brunswick 1 reactor
at 31 percent of capacity after shutting it on May 14. The 937-
megawatt Brunswick 2, another unit at the site, is operating at
full power.  The plant is located at Cape Fear on the Atlantic Ocean,
130 miles (209 kilometers) south of Raleigh.  NextEra is operating the 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 2 reactor
at 11 percent of capacity. The unit was shut on May 16 after
powering up from a refueling outage. Saint Lucie 1 is operating
at full power. The plant is located about 45 miles north of  Palm
Beach .  NextEra boosted the 693-megawatt Turkey Point 4 Reactor in
Florida to 48 percent of capacity from 41 percent yesterday. The
reactor was shut for refueling and maintenance from March 21 to
May 2, then closed again on May 6. The plant is located about 20
miles south of Miami.  Turkey Point 3 is operating at full power.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
