Nigeria revised April inflation to
11.3 percent, less than previously reported, after the  National
Bureau of Statistics  detected a mistake in its calculation.  The inflation rate fell from 12.8 percent a month earlier,
the statistics agency said in a statement handed to reporters
today in Abuja, the capital, correcting the inflation rate of
11.6 percent issued on May 16.  The revision may give central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi
more room to keep  interest rates  unchanged as he looks to
stimulate lending. The central bank on March 22 raised the
benchmark interest rate for a second time this year, lifting it
one percentage point to 7.5 percent to stabilize the naira and
help bring inflation to its 10 percent target.  “Although the naira remains weak and the effects of loose
fiscal policy are still being felt, we think the CBN will wait
for the impact of its last one percentage point hike to be fully
absorbed before adjusting rates again,”  Alan Cameron , a London-
based analyst at CSL Stockbrokers Ltd., said today in an e-
mailed response to questions.  Nigeria’s economy, the third biggest on the continent after
 South Africa  and  Egypt , will grow about 7.9 percent in the
second quarter, according to the statistics office. The economy
is projected to expand 7.98 percent this year, compared with
7.85 percent in 2010.  The mistake in calculating inflation came after
statisticians took data for food prices and fed it into the
index for food and non-alcoholic drinks, the statistics bureau
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
