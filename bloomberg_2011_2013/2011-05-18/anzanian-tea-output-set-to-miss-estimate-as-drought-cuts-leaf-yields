Tanzania’s tea crop, the fourth-
largest in  Africa , is set to miss an initial estimate by 8.6
percent in the current 2010-11 season after a drought cut
yields, according to the Tea Board of Tanzania.  Production may come to 32,000 metric tons in the year
through June, compared with the prior 35,000-ton estimate,
Director General Mathias Assenga said yesterday by phone from
the commercial center of  Dar es Salaam . Output is just 1,500
tons short of the reduced goal, he said. Farmers grew 33,000
tons of the leaves in the prior year, board figures show.  “This season the weather has not been very good,
especially since September,” Assenga said. “We cannot achieve
35,000 tons, but 32,000 tons, and we are now remaining with a
little volume to achieve this.”  Tanzania exported 28,064 tons of the leaves in the 2009-10
season worth about $57 million, according to the board.
Agriculture generates more than 40 percent of the country’s
gross domestic product, the CIA World Factbook shows. The board
is trying to encourage farmers to introduce the crop to areas
bordering  Kenya  and to use more fertilizers.  “Production by some estates will be a little bit up
because of increased care, and volumes from Usambara in the
north will improve because of a replanting program,” said
Assenga.  Field Management  Still, output in the coming 2011-12 year may be 35,000
tons, 3 percent lower than the March 11 forecast of 36,000 tons,
because of adverse weather, he said. Wider planting and improved
field management may raise production from the current period,
he said.  The March projection for the next season’s output would be
18 percent lower than the 44,000-ton target in 2008, Assenga
said, citing lower-than-anticipated planting and adverse
weather. A sowing plan that’s in progress may raise production
to 44,000 tons in the 2015-16 year, he said.  Tanzania, East Africa’s second-biggest economy, ranks
behind Kenya, Malawi and  Uganda  in tea production on the
continent, according to the  United Nations ’ Food and
Agricultural Organization. The main Tanzanian growing areas are
Iringa and Mbeya in the south, Tanga in the northeast and Kagera
in the northwest.  Four-fifths of the country’s tea is sold to foreign buyers
from the U.K. and  Germany  to  India  and the  United Arab Emirates .
About half of Tanzanian tea exports are channeled through the
world’s biggest auction for the leaves in the port city of
Mombasa in neighboring Kenya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
