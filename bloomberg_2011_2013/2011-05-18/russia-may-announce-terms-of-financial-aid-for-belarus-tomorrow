Russia  has agreed on the technical
aspects of financial aid for Belarus and may make an official
announcement tomorrow, central bank Deputy Chairman Sergei Shvetsov said.  "The agreement has largely been coordinated," Shvetsov said
in an interview in Moscow today. "I think we would hear some
positive news concerning potential assistance to the Belarusian
central bank on" May 19. The Belarusian capital Minsk will host
a meeting of the leaders of the  Commonwealth of Independent
States  tomorrow.  Russia and Belarus agreed on a loan worth between $3
billion and $3.5 billion loan, according to a statement from
Belarus Prime Minister Mikhail Myasnikovich, posted on the
governmentâ€™s website yesterday.  The Belarusian ruble plunged about 56 percent on the
 interbank market  since April 19, when the threat of a currency
crisis forced the central bank trading restrictions. March gold
and currency reserves fell the lowest in 18 months.  "The Belarusian central bank will also be required to take
a number of steps aimed at stabilization," Shvetsov said. "Some
of these may not be popular. Yet this is the sacrifice that
needs to be made for the situation to improve, not worsen."
