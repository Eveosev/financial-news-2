Treasury 10-year yields may fall
below 3 percent after breaking through the so-called neckline of
a head-and-shoulders pattern, according to Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.  The pattern is formed by highs reached on Dec. 16, Feb. 9
and April 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields
dropped as low as 3.10 percent yesterday, falling below the
neckline at about 3.15 percent that connects the base of the
three peaks, said Kenichi Imai, chief manager of proprietary
trading at the unit of  Japan ’s largest bank.  “A clear break below the 3.15 percent level suggests
yields will head toward a 200-day moving average at 3.06
percent,” Tokyo-based Imai said. “Rates may even drop below 3
percent,” he said.  Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 3.13 percent as of 9:33 a.m.
in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The rate
was last below 3 percent on Dec. 7, 2010.  A head-and-shoulders pattern is formed by three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline is seen to indicate a trend is about to reverse.  Yields had remained near the neckline for almost two weeks
before falling through, Bloomberg data show.  Ten-year yields will rise to 3.66 percent by Sept. 30 and
3.82 percent by year-end, according to a Bloomberg News survey
of financial companies with the most recent forecasts given the
heaviest weightings.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
