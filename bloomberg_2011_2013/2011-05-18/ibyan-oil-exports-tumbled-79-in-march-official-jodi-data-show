Libya ’s crude exports slumped 79
percent in March to 202,000 barrels a day, from 981,000 barrels
daily in February, as political unrest curbed shipments,
official data showed.  The country’s oil production declined to 290,000 barrels a
day in March, from February’s 1.272 million, according to
Libya’s official data posted on the Joint Organization Data
Initiative website today. The initiative is supervised by the
Riyadh-based  International Energy Forum  and shows historical
data supplied directly by governments.  Angola and  Nigeria , the two West African OPEC members that
produce light, “sweet” crudes similar to those of Libya,
showed little change in exports from February to March.  Angolan exports were shown as 1.488 million barrels a day
for both months, according to the JODI data, while Nigerian
exports fell to 2.242 million barrels a day, from 2.298 million.  The total export figure for the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries reflected the reduction in Libyan shipments
and a decline from  Saudi Arabia , with JODI data showing March
OPEC exports at 21.665 million barrels a day, versus 22.909
million for February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
