Variable-annuity sales in the U.S.
increased for the fifth straight quarter, led by gains at
 Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET) , as rising stock
markets and changing terms spurred demand.  Sales climbed to  $38.9 billion , or 24 percent, in the first
quarter from $32.2 billion a year earlier, trade group Limra
said today on its website. Prudential, the top provider of the
retirement products, sold $6.81 billion, a 40 percent increase
from a year earlier. New York-based MetLife ranked second as
sales rose 41 percent to $5.68 billion.  Sales of equity-linked variable annuities increased as
stock markets rebounded from March 2009 lows, cutting the risk
insurers will shoulder losses on customers’ guaranteed returns.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 5.4 percent in the first
quarter after rising 13 percent last year. Savers may have
boosted investments to lock in terms ahead of scheduled changes
in benefits and fees.  “It’s reasonable to assume that a portion of our first-
quarter sales represented accelerated purchases due to the
anticipated product changeover,” Mark Grier, vice chairman of
the  Newark , New Jersey-based insurer, said on May 5 during a
call with analysts to discuss first-quarter results.  MetLife has also changed terms, reducing guaranteed payout
rates, Robert Sollmann, executive vice president of retirement
products, said at a conference in February.  Insurers lost money on the products in 2008 and early 2009
because the funds are generally invested in stocks. The  S&P 500 
declined 38 percent in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
