Saudi Arabia , the biggest Arab
economy, is likely to see inflation slow in the medium- to long-
term as government spending helps provide more homes, the  Saudi
Arabian Monetary Agency  said today.  King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud’s decision to build
500,000 homes and boost the cap on loans at the Mortgage
Development Fund to 500,000 riyals ($133,330) will increase the
number of private residences owned by Saudis and ease prices,
SAMA said in a report on  its website today . Food prices are
likely to moderate in the second quarter in tandem with a drop
in worldwide food costs, the report said.  The kingdom, which depends on oil for 86 percent of its
revenue, announced increases in  government spending  in March as
protests calling for more job opportunities and democracy
engulfed the Middle East. The package included $67 billion on
housing and funds for the military and religious groups that
backed the government’s ban on domestic protests, and followed a
$36 billion handout announced on Feb. 23.  Inflation in the kingdom accelerated to 4.8 percent in
April, compared with 4.7 percent in the previous month, the
Central Department of Statistics said May 14. Inflation is
forecast at 6 percent this year, the  International Monetary Fund 
said on April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
