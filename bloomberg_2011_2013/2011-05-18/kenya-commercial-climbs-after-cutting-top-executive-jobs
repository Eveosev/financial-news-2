Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, gained for the
first day in eight after it reduced the number of people on its
executive committee to seven from 22.  The company’s stock gained as much as 2 percent to 25.25
shillings before trading 1 percent higher at 25 shillings by
11:55 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  The reduction will make  Kenya  Commercial a “lean
organization that will allow for faster decision making for the
benefit of the bank’s customers and other stakeholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Oduor-Otieno said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
