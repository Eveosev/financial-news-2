TMX Group Inc. (X) , the Toronto Stock
Exchange owner that’s facing two rival takeover offers, had 66.3
percent of the Canadian market for stock trading in April, up
about half a percent from March.  Alpha Group, whose owners include  Canada ’s six largest
banks, had 21 percent of the market for trading, down about half
a percent from March, according to monthly  statistics  from the
Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada.  TMX’s market share has fallen from a year earlier, when the
Toronto Stock Exchange and  TSX Venture Exchange  had 72.5 percent
of the market. Alpha had 21.3 percent of the market in April
2010.  TMX, which had 99 percent of the market at the start of
2007, has seen its share of trading dwindle with the emergence
of alternative trading systems including Alpha, Pure Trading and
Instinet’s Chi-X platforms in Canada.  A group of Canadian banks and pension funds offered on May
13 to buy TMX in a C$3.6 billion ($3.7 billion) cash-and-stock
transaction worth about C$48 a share, trumping a Feb. 9 all-
stock agreement between the  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  and
TMX.  The Canadian offer by Maple Group Acquisition Corp. would
seek to integrate Alpha into the TMX after completing a takeover
of the Toronto Stock Exchange owner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
