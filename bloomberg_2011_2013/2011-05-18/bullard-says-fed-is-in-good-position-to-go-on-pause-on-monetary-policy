Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said the central bank is in a “fairly
good position” to pause in its stimulus and that “it is
reasonable” to expect policy tightening by the end of 2011.  “We are in fairly good position right now with QE2 coming
to an end,” Bullard said today in a Bloomberg Television
interview in New York. “I still think it is reasonable” to
expect tightening by end of year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
