New York Mets  third baseman  David Wright  will be put on the 15-day disabled list today with a
stress fracture in his lower back, an injury that occurred about
one month ago.  The fracture was discovered during a scan two days ago and
confirmed by further tests.  Wright, 28, will have no baseball activity for 10 days
before being re-evaluated at the Manhattan-based  Hospital for
Special Surgery , the Mets said yesterday in a news release.  The five-time Major League Baseball All-Star was injured
April 19 when he dove to make a tag at third base, Mets General
Manager Sandy Alderson said. Wright has a .226 batting average
this season, with six home runs, 18 runs batted in and nine
stolen bases.  The Mets will replace Wright on the roster with infielder
Nick Evans from their Triple-A minor-league affiliate in Buffalo.  Last night’s Mets game against the  Florida Marlins  at Citi
Field in  New York  was postponed because of rain. It’s been
rescheduled for July 18, which was a day off for both teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
