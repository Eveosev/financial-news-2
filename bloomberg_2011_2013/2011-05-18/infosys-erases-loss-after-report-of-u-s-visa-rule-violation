Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO)  erased
losses after falling as much as 1.5 percent following a CNBC
TV18 report that said a U.S.-based employee filed a suit against
the Indian company for improper use of business visas.  The most recent case filed against Infosys in the U.S. was
a complaint by an employee in Lowndes County,  Alabama , on March
23. Jack “Jay” Palmer Jr. alleged the company was misusing the
B-1 visa, a permit for temporary business visitors, to get
around H-1B visa limitations, court documents show. CNBC didn’t
say where it got the information for today’s report.  The H-1B visa allows skilled overseas workers to be
employed in the U.S. in specialty occupations. Infosys fell 0.1
percent to 2,843 rupees at 1:51 p.m. in Mumbai. The benchmark
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, was little changed.  Priyanka Waghre, a spokeswoman at the Infosys, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
