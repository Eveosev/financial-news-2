ECM Real Estate Investments AG (ECM) , the
developer that filed for insolvency yesterday, said its first-
quarter loss widened as it raised less money than forecast from
the sale of a unit and re-valued a residential project in
Prague.  The net loss for three months ended March 31 was 12.4
million euro ($17.7 million), compared with 6 million euros a
year earlier, the Luxembourg-based developer said in an e-mailed
statement. Total assets fell 5 percent to 148.6 million euros.  ECM filed an insolvency petition yesterday, saying it aims
to reorganize its business and debt. Two of the developer’s
creditors Ceska Sporitelna AS and Volksbank AS filed their own
insolvency proposals for ECM to the Municipal Court in  Prague  in
April for breaching covenants.  ECM’s board will hold meetings with creditors within
“coming days and weeks,” the company said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
