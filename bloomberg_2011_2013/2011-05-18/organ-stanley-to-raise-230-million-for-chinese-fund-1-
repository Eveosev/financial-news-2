Morgan Stanley (MS)  said it aims to raise
1.5 billion yuan ($230 million) with a local partner for private
equity investments in China.  Morgan Stanley holds an 80 percent stake in the joint
venture with Hangzhou Industrial & Commercial Trust Co. owning
the rest, according to a press release distributed in eastern
China’s Hangzhou city. Morgan Stanley (China) Private Equity
Investment Management Co. will focus investment opportunities on
Hangzhou and the Zhejiang province, it said.  The U.S. bank follows  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Carlyle Group
in raising funds to compete with local rivals including Hony
Capital Ltd. as China steps up efforts to develop its own buyout
firms and strengthen capital markets. Private-equity investments
in  China  jumped 40 percent to $19.7 billion last year, according
to the Asian Venture Capital Journal.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity manager, in
2009 became the first global buyout firm to announce plans for a
local-currency fund in China, followed by TPG Inc. and Carlyle.
The three firms have announced plans to raise a combined 20
billion yuan for local-currency funds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
