U.K. lenders that have to repay
billions of pounds of improperly sold payment-protection
insurance failed in a bid to have the interest rate on
compensation claims reduced, the Financial Times reported. The
banks approached the Financial Services Authority before
launching an unsuccessful court case to block the claims, the FT
said, citing a previously unreported section of a consultation
paper published by the FSA in March 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
