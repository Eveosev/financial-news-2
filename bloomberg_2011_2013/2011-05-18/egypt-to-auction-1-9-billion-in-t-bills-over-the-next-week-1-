Egypt ’s central bank said it plans to
raise 11.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.9 billion) in auctions of
treasury bills over the next week amid rising yields for all
four maturities of notes to be sold.  The central bank will sell 2.5 billion pounds in six-month
notes and 3.5 billion pounds in one-year notes tomorrow, it said
on Bloomberg today. It plans to sell 2 billion pounds in three-
month notes and 3.5 billion pounds in nine-month notes on May
22, it said.  Average yields on all maturities except the one-year notes
have climbed at least 50 basis points, or half a percentage
point, in the past month amid an economic decline and growing
 budget deficit  following the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak 
in February. The yield on one-year bills rose 40 basis points
over the same period.  The yield on Egypt’s 10-year dollar bond maturing in April
2020 fell 3 basis points to 6.15 percent at 2:34 p.m. in Cairo.
The pound was little changed at 5.9495 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
