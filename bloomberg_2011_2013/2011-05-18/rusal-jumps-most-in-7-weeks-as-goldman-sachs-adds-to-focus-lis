United Co. Rusal jumped by the most
in almost seven weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the
world’s biggest aluminum producer to its Russia focus list,
citing the stock’s underperformance.  The company’s Russian depositary receipts gained 2.2
percent to 390.92 rubles by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow,
snapping four days of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
