Cie. d’Entreprises CFE SA, the
construction firm that owns half of Dredging Environmental &
Marine Engineering NV, said 2011 revenue will be stable after
the value of outstanding orders climbed to a two-year high.  First-quarter revenue rose 5.2 percent to 393.8 million
euros ($561.5 million) after less favorable weather conditions
held back construction work a year earlier, the Brussels-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. CFE’s share of
DEME’s revenue in the three-month period was little changed at
193.2 million euros.  The value of outstanding orders, a measure of future
revenue, rose 15 percent from the prior quarter to 2.22 billion
euros. That’s the highest value since January 2009. Analysts had
projected an order book of 2.07 billion euros, according to the
median of four estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  DEME’s order book expanded 23 percent in the quarter and
the value of construction orders increased 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
