People in the Seychelles, the Indian
Ocean archipelago dependent on tourism for its foreign currency
earnings, will begin voting in presidential elections tomorrow.  About 69,000 registered voters have until May 21 to chose
between President James Michel, who leads the  People’s Party ,
Wavel Ramkalawan of the Seychelles Nationalist Party and Ralph
Volcere from the  National Democratic Party .  Michel has been in office since 2004 after replacing the
People’s Party leader France Albert Rene, who came to power in a
coup in 1977. Michel was re-elected in 2006 with 53.7 percent of
the vote against Ramkalawan’s 45.7 percent.  Observers from the Commonwealth and the Southern African
Development Community will monitor the election, both groups
said on their websites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
