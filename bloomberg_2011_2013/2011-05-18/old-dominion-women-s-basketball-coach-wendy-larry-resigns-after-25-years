Wendy Larry is stepping down as Old
Dominion University’s women’s basketball coach after 25 seasons.  Larry, 56, compiled a 608-234 overall record and 559-203
mark since joining Old Dominion in 1987. She was head coach at
Virginia Wesleyan College in 1978-79 and at the  University of
Arizona  in 1985-87 before taking over at ODU.  “I was truly blessed to have coached hundreds of student-
athletes who wore the Lady Monarch uniform with pride,” Larry
said on Old Dominion’s website.  Her teams reached 20 National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournaments, won an NCAA record-setting 17
consecutive Colonial Athletic Association titles from 1992-2008
and advanced to the 1997 NCAA tournament championship game.  “Wendy and Lady Monarch basketball are synonymous,”
Athletic Director Wood Selig said. “Wendy has been a consistent
thread, as a student-athlete and coach, throughout much of our
program’s national success.”  Larry will remain at the Norfolk, Virginia-based school to
work on athletic-related fundraising projects and alumni events.  To contact the reporter on this story:
