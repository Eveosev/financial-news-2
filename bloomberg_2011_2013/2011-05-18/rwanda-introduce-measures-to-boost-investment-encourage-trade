Rwanda introduced measures aimed at
boosting investment and encouraging construction and cross-
border trade, said Clare Akamanzi, chief operating officer of
the  Rwanda Development Board .  The changes will reduce paper-work, fees and waiting times
for businesses and traders, Akamanzi told reporters today in
Kigali, the capital. Other steps being taken include
streamlining insolvency procedures and increasing the
availability of credit.  “The point of our reforms is to keep those documents and
those procedures only where they are necessary and to remove
them when they are not necessary,” Akamanzi said.  Rwanda was the world’s leading business reformer in 2008
and 2009, according to a 2011 World Bank report. The East
African country was also ranked the 58th in the world in terms
of the ease of doing business. The government aims to be in the
top 30 within the next seven years, Akamanzi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
