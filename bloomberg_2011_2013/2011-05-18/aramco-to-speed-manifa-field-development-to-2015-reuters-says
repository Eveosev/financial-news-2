Saudi Arabia ’s Manifa oil field will
produce at full capacity of 900,000 barrels a day by 2015, nine
years ahead of the original plan, Reuters reported, citing an
unidentified company executive.  Manifa is on schedule to produce 500,000 barrels a day in
2013, according to the report.  Saudi Aramco , the country’s
state-run producer, had said in its 2009 annual review that the
field would not pump at full capacity until January 2024.  To contact the reporter on this story:
