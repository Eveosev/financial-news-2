Socialist Francois Hollande would
narrowly win the first round of the French presidential election
if he was the party’s candidate and the vote was held now,
according to a survey by the CSA pollster.  Hollande would get 23 percent of the votes, versus 22
percent for current president  Nicolas Sarkozy  and 20 percent for
National Front leader Marine Le Pen, according to the poll
carried out on May 16.  Martine Aubry  would also get 23 percent as the socialist
candidate, and would therefore tie with Sarkozy, the poll
showed. Segolene Royal would score 18 percent and would fail to
get to the second round, which would be contested by Sarkozy
with 23 percent and Le Pen on 20 percent.  The survey was carried out on May 16 by telephone with a
sample of 1,007 people, the CSA said on its website. No margin
of error was given.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
