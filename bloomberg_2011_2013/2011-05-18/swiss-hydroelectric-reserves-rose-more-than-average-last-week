Swiss hydroelectric reserves rose
more than average last week, boosting the availability of water
used to generate power in the country.  Reservoir levels climbed 2.9 percentage points to 15.7
percent full in the week through May 16, the Bern, Switzerland-
based Swiss Federal Energy Office said today in an e-mailed
statement. They typically advance 2.3 points in the week,
according to data kept since 1997. The rise was the second this
year.  Water levels in  Switzerland  are 5.6 percentage points below
the long-term average, the data show. Switzerland relies on
hydropower for more than half its annual electricity consumption
of about 55 terawatt-hours. Water supplies typically fall from
October to April during the winter season and are replenished
from May to September by rain and melting snow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
