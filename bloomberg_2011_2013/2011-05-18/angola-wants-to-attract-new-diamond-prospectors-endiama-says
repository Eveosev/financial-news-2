Angola  wants to bring investors to
prospect for new diamonds in the southern African nation, said
Antonio Carlos Sumbula, chairman of the state-owned gem miner
Endiama EP.  “Diamond prices have improved, now we go to the next
stage,” he told reporters yesterday in Luanda, the capital.
“We’re seeking new investors so they can prospect new areas and
identify new reserves.”  Endiama has discussed investments with Russia’s Alrosa Co.
Ltd., which operates the Catoca diamond mine in Angola, as well
as South African and Israeli companies, he said.  In March, Angola’s government dropped a policy that stated
Endiama had to own 51 percent of every concession of kimberlite,
a diamond-bearing ore body, in the country because it
discouraged investments, Sumbula said. Now, Endiama’s shares
will be negotiated with each company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
