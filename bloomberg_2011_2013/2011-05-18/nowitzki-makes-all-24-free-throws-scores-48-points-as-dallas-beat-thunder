The  Dallas Mavericks  opened the
National Basketball Association Western Conference finals with a
121-112 home win against the  Oklahoma City  Thunder.  Dirk Nowitzki  made all 24 of his free-throw attempts and
scored 48 points for the Mavericks at American Airlines Center
in  Dallas .  The series pits the youth of Oklahoma City against the
experience of the Mavericks. While nine of Dallas’ 15 players
are in their thirties, 11 of Oklahoma City’s 15-man roster are
26 or younger. The top four postseason scorers for the Thunder
are aged 22 or under, while Dallas’ three highest scorers are 32
and 33.  The winner of the best-of-seven-game series will play the
 Miami Heat  or  Chicago Bulls . That series resumes in  Chicago 
tomorrow, with the Bulls leading 1-0 in games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
