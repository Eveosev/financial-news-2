Serbia ’s economic growth accelerated
to an annual 2.4 percent in the first quarter, driven by rising
domestic demand as the dinar’s gains curbed net exports,
according to an estimate from the National Bank of Serbia.  First quarter growth picked up from 1.7 percent in the
previous three months and the pace of expansion may reach 3
percent in 2011, the Belgrade-based bank said in a report today.
Inflation probably peaked in April or May is likely to fall to
the target band of between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent in the
first half of 2012, it said.  Policy makers will "probably continue to pursue a
restrictive monetary policy in the coming period, using all
available instruments," the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
