The cost of insuring European
government debt rose, according to traders of credit-default
swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 3 basis points to 181. Contracts on  Greece 
increased 7 basis points to 1,276, Ireland rose 8.5 to 618.5 and
Portugal jumped 12.5 to 618, while Italy increased 1 to 148 and
 Spain  was 3 higher at 240.  Corporate bond risk was little changed, with the Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings 1 basis point lower at 357. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings was
unchanged at 98 basis points.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
