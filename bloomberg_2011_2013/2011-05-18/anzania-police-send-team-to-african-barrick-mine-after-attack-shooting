Tanzania’s police today sent a team
to the African Barrick Gold Plc’s North Mara mine after an
attack on the property led to the fatal shooting of seven
intruders.  The team will determine whether security personnel in the
region need to be reinforced, Khamis Kagasheki, the deputy
minister for home affairs, told reporters in  Dar es Salaam , the
country’s commercial capital, today.  The country’s mines ministry has sent a separate team to
consult with the community from where the attackers came.  To contact the reporter on this story:
