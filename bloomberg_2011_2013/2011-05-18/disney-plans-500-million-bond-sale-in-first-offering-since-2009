Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , the world’s biggest
theme-park operator, issued $500 million of notes as it returns
to the  bond market  for the first time in more than two years.  Borrowers from railroad  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  to
Cincinnati-based  Cintas Corp. (CTAS)  are selling at least $8.05 billion
of bonds in the U.S. today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales of $30.3 billion through yesterday are the most
to start a week since the two-day period ended March 22,
Bloomberg data show.  Disney, ranked A2 by Moody’s Investors Service and A by
 Standard & Poor’s , is taking advantage of the lowest borrowing
costs in more than six months. Yields on investment-grade
corporate bonds averaged 3.75 percent yesterday, compared with
3.65 percent on Nov. 11, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data.  Burbank, California-based Disney sold the 3.75 percent, 10-
year bonds at a yield of 60 basis points, or 0.6 percentage
point, more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc managed the issue.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
according to a person with knowledge of the offering who
declined by identified because they weren’t authorized to
discuss the transaction.  In its last offering in March 2009, Disney issued $500
million of 5.5 percent, 10-year notes that paid a spread of
262.5 basis points, Bloomberg data show.  Norfolk Southern sold $400 million of 6 percent, 100-year
bonds in its second sale of such debt in the past year,
Bloomberg data show. Cintas marketed $500 million of five- and
10-year notes in its first offering since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
