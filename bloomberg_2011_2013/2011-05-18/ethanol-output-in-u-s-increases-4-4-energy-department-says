Ethanol output in the U.S. increased
4.4 percent to 900,000 barrels a day last week, according to the
Energy Department.  Stockpiles declined 27,000 barrels to 20.4 million, the
department said in a report released in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
advanced 4.3 percent to 5.08 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 3.3 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.617 a gallon at 10:42 a.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
