Corn rose for a fifth day in Chicago,
the longest streak since December, as wet weather delays sowing
from  North Dakota  to  Ohio . Wheat gained for a third day as a
lack of rain in growing countries hurts yields.  About 63 percent of the U.S. corn crop was  sown  as of May
15, behind the five-year average of 75 percent, the Department
of Agriculture said May 16. April was the second-hottest since
1900 in  France ,  Europe ’s biggest wheat grower, and England’s
warmest in 352 years, curbing yields along with dry weather in
 China  and  Germany .  “All of these weather events are coming together,” said
Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank International in
 London . “They’re making planting progress in the States, but
they’re still behind the five-year average and last year’s pace.
 Canada ’s planting is delayed and Russia’s is delayed. The EU is
still dry, especially in France, and there’s some dryness in
China.”  Corn for July delivery rose 6.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.27 a bushel by 10:55 a.m. London time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices are up 7.3 percent since trading ended on May 11
and yesterday climbed 3.3 percent, the most since April 29. The
grain more than doubled in the past year.  Early Harvesting  Wheat crops in the U.S. Great Plains are showing signs that
production may plunge more than the government forecast last
week as hot weather and a lack of rain erode plant quality and
force farmers to harvest early. As of May 15, U.S. winter wheat
was in the worst condition since 1996, with 44 percent of fields
rated poor or very poor by the government.  Wheat for July delivery gained 9 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$7.73 a bushel. The grain rose 3.7 percent yesterday, the most
since May 9, and jumped 65 percent in the past year on concerns
that adverse weather would affect harvests.  The USDA forecast on May 11 that the country’s production
of hard, red winter wheat would drop 25 percent to 762 million
bushels, the smallest amount since 2006.  Milling wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris rose 3.50 euros, or 1.5 percent, to 235 euros ($334.75) a
metric ton.  The worst drought in 50 years in the central Chinese
province of Hubei is slowing planting of spring crops and
limiting drinking water for half a million people, a local
government agency said. The region has had the least
precipitation on record since autumn, Hubei’s Department of
Water Resources  said .  Soybeans for July delivery climbed 3.5 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $13.445 a bushel in  Chicago , extending yesterday’s
1.1 percent gain, the biggest since April 29. The oilseed rose
43 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
