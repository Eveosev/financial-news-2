Violence used by Syrian, Yemeni and
Libyan leaders to curb pro-democracy protests is “shocking”
and has led to widespread human-rights violations, said  Navi Pillay , the United Nations high commissioner for human rights.  “People in the Middle East and North Africa are expressing
their aspirations of human rights that are taken for granted by
people elsewhere in the world,” she said in an interview in
Geneva. “The responses to these demands by the governments of
Libya, Yemen and  Syria  have been shocking. The information
emerging from all these countries leads me to believe human-
rights violations are taking place on a widespread basis.”  Pillay criticized Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s
government for snubbing calls to end a crackdown on protesters
that the UN says has claimed more than  850 lives . The
suppression of pro-democracy rallies that began in March
followed revolts that ousted longtime leaders in Egypt and
 Tunisia  and threaten governments in Libya, Yemen and Bahrain.  Syria has so far ignored requests to grant access for a
 Human Rights Council -mandated fact-finding mission. UN
investigators will probe alleged violations of international
humans-rights law in Syria even if they’re not allowed to enter
the country, Pillay said in the May 11 interview. The mission
will present a preliminary report in July and its full findings
in September.  “The Syrian authorities are acting in defiance of the
council  resolution  that asks them to stop the killings and have
immediate investigations,” she said. “These are matters of
grave concern. They have defied the very urgent calls made upon
them by the secretary general and the  Human Rights Council  to
stop the violence immediately.”  Sanctions  Though Assad initially agreed to permit a humanitarian
mission into Syria, he subsequently backtracked. The European
Union has imposed sanctions including a visa ban, an arms
embargo and an asset freeze on 13 Syrian officials and relatives
of the president. The U.S. has also applied sanctions against
three Syrian officials, including Assad’s brother and a cousin,
with more measures possible before Obama makes a major speech
tomorrow on the historic changes in the Middle East and the
implications for  U.S. foreign policy .  “We welcome the prospect of change to greater democracy in
this region,” Pillay said. “They are asking for civil and
political rights, the right to dignity, economic, social and
cultural rights and fundamental freedoms. We have a great role
to play in assisting the process.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
