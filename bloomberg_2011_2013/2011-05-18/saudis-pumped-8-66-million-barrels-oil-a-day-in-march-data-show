Saudi Arabia , the worldâ€™s largest
crude exporter, pumped 8.66 million barrels of oil a day in
March, down 4 percent from its output in the previous month,
official data showed.  The kingdom exported 6.54 million barrels a day in March,
for a monthly decrease of 6.5 percent, according to figures
posted on the Joint Organization Data Initiative website. The
initiative is supervised by the Riyadh-based  International
Energy Forum .  In February, Saudi Arabia produced 9.02 million barrels a
day and exported 7 million barrels a day, according to the data.
The figures for Saudi output in both months include condensate
