Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd. (SCBL) ,
the East African nation’s fourth-biggest lender by market value,
gained for a second day after it said first-quarter profit
climbed 14 percent as earnings from loans increased.  The shares added 1 shilling, or 0.4 percent, to 252
shillings by 10:27 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Net income grew to 1.64 billion shillings ($19 million) in
the three months through March, from 1.44 billion shillings a
year earlier, the Nairobi-based bank said in a statement e-
mailed by the city’s stock exchange yesterday. Net interest
income, the money banks earn from lending, increased 7.8 percent
to 2.21 billion shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
