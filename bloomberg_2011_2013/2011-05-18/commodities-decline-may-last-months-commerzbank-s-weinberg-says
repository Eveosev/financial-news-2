Commodity prices may fall for months
on weaker demand and lower market expectations before they
recover, Commerzbank AG analyst  Eugen Weinberg  said.  Commodities have dropped 10 percent this month, the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials shows.
Investors have tempered their optimism about the U.S. and world
economies and plan to put more money in cash and less in
commodities over the next six months, a Bloomberg survey found
last week. Thirty percent of the 1,263 investors, analysts and
traders asked said they would reduce commodity investments.  “We still have some weeks or even probably months to
complete the correction from too-high expectations,” Weinberg,
head of commodities research at Commerzbank, told Bloomberg
Television today in  London . “The demand situation especially
has changed to the negative recently.”  He cited lower U.S. construction activity, debt concerns in
 Europe  and some demand destruction in  Japan  and North Africa.
Commodities remain 40 percent higher than 12 months ago and
Weinberg said a return to a “bull run is still around the
corner.” That would be driven by constrained supplies for many
raw materials, including metals and agricultural goods, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
