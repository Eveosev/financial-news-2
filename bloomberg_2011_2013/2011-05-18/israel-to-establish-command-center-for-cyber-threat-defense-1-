The Israeli government will set up a
taskforce to develop its defense capabilities against possible
cyber attacks on critical computer systems, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said.  “We established today a national cyber command to
coordinate between the needs of national defense, the growth
potential of the cyber industries and the academic fields that
support both,” Netanyahu said at a press conference in
Jerusalem.  Israel  faces online threats from a number of different
sources including foreign countries and terrorist groups,
according to an e-mailed statement from the prime minister’s
office, citing one such attack in 2008 that disabled the Bank of
Israel’s  website . Israel will draw on academia, the private
sector and the security establishment to staff its cyber
taskforce, Netanyahu said.  Several Israeli technology companies including Checkpoint
Systems Inc. and  Verint Systems Inc. (VRNT)  are leaders in the field of
defending computers against hacker attacks and security
breaches. Israeli intelligence may have been involved in the
development of the Stuxnet virus that damaged computer systems
at Iranian nuclear facilities, according to analysts including
Frank Rieger, technology chief at GSMK, a maker of encrypted
mobile phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
