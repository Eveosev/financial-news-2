Oil traded near the highest in more
than a week in  New York  after a government report showed an
unexpected drop in U.S. crude inventories on increased refinery
operating rates and supply disruptions.  Futures were near $100 a barrel after climbing as much as
0.5 percent today. The Energy Department said stockpiles slipped
15,000 barrels last week to 370.3 million. Supplies were
projected to increase 1.7 million barrels, according to analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Refineries operated at 83.2 percent
of capacity, the most since the week ended April 1.  “The Department of Energy bucked analyst expectations  and
WTI reacted positively,”  Stephen Schork , president of the
Villanova, Pennsylvania-based Schork Group Inc., said in a note
to clients today. “However, the draw was well below the draw
seen in 2009 and 2008.”  Crude for June delivery was at $100.06 a barrel, down 4
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 2:36 p.m. Singapore time. It advanced $3.19 to $100.10
yesterday, the highest settlement since May 10. The more-
actively traded July future declined 6 cents to $100.50. Prices
are up 43 percent the past year.  Brent crude  for July settlement was at $112.53 a barrel, up
20 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday increased $2.31, or 2.1 percent, to $112.30,
the highest since May 13.  Imports Decline  Imports of crude dropped 4.4 percent to 8.57 million
barrels a day, the Energy Department report showed. Fuel imports
declined 14 percent to 2.26 million barrels a day, the lowest
since the week ended March 11.  Supplies of oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point
for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade, fell 1.59
million barrels to 40 million. TransCanada Corp.’s 591,000
barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline was shut from May 7 until May 13
after a leak in  North Dakota . It runs from Alberta to Cushing.  Gasoline inventories in the U.S. rose 119,000 barrels to
205.9 million in the week ended May 13. They were forecast to
increase 950,000 barrels, according to the median of 16 analyst
responses in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles of distillate
fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, slid 1.16
million barrels to 143.1 million, the lowest since April 2009.  Alberta Fires  Wildfires in northern  Alberta ,  Canada , shut a pipeline that
carries crude from oil-sands projects and may halt more than
55,000 barrels of daily output as companies run short of storage
space for their production.  Fires forced Plains All American Pipeline LP to stop
cleanup work from an earlier  oil spill  and shut down its Rainbow
pipeline system on May 15. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.,
Cenovus Energy Inc. and other producers have said they may
curtail output because of the pipeline disruption.  Canada was the biggest source of U.S. oil imports last
year, providing  1.97 million barrels  a day, according to the
Energy Department.  The most-actively traded oil option yesterday was the July
$90 put, giving investors the right to sell crude for delivery
that month at $90, which fell 43 percent to 85 cents. The
second-most active contract was the July $105 call, giving
investors the right to buy oil at that price.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 35.1 percent, down from 36.1 percent on
May 17. Open interest on oil futures was 1.58 million contracts,
the lowest level since April 27.  Home Sales  A report today may show sales of existing homes in the U.S.
slowed. Sales rose 2 percent, or an annualized 5.1 million, in
May, down from 3.7 percent growth in April, according to the
median estimate of 75 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  “People haven’t been so confident about a strong recovery
in the U.S., so the market is at a loss where to go,” said  Ken Hasegawa , a commodity-derivative sales manager at brokerage
Newedge Group in  Tokyo . “It’s possible for crude to close below
$100 a barrel this week. Oil is in the center of a range between
$95 and $105 a barrel.”  In  Louisiana , 16 gates are open on the Morganza spillway,
diverting the engorged Mississippi’s excess into the Atchafalaya
River basin. The opening of the spillway for the first time
since 1973 eased the threat of flooding for  Baton Rouge ,  New
Orleans  and a major petrochemical zone.  Offshore Drilling  A Republican proposal to expand offshore drilling was
blocked in the  U.S. Senate , a day after Democrats failed to
advance legislation that would repeal $21 billion in tax breaks
for five multinational  oil companies .  Supporters of the legislation fell 18 votes short of the 60
needed to advance, with five Republicans joining Democrats in
opposition. The tax repeal measure was eight votes short of the
required threshold on May 17.  Oil prices  advanced 9 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Tunisia and
 Egypt  and spread to  Libya .  Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday refused to
sign a Gulf Cooperation Council proposal to begin a transition
of power, objecting to the inclusion of some opposition members
in the deal, said Abdu al-Janadi, the deputy information
minister. Saleh’s decision came after the U.S. stepped up
pressure on the Yemeni leader to accept the plan as a step
toward ending protests against the regime.  The U.S. also imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and six other officials as his regime intensified its
two-month crackdown on protesters with coordinated attacks in
the suburbs of Damascus and on a city in the southern
governorate of Daraa, where the unrest began.  To contact the reporters on this story:
