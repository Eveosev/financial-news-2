Thailand ’s baht fell on concern
 Greece ’s debt problems will deter global funds from increasing
purchases of emerging-market assets.  The currency has dropped 1.2 percent this month as overseas
investors sold $100 million more Thai shares than they bought
during the period. European finance ministers this week floated
the idea of talks with bondholders over extending Greece’s debt-
repayment schedule.  “The risk environment is not all clear yet,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “The
uncertainty over Greece still has an overhang.”  The baht dropped 0.1 percent from the end of last week to
30.24 per dollar as of 4:04 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Thai financial markets re-opened today
after a two-day holiday.  Europe would consider “re-profiling” Greek bond
maturities as part of a package including stepped-up sales of
state assets and deeper spending cuts, Luxembourg Prime Minister
 Jean-Claude Juncker  said on May 16.  Thai bonds were little changed, with the yield on the 3.125
percent debt due December 2015 at 3.41 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was little changed at
3.173 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
