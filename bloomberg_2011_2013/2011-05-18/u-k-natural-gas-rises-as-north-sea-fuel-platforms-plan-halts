U.K. natural gas for next month rose
as BG Group Plc plans to halt its North Sea Armada oil and
natural-gas field for work and BP Plc said it would shut the
CATS riser platform.  BG will start to halt Armada on May 29 for 45 days while BP
will shut the CATS platform at the same time, spokespeople for
the two companies said yesterday.  Gas for next month gained 0.45 pence, or 0.8 percent, to
57.65 pence a therm, as of 4:30 p.m. in  London , according to
broker prices on Bloomberg. That’s equal to $9.31 a million
British thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  The two-phase  CATS  platform shutdown, likely to begin in
early June, will halt production from the Armada, Lomond,
Everest and Erskine fields. Each closure will last about a week,
with a week’s break in between.  CATS  stands for Central Area
Transmission System and has a capacity of 48 million cubic
meters of gas a day, or 12 percent of U.K. demand. There’s no
plan for a full closure this year of the CATS pipeline, which
would damp North Sea oil and condensate production.  National Grid forecast gas demand at 252 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m. London time tomorrow.
Pipelines in the country will contain 344 million cubic meters
of gas at that time, 4 million more than at the start of today.
The grid predicted a 13 million shortfall this morning.  Gas for today was little changed, slipping 0.1 percent to
57.95 pence a therm. The contract earlier rose as high as 58.75
pence as supply from the South Hook liquefied natural gas
terminal halted at about 11 a.m. Flows recovered to about 52
million cubic meters a day by 3:30 p.m. Daniel Schraibman, a
London-based spokesman for South Hook Gas Co., declined to
comment on the operations of the terminal.  U.K. baseload power for tomorrow was little changed,
dropping 10 pence to 50.40 pounds a megawatt-hour, broker data
on Bloomberg show. Power for delivery in the coming winter, the
six months from October, rose 0.4 percent to 57.55 pounds.
Baseload is delivered around the clock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
