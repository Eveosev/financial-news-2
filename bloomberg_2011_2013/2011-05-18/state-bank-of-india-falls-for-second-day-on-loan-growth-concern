(Corrects reporting period in third paragraph.)  State Bank of India (SBIN) , the nation’s
largest lender, fell for a second day after Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said loan growth may be restricted if the lender faces
a cash crunch.  The shares declined 1.7 percent to 2,373 rupees at 10:56
a.m. in Mumbai trading, heading for the third straight decline.  State Bank will have to be more selective on lending,
Chaudhuri said yesterday after the lender reported lower profit
for the fiscal fourth quarter. Loan growth will moderate by up
to 3 percent from last year’s levels, Chief Financial Officer
Diwakar Gupta told media in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata.  Declining capital may hamper attempts by Chaudhuri, who
took the helm at the state-owned bank last month, to grow the
balance sheet. The bank’s capital adequacy ratio under so-called
Basel II standards shrank to 11.98 percent during the quarter
from 13.39 percent a year earlier.  State Bank ’s stock rating was downgraded to “in line”
from “outperform” by Mahruk Adajania, an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc in Mumbai.  Net income dropped to 208.8 million rupees ($4.6 million)
for the three months ended March 31, from 18.7 billion rupees a
year earlier, the bank said in a filing to the Bombay Stock
Exchange yesterday. Loans climbed 20 percent to 7.72 trillion
rupees as of March 31, from 6.4 trillion rupees a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
