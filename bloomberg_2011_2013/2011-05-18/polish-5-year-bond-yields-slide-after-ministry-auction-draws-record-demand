Poland’s five-year bonds rallied
after record demand at an auction of the notes today.  The yield on bonds due in April 2016 fell nine basis points

3 billion zloty ($1.1 billion) of five-year bonds with
investors’ bids reaching 13 billion zloty, the highest level
since at least 1994, according to data on  Finance Ministry ’s
