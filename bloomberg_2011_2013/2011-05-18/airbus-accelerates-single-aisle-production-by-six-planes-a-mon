Airbus SAS said it will increase
production of its A320 series of single-aisle jetliners to 42 a
month by the end of 2012 in order to meet demand, equivalent to
72 more planes a year than at the current build rate.  Airbus will initially lift output from 36 aircraft a month
to 38 in August and then to 40 during the first quarter of next
year before reaching 42 in the final quarter, the Toulouse,
France-based company said today in a statement.  “With a backlog of over 2,300 A320-family aircraft to
deliver we need to increase production to accommodate continuing
strong demand,” said  Tom Williams , executive vice president for
aircraft programs. Airbus, the biggest commercial planemaker,
delivered 510 jetliners in 2010, 401 from the A320 family.  Single-aisle planes including the A320 and  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s
rival 737 are the workhorses of the  airline industry . The A320
is the main generator of revenue at Airbus, helping to finance
the new A350 widebody model, with a re-engined version offering
a 15 percent cut in fuel burn due to enter service in 2015.  Hans Peter Ring, chief financial officer of Airbus parent
European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co., said five days ago
that single-aisle output would move toward 40 jets a month by
next year and that a decision on a higher total was imminent.  By comparison, Airbus’s A330 widebody jets are made at a
rate of about 8.5 per month, increasing to nine in early 2012
and ten in the second quarter of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
