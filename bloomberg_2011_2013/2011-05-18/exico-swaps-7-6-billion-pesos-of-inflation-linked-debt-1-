Mexico   swapped  7.6 billion pesos
($648 million) of inflation-linked debt today, the third time
this year the government has exchanged bonds, the central bank
said on its website.  Holders handed over inflation-linked bonds due in December
2017 and June 2019 in exchange for debt due in December 2020,
the central bank said. On May 11, the government swapped 5.5
billion pesos of short-term bonds, about half of the 10 billion
pesos of notes it offered.  The government has exchanged 33.1 billion pesos of debt
this year, including todayâ€™s deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
