New World Resources Plc, the biggest
Czech coking-coal supplier, posted a first-quarter profit as an
improving economy spurred demand from steelmakers and utilities
and commodity prices rose.  Net income in the three months through March 31 of 3
million euros ($4.3 million) compared with a loss of 14.5
million euros in the year-earlier period, the Amsterdam-
registered company said today in a statement. That missed the 18
million-euro average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  NWR was forced to reduce coal production in the quarter by
6 percent as a result of more challenging underground
conditions, according to the statement. The companyâ€™s full-year
production and sales targets remain unchanged as the miner
expects to ramp up output of coking coal toward the end of the
year, it said.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose 42 percent to 82 million euros, below analyst
estimates of 89 million euros. Revenue increased 17 percent to
385 million euros.  NWR announced last month it negotiated a 35 percent
increase in contract prices for coking coal deliveries in the
second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
