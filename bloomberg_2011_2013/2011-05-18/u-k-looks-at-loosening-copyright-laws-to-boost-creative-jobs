U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
welcomed proposals to loosen copyright laws, saying they’d help
creative industries grow by making it easier to use material.  A report today by Ian Hargreaves, an academic at Cardiff
Business School, recommended the government set up a Digital
Copyright Exchange, where licenses to use material could be
traded, and make it easier to use “orphan works,” whose
authors can’t be traced.  Cable also welcomed proposals to make it legal to copy for
private purposes, including ripping music from compact discs,
something currently forbidden in the U.K.  “Such format-shifting is unlawful, though the  music
industry  has made it clear that it does not intend to act
against consumers who do it,” Cable said in a speech in  London 
today. “So the consequence of the ban on format-shifting is
simply to make it harder for a British entrepreneur to compete
with technology developed in the U.S. and other countries where
there’s no such ban.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
