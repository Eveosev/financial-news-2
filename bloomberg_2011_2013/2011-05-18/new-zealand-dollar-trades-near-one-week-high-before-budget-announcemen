The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars dropped against the dollar and yen as commodity prices
fell, damping demand for assets linked to growth.  The so-called kiwi earlier strengthened as New Zealand
Finance Minister Bill English said in the budget released today
that the operating surplus will be NZ$1.3 billion ($1.03
billion) in the year ended June 2015. Commodities slumped on
signs growth in the U.S. and elsewhere may be slowing.  “Aussie and Kiwi are somewhat hurt by the negative data
out of the U.S. this morning, so as you see investors pare back
appetite for higher-yielding investments, those two come under
pressure,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in Washington
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to 78.85 U.S. cents
as of 11:42 a.m. in  New York  from 78.91 cents yesterday, after
earlier rising as much 0.6 percent. The currency dropped 0.3
percent to 64.27 yen. Australia’s dollar lost 0.1 percent to
$1.0617, and traded at 86.57 yen from 86.82 yen.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
declined 1 percent to 340.26.  National Associated of Realtors said sales of existing U.S.
homes unexpectedly declined in April, dropping 0.8 percent to a
5.05 million annual pace.  Gross domestic product in  Japan  contracted an annualized
3.7 percent in the three months through March, following a
revised 3 percent drop in the previous quarter, the Cabinet
Office said today in  Tokyo .  English said the government would save NZ$5.2 billion over
four years to spend on rebuilding from earthquakes, and health
and education.  Standard & Poor’s , which has New Zealand’s AA+
sovereign rating on negative outlook, suggested today the rating
is secure as long as budget targets are met.  To contact the reporters on this story:
