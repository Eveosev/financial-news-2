Colombia  and Ecuador will cooperate
on a 138-megawatt geothermal project planned for their border as
both South American countries seek to diversify their power
output from hydroelectricity.  The Binacional Tufino-Chiles-Cerro Negro project will be
developed by Colombia’s state-controlled power company Isagen SA
and its Ecuadorian counterpart Celec SA, Ecuador’s Ministry of
Electricity and Renewable Energy said May 14 on its  website .  Both countries produced more than 60 percent of their
electricity from large hydroelectric facilities in 2008,
according to the International Energy Agency.  The companies will drill holes over a terrain of 5,000
hectares (12,400 acres) to gauge the site’s geothermal
resources, according to the statement.  Initial studies will cost $2.5 million, the ministry  said .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
