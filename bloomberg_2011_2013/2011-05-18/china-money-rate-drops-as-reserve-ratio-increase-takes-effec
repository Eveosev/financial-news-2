China ’s money-market rate declined
the most in almost three months on speculation a cash squeeze
will ease as banks comply with a central bank requirement today
to put more funds aside as reserves.  “Banks are relieved after they collected more than enough
money to make payments for the reserve-ratio hike,” said Chen Qiwei, a senior bond trader at Shenzhen Development Bank Co. in
Shanghai. “But traders are still worried about a possible
deterioration in inflation. The seven-day repurchase rate may
fluctuate around 4 percent in the short term.”  People’s Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the
nation will manage monetary conditions to curb prices, according
to an annual report dated April 18 and posted on its website
late yesterday. The central bank said on May 12 it would lift
banks’ reserve requirement by 50 basis points from today, the
fifth increase this year.  The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 138 basis points, or 1.38
percentage points, to 3.21 percent as of 10:16 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
the biggest decline since Feb. 24, according to a weighted
average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, were little changed at
3.46 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 dropped two basis points to 3.62 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
