The Sudanese army attacked a village
by air yesterday in the western region of Darfur, leaving
possible casualties, the  United Nations-African Union
peacekeeping mission  said today. It was the second air attack in
a week on areas of Darfur.  A peacekeeping team “will attempt to collect information
on possible casualties and newly displaced persons” resulting
from the air strike, which took place in the village of Sukamir
in North Darfur state, the mission, known as Unamid, said in an
e-mailed statement.  Unamid teams weren’t allowed to reach the Labado and
Esheraya areas of South Darfur state, where the army attacked by
air on May 15, leaving an unknown number of casualties,
according to the mission.  Citing “security threats,” the Sudanese government
restricted all movement of peacekeepers or aid workers in South
Darfur state beyond a 15-kilometer radius from Nyala, the state
capital, the mission said. Unamid flights were also suspended to
some locations in North Darfur, including Shangil Tobaya and
Fanga Suk, the mission said today.  Insurgents in Darfur took up arms in 2003, accusing the
government of neglecting the region. The conflict has led to the
deaths of as many as 300,000 people, mainly due to illness and
starvation, and forced about 2.7 million to flee their homes,
according to UN estimates. The Sudanese government has put the
death toll at about 10,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
