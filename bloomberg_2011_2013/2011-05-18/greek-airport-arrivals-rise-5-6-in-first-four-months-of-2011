Greek airports had a 5.6 percent
increase in international arrivals in the first four months of
2011 from the year-earlier period, according to data collected
from 13 airports by the  Association of Greek Tourism
Enterprises .  Passenger arrivals from abroad increased to 1.15 million in
the period through April 30, from 1.09 million in the same
period last year, the Athens-based association said in a
statement posted on its website. Airports on the popular holiday
islands of Kos, Rhodes and Zakinthos saw international arrivals
more than double, according to the statement.  Athens International Airport ,  Greece â€™s biggest, had a 4.9
percent drop in arrivals from abroad in the four-month period.
It was the only airport to mark a decline.  In April, international arrivals advanced 24 percent to
541,974. Data were collected from the 13 airports that comprise
about 95 percent of all arrivals from abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story
