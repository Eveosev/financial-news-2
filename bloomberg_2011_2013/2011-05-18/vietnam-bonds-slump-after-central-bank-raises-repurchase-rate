Vietnam ’s government bonds slumped,
pushing the three-year yield to the highest level in 30 months,
after the central bank raised borrowing costs for a second time
this month.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam lifted yesterday the repurchase
rate for the seven-day term to 15 percent from 14 percent,
according to an e-mail from the monetary regulator.  “The rate hike makes it more expensive for lenders to
raise funds and will result in increases of  interest rates  in
the market,” said Vu Anh Duc, an senior fixed-income dealer at
 Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Industry and Trade. (CTG)   The yield on the three-year bond rose 29 basis points, the
most since April 19, to 12.57 percent, according to a daily
fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was the
highest since Nov. 14, 2008. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  The yield on one-year notes added seven basis points to
12.34 percent and that on two-year debt climbed 22 basis points
to 12.64 percent.  Vietnam’s State Treasury will offer 1 trillion dong ($48.1
million) each of three- and five-year bonds on May 19, the Hanoi
Stock Exchange said in a statement on its website.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,785 per dollar as of 3:45
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,673, unchanged from
yesterday, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen; Editors: Ven Ram, Andrew Janes  To contact the reporter on this story:
