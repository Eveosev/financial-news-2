Asia  fuel oil  losses narrowed on
increased demand from Japanese utilities as nuclear power
capacity in the country fell. Gasoil profits dropped by the most
in a week, while naphtha margins declined.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 39 cents, or
4.9 percent, to $7.65 a barrel at 11:01 a.m. Singapore time,
according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and
refined-products broker. High-sulfur fuel oil swaps for June
fell $5.75, or 0.9 percent, to $634.75 a ton, PVM data showed.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
fuel oil rose $1 from May 16 to $12.50 a barrel. A wider spread
signals that less-viscous grades used for power generation fell
less than bunker fuel grades.  There was no oil trading on the Platts pricing system in
 Singapore  yesterday because of a public holiday.  Middle Distillates  June swaps for gasoil fell $1.50, or 1.2 percent, to
$122.75 a barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel swaps were at
$124.40 a barrel.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, fell 15 cents
to $1.65 a barrel. A narrower spread means it is less profitable
to make  aviation fuel  over diesel compared with a week earlier.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, dropped 22 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $17.45
a barrel, PVM data showed.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps for June fell $27.25, or 2.8 percent, to
$948.25 a ton, PVM data showed.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, dropped
to $114.24 a ton from $127.95 at the end of Asian trading May
16, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s naphtha inventories rose 164,283 kiloliters to 2.14
million kiloliters in the week to May 14, the Petroleum
Association of Japan said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
