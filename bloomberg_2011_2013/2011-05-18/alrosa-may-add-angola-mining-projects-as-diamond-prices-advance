     May 18 (Bloomberg) -- OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s diamond
monopoly, may add operations in Angola, where it already owns a
32.8 percent interest in the Catoca mining venture.  “All interesting concessions we have seen were considered
through the Catoca venture,” Alrosa’s Vice President Sergey Pushkin said yesterday in the country’s capital, Luanda. “This
does not mean that we will refuse to analyze a concession
especially for Alrosa.”  Alrosa and  De Beers , the two largest diamond producers, are
boosting output to benefit from prices pushed higher by rising
demand. Global prices of rough, or unpolished, diamonds jumped
26 percent last year, surpassing pre-recession highs, according
to data compiled by  WWW International Diamond Consultants Ltd .  “The crisis is completely over,” Pushkin said. Alrosa is
“very comfortable,” he said.  Alrosa, based in Siberia’s Yakutia region, has operated in
 Angola  since 1990. Its partners in the Catoca mine, near the
northeastern town of Saurimo, include the state-owned diamond
company, Endiama EP, Brazil’s Odebrecht SA and Israel’s Daumonty
Finance Co.  Last month, Alrosa said the Catoca venture was considering
seven more diamond concessions in Angola after posting net
income of $111 million last year. Catoca produced about 6.7
million carats of diamonds over the year and had sales of $527
million, the company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
