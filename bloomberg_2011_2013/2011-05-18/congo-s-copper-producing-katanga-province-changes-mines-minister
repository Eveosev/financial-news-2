The Democratic Republic of Congo’s
copper-rich Katanga province changed its mines minister, the
outgoing minister said.  The state’s former education minister, Therese Lukenge
Kapwibwe, will replace Juvenal Kitungwa Lugoma, who will now
serve as minister of infrastructure, Kitungwa said by phone
today from Lubumbashi, the provincial capital.  Congo holds 4 percent of global copper reserves and is
among the world’s largest producers of cobalt. Freeport McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc., Glencore International Plc and Vale SA all
have mining investments in the province.  China  has a $6 billion deal with the Central African
country that involves Chinese companies building infrastructure
in exchange for Congolese minerals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
