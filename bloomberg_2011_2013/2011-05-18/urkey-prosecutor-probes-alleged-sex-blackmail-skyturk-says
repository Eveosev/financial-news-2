Ankara’s chief prosecutor has opened
an investigation into the alleged blackmail of Nationalist
Action Party politicians using sex tapes,  Skyturk  reported.  The release on the internet of sex tapes by a group calling
itself Different Nationalists has led to the resignation of four
of the party’s politicians ahead of June 12 elections. The group
gave party leader Devlet Bahceli until this morning to resign,
saying it had tapes of at least six other party politicians it
would release.  The prosecutor opened an investigation into blackmail and
conditional threats at the request of the party’s lawyers,
Skyturk said. A spokeswoman at the prosecutor’s office had no
immediate information on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
