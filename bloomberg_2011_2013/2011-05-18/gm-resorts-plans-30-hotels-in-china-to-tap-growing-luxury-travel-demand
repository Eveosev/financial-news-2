MGM Resorts International (MGM) , the
biggest casino operator on the Las Vegas Strip, may open as many
as 30 hotels in  China  in the next three to four years to tap
increasing demand for luxury travel in the country.  MGM Hospitality , a unit of the company that focuses on
luxury hotels, is currently building 20 hotels in the Asia-
Pacific region, with nine of those in Chinese cities including
Shanghai and Ningbo, said Michael Sagild, managing director for
Asia-Pacific development at the unit.  Demand for luxury goods and travel in China may rise by as
much as 25 percent to account for 44 percent of the world’s
total by 2020, Credit Agricole’s CLSA said in a February report.
MGM Hospitality plans to open its first hotel in the country in
Sanya, Hainan Island, in the fourth quarter, Sagild said.  “If I had spoken to you nine months ago I would have said
we may get to about 15 hotels in China in the next three to four
years,” Sagild said in an interview in  Hong Kong , where he’s
based. “Today, it maybe 30 because in the last four months
there’s been an absolute rush on brands. There’s still a lot of
developers who’re interested” in opening hotels.  MGM Hospitality is expanding in  Asia  with projects in
cities including Kuala Lumpur,  Singapore  and Jakarta, where
“the growth in the wealth of some of the Indonesian families is
just absolutely phenomenal,” said Sagild.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
