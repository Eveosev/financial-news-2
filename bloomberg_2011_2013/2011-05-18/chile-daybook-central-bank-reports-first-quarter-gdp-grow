Chile ’s gross domestic product
probably grew 9.8 percent in the first quarter from the previous
year, according to the median estimate of 14 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The central bank is scheduled to release the data
at 8:30 a.m. New York time.  EQUITIES:
*The Ipsa index closed little changed at 4,852.96.
*E-CL SA fell 4.4 percent to 1,310.1 pesos, the most in four
months. Northern Chile’s largest power generator wasn’t included
in the semi-annual rebalancing of the MSCI Chile index. The
stock had gained on speculation it would enter the index.
*Enersis SA gained 1.2 percent to a four-month high of 203.71
pesos. The unit of  Spain ’s Endesa SA was rated “overweight” at
the brokerage unit of Banco de Credito e Inversiones.
*Salfacorp SA rose 2.2 percent to 1,821.2 pesos. Chile’s largest
engineering and construction company and Colombia’s Conconcreto
SA unveiled yesterday an agreement to pay $32 million for 80
percent of Panamanian builder Intercoastal Marine Inc.  MARKETS:
*Chile’s peso weakened for a third straight day as signs that
the  U.S. economy  is slowing eroded demand for riskier, emerging-
market assets. The peso fell 0.5 percent to 473.97 per dollar.
*Chile’s central bank paid an average of 473.68 for $50 million
as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the peso’s gains.
*The monetary authority sold 39.6 billion pesos ($83.5 million)
of five-year bonds at a yield of 6.19 percent and 22 billion
pesos of two-year notes at 6.02 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
