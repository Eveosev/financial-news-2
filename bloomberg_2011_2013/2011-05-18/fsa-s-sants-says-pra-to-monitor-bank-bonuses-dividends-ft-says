U.K. Financial Services Authority
Chief Executive Officer  Hector Sants  said British banks’ future
bonus and dividend payments will depend on their satisfying
regulators that the payments won’t weaken capital reserves or
erode sound risk management, the Financial Times reported,
citing an interview with Sants, who is to become head of the
planned  Prudential Regulatory Authority .  The assessments will be “part of the ongoing supervisory
process,” and “part of a dialogue, not a pass, fail process,”
Sants said, according to the FT.  Banks will also have to publish detailed information about
their assets that they so far only share with regulators, the FT
said, citing Sants. “We want to improve the ability of market
discipline to incentivize management to act responsibly,” Sants
said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
