Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  said comments made by
an  Intel Corp. (INTC)  executive yesterday about future version of its
Windows operating system were “factually inaccurate and
unfortunately misleading.”  Renee James, head of Intel’s software business, said
yesterday that Microsoft is planning multiple versions of the
next Windows, with four that work on technology from  ARM
Holdings Plc. (ARM)   Microsoft didn’t specify what about Intel’s remarks wasn’t
correct. Mark Martin, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, yesterday declined to comment when he was asked to
respond to Intel’s statements.  “We have been clear about our goals and have emphasized
that we are at the technology demonstration stage,” Microsoft
said in an e-mailed statement. “As such, we have no further
details or information at this time.”  Intel isn’t commenting further on the matter, said Suzy
Ramirez, a spokeswoman for the  Santa Clara , California-based
company today.  James said yesterday that the version designed for Intel
chips will run older Windows programs. The ARM versions won’t
run older programs, she said. They will be tailored to mobile
devices and tablet computers and there will also be a version
for Intel chips to address that market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
