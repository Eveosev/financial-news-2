Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the Texas-
based oil and gas explorer, is progressing to three dimensional
seismic surveying off the coast of  Kenya  after “encouraging”
2-D seismic testing in five offshore blocks.  “In 2-D we looked for indicators of hydrocarbons, and they
were there,” Brian Frost, a geophysical advisor at the company,
said today in an interview from Nairobi, the East African
nation’s capital. “We’ve contracted to shoot 3-Ds.”  Anadarko has the right to explore for oil and gas in five
Lamu Basin blocks off Kenya’s northeast shore, known as L5, L7,
L11A, L11B and L12, an area covering 30,500 square kilometres.  The explorer has the largest 70 percent stake in the
project, while partners  Cove Energy Plc (COV) , and Dynamic Global
Advisors Kenya Ltd., a unit of Dynamic Energy Exploration and
Production Corp, hold 15 percent each, Cove said in a statement
on July 28.  Kenya hasn’t discovered oil or gas yet. Neighboring
Tanzania produces gas from two deposits for local power
generation and  Uganda  is expected to start oil production later
this year or next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
