Carbon dioxide permits under the
European Union cap-and-trade system fell to their lowest price
in almost two months as regulators prepared to sell phase-three
allowances for the first time as early as this year.  The EU Climate Change Committee may vote in mid-June on a
plan that could ready sales late this year for the phase
starting in 2013 and running through 2020, the European
Commission said.  EU permits for December dropped as much as 1.2 percent to
16.44 euros ($23.44) a metric ton and were at 16.57 euros on
 London ’s ICE Futures Europe at 9:36 a.m. local time. They closed
yesterday at 16.64 euros a ton, below the 50 percent retracement
of the three-day jump through March 16, which is a technical
sell signal based on Fibonacci charts.  “It’s a mix between the technicals and the EIB news,”
said Dennis Mignon, a trader with First Climate in Bad Vilbel,
 Germany . “I expect to hold here,” he said today by phone.
Fibonacci charts are based on the theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.  Carbon prices probably will rise over the next several
weeks as utilities, which have shortages of allowances for 2013
and beyond, are forced to hedge forward-power sales, Mignon
said. “In the end, they will start hedging,” he said. “It may
be a bit late this year.”  The discount of United Nations emission credits to EU
allowances narrowed as much as 4 percent to its smallest spread
since April 26 as the U.K. said it may buy credits to help meet
greenhouse-gas targets through 2027.  Offset Discount Narrows  The discount of UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December narrowed as much as 16 cents to 3.85 euros a metric ton
on ICE and was at 4 euros as of 9:31 a.m. Buyers may have
purchased “in anticipation” of potential government
purchasing, Mignon said.  British Energy Secretary  Chris Huhne , acknowledging his
goals to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 50 percent by 2027
from 1990 levels were “ambitious,” said yesterday he’d detail
by the end of this year proposals to soften the blow on energy-
intensive industries. He said the intention is to make the cuts
through domestic efforts while declining to rule out using
greenhouse-gas-offset credits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
