Twitter Inc. , the micro-blogging
service, added tools that give users more control over how data
is shared with third-party applications.  The company will provide more detailed information on
privacy options for letting outside software makers read posts
and update profiles,  Twitter  said on its blog today.
Applications with access to users’ direct messages will need to
verify previously granted permissions. Applications that don’t
require that information will lose access by the end of the
month.  “We’re announcing an update to help you make more informed
choices about the way third-party apps integrate with your
Twitter account,” San Francisco-based Twitter said its blog.
“We’ve been preparing these changes in response to requests
from users and developers who asked for a greater level of
clarity and control.”  Twitter is boosting its privacy controls as technology
companies come under growing scrutiny about how they get users’
data or enable others to do so. The Senate Commerce Committee
tomorrow will hold a hearing tomorrow with Twitter rival
Facebook Inc., along with  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) , to answer
questions about data collection and usage on mobile devices.  There are hundreds of thousands of third-party applications
that aim to enhance Twitter’s features, such as automatically
sharing Tweets on other services or connecting players on game
platforms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
