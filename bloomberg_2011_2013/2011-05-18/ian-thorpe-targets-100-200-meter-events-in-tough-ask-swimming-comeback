Ian Thorpe said he’s targeting the
100-meter and 200-meter freestyle events as  Australia ’s most
successful Olympian builds his swimming comeback toward the 2012
London Games.  Thorpe, who announced his return to competition in February
after quitting in 2006, said he dropped the 400-meter
discipline, in which he won two Olympic gold medals, because he
doesn’t have enough time to prepare properly.  “I’m definite on what I will be swimming,” Thorpe, 28,
told reporters in Sydney today. “It’s 100 and 200 freestyle and
I’m preparing for both of those now. Already with what I’m doing
in the time frame that I have, it’s a tough ask.”  Thorpe last raced at a major meet at the 2004 Olympics in
 Athens , where he won two golds, one silver and one bronze to
lift his Olympic medal tally to nine, an Australian record. He
also captured 11 world championship titles.  He isn’t eligible to compete again until his name has been
on the sport’s drug-testing register for nine months, meaning
his competitive return is likely to be at a November  World Cup 
meet in  Singapore .  Thorpe said he was “satisfied” with his progress after
recently completing 10 days of high-altitude training in St.
Moritz,  Switzerland . He’s been working with Gennadi Touretski,
the Russian coach who guided Alex Popov to the 50-meter and 100-
meter freestyle gold medals at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.  “I look a little bit more like a swimmer now,” Thorpe
said. “I’m content where I’m at but I have a lot to do.
Satisfied doesn’t mean I’m there, by no means.”  The 100-meter times set at April’s Australian Swimming
Championships, which doubled as selection trials for July’s
World Championships in  Shanghai , highlighted the challenge
ahead, Thorpe said.  “I looked at the trials we had here in the 100 meters and
there were fantastic results,” he said. “I will have to swim
at my best just to make that relay team, simple as that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
