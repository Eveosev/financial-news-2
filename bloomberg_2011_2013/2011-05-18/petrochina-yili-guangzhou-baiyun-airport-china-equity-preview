Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
as of 3 p.m. close.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 13.20 points, or 0.5 percent, to
2,859.57. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 0.6 percent to 3,120.64.  Harbin Gloria Pharmaceuticals Co. (002437 CH) slumped 8.8
percent to 23.81 yuan, the lowest since its listing in June. The
China Securities Regulatory Commission’s Heilongjiang bureau

incomplete as it didn’t account for how funds from a share sale
were used, Harbin Gloria said in a statement yesterday.  Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial (600887)  Group Co. (600887 CH),
China’s biggest dairy producer by sales, slumped 6.7 percent to
35.24 yuan, the mist since February 2009. The company said it
plans to raise as much as 7 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in a
private placement of 218 million new shares for at least 32.67
yuan each, using the proceeds to increase production. The stock
resumed trading after being suspended over the past five days.  Wuhan Kaidi Electric Power Co. (000939 CH) gained 1.5
percent to 24.30 yuan after its board approved a plan to sell up
to 1.18 billion yuan of bonds with maturities of no less than
five years. The proceeds for bond sales will be used to
replenish working capital and pay down debt, it said.  ZTE Corp. (000063)  (000063 CH), China’s second-biggest phone-
equipment maker, added 1.6 percent to 27.28 yuan after saying it
demonstrated its first cloud-computing operating system.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
