SacOil Holding Ltd. (SCL) , the South
Africa-based oil and gas explorer, said it will announce an
“enhancement” to its internal management team within about a
week aimed at helping the company grow on the continent.  SacOil also expects its share price to “come back,” based
on the company’s fundmanetals, Chief Executive Officer Robin
Vela said at a conference today in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.  “When are assets are being evaluated, the reports start
coming out, then there will be a sense of the target value of
our share price,” Vela said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
