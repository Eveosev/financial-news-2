 Worcester returned to English
rugby’s Premiership and confirmed Leeds’ relegation by winning
its RFU Championship playoff against the Cornish Pirates.  Worcester won 25-20 at its Sixways Stadium last night to
complete a 46-32 victory over two games and go straight back
into the top flight after one season away. The Warriors won 30
of their 31 matches in the second-tier this campaign.  “We will go into next season on a high,” Warriors coach
 Richard Hill  told the  BBC . “Good luck to Leeds coming down into
this league. There are some tough teams.”   Leeds, which finished last in the Premiership standings,
would have stayed up had the Pirates won the playoff because the
Cornish club doesn’t meet the elite league’s entry criteria.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
