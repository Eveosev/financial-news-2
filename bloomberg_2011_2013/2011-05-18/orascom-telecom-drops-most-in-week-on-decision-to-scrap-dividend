Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  fell the
most in almost two weeks after the shareholders of North
Africa’s biggest mobile-network operator approved the
management’s decision not to distribute a dividend for 2010.  The shares lost 1.4 percent, the most since May 5, to 4.17
Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, giving the
company a market value of 21.9 billion pounds ($3.7 billion).  The Cairo-based company didn’t distribute a dividend for
2009, according to Bloomberg records.  To contact the reporter on this story:
