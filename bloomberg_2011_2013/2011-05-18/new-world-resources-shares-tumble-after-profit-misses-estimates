New World Resources Plc dropped to a
four-day low after the biggest Czech coking-coal supplier
reported a first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  The stock slid 1 percent to 280.1 koruna at 4:24 p.m. in
Prague, its lowest close since May 12. In  London , NWR ended the
day unchanged after earlier tumbling as much as 2.5 percent.  Net income in the three months ended March 31 was 3 million
euros ($4.3 million) compared with a loss of 14.5 million euros
a year earlier, the Amsterdam-registered company said today.
That missed the 21.5 million-euro average estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The first-quarter results were short of the street’s
expectations,”  Jan Tomanik , an analyst at Wood & Co. brokerage
in Prague, wrote in a report today. “The market may again be
worried about NWR’s ability to meet its production goals.”  Coal production fell an annual 6 percent in the quarter
because of “challenging” underground conditions that made more
profitable coking coal harder to reach, the company said in the
statement. NWR said its full-year production and sales targets
remain unchanged as the miner expects to boost coking coal
output toward the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
