South Africa’s ruling  African
National Congress  is likely to retain control of four of the
country’s eight major urban areas, be forced into coalitions in
three others and lose to the Democratic Alliance in another in
today’s  municipal elections , an opinion poll shows.  The ANC will probably lose in Cape Town and have to enter
into alliances to govern Pretoria,  Port Elizabeth  and Durban,
survey company Ipsos Markinor said in an e-mailed statement
today. The ruling party is set to win in East London,
Bloemfontein, Johannesburg and the area known as Ekhuruleni that
lies between Johannesburg and Pretoria, it said.  The margin of error in municipal poll surveys “is
considerably higher than that of the national results,” said
 Ipsos (IPSOF) , which based its findings on a survey of 2,050 likely
voters interviewed over the past month. “These results should
be regarded and used with caution.”  The Democratic Alliance has headed a coalition that runs
Cape Town, the second largest city, since the last municipal
election in 2006, while the ANC has controlled the seven other
biggest cities. Today’s vote ends at 7 p.m. and final results
are expected to be released within three days.  “The larger than normal undecided vote may, however,
influence the party’s winning margin in KwaZulu-Natal, Free
State, North West and Gauteng,” the company said. “Although
people in the Western Cape who are certain about who they will
vote for should push the DA’s support to over 50 percent, a
quarter of the voters is still undecided and may deliver a
surprise.”  Survey of political preference of 2,050 likely voters in
