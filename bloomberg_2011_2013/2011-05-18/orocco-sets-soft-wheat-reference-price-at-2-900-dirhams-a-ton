Morocco , North Africa’s third-largest
wheat importer, set the reference price for buying locally grown
soft wheat at 290 dirhams ($36.56) per 100 kilograms (220
pounds).  The reference price is valid from June 1 to Oct. 15 for
standard quality wheat harvested in 2011 for delivery at the
flour mill, the government said in a document dated May 16 and
published on the website of national grains office ONICL.  Morocco typically sets an import tax for soft wheat as of
June 1 to help local farmers sell their crop to the country’s
millers, before lifting or lowering the duties later in the
season as local stocks run out. The country on average produced
58 percent of the wheat it consumed in the past 10 years, based
on data from the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  The government seeks to “safeguard the revenue of the
farmers,” the document said.  Wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade for delivery in July
trades at the equivalent of $284.58 a metric ton, while
November-delivery milling wheat on NYSE Liffe in Paris is at the
equivalent of $336.52 a ton.  Millers will receive a subsidy of 30 dirhams per 100
kilograms from June 1 to Oct. 15 for locally bought soft wheat,
the grains office said.  Starting Oct. 16 and until May 31, the price wheat-storage
companies can charge millers will drop to 260 dirhams per 100
kilograms for wheat produced in Morocco, ONICL said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
