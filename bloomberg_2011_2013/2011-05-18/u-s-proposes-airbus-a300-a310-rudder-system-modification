U.S. operators of the Airbus SAS A300
and A310 jetliners must modify rudder-control systems within
four years to prevent excessive movements of a tail-fin part
that caused an American Airlines crash in  New York  in 2001, the
 Federal Aviation Administration  said in a proposal.  The announcement, which would affect 215 planes in the
U.S., is due to be published in the Federal Register tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
