The French consul general in  New York 
visited International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn
in a police precinct and later at the city’s Rikers Island jail
complex, a consulate spokeswoman said.  The visit by the official is standard practice when a
French citizen is arrested in the U.S., Marie-Laure Charrier,
the spokeswoman, said today in an interview. Strauss-Kahn is
charged with sexual assault and attempted rape in an alleged
attack on a maid at a Manhattan hotel. Benjamin Brafman, his
lawyer, said he denies the charges and will plead not guilty.  Philippe Lalliot, the consul general, went to see Strauss-
Kahn to make sure he’s being “correctly treated” and receiving
proper food, clothes and medications, Charrier said.  The consul general hasn’t discussed any legal issues
surrounding Strauss-Kahn’s arrest or imprisonment, nor offered
help regarding bail, Charrier said.  “There is no interference in the judicial process
itself,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
