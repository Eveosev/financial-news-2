China  International United Petroleum
& Chemical Corp., the nation’s biggest oil trader, will extend a
halt on imports and exports of diesel next month, a company
official said.  Unipec, as China International is known, didn’t import or
export any cargoes this month, said the official, who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential.  The state oil trader has scrapped exports since March after
some refineries cut production to reduce refining losses.
China’s government last week suspended diesel exports to most
countries to bolster domestic supplies before the peak summer
demand period.  Unipec has suspended imports since December. Demand for is
increasing as domestic manufacturers turn to diesel-fueled
generators after local governments rationed electricity amid the
worst power shortage in seven years.  Inventories of the fuel fell 12 percent to 10.21 million
metric tons in March from a month earlier, the first decline
since October, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data
released by the official Xinhua News Agency.  Unipec is the trading division of  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028) , or Sinopec, the nation’s largest oil refiner.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Jane, Ching Shen Lee, Alexander
