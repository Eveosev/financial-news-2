Wharf Holdings Ltd. (4) , a Hong Kong-
based property developer, plans to raise about HK$6.2 billion
($797 million) from a sale of convertible bonds, according to an
announcement to the city’s stock exchange today.  The three-year notes will convert into stock of the company
at HK$90 per share, according to the statement. Assuming full
conversion, that translates to 69.11 million shares, or about
2.28 percent of the current issued share capital, the statement
said. The securities pay interest of 2.3 percent a year, the
document said.  Wharf, which owns two of  Hong Kong ’s  largest malls  and the
city’s cable TV operator, has sold convertible notes once before
when it issued $402 million of 5 percent securities in 1993,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company, a
subsidiary of Wheelock and Co., reported in March a 1 percent
increase in 2010 net income after a one-time gain from the sale
of a property in Beijing inflated the previous year’s earnings.  The HK$90 a share conversion price represents a 65 percent
premium over the HK$54.55 closing price of Wharf’s shares
yesterday, according to the statement. Wharf’s stock has fallen
7.8 percent this year compared with a 0.14 percent decline in
Hong Kong’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Proceeds from the sale will be used to refinance the
group’s property investments in Hong Kong and mainland  China ,
and for general corporate purposes, the statement said. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. will help manage the sale, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
