The Olympic torch will travel on a
70-day, 8,000-mile (12,872-kilometer) relay throughout the U.K.
ahead of the 2012 London Games, organizers said.  The route will cover every nation and region in the U.K.
and includes six island visits, the London Organizing Committee
of the Olympic and Paralympic Games said today in a statement.  The relay will start May 19, 2012, at the southwest tip of
the U.K. at Landâ€™s End in Cornwall, a day after the Olympic
flame arrives from  Greece . It will reach the Olympic Stadium on
July 27 to light the cauldron at the opening ceremony.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
