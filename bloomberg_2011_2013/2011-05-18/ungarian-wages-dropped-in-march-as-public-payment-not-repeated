Hungarian wages dropped in March for
the first time in three months because a one-time payment to
lower-income state workers a year ago wasn’t repeated.  The average monthly gross wage declined 1.4 percent from a
year earlier to 217,061 forint ($1,156), the Budapest-based
 statistics office  said in a statement today. The median estimate
of five economists in a Bloomberg survey was for wage growth of
1.7 percent.  Public wages plunged 15.9 percent and private salaries rose
4.6 percent. Regular private wages excluding bonuses, one of the
 central bank’s  closely watched indicators for determining
inflation expectations, rose an annual 4.3 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
