European oil stocks, among the worst
performers since the equity-market rally began in 2009, are
trading at a 29 percent discount to the price of  Brent crude , a
sign to load up on the shares, according to  Societe Generale  SA.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how energy shares on the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index have lagged the rally in Brent crude during
2011. The Stoxx 600 Oil & Gas Index has climbed 5.6 percent in
the past 12 months, while Brent has soared 49 percent.  “Even if oil drops, the oil sector can still grow,” said
Daniel Fermon, an analyst at Societe Generale in Paris who
advises buying oil stocks. The brokerage recommended the trade
as one of its best ideas for May and June.  European stocks have declined since their peak for this
year on Feb. 17 as a selloff in commodities and concern that the
euro-area’s debt crisis will derail the economic recovery
overshadowed better-than-estimated company profits. Oil and gas
shares are the third worst performers of 19 industry groups on
the gauge since March 2009. Only telecommunications and utility
shares have performed worse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
