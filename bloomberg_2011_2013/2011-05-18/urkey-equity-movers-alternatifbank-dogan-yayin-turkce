Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell for a second day, dropping 329.87, or 0.5 percent, to
65,055.51 by the 12:30 p.m. break in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Alternatifbank AS (ALNTF)   jumped the most since October,
adding 15 kurus, or 10 percent, to 1.63 liras. The bank signed
an agreement with 25 banks to get a $235 million, one-year loan
at a total cost of 170 basis points over the benchmark, it said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Dogan Yayin Holding AS (DYHOL)  , Turkey’s biggest media
group, rose 2 kurus, or 1.4 percent, to 1.49 liras after saying
back-taxes and fines were cut to 859.5 million liras ($544
million) from 3.3 billion liras under the government’s debt
restructuring program. The company and its units will pay an
additional 81.2 million liras by raising their tax bases,
bringing the total payment to 940.7 million liras under the
program, the company said in a statement.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI),  Turkey ’s
largest cell phone operator by subscribers, fell 12 kurus, or
1.3 percent, to 9 liras. Mehmet Emin Karamehmet, whose Cukurova
Holding controls Turkcell and is embroiled in a management
dispute with other owners, may sell assets to pay about 1.7
billion liras in back taxes and fines. Turkish tax authorities
in the past week ordered the “precautionary seizure” of about
1.7 billion liras of Cukurova’s Turkcell assets against the tax
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
