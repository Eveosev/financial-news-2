Tourists visiting  Kenya  rose 15
percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, buoyed by the
global economic recovery, the  Ministry of Tourism  said.  International arrivals rose to 313,691, the Nairobi-based
ministry said in an e-mailed statement today.  “The increased investment confidence, improved economy and
security as well as growth in international flights have
effectively helped to increase arrivals,” the Tourism Ministry
said, according to the statement.  Kenya, whose largest single market for visitors is the
U.K., is hoping that its connection to the royal wedding will
boost tourist numbers.  Prince William  proposed to  Kate Middleton 
on holiday in Kenya last year. The couple married in London’s
Westminster Abbey on April 29.  The East African nation attracted a record 1.1 million
holidaymakers from abroad last year, up 15 percent from the year
before, while earnings jumped 18 percent to 73.7 billion
shillings ($847 million), Tourism Minister Najib Balala said on
March 7.  Piracy off the east coast of  Africa  has scared off cruise
tourism, the statement said. Only 558  cruise ships  docked in
Kenya last year, down from 12,096 a year earlier. The industry
is starting to rebound with growth of 15 percent to 586 cruise-
liner arrivals in the first quarter, compared with the same
period a year earlier, the statement said.  Kenya, the home of wild game parks including the Maasai
Mara in the country’s southwest and Indian Ocean beaches, is on
track to reach its target of 3 million visitors by 2015,
Planning Minister Wycliffe Oparanya said yesterday. Tourism is a
“key” generator of foreign exchange for the country, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
