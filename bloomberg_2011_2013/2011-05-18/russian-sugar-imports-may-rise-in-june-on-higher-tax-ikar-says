Raw-sugar deliveries to Russian ports
are seen rising to 500,000 metric tons in June, 25 percent
higher than initial forecasts, as buyers aim to avoid a
potential tax increase in July, the  Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies , or Ikar, said today.  The raw-sugar import tax may increase 70 percent to $85 a
ton in July, if the average price for the sweetener’s July
contract on the  New York  exchange drops below 22 cents a pound
in May, Yevgeny Ivanov, an analyst at the Moscow-based
researcher, said by phone today. “This will activate sugar
imports’ growth in June,” he said.  Under a joint agreement with Belarus and  Kazakhstan , Russia
taxes the imports based on monthly prices in New York trading,
with a one-month lag before changes take place. Raw sugar for
the July-delivery contract on ICE Futures U.S. in New York
averaged 23.96 cents in April and 21.51 cents so far this month.  Imported raw-sugar unloaded in Russian ports is expected to
be at least 2.2 million tons in 2010-11 compared with 2 million
tons in 2009-10, Ivanov said.  The country could produce up to 4.2 million tons of sugar
out of domestic beets in 2011-12, Ivanov said. Russian sugar
consumption is estimated at 5.5 million tons in 2011.  Russia  is expected to have a good beet-sowing area and
yield this year compared with 2010, when the worst drought in at
least 50 years hit most beet-growing areas in the country,
Ivanov said. The season starts in August and ends in July.  Russia planted 97 percent of its  sugar beet  sowing target,
or 1.16 million hectares (2.9 million acres), as of the end of
last week, he said. That’s 10 percent more than last year, he
said, citing  Agriculture Ministry  and Sugar Producers’ Union
data.  The country’s sugar-beet output dropped to 2.7 million tons
in 2010 from 3.3 million tons a year earlier, according to
Russia’s Federal Statistics Service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
