Cocoa shipments from  Cameroon ’s main
port of Douala climbed 8.2 percent in the week to May 16,
according to statistics from the harbor.  Exports totalled 460 metric tons, compared with 425 tons a
week earlier, according to information sent by SMS from the port
today. It didn’t provide reasons for the increase.  The average export price declined to 1,299 CFA francs
($2.82) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) from 1,310 francs a week
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations using rates
published by the country’s Cocoa and Coffee Board.  Prices climbed to 1,215 francs from 1,210 francs in the
South West, one of Cameroon’s main production areas, Abong
Abraham, president of the Ekona Farmers’ Cooperative, said in a
phone interview today.  Farmers sold the beans at 1,210 francs in the Littoral, and
in the Center and at 1,200 CFA in the South production zone,
according to information e-mailed from the Cocoa and Coffee
Information Relay Centers in Bafia, Bertoua, Nkongsamba and
Ebolowa.  Cameroon, the world’s fifth-biggest producer of the crop
after  Ivory Coast , Ghana,  Indonesia  and  Nigeria , produced
198,000 tons of the chocolate ingredients in the 2009-10 season,
compared with 205,000 tons a year earlier, the National Cocoa
and Coffee Board said in August.  The cocoa season in the Central African nation runs from
Aug. 1 through July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
