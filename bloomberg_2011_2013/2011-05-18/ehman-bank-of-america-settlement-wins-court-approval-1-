A bankruptcy judge approved a
settlement between  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  and  Bank of
America Corp. (BAC)  today. Bank of America, previously ordered by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck to pay Lehman $500 million plus
interest, said it would settle a remaining dispute by paying
bankrupt Lehman $1.5 million, according to a court filing today.  Bank of America has said it will appeal Peck’s final ruling
on the case.  The case is one of several involving big banks such as
Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. that Peck has been
considering as Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in
U.S. history in September 2008, sues to recover money to pay
creditors. Bank of America, a lender to Lehman as it foundered
in 2008, said it took the $500 million to offset loans to Lehman
and didn’t do so “maliciously.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
