New Zealand ’s dollar rose for a
second day as Asian stocks gained and reports showed producer
prices and  consumer confidence  in the nation increased.  New Zealand’s currency also advanced versus most of its 16
major counterparts on speculation minutes of the Federal
Reserve’s April meeting released today will show policy makers
intend to keep U.S. interest rates near zero to spur growth.
Australia’s dollar fell against the yen after Moody’s Investors
Service cut its ratings on the country’s four biggest banks.  “Economies in Asia look solid, while America’s economy
seems a bit soft amid mixed data,” said  Marito Ueda , senior
managing director in Tokyo at FX Prime Corp., a foreign-exchange
margin company. “The Fed may reconfirm its stance to maintain
rates at low levels” and that should help commodity currencies.  New Zealand’s dollar climbed to 78.73 U.S. cents as of
11:22 a.m. in  New York  from 78.49 cents yesterday, when it
gained 0.7 percent. The currency rose 0.5 percent to 63.918 yen.
Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0601 from $1.0627, after earlier
advancing 0.4 percent, and fell 0.2 percent to 86.36 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares gained 1.1 percent,
snapping a four-day decline.  The so-called kiwi was boosted as  Statistics New Zealand 
said producer input prices gained 2.2 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three months, and output prices
advanced 1.7 percent.  The ANZ-Roy Morgan consumer confidence index climbed to
103.2 from 101.4 in April, ANZ National Bank Ltd. said in an e-
mailed statement. A number greater than 100 shows optimists
outnumber pessimists.  Australia ’s dollar erased earlier gains versus the
greenback after Moody’s downgraded its long-term, senior
unsecured debt ratings of Australia & New Zealand Banking Corp.,
the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and
Westpac Banking Corp. to Aa2 from Aa1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
