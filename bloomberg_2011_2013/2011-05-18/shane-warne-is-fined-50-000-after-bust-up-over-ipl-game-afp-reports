Australian bowler Shane Warne was
fined $50,000 for his part in a row with an administrator after
a game in cricket’s Indian Premier League, Agence France-Presse
reported.                  Warne, captain of the Rajasthan Royals, was involved in an
“angry exchange” with Sanjay Dixit, secretary of the Rajasthan
state cricket association, after his team’s home defeat to Royal
Challengers Bangalore last week, AFP said.  The Board of Control for Cricket in  India  said a
disciplinary commission regarded the public criticism of Mr.
Dixit as being a “serious breach by Mr. Warne of his IPL
playing contract.” The commission also recognized that Warne
had apologized to Dixit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
