Prostate cancer screening beginning
from ages 44 to 50 may rule out the risk of dying in half of
men, according to a study that showed some men may need as few
as three screening tests in a lifetime.  The research, which analyzed blood samples donated in the
1970s by 12,090 Swedish men, showed that 44 percent of prostate
cancer deaths in the ensuing years occurred in 10 percent of men
with the highest levels of PSA, a protein associated with
prostate cancer at high levels. The study may help reduce
unnecessary tests and treatment, said the researchers at
 Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center .  Screening for prostate cancer has been the subject of
controversy for years as the disease is slow growing in most
men. In 2009,  a European study  of 182,000 men found that 48 men
were diagnosed and treated for each prostate cancer death
prevented. Prostate cancer treatment can cause impotence,
incontinence and other side effects.  “Everyone agrees there is too much overdiagnosis and
overtreatment of small, early prostate cancer now,” study co-
author Peter Scardino, chairman of surgery at Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said in a telephone
interview. Focusing most screening on men at higher risk based
on initial PSA results “could conservatively eliminate half the
men who are getting screened unnecessarily.”  The study looked at Swedish men ages 44 to 50 who gave
blood samples starting in 1974 before PSA testing become common.
Almost 5,000 of the men gave repeat blood samples six years
later from ages 51 to 55, and a third group of 1,167 men gave
blood samples at age 60. It will be presented at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month in  Chicago  and
was released yesterday in summary form.  New Screening Guide  Researchers said a test that shows below median levels of
PSA before age 50 may not rule out the risk of advanced cancer
years later. By age 60, however, men who had below median PSA
levels were unlikely to ever get metastatic prostate cancer,
according to the study. The findings suggest that results of a
man’s first PSA test can be used to guide screening in the
future. Men with very high PSA levels on the initial test should
be screened every year, Scardino said.  An estimated 217,730 new cases of  prostate cancer  were
diagnosed in the U.S. in 2010 and the disease will kill about
32,000 patients, according to the  National Cancer Institute .  While recommendations vary, the  American Cancer Society 
suggests that men with an average risk of prostate cancer start
discussing the matter with their doctors at age 50. Men often
get tests for PSA, or prostate-specific antigen, about every
year, said Scardino. PSA levels vary over time and can be
elevated because of inflammation, prostate enlargement, and
other benign causes.  Fewer Tests  Based on the study findings, men ages 44 to 50 whose
initial PSA screens show low levels of the protein wouldn’t need
another test for five years. If PSA level remain low, men could
get their final test at 60.  A PSA reading below the median level for that age suggests
no more PSA tests are needed, because they “are unlikely to
have any problems in terms of quality or length of life from
prostate cancer,” said lead author Hans Lilja, a clinical
chemist at  Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center . A man may
need no more than three PSA tests in a lifetime, researchers
said.  Each PSA test costs about $50, according to Otis Brawley,
chief medical officer of the  American Cancer Society .  “If this approach works, it’s going to decrease the
needless treatment,” Brawley said. “This is early promising
news.” Still, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering study results need
to be confirmed and replicated in other groups of men, he said.  The strategy “makes a lot of sense,” said Gerald Andriole, chief of urologic surgery at the Washington University
School of Medicine in  St. Louis . “It says: Let’s not waste our
time and money screening men with very low PSAs because all we
are going to do is create a lot of anxiety and a lot of biopsies
and find some cancers that are not likely to kill them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
