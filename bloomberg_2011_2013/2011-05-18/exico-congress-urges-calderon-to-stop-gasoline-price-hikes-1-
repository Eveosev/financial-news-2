     May 18 (Bloomberg) - Mexican lawmakers urged today
President Felipe Calderon to stop monthly increases in gasoline
and diesel prices during the rest of the year, saying they will
cause a crisis in the agricultural and industrial sectors.  Congress’s permanent committee, which meets when the full
body is out of session, approved the non-binding declaration in
a vote in  Mexico  City.  Mexico’s Finance Ministry increased local unleaded gasoline
prices 2.7 percent in the first quarter after boosting them 12.7
percent in 2010, while crude oil surged 34 percent in New York
trading over that time. The Finance Ministry sets prices on
gasoline sold by state-controlled  Petroleos Mexicanos , which
supplies all filling stations in the country.  The government may spend more than 100 billion pesos ($8.52
billion) on fuel subsidies this year, Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero said April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
