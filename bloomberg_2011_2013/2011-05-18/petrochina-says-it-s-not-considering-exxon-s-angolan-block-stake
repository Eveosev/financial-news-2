PetroChina Co. is not considering
buying  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s stake in an oil block in Angola,
 Jiang Jiemin , chairman of PetroChina, said at a briefing in
Beijing today.  China National Petroleum Corp., PetroChina’s parent, can
meet its overseas output target without making more
acquisitions, Jiang also said. The company targets 400 million
million metric tons oil equivalent of oil and gas output by
2015, of which half would be overseas, said Jiang, who is also
president of CNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
