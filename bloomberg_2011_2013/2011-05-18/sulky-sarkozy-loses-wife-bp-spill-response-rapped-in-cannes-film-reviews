French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  was
satirized in a movie that premiered at the  Cannes Film Festival 
yesterday, appearing on screen as a restlessly ambitious
politician who wins the election and loses his second wife.  “La Conquete” (“The Conquest”) starts with a message
that it is inspired by real characters yet remains “a work of
fiction.” We then see a close-up of the president-elect in 2007
sulking in his bathrobe and fiddling with his wedding band as he
watches TV reports of his triumph.  Out now in French cinemas, the somewhat empathetic movie
comes amid reports that Sarkozy’s third wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy
is pregnant. Sarkozy may also face no opposition from potential
presidential candidate  Dominique Strauss-Kahn , currently
imprisoned in  New York . A poll by Ifop for  Journal du Dimanche 
put the president’s popularity at 28 percent, a record low.  Sarkozy is played by  Denis Podalydes , who told reporters at
a Cannes news conference that he met the president two months
ago, after writing him a letter.  “He dismissed the movie right away, and said he wouldn’t
see it, just as he never reads books about himself,” said
Podalydes, who in real life is balding and bearded, not dark-
haired and clean-shaven as on screen. “He said he had no reason
to see it, especially since it focuses on his private life.”  “The Conquest” portrays Sarkozy as a politician who
describes himself as a Ferrari. He craves votes and coverage as
much as he does his wife’s advice and affection.  Jogging, Chocolate  The fidgety campaigner is seen jogging and cycling in full
view of the TV cameras, chomping on chocolates, and confronting
foes who call him a “premature gesticulator” behind his back.
When a blue-collar worker buttonholes him on one factory visit,
he chastises his advisers for letting the man get close.  Meanwhile, his exasperated wife Cecilia is slipping through
his fingers, much to his dismay. We see the solitary Sarkozy
charming female reporters on the campaign trail.  Xavier Durringer’s film is based on real facts and scripted
by Patrick Rotman, who has made documentaries about former
Presidents  Jacques Chirac  and Francois Mitterrand.  ‘Big Fix’  The festival also served as a platform for the documentary
“The Big Fix,” directed by Josh and Rebecca Tickell and
featuring Peter Fonda.  It argues that the Gulf of Mexico -- which in April 2010
suffered the worst  oil spill  in U.S. history with the explosion
of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Deepwater Horizon rig -- is neither clean nor safe,
and local people haven’t been properly compensated.  The movie zooms out to include the global financial
meltdown, the accident at  Japan ’s Fukushima nuclear plant and
even recent rebellions in the Middle East. The premise is that
the world is experiencing an ecological and economic crisis
because of corporations’ stranglehold on government.  The documentary sets out to show the lethal effects of the
oil spill on shrimp, dolphins and crabs as well as on the
livelihoods of fishermen.  A dispersant used to control the slick, according to the
documentary, has sparked health problems in humans, including
Tickell’s wife. The film criticizes the administration of U.S.
President  Barack Obama  for saying the disaster is under control.  “The issue that we have is that  Louisiana  is not cleaned
up,” said Tickell in an interview after his festival briefing,
“that from our knowledge dispersants were sprayed till the end
of last year, maybe even the beginning of this year, and that
there are sick and potentially mortally wounded people around
the Gulf region whose grievances have not been addressed.”  “If you’re going to redress the issue,” he said, “you
have to address the fact that the oil isn’t gone, dispersants
have damaged the ecosystem and they’ve damaged people.”  The BP oil disaster killed 11 workers, injured 17, and
spewed crude for 87 days into the  Gulf of Mexico . Tickell said
BP’s response wasn’t included because the company would not talk
to them, though he was happy to speak to it now.  “We don’t need oil,” Fonda said at the news conference.
He became interested in the film out of concern for marine
mammals, whales and porpoises, Fonda said.  The 64th Cannes Film Festival runs through May 22.
