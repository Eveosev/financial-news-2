Ermenegildo Zegna, the century-old
Italian maker of men’s suits, plans to open more stores in
 Brazil  to take advantage of rising luxury-goods demand despite
taxes that can make its products almost twice as expensive.  “Brazil has a great potential, it’s a place we’re devoting
a lot of attention,” Chairman Paolo Zegna said in an interview
yesterday in  Sao Paulo . The company will consider possible
locations outside the principal cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de
Janeiro and Brasilia, where Zegna already has stores, he said.
Zegna will study options during this year and the next.  Import duties in Latin America’s largest economy can raise
the brand’s prices by 45 percent, and for every Brazilian buying
its products in Brazil, there are six others who instead make
their purchases abroad in places such as Miami and  New York ,
Zegna said.  Chief Executive Officer Ermenegildo Zegna said in October
sales will grow 20 percent this year, as the company opens at
least 20 new stores -- half of which will be in China. Brazil’s
economy grew 7.5 percent last year, the fastest growth since the
1980s. Growth will be at 4.5 percent this year, according to
estimates by the  Finance Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
