The discount of United Nations
emission credits to European Union allowances narrowed 4 percent
to its smallest spread since April 26 as the U.K. said it may
buy credits to help meet greenhouse-gas targets.  The discount of UN Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December narrowed 16 cents to 3.85 euros a metric ton on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange in London as of 8:10 a.m.  EU permits dropped as much as 1.2 percent to 16.44 euros a
ton, the lowest level since March 25, before rebounding to 16.56
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
