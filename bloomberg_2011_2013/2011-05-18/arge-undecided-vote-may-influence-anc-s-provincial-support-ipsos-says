The larger than normal undecided vote
may “influence” the margin of support for  South Africa ’s
ruling African National Congress party in six of nine provinces
in today’s municipal elections, Ipsos Markinor, a survey
company, said in an e-mailed statement.  The ANC’s winning margin may be affected in KwaZulu-Natal,
Free State, North West and Gauteng, the company said. In the
Northern Cape the undecided vote will have a “big influence”
on ANC support while the undecided voters may “deliver a
surpise” in the Western Cape, where the ANC is expected to lose
to the Democratic Alliance, Ipsos said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
