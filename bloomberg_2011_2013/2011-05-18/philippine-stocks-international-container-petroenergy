Shares of the following companies may
had unusual moves in Philippine trading. Stock symbols are in

4,303.31.  Alaska Milk Corp. (AMC)  , owner of the No. 1 Philippine
milk brand, fell 2.3 percent to 13 pesos, the most since April
13. The company forecast profit will drop this year due to
higher costs and weak sales, BusinessWorld reported, citing

in his office for comment.  International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICT)  ,
the Philippines’ biggest port operator, slumped from a record,
retreating 10 percent to 50.75 pesos in Manila. The stock’s
sharpest loss since May 2009 came after MSCI Inc. said the
shares will not be added to its Philippine index.  Yesterday, the stock surged 13 percent to 56.40 pesos, the
highest close based on prices going back to March 1992, after
MSCI said the stock will be added to the MSCI  Philippines  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
