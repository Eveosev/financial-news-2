Mothercare Plc (MTC)  will shut more than a
quarter of its U.K. stores and expand overseas after full-year
profit fell 72 percent. The stock rose the most in two years.  The retailer of goods for mothers-to-be and children plans
to close about 110 shops in the U.K. and cut occupancy costs by
18 million pounds ($29 million) in two years, according to a
statement today. The restructuring will leave Mothercare with
170 outlets on town thoroughfares and 102 in out-of-town
centers, Chief Executive Officer Ben Gordon said.  “The high street is a less interesting place to be, we are
working hard to close our unprofitable stores,” Gordon said in
a phone interview. “It’s a relatively tough consumer
environment and its going to be challenging in the U.K.”  Mothercare, like other retailers such as Laura Ashley
Holdings Plc, has struggled as rising living costs, a slowing
economy and job uncertainty hurt  consumer spending . Increased
clearance in the fourth quarter lead to a 2.5 percent fall in
gross margins from the previous year, the company said today.  “Its recognized that’s it tough out there but it’s better
to do something than not to,”  Andrew Wade , an analyst with
Numis Securities Ltd., said by phone. “We are reassured by
management and the clear guidance they have given on their
strategy for the U.K. and the benefits of the store closures.”
Wade recommends buying the stock.  Mothercare shares rose 5.5 percent, the most since May
2009, to 448.50 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London trading.
The stock has dropped 27 percent this year, giving the company a
market value of 397.3 million pounds.  Income Decline  Net income for the 52 weeks ended March 26 fell to 6.5
million pounds, or 7.4 pence a share, from 23.6 million pounds,
or 27.3 pence, a year earlier, the company said. Sales grew 3.6
percent to 793.6 million pounds.  U.K. underlying profit from operations shrank to 11.1
million pounds from 36.1 million pounds the previous year. About
half of Mothercare’s sales come from the U.K., the CEO said.
International sales rose 16.3 percent and overseas sales may
grow as much as 20 percent this fiscal year as the company opens
150 new stores.  “The story is international and we expect international to
become a bigger component of our business in the years to
come,” Gordon said, “Our biggest growth is coming from  China ,
 India  and the Middle East.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
