Land Securities Group Plc (LAND) , the U.K.’s
largest real estate investment trust, said annual profit rose 14
percent as the value of company’s properties increased.  Net income for the 12 months ended March 31 climbed to 1.24
billion pounds ($2.02 billion), or 162 pence a share, from 1.09
billion, or 144 pence, a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts projected profit of about
979 million pounds, according to the average of four estimates
in a Bloomberg survey.  “Our markets are in recovery mode and we see particularly
strong growth prospects in London over the next few years,”
Chief Executive Officer Francis Salway said in the statement.
“We may continue to see ripples in prices, but we go into the
new financial year confident in our plans and well positioned to
address growth opportunities.”  Land Securities and other developers have revived office
projects in central  London  in the past year to take advantage of
a rebound in rents after most plans for new buildings were
shelved during the property recession. A total of 6.4 million
square-feet (595,000 square-meters) of space is currently being
built across 25 projects in central London, more than double six
months ago, Drivers Jonas Deloitte said May 3.  In January, Land Securities started work on a joint venture
with Canary Wharf Group Plc to build the Walkie-Talkie tower in
London, a project it shelved in 2008. The 37-story skyscraper in
the  City of London  will cost 500 million pounds ($791 million)
to develop and is scheduled to be completed in 2014.  Net asset value rose 20 percent to 826 pence a share. The
company increased its dividend by 0.7 percent to 28.2 pence a
share.  Asset Values  The value of Land Securities’ assets increased by 908.8
million pounds in the fiscal year, compared with a rise of 863.8
million pounds a year earlier.  Total property purchases in the year stood at 407 million
pounds at an average yield of 5.2 percent, the company said.
Property sales totaled 687 million pounds in the period.  The shares fell 6.5 pence, or less than a percent, to 747.5
pence in London trading yesterday, paring the gain so far this
year to 11 percent.  The company has also started work on a 230,000-square-foot
office complex in the Victoria district of west London, and has
won consent to construct a 75,000-square-foot office building in
Cannon Street that’s due to be completed in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
