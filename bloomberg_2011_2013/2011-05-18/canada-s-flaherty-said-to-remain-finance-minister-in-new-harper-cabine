Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  will remain at his post when Prime Minister Stephen Harper names his cabinet today, a government official said.  The official spoke on condition he not be identified
because the cabinet lineup hasn’t been made public. Harper, who
won federal elections on May 2, is due to announce his cabinet
in Ottawa at 11:15 a.m. New York time.  Harper will also appoint  John Baird  as foreign affairs
minister, the Globe and Mail said, citing people it didn’t
identify. Baird has served as environment minister among his
posts in previous Harper cabinets. Ed Fast will be named trade
minister, CTV News said.  The prime minister won a majority of seats in the House of
Commons in the election, ending seven years of minority
governments. Parliament will resume sitting on June 2, followed
by a speech from the throne the following day outlining the
government’s agenda. The federal budget will be released later
in June, Flaherty said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
