Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to an almost two-week low, as record payments on
 government securities  coming due today boosted liquidity.  The yield on the nation’s 9.25 percent bonds due May 2014
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.7 percent
at 2:48 p.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s the lowest level on a closing basis since May
6. The bond’s price rose 0.048 centavo to 106.702 centavos per
peso.  “Liquidity had been tight ahead of the payments,” said
German Verdugo, head bond trader at Bogota-based brokerage
Correval SA. “This should help normalize things and lead yields
to fall across the curve.”  Investors will receive 11.2 trillion pesos ($6.16 billion)
between May 16 and today as payment for securities coming due
today and interest on bonds due 2012, 2014 and 2017, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a  statement  yesterday.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said last month the
government would use funds it kept in the central bank to make
the record payments.  Most investors likely already bought securities
anticipating the payments, according to Verdugo.  Colombia’s borrowing costs fell at a government auction
today of inflation-linked peso bonds, known as TES UVR. The
yield on securities due February 2023 fell to 3.93 percent from
4.19 percent at the last auction on April 6. The government also
sold securities due May 2017 and February 2015 to yield 3.73 and
3.54 percent, respectively, according to a statement from the
Finance Ministry.  Peso Strengthens  The peso erased earlier declines, strengthening 0.5 percent
to 1,817.20 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,825.35 yesterday.  The Colombian currency has dropped 1 percent in the last
month, the second-worst performance after the Brazilian real
among six Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg, as
damped optimism about the U.S. economic recovery and concern
over the Greek debt crisis reduced demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  “Domestic elements and fundamentals will prevail, even
amidst a choppier external environment,”  Diego Donadio , a
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  Sao Paulo , wrote in a note to
clients today. “We are not affirming the Colombian peso is
immune to external jitters, but we are affirming the Colombian
peso is very much attractive.”  The peso’s “fair value” is likely 1,730, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
