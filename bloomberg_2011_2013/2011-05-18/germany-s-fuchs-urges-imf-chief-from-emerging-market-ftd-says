An emerging-market candidate should
head the International Monetary Fund,  Michael Fuchs , deputy
floor leader of  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s  Christian Democratic
Union , said,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported.  It may be easier for an IMF leader who isn’t from  Europe  to
implement a “return to a solid budget” in some European
countries affected by the debt crisis, the newspaper cited Fuchs
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
