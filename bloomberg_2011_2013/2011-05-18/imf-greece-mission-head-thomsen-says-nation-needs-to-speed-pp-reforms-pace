Greece  needs to quickly step up the
pace of reforms to its economy if the EU-led program isn’t to
run off track,  Poul Thomsen , head of the IMF’s Greek mission,
said.  “The Greek program has largely achieved what it set out to
do,” Thomsen said at a conference in Athens today. “It won’t
remain on track without reinvigoration of structural reforms.
Without this it will run off track.”  Thomsen said he expected the economy would shrink about 1
percent more than expected this year and that an acceleration of
structural reform in the public sector, among others, was needed
to keep the deficit down.  “Without this acceleration, the deficit won’t be much
below 10 percent in 2011,” he said. “There is no more low-
hanging fruit out there - all the low-hanging fruit is gone.
Difficult structural reforms are what lie ahead.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
