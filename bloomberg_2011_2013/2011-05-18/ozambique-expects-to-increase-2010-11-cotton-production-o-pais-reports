Mozambique expects to increase its
cotton production by 28,000 tons in the 2010/2011 farming season
compared with a season earlier, daily independent O Pais
reported, citing a document from the Instituto de Algod√£o de
Mocambique.  The southern African nation expects to produce 70,000 tons
of cotton this season, compared with 42,000 tons in the
2009/2010 farming season, the Maputo-based newspaper said.  In the last season 99 percent of the cotton was exported to
the Asian market, O Pais reported..  To contact the reporter on this story:
