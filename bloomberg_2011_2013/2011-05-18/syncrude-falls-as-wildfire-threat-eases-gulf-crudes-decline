Syncrude weakened for the first day
in three as crews made gains in controlling wildfires in
 Alberta , lowering the threat to large plants that produce the
synthetic crude.  Fires in northern Alberta forced crude producers to pare
output after Plains All American Pipeline LP was forced to close
a pipeline section. At Syncrude Canada Ltd., which is evacuating
nonessential personnel from its Aurora mine site because of
smoke, production continues with reduced staff.  “The facilities are not at risk,” said Alison Trollope, a
spokeswoman for Canadian Oil Sands Ltd., the which owns the
biggest stake in the Syncrude venture. Smoke from fires in the
region has raised concern about visibility and  air quality , she
said.  Syncrude’s premium versus benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed $1.25 to $13.50 a barrel at 2:27 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.
The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 25 cents to
$17.25 a barrel.  Plains said it shut the southern portion of its damaged
Rainbow pipeline in Alberta May 15. The top tier of the 220,000-
barrel-a-day line was already closed after a spill. That forced
producers dependent on the line to slow or shut production.  Cenovus Energy Inc. said it slowed production to 8,000
barrels a day from 22,000 barrels a day at Pelican Lake to allow
it to store oil while the line remains shut.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. said yesterday it can store
oil until today. It produces about 40,000 barrels a day at its
Pelican Lake site in northern Alberta.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI fell $1.10 to $13.90
a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet dropped 80 cents to $14.45 over
the benchmark.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
weakened 65 cents to $7.35 a barrel over WTI, and Poseidon’s
premium fell 65 cents to $7.55.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium slipped 15 cents to $6.10 a
barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium fell 60 cents to $12.65 a barrel
over WTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
