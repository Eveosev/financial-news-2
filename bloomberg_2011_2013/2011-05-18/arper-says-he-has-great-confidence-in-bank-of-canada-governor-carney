Canadian Prime Minister Stephen
Harper said today he did not want to comment on the legal issues
surrounding International Monetary Fund Managing Director
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn , and said he has “great confidence” in
Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney .  “Obviously the situation is very difficult,” Harper told
reporters in Ottawa after naming his cabinet. “We are
discussing with our partners at the IMF what the appropriate
steps are under the circumstances. I’m not going to comment on
the legal matters involving this particular individual.”  Asked if Carney would be a suitable replacement for
Strauss-Kahn, Harper said Carney is “doing a wonderful job as
Governor of the Bank of Canada. I have great confidence in
him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
