Japanese stocks rose by the most in
more than two weeks, led by lenders after a report that  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411)  will merge its banks and as the yen
weakened.  Mizuho,  Japan ’s third-biggest publicly traded lender,
gained 3.2 percent. Tokyo Electric Power Co. advanced 2.4
percent after the company announced a revised plan for
stabilizing its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear-power plant.
 Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723)  leapt 5.8 percent after the Nikkei
newspaper reported the chipmaker that supplies the country’s
carmakers will resume operations at a plant damaged by the March
11 quake.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1 percent to 9,662.08 at
the 3 p.m. close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix index
gained 1.1 percent to 837.96, with about six times as many
stocks advancing as falling. Both gauges had the largest
increase since May 2.  “The current level of the yen is giving a sense of ease in
the market and supporting stocks,” said Seiichiro Iwamoto, who
helps oversee about $35 billion in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Asset
Management Co. “The report about Renesas is positive, because
that means the issue of disrupted supply chains is going to be
resolved. Uncertainties are decreasing.”  The yen fell ahead of a report tomorrow forecast to show
Japan’s economy contracted in the first quarter. It depreciated
to 116.41 against the euro, the weakest level since May 11.
Against the dollar, Japan’s currency dropped to 81.59 from 81.40.
A lower yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  Banks Advance  Banks were the biggest contributor to the Topix’s gain
after the Nikkei newspaper reported Mizuho Financial Group will
merge its retail and corporate banks by 2013. Mizuho climbed 3.2
percent to 131 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s
largest bank by market value, rose 2.4 percent to 386 yen.
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , the second-biggest,
increased 3.5 percent to 2,464 yen.  The Topix has lost 10 percent since March 10, the day
before a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan’s
northeast coast, disabled a nuclear power plant and disrupted
supply chains at companies. Shares in the gauge traded at 0.94
times book value yesterday, the lowest level since April 19.  “Stocks are cheap in terms of valuations,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  Nuclear Plan  Tokyo Electric Power advanced for the first time in five
days, gaining 2.4 percent to 389 yen. The company said it
expects to cool reactors at its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant by as early as October, maintaining its earlier timetable
in an updated plan to resolve the worst nuclear crisis in 25
years.  One month after releasing its so-called road map to
stabilize the Fukushima plant, the company known as Tepco
outlined more detailed steps at achieving a cold shutdown, where
the core temperature in the three damaged reactors falls to
below 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit).  Renesas Electronics jumped 5.8 percent to 744 yen. The
company will start increasing its capacity to supply chip
products by 20 percent a month from June after it halted
production at a plant because of the March earthquake, the
Nikkei newspaper reported. It aims to restore supply to the pre-
earthquake level by the end of October, according to the report.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s largest energy exploration company,
climbed 3 percent to 553,000 yen. The operator of the proposed
Ichthys liquefied natural gas project in  Australia  said the
Northern Territory government has allowed the venture to proceed.  Inpex and  Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , Japan’s second-
biggest oil driller, were boosted by higher  oil prices . Crude
for June delivery rose as much as 1.1 percent today to $98 a
barrel in electronic trading in  New York . Japan Petroleum
increased 1.5 percent to 3,740 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
