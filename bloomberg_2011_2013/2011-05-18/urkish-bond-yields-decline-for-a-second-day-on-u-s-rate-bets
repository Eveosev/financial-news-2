Turkish bond yields fell for a second
day and the lira gained on speculation the U.S. will keep rates
low after disappointing economic data and before the  Federal
Reserve  releases minutes from its meeting last month.  Two-year benchmark bond yields slumped as much as eight
basis points to 8.74 percent and traded one basis point lower,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.81 percent at 12:01 p.m. in
Istanbul, according to the TEB Local Benchmark Bond Index. The
lira strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.5823 per dollar, rising for a
third day.  Housing starts and building permits fell in April and
industrial production unexpectedly stalled. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last month signaled the economy still
needs monetary support and the central bank will continue to
reinvest proceeds of maturing debt after ending its purchase
program.  “The bad U.S. data reinforced the expectation that the
Federal Reserve will start raising rates later and this is
supporting emerging markets,” said Cem Tozge, a  fund manager  at
Ata Yatirim Menkul Degerler AS.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of equities declined 0.4 percent
to 65,111.26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
