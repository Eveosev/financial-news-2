Air Force One carrying President
 Barack Obama  touched down safely after the pilot aborted the
landing on final approach into Bradley International Airport in
 New London , Connecticut this morning, a White House spokesman
said.  “The pilot was in the process of landing but due to
weather the pilot decided to circle around and then landed the
plane, this is a standard and safe procedure,” the spokesman,
Nick Shapiro, said in a statement.  Weather conditions at the time were overcast skies and
light fog, according to the airport’s website.  The plane, with Obama, his staff and members of the media
aboard, landed at 10:05 a.m. The president is delivering the
commencement speech at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy this
morning.  Last month a government plane carrying first lady  Michelle Obama  aborted a landing at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland
because it was too close to a military transport plane.  To contact the reporters on this story:
