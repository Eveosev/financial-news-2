Polish wage growth accelerated in
April to the fastest in 16 months as workers demanded pay
increases to compensate for inflation.  Average corporate wages rose 5.9 percent from a year
earlier, up from 4 percent in March, the  Central Statistical
Office  reported today in Warsaw. The median estimate of 21
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 4.7 percent. Wages fell 1
percent on the month.  The Narodowy Bank Polski in Warsaw raised the seven-day
interest rate to 4.25 percent from 4 percent on May 11, the
third increase since January, to curb consumer-price growth.
Inflation rose to a 2 ½-year high in April and workers at
companies such as  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , a copper producer with
31,000 employees, organized protests for a higher pay.  “With inflation as high as it is, employees may want to
push further for bigger salaries,” said  Maja Goettig , chief
economist at Bank BPH in Warsaw. “In real terms, wage growth is
still pretty moderate. But today’s data could be a red light for
the Monetary Policy Council. If this trend continues, it could
raise central bank concern about second-round effects.”  The inflation rate rose to 4.5 percent in April from 4.3
percent in March, exceeding the central bank’s 2.5 percent
target for a seventh month. Polish companies and households in
April expected inflation of 4 percent within the next 12 months,
down from a three-year high of 4.6 percent in March, according
to a central bank survey.  The zloty traded at 3.9201 per euro at 4:52 p.m. in Warsaw,
compared with 3.9254 before the data were announced.  Employment increased 3.9 percent from the same period last
year, down from 4.1 percent in March. The result was below the 4
percent median forecast by 19 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Employment rose 0.1 percent on the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
