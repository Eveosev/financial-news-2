Japan  will consider the use of smart
grid technologies as it forms a new energy policy following the
nuclear crisis in Fukushima prefecture, the government’s top
spokesman said.  “Japan will work on establishing a new energy system,
including the introduction of a smart grid,” Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said in a speech in Tokyo today, without
elaborating. A smart grid uses computerized meters to regulate
power use.  Prime Minister Naoto Kan said last week Japan will increase
renewable energy sources instead of relying on nuclear power in
its new energy plan after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
crippled the Tokyo Electric Power Co. Dai-Ichi plant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
