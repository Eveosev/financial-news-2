Yuan forwards strengthened for a
second day on speculation currency gains will be used to help
tame inflation.  The People’s Bank of  China  will focus on stabilizing
prices, Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said in an annual  report 
released late yesterday. Chinese officials agree the currency
should advance, though are split over what pace of gains would
be optimal, Deputy Finance Minister  Zhu Guangyao  said last week
in  Washington .  “Inflation remains a headache for China,” said Kenix Lai,
a foreign-exchange analyst at Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd. in
Hong Kong. “China has to continue with its gradual appreciation
for the currency to rein in rising prices.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.06 percent
to 6.3755 as of 4:40 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 2 percent premium to
the spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan closed at 6.5047 in  Shanghai , little changed from
6.5060 yesterday, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency has strengthened 1.3 percent this year and
reached 6.4892 on April 29, the strongest level since 1993. The
central bank set its  reference rate  0.05 percent higher at
6.5074. The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than 0.5 percent
either side of the daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, China’s currency slipped
0.03 percent to 6.4983 per dollar.  A stronger currency helps tame inflation by reducing the
cost of raw-material imports, though it also erodes the
competitiveness of the nation’s exports. Gradual appreciation is
a general trend, Yao Jian, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry
of Commerce, said yesterday.  Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a year
earlier following a 5.4 percent increase in March that was the
biggest since July 2008. The government aims to limit inflation
to 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
