Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S.
discount retailer, posted a 2.7 percent gain in first-quarter
profit that beat analysts’ projections, bolstered by the
credit-card business.  Net income in the period ended April 30 rose to $689
million, or 99 cents a share, the Minneapolis-based company said
today in a statement. That compared with the 94-cent average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The credit-card business performed better than expected,
helping to counter slower-than-anticipated sales in retail,
Chief Executive Officer Gregg Steinhafel said in the statement.
Sales also benefited from the appeal of Target’s REDcard rewards
program and its PFresh grocery sections.  “PFresh continues to gain traction,” Barclays Plc analyst
Robert Drbul said in a May 16 note. “The PFresh initiative at
Target is one of the largest transformational programs under
way."  Total revenue climbed 2.2 percent to $15.9 billion. A year
earlier, first-quarter profit was $671 million, or 90 cents a
share.  Target gained 47 cents to $51.25 in early trading after
closing at $50.78 yesterday on the  New York  Stock Exchange. The
shares had dropped 16 percent this year through yesterday
compared with a 3 percent gain for  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the
world’s largest retailer.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville,  Arkansas , said yesterday
that sales at U.S. stores open at least a year dropped for an
eighth straight quarter. Customers are making fewer trips to
stores because of the increase in fuel prices, U.S. stores chief
 Bill Simon  said.  Competitive Landscape  Target is vying with dollar stores, as well as Wal-Mart,
for cash-strapped customers. Confidence sank to a six-week low
last week, again because of escalating fuel costs, according to
the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter, short of analysts’ projections, after a 3.1
percent gain in the final quarter of 2010.  Steinhafel is looking beyond Target’s home turf to spur
sales growth, with plans to open 100 to 150 sites in  Canada  in
2013 and 2014. The expansion, the retailer’s first outside the
U.S., may eventually help push sales past $100 billion, Target
said in February. Wal-Mart entered Canada in 1994 and has more
than 300 stores there.  (Target will hold a call on the results at 10:30 a.m. New
York time. To listen, see www.target.com/investors.com.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
