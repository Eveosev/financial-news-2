Bank of Italy Deputy Director General
Ignazio Visco said defaults won’t solve  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis as they would shut nations out of the markets and signal
fiscal unreliability.  “Governments that default are excluded for potentially
long periods from international capital markets,” he said in a
speech in Brussels today, according to an e-mailed text from the
Rome-based central bank. “Most importantly, default also
signals an overall lack of reliability of the country.”  Visco echoed European Central Bank Executive Board members
 Juergen Stark  and Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who today ruled out a
Greek debt restructuring. European Union finance ministers for
the first time this week floated the idea of extending  Greece ’s
debt repayments as the nation struggles to meet the terms of
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($156 billion) rescue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
