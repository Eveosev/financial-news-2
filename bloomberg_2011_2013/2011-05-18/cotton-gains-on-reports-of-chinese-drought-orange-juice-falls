Cotton rose for the fourth straight
session on reports that  China ’s worst winter drought ever is
delaying planting in Hubei province, the country’s fifth-largest
producer. Orange juice declined.  Hubei had the least precipitation since autumn in more than
50 years, making it difficult to plant cotton, the local water
department said on its website. About 2.7 million acres (1.1
million hectares) of crops, including corn and rice, have been
affected, it said.  “The drought in China is a major issue, and the weather
there is keeping the market firm,” said Thomas Mikulski, a
senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .  Cotton futures for July delivery rose 4.82 cents, or 3.1
percent, to settle at $1.5986 a pound at 2:38 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The fiber has surged 11 percent in
four sessions.  Earlier, the price reached $1.608, the highest since April
27. Cotton has surged 94 percent in the past year on increased
demand from China, the world’s biggest importer.  Orange-juice  futures for July delivery declined 1.4 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $1.805 a pound on ICE. Yesterday, the
commodity reached $1.8605, the highest since April 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
