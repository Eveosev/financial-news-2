Hungarian lenders rejected the latest
draft of a government plan to help borrowers who canâ€™t meet
payments on foreign-currency mortgage loans,  Nepszabadsag 
reported, citing a Hungarian Banking Association decision.  Revisions to an earlier plan propose extending a special
tax on banks, originally planned for three years through 2012,
by another two years, the newspaper said.  Banks also would be required to keep bad loans on their
books for more than five years under the new plan, the newspaper
said.  The draft plan also proposed temporarily maximizing the
Swiss franc exchange rate on non-performing household mortgage
loans at 160 forint per franc, compared with 190 forint reported
earlier, with the difference in costs accumulating in a separate
account that would have to be repaid over the maturity of the
original loan, Nepszabadsag said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
