U.S. dairies are generating record
production as farmers seek to benefit from a rally in milk
prices that is boosting costs for shoppers at  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and eroding profit for Starbucks Corp.  Milk output totaled 16.662 billion pounds in April, up 1.5
percent from a year earlier, and the highest ever for the month,
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report.  Last
week, the agency forecast record domestic output through next
year.  Milk futures are up 24 percent this year in Chicago as
exports surged to Asia and domestic demand increased. The retail
price of dairy products will rise as much as 5.5 percent this
year, faster than overall food costs, the government has
 forecast . To profit from the increase, farmers are expanding
herds and boosting productivity per cow, USDA data show.  U.S. producers “have every incentive to keep producing and
expanding supplies whenever they can,” said Michael Swanson, a
Minneapolis-based economist at  Wells Fargo & Co ., the largest
U.S. agricultural lender. “With the weak dollar and growing
Asian demand, we can sell all this milk that we’re producing at
these prices or even better.”  In April, the dairy herd expanded to 9.186 million head, up
1.1 percent from a four-year low in December 2009, and the
highest since July 2009, USDA data show. On average, each cow
produced 1,814 pounds of milk in April. That’s down 1.9 percent
from 1,849 in March, which was the second-highest ever, after
the record of 1,869 in May 2010.  USDA Forecasts  On May 11, the USDA said production this year will jump to
an all-time high of 195.4 billion pounds (88.6 million metric
tons), up from last year’s record of 192.8 billion pounds.
Output will continue to increase into 2012 to 198.7 billion, the
department said. The U.S. is the world’s biggest fluid-milk
producer after  India .  Class III milk futures reached a 32-month high of $19.65
per 100 pounds on March 11 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Futures for May delivery gained 1 cent today to close at
$16.43.  Demand is growing as the economy recovers, said Michael Marsh, the chief executive officer of Western United Dairymen, a
Modesto, California-based trade group that represents about
1,000 dairy farmers in the state.  “We are starting to see some uptick,” Marsh said. “When
consumers have additional cash, they can afford to spend those
dollars at restaurants. Then, of course, more dairy products are
consumed.”  Exports Rising  Rising export demand for dairy products including dry-milk
powder and butter from buyers in  Asia  and  Mexico  also is fueling
the jumps in prices and production, said Bob Cropp, an economist
at the  University of Wisconsin  in Madison who has been studying
the industry since 1966.  Dairy-product shipments rose 38 percent to 1.609 million
tons in 2010 from a year earlier, and exports climbed 37 percent
in the first three months of 2011 to 430,519 tons, according to
the  USDA . Cheese exports last year jumped 62 percent to 38,794
tons, while butter exports doubled to 45,072 tons, data show.  The export gain “is keeping those prices very strong and
that benefits the farmers,” Cropp said. “However, it does
raise retail prices to the consumer,” which has hurt domestic
sales of fluid milk, he said.  Supermarket Prices  Whole milk at the supermarket averaged $3.597 a gallon (3.8
liters) in April, up 15 percent from a year earlier, according
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Average retail cheddar-cheese
prices rose 2.7 percent to $5.204 a pound last month, the
highest since at least January 1984, government statistics show.  While prices rose, there are signs that higher costs may
slow demand. U.S. sales of fluid-milk products fell in February
from the same month in 2010, USDA data show. Sales of reduced-
fat milk, or 2 percent, fell 2.9 percent in February 2011 from a
year earlier, government  data  show.  Still, grocers and restaurants are passing along higher
costs to customers. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the
world’s largest retailer, has raised prices on some grocery
items, particularly dairy and meat, Chief Financial Officer
Charles Holley said on a call with reporters yesterday. Seattle-
based Starbucks, the world’s largest coffee-shop operator, said
last month that full-year profit will be down 22 cents because
of higher fuel and dairy prices.  “Dairy is up,” Starbucks’ Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead said during a telephone interview last month. “Ongoing
exposure and just the inflationary impact in those commodities
will pressure us further,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
