Following is the text of
 Canada 's leading indicators report from  Statistics Canada .  The composite leading index rose 0.8% in April, after a
0.6% gain in March. Overall, 8 of the 10 components
increased in April, 2 more than the month before.  All three manufacturing components advanced, versus
only one the month before. New orders rebounded 0.5%. The
average workweek lengthened for the third time in four
months. The ratio of shipments to inventories rose, led by
stronger sales. Much of the gains in manufacturing
reflected stronger exports, and the leading indicator for
the  United States  (+0.7%) posted another solid increase.  The components related to household demand in Canada
were mixed. The housing index (-0.4%) posted its first
decline in six months, as starts slowed while sales
increased. Furniture and appliance sales rose 0.4%, but
sales of other durable goods fell 0.2%.  To contact the reporter on this story:
