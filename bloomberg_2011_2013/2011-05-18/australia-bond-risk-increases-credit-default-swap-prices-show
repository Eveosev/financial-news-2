The cost of protecting Australian
corporate bonds from default rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased half a basis
point to 107.5 basis points as of 11:02 a.m. in Sydney,
according to Credit Agricole CIB. The Markit iTraxx Asia index
of 50 investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  was little
changed at 107 basis points as of 9:02 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit
Agricole prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 119.5
as of 9:57 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
