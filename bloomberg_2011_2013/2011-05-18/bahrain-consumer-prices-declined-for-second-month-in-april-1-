Bahraini consumer prices fell 2.3
percent in April from the same month last year, the second
consecutive month of negative inflation, as housing costs
plunged.  Housing and utilities costs dropped 14.2 percent, while
food prices rose 0.4 percent, compared with 2.3 percent in
March, the  Central Informatics Organization said on its website
today . The index rose 0.4 percent from the previous month.  Bahrain declared martial law in March as it sought to quell
Shiite Muslim-led demonstrations calling for more democracy and
civil rights after popular uprisings ousted rulers in Egypt and
Tunisia earlier this year. Gulf monarchies, led by  Saudi Arabia ,
sent troops into Bahrain the same month to help the government
contain unrest.  Bahraini economic growth is expected to slow to 3.1 percent
this year from 4.1 percent in 2010, the International Monetary
Fund said on April 27. The fund forecast an annual inflation
rate of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
