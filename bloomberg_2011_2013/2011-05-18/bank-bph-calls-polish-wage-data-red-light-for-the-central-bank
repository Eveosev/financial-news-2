Maja Goettig, chief economist at Bank
BPH SA in Warsaw, comments on data showing Polish average gross
wages rose an annual 5.9 percent in April. The median estimate
of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 4.7 percent
increase.  “In real terms, wage growth is still pretty moderate. But
today’s data could still be a red light for the Monetary Policy
Council because if this trend continues, it could raise central
bank concerns about second-round effects.  “With inflation as high as it is, employees may want to
push more for bigger salaries.  “We expect the next rate hike in July, before the Monetary
Policy Council leaves for its summer break.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
