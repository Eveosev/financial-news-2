Grain imports into  Italy , the world’s
third-largest wheat buyer, rose 25 percent in this year’s first
two months on higher corn and barley purchases, the national
cereal-industry association said.  Inbound shipments gained to 2.22 million metric tons from
1.77 million tons a year earlier, the Rome-based Associazione
Nazionale Cerealisti, known as Anacer, said in an e-mailed
statement today. By value, imports jumped 60 percent to 613.6
million euros ($875 million).  Corn prices surged 88 percent in Chicago trading in the
year through February, increasing the bill for buyers such as
Italy. Imports of the grain into the country more than doubled
by value in the first two months of 2011 from a year earlier and
increased 53 percent by volume.  Deliveries of corn climbed to 516,853 tons in the period
from 336,870 tons a year earlier and rose to 101.7 million euros
from 47.5 million euros in value, according to Anacer. Barley
imports climbed 39 percent to 191,011 tons.  Inbound soft-wheat shipments rose 19 percent to 818,810
tons by volume and almost doubled in value to 206.9 million
euros from 105.2 million euros. Imports of durum wheat, the hard
variety used to make pasta, gained 17 percent to 365,611 tons.  Eight-Year High  Italians eat more wheat products such as bread and pasta as
part of their diet than the French, Germans, Americans or
British, according to  data  from the International Maize and
Wheat Improvement Center. Italy’s wheat imports rose to an
eight-year high in 2010 as domestic production fell.  Egypt and  Brazil  were the world’s two biggest wheat
importers in the marketing year through June 2010, according to
figures from the International Grains Council.  Including oilseed and protein-crop products, the value of
Italy’s two-month imports increased to 830.8 million euros from
553.4 million euros.  Italian cereal-industry exports amounted to 431.3 million
euros in January and February, Anacer said. That resulted in a
trade deficit of 399.5 million euros, more than double the 165
million-euro shortfall a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
