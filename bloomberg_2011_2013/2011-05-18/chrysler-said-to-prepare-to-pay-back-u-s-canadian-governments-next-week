Chrysler Group LLC plans to repay
U.S. and Canadian government loans on May 24, clearing the way
for  Fiat SpA (F)  to increase its ownership in the U.S. automaker,
two people familiar with the plans said.  Chrysler, based in  Auburn Hills , Michigan, is marketing as
much as $7.5 billion of debt to repay the U.S. Treasury and
Canadian governments for money loaned as part of its 2009
bankruptcy restructuring.  The automaker said last month it would repay the loans,
allowing Fiat to exercise an option to increase its stake to 46
percent from 30 percent. The new debt is expected to price
today, and three business days are planned to complete details
before the money changes hands, said one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the plans are private.  Eileen Wunderlich, a Chrysler spokeswoman, declined to
comment yesterday.  Chrysler is seeking a $2.5 billion  term loan , a $3.5
billion bond offering and a $1.5 billion line of credit, people
with knowledge of the plans have said.  Fiat, based in Turin, Italy, will start negotiations with
banks to expand its credit line to as much as 1.5 billion euros
($2.14 billion) after raising its stake in Chrysler, three
people familiar with the effort have said.  Fiat has said it will pay $1.27 billion to acquire the
additional 16 percent in Chrysler.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of both
automakers, has said he wants to increase Fiatâ€™s ownership in
Chrysler to 51 percent this year as he prepares to take the U.S.
company public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
