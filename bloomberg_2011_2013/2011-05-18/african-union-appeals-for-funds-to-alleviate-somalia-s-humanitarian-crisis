The African Union appealed to members
states and the international community for funds to alleviate a
humanitarian crisis in Somalia that has left 2.4 million people
living in “dire” conditions.  Of the $529 million requested this year to help alleviate 
the crisis, only a quarter has been secured so far, the Addis 
Ababa-based organization said in an e-mailed statement today. 
In Somalia, 241,000 children are “acutely malnourished,” the 
organization said.  “This is one of the highest rates in the world and double
the threshold of an emergency,” it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
