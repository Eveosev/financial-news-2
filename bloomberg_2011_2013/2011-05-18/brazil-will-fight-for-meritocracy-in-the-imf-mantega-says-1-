Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said he hopes that Dominique Strauss-Kahn remains in his
post as head of the  International Monetary Fund .  “I am perplexed by this situation and hope it clears up in
Dominique’s favor,” Mantega said in an interview broadcast on
Globo News TV tonight.  Strauss-Kahn, 62, is accused of attacking a housekeeper at
a midtown Manhattan hotel and forcing her to perform sex acts.
His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, denies the charges. Strauss-Kahn
was arrested May 14 and yesterday ordered held without bail.  Mantega also said that Strauss-Kahn was an ally of Brazil
in seeking reform of the selection process for IMF chiefs.  Brazil is committed to meritocracy in the IMF, Mantega said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
