Bernard L. Madoff’s wine and spirit
collection fetched $41,530 in an Internet sale at  Morrell & Co.
Fine Wine Auctions  today.  Despite unknown storage conditions, all 59 lots in the
Madoff group found buyers, with most exceeding their presale
estimates. The total, which doesn’t include the buyers’ premium
of 18 percent, almost tripled the presale forecast of $15,000.  It’s the latest sale of Madoff’s possessions seized by the
U.S. Marshals to raise money for the victims of his $65 billion
Ponzi scheme.  The top lot was a case of 1996 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
which fetched $6,800, more than doubling its low estimate of
$3,200. A case of 1996 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild last month
fetched about $8,200 at Sotheby’s in  London .  A crystal decanter filled with a mysterious brown liquid
soared past its estimate range of $60 to $90 to bring $950.  A case of Veuve Clicquot, yellow label brut, fetched
$1,500, above the $240 to $350 target. That $125 bottle price is
a 68 percent premium over the $40 charged at  New York ’s Chelsea
Wine Vault.  A bottle of 18-year-old Macallan Scotch Whisky  went for
$1,300, more than 10 times its presale target of $120 to $150.  Even a selection of minibar 2-ounce bottles of Smirnoff
vodka, Bombay Gin and Grand Marnier did well. Estimated at $10
to $20, the lot found a buyer at $300.  The earlier auctions of Madoff’s possessions brought bigger
bucks. His powerboats and a Mercedes-Benz fetched $1.1 million
in 2009. Last year, souvenir hunters helped raise $2 million
from the liquidation sale of Madoff’s bed and diamonds owned by
his wife, Ruth.  Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence in federal prison
after pleading guilty to his decades-long  Ponzi scheme  in 2009.  To contact the reporter of this story:
