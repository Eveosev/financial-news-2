Island Renewable Energy , a Dublin-
based wind and solar asset developer, is exploring options to
build a wind park in Bulgaria, said Nikolay Nikolov, the
executive director for southeast  Europe .  The company’s Bulgarian unit signed an agreement with the
Suhindol municipality in northern Bulgaria to do wind
measurements and a feasibility study, Nikolov said today in a
telephone interview. He declined to confirm an announcement by
Suhindol’s mayor, Plamen Chernev, reported by  Dnesbg.com  news
website on May 13, saying the project involves a 90-megawatt
wind farm valued at 130 million euros ($185 million).  “If we decide to go ahead with the project, construction
may start in some three years,” Nikolov said. The decision also
hinges on whether the government will change an "unfavorable"
 Renewable Energy  Sources law, Nikolov said.  The law, passed on April 21, requires wind farms and solar
parks to set their price for feeding power to the grid only
after construction is completed, making it harder to calculate
the break-even point during planning stages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
