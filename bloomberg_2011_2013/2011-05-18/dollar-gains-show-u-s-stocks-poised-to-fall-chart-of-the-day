U.S. stocks are more vulnerable to a
rising dollar than at any other time in the past four decades,
according to Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist at
 RBC Capital Markets .  The CHART OF THE DAY demonstrates the link by comparing the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index with the Dollar Index in the past 12
months. The latter is inverted to show that gains in stocks have
accompanied declines in the U.S. currency’s value.  Through the first four months of the year, the Dollar Index
dropped 7.7 percent. The indicator of the dollar’s value against
the currencies of six major U.S. trading partners ended April at
its low for the year. Since then, the index has risen as much as
3.9 percent.  “The dollar rally is a headwind” that may cause stocks to
drop in the next three months, Zyblock wrote today in a report.
By his reckoning, the so-called inverse correlation between the
currency’s value and shares is the strongest since 1971.  Disappointing economic reports also indicate share prices
are poised to fall, the report said. He cited a Citigroup Inc.
index that compares indicators with estimates for 10 of the
largest economies. The gauge fell last week to minus 23.7, its
lowest reading in two years.  Zyblock recommended that clients add to investments in
health care and consumer staples, such as food, beverages and
tobacco. He also suggested that they reduce holdings of energy
and raw-material producers, the “most susceptible to further
increases in the dollar and/or global economic growth scares.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
