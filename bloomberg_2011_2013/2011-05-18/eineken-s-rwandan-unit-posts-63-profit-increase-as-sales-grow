Heineken NV (HEIA) ’s Rwandan unit posted a
63 percent increase in full-year profit as sales jumped.  Net income advanced to 10.3 billion Rwandan francs ($17.2
million) in the 12 months through December from 6.35 billion
francs a year earlier, Brasseries et Limonaderies du Rwanda said
in an e-mailed statement today. Revenue grew 16 percent to 52.8
billion francs “supported by higher volumes and increased
pricing,” it said.  Profit was boosted by “strong top line growth and effective
cost management, supported by a favourable economic backdrop and
the consistent implementation of constructive government
policies,” the company said.  Bralirwa, as the company is known, began trading its shares
on the Rwandan Stock Exchange in January after holding the East
African nation’s first initial public offering. The stock
climbed 11 percent yesterday to 228 francs, according to the
bourse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
