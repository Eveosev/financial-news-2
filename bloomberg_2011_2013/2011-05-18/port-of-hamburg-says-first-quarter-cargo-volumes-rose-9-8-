The Port of Hamburg,  Germany ’s
largest harbor, said cargo turnover rose 9.8 percent in the
first quarter after trade with Asia and the countries around the
 Baltic Sea  increased.  Cargo volume handled totaled 31.4 million tons in the
period, the Port of Hamburg said in a  statement  today. The
number of standard containers handled rose 18.2 percent to 2.1
million, of which Asia accounted for 1.3 million boxes, it said.  Hamburg lost its  ranking  as Europe’s second-largest
container port to Antwerp in 2009 when the German port’s
container volumes slumped 28 percent. Traffic picked up last
year, with volumes rising 13 percent, as German exports jumped.
Hamburg said today it won European market share in the first
quarter as container volume growth outpaced a 10.1 percent
expansion in Rotterdam,  Europe ’s largest port, and a 7.9 percent
increase in Antwerp.  “The reasons for the above-average container volume growth
are remarkably strong container traffic to and from Asia as well
as in the Baltic Sea region,” the port said.  Hamburger Hafen & Logistik AG, which handles two-thirds of
containers at Hamburg, said on May 13 that first-quarter profit
jumped 47 percent to 16.4 million euros because of growth in
European exports to  China  and increasing traffic to Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
