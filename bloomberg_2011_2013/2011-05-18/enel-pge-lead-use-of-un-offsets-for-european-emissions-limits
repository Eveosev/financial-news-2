Enel SpA (ENEL)  and PGE SA handed in the
most United Nations carbon credits, including those that will be
banned from May 2013, to comply with 2010 European Union
emissions limits in the world’s largest cap-and trade program.  Rome-based Enel handed in 26.8 million UN offsets since
2008, according to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. The
company has a limit of 95.2 million over the five years through
2012. Poland’s PGE, the next-biggest user, submitted 13.7
million and has a cap of 23 million, the report shows.  European emitters can use cheaper offsets to comply with
pollution limits. Credits from projects linked to
hydrofluorocarbon and adipic acid processes will be banned from
use in the program from May 2013. The  greenhouse gases  released
from such projects can trap as much as 11,700 times more heat
per molecule than carbon dioxide. The European Commission said
the projects offer “exorbitant” return rates for investors and
undermine the market’s integrity.  “As the biggest emitter in the scheme, the power sector
has used the most credits over the last three years,” said
Gillian Boccara, a London-based analyst at New Energy Finance.
“Over the next two years, we expect EU ETS participants to
surrender all of the HFC and N2O adipic acid credits that they
purchase.”  EU Data  UN credits from the projects made up 78 percent of total
Certified Emission Reductions used to comply with 2010 emissions
limits, according to a breakdown on annual EU data published May
16 by the European Commission, regulator of the bloc’s cap-and-
trade program. Of all credits issued so far, 66 percent are of
this type.  Of the 117 million CERs used, 90.4 million were from
projects linked with hydrofluorocarbon and adipic acid. Some 393
million credits have been issued to date under the UN’s Clean
Development Mechanism from such projects, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The discount of UN credits to EU permits, traded as a
separate contract, shrank by 8 cents, or 2 percent, to 3.93
euros ($5.59) a metric ton as of 12:15 p.m. on  London ’s ICE
Futures  Europe . The gap was earlier as little as 3.85 euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
