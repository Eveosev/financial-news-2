Brazil ’s central bank will continue
to raise the benchmark interest rate to ensure consumer price
increases meet its target even though monthly inflation will
slow in coming months,  Valor Economico  reported, citing a
government official it didn’t identify.  The government expects the month-on-month inflation rate
will drop in the four months from May, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said. Still, it will be too early to declare victory,
given that year-on-year inflation will continue to accelerate
and is likely to peak in August, Valor cited the official as
saying.  The central bank estimates the fight against inflation will
slow annual economic growth to 4 percent or less in 2011 and
2012 from 7.5 percent last year, Valor reported.  A spokesman at the central bank, who can’t be identified
because of internal policy, declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
