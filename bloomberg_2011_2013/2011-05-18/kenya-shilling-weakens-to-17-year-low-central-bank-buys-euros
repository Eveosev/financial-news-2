Kenya ’s shilling weakened to a 17
year low as the central bank sought to buy foreign currency for
the sixth trading session in seven to boost reserves.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 86.85 per dollar at 1:48 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi. A close at this level would be the weakest since March
1994. The shilling weakened 0.6 percent to 123.72 per euro.  The Central Bank of Kenya has bought 3 million euros ($4.2
million) at 123.875 shillings each and will “mop up” 500
million shillings ($5.7 million) on the foreign-exchange market
through the offer of repuchase agreements, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The transactions are “in order to align net domestic
assets to the extended credit facility targets” set by the
 International Monetary Fund , it said in its weekly bulletin
dated May 13.  In a repurchase agreement an investor agrees to sell a
security to another trader, while at the same time arranging to
buy it back at a future date and at a pre-determined price.  The IMF’s executive board in January approved the extension
of a $508.7 million credit facility for Kenya. The program
targets an increase in the country’s international reserves to
four months of import cover.  The central bank will “maintain the floating exchange-rate
regime while continuing to purchase foreign exchange as needed
to achieve the foreign reserve target,” according to a
 statement  on the IMF’s website.  Kenya’s usable foreign exchange reserves declined to $3.92
billion in the week to May 13, or 3.8 months’ import cover, from
$3.96 billion in the week to May 6, the central bank said in its
weekly bulletin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
