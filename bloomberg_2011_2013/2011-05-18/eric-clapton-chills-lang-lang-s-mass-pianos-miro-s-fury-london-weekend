Eric Clapton  is settling in for a

“Layla” and “I Shot the Sheriff.”  Royal Albert Hall, Kensington Gore, London, SW7 2AP.
Clapton’s gigs continue through June 1, some with  Steve Winwood 
as co-star. Information: +44-207-589-8212,

highlight of a Tate Modern retrospective featuring more than 150
works from around the world. The Miro still life was born from
his fury at the destruction wrought by the Spanish Civil War.  Instead of the traditional depiction of beautiful objects,
he turned to household garbage -- a smashed bottle, moldy bread,
a rotten apple speared by a fork, a trampled boot. Miro puts
them into a violently discolored  setting , heavy with funereal
black and blood red.  Visitors see how Miro’s early images of the Catalan
countryside become Surreal and uncompromising. His vision
darkened as Civil War became World War, and he ends with
striking abstracts, full of blobs and squiggles.  “Joan Miro:  The Ladder of Escape ” is at Tate Modern,
Bankside, SE1 9TG, through Sept. 11. Information:

romance on the stage of the  Gielgud Theatre .  “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,” which closes on May 21,
offers a nostalgic look at first love. Guy Fouchier, a 20-year-
old auto mechanic, woos 17-year-old Genevieve Emery. He has to
leave for an army posting in  Algeria . They go their separate
ways, while always remembering what they had.  The show is based on Jacques Demy’s 1964 film that starred
a young Catherine Deneuve and featured Michel Legrand songs
later recorded by Tony Bennett and  Frank Sinatra .  The Gielgud, Shaftesbury Avenue, W1D 6AR. Information:
