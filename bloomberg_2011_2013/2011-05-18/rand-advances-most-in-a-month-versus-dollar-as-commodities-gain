The rand strengthened for a second
day this week, gaining the most in almost a month against the
dollar, as commodities rebounded.  The rand advanced as much as 1.1 percent to 6.9072 per
dollar, the biggest intraday increase since April 21, and traded
0.9 percent stronger at 6.9230 at 10:25 a.m. in  London . It
gained 0.3 percent to 9.8672 per euro. Local markets in  South
Africa  are closed today for elections.  Gold and platinum, South Africaâ€™s biggest exports,
advanced, while copper climbed for a fifth day, joining a rally
in equities and other commodities including oil, on prospects
for increased demand and as some investors ended bets on price
declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
