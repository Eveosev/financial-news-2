Swaziland, sub-Saharan  Africa ’s last
absolute monarchy, faces “severe” liquidity constraints in the
coming months and must cut spending on state wages, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The southern African nation’s economy will probably
contract 1.9 percent this year if the government implements
recommended expenditure cuts of 2 percent of gross domestic
product, the Washington-based institution said on its website.  Inflation is expected to accelerate to 8 percent in 2011,
it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
