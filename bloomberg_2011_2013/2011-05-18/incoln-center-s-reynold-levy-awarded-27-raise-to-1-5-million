Reynold Levy, president of  Lincoln
Center  for the Performing Arts, earned pay and benefits of $1.5
million in 2009, up from $1.18 million a year earlier.  The pay was disclosed in the New York cultural complex’s
2009-2010 tax return. It includes $877,200 in salary, retirement
and medical benefits and a one-time “re-signing contract
incentive,” a spokesman, Betsy Vorce, said in an e-mail. Under
Levy’s new contract, he will stay through the end of 2013, Vorce
said.  The return said the pay also includes money for objectives
achieved, including Lincoln Center’s roughly $1.2 billion
redevelopment plan.  At  Washington ’s John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing
Arts, President Michael Kaiser earned $1.1 million in 2008. Its
budget was two-thirds that of Lincoln Center. At the  Performing
Arts Center of Los Angeles County , with about a quarter of
Lincoln Center’s budget, President Stephen Rountree’s 2008
compensation was $765,485.  Previously chief of the  International Rescue Committee ,
Levy, 66, has run Lincoln Center since 2002. He has written
three books, including 2008’s “Yours for the Asking,” a guide
to nonprofit fundraising and management.  Lincoln Center’s redevelopment is in its “final stages,”
Vorce said. Renovations on the 16-acre Upper West Side campus
included rebuilding Alice Tully Hall, creating a new visitors
center and revamping 65th Street so the institution’s offerings
are more inviting and accessible. Next month, the Film Society
of Lincoln Center opens two new cinemas, and Lincoln Center
Theater is scheduled to open a new house in 2012.  ‘Almost Hip’  Critics have praised the renovation. Bloomberg’s James
Russell said the redevelopment made Lincoln Center’s
“overbearing culture palaces ... seem engaging, almost hip.”  Levy helped determine pay and benefits for senior
management but not for himself, the return said. John Goberman,
executive producer of “ Live From Lincoln Center ,” which
broadcasts classical music and other performing arts on public
television, made $510,963.  Jane Moss, vice president for programming, who is
responsible for programming American Songbook, Midsummer Night
Swing, Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival and other series,
earned $475,220. Compensation for Daniel Rubin, senior vice
president and chief financial officer, was $444,303.  Ron Austin, executive director of the Lincoln Center
Development Project, earned $591,406 in pay and benefits,
according to its  tax return . It has overseen the renovation.  -- Editors: Jeffrey Burke, Laurie Muchnick.  To contact the reporters on this story:
