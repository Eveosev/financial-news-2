The debt burdens of U.S.states are
understated and their deteriorated finances threaten the
nation’s economic recovery,  Meredith Whitney , who heads Meredith
Whitney Advisory Group LLC, wrote in the Wall Street Journal.  “Defaults in a variety of forms by states and
municipalities are already happening and more are inevitable,”
Whitney said in an opinion piece posted on the newspaper’s
website today. “Taxpayers have borne the initial brunt of these
defaults by paying higher taxes in exchange for lower social
services.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
