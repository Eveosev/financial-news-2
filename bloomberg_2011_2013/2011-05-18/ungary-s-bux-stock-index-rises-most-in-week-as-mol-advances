Hungarian shares rose the first day
in six as a jump in commodities sent shares of Mol Nyrt., the
country’s biggest refiner, higher.  The benchmark BUX index of shares gained 0.3 percent to
23,058.16 by the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, following five days
of declines, the longest losing streak since June 2010. Mol
climbed 3.1 percent to 23,300 forint, the biggest jump in six
weeks.  “Risk appetite returned this morning,” RBC Capital
Markets strategists led by  Nick Chamie  in Toronto wrote in an e-
mailed note. “Sentiment was helped by firmer commodity
prices.”  European stocks climbed, snapping the longest losing streak
in two months, as a rally in basic-resource producers and
property companies outweighed sovereign debt concerns. Crude oil
increased from a three-month low after an industry report showed
that U.S. fuel stockpiles declined as consumption rebounded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
