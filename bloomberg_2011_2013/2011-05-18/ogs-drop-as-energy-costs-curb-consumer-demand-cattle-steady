Hog futures fell to a 10-week low on
signs that U.S. pork demand is slumping as high energy costs
curb  consumer spending . Cattle prices were little changed.  Yesterday, hogs for immediate delivery declined 0.5
percent, and wholesale-pork prices slid 1.3 percent, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. The losses were the first
since May 6. On May 4, the national average of regular gasoline
at the pump reached $3.985 a gallon, the highest since July
2008, according to AAA.  Rising gas prices are “starting to eat into consumers’
pockets,” which could hurt meat demand, said Chad Henderson, a
market analyst at Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in
Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “The trade is disappointed with the cash
market this week.”  Hog futures for July settlement declined 1.75 cents, or 1.9
percent, to 91.275 cents a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price reached 90.7, the lowest
since March 4. Before today, the commodity gained 14 percent in
the past 12 months.  Cattle futures for August delivery were little changed,
rising 0.175 cent to $1.09475 a pound in Chicago. Before today,
the price advanced 20 percent in the past year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement slid 0.625
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.293 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
