The German minority government in the
western state of North-Rhine Westphalia won’t get parliamentary
approval for guarantees of as much as 5 billion euros (7.1
billion) for WestLB AG, the  Rheinische Post  newspaper reported.  Opposition parties that hold the balance of power in the
state parliament in Dusseldorf are against the WestLB plan, the
newspaper reported, citing an unidentified lawmaker from the
opposition  Christian Democrats . The parliament will debate the
government’s proposal for WestLB today, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
