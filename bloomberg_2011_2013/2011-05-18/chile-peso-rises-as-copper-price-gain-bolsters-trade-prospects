Chile’s peso strengthened against the
 U.S. dollar  as increased copper prices signaled a higher trade
surplus for the metal’s top-producing nation.  The peso rose 0.5 percent to 471.65 per dollar at 10:56
a.m. New York time from yesterday’s close of 473.97.  “Global markets are up as well as copper prices,” said
Flavio Magnasco, an economist at Banco Falabella. “Local
pension funds are also coming into the market selling dollars,
so the peso may appreciate a bit more.”  Copper, which accounts for about half of Chile’s exports,
rose as much as 2.9 percent in New York after  house prices 
increased in 67 of 70 Chinese cities tracked by the government
in April from last year. China is the world’s largest copper
consumer.  The central bank paid an average 473.21 per dollar for $50
million today as part of a $12 billion effort to limit the
peso’s gains.  Chile ’s economy grew 9.8 percent in the first quarter, the
most since 1995, as  consumer spending  and manufacturing
recovered from last year’s 8.8-magnitude earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
