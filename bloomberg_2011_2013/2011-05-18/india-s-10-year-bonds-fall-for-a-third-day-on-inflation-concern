India ’s 10-year bonds declined for a
third trading day after a government report showed that
wholesale prices rose faster than economists predicted.  Yields on the most-traded 10-year debt approached a 31-
month high after the commerce ministry said May 16 that the
inflation rate was 8.66 percent in April, compared with the 8.50
percent median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The South
Asian nation raised domestic gasoline prices by the most in
almost three years over the weekend.  “We do not recommend buying Indian bonds until there are
clear signs of inflation moderating,” said Vivek Rajpal, a
Mumbai-based fixed-income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc.
“Any moderation in inflation is unlikely as the hike in fuel
prices will keep prices elevated.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.29 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate touched 8.31 percent on May 5, the highest
level for a 10-year bond since October 2008.  The  Reserve Bank  of India lifted its repurchase rate by
half a percentage point to 7.25 percent on May 3 to cool
inflation. State-owned Indian Oil Corp., the country’s largest
refiner, raised the price of petrol by 5 rupees a liter to 63.37
rupees ($1.4), it said on its website. That is the biggest
increase since June 2008.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
increased. The rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating
rates, climbed four basis points to 8.09 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
