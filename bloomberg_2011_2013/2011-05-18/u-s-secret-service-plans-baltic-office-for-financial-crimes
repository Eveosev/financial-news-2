The U.S. Secret Service plans to open
an office in  Estonia  to serve as its regional hub in the Baltic
and Nordic regions for combating cyber and financial crimes.  The office, due to open on May 20, will cooperate with
criminal investigators in law enforcement in Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania, the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn said in an e-mailed
 statement  today. The office will also be a prime location from
which to engage counterparts in Russia and in the Nordic
countries, the embassy said.  The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  plans to move its
Baltic office from Tallinn to the Latvian capital Riga, the
 Baltic News Service  reported yesterday, citing Latvian Justice
Minister Aigars Stokenbergs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
