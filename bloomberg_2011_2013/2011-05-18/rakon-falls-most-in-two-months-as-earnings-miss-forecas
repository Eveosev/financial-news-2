Rakon Ltd. (RAK) , a supplier of crystal
oscillators for global positioning systems, fell the most in
almost 20 months in Wellington trading after reporting  earnings
that were lower than the company previously indicated.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization were NZ$24.8 million ($20 million) in the year
ended March 31, Rakon said today. The result was less than the
NZ$25 million to NZ$30 million range the Auckland-based company
forecast in November. The stock fell 7.3 percent, the biggest
drop since Sept. 23, 2009.  Rakon is expanding production in response to demand for the
oscillators, which are used in smartphones and are a component
of femtocells, which companies such as  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and
AT&T Inc. employ to improve mobile network coverage. The company
faced higher costs and depreciation as it builds a new plant in
Chengdu that will open in mid-2011 and increased capacity in
India and the U.K.  Rakon fell 9 cents to NZ$1.15 at the 5 p.m. market close in
Wellington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
