The  Boston  Bruins beat the Tampa Bay
Lighting 6-5 to tie their National Hockey League playoff series
one game apiece.  The Lightning are seeking to reach the Stanley Cup finals
for the first time since 2004, when they won the NHL title for
the only time in their 18 major league seasons. The Bruins have
lost five times in the championship series, most recently in
1990, since they won the last of their five Stanley Cup titles
in 1972.  After two games in Boston, the teams head to Tampa Bay for
games on May 19 and 21. A fifth game is scheduled for May 23 in
Boston.  The winner of the best-of-seven-game Eastern Conference
finals will play the  San Jose Sharks  or  Vancouver Canucks  in the
Stanley Cup finals. That series resumes tomorrow in Vancouver
with the Canucks leading 1-0.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
