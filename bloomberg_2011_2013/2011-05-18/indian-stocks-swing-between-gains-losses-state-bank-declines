Indian shares declined for the third
day, led by  State Bank of India (SBIN)  and automakers, amid concern
rising  interest rates  will hurt their profitability.  State Bank, the nation’s biggest lender, sank 2.4 percent
after Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said loan growth may be
restricted if the lender faces a cash crunch. The company
yesterday reported fourth-quarter profit tumbled to the lowest
in at least 10 years.  Bajaj Auto Ltd. (BJAUT) , the second-largest
motorcycle maker, decreased 1.7 percent after Managing Director
Rajiv Bajaj said cost pressure will remain even as its fourth-
quarter profit beat estimates.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
51.15, or 0.3 percent, to 18,086.20 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. The Sensex has declined 12 percent this year on concern
higher borrowing costs will hurt corporate earnings. The S&P CNX
Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange dropped 0.3 percent
to 5,420.60 and its May futures settled at 5,427. The BSE 200
Index decreased 0.5 percent to 2,240.38.  “Things are not looking good,” D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of
SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd., said from  New Delhi .
“Inflation and interest rates are the biggest concerns at the
moment. If the central bank is forced to increase rates further
it will put brakes on economic growth and corporate earnings.”  India ’s central bank on May 3 raised the benchmark
repurchase rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent, the
most since July 2008, and Governor Duvvuri Subbarao predicted
inflation will stay “elevated” until September. The central
bank’s board is meeting in the eastern city of Agartala tomorrow
and the governor will address the press after that.  Stock Valuations  Stocks on the Sensex are valued at an average 14.4 times
estimated profit, down from 21.5 times in March 2010, last
year’s high. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is at a multiple of
11.2 times.  Overseas investors sold a net 37.1 billion rupees ($822
million) of Indian stocks on May 13, the biggest single-day sale
in at least 13 years, according to the most recent data on the
 website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India . The
withdrawal reversed the year-to-date balance, leaving a net
outflow of 23.9 billion rupees.  State Bank  plunged 2.4 percent to 2,355.75 rupees,
extending this year’s decline to 16 percent. The bank will have
to be more selective on lending, Chaudhuri said yesterday. Loan
growth will moderate by as much as 3 percentage points from last
year’s levels, Chief Financial Officer Diwakar Gupta said.  State Bank’s stock rating was downgraded to “inline” from
“outperform” by Mahruk Adajania, an analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc in Mumbai.  Bajaj Auto slid 1.7 percent to 1,287.4 rupees. The company
reported fourth-quarter profit more than doubled to 14 billion
rupees, compared with the 6.64 billion rupees average of 26
analyst estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.  Export Incentives  India’s finance ministry decided not to extend beyond June
30 the Duty Entitlement Pass Book, an incentive program for
exporters, Revenue Secretary Sunil Mitra said today. The annual
revenue loss to the government from the scheme is about 80
billion rupees, he said.  “The move will affect companies like Bajaj Auto and TVS,”
said Umesh Karne, an analyst with Brics Securities Ltd. “Most
companies will have factored in the loss of the subsidy into
their costs.”  TVS Motor Co., the third-biggest motorcycle maker, slumped
2.7 percent to 52.35 rupees.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest
truckmaker and owner of Jaguar Land Rover, sank 3.4 percent to
1,149.15 rupees and its May futures settled at 1,149.95 rupees.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
lost 2 percent to 901.85 rupees and its May futures settled at
905.65 rupees. The company and partners Indian Oil Corp. and Oil
India Ltd. failed to find oil or gas in their first drilling
attempt in an exploration block in  East Timor , the Hindu
Business Line reported. Manoj Warrier, a Mumbai-based spokesman
for Reliance, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
