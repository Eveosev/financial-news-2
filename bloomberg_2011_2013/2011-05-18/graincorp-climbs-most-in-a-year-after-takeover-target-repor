GrainCorp Ltd. (GNC) , eastern Australia’s
largest grain handler, climbed the most in almost a year in
Sydney trading after the Australian newspaper reported the
company may be a takeover target for a foreign suitor.  Shares in Sydney-based GrainCorp gained 5.2 percent to
A$8.04 at 1:57 p.m. local time, the most since May 27 last year.
 Viterra Inc. (VT) , Canada’s biggest grain handler, is a “logical
acquirer” of GrainCorp, the Australian  reported  today, without
citing anyone.  “GrainCorp is cognizant of its continuous disclosure
obligations and has no information to convey to the market,”
the company said today in a statement lodged with the Australian
stock exchange. “Beyond this statement GrainCorp does not
comment on media speculation.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
