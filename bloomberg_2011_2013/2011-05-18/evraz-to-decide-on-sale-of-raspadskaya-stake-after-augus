Evraz Group SA (EVR)  will probably decide
on the future of its holding in OAO  Raspadskaya (RASP) , once the
largest Russian producer of coal for steelmaking, after August.  “We are still considering different options on the
Raspadskaya stake,” Oleg Kuzmin, Evraz’s vice president for
communications, said by e-mail today. It will probably take at
least three months, he said. Evraz, part owned by billionaire
 Roman Abramovich , holds 40 percent of the coal mining company.  A sale, if completed, will happen no sooner than in three
months, Interfax reported earlier today, citing Evraz Chairman
Alexander Abramov.  Evraz and Raspadskaya’s management, who also hold 40
percent in the coal company, hired Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan
Stanley to find a buyer for their shares, two people with
knowledge of the plans said March 10, declining to be identified
because the information is confidential. A day later, Evraz
confirmed that it’s considering what to do with its stake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
