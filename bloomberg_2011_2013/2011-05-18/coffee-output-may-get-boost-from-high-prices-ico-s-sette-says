Higher coffee prices may encourage
farmers to boost output for the 2011-12 crop year that starts in
most countries in October, helping to make up for a drop in
supplies from  Brazil , the world’s biggest grower,  International
Coffee Organization  Executive Director Jose Sette said.  Arabica coffee prices traded in  New York  have doubled in
the past year and robusta beans traded in London have climbed 84
percent. Brazil will have a smaller crop for 2011-12 as trees
are in the off-year of a biennial cycle for arabica coffee
production, Brazil’s  Agriculture Ministry  said May 10.  “There is an incentive for other countries to increase
output due to high prices,” Sette said by phone from London
today.  Global coffee production for the 2010-11 season that ends
Sept. 30 is estimated at 133 million bags, up 8.1 percent from a
year earlier, the ICO said in its April market report. Brazil’s
production in crop year 2011-12 will be 43.5 million bags, down
from 48.1 million bags a year earlier, Brazil estimates. The ICO
hasn’t made an estimate for the global production in the 2011-12
season, Sette said.  Production may gain in the 2012-13 season as Brazil’s crop
rebounds, Sette said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
