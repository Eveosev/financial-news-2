Copper prices should average $9,450 a
metric ton this year and $9,700 next year, according to Natixis
Commodity Markets Ltd. The bank raised its forecasts for the
metal from $9,000 a ton and $9,500 for 2011 and 2012
respectively.  “We would be tempted to buy on dips,” analysts including
Nic Brown in  London  said in the Natixis report today. “With
copper fundamentals remaining solidly supportive, and with some
signs emerging that Chinese copper demand is slowly beginning to
improve after the recent soft patch, this leaves us cautiously
positive on the outlook for copper prices.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
