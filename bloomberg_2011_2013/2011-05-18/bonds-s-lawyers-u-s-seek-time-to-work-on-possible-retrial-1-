Attorneys for baseball player  Barry Bonds , convicted of obstruction of justice in April, agreed with
federal prosecutors to postpone a May 20 post-trial hearing to
June 17 to provide additional time for preparation “in the
event of a retrial.”  A jury in San Francisco couldn’t reach unanimous verdicts
April 13 on charges that Bonds, who hold baseball’s homerun
record, lied to a grand jury about knowingly taking steroids and
receiving injections from his former weight trainer.  The jury convicted Bonds of one count of impeding the grand
jury’s work by giving evasive answers, and a judge declared a
mistrial on three perjury counts.  “The parties agree that additional time is needed to
evaluate the basis and need for post-trial motions, to evaluate
witness availability in the event of a retrial and to ensure
counsel has the time necessary” to prepare “in the event of a
possible retrial,” attorneys for Bonds and the government said
today in a filing in U.S. District Court.  The new date is subject to court approval. Bonds will seek
to have his conviction thrown out and obtain a new trial, his
attorneys said after the trial. Prosecutors didn’t say in the
filing whether they intend to retry Bonds.  The case is U.S. v. Bonds, 07-00732, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
