Greece will have to restructure its
debt, meaning bondholders will probably lose much of their
principal, Thomas Straubhaar, head of the HWWI economic
institute, was quoted as saying by  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  The head of the Hamburg-based institute predicted the so-
called haircut for investors in Greek sovereign bonds will be at
least 50 percent and likely more, the newspaper  reported  today,
citing an interview.  The  International Monetary Fund  and European Union
officials should organize the debt restructuring and press
Greeceâ€™s private creditors to accept an extension of bond
maturities or a quick immediate haircut, Straubhaar was quoted
as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
