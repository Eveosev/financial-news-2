Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
President  James Bullard  said the central bank will probably
begin a policy tightening by allowing its balance sheet to
decrease.  “I like a balance-sheet-first policy and I think the Fed
will take a balance-sheet-first policy,” Bullard said today in
a Bloomberg Television interview in  New York . “I would be more
aggressive about managing the balance sheet down than some other
members.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
