Iran  and Kuwait are to exchange
ambassadors again after a dispute over an alleged spy network
operating in Kuwait led to both countries expelling diplomats.  The two countries will return ambassadors “as soon as
possible,” Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told
reporters in parliament in  Kuwait City  today.  In March, a Kuwaiti court sentenced two Iranians and a
Kuwaiti to death for involvement in a spy ring in the Arab
state. Iran has denied having such an operation in Kuwait.  To contact the reporter on this story:
