Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa
today said his administration will “fix, revise and control”
the medicine prices in the South American country.  The measure creates a four-member panel of presidential
appointees to guarantee “supply and access to quality, safe,
and effective medicines,” according to a decree published today
on the government’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
