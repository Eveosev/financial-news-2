ProLogis (PLD) , the world’s largest
warehouse owner, said it will own almost 90 percent of  ProLogis
European Properties (PEPR)  after today’s expiration of a tender offer
that the European fund said was inadequate.  ProLogis received for tender or bought 96.5 million
ordinary units of ProLogis European, the Denver-based company
said today in a statement. ProLogis started a mandatory offer
for ProLogis European, or PEPR, on April 22, valuing the company
at 1.2 billion euros ($1.7 billion).  The U.S. company raised its bid to 6.20 euros a share from
6.10 euros on May 6. That was “inadequate from a financial
point of view,” PEPR said in a statement on May 11.  ProLogis agreed earlier this month to buy units of PEPR
held by rival bidder APG Algemene Pensioen Groep NV and an
affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corp.,
boosting its stake in the fund to about 60 percent.  PEPR, based in  Luxembourg , was created in 1999 as a closed-
end real estate investment fund externally managed by a
subsidiary of ProLogis, which is PEPR’s largest shareholder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
