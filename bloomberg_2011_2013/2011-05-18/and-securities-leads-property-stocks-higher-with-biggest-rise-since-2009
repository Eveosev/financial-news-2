Land Securities Group Plc (LAND) , the U.K.’s
largest real estate investment trust, led property stocks higher
with the biggest increase in 21 months after the company’s
annual profit beat analysts’ expectations.  Land Securities rose 6.4 percent in London trading and was
the biggest gainer on the European benchmark Stoxx 600 index.
The London-based company reported net income of 1.24 billion
pounds ($2 billion) for the 12 months ended March 31. Analysts
projected profit of about 979 million pounds the average of four
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  “I was blown away by these results, they are fantastic,”
 Harm Meijer , an analyst at JPMorgan in London, said by phone.
“This sends a very positive vibe through the U.K. property
sector.” Meijer has an “overweight” rating on the stock.  Land Securities and other developers have revived office
projects in central  London  in the past year to take advantage of
a rebound in rents after most plans for new buildings were
shelved during the property recession. A total of 6.4 million
square feet (595,000 square meters) of space is currently being
built across 25 projects in central London, more than double six
months ago, Drivers Jonas Deloitte said May 3.  The developer’s shares advanced the most since August 2009.
British Land Co. Plc rose 4.6 percent to 604.5 pence following
the Land Securities’ earnings report, the third-best performance
on the Stoxx 600. The U.K.’s No. 2 real estate investment trust
is due to report annual results on May 23.  Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , the
third-largest U.K. REIT, gained 3.2 percent to 479.2 pence.  Walkie-Talkie  In January, Land Securities started work on a joint venture
with Canary Wharf Group Plc to build the Walkie-Talkie tower in
London, a project it shelved in 2008. The 37-story skyscraper in
the  City of London  will cost 500 million pounds to develop and
is scheduled to be completed in 2014.  Net asset value rose 20 percent to 826 pence a share, the
company said in a statement today. That even beat Meijer’s
estimate for 2012, he said. The company’s total property return
without the use of debt was 16.8 percent, more than Investment
Property Databank Ltd’s 11.3 percent return for the market.  “We expect the positive indicators to continue,” Chief
Executive Officer Francis Salway said on a conference call. “We
set out a plan ahead of the rest of the market and it has
delivered a tangible return. We’re confident the same plan will
drive earnings growth.”  Leases Expiring  Salway said the Walkie-Talkie is being built on a
“speculative” basis, so it’s not essential to have tenants
already committed to take space in the tower. A number of older
buildings have leases that expire in the next couple of years
and Land Securities should benefit from that, he said.  The value of Land Securities’ assets increased by 908.8
million pounds in the fiscal year, compared with a rise of 863.8
million pounds a year earlier. Of the 9.7 increase, 6.3 percent
was in the second half of the year.  Total real estate purchases in the year stood at 407
million pounds at an average yield of 5.2 percent, the company
said. Property sales totaled 687 million pounds in the period.
The company increased its dividend by 0.7 percent to 28.2 pence
a share.  The company has also started work on a 230,000-square-foot
office complex in the Victoria district of west London, and has
won consent to construct a 75,000-square-foot office building in
Cannon Street that’s due to be completed in 2012.  The FTSE 350 Real Estate index, which includes Land
Securities, increased 3.4 percent, the most since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
