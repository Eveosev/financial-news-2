Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio may target a return on
equity in the “mid-to-high teens,” according to an analyst at
Evolution Securities Ltd.  A review of the bank’s operations by Horta-Osorio, who took
the top job in March, could act as a “road map” toward a 20
percent return on equity, wrote analyst Arturo de Frias in a
note to investors today.  “Lloyds is a unique restructuring story in a banks sector
completely devoid of top-line growth,” wrote de Frias.  British banks have been reassessing their profitability
targets as regulators demand more capital to prevent another
financial crisis.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  in February said it will aim
for a return on equity of 12 percent to 15 percent, instead of
15 percent to 19 percent.  Lloyds, 41 percent government-owned, would need to make
“substantial changes,” including cost reductions and the
possible sale of its Scottish Widows insurance unit to achieve a
20 percent return on equity, wrote de Frias. The London-based
bank will unveil the conclusions of its review next month, said
de Frias.  Lloyds is holding its annual general meeting for
shareholders in Glasgow at 11 a.m.  To contact the reporters on this story:
