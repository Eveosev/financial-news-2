Nujira Ltd., a U.K. developer whose
technology improves  energy efficiency  in smartphones, raised 10
million pounds ($16 million) from investors to expand
operations.  Climate Change Capital Private Equity LP, a 200 million-
euro fund, provided 6 million pounds of financing toward the
funding, followed by Amadeus Capital Partners Ltd., NES
Partners, Environmental Technologies Fund and others, according
to London-based Climate Change Capital.  “The funding will allow the expansion of Nujira’s handset
engineering team to support product development and engagements
with leading vendors in the global handset market,” Nujira
Chief Executive Officer Tim Haynes said today in an e-mail.  Nujira is planning to install its energy-efficiency
amplifiers into 800 million smartphone handsets by 2016,
according to Climate Change Capital’s statement. Smartphones
offer more features, such as Internet and e-mail access, than
ordinary cellphones.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
