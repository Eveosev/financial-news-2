(Corrects 2010 sales in third paragraph.)  Abdi Ibrahim Ilac Sanayi & Ticaret
AS,  Turkey ’s biggest generic drugmaker, said it’s in talks with
foreign companies on the possible sale of a minority stake.  The company’s owners don’t plan to sell a majority, Chief
Executive Candan Karabagli said today in Istanbul. Foreign
interest is holding up despite government cuts to drug prices,
she said.  Abdi Ibrahim aims to raise sales this year to $850 million
from $834 million in 2010, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
