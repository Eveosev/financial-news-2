GDF Suez SA,  Areva SA (CEI)  and  Vinci SA (DG) 
will form a partnership to develop offshore wind power projects
in France, where the government wants developments with 6,000
megawatts of generating capacity by 2020.  The partnership will be for three wind farms at Dieppe-Le
Treport, Courseulles-sur-Mer and Fecamp, according to a joint
statement today. The projects may meet power needs of “several
million” people for about 30 years.  France is planning to seek bids for 3,000 megawatts of
offshore wind farms that could cost about 10 billion euros
($14.3 billion) to develop. French Environment Minister Nathalie
Kosciusko-Morizet has said the tenders may start at the end of
the month. The country currently has no offshore wind capacity.  GDF Suez (GSZ) , owner of France’s natural gas network, was
already planning to build one of the three projects, a 1.8
billion-euro wind park off northern France. The Deux Cotes
project in the Dieppe-Le Treport area  is now“being put out to
tender by the government,” the utility said today.  Areva will have more than 120 installed turbines by the end
of 2013 and is Europe’s second-largest offshore wind industry
player, according to the statement.  French companies have identified about 30 sites for
development of offshore wind farms, most located in the  English
Channel , according to a 2010 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP. French sites considered favorable for offshore wind
projects include one near Utah beach in Normandy, where Allied
troops invaded occupied France during World War II.  To contact the reporter on this story:
