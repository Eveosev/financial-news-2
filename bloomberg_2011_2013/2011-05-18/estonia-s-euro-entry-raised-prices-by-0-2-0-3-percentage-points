Estonia ’s adoption of the euro in
January boosted consumer prices by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points
in the first quarter, in line with the experience in other
countries, the European Union’s statistics office said.  “Eurostat considers, therefore, that the euro changeover
effects in Estonia seem to have been noticeable but were not of
a magnitude that could drive headline inflation,” the office
said today on its  website , citing a provisional assessment.  The Baltic country’s inflation will exceed the euro zone
average for years as prices converge with those elsewhere in the
17-member currency union, according to the European Commission
and Estonian authorities.  Inflation, harmonized for EU methodology, was an annual 5.1
percent in March, compared with an average of 2.7 percent in the
euro area, Eurostat said today. Global food and fuel-price
increases may raise Estonia’s average inflation rate to 4.5
percent this year from 2.7 percent in 2010, the  Finance Ministry 
forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
