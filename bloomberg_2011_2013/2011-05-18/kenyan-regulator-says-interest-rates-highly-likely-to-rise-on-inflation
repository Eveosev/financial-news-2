Interest rates  in  Kenya , East
Africa’s biggest economy, are “highly likely” to rise because
of accelerating inflation, the  Capital Markets Authority  said.  Higher rates “may result in investors moving from the
equities market to the bonds market to benefit from the higher
returns,” the Nairobi-based regulator said in an e-mailed
quarterly report today.  Bond-trading volumes in the country increased to 109
billion shillings ($1.26 billion) in the first quarter from 87
billion shillings in the previous three-month period, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
