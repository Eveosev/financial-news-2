San Diego Gas & Electric Co., the
third largest utility in California and unit of  Sempra Energy (SRE) ,
will buy 125 megawatts of concentrated photovoltaic power to be
developed by  Soitec (SOI)  under two contracts over 25 years.  The projects will be built in San Diego County and will be
supplied by a 200 megawatt per year capacity manufacturing plant
that Bernin, France-based Soitec plans to build in the San Diego
area, the companies said today in a statement.  “These new contracts with SDG&E reinforce Soitec’s
decision to build its new manufacturing site in the San Diego
area and confirm the importance of the U.S. market for our
company,” said Soitec Chief Executive Officer Andre-Jacques Auberton-Herve.  The agreements add to Soitec and SDG&E’s three contracts
signed in April for 30 megawatts of power, the companies said.  Concentrated photovoltaic technology, known as CPV, makes
more efficient use of sunlight than conventional solar panels
through the use of lenses.  In March,  Tenaska Inc.  selected Soitec to supply its
systems for a 150-megawatt power plant in  Southern California ’s
Imperial County. Power from that plant will also be bought by
SDG&E under a 25-year contract.  To contact the reporter on this story:
