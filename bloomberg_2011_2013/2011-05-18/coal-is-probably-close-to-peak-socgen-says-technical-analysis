European coal is probably close to a
peak, according to  technical analysis  by  Societe Generale  SA.  The attached chart shows a resistance level of $128.30 a
metric ton for coal derivatives, indicated by the trend lines.
Coal for delivery next year to northwestern  Europe  rose 50
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $126.50 a metric ton by 1:46 p.m. in
 London .  Prices have climbed 5.2 percent this year on supply
disruptions after floods hit Australia’s Queensland state in
January, and as fossil-fuel demand increased as an alternative
to nuclear generation in Germany and Japan following the Asian
country’s March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  Coal will probably peak at $128.30 this week and then
decline, Carine Hemery, an analyst with Societe Generale in
Paris, said by phone yesterday.  Profit from running coal-fired  power plants  for next month,
the so-called clean-dark spread, is about 7.71 euros ($10.95) a
megawatt-hour, compared with 9.70 euros from burning natural
gas, Bloomberg data showed. The calculation uses electricity
prices in Germany and takes emissions costs into account.  Carbon Dioxide  December carbon dioxide permits under the European Union
cap-and-trade system fell 0.7 percent to 16.53 euros in London
as regulators prepared to sell phase-three allowances, which
runs from 2013 to 2020, for the first time this year.  Gas for delivery in the six months through September 2012
to the U.K., Europe’s biggest consumer of the fuel, gained 0.6
percent to 63.10 pence a therm in London.  The coal-derivative data are drawn from information
supplied by ICAP Plc,  GFI Group Inc. (GFIG) , Spectron Group Ltd.,
Credit Suisse Group AG, IHS McCloskey, Bloomberg, Tradition.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
