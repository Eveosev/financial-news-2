An outbreak of classical swine fever
was reported in the Vladimir region of central  Russia , national
food-safety watchdog  Rosselkhoznadzor  said.  The virus was found at a private farm in the village of
Melekhovo with 85 hogs, 74 of which have died from the disease,
Moscow-based Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Classical swine fever, also called hog cholera, is highly
contagious and some infected animals may show no signs of
illness while spreading the disease to others, according to Iowa
State Universityâ€™s Center for Food Security & Public Health.  To contact the reporter on this story:
