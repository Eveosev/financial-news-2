Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 40.98 points, or 1.1
percent, to 3,840.21, the biggest gain since April 20. The
market was closed yesterday for a public holiday.  PT Bank Negara  Indonesia  (BBNI IJ), the nation’s third-
largest state-owned bank, rose 1.3 percent to 3,925 rupiah, the
biggest increase since April 21. Bank Negara shareholders today
approved a cash dividend payout of 65.98 rupiah a share,
President Director Gatot Suwondo said.  PT Holcim Indonesia (SMCB IJ), the country’s third-largest
cement maker, gained 4.9 percent to 2,125 rupiah, the steepest
rally since Nov. 8, after CIMB-GK Securities Pte said in a
report today it finds “value” in the company. The stock is a
laggard to its cement peers and offers more “attractive upside
potential in terms of margins and growth,” Lydia Toisuta, a
Jakarta-based analyst at CIMB-GK, wrote in the note.  PT XL Axiata (EXCL IJ), the Indonesian unit of  Malaysia ’s
Axiata Group Bhd., climbed 1.5 percent to 6,650 rupiah, rising
for a fourth straight day. The stock was added to the MSCI
Inc.’s global standard indexes. Changes to MSCI’s indexes can
affect share prices as managers whose funds track the measures
adjust their holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
