Passengers on  United Airlines  and
Continental Airlines will see new airport signs and share check-
in kiosks today as the carriers begin melding outward operations 
seven months after completing their merger.  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  said in a statement that
it starts making the changes today at its hometown hub at
 Chicago ’s O’Hare airport, the second-busiest in the U.S. after
Atlanta.  The world’s largest airline has already repainted more than
a third of its planes to include Continental’s stylized globe
logo on the tail and United’s name on the fuselage. Passengers
have also been able to combine their frequent-flier points and
use elite status perks such as access to airport lounges on
either airline.  Items still on the to-do list include creating a fully
combined reservations system, a joint website and meshing dozens
of other technology platforms such as crew dispatching, plus
resolving representation issues for unionized work groups and
negotiating combined contracts for each group.  United Airlines parent UAL Corp. merged with Continental
Airlines Inc. in October in an all-stock deal, surpassing Delta
Air Lines Inc. as the world’s biggest carrier.  The two airlines must run separate flight operations until
the  Federal Aviation Administration  grants them a joint
certificate, which the company has said will come toward the end
of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
