Poland ’s WIG20 Index added 18.56 or
0.7 percent, to 2,824.23 at the 5:30 close in Warsaw.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s only copper
producer, advanced 2.8 percent to 182 zloty, rebounding from an
eight-week low. Copper rose for a fifth day in the longest
streak of gains since February.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil producer,
gained 2.7 percent to 51.9 zloty, snapping a five-day losing
streak. Oil rose from a three-month low in  New York  as signs of
shrinking U.S. gasoline supplies prompted bets that this month’s
price drop has been excessive.  Enea SA (ENA)   rose 1.2 percent to 19.3 zloty for a third
day of gains. The Polish government may restart the sale of its
52 percent stake in the country’s third-largest power utility,
near the end of this year, Treasury Minister Aleksander Grad
said today at a conference in Katowice, southern Poland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
