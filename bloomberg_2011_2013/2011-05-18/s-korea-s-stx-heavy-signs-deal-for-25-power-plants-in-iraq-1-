STX Heavy Industries Co. signed an
agreement today to install 25  power plants  to generate a total
of 2,500 megawatts in  Iraq , Iraqi Electricity Minister Raad Shallal said.  “This is a big event as the company will be establishing
25 plants in a region ranging from the southern city of Basra to
the south of  Baghdad ,” he said in a speech during the signing,
aired on the state-sponsored Iraqiya television.  The diesel-fired plants will be built within a total period
of 13 months, he said during the ceremony attended by Iraqi
Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  The units are half of the 50 new 100-megawatt power plants
planned by the Iraqi government at a cost of $6.25 billion. A
group of South Korean companies won the contract for the first
25 installations on April 7.  Iraq faces electricity shortages eight years after the
U.S.-led invasion that ousted President  Saddam Hussein  and its
generation and distribution network have suffered from decades
of conflict, sanctions and sabotage. The country sought bids
this year to build more than 60 power plants to add more than
14,000 megawatts to the grid.  Iraq produces 7,000 megawatts and imports 1,000 megawatts
while domestic demand totals about 14,000 megawatts, Shallal
said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
