 The state-owned Asset Management
Corp. of  Nigeria , or Amcon, will buy bad debts if they exceed 5
percent of banks’ “non-performing loans” or pose a risk to the
banking system, said Chief Executive Office Mustafa Chike-Obi.  Banks with such loans will need to ask the  Central Bank  of
Nigeria to authorize Amcon to buy the debts, Chike-Obi said
today in a presentation at an investment conference organized by
 Renaissance Capital  in the commercial capital, Lagos.  Nigeria set up Amcon to buy toxic assets from the country’s
lenders after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 threatened the
banking industry with collapse. The central bank fired the chief
executives of eight of the nation’s 24 lenders and bailed out
the industry with 620 billion naira ($3.96 billion).  The underlying value of assets bought by Amcon in its two
phases of purchases to date is about 3 trillion naira, Executive
Director Foluke Dosumu said on April 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
