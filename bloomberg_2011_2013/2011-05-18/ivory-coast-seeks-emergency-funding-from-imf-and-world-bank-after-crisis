Ivory Coast’s government is meeting a
delegation from the  International Monetary Fund , the  World Bank 
and the African Development Bank to discuss emergency funds in a
bid to stabilize the West African nation’s post-crisis economy.  “The consequences of the crisis are huge for all sectors of
the economy,” Finance Minister Charles Diby Koffi told reporters
in Abidjan, the commercial capital, today. “We called on the
donors for help.”  The economy of the world’s top cocoa producer is recovering
from a four-month political crisis that following a disputed
November presidential vote. More than 2,000 people may have died
in post-election violence, according to the  United Nations .  Ivory Coast’s economy may contract 7.5 percent this year,
from growth of 2.6 percent in 2010, the Washington-based IMF
said on its website. The fund said on May 13 it had reopened its
office in Abidjan. The delegation will be in the country for
about two weeks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
