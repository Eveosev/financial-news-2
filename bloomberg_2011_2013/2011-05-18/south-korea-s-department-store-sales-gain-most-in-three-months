Sales at major South Korean
department stores climbed the most in three months as an
economic expansion and wage increases spurred consumption.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 15.1 percent
from a year earlier in April, after rising 13.1 percent in March,
the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.  Discount-store sales rose 4.6 percent in April from a year
earlier after a 1.9 percent gain in March, today’s report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
