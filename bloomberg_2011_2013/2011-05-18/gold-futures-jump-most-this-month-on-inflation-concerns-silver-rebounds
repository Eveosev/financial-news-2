Gold futures rose the most this month
as grain and energy prices surged, boosting the appeal of the
precious metal as a hedge against inflation. Silver jumped
almost 4 percent.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
gained as much as 2.6 percent. Global food costs are close to
the highest ever, according to the  United Nations , and crude oil
topped $100 a barrel today. Analysts surveyed by Germany’s Ifo
research institute raised their 2010 global inflation forecast
to 3.8 percent from 3.4 percent.  “The risk appetite is coming back to commodities across
the board,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “There are still a lot of
strong economies that want to buy commodities. Anytime you see a
pullback, people will come in and buy gold to hedge against
inflation and diversify away from the dollar.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $15.80, or 1.1 percent,
to settle at $1,495.80 an ounce at 1:43 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest gain since April 29.  Accelerating inflation,  Europe ’s debt crisis, a slumping
dollar and fighting in Libya boosted gold to a record $1,577.40
on May 2.  Gold held in exchange-traded products fell 1.49 metric tons
to 2,037.8 tons yesterday, the lowest since April 7, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Futures have dropped 3.9 percent
this month.  “Perceptions that gold may have put in a medium-term top
in the upper $1,570s before the month got under way probably
contributed to the exodus from the ETP niche,” said Jon Nadler,
an analyst at Kitco Inc. in Montreal.  Silver futures for July delivery climbed $1.606, or 4.8
percent, to $35.097 an ounce, the biggest gain since May 9.  Palladium futures for June delivery rose $22.95, or 3.2
percent, to $737.20 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the largest increase since April 20.  Platinum futures for July delivery rose $18.90, or 1.1
percent, to $1,779.90 an ounce, the biggest gain this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
