United Nations operations in
 Ethiopia ’s drought-stricken Somali region were suspended after a
World Food Programme worker was killed in an ambush on May 13, a
WFP spokeswoman said.  One person was injured in the attack on the road from the
regional capital, Jijiga, to Fik and two others are still
missing, Judith Schuler said in an interview from the capital,
Addis Ababa, today.  “All UN operations in Somali region are currently on hold,”
she said. “It’s a UN decision. We need to make sure the
situation is safe to continue.”  Ethiopia’s government last month issued an appeal backed by
aid agencies for $75 million to provide emergency help to 2
million people in the south and southeast of the Horn of Africa
nation. All parts of the region have been experiencing a
drought.  The situation is “gradually improving” after rainfall over
the past two weeks, the UN Office for Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs said in an e-mailed statement on May 16.
More rain is forecast in the next few weeks, it said.  The government blamed the attack on “remnants” of the
Ogaden National Liberation Front, a rebel movement that has been
fighting for self-determination of the Ogaden area of the region
since 1984. The group said in a May 16 statement that the attack
was carried out by the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
