Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) ,
an acquisition target of two rivals, adopted a provision that
gives its shareholders the right to purchase shares of a new
series of preferred stock to thwart a hostile takeover.  If an investor acquires at least 20 percent of the shares
or adds to an existing 20 percent holding without board
approval, the other shareholders will be allowed to buy Dollar
Thrifty at a 50 percent discount, the Tulsa, Oklahoma-based
company said today in a statement.  Dollar Thrifty, the fourth-largest U.S. car-rental company,
said it is cooperating with  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s and
Avis Budget Group’s efforts to get regulatory approval for their
purchase offers.  “We see the rights plan as a temporary measure that is
consistent with our fiduciary duties,” Scott Thompson, Dollar
Thrifty’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Dollar Thrifty rose 15 cents to $80.60 today in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 71
percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
