New Jersey  had 33 percent fewer
residents who earned at least $1 million of annual income in
2009 than in 2007, the Legislature’s chief fiscal officer said.  The state’s wealthiest residents reported 43 percent less
income over that period,  David Rosen , budget analyst for the
nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, told lawmakers
today. Losses in the stock market were the primary driver of the
decrease, he said. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell almost
24 percent from the end of 2007 through December 2009.  “It’s purely driven by the economy,” Rosen told the
Senate Budget Committee today. “We knew that the wealthiest
one-half of 1 percent who pay about one-third of the income tax
were important, but we hadn’t anticipated that their fortunes
would account for more than three-quarters of the revenue
decline.”  Those earning $1 million or more and filing tax returns in
the state fell to 11,900 from 17,900 during the two-year period,
he said. Rosen said the decline in tax-collections from this
group wasn’t because of migration.  Rosen has projected revenue will be $914 million more
through June 2012 than targets contained in Governor  Chris Christie ’s $29.4 billion budget. The governor’s administration
projects a smaller $511 million increase from previous targets
made in February.  Stronger Footing  The revision shows the state is on a stronger footing as he
seeks to curb spending and trim government payrolls at the state
and local levels, said Christie, speaking at a town-hall meeting
in Monroe Township. The governor, a Republican, said he plans to
divide the $511 million equally between pension and property tax
rebates.  “The debate we’re having now in Trenton is how much better
the budget situation is -- not whether it’s better but by how
much,” said Christie. “I don’t hear the folks who were
criticizing my first 16 months say what they should be saying --
that we were right.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
