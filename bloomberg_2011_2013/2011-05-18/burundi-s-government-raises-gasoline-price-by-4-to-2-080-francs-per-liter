Burundi’s government increased
gasoline prices by 4 percent, citing higher costs of crude on
international markets.  A liter of premium gasoline will increase to 2,080
Burundian francs ($1.68) with effect from today, compared with
2,000 francs previously, the Commerce, Industry and Tourism
Ministry said in a statement distributed to the media yesterday
in the capital, Bujumbura.  Today’s increase in gasoline prices is the fourth since
January in the East African country.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
