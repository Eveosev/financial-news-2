Damodar Valley Corp., an Indian power
utility, may seek bids for supply of coal from overseas at the
end of June, India Coal Market Watch said, citing an
unidentified company official.  The country’s Central Electricity Authority, a supervisory
body, asked Damodar Valley to import 1.73 million metric tons of
thermal coal for the year ending March 2012, similar to last
year’s target, the newsletter said. The utility bought 660,000
tons of coal from overseas in the year ended March 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
