GRTgaz, the French natural-gas
company owned by GDF Suez SA, is worth 6.5 billion euros ($9.3
billion), up from 5.6 billion euros in 2008, French Finance
Minister  Christine Lagarde  told parliament today.  The higher value came after GDF Suez invested 2 billion
euros in the unit, she said in response to a question from a
lawmaker on the planned sale of a 25 percent stake.  “This is a way to give big groups the means to develop,”
Lagarde said, referring to GRTgaz. “It’s a very simple
mechanical, quasi-mathematical value based on assets.”  Caisse des Depots et Consignations, the French state-owned
bank known as CDC, and CNP Assurances SA are in “advanced”
talks with GDF Suez to buy 25 percent of GRTgaz for 1.1 billion
euros, CDC said in an April 14 statement. Under French law, the
acquirers of the network have to be state-controlled entities.
GDF Suez has announced a plan to sell 10 billion euros of assets
through 2013.  GDF Suez will raise 2 billion euros from the sale of the
stake in GRTgaz,  Les Echos  reported April 15, citing Chief
Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet. GRTgaz will pay the utility
an “exceptional dividend” as part of the sale, the report
said.  GRTgaz, which delivers natural gas to 85 percent of  France ,
operates more than 32,000 kilometers of pipelines across the
country except the southwest where Total SA has a network. The
prices it charges for transporting the energy are regulated by
the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
