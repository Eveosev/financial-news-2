Uganda  may establish an
infrastructure fund to boost investment in major projects in the
East African nation, said the Uganda Securities Exchange.  A schedule for the creation of the fund will be determined
by a joint study into Uganda’s infrastructure needs by the
exchange and the U.S. Agency for International Development,
Joseph Kitamirike, the bourse’s chief executive, said today at a
function in the capital, Kampala.  “We have started on the study and we should conclude it by
end of July,” he said. “The study will guide us on the
country’s infrastructure funding requirements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
