Spanish consumers probably will
underpay their electricity bills by 8 billion euros ($11.4
billion) this year,  Endesa SA (ELE)  executives said in a meeting with
investors in  Madrid , Cinco Dias reported.  The gap between what regulators let utilities charge and
the costs they’re allowed to recover in customer bills is capped
by law at 3 billion euros and it will be exceeded by 5 billion
euros in 2011, the power company forecast at yesterday’s
briefing, according to the newspaper report.  The so-called tariff deficit was about 5.6 billion euros in
2010, a sum that consumers must reimburse to power companies
over a period of years, under Spanish law.  Endesa Chief Executive Officer Andrea Brentan said at the
meeting that regulated rates need to rise 10 percent in both
2012 and 2013, a spokesman confirmed today. He forecast
wholesale power prices in  Spain  to reach 60.8 euros a megawatt-
hour in 2015, 74 percent higher than this year, according to the
report.  To contact the reporters on this story: Todd White in Madrid at
