The dollar reversed earlier declines
against the euro and yen before data forecast to show U.S.
existing home sales grew at a slower pace.  The U.S. currency strengthened against most of its 16 major
counterparts.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose after the government
said its projected budget surplus in fiscal 2015 will be larger
than forecast in December.  The U.S. currency was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.4225 per
euro as of 9:05 a.m. in  London , reversing a loss of as much as
0.4 percent. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar
appreciated 0.2 percent to 81.84 from 81.51 yen earlier.  New Zealand’s operating surplus will be NZ$1.3 billion ($1
billion) in the year through June 2015 from a record NZ$16.7
billion deficit in the current period ending June 30, Finance
Minister Bill English said in a budget released today in
Wellington. The government said it will save NZ$5.2 billion over
four years to spend on earthquake recovery and core services.  “We thought they were going to come up with a pretty tough
budget, and it looks like that’s what they’ve delivered,” said
 Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth
Bank of  Australia , the nation’s biggest lender. “The markets
responded positively.”  Kiwi Gains  New Zealand’s dollar rose to 79.15 U.S. cents from 78.91
cents and climbed 0.5 percent to 64.75 yen.  Japan ’s gross domestic product contracted an annualized 3.7
percent in the three months ended March 31, the Cabinet Office
said today in Tokyo, showing the effect on the economy from a
record earthquake and deadly tsunami on March 11. That puts the
country into its third recession in a decade, with the  Bank of
Japan  set to end a two-day policy meeting tomorrow.  “People see few reasons to buy the yen as the earthquake
weighs on the economy and growth and the BOJ is poised to move
toward further policy easing,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager of
the foreign bond department in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Securities Co.  Japan’s key interest rate of zero to 0.1 percent compares
with 1.25 percent in the euro area, 4.75 percent in Australia
and 2.5 percent in New Zealand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
