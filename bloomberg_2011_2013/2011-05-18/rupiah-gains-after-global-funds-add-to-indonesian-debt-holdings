Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, rebounding
from its weakest level in more than a week, after global funds
added to holdings of the nation’s debt assets to benefit from
higher yields. Benchmark bonds gained.  Overseas investors boosted holdings of Indonesian
government debt by 1.5 percent from the end of April to 224.69
trillion rupiah ($26.2 billion) as of May 16, according to
official data. The nation’s benchmark rate of 6.75 percent
compares with a maximum of 0.5 percent in the U.S. and the U.K.
The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose as regional stocks
climbed.  “Most Asian currencies are stronger today, including the
rupiah, driven by the stock markets” said Lindawati Susanto,
head of treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.
“There’s risk appetite in the market driven by confidence about
growth in  Asia . On the Indonesian front, the economy is doing
well.”  The rupiah gained 0.5 percent from May 16 to 8,563 per
dollar as of 4:24 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Financial markets in Indonesia were closed yesterday
for a public holiday. The currency dropped to 8,603 on May 16,
the weakest level since May 6.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index rose today, halting four days
of decline. Indonesia’s key stock index, the  Jakarta Composite
Index (JCI) , gained 1.1 percent to 3,840.21 today.  Ten-year  government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 slipped seven basis points to 7.56
percent today from 7.63 percent on May 16, according to prices
from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  Southeast Asia ’s largest economy grew 6.5 percent last
quarter, after climbing 6.9 percent in the previous three months.
Gross domestic product may rise 6 percent to 6.5 percent this
year,  Bank Indonesia  said on May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
