U.K. public-sector workers will vote
on a possible strike over the government’s cuts to jobs, pay and
pensions, the  Public and Commercial Services union  said.  Ballot papers will be sent out next week and voting will
close in mid-June, the union said in an e-mailed statement after
its annual conference in Brighton, southern  England , approved
the call for a vote today. The union, which represents more than
300,000 workers, said it is working with teaching unions that
are also balloting on  strike action , bringing the potential
total numbers who may strike to 750,000.  “The economic crisis was not caused by our members’ jobs,
pensions or pay and it is shameful and wrong that the coalition
government is attempting to scapegoat them in its bid to slash
and burn the welfare state,” PCS General Secretary  Mark Serwotka  said. “Everything we have ever worked for is under
threat -- but we know there is an alternative and we are
committed to fighting for it and, if necessary, striking for
it.”  Prime Minister David Cameron’s government is aiming to
virtually eliminate the  budget deficit  by 2015, with the loss of
an estimated 310,000 jobs in the public sector. Most government
workers’ pay is being frozen for two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
