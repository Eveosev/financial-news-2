Watami Co., an operator of Japanese-
style pubs, will partner with a power-generation company to
build a 2,000-kilowatt wind turbine in Akita, northern  Japan ,
the Nikkei newspaper said.  Tokyo-based Watami, which also operates nursing homes, will
use the electricity for its care facilities. The project will
cost about 600 million yen, the newspaper reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
