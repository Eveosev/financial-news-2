OAO  Uralkali (URKA) , a Russian potash maker
poised to create the world’s biggest producer by taking over OAO
Silvinit, will pay half the companies’ 2010 profit as dividends.  “The dividends will be paid on all Uralkali’s ordinary
shares, including two additional issuances to be converted into
Silvinit shares resulting from its combination with Uralkali,”
the company said in a statement today. The payment will be 4.55
rubles a share and about $0.80 a global depositary receipt.  Uralkali reported 2010 net income of 16.6 billion rubles
($593 million) and Silvinit posted earnings of 11.5 billion
rubles, the companies said in a joint statement on April 1,
giving a combined profit of about $1 billion.  Billionaire Suleiman Kerimov and business partners bought
controlling stakes in Uralkali and Silvinit last year to merge
the two companies. They may have spent about $7 billion on the
acquisitions and will seek to use dividend payments to recoup
their investment and pay interest on loans, Marina Alexeenkova,
an analyst at OAO Gazprombank, said in March.  The record date for dividend payments is May 24.  Uralkali also nominated Robert Margetts and Paul Ostling as
independent directors after the two served on the boards of
Anglo American Plc and OAO Mobile TeleSystems respectively.
Uralkali proposed Chairman  Alexander Voloshin  retain his post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
