GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA,  Europe ’s largest
natural-gas network operator, said it’s studying other ways to
supply  Chile ’s central electricity grid after President
Sebastian Pinera requested it relocate a coal-fired project.  GDF Suez will focus on the natural gas business and
hydroelectric opportunities in Chile, Juan Claveria, the Paris-
based utility’s head of operations in the South American
country, said in an interview at a Santiago conference today.  GDF Suez wants to learn from its experience with the
Barrancones project following Pinera’s intervention in August
after the nation’s environmental regulator granted approval for
the 540-megawatt coal-fired plant, Claveria said. While Pinera
asked GDF Suez to find a new location for Barrancones, the
company has no plans to undertake a study into a new
thermoelectric plant for the central grid, he said.  E-CL SA, a GDF Suez unit, will start operating two coal-
fired plants halfway through the year to supply the northern
grid, he told the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
