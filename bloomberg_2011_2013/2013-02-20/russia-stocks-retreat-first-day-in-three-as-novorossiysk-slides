slumped 5.1 percent to the lowest since October 2011.  “The Micex reached its peak in January and there isn’t
enough demand from investors to push it higher in the near
term,”  Sergey Fundobny , head of research at Arbat Capital in
Moscow, said by phone.  OAO Rostelecom  rose as much as 3.6 percent, the second-
biggest gainer on the index, as Vedomosti reported that

10.5 percent of Russia’s state-run telephone operator, is in
talks with billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov ’s Onexim Group about
selling the percent stake. Marshall Capital declined to comment

to compete to handle the government’s sale of a stake, according
to a Feb. 18 statement.  OAO RusHydro  declined 0.9 percent to 70.02 kopeks, the
lowest level since March 2009, as the company filed a claim with
Russian investigators on alleged embezzlement of funds for the

Ministry said in a statement today. Putin said on Feb. 13
RusHydro needs to investigate the disappearance of “billions of
rubles” during construction.  Price Swings  Ten-day price swings  on the Micex rose to 14.355, while the
