Mechanical Lloyd Co. , which sells
cars, trucks and farming machinery in Ghana, rose to the highest
in almost 2 1/2 years as the company’s second-biggest investor
sold its stake.  The stock rose 6.7 percent to 17 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
close in the capital, Accra. That’s the highest since September
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. As many as 8.83
million shares were traded,  in line  with the 17.6 percent
holding of the West African nation’s state-owned pension fund,
the data show.  The Social Security and National Insurance Trust sold its
holding back to Mechanical Lloyd’s owners,  Jerome Eshun , general
manager in charge of investment and development, said by phone
today. The Accra-based fund negotiated the price, he said,
declining to comment further.  “It’s a good show for the seller,” Nana Kofi Agyeman
Gyamfi, a stock trader at  Merban Stockbrokers Ltd.  in Accra,
said by phone today. “Considering the price at the time of
purchase and today, it thought it was a good day to let them
go.”  Managing Director  Terence Ronald Darko , who has headed the
company since 1977 according to its website, wasn’t immediately
available to comment, a woman who answered the phone at his
Accra office said today. Darko holds 24 percent of the company’s
stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mechanical Lloyd’s net income rose to 6.6 million cedis
($3.5 million) in 2012 from 3.2 million cedis a year before as
sales grew 39 percent to 47 million cedis, it said in a Feb. 5
 statement  to the Ghana Stock Exchange.  “For Mechanical Lloyd, once the currency is stable, expect
them to perform well,” said Gyamfi. “We expect the cedi to be
more stable this year than last year, considering government’s
plans to cut the budget deficit.”  After falling 14 percent against the dollar in 2012, the
cedi has gained 0.3 percent this year to trade at 1.899 per
dollar today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
