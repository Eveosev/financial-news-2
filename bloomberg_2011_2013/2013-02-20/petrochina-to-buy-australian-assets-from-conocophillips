PetroChina Co. (857) , China’s biggest oil
and gas producer, will buy stakes in two Western Australia
exploration assets from  ConocoPhillips. (COP)  The two companies will
also jointly study shale-gas development in China.  PetroChina will purchase a 20 percent stake in the Poseidon
offshore discovery in Australia’s Browse Basin and a 29 percent
interest in the Goldwyer Shale onshore project in Canning Basin,
the Beijing-based company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The company didn’t disclose financial terms.  The agreements are “a significant step toward increased
global collaboration” with ConocoPhillips, PetroChina said in
the statement. “For PetroChina, this is also an important
movement to continue improving the offshore LNG and onshore
unconventional oil and gas developments in West Australia.”  The deal comes after PetroChina agreed to pay  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP)  $1.63 billion for its holding in  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ’s
proposed Browse liquefied natural gas project in Western
Australia in December. The Chinese state-owned company has said
it wants half of its oil and gas output to come from overseas by
the end of the decade.  PetroChina and ConocoPhillips will jointly study
unconventional gas resources in the Neijiang-Dazu Block in
China’s Sichuan Basin, according to yesterday’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
