Victor Oladipo scored the final six
points as top-ranked Indiana University ended with a 9-1 run to
rally past No. 4 Michigan State University 72-68 in a men’s
college basketball game.  Indiana (24-3) stayed atop the Big Ten conference with a
12-2 record, ahead of second-place Michigan State (22-5, 11-3
Big Ten).  Oladipo tipped in a shot with 47 seconds left in the game
to put the Hoosiers ahead 68-67, and followed 37 seconds later
with a dunk for a 70-67 lead. Michigan State’s Gary Harris
missed two of three free throws with four seconds left and
Oladipo finished the scoring by making two free throws.  “I’ve got a team with unbelievable maturity,” Indiana
coach  Tom Crean  said in a televised interview. “They never
panic.”  Oladipo led the Hoosiers with 19 points and nine rebounds,
while Cody Zeller added 17 points at the Jack Breslin Student
Events Center in East Lansing, Michigan.  Harris had 19 points for the Spartans and Adreian Payne
contributed 17 points.  In other games involving top-five teams, second-ranked
Miami defeated Virginia 54-50 to remain undefeated in 13 games
against Atlantic Coast Conference competitors and Missouri
earned a 63-60 win to hand No. 5 Florida its second Southeastern
Conference loss in 13 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
