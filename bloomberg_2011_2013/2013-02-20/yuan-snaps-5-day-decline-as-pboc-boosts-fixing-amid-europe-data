The yuan advanced by the most in
more than five weeks after the People’s Bank of China raised the
currency’s reference rate for the first time in three days amid
global growth optimism.  The People’s Bank of China strengthened the daily yuan
 fixing  by 0.03 percent to 6.2804 per dollar. It drained funds
from the financial system yesterday via repurchase agreements
for the first time in eight months. A report yesterday showed
economic sentiment in Germany increased to the highest level in
almost three years. Europe and the U.S. are the top destinations
for Chinese goods.  “China remains an export-dependent nation, so a better
outlook in Europe will support the yuan,” said  Stella Lee ,
president at Success Wealth Management Ltd. in Hong Kong. “The
first repos in eight months fueled concerns of tightening and
hence bolstered demand for the yuan.”  The currency rose 0.11 percent, the biggest increase since
Jan. 11, to close at 6.2376 per dollar in Shanghai, prices from
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System show. The currency lost
0.24 percent in the five trading days through yesterday, when it
touched 6.2454, the lowest level since Dec. 14. Spot prices are
allowed to diverge a maximum 1 percent from the reference rate.  The central bank gauged demand today for a sale of 28- and
91-day repurchase contracts tomorrow, according to a trader.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency gained 0.09
percent to 6.2348 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.06
percent to 6.3195, a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot
rate.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, was
unchanged at 1.2775 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
