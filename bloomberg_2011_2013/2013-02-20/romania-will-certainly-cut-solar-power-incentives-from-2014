Romania will “certainly” reduce
incentives for solar power generation from 2014 to avoid
overcompensation, according to Zoltan Nagy-Bege, a board member
at the country’s energy regulator, also known as ANRE.  Nagy-Bege told reporters in Bucharest today that he
“personally’’ thinks the number of the so-called green
certificates granted for solar power production will decline
below four from the current number of six.  To contact the reporter on this story:
