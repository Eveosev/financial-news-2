Joe Root scored 79 not out off 56
balls as England beat New Zealand by eight wickets, tying the
best-of-three one-day cricket series at 1-1.  The 22-year-old Root and Jonathan Trott, who was unbeaten
on 65, guided England past the host’s tally of 269 with 14 balls
of the 50-over game in Napier left.  Root hit seven fours and two sixes in his highest
international-match tally. Alastair Cook made 78 and Ian Bell,
England’s other opening batsman, got 44.  Earlier, New Zealand’s Ross Taylor scored a century and
 Brendon McCullum  smashed 74 off 36 balls.  James Anderson took five wickets for 34 runs to lead
England’s bowlers. New Zealand was dismissed with seven balls to
spare after being sent in to bat.  The third match is scheduled Feb. 23 in Auckland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
