BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, will change the
fees it charges for stock trading to bring them closer to
international prices, Chief Executive Officer  Edemir Pinto  said.  The new charges will be announced on Mar. 5, Pinto said in
a meeting with analysts at BM&FBovespa headquarters in Sao Paulo
today. He declined to give further details.  “The new pricing policy will be more adequate to the
conditions in the Brazilian market,” Pinto said. The changes
shouldn’t have an impact of BM&FBovespa’s earnings this year, he
said.  Shares fell 1.9 percent to 13.27 reais at 1:57 p.m. in Sao
Paulo today, the lowest on a closing basis in 10 weeks, after
the exchange reported fourth-quarter profit that trailed
estimates. Adjusted net income was 379.4 million reais ($193.4
million) in the three months ending in December, which compares
with an average  forecast  of 396.2 million reais among six
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
