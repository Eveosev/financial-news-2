Germany’s switch from nuclear power
to renewables may cost the country an extra 300 billion euros
($400 billion) unless the government wins approval for plans to
slow growth in green-energy prices, a minister said.  The proposals, agreed to by the coalition government last
week, may cut costs from about 1 trillion euros, Environment
Minister  Peter Altmaier  said. He’s seeking a cross-party
consensus in the next six to eight weeks for the plans that
include cuts in subsidies for current and new renewables
projects, and reduced support for energy-intensive companies.  “I don’t want to limit the renewable expansion, I want to
make it affordable,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin.  The cost of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision following
Japan’s Fukushima nuclear meltdown to shutter atomic plants by
2022 in favor of renewables has becoming a campaign theme before
a Sept. 22 election. At the same time, Social Democrat opponents
say government proposals will slow the expansion of renewables.  Germany would pay about 676 billion euros of subsidies by
2022 should wind turbine and solar panel installations continue
at the pace of recent years, Altmaier said. The balance of the 1
trillion euros would pay for measures such as reserving capacity
for when renewables aren’t able to generate power and making
buildings more energy-efficient, the minister said.  Meanwhile, German carbon-dioxide emissions in 2012 may have
increased for the first time in years because more coal has been
burned to produce electricity instead of gas, Altmaier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
