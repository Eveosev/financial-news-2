Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe  will be
accompanied by his top currency official when he visits the U.S.
to meet with President  Barack Obama , as Japan tries to limit
international friction over a weakening yen.  Vice Finance Minister  Takehiko Nakao  is part of a
delegation arriving in Washington tomorrow, according to two
officials with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named
because of government policy. Usually, a more junior official,
the director-general of the international bureau, would
accompany Abe on such a trip, two officials said.  Abe’s first visit to the U.S. since becoming prime minister
in December comes amid international concern at the speed of the
yen’s decline and Japanese officials indicating acceptable
levels for the currency. U.S. Treasury Undersecretary  Lael Brainard  has welcomed Japan’s efforts to “reinvigorate
growth,” while saying that nations need to avoid “loose talk
about currencies.”  The Group of 20 avoided singling out Japan for criticism at
a meeting of finance chiefs in Moscow, with nations instead
pledging not to target their exchange rates for competitive
purposes.  The yen weakened about 13 percent in the past three months
against the dollar as Abe pledges more expansive monetary easing
to spur growth. It traded at 93.48 per dollar as of 12:12 p.m.
in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
