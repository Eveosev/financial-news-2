Prada SpA , the Italian maker of
$2,200  cobalt blue totes , reported a 29 percent increase in
full-year sales, led by demand in Europe and Asia.  Revenue climbed to 3.3 billion euros ($4.4 billion) in the
12 months through January, the Milan-based company said
yesterday in a statement. The  average  of 28 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 3.31 billion euros. Excluding currency
swings, sales advanced 23 percent.  Fourth-quarter sales rose 14 percent, excluding currency
moves, even as the company limited markdowns, Prada said. That
compares with a 12 percent gain at Gucci owner  PPR SA  and 19
percent at  Hermes International SCA  in the last three months of
2012.  Prada  said in December it was confident of positive full-
year results as shoppers spent more on higher-priced goods and
Asian tourists helped buoy demand in Europe.  “The strength of our brands, our ability to interpret and
anticipate market trends and our global retail network continue
to form the basis for our long-term growth strategy,” Prada
Chief Executive Officer  Patrizio Bertelli  said in the statement.  Prada  climbed 3.2 percent to HK$74.75 after earlier
declining by as much as 1.9 percent. The  stock  has gained 1.1
percent this year after more than doubling in 2012.  Comparable Sales  Full-year  sales  climbed 19 percent in Italy, 33 percent in
the rest of Europe and 23 percent in the Asia-Pacific region,
excluding currency swings, Prada said. Sales gained 15 percent
in the Americas and 8 percent in Japan on the same basis.  Growth was driven mainly by the Prada and Miu Miu brands,
which expanded 33 percent and 16 percent respectively, the
company said.  Still, sales growth at stores open at least a year slowed
to 14 percent from the 19 percent it reported in August. That
met the company’s forecast of a percentage increase in the mid-
teens. It didn’t provide data on fourth-quarter comparable, or
same-store sales, which strip out the effect of newly opened
outlets.  Comparable sales probably slowed to the “mid- to high-
single digit rate” in the fourth quarter  Candy Huang , a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Barclays Plc wrote in a research note
today. She has an overweight  rating  on the stock.  It would be the first time Prada would have had same-store
sales growth of less than 10 percent since listing in 2011,
Huang said. “Investors may question its  growth  potential going
into 2013.”  Sales in Prada’s own stores climbed 29 percent, while
wholesale revenue grew 6 percent, excluding currency swings,
even as the number of third-party outlets fell, the company
said. Retail sales now account for 82 percent of total revenue,
it said.  Prada  operated 461 stores directly at the end of
January.  Prada said it tentatively plans to report full-year results
on April 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
