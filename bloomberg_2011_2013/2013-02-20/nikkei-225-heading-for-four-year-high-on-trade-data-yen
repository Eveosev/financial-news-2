dangers of a prolonged relaxed policy when he was a deputy five
years ago, though he says his views have changed. The yen fell
to as weak as 93.83 against the dollar before gaining to 93.51.  “There are lots of different reports about who it’s going
to be, but whoever it is, I think they will toe the line of the
government anyway,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief fund manager at

yen.  Shares rose even after data showed Japan’s trade deficit
swelled to a record 1.63 trillion yen ($17.4 billion) on energy
