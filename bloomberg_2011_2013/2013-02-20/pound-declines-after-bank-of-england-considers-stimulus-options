The pound declined to the lowest
leve in more than 15 months against the euro after minutes of
the Bank of England’s most recent meeting showed officials
considered options including an interest-rate cut to bolster the
economy.  Britain’s currency weakened 0.6 percent to 87.35 pence per
euro at 9:34 a.m. London time, the lowest level since October
2011. It fell 0.4 percent to $1.5370.  To contact the reporter on this story:
