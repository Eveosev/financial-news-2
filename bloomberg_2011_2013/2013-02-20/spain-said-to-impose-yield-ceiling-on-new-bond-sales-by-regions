Spain is limiting the amount of
interest its 17 semi-autonomous regions can pay to borrow,
shutting many out of debt markets, as it seeks to repair the
nation’s finances, two people familiar with the matter said.  The government wants administrations to pay yields no more
than 100 basis points above sovereign securities when they sell
bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified before
the policy is announced. Catalonia, the nation’s biggest region,
pays 314 basis more than government debt on its 1 billion euros
($1.3 billion) of 4.95 percent bonds due 2020.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s goals include asserting more
central control over the nation’s finances and containing local
spending. Spain, which is fighting to maintain its financial
sovereignty, missed the 2012 budget-deficit target set by the
European Commission. Its public debt rose to 77.4 percent in the
third quarter compared with 36 percent at the end of 2007 before
the property bubble collapsed.  “The government needs to be sure that regions don’t hurt
its efforts to get the country’s debt under control,” said
Serafi Rodriguez, an Andorra-based fixed-income trader at
Morabanc, which manages 6.4 billion euros of assets, including
debt from Spanish regions. “Only Madrid and possibly the Basque
Country and Navarra could access the market under these
conditions.”  Castile-Leon  An Economy Ministry spokesman in Madrid declined to
comment.  The limit applies to 598 million euros ($802 million) of
bonds that Castile-Leon proposes selling after getting
authorization from central government on Feb. 15, said the
region’s budget spokeswoman who asked not to be identified in
line with policy.  Limiting access to markets may force cash-strapped local
authorities to seek aid from Rajoy’s 23 billion-euro regional
rescue fund, known as the  FLA , the people said. Created in July
and tapped by nine regions last year, the FLA provides emergency
aid in exchange for closer budget supervision.  The yield limit may also help contain the Treasury’s own
interest-payments bill, the people said. Overspending in the
regions was among the major reasons cited by rating companies
for downgrading Spain last year.  Financing Need  UBS AG calculates the Treasury faces its highest borrowing
needs since 2005, with 121.3 billion euros of gross mid- and
long-term issuance planned for 2013. That includes 23 billion
euros for the FLA, up from around 17 billion euros last year, as
Rajoy has pledged to prevent any regional default.  The region of Madrid is pressuring the government to allow
it to return to debt markets to meet its 2013 funding
requirements. It reached its authorized limit of 2.3 billion
euros in January when it sold bonds with spreads of 190 basis
points to 203 basis points.  Madrid’s 1 billion euros of 5.75 percent bonds due 2018
trade at 90 basis points more than sovereign debt, compared with
a spread of 190 basis points when the notes where sold on Jan.
23, Bloomberg data show.  The Basque Country’s 700 million euros of 4.15 percent
bonds due 2019 trade at 105 basis points more than similar-
maturity government securities, according to Bloomberg data.
That compares with a spread as high as 459 basis points in
October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
