Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai retreated amid concerns that recent gains in home
prices could trigger new property curbs, reducing demand for the
building material.  Rebar for delivery in October fell 0.4 percent to close at
4,171 yuan ($669) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and has dropped 2.4 percent this week as investors returned to
the market after the Lunar New Year holiday last week.  China may increase borrowing costs and a down-payment
requirement for second-home buyers, the Shanghai Daily reported
today, citing an unidentified banking official. The Beijing
municipal government will hold a meeting tomorrow with
developers to discuss the property market and possible
tightening policies, the Shanghai Securities News reported,
citing an unidentified person from the local housing commission.  “Concerns about possible controls in the property market
resurfaced and it is always a negative influence on the rebar
market,” Zheng Ge, analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said by phone
from Beijing today.  The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed at
3,881 yuan today and has gained 2.4 percent this week, according
to Beijing Antaike data. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose 0.5
percent to $158 a dry ton yesterday, according to The Steel
Index Ltd., extending this week’s advance to 1.9 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
