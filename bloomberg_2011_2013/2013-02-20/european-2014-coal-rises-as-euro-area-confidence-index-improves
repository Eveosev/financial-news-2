European coal for next year rose for
the third day as euro-area consumer confidence increased to the
highest in seven months in February.  Thermal coal for delivery in 2014 to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp gained 20 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $99.30 a metric
ton at 3:40 p.m. London time, according to broker data compiled
by Bloomberg.  An index of household confidence in the currency bloc rose
to minus 23.6 from minus 23.9 in January, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today.  Bloomberg tracks broker data from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
