Vietnam’s dong weakened to an
October low on speculation importer demand for dollars increased
to pay overseas suppliers. Five-year bonds were steady.  The dong fell 0.2 percent to 20,890 per dollar at the close
in Hanoi, the lowest level since Oct. 8, according to prices
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank fixed the
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  “Companies are buying more dollars these days to pay
overseas suppliers as contracts become due,” said Nguyen Hong
Ha, a Hanoi-based currency trader at Vietnam International Bank.  Authorities won’t lift the dong’s reference rate “now”
due to inflation concerns, Gafin newswire reported today, citing
Nguyen Thi Hong, the central bank’s head of monetary policy.
Month-on-month inflation may accelerate in February from 1.25
percent in January, she said, according to Gafin. The dong
traded at around 21,100 per dollar today in the so-called black
market, Gafin reported.  The yield on the benchmark five-year government bonds was
unchanged at 9.20 percent, according to a daily fixing from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
