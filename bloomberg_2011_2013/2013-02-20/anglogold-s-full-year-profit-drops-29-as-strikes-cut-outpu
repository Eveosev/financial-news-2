AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the world’s
third-biggest producer of the metal, said profit fell 29 percent
in 2012, missing analysts’ estimates, after a strike that shut
its South African mines cut production.  Adjusted earnings excluding one-time items dropped to $924
million, or $2.39 per share last year compared with $1.3
billion, or $3.36 per share 12 months earlier, the Johannesburg-
based company said in a statement today. That compares with the
$3.03  median prediction  of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Pay strikes that started in the platinum industry in August
spread to gold, coal and chrome producers last year, cutting
mining output by 10.1 billion rand ($1.1 billion), according to
South Africa’s National Treasury. AngloGold, which mines about a
third of its metal in the country, retains the option of placing
these assets into a separate company should investors undervalue
the business, Chief Executive Officer  Mark Cutifani  said on Nov.
21.  “The weaker performance in earnings, cash flow largely
reflects challenges at South Africa operations through course of
year including several safety-related stoppages in the first
half and the unprotected  strike action  in the second half,” the
company said.  AngloGold, whose largest overseas competitors are  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  and  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , said gold production fell
17 percent to 859,000 ounces in the quarter compared with the
prior three months. It produced 3.94 million ounces for the
year, missing its target of 4.3 to 4.4 million ounces.  Total cash costs per ounce rose 14 percent to $1,009, it
said.  Output at all of its South African mines halted because of
work stoppages, spurring the company to cut its third-quarter
dividend in half and trim annual spending plans by $200 million.  The company will pay a dividend of 0.50 rand a share for
the fourth quarter matching the payout in the previous three
months, it said.  Cutifani is leaving AngloGold to replace  Cynthia Carroll  as
CEO of  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  on April 3.  Profit for the fourth quarter dropped $0.02 a share from
$0.61 in the previous quarter, That compares with the 47-cent
 median estimate  of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Gold
analysts in South Africa compare quarters sequentially.  To contact the reporter on this story:
