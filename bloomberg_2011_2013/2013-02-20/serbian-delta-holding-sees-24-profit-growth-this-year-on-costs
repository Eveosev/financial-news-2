Delta Holding DOO , owned by Serbia’s
richest man  Miroslav Miskovic , expects to boost profit 24
percent this year as the company with interest in insurance,
agriculture and property development is seeking to cut costs.  “The existing business structure” and “cost
optimization” will enable the company to grow this year, acting
Chairman Dejan Jeremic told reporters in Belgrade today. Revenue
this year will probably increase 11 percent, he said.  Sales fell 37 percent to 630.5 million euros ($841 million)
in 2012 from a year earlier while earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to 49.4 million euros
from 39.4 million euros in 2011, Jeremic said.  Delta’s 2011 figures included income from the sale of
retail chain Delta Maxi to Delhaize Group SA for 932.5 million
euros.  The company, which runs the Delta City shopping mall in
Belgrade, is Serbia’s biggest private employer with about 7,000
people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
