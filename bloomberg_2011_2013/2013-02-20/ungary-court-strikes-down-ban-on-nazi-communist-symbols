Hungary’s Constitutional Court
struck down a ban on Nazi and communist symbols, saying that the
law prohibiting them was “too general and insufficiently
clear.”  At the same time, the justices affirmed that a ban on
symbols of dictatorships would be in line with values enshrined
in Hungary’s Constitution and can be justified on the grounds of
violating human dignity, according to the ruling posted
yesterday on court’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
