The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose to a three-
month high before the release of U.S. leading indicators and a
regional manufacturing gauge that may add to evidence a recovery
in the world’s largest economy is gathering pace.  The U.S. currency gained versus most of its 16 major
counterparts after minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s January
meeting released yesterday showed several policy makers
advocated varying the pace of bond purchases. The  euro  fell for
a second day before data that economists say will show
manufacturing and services industries shrank in the currency
bloc. The pound weakened to a 2 1/2-year low against the dollar.  “Dollar strength is gradually gaining momentum,” said
 Marito Ueda , senior managing director in  Tokyo  at  FX Prime
Corp. (8711) , a currency-margin company. “There are clearer signs of a
U.S. economic recovery.”  The  Dollar Index , which IntercontinentalExchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback versus the currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, gained 0.1 percent to 81.107 at 7:52 a.m. in  London 
after rising to 81.279, the highest level since Nov. 16.  The euro fell 0.2 percent to $1.3265 after dropping 0.8
percent yesterday. The common currency declined 0.2 percent to
123.03 yen. The yen rose 0.1 percent to 93.46 per dollar.  The Conference Board’s index of U.S. leading indicators
rose 0.2 percent in January, after gaining 0.5 percent in
December according to a Bloomberg News survey before today’s
report. A Fed report on  manufacturing  in the Philadelphia area
is projected to show a rebound, a separate survey showed.  Europe’s Economy  Euro-area manufacturing and services industries probably
contracted in February, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists. The  manufacturing  purchasing managers index is
projected to be 48.5 compared with 47.9 in January, and the
 services  PMI may be 49 from 48.6 a month earlier. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  The dollar strengthened 1.6 percent this year, while the
euro rose 2.3 percent, according to Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-market currencies. The
yen was the worst performer, sliding 6.6 percent.  Sterling dropped 0.3 percent to $1.5195 after declining to
$1.5132, the weakest since July 2010. Against the euro, it fell
0.2 percent to 87.36 pence.  To contact the reporters on this story:
