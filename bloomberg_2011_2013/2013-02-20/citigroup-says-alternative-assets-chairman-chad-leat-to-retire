Citigroup Inc. , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, said that fixed-income veteran  Chad Leat  will retire
after 16 years at the lender.  Leat, 56, was chairman of Citigroup’s Alternative Assets
Group, which advises private-equity firms on leveraged buyouts.
He will help with an “orderly transition,”  Raymond J. McGuire ,
head of the bank’s advisory business, said in a memo to
employees.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos , a spokeswoman for the New
York-based lender, confirmed the memo’s contents.  In 2006 and 2007, Leat was co-head of global credit
markets, helping to oversee businesses including structured
finance, according to a Citigroup biography. He was responsible
for turning the bank’s leveraged-finance business into one of
the biggest in the world, according to the biography.  Leveraged buyouts are acquisitions that rely on borrowing.
Leat’s clients included private-equity firms KKR & Co.,
Blackstone Group LP, TPG Capital and  Apollo Global Management
LLC , according to the biography. Such companies pool money from
investors including pension plans and endowments with a mandate
to buy businesses within five to six years, then sell them and
return the funds with a profit after about 10 years.  Leat, who has a bachelor’s degree from the University of
Kansas, is a member of the Economics Club of New York and a
director of the Hampton Classic Horse Show, according to the
biography.  The Wall Street Journal reported Leat’s retirement earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
