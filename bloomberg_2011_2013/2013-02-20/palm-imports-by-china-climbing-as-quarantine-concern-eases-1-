Palm oil  imports  by China, the
biggest cooking oil consumer, may jump 14 percent in February on
optimism stricter quarantine inspections won’t hurt trade.  Shipments will probably rise to as much as 400,000 metric
tons from about 350,000 tons in January, the median of a survey
of four researchers and one trader shows. That compares with
384,000 tons in February last year, customs figures show.  Increased purchases by China, the largest buyer after
India, may extend a 5.5 percent advance in futures this year on
the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, the global benchmark. Tougher
inspections on cooking oils from Jan. 1 to improve food safety
raised concerns imports would decline. While seasonal demand and
buying before an export tax change in Malaysia may boost
deliveries, high inventories will probably cause a drop in full-
year imports, according to the survey.  “Traders have stepped up purchases, anticipating increased
spring demand and a tax hike in Malaysia,” said  Cao Huimin , an
analyst at China Cereals & Oils Business Net, a Beijing-based
cooking oil researcher. There have been no reports of shipments
being rejected for quality, she said.  Palm for May delivery gained 0.2 percent to 2,570 ringgit
($830) a ton in Kuala Lumpur today. Futures on the Dalian
Commodity Exchange in China were little changed at 7,124 yuan
($1,142) a ton, taking their gain to 2.9 percent this year.  Malaysia, the second-biggest supplier, raised the duty for
crude palm exports to 4.5 percent in March from zero in January
and February, a statement on the Palm Oil Board website said on
Feb. 15. Indonesia, the top producer, may keep its duty at 9
percent in March, according to the country’s palm association.  Spring Approaching  China’s purchases may expand as concern eases over the
quarantine controls and as spring approaches, Desmond Ng, China
manager for the Malaysian Palm Oil Council, said from Shanghai.  The pace of growth is limited by storage capacity, Ng said.
Inventory at major ports totaled 1.09 million tons, 30,000 tons
less than at the start of the month, Grain.gov.cn said in a
report yesterday. Stockpiles had declined gradually from a
record, it said. Inventories rose in December as buyers got in
before the quarantine changes, Cao of China Cereals said.  Imports were a record 954,087 tons in December, according
to China customs data.  Indonesia  supplied 454,492 tons and
 Malaysia  shipped 488,756 tons, they show.  Purchases for the full year may fall 6 percent from about
6.4 million tons in 2012, the survey showed. Shipments last year
were the highest since 2009, customs numbers show.  Annual growth in  cooking oil  consumption will probably
moderate over the next five years to 2 percent from 3 percent in
2007-2012 as there has already been a large shift by the middle
class to diets higher in fats and protein, Chen Xuecong, vice
president of Sinograin Oils Corp., said in November.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
