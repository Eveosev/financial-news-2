Yields on 10-year municipal bonds
rose to the highest level in six months as U.S. state and local
governments prepare for a $1.2 trillion automatic federal budget
reduction.  The  interest rate  on benchmark AAA munis maturing in 10
years jumped by 0.03 percentage point to 1.88 percent at 4 p.m.
in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the
biggest increase for the tax-exempt securities in two weeks and
the highest yield since August, the data show.  Yields also increased this week to the most since Feb. 13
on taxable Build America Bonds, rising to 4.43 percent on Feb.
19, according to Bloomberg data.  The  Build America Bonds  program, which gives states and
cities a 35 percent subsidy on interest, is among hundreds
facing reductions as a result of legislation passed in 2011 to
shrink the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion over a decade.
Congress delayed them until March 1. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration has said the payments would drop by $255 million,
or 7.6 percent, unless Congress averts the reductions.  Investors are “concerned with the potential for deficits
at the state and local level,” said  David Manges , muni trading
manager at BNY Mellon Capital Markets LLC in Pittsburgh. “The
sequester is going to draw money away from municipalities,
specifically in the BABs program, but arguably in other ways as
well.”  North Carolina  sold about $697 million in AAA rated
general-obligations today, with some 10-year debt priced to
yield 2.03 percent, Bloomberg data show. States and localities
are set to issue about $6.6 billion this week, the most since
the period ended Feb. 1, the  data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
