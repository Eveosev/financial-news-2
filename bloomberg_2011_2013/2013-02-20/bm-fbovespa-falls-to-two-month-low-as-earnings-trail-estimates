BM&FBovespa SA , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, fell to a ten-week
low after reporting a fourth-quarter profit that trailed
analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 2.8 percent to 13.15 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Dec. 7. Trading volume
was 2.3 times the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The  Bovespa  index declined 2 percent.  Fourth-quarter adjusted net income rose 7.6 percent to
379.4 million reais ($193.4 million) from the same period a year
earlier, the company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. The
average  estimate  of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a
profit of 396.2 million reais. Expenses rose 46.5 percent from
the previous quarter to 256 million reais as costs related to
health benefits to employees climbed.  “Although impacted by non-recurring items, expenses were
the main negative highlight,”  Francisco Kops , an analyst at
Banco J. Safra in Sao Paulo, wrote in a note to clients. “We
expect a negative reaction on shares.”  BM&FBovespa has climbed 12 percent in the past year while
the Bovespa benchmark index has fallen 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
