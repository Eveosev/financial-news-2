BlackBerry , the Canadian smartphone
maker, will unveil its new BlackBerry 10 devices tomorrow in
Germany and Italy, two of Europe’s biggest handset markets, as
the company looks to revive slumping sales.  The phones, including the flagship Z10 touch-screen model,
will be shown at events in Milan and Cologne, Germany, said
Rebecca Freiburger, a spokeswoman for the Waterloo, Ontario-
based company. Pricing and availability are expected to be
announced at that time.  BlackBerry is counting on positive reviews for its new
operating system to translate into a return to growth in western
Europe, where it has lost ground to  Apple Inc .’s iPhone and
Android handset makers led by  Samsung Electronics Co.  The
company shipped 1.78 million BlackBerrys in western Europe in
the fourth quarter, down from 3.36 million a year earlier,
according to IDC.  The Z10 went on sale in the U.K. on Jan. 31 and in Canada
on Feb. 5. The device will debut in Mumbai on Feb. 25, when
pricing details and availability will be announced.  Still, investors are more focused on the rollout of the new
models in the U.S., which remains BlackBerry’s biggest source of
revenue. The Z10 isn’t due in that country until March.  BlackBerry’s sales in developing markets have held up
better than in North America and Europe, though revenue is down
globally. Sales from Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. fell 53
percent last quarter from a year earlier. Revenue from the rest
of the world, including India, dropped 44 percent.  BlackBerry fell 4.5 percent to $13.71 at the close in New
York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year, while the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has risen 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
