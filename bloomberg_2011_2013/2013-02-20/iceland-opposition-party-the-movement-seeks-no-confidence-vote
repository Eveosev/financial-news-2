Iceland’s opposition party The
Movement will seek a no confidence vote in the ruling minority
government for its failure to bring about constitutional reform,
party lawmaker Thor Saari told parliament, the Reykjavik-based
assembly’s website said today.  Saari said he wants parliament to be suspended on Feb. 28
and a caretaker government composed of members of all of
Iceland’s political parties to take over until parliamentary
elections on April 13. He had earlier suggested the election
could take place two weeks later than that. Parliament will vote
on Saari’s motion on Feb. 26, according to Saari’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
