U.S. officials said they will put
diplomatic pressure on countries implicated in thefts of trade
secrets and seek stronger international enforcement of
intellectual-property protections.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration pledged to share
more intelligence with companies about the nations involved in
economic espionage and methods used to steal corporate
information, and to study the need for stronger U.S. laws
against trade-secret theft.  “We will act vigorously to combat the theft of U.S. trade
secrets that could be used by foreign companies or by foreign
governments to gain an unfair economic edge,”  Victoria Espinel ,
the U.S. intellectual property enforcement coordinator, told
reporters today. “It will be very clear to those countries that
this is a top priority for the United States.”  The administration’s announcement comes a day after the
computer-security firm Mandiant Corp. said in a  report  that the
Chinese army is probably the source of hacking attacks against
at least 141 companies worldwide since 2006.  The trade-secret strategy looks at more than computer-based
theft. In a report today, the administration said the pace of
economic espionage is accelerating through recruitment of
current and former employees of companies, as well as cyber
intrusions against U.S. businesses, law firms, universities and
financial institutions.  Economic Jeopardy  While it doesn’t single out China, today’s report cites
examples of economic espionage in which corporate secrets were
passed to Chinese institutions.  “Trade secret theft threatens American businesses,
undermines national security, and places the security of the
U.S. economy in jeopardy,” according to the document. “These
acts also diminish U.S. export prospects around the globe and
put American jobs at risk.”  The administration will intensify efforts to apply
diplomatic pressure on countries “where there are regular
incidents of trade secret theft” and press them to strengthen
enforcement action, according to the strategy document. In trade
negotiations, the U.S. will seek agreements for other countries
to provide protections for corporate secrets similar to those in
U.S. law.  Espionage, Technology  The Director of National Intelligence will oversee
increased sharing of U.S. intelligence on trade-secret theft
with the private sector, including information on foreign
governments involved in espionage and the types of technology
targeted, the document says.  The administration will promote voluntary industry best
practices on protecting intellectual property, and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation is expanding efforts to fight computer
intrusions involving trade-secret theft, according to the
administration’s strategy.  “As new technologies have torn down traditional barriers
to international business and global commerce, they’ve also made
it easier for criminals to steal trade secrets and to do so from
anywhere in the world,” U.S. Attorney General  Eric Holder  said.  “A hacker in China can acquire source code from a software
company in Virginia without leaving his or her desk,” Holder
said. “With a few keystrokes, a terminated or simply unhappy
employee from a defense contractor can misappropriate designs,
processes and formulas worth billions of dollars.”  ‘Government Sponsored’  Cyber espionage is invisible, making it difficult for
government to combat, James Garland, a partner at Covington &
Burling LLP in Washington and a former Justice Department
official under Holder, said in an interview.  “The fact that our government is talking openly about this
is a good sign that the administration is raising the
temperature on this, especially with China,” Garland said.  The Mandiant report released yesterday said computer
intrusions from China, mainly directed at U.S. companies, were
carried out by a group “likely government sponsored” and
similar “in its mission, capabilities, and resources” to a
unit of the People’s Liberation Army.  A spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry,  Hong Lei , denied
any military involvement and said his department is opposed to
computer hacking and has been a victim of attacks itself.  Obama issued an executive order Feb. 12 calling for
increased government sharing of information on cyber threats
with industry. It directs the government to develop voluntary
cybersecurity standards for companies operating vital
infrastructure such as power grids and air-traffic control
systems.  A recently prepared U.S. secret intelligence assessment,
described Feb. 11 in the Washington Post, said the country’s
economy is endangered by a massive and prolonged computer-
espionage campaign from China.  To contact the reporters on this story:
