China should encourage people and
groups attacked by U.S.-based hackers to speak up about what
happened to them, the state-run Global Times newspaper said in
an editorial today.  China’s responses so far to accusations that hacker attacks
on the U.S. originated within its borders have been limited to
officials, the newspaper said. The government should encourage
society to fight back, it said.  The editorial appeared a day after U.S. security firm
Mandiant Corp. released a report saying China’s army may be
behind a computer-hacking group that has attacked at least 141
companies worldwide since 2006.  China should have technical departments rebut the
accusations, the Global Times said. Speaking at a briefing
yesterday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said China
opposes hacking and is itself a victim of such actions. The
Ministry of Defense said in a fax to Bloomberg News that it’s
“inaccurate and unprofessional to accuse the Chinese military
of Internet attacks.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
