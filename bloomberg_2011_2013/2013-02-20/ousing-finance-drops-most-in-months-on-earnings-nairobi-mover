Housing Finance Ltd. , Kenya’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, dropped the most in a month
after saying pretax profit slid 7 percent last year.  The shares fell 3 percent to 19.40 shillings by the 3 p.m.
close in Nairobi, the biggest decline since Jan. 21, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 229,300 shares changed
hands, or 173 percent of the three-month daily average.  Pretax profit  retreated to 907.6 million shillings ($10.4
million) from 975.8 million shillings a year earlier as interest
expenses doubled to 3.12 billion shillings, the company said
yesterday. Net interest income, the money lenders earn from
interest charges on loans, increased to 1.95 billion shillings
from 1.9 billion shillings.  “As expected the high interest rate regime in first-half
2012 would eat into their net interest income as interest
expenses grew,”  Ted Macharia , a research analyst at Nairobi-
based AIB Capital Ltd., said today in an e-mailed note to
clients. “This growth coupled with an increase in operation
expenses would eat into their profit before tax even after
interest income grew.”  The Central Bank of Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee left
the benchmark rate unchanged at 18 percent during all five of
its meetings in the first half of 2012. The committee has since
cut the rate four times to 9.5 percent.  Profit after tax grew 19 percent to 743.3 million shillings
after Housing Finance sought deferral of tax following the
revival of Kenya Building Society. The unit was dormant for 13
years. The effective tax rate fell by half to 18 percent,
Managing Director  Frank Ireri  told reporters in Nairobi today.  “The deferred tax was the shocker that boosted profit
after tax,” Macharia said in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
