Germany’s  Bundesbank  said it has
completed the sale of assets it inherited after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and hopes to escape without a loss
once insolvency proceedings are resolved.  Of the 8.5 billion euros ($11.4 billion) in loans that
Lehman defaulted on, the Bundesbank has recouped 7.4 billion
euros through selling the collateral, board member  Joachim Nagel 
said in Frankfurt today. With some 800 million euros in interest
and costs also owed, a total of 1.9 billion euros remains
outstanding. Nagel said 760 million euros of that has already
been secured and the Bundesbank is optimistic it will recover
the full amount through insolvency proceedings in Germany and
the U.S.  “It’s not about making a profit, but about completely
realizing the outstanding claims,” he said.  Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG, the German arm of the defunct
U.S. bank, borrowed 8.5 billion euros from the European Central
Bank via the Bundesbank in 2008. As collateral, Lehman deposited
33 securities with the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and
the national central banks of euro-area member states, 32 of
which were asset-backed structures.  The Bundesbank is acting on behalf of the Eurosystem to
dispose of the assets and pursue claims through insolvency
proceedings. If at the close of those proceedings a loss is
sustained, it will be shared by the central banks of the euro
area, the Bundesbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
