Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures slid 1.9 percent, propelled by speculation
that a commodity fund was liquidating positions.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 22.65 percent on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 4:10 p.m., compared with 19.54 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell $1.88
to settle at $95.22 a barrel on the Nymex.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
April $90 puts, which rose 35 cents to 79 cents a barrel on
volume of 5,039 contracts at 4:23 p.m. in New York. April $105
calls were the second-most active with 3,473 lots. They declined
4 cents to 6 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 66 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the previous session, bearish bets made up 56 percent of the
111,607 contracts traded.  April $90 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 4,228 contracts changing hands. They were down
11 cents to 44 cents. April $80 puts declined 3 cents to 5 cents
