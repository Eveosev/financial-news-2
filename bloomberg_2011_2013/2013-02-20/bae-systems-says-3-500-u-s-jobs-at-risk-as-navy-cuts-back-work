BAE Systems Plc  said it may be
forced to dismiss more than 3,500 employees in its U.S.
shipbuilding business as Pentagon spending cuts threaten
maintenance work on navy vessels.  Four locations and about 70 percent of U.S. staff involved
in ship repair work may be affected, the London-based company
said in an e-mailed statement. Facilities in Norfolk, Virginia
and San Diego, California would be hit most severely, with cuts
also possible in Hawaii and Mayport, Florida, BAE said.  The U.S. Navy has told BAE Systems that work on 13 ships
may be affected as it scales back spending to bring activities
in line with a reduced budget. The company said the risk of
possible work cancellation prompted it to issue conditional
worker adjustment and retraining notification notices required
before laying off employees.  “We do not take these decisions lightly, and we regret the
anxiety it causes our employees and their families,”   Bill Clifford , president of BAE Systems Ship Repair, said in a notice
to employees that was obtained by Bloomberg. Suppliers could
also be affected, BAE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
