Aon Plc , the world’s second-largest
insurance broker by market value, agreed to sell Aon Zimbabwe
Ltd. after the unit’s license was revoked by the African nation.  Aon Zimbabwe has been operating in the country for 66
years, making it the global brokerage’s oldest unit in Sub-
Sahara Africa, the London-based parent company said today in a
statement.  Zimbabwe’s two opposing political parties agreed last month
on a new draft constitution that would allow President  Robert Mugabe , 88, to try to extend his 33-year rule for another
decade. Mugabe’s party has threatened to nationalize foreign-
owned assets and pushed for a law that would require companies
to sell 51 percent of their local assets to black Zimbabweans.  “Aon Plc has made a decision to sell its entire
shareholding to a local entity,” Anton Roux, chief executive
officer of Aon South Africa and Sub-Sahara Africa, said in the
statement.  Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed. Aon said it will
retain a presence in Zimbabwe to assist the new entity with
technical expertise and resources “to ensure that the business
will continue.”  Attempts to reach a represenative of Zimbabwe for comment
by phone at the nation’s embassy in Washington weren’t
immediately succesful.  To contact the reporter on this story:
