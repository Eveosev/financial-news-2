The 200-day moving average for
Treasury 10-year  yields  is leveling out after falling for 18
months, indicating the decline in rates is losing momentum,
according to Mirae Asset Global Investments Co.  Ten-year yields held at 2.03 percent as of 7:41 a.m. in
London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 200-day
average was 1.71 percent, little changed for almost four weeks.
Before that, it tumbled from 3.17 percent in August 2011.  “There is bearish momentum in the Treasury market,” said
 Will Tseng , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Mirae Asset,
which oversees $50 billion. “The long-term moving average has
changed from a downward trend to flat. It won’t be a big jump,
but it will be a slow upward trend” in yields, he said.  Benchmark 10-year rates have climbed 26 basis points, or
0.26 percentage points, this year. The broad market has handed
investors a 1 percent loss in 2013, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes.  The rate will climb to 2.32 percent by Dec. 31, based on a
Bloomberg survey of economists, with the most recent projections
given the heaviest weightings. For an investor who buys today,
the move would result in a 0.7 percent loss after accounting for
interest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
