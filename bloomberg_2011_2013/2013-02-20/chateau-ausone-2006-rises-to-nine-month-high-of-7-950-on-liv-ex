The 2006 vintage of Saint-Emilion
wine producer  Chateau Ausone  traded at a nine-month high of
5,200 pounds ($7,950) a case on the London-based  Liv-ex  wine
market this week, according to data on its Cellar Watch website.  The price was 13 percent up from a transaction on Jan. 23,
although below the $9,225 fetched for the same vintage at an
