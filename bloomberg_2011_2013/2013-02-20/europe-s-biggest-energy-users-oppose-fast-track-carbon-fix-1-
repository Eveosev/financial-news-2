The biggest energy users among
European companies urged lawmakers in a letter today to avoid
fast-track approval of a proposal to tackle a record oversupply
of carbon permits that has divided policy makers.  The European Parliament’s environment committee yesterday
delayed a decision on whether to start accelerated talks with
European Union governments on a law change that would enable
curbing a glut of emission permits that pushed prices to a
record low. The negotiations should start only after a debate in
the full Parliament, the Alliance of Energy Intensive
Industries, which represents companies including  ArcelorMittal (MT) ,
said in the letter obtained by  Bloomberg News .  At stake is the EU’s 54 billion-euro ($72 billion) cap-and-
trade system, which imposes emission limits on about 12,000
power plants and factories in industries ranging from paper to
steel. The benchmark carbon contract slumped from an all-time
high of 31 euros a metric ton in 2006 to as low as 2.81 euros
last month, a price the European Commission said was too low to
stimulate green investment.  “The plenary debate, followed by a vote, would allow all
members of the European Parliament to express their views and
provide required political support for the final decision,” the
AEII said in the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
