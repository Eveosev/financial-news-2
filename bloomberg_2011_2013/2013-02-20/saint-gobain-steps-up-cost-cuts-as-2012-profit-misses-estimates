Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA , Europe’s
biggest supplier of building materials, said it will step up
cost cuts this year after 2012 earnings missed analysts’
estimates amid Europe’s economic woes.  The company will slash costs by 580 million euros ($774
million) in 2013 after 520 million euros last year, Saint-
Gobain, based in Courbevoie near Paris, said in a statement
today. Net income fell 40 percent to 766 million euros last
year. The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a profit of 1.07 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer  Pierre-Andre de Chalendar  decided
in July to step up cost cuts, reduce investment and put new
acquisitions on hold to adjust to the European car and
construction slump that has hit sales and prices of flat glass.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its U.S. glass-bottle
business for $1.7 billion to strengthen its balance sheet and
focus expansion plans on building products.  “For 2013, we’re expecting a pickup in our earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the second
half after a low point in the second half of 2012 or in the
first half of 2013,” the CEO said in the statement.  Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s, which rate
Saint-Gobain at Baa2 and BBB respectively, have said they may
downgrade the French company.  In 2012, the company’s Ebitda fell 16 percent to 2.88
billion euros as revenue rose 2.6 percent to 43.2 billion euros.  Saint-Gobain will propose to pay a dividend of 1.24 euros
per share this year, unchanged from last year.  The company’s shares have fallen 2.5 percent this year,
giving it a market value of 16.7 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
