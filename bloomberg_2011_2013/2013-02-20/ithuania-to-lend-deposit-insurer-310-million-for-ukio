Lithuania’s government agreed to
lend as much as 800 million litai ($310 million) to help the
state deposit insurance fund meet obligations related to
insolvent lender  Ukio Bankas AB .  The money will help finance the transfer of some of Ukio’s
assets to  Siauliu Bankas AB , avoiding a larger payout to
depositors of 2.7 billion litai due if Ukio is liquidated, the
government said today in an e-mailed statement from the capital,
Vilnius. The loan, due Feb. 1, 2019, will have an interest rate
of 2.801 percent, according to the statement.  Finance Minister Rimantas Sadzius said yesterday that the
loan would be between 500 million litai and 600 million litai.
Its exact size will depend on details of the asset sale that
Ukio’s administrator is negotiating with Siauliu, the government
said.  Lithuania’s central bank revoked Ukio’s license on Feb. 18,
saying the lender’s liabilities exceeded its assets, some of
which Siauliu is seeking to buy. The country’s deposit insurer
is “rather empty” following the 2011 bankruptcy of Bankas
Snoras AB, Sadzius said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
