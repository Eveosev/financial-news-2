Goodman Group , Australiaâ€™s biggest
industrial property trust, reported a 23 percent drop in first-
half profit as property valuations weakened.  Net income  fell to A$154.6 million ($159 million) in the
six months ended Dec. 31, compared with A$200 million a year
earlier, the Sydney-based company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange. Operating profit rose 16 percent to
A$265.7 million, it said.  Goodman will pay a  dividend  of 9.7 Australian cents for the
half, it said. The company forecast full-year operating earnings
of 32.3 cents a share, up 6 percent from the previous year.  Goodman, which is seeking to expand its global operations,
in November announced a Brazilian logistics partnership with Sao
Paulo-based WTorre Properties SA, and in August said it had
formed a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board to develop and buy warehouses in North America. The group
will continue to expand at home, with plans to begin A$451
million of warehouse and office investments, the company said
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
