National Football League players
don’t trust Commissioner  Roger Goodell , affecting talks on
issues such as testing for human growth hormone, according to
union president  Domonique Foxworth .  Foxworth said it’s hard to get things done when incidents
such as the fight between the NFL Players Association and the
league over the New Orleans Saints bounty case have fractured
trust.  “If I wanted to get them to trust Roger, I couldn’t,”
Foxworth said yesterday on a conference call with reporters.
“There was a bridge beginning to be built, and then there were
some recent events that kind of broke that bridge again.”  Foxworth’s comments come in advance of meetings between the
league and union at the NFL Scouting Combine, which is set for
Feb. 23-26 in Indianapolis. Foxworth said a neutral arbitrator
might improve relations.  NFL spokesman  Greg Aiello  said in an e-mail that the union
“has consistently looked backwards” on issues such as
discipline and growth hormone testing.  “Trust is a two-way street,” he said. “If the union
wants to work together to build a better, safer and even more
popular game, we extend our hand in partnership and respect. If
the union wants to stir up old grievances and create mistrust,
we will simply have to do the best we can to serve the interests
of the fans, players and the game.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
