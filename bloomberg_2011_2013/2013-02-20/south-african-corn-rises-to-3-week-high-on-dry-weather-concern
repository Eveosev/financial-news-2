South African corn futures rose to
the highest level in more than three weeks as the continued lack
of rain raises concern about the harvest.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
rose 1.1 percent to 2,057 rand ($232) a metric ton, the highest
since Jan. 29, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in the
same month gained 1 percent to 2,055 rand a ton.  There is  no rain  predicted until Feb. 25 for Bothaville in
the Free State, where 40 percent of the nation’s corn is
produced, according to the South African Weather Service’s
website.  “The lack of rain situation continues to pose a threat,”
 Andrew Fletcher , an independent trader, said by phone from
Kroonstad in the Free State province. “The market is now
looking at production factors and that is taking the price up.”  A median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News showed that farmers may increase corn output by 5.9 percent
to 12.5 million tons this season from a year earlier. The Crop
Estimates Committee will release its data on Feb. 26.  South Africa is the largest corn producer on the continent.
Meal made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods
and the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for March delivery fell 1.2 percent to 3,446 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
