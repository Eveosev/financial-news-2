France, producer of champagne and
burgundy wines, favors keeping a common market organization for
wine in the European Union as the bloc reforms its farm policy,
Agriculture Minister  Stephane Le Foll  said.  The country doesn’t back a  proposal  by the European
Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, to switch to a fixed area
payment for vineyards as part of the new common agricultural
policy, Le Foll said at a press conference, following an
industry meeting at the Agriculture Ministry in Paris today.  “Keep a wine CMO rather than going to a system of a
payment per hectare,” Le Foll said. “How can we justify giving
an aid per hectare to the producers of Champagne” or other
grand cru wines, he said.  The EU’s existing wine-market organization allocates a
budget for the industry and allows for common-interest measures,
such as export promotion, which might disappear if every wine
grower gets an individual payment, according to Jerome Despey,
head of the wine board at crop office FranceAgriMer.  “We prefer to keep these structuring measures,” Despey
said at the press conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
