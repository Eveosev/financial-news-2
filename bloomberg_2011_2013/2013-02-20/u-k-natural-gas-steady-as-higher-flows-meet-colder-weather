U.K. natural gas for next-day
delivery advanced as freezing weather was forecast for the
following four days.  Month-ahead gas also climbed, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Average U.K. temperatures will fall to 0.2 degree
Celsius tomorrow (32 Fahrenheit) and minus 0.6 degree on Feb. 22
from 2.3 degrees today, according to MetraWeather data using the
ECMWF model.  Gas for tomorrow added 0.7 percent to 68 pence a therm at 5
p.m. London time.  Next-month gas  rose 0.5 percent to 66.3 pence
a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.14 per million British thermal
units and compares with $3.28 per million Btu of front-month
U.S. gas.  “It will take some time for the cold air to filter across
the whole of the U.K. but by Friday, much of the U.K. will
struggle to see daytime temperatures above around 3 degrees,”
the Met Office said on its website. “Brisk winds across England
and Wales will make it feel much colder.”  Demand  in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 331
million cubic meters, the most since Feb. 13 and above the
seasonal normal of 308 million, National Grid Plc data show.  Flows from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported
gas, were at 116 million cubic meters a day compared with a 10-
day average of 112 million, Gassco AS data show. Imports from
 Belgium  were at 10 million cubic meters a day.  Gas accounted for 31 percent of U.K. power production at
4:55 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 40 percent, nuclear 17
percent and wind 5.9 percent.  Wind power  output will peak at 2,599 megawatts tomorrow
after reaching 3,046 megawatts today, according to Bloomberg
calculations. It touched a record 5,082 megawatts Feb. 3, grid
data show.  Electricity  for tomorrow jumped 2.6 percent to 51.80 pounds
a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
