Lithuania’s energy minister publicly
restated support for  Chevron Corp ’s plans to explore for shale
gas in the country following criticism of the project from a
parliamentary committee earlier this month.  Energy Minister  Jaroslav Neverovi c backed the project after
meeting today with the head of Chevron’s Lithuanian
representative office, the ministry in Vilnius said on its
website. A parliamentary committee on Feb. 6 called for a
moratorium on the project and an investigation into the local
company that is 50 percent-owned by Chevron.  Chevron, a U.S. energy company, last year bought 50 percent
of LL Investicijos and in January submitted the only bid in a
tender for shale-gas exploration rights in Lithuania. The Baltic
country wants to join Poland and Ukraine and lower energy costs
and dependence on Russian supplies by turning to shale gas.  “The government has committed itself to undertake shale-
gas exploration and, in the future, after suitable preparations,
to consider the issue of production,” Neverovic said. “We have
to support new innovative opportunities to reduce the cost of
the energy resources we consume.”  Investments by Chevron would also create jobs and give
Lithuania access to new technologies and other know-how,
Neverovic said.  Chevron has pledged to abide by the highest environmental
and safety standards in its work, and to engage in active dialog
with any social groups.  To contact the reporters on this story:
