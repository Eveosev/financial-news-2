SolarCity Corp. , the solar-power
provider led by billionaire Elon Musk, is partnering with  Honda
Motor Co.  to finance $65 million worth of rooftop projects for
car buyers and dealers.  Japan’s third-largest automaker will begin offering Honda
or Acura buyers living in SolarCity’s 14-state coverage area,
including California and New Jersey, a $400 discount toward a
residential system, Steven Center, a vice president at American
Honda Motor Co., said in an interview today. The partnership
also will deploy systems on as many as 20 dealerships.  “We’re trying to create the liquidity that will build the
solar market,” Center said. “We’ll probably run the course of
the program this year.” As many as 3,000 customers will qualify
for the discount, he said.  The agreement with Honda allows SolarCity, based in San
Mateo, California, to offer discounts to their customers, Chief
Executive Officer  Lyndon Rive  said.  “We can be a lot more aggressive with the price,” Rive
said in an interview.  SolarCity said last month that installations of rooftop
solar systems will climb to 250 megawatts this year, up from 156
megawatts in 2012.  This isn’t the first time an automaker has partnered with a
solar producer. In 2011, Ford Motor Co. and SunPower Corp., the
second-largest U.S. solar manufacturer, combined to offer solar
systems to Focus Electric drivers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
