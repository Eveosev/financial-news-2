Gunmen abducted six foreign oil
workers near the coast of Nigeria and demanded for a ransom to
free them, police said.  The attackers boarded a vessel belonging to  Century Group ,
a Lagos-based oil services company, on Feb. 17 and seized 3
Ukranians, 2 Indians and 1 Russian, Fidelis Odunna, police
spokesman for Bayelsa state in oil-rich Niger River delta, said
today by phone from the capital, Yenagoa.  While the kidnappers have demanded 200 million naira ($1.3
million) to free the hostages, security forces have launched
investigations to locate and free them, he said.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, has seen a renewed
surge of violence targeting the industry by armed groups that
either steal crude oil from pipelines or kidnap oil workers for
ransom. Attacks had declined after thousands of militants
fighting for a greater share of the region’s oil wealth for its
inhabitants, accepted a government amnesty in 2009 and disarmed.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc ,  Exxon Mobil Corp .,  Chevron Corp .,
 Total SA  and  Eni SpA  run joint ventures with state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. that pump more than 90 percent
of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
