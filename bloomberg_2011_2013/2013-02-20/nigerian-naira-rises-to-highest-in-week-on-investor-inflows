Nigeria’s naira appreciated for a
second day, reaching its highest in more than a week, as dollar
inflows into the nation’s fixed-income securities boosted
supply.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer gained less
than 0.1 percent to 157.28 per dollar by 3:30 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its strongest level on a closing basis since
Feb. 11.  Nigeria plans to sell 170.65 billion naira ($1.1 billion)
of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day treasury bills at an auction
today, the Central Bank of Nigeria said Feb. 13. The nation’s
one-year bill yield fell to the lowest in 16 months at a Feb. 6
sale, as offshore demand took bids to a record. The naira has
gained from inflows to oil companies investing in Nigeria’s
hydrocarbons and portfolio funds, Governor  Lamido Sanusi  said
Jan. 21.  “The naira is supported by dollar inflows from foreign
investors buying various local-currency debt securities,” Tunde
Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain
Investment Ltd., said by phone today. “Interest on the bills is
sustained following the release of lower headline inflation
figures.”  The nation’s  inflation  rate fell to 9 percent in January
from 12 percent in December, the lowest level since April 2008,
as the effect of a year-earlier reduction in fuel subsidies
dropped out of the calculation, the Abuja-based  National Bureau
of Statistics  said Feb. 18.  Currency Auction  The central bank sold $120 million at a foreign currency
auction today to support the naira, matching the previous sale
on Feb. 18, at 155.74 per dollar, it said in an e-mailed
statement.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined eight basis points to 10.41 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website.  Borrowing costs on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due
January 2021 fell two basis points to 4.385 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi declined for a third day, down 0.1 percent to
1.9045 per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
