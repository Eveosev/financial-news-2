German stocks  declined from their
highest level in two weeks as Deutsche Lufthansa AG slid and
housing starts in the U.S. fell in January more than forecast.  Lufthansa slumped the most in more than 15 months after
saying it will suspend its dividend for the first time since
2010. BASF SE and Bayer AG gained the most on the benchmark DAX
Index. HeidelbergCement AG rose to a 21-month high as peer
Lafarge SA reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  The  DAX Index  slipped 0.3 percent to 7,728.9 at the close
of trading in Frankfurt. The benchmark gauge has still advanced
1.5 percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
budget avoiding automatic fiscal changes that had threatened to
push the world’s biggest economy into recession. The broader
HDAX Index fell 0.2 percent today.  “The U.S. housing starts data is unwelcome bad news,”
Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG in London, said in a
telephone interview. “We thought housing was picking up in the
U.S. after a long time absent.”  Total  housing starts  in the U.S. dropped to an 890,000 rate
in January, less than forecast and restrained by a slump in
construction of multifamily units, according to Commerce
Department figures released today in Washington. Permits for
future construction rose.  The  median  estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected total housing starts would drop to a 920,000 annual
rate.  Lufthansa Dividend  Lufthansa  retreated 6.2 percent to 15 euros. Europe’s
second-biggest airline will suspend its dividend to preserve
cash as it rejuvenates its fleet and implements a cost-savings
program.  Lufthansa said net income last year reached 990 million
euros ($1.33 billion), compared with a year-earlier loss of 13
million euros, as it benefited from disposal gains. Revenue in
2012 rose to 30.1 billion euros from 28.7 billion euros,
Lufthansa said, citing preliminary figures.  EON SE  and  RWE AG , Germany’s two biggest utilities, dropped
2.2 percent to 12.88 euros and 1.8 percent to 27.84 euros,
respectively.  Bayer, the drugs and chemicals maker, gained 1.2 percent to
72.63 euros.  BASF , the world’s biggest chemical manufacturer,
added 0.5 percent to 74.12 euros, paring gains of as much as 1.4
percent.  HeidelbergCement , the world’s third-largest cement maker,
rose 1.8 percent to 51.26 euros, its highest since May 2011.
Lafarge, the biggest cement maker, said fourth-quarter earnings
beat estimates on rising sales in Asia and Latin America.  Adidas AG , the world’s second-biggest sporting-goods maker,
climbed 0.7 percent to 72.10 euros, a record high. Deutsche Bank
AG raised its forecast price on the shares to 81 euros from 70
euros, predicting a significant increase in earnings from the
second quarter of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
