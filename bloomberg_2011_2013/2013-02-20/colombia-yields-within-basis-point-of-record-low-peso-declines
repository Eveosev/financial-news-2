Colombia’s peso bond yields held
within a basis point of a record low on speculation the central
bank will reduce borrowing costs at its meeting this week.  Yields on Colombia’s securities due in 2024 were little
changed at 5.02 percent at 8:53 a.m. in Bogota, according to the
central bank. They fell to 5.01 percent on Feb. 15, the lowest
level on a closing basis since the bonds were issued in 2009.  Banco de la Republica will reduce the 4 percent target rate
by 0.25 percentage point on Feb. 22, according to 22 of 24
 economists  surveyed by Bloomberg. Two forecast the rate will
hold steady. Finance Minister Mauricio Cardenas said in an
interview on RCN Radio yesterday that the government wants lower
borrowing costs.  “The market has already priced in this week’s cut,”  Jorge Cardozo , an analyst at Corredores Asociados brokerage, said in a
phone interview from Bogota. “It has been difficult for the
2024 bonds to break the 5 percent level, but once the bank cuts
the rate, the yield should once again start ticking lower.”  Cardozo forecasts the central bank will lower the  overnight
lending rate  to 3.5 percent by March, pushing the yield on the
securities to 4.75 percent in the second quarter.  The peso was little changed, depreciating less than 0.1
percent to 1,791.70 per U.S. dollar. It has dropped 1.3 percent
this year as the government and central bank announced increased
dollar purchases to stem a rally that sent the peso to a 17-
month intraday high on Jan. 2.  Dollar Purchases  Cardenas said Feb. 13 that the government will buy $1
billion to pay for interest and principal on foreign bonds
coming due, helping to weaken the peso. The government said last
month that it would purchase the same amount for its oil
stability fund.  Banco de la Republica said Jan. 28 it will buy at least $30
million a day, boosting purchases in the foreign-exchange market
to $3 billion from February to May. A stronger peso curbs
exporters’ profits.  “The intervention has definitely had an impact,” Cardozo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
