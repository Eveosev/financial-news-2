Treasury 10-year note yields traded
close to the highest in 10 months on speculation Federal Reserve
minutes may provide details on when the central bank plans to
start trimming debt purchases.  Benchmark notes  fell earlier today as a report showed
builders broke ground in January on the most U.S. single-family
homes in more than four years and permits for future
construction rose, an indication the industry’s momentum carried
over into 2013. The difference between Treasury yields for two-
and 10-year securities widened to 1.77 percentage points, close
to the most since April.  “The Fed minutes is certainly the primary driver,” said
 Guy LeBas , chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia. “We’re looking for the Fed to talk a
little bit more about the downsides of their very expansionary
monetary policy. The short-term data will take second seat to
the Fed.”  The U.S. 10-year yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 1:27 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note
due in February 2023 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 28/32.  Yield Levels  The yield reached as much as 2.05 percent. It climbed to
2.06 percent on Feb. 14, the highest level since April 10. The
two-year yield was little changed at 0.26 percent.  Treasury market volatility, as measured by the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch MOVE index,  declined  to 58.4 yesterday
from 59.1 on Feb. 15 and compared with the 59.74 average since
the Fed announced $40 billion a month in mortgage purchases.  The 200-day moving average for 10-year yields is leveling
out after falling for 18 months, according to Mirae Asset Global
Investments Co. The 200-day average of 1.71 percent has been
little changed for almost four weeks after it tumbled from its
August 2011 level of 3.17 percent.  “There is bearish momentum in the Treasury market,” said
 Will Tseng , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Mirae Asset,
which oversees $50 billion. “The long-term moving average has
changed from a downward trend to flat. It won’t be a big jump,
but it will be a slow upward trend” in yields, he said.  Fed Reading  The Fed is scheduled to issue the minutes of its Jan. 29-30
meeting at 2 p.m. in Washington. The U.S. central bank said on
Jan. 30 it is committed to buying about $85 billion of
government and mortgage securities a month to support growth.
Minutes of the Fed’s Dec. 11-12 gathering showed members divided
between a mid- or end-of-year finish to bond purchases.  “As long as the data remains sustainable, the possibility
is going to become more real” that the central bank removes
some accommodation, said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe
General SA in New York, one of the 21 primary dealers that trade
with the Fed. “It does have the potential to break out” should
the market see the Fed minutes as hawkish.  Treasury 10-year yields have risen about 11 basis points
since the minutes from the FOMC Dec. 11-12 meeting, released on
Jan. 3, showed a divide among participants on how long the
purchases should continue. Those who provided estimates were
“approximately evenly divided” between participants who said
it would be appropriate to end the purchases around mid-2013 and
those who said they should continue beyond that date.  Fed Buys  The Fed bought $3.3 billion of Treasuries maturing from May
2020 to February 2023 today as part of its outright purchase
program to bolster the economy. The Fed Bank of New York said it
will test allowing “small broker-dealers” to act as
counterparties in sales and purchases of Treasuries for the
central bank’s portfolio.  Treasuries handed investors a 1 percent loss this year
through yesterday, after a 2.2 percent gain last year, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Wholesale prices in the U.S. rose in January for the first
time in four months, reflecting higher costs for food and
pharmaceuticals. The producer-price index climbed 0.2 percent
after a 0.3 percent drop in December, the Labor Department
reported today in Washington. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 74 economists projected a 0.3 percent increase.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and similar-
maturity Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the debt, was
2.56 percentage points. The average in the past decade is 2.20
percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
