Malaysia’s ringgit climbed for the
first time in three days before data today that is forecast to
show economic growth accelerated and inflation held at the
slowest pace since 2010. Government bonds declined.  Gross domestic product  increased 5.5 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, compared with 5.2 percent in the
preceding three months, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey before figures due at 6 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur.
 Consumer prices  rose 1.2 percent in January, matching December’s
34-month low, a separate Bloomberg survey showed. German
investor confidence climbed to the highest in almost three years,
an index released yesterday shows.  “The Malaysian currency is stronger because people are
expecting better GDP numbers to be released later today,”
said  Yeo Chin Tiong , head of financial markets at Alliance Bank
Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Asian currencies are firmer because of
the good data from Germany.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.4 percent to 3.0950 per dollar as
of 9:32 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, after losing 1 percent in the
first two days of the week, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 3.0915, near the 3.0780 level
reached last week that was the strongest since Jan. 31. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, held at 7.3 percent.  The yield on the 3.418 percent notes due August 2022 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.49 percent,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
