Suncorp Group Ltd. , an Australian
lender and insurer, headed for the biggest daily decline in
almost six months after reporting a lower-than-expected interim
dividend and amid concerns flooding in January will impact full-
year profit.  Shares  fell 4.3 percent to A$11.17 at 11:36 a.m. in Sydney,
on course for the biggest one-day drop since Aug. 27. The
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent. Suncorp
increased its interim  dividend  for the six months ended Dec. 31
to 25 Australian cents a share from 20 cents a year earlier,
compared with the median forecast of five analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News for 27 cents.  While benign weather and reduced claims in the first half
helped the Brisbane-based company increase net income by 48
percent, flooding and a cyclone in Queensland state in January
has already taken natural hazard claims to as much as A$417
million ($431 million), compared with a full-year allowance of
A$520 million, Suncorp said. The dividend payout ratio was 52
percent of cash earnings, down from 59 percent in the same
period of 2011 and less than the full-year target of 60 percent
to 80 percent, according to a regulatory filing.  The ratio “‘is at odds with a company who claims to have a
very strong capital position and potential for further special
dividends in the future,’’ said  Andrew Adams , an analyst with
 Credit Suisse Group AG . ‘‘With up to A$417 million of their
weather allowance already used to date, it does highlight the
downside risk to second half earnings.’’  Net income  rose to A$574 million in the six months ended
Dec. 31 from A$389 million a year earlier, the company said.
That compares with a forecast of A$567.7 million based on the
average of three analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Gross
written premium increased 9.6 percent to A$4.23 billion.  Operational efficiencies, revenue growth, favorable
investment markets and relatively benign weather conditions all
contributed to the improved result, the company said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
