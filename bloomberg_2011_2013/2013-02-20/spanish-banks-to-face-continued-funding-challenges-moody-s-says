Spanish banks will still face
funding and liquidity pressures in coming months even though
some were able tap bond markets earlier this year, Moody’s
Investors Service said.  “We still consider that liquidity and funding will
continue to constrain banks’ credit profiles over the coming
months,”  Pepa Mori , a Moody’s senior analyst and author of a
report on Spanish banks published today, said in a statement.
“While recognizing the decline in the system’s overall
financing requirements, Spanish banks continue to display
wholesale funding reliance at a time when accessibility to long-
term wholesale markets, while improving, has not normalized.”  Some larger Spanish banks have been able to sell senior and
covered bonds this year, while lenders have also cut their
reliance on funding from the European Central Bank and
maintained household and company deposits, Moody’s said.  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA , Spain’s second-biggest
lender, led banks opening bond issuance in Europe when it sold
1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of five-year bonds.  Banco
Santander SA , Banco Popular Espanol SA and CaixaBank are among
other lenders that have tapped debt markets this year.  Even so, expectations that industry operating conditions
will remain “negative” over the next year will prevent the
return to normal funding, the ratings company said.  Early repayments by Spanish banks of emergency three-year
loans has decreased the industry’s reliance on ECB funding by
about 41 billion euros ($55 billion), or 12 percent of
 borrowings , as of the end of 2012, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
