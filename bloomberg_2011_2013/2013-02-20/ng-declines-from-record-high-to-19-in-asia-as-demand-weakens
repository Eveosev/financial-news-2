The price of liquefied natural gas
in Asia declined after a four-month rally to a record high as
the spot market weakened on lower demand, according to World Gas
Intelligence.  Spot cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks cost $19
per million Btu in northeast Asia, the energy research company
said on its website today. That was down from $19.40 per mmBtu
Feb. 13. The price in southwest Europe was unchanged at $14.50,
according to WGI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
