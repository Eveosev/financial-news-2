Joy Global Inc. , the world’s biggest
producer of underground mining machines, may seek acquisitions
and would do “the right thing” for shareholders if it receives
third-party interest.  While Joy is focused on integrating past deals, the company
may seek purchases after accumulating more cash, Chief Executive
Officer  Michael Sutherlin  said at a Barclays Plc investor
conference today. Reports that Milwaukee-based Joy is a takeover
target are “constantly in the news,” with speculation about
 General Electric Co.  in the past and Sweden’s Atlas Copco AB
today, according to a William Blair & Co. report today.  “Rumors have come and gone and rumors will come and go,”
Sutherlin said during his presentation today. “We work for our
shareholders and are going to do the right thing for
shareholders. Whatever third parties want to do, we will do the
proper evaluation and make the right decision.”  Joy Global  rose 2.7 percent to $65.25 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 2.3 percent this year.  “If anybody should be consolidating this industry, we’ve
demonstrated our ability to add value, and we should be the guys
doing that,” Sutherlin said. The company is “focused” on
integrating its  acquisitions  of LeTourneau Technologies Inc. in
June 2011 and International Mining Machinery Holdings Ltd. last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
