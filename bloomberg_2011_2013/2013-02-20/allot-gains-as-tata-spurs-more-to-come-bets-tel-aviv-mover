Allot Communications Ltd. rose to a
seven-week high in New York on speculation an order from India’s
 Tata Communications Ltd. (TCOM)  will spur further emerging-market sales
for the Israeli technology company.  Shares (ALLT)  of Allot, the Israeli maker of products that track
wireless traffic, climbed 4.2 percent to $15.23, the highest
close since Jan. 2. In Tel Aviv, the  stock  gained 2 percent to
54.39 shekels, the highest since Feb. 5.  “This is the first service provider announced in India and
demonstrates the opportunity Allot has with major carriers in
emerging markets,”  Daniel Meron , an analyst at RBC Capital
Markets, who rates Allot the equivalent of buy, said by phone in
Tel Aviv. “Allot has been successful in gaining traction in
emerging markets and we expect this momentum to continue.”  Tata selected Allot’s service gateway solution to provide
cloud-hosted policy servers to mobile network operators, the
company said today. In November, Allot completed a deployment
project for affiliates of  Millicom International Cellular SA (MIICF) , a
group with operations in Latin America and Africa.  Allot’s 2012  sales to the Americas  doubled to 31 percent of
total revenue, according to an RBC Capital report dated Feb 5.
Sales to the Asia Pacific region rose 88 percent to almost 25
percent of the company’s total revenue, while customers in
Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa provided 44 percent of
revenue, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
