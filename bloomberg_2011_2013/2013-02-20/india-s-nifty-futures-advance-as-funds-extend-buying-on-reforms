Indian  stocks held at a two-week
high as some investors avoided taking fresh bets before next
week’s budget.  Reliance Industries Ltd . rallied the most in a
month, while  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd . surged to a record.  About three stocks fell for every two that climbed on the
30-member  S&P Dow Jones Sensex Index , which rose less than 0.1
percent to 19,642.75, the highest level since Feb. 5. Reliance,
the owner of the world’s largest refining complex, jumped 3.1
percent, the top  performer  on the gauge. Tata Consultancy, the
nation’s largest software maker, advanced 0.6 percent.  The government will present its annual spending plan on
Feb. 28. India cut its borrowing program, canceling on Feb. 18 a
$2.2 billion bond sale due on Feb. 22, as Finance Minister
 Palaniappan Chidambaram  curbed spending and raised $4 billion
selling stakes in state companies to pare a record deficit. The
moves are part of a wider policy overhaul since mid-September to
revive an economy growing at the slowest pace in a decade.  “The government woke up last year and instituted a number
of reforms and investors are looking for a continuation of that
determination,”  Geoffrey Lewis , global market strategist at
 JPMorgan Asset Management  in Hong Kong, said in an interview to
Bloomberg TV India today. “In a sense, that is more important
than the actual measures that are announced in the budget. We
are looking for an absence of populist measures ahead of the
elections” in 2014, he said.  Overseas funds have been net buyers of local equities for
every day this year, purchasing a total of $7.92 billion worth
of stocks, a record for the period, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They  bought  $24.5 billion of stocks last year, the most
among 10 Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China.  Ratings Warning  Chidambaram is under pressure to limit spending and keep
his pledge to reduce the deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic
product in four years, from a targeted 5.3 percent for this
fiscal year ending March 31. Officials are trying to avert a
credit-rating cut after Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings said
last year that they may demote India to junk, citing a budget
shortfall and record current-account gap.  The government plans gross market borrowing of about 6
trillion rupees ($111 billion) in the year through March 2014, a
record high, according to three Finance Ministry officials with
direct knowledge of preliminary estimates. The increase from
2012-2013’s level will provide funds for government spending and
debt repurchases as existing sovereign bonds near maturity, the
officials said, asking not to be identified as the details
aren’t public.  Reliance Partner  Reliance jumped 3.1 percent to 874.8 rupees, the steepest
gain since Jan. 17.  BP Plc  and Reliance, partners in India’s
biggest natural-gas deposit, plan to spend more than $5 billion
developing the area off the country’s eastern coast to restore
flagging output. Tata Consultancy rose 0.6 percent to 1,452.80
rupees, the highest price since its debut in August 2004.  HDFC
Bank Ltd ., the biggest lender by value, added 0.3 percent to
676.95 rupees, a one-month high.  ICICI Bank Ltd ., the third-biggest lender by value, lost
0.9 percent to 1,121.55 rupees, a two-month low.  Tata Motors ,
the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, fell for the first time in four
days, losing 0.9 percent to 303.95 rupees. Drugmaker  Cipla Ltd .
lost 1.6 percent to 381.6 rupees.  The Sensex is valued at 13.9 times  projected 12-month
profits , data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10.3 times. Profits at 43 percent
of the Sensex companies missed estimates in the three months
ended December, compared with 40 percent in the previous two
quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Earnings Slowdown  Earnings-per-share  for the Sensex companies in the year to
March 31, 2014, will probably be 1,320 rupees, 2 percent below
previous estimates,  Sanjeev Prasad , senior executive director at
Kotak Institutional Equities, said in an interview yesterday in
Mumbai. Profits grew 7.5 percent in the December quarter,
missing an 11 percent projection, he said.  “We may have reached a bottom but I’m not sure whether we
will see a recovery any time soon,” Prasad said. “Underlying
trends in volume, margin, profitability and banking sector non-
performing loans are very disappointing. Earnings downgrades are
still taking place.”  The CNX  Nifty  Index of the National Stock Exchange gained
0.1 percent to 5,943.05. India VIX, which measures the cost of
protection against declines in the Nifty, fell 1.3 percent to
15.60, the lowest since Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
