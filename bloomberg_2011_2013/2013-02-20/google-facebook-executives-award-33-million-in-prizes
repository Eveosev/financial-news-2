Executives from  Facebook Inc.  and
 Google Inc.  awarded $33 million in prizes to support research
aimed at curing diseases and extending life.  The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences is giving $3
million each to 11 winners in its first year, the foundation
that administers the program said in a  statement . Going forward,
five annual prizes of $3 million each will be granted.  The award was established by  Genentech Inc.  and  Apple Inc. 
Chairman  Art Levinson , Google co-founder  Sergey Brin , 23andMe
Inc. Chief Executive Officer  Anne Wojcicki , Mail.ru Group Ltd.
co-founder  Yuri Milner , Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg , and
 Priscilla Chan , a physician who is married to Zuckerberg. Prizes
are given to scientists pursuing research “aimed at curing
intractable diseases and extending human life,” according to
the statement.  “Our society needs more heroes that are scientists and
engineers,” Zuckerberg said today at an event in San Francisco
announcing the awards. “One of the things that is fundamentally
different is the winners are going to pick the winners going
forward.”  Recipients of the first batch of awards include professors
from Princeton University, Weill Cornell Medical College,
Hubrecht Institute in the Netherlands, and  Harvard Medical
School .  The selection process allows anyone to nominate a candidate
online for consideration. There are no age restrictions and the
prize can be shared between any number of scientists. Winners
will be invited to present public talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
