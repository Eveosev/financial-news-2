RSA Insurance Group Plc , the U.K.’s
biggest non-life insurer by market value, cut its dividend by 33
percent after investment income fell for the fourth straight
year. The shares dropped the most in almost nine years.  The company reduced its 2012 second-half payout to 3.9
pence a share from 5.82 pence a year earlier, London-based RSA
said today in a statement. The stock declined as much as 15
percent and was down 13 percent to 118.8 pence at 8:42 a.m. in
London trading, marking the biggest fall since March 2004.  The “surprise dividend cut leaves little support” for
RSA’s valuation,  Joy Ferneyhough , a London-based analyst at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank with a sell rating on the stock,
wrote in a note to clients. “Underlying earnings are likely to
come under increasing pressure from investment-income headwinds
and potentially dwindling reserve releases.”  RSA, which insures cars, homes and ships in the U.K.,
Scandinavia and emerging markets, said the decision to reduce
its dividend followed a “prolonged low bond yield environment”
that had cost it 200 million pounds ($308 million) in pretax
earnings since 2008. The company’s underwriting profit in 2012
was eroded by claims related to wet weather in the U.K. that
cost 60 million pounds more than usual and earthquakes in Italy
that cost 30 million pounds.  Seventh Highest  RSA had the seventh-highest dividend yield in the  FTSE 100
Index  before today, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Had we carried on with the current dividend policy, the
payout ratio would have been close to 100 percent in 2012,”
Chief Executive Officer  Simon Lee  said on a conference call with
reporters. “We felt that was an imbalanced approach and it
would be more prudent to keep more of the capital within the
business.”  RSA’s net income for 2012 dropped 18 percent to 351 million
pounds, missing the 380 million-pound median estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg .  Investment returns dropped to 515 million pounds in 2012
from 579 million pounds in the previous year, RSA said in the
statement. The dividend cut will save 100 million pounds in
2013, providing an opportunity to grow the business, Lee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
