Turkey’s  10-year bond yields  headed
for their highest level in almost three months on concern
 inflation  will accelerate after the central bank cut interest
rates yesterday for a second time this year.  Yields on the securities jumped as much as seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.03 percent, their highest
level on a closing basis since Nov. 29 and increasing the  spread 
with consumer price inflation-linked debt by 53 basis points
this year. The yield pared its advance to 6.98 percent by 1:17
p.m. in Istanbul, increasing for a third day.  Foreign investors “are now more concentrated on linkers
given the outlook on Turkish CPI, which makes it difficult for
nominal bonds to perform in the long-end”  Luis Costa , an
emerging-markets strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London, said in
e-mailed comments.  Turkey’s central bank reduced overnight borrowing and
lending rates by 25 basis points yesterday to 4.5 percent and
8.5 percent, respectively. Consumer price inflation accelerated
to 7.3 percent in January from 6.2 percent a month earlier,
above the bank’s 5 percent target.  The lira weakened 0.2 percent to 1.7792 against the dollar,
depreciating for a third day.  Yields  on two-year benchmark lira
notes rose one basis point to 5.67 percent, climbing for the
first time in three days.  Central Bank Governor  Erdem Basci  is looking to slow
inflation to 5 percent this year, while he seeks to curb loan
growth to 15 percent, according to the central bank. Lending
jumped 19.1 percent in the 12 months to Feb. 8, according to
data published by the banking regulator on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
