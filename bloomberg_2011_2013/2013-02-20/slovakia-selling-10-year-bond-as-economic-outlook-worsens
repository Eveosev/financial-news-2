Slovakia sold 1.75 billion euros
($2.34 billion) of benchmark 10-year bonds as the eastern member
in the 17-nation currency bloc boosted financing amid an
economic slowdown.  The offering was priced to yield 122 basis points, or 1.22
percentage points, over the corresponding mid-swap rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That represents a 146
basis-point premium over similar-maturity German bunds, or 12
basis points above the spread for Poland.  Expansion in the export-oriented  economy  is set to slow as
demand abroad has weakened while job cuts have eroded consumer
spending. The government will probably collect 361 million euros
less in taxes this year, the Finance Ministry said this month,
after cutting its growth forecast to 1.2 percent from 2.1
percent.  “The budget picture isn’t rosy and if the growth outlook
worsens further it can be a problem, mainly in 2014,” said
 Jaromir Sindel , an economist at Citigroup Inc. in Prague. “It
makes sense for the government to hit the market early and
increase its financing buffer.”  Slovakia is rated A2, the fifth-lowest investment grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service. The extra yield investors demand to
hold 10-year euro-denominated bonds by similarly ranked Poland
instead of Germany’s benchmark bund narrowed four basis points
to 134 basis points today. Slovakia joined the euro-area
currency bloc in 2009, while Poland has yet to adopt Europe’s
shared currency.  Public Sale  Slovakia’s last public sale of government debt on the
international market was in November when it raised 1.25 billion
euros in an offering of notes due in 2024 at 150 basis points
above the mid-swap rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has 4.1 billion euros in debt securities maturing
this year, out of total debt of 35 billion euros, the data show.  The yield on the benchmark 2020 bond rose one basis point
to 2.23 percent at 3:34 p.m. in Bratislava, Slovakia. The
securities are yielding 115 basis points more than corresponding
German notes.  Deutsche Bank AG, ING Groep NV, Societe Generale SA and
Erste Group Bank AG’s Slovenska Sporitelna AS managed today’s
sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
