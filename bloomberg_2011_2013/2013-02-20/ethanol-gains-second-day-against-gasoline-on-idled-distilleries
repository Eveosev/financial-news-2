Ethanol gained for a second day
against gasoline as prices for the motor fuel plunged the most
since November and as biofuel producers tempered output.  The spread narrowed 5.87 cents to 69.45 cents a gallon, the
smallest difference since Feb. 13 and the biggest one-day
contraction since Jan. 15, according to futures market data
compiled by Bloomberg. More than a dozen ethanol companies have
idled output since June to stem losses, and  stockpiles  have
fallen to the lowest level in 10 weeks.  “The thing to be looking at is production with the
shutdowns in place,” said Jeffrey DeReamer, an ethanol broker
at ICAP Energy in Lexington, Kentucky. “Production is the key
at this point. That’s been supporting ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 0.3 cent to
$2.365 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures have
advanced 8 percent this year.  Gasoline for March delivery tumbled 6.17 cents to $3.0595 a
gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The 2 percent drop
was the most since Nov. 7.  Ethanol  output  in the week ended Feb. 8 averaged 789,000
barrels a day, 18 percent lower than the record 963,000 barrels
a day on Dec. 30, 2011, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.  That’s helped the industry reduce  stockpiles  by 14 percent
to 19.5 million barrels from the all-time high of 22.7 million
in the week ended March 16, 2012, according to the EIA.  Plants Idled  Ethanol producers including  Poet LLC , the largest U.S.
maker of the fuel, No. 3  Valero Energy Corp.  and  Abengoa SA  have
idled plants to alleviate a glut and navigate higher production
costs caused by more expensive corn since drought in the U.S.
devastated yields.  Corn for March delivery rose 5.25 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$7.005 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol. Corn futures rose to a record $8.49 a bushel
in August as drought in the Midwest cut yields.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was minus 18 cents,
compared with minus 16 cents yesterday. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Brazil Competition  DeReamer said ethanol prices have also received a boost as
gains for the Brazilian grade make it less competitive with
domestic supply.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  cost $2.38 a gallon last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg, more expensive than
today’s futures price.  The country is the largest seller of ethanol to the U.S.
 Imports  have plunged 87 percent since Dec. 28 to 11,000 barrels
a day as of Feb. 8, EIA data show.  Gasoline retail prices have climbed for 34 consecutive days
to $3.766 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool as of Feb. 8, the highest level in four
weeks, the EIA said in its most recent report.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York rose 1 cent to
$2.455 a gallon, in Chicago the additive increased 1.75 cents to
$2.3625, in the U.S. Gulf the fuel added 0.5 cent to $2.405 and
on the West Coast ethanol dropped 1 cent to $2.525 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  New York’s premium to Chicago was 9.25 cents, the lowest
since Feb. 4. Ethanol on the West Coast, the most expensive U.S.
hub, was 12 cents costlier than in the U.S. Gulf.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, for  advanced forms of ethanol , which include the Brazilian
variety, was at 52 cents yesterday, or 79 percent more expensive
than the 29-cent price of the  conventional sort , data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting federal biofuel use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
