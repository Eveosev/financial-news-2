Silver Wheaton Corp. , the world’s
largest buyer of precious-metal output rights from copper, zinc
and lead mines, is seeking a second purchase this year after
paying $1.9 billion for gold from Vale SA.  The company, whose model of paying for mining companies’
future gold and silver by-product to help fund projects is known
as streaming, has more than $1 billion in available cash and
revolving credits for purchases in the Americas, Chief Executive
Officer  Randy Smallwood  said.  “It would surprise me if we didn’t get one done this
year,” Smallwood, 48, said about possible output acquisitions
in a telephone interview from Vancouver. “The two key countries
for our company are Mexico and Peru.”  Silver Wheaton has bought output rights from Vale, Hudbay
Minerals Inc. and Barrick Gold Corp. in Latin America since
2009. It also bought shares in Bear Creek Mining Corp., which is
developing silver mines in Peru.  The Vancouver-based company estimates output of 33.5
million ounces of silver equivalent in 2013, including 145,000
ounces of gold, rising to 53 million ounces in 2017, according
to data on its website.  Silver prices will probably average $34.16 per ounce this
year, according to 19 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg,
compared with $31.19 in 2012. Silver slumped 2.8 percent to
$28.60 an ounce in New York. Silver Wheaton fell 6.3 percent to
C$32.84 in Toronto.  “We do think silver will outperform gold,” Smallwood
said. “There’s nowhere near the above-ground stockpile that can
sometimes go against gold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
