Canadian home resale prices fell for
a fifth straight month in January, the longest string of
declines since the countryâ€™s 2009 recession, according to the
Teranet-National Bank Composite House Price Index.  National prices fell 0.3 percent during the month,
according to a report today by National Bank Financial. Prices
were up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the slowest pace since
November 2009.  The index tracks prices in 11 major cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
