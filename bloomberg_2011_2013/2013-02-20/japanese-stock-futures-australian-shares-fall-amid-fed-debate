Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities fell after minutes of the  Federal Reserve ’s
meeting showed policy makers were divided about bond purchases
known as quantitative easing.  American Depositary Receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
carmaker that gets a quarter of its revenue in  North America ,
slid 0.4 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
Suppliers for Apple Inc. may be active in Asia as Foxconn
Technology Group, the manufacturer of products including the
iPhone, froze hiring in China. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s
biggest miner, fell for a second day, losing 3 percent, after
reporting yesterday that first-half profit plunged 58 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in

percent in Wellington.  “The Fed now is getting very nervous about the
continuation of its quantitative easing program,” said Matthew Sherwood, head of investment market research in Sydney at
Perpetual Investments, which manages about $25 billion. “If
they say they have to wind it down before the labor market
stabilizes, that would take one of the key supports away from
the market.”  Fed Minutes  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index fell 1.2 percent in New York yesterday, the
biggest drop since November, as minutes of the Federal Open

divided about the strategy behind Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s
program of buying bonds until there is “substantial”
improvement in a U.S. labor market.  Some said an earlier end to purchases might be needed, and
others warned against a premature withdrawal of stimulus.
Several policy makers said the central bank should be ready to
vary the pace of its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 11 percent from the

with 13.7 for the  S&P 500 (SPX)  and 12.5 for the  Stoxx Europe 600
