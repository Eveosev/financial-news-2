Cells of a main battery on an  All
Nippon Airways Co.  Dreamliner that made an emergency landing
were damaged by heat, Japan Transport Safety Board said, as
authorities deepen investigation into the cause of fires that
caused worldwide grounding of the Boeing Co. 787s.  All the eight main battery cells on the All Nippon jet that
made the emergency landing on Jan. 16 sustained “thermal
damage,” Safety Board chief Norihiro Goto told reporters in
Tokyo today. Further investigations are needed to identify the
the cause of damage, Goto said.  Damage to battery electrodes may have been caused by
overheating from the thermal runaway within the cell, Goto said.
Thermal runaway occurs when the heat generated within a battery
builds up faster than it can dissipate.  The global Dreamliner fleet was grounded after the All
Nippon B787 made the emergency landing at Japan’s Takamatsu
airport because of a battery-fault warning. A week earlier there
was a battery fire on a Japan Airlines Co. 787 in Boston. The
U.S. safety experts determined the fire had originated in a
lithium-ion battery.  Boeing  may suggest a temporary fix to improve the 787’s
ability to withstand overheating of its lithium-ion batteries as
soon as this week, the Seattle Times reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
