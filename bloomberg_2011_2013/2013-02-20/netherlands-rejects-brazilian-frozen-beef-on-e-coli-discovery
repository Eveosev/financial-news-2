The Netherlands rejected a shipment
of frozen beef from Brazil because of a finding of “potentially
pathogenic” E. coli, a notification to the European Union’s
food-alert system showed.  Frozen beef sampled on Jan. 23 in border checks tested
positive for the bacteria, according to the  notice  from the
Netherlands dated yesterday. The meat was rejected at the border
and the consignment detained, according to the notice.  While often harmless, E. coli can cause diarrhea, urinary-
tract infections, respiratory illness and pneumonia, according
to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
