West Texas Intermediate’s push
toward $100 a barrel for the first time since September is
facing resistance from a Fibonacci level at $98, according to
technical analysis by Petromatrix GmbH.  April WTI, which will become the front-month future
tomorrow after contracts for delivery in March expire, was at
$97.46 a barrel at 11:20 a.m. London time. WTI faces a barrier
at $98, a price equivalent to 61.8 percent of the difference
between the U.S. benchmark’s lowest and highest points last
year, the researcher said in an e-mailed report today.  “After proving that it can hold the support of $95, WTI
still needs to prove that it can break the resistance at $98,”
said  Olivier Jakob , managing director at the Zug, Switzerland-
based consultant.  WTI repeatedly encountered resistance at $98 in an earlier
rally from July to September last year, Petromatrix’s Jakob
said. The grade will meet further barriers at $98.30, and then
$99, before it can gather enough momentum to reach $100, a level
last surpassed on Sept. 14, he said.  The Fibonacci sequence of numbers is used by traders to
predict areas of support and resistance as markets repeat
earlier movements.  Barclays Plc said in a report yesterday that WTI has shown
signs of faltering, and that a drop to $95.50 a barrel could
trigger losses to as low as $92.35. The level of $95.50
corresponds to a “double-top” formed after futures halted
advanced to near $98 on Jan. 31 and Feb. 13.  The “bearish signals in WTI are not yet confirmed,”
analysts  Jordan Kotick  in New York and  Dhiren Sarin  in Singapore
wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
