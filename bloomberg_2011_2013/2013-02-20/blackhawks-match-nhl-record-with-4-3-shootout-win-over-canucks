Patrick Kane  and Andrew Shaw scored
in a shootout to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 4-3 win against
the Vancouver Canucks to tie the National Hockey League record
for a season-opening point streak.  The Blackhawks, with a 13-0-3 record, have recorded at
least one point in each of their first 16 games to match the
Anaheim Ducks, who set the record at 12-0-4 in the 2006-07
season when they won the Stanley Cup.  Chicago, which leads the NHL with 13 wins and three
overtime losses for 29 points, can break the record when it
hosts the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 22.  Patrick Sharp  tied the score at 1-1 for the Blackhawks six
minutes, 36 seconds into the second period.  Marian Hossa 
followed with back-to-back goals 3 1/2 minutes apart to give
Chicago a 3-1 lead on home ice at the United Center.  Hossa left the game with an upper-body injury a minute into
the third period when he was hit from behind by Canucks forward
 Jannik Hansen , who got a two-minute penalty for roughing.  The Canucks tied the game in the third period with a power-
play goal by  Alexander Edler  and a score by  Kevin Bieksa  in the
final three minutes of regulation play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
