Cia. Pernambucana de Saneamento, a
Brazilian water utility, signed a 4.5 billion-real ($2.3
billion) agreement to expand sewer coverage in 15 communities
around the northeastern city of Recife.  Foz do Brasil SA,  Odebrecht SA  and Lidermac Construcoes &
Equipamentos Ltda. will invest 3.5 billion reais expanding
sanitation services under the public-private partnership,
according to Compesa, as the company is known. Compesa and the
Pernambuco state government will furnish the remaining funds.  The project will boost sewer coverage in the region to 90
percent in 12 years from 30 percent now, Compesa said in the
Feb. 15 statement. About 9,000 kilometers (5,600 miles) of sewer
pipes are being built to benefit 3.7 million residents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
