Taiwan dollar forwards advanced to
the strongest level in a week after investors boosted holdings
of the island’s stocks on optimism economic growth in the region
is picking up. Government bonds declined.  Global funds bought $180 million more local shares than
they sold in the last two days, taking net purchases this year
to $1.8 billion, according to exchange data. Bank of Korea
Governor  Kim Choong Soo  said in an interview yesterday that an
improved global outlook increases the odds of the South Korean
economy exceeding this year’s growth forecast.  “Asia’s economic growth has been bottoming out,” said
Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in
Taipei. “Risk sentiment has been improving.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.1 percent
to NT$29.54 versus the dollar as of 4:14 p.m. local time, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. They touched a one-week high of
NT$29.495 earlier.  In the spot market, the currency advanced 0.3 percent to
NT$29.6 against its U.S. counterpart, according to prices from
Taipei Forex Inc. The central bank has sold the local currency
near the close on most days in the past 10 months, according to
traders who asked not to be identified.  The island’s economy expanded 3.4 percent last quarter from
a year earlier, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey before finalized official data due Feb. 22. Gross
domestic product increased 0.98 percent in the preceding three
months.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 4.92 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 1.125 percent bonds due March 2023 added
one basis point to 1.213 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.385
percent, a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
