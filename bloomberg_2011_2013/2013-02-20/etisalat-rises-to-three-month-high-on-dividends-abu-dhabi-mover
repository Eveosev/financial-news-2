Etisalat, the largest of the United
Arab Emirates’ two phone companies, rose to the highest level in
more than three months as a potential 17 percent dividend
increase overshadowed earnings below estimates.  Shares of Emirates Telecommunications Corp., as the company
is formally known, advanced 2.9 percent to 10.10 dirhams, the
highest level since Nov. 14, at the close in Abu Dhabi. The
shares were the biggest gainer on the benchmark  ADX General
Index , which rose 1.6 percent.  Etisalat’s board recommended a 45 fils a share  dividend  for
the second half, taking the total 2012 dividend to 70 fils a
share, compared with 60 fils for 2011. The company with the
second-heaviest weighting on the benchmark index said yesterday
full-year profit surged 15 percent to 6.74 billion dirhams ($1.8
billion), missing the 7.54 billion-dirham mean estimate of nine
analysts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “What is attracting investors to Etisalat shares today is
cash dividends that came above expectations,” said  Tariq Qaqish , deputy head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal
Capital PSC. Growth in sales also helped the shares gain, Qaqish
said. Etisalat said revenue grew 2 percent to 33 billion
dirhams.  The company’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 79
today. A reading above 70 indicates to some investors that the
security is poised to drop. Four analysts recommend investors
buy Etisalat shares, six have a hold rating on the stock and
none say sell, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
