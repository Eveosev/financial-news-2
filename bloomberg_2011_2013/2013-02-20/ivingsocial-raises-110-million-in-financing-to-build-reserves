LivingSocial Inc., the daily-coupon
site that has struggled amid diminishing demand for its wares,
raised $110 million in financing to add to its cash reserves and
solidify its long-term planning.  The funding round included existing board members and
investors, Washington-based LivingSocial said in an internal
memo obtained by Bloomberg.  “We have an aggressive roadmap for profitability and
expansion this year, and those plans include increased
investment in areas like marketing, technologies, and mobile,”
LivingSocial said in the memo. “This new investment round will
allow us to dedicate the resources we need, while also building
a significant cash reserve against unanticipated events
or bumps in the road.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
