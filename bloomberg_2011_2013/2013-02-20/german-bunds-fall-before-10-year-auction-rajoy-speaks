Spain’s government bonds advanced
for a second day after Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said the
budget deficit narrowed last year, spurring optimism his efforts
to repair the country’s finances are working.  The nation’s  10-year yields  dropped to the lowest level in
three weeks as Rajoy told lawmakers in Madrid that the worst
threat to Spain from the region’s debt crisis was receding.
German bunds fell, with 10-year yields rising the most in the
week, as demand declined when the government auctioned 5 billion
euros ($6.69 billion) of the securities. Portugal’s borrowing
costs fell to the lowest in almost three years at an auction of
1.16 billion euros of 12-month bills.  “Rajoy said the worst is not over but the acute challenges
have faded away,” said  Christian Lenk , a fixed-income analyst
at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt. “He also pointed out there’s still
a pretty long road to go and he will have to stick to austerity.
The market seems to like it, given the move in Spanish yields.”  Spanish  10-year bond yields  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.18 percent at 4:17 p.m. London time,
after dropping to 5.13 percent, the lowest since Jan. 29. The
5.4 percent security due January 2023 rose 0.175, or 1.75 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.68.  The nation’s benchmark yield has now dropped more than 2
percentage points since climbing to a euro-era  record  of 7.75
percent on July 25.  “In a time of recession like the one Spain is going
through now, I can inform you that Spain’s public deficit was
below 7 percent of GDP last year,” Rajoy said before the annual
parliamentary debate on the state of the nation.  Economists’ Forecasts  Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a gap of 8
percent of gross domestic product for last year, compared with a
6.3 percent target set by the European Union. The number
includes European aid to recapitalize Spanish banks, which
Rajoy’s figure doesn’t, and matches the European Commission’s
November prediction.  The Madrid-based Treasury is scheduled to sell as much as 4
billion euros of debt maturing between 2015 and 2023 tomorrow.
It last auctioned 10-year bonds on Dec. 5 at an average yield of
5.29 percent.  Spain is selling five-year dollar-denominated notes this
week and may price the securities today, according to a person
familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set.  Yield Cap  Spain is limiting the amount of interest its 17 semi-
autonomous regions can pay to borrow, shutting many out of debt
markets, as it seeks to repair the nation’s finances, two people
familiar with the matter said.  The government wants administrations to pay yields no more
than 100 basis points more than sovereign securities when they
sell bonds, said the people, who asked not to be identified
before the policy is announced.  Germany allotted 4.04 billion euros of 10-year government
debt at an average yield of 1.66 percent, the Bundesbank said.
The remainder went to the central bank. The rate compares with a
yield of 1.56 percent at the previous auction on Jan. 16 and was
the highest since April.  The nation received bids for 5.03 billion euros at the
sale, compared with a 5 billion-euro target.  “It’s a weak German auction,” said  Lyn Graham-Taylor , a
fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“It was only just covered. People seem to think there is
limited upside to bunds at the moment because yields are very
low. There’s a continuation of the theme of people seeking
yields and that’s pressuring bunds.”  German Yields  Germany’s  10-year yield  increased four basis points to 1.66
percent after climbing to 1.70 percent on Feb. 13, the highest
level since Feb. 4.  Portugal sold bills due in February 2014 at an average
yield of 1.277 percent, the lowest since April 2010, the debt
management agency said. That compares with an average yield of
1.609 percent at a previous auction of 12-month bills on Jan.
16. It also sold 345 million euros of three-month securities at
an average yield of 0.737 percent.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets, followed by those of Germany and Austria, according to
measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and 10-
year securities and credit-default swaps.  France is scheduled to auction as much as 8 billion euros
of notes maturing between 2015 and 2018 tomorrow, as well as up
to 2.5 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds due in 2024.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.5
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spanish securities returned 2.3 percent and
Italian debt gained 1.3 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
