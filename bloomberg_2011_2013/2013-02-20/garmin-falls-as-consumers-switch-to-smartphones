     Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Garmin Ltd. , the biggest maker of
navigation devices, declined the most in more than three years
after forecasting 2013 sales and profit that missed estimates,
as consumers switch to smartphones for maps and directions.  Garmin’s stock fell 9.4 percent to $35.54 at the close in
New York, for the biggest drop since November 2009. The stock
has declined 20 percent in the past year, compared with an 11
percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Full-year sales will be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, the
company said in a statement, trailing the average analyst
 estimate  of $2.76 billion. Personal navigation devices, which
accounted for 55 percent of Garmin’s revenue last year, are
falling out of favor as global satellite positioning becomes
standard on smartphones, and more new cars come equipped with
factory-installed navigation units, said  James Faucette , an
analyst at Pacific Crest Securities LLC.  “If you’re Best Buy, you want to carry less than you had
in the past,” said Faucette, who rates the stock an outperform
with a target price of $38.97. “The personal navigation device
market will shrink 10 percent and the inventory reduction will
add another 3 to 4 percent to that year over year.”  Garmin forecast profit in 2013, excluding currency gains or
losses, of $2.30 to $2.40 a share, missing the average analyst
 estimate  of $2.85, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growth in Garmin’s outdoor, fitness, marine, and aviation
segments will “partially offset ongoing declines in the PND
market,” the company said in the statement. Schaffhausen,
Switzerland-based Garmin’s  board  of directors authorized a $300
million share repurchase program through the end of 2014.  Fourth-quarter net income fell 22 percent to $129.3
million, or 66 cents a share, from $165.6 million, or 85 cents,
a year earlier. Sales fell 16 percent to $768.5 million, less
than analysts’ $833.4 million estimate.  The lack of seasonal strength in the fourth quarter was
surprising, said  Rich Valera , an analyst at Needham & Co., as
personal navigation devices lost favor as holiday gifts. He
rates the shares a hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
