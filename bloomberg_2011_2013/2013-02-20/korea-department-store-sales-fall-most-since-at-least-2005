Sales at major South Korean
department stores fell the most since at least 2005 in January
after the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday distorted year-
on-year comparisons.  Outlays  at the three biggest chains dropped 8.2 percent in
January from a year earlier after a 0.2 percent decline in
December, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement
today.  Discount-store sales  fell 24.6 percent last month, the
report showed.  The three-day Lunar New Year holiday fell in February this
year after occurring in January last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
