Ageas SA , the majority owner of
Belgium’s biggest life insurer, reported profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after selling properties in Belgium and
buying Groupama’s U.K. business at a discount.  Net income in the three months through December rose to
224.6 million euros ($301.6 million) from a  restated  26 million
euros a year earlier, the Brussels-based insurer said today in a
statement. Analysts projected profit of 185.1 million euros,
according to the average of nine estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Ageas will raise its  dividend  by 50 percent to 1.20
euros a share.  The investment margin in the Belgian life business more
than doubled to 1.28 percent in the fourth quarter, led by gains
on real-estate disposals and lower reserves for profit sharing
with clients in contracts with a guaranteed return. Ageas also
recorded a 63 million-euro badwill gain from  buying  Groupama’s
unit in the U.K. at a discount to net assets, as the insurer
seeks to expand its property and casualty business to become
less dependent on investment income.  “Our inflows and results in Life were particularly strong
notwithstanding the low interest rate environment,” Chief
Executive Officer  Bart De Smet  said in the statement.  The increase in gross inflows accelerated to 24 percent in
the fourth quarter and advanced 16 percent in all of last year,
led by a 28 percent gain in  Asia , where Ageas has a fully owned
subsidiary in Hong Kong and minority stakes in China, Malaysia,
Thailand and India.  Ageas climbed as much as 4.7 percent in Brussels  trading ,
the highest intraday value since April 2010, and traded 1.20
euros higher at 27.25 euros by 9:26 a.m. local time. The shares
have gained 61 percent in the past 12 months, the  best
performance  among the 33 companies in the Stoxx Insurance 600
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
