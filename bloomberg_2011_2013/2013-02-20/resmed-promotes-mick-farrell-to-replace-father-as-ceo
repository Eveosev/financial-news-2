ResMed Inc. , a maker of machines to
regulate breathing for people with sleep disorders, promoted
 Mick Farrell  to replace his father as chief executive officer.  Farrell, 40, has served as president of the Americas since
2011, overseeing a division where sales rose more than 30
percent in the past seven quarters, the Poway, California-based
company said in a statement today. His father,  Peter Farrell ,
70, will remain executive chairman through the end of the year,
then serve as non-executive chairman.  Rob Douglas , the chief operating officer, will assume the
role of president, the company said. ResMed generated more than
half of its $1.4 billion in sales last fiscal year in the U.S.  “It was easily determined that members of the very
talented and experienced team that have driven much of the
company’s great success over the past decade would be the best
suited to lead the company to its next stage of growth and
development,” said  Gary Pace , ResMed’s lead director and
chairman of the board’s succession committee.  Before joining ResMed in 2001, Mick Farrell worked for
Genzyme Corp., Dow Chemical Co., Arthur D. Little and BHP
Billiton Ltd. He has a bachelor’s of engineering degree from the
University of New South Wales and a master’s of science from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
