Total Kenya Ltd. , the local unit of
Europe’s third-largest oil company, climbed to a one-month high
after Business Daily reported it received 5.2 billion shillings
($59.4 million) in new capital from its parent.  The shares rose 1.4 percent to 14.05 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the highest since Jan. 21.
About 101,000 securities traded, more than four times the three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Total SA  increased its stake to 93.96 percent from 87.27
percent in May after providing capital worth 5.2 billion
shillings, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported today, citing
regulatory filings.  “The capital will help retire part of the debt that had
suppressed Total’s profit growth due to the high interest
expense,”  Faith Atiti , an analyst at Nairobi-based NIC
Securities Ltd., said today in an e-mailed note to clients.  Total Kenya reported a loss of 259.7 million shillings in
the six months ended June 30, compared with a profit of 79.7
million shillings a year earlier, as financial expenses
increased by 749 million shillings, it said in August.  The stock has gained  1.4 percent  this year, underperforming
a 12 percent advance by the Nairobi Securities Exchange All-
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
