Gasoline weakened for the first time
in four days in New York as tankers carrying fuel from Europe
were set to arrive in the region, adding to supplies.  About 28 gasoline tankers on the Europe-U.S. route were
loaded in the two weeks to today, according to the median
estimate in a survey of eight shipbrokers and traders
specializing in the market. That’s the highest number of
bookings since Nov. 21.  Stockpiles  in the Central Atlantic region, including New
York Harbor, increased to 32.8 million in the week ended Feb. 8,
according to the Energy Information Administration. That’s the
 eighth consecutive  weekly advance, the longest string of gains
since January 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Reformulated , 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the harbor
region retreated 0.38 cent to a discount of 2.38 cents a gallon
below futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:54 a.m.
Conventional,  87-octane  gasoline was unchanged at a premium of
1.38 cents a gallon. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the region
gained 1.25 cent to 10.5 cents above futures.  There is speculation that more cargoes are headed for the
New York region and are carrying mostly alkylates, according to
 Carl Larry , president of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.
Alkylates are a high-octane component used to blend in gasoline.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and distillates based on Brent oil in
Europe, climbed 21.5 cents to $14.62 a barrel at 2:12 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
