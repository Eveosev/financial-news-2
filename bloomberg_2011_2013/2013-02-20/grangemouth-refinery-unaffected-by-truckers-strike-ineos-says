The  Grangemouth  oil refinery in
Scotland will operate as normal even if BP Plc’s tanker drivers
based in the area go on strike for three days beginning Feb. 22
in a dispute over pensions.  BP is “one of a number of companies” that employ drivers
to take oil products from the plant,  Richard Longden , a
spokesman for Ineos Group AG, which owns the facility through
its Petroineos venture with PetroChina Co., said today by
telephone from Geneva. He declined to comment on how much fuel
is transported by the affected truckers. The facility can
process 210,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tanker drivers employed by BP deliver aviation fuel to
airports in Scotland as well as diesel and gasoline to retail
stations in the region, according to Tony Trench, an official at
Unite, the U.K.’s largest labor union, whose members include
those workers.  “We are continuing to hold discussions with our partners
on potential contingency plans in order to minimize disruption
to our passengers,” an official from Edinburgh Airport Ltd.
said today in an e-mailed statement. The airport receives all of
its fuel from Grangemouth, the person said, asking not to
identified because of company policy.  BP said in a statement yesterday that it was working to
“minimize any potential disruption” that the strike could
cause.  To contact the reporter on this story:
