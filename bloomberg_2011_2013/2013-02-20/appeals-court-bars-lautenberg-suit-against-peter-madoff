The charitable foundation of U.S.
Senator  Frank Lautenberg  cannot continue a $9 million lawsuit
against  Bernard Madoff ’s brother Peter, an appeals court ruled.  Affirming lower court decisions, the appeal judges said
“there would ensue a chaotic rush to the courthouse” by
parties seeking assets that by law belong to the Madoff estate,
if such private suits were not stopped.  The Lautenberg appeal is In re Bernard L. Madoff, 11-
cv-02135, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
