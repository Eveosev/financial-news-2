Latvia will probably succeed in its
plan to adopt the euro in 2014 and Lithuania will make the
switch the following year, according to Fitch Ratings.  The recovery of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from
recession in 2008-2009 was a “remarkable success story,” Fitch
said today in a report. The three nations’ open economies, high
levels of external debt and elevated ratio of bank lending to
deposits make them “inherently volatile,” the ratings company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
