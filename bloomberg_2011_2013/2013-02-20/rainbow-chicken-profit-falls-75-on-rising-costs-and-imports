Rainbow Chicken Ltd. , South Africa’s
largest chicken producer, said first-half earnings fell almost
75 percent as rising imports, high costs and oversupply in its
domestic market eroded margins.  Profit for the six months through December fell to 52.3
million rand ($5.9 million), compared with 200.4 million rand in
the same period a year ago, the company said today in a
statement. Sales increased 15 percent to 4.5 billion rand.  “The lower than anticipated earnings are mainly a function
of two major issues facing the local poultry market, namely
record levels of imports and high feed raw material input
costs,” Rainbow said.  “The resultant over-supply in the local market has meant
that the price of chicken in retail bears little reference to
its cost of production,” it said.  Rainbow  shares  retreated as much as 1.7 percent, the most
since Feb. 18, and traded 0.7 percent lower at 14.70 rand by
4.36 p.m. in Johannesburg. About 408,000 shares changed hands,
almost twice the three month daily average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The earnings were disappointing,” said  Jiten Bechoo , an
analyst at Cape Town-based Avior Research Pty Ltd., in a phone
interview. “The company was expected to perform less badly than
its peers. Sector dynamics for poultry are pretty bad right now.
The margins will remain under pressure for fiscal 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
