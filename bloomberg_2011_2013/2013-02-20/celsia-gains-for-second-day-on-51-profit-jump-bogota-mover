Celsia SA , the fourth-biggest power
generator in Colombia, rose for a second day after reporting a
51 percent jump in annual earnings, with revenue that beat
brokerage firm Correval SA’s estimate.  Celsia rose 1.4 percent to 5,970 pesos at 12:56 p.m. in
Bogota. The shares have gained 12 percent this year, the second-
best performer on the Colombian stock exchange’s  IGBC index ,
which has returned 0.6 percent.  Net income gained 51 percent to 230.8 billion pesos in 2012
from the prior year, according to a  filing  late yesterday.
Operating revenue rose 9.4 percent to 2.02 trillion pesos,
exceeding Correval’s estimate of 1.99 trillion pesos.  The Medellin-based company will propose an 11 percent
 dividend  increase to 100 pesos per share to be approved by
holders at a March meeting, according to the filing.  Celsia, which is controlled by the Medellin-based
investment company Grupo Argos SA, is Colombia’s fourth-biggest
generator, according to its  website . The company has an
installed generating capacity of 1,777 megawatts, according to
yesterday’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
