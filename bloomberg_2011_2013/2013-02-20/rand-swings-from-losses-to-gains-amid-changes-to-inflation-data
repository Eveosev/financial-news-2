South African bond yields slid the
most in almost three weeks after a report showed the nation’s
inflation rate dropped to a five-month low. The rand weakened,
erasing gains earlier today.  Yields on benchmark 10.5 percent bonds due December 2026
fell as much as 11 basis points and were 6 basis points down at
7.217 percent as of 5:30 p.m. in Johannesburg, the most on a
closing basis since Jan. 31. The currency of Africa’s biggest
economy fell 0.2 percent to 8.8750 per dollar, paring an earlier
advance of as much as 0.3 percent.  Inflation slowed to 5.4 percent in January from 5.7 percent
in December, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said on its
website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 19
economists was 5.7 percent. Prices rose 0.3 percent in the
month.  “The lower CPI data this morning has given the local bond
market a small boost,”  Manik Narain , an emerging-markets
strategist at UBS AG in London, said by e-mail. “Investors are
waiting for the budget next week for clearer direction on
policy.”  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  may struggle to keep pay
demands under control and meet his budget targets after the
government raised wages by more than double the inflation rate
in the past five years. Gordhan will give his budget speech on
Feb. 27.  The Reserve Bank has held its benchmark repurchase rate at
5 percent since a surprise cut in July. The bank’s mandate is to
keep inflation within a range of 3 percent to 6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
