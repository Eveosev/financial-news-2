South Africa’s corn output probably
increased 5.9 percent this season from a year earlier, according
to a survey. The nation may leave its estimate for wheat
production unchanged.  Farmers may harvest 12.5 million metric tons of corn,
according to a median estimate of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The range was 11.95 million tons to 12.8 million tons
and compares with the 11.8 million tons produced in the 2011-12
season. The Crop Estimates Committee will release its data on
Feb. 26.  South Africa, the largest corn producer on the continent,
produced 12.8 million tons in 2010, the biggest crop since 1982.
Meal made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods
and the yellow variety is mainly used as animal feed.  The committee will probably leave its estimate for the area
of corn planted unchanged from last month’s forecast of 2.78
million hectares (6.9 million acres) the survey showed. The
range was 2.74 million hectares and 2.8 million hectares.  Yellow corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
dropped 2 percent to 2,026 rand ($228) a ton by the close in
Johannesburg yesterday. The white variety for delivery in the
same month, fell 0.9 percent to 2,027 rand a ton.  The committee may leave its estimate for the wheat harvest
unchanged at 1.92 million tons, according to the median of the
forecasts. The previous prediction was made on Jan. 24.  Wheat for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to 3,483 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
