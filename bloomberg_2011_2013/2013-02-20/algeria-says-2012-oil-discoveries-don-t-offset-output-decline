Oil discoveries in Algeria last year
are “important” though they won’t offset the decline in
production, the country’s energy minister said.  Algeria’s state-run energy company, Sonatrach, made 31 oil
and gas discoveries in 2012, some alone and others in tandem
with its foreign partners,  Youcef Yousfi  told reporters in
Algiers today, stressing the need for further exploration
efforts.  The El Merk field is expected to begin production this
year, and will be added to the Menzel Ledjmet East fields that
have been operational for almost one month, he said without
elaborating.  The country  produced  1.2 million barrels of crude a day
last month, according to a monthly OPEC production survey
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down from an average of 1.26
million in the four years ended 2012, and 1.4 million in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
