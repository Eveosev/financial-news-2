The  U.S. Meat Export Federation  said
it will ask China, the third-biggest buyer of American pork, to
delay a new layer documentation that shipments are free of the
additive ractopamine.  The quarantine service sent a letter to U.S. officials in
Beijing this week stating that U.S. pork imports need further
paper work certifying they are free of the additive, which is
used to make meat leaner,  Joel Haggard , the group’s Asia-Pacific
vice president, said by telephone today. With some consignments
on their way, the March 1 deadline for changes can’t be met and
should be rolled back, he said.  China, the world’s largest consumer of pork, already bans
ractopamine and there have been no problems reported with U.S.
in recent months, Haggard said.  “You want to make sure you get it right, but we just don’t
have the details yet as to exactly what’s required,” he said,
speaking while waiting to board a flight from Hong Kong to
Beijing.  Hogs futures in Chicago fell 0.3 percent to 82.775 cents a
pound at 8:09 p.m. Beijing time, declining for a sixth day.  China imported 8,953 tons of pork from the U.S. in
December, according to the Beijing-based customs authority. The
data doesn’t account for the large amount of so-called variety
meats, including pig feet and ears, shunned by U.S. consumers
and popular in China, which help American hog suppliers raise
their profitability, according to Haggard.  Two telephone calls to the General Administration of Quality
Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine in Beijing were not
answered outside normal business hours.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
