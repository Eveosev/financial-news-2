Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. , the
Israeli producer of quartz-based countertops, declined from a
record after U.S. housing starts dropped more than forecast and
the nation’s largest luxury homebuilder’s earnings missed
analyst estimates.  Caesarstone slumped 9.4 percent to $22.61 in New York, the
biggest decline since the company’s March debut. Shares reached
a record $24.95 yesterday and have rallied 106 percent since
March 21, the second-most successful foreign IPO in the U.S.
over the past 12 months.  Total  housing starts  in the U.S., Caesarstone’s second-
biggest market, dropped to an 890,000 rate, lower than the
920,000 median estimate from 85 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Homebuilder  Toll Brothers Inc.  posted net income of 3 cents a
share for the quarter ended Jan. 31, less than the 10-cent
average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Many building products companies and U.S. housing-related
companies are down today because the Census Bureau released new
home construction data that was below analysts’ consensus,”
David Kirshenbaum, a New York-based analyst at Baron Capital,
the fourth-largest  holder  of Caesarstone with about 1.2 million
shares, said by e-mail.  U.S. revenue for Caesarstone grew 45 percent in 2012 to
$86.8 million, making it the company’s fastest growing region
and second-biggest market after Australia, Chief Executive
Officer  Yosef Shiran  said on a conference call on Feb. 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
