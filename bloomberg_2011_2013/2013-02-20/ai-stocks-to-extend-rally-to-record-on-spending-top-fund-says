Thailand’s best-performing  fund  this
year is forecasting the benchmark  stock index  will rally a
further 17 percent to a record in 2013 as government
infrastructure spending boosts earnings.  The SET Index may climb to 1,800, according to  Prapas Tonpibulsak , chief investment officer at Krungsri Asset
Management Co. Ltd. Prapas’s  Krungsri Star Equity Dividend Fund 
has advanced 22 percent this year, the best performer among 196
Thailand-based equity funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Fund researcher  Morningstar Inc.  last year  ranked  two
of Krungsri’s equity funds the nation’s best. The benchmark Thai
gauge gained 0.6 percent to 1,532.07 yesterday, the highest
close since November 1994.  “Strong earnings growth and public spending still provide
sound fundamentals for further gains to catch up with other
regional peers,” Prapas, who helps oversee about $5.1 billion
of assets at Krungsri, said in a phone interview from Bangkok
today. “Thai equities can be more expensive, even as their
valuations reach the overbought level.”  The  SET  has gained 10 percent this year to its highest
level in more than 18 years as Southeast Asia’s second-biggest
economy rebounds from the worst flooding in almost 70 years in
2011. The measure trades at 14.1 times estimated earnings,
compared with 19.2 times in the Philippines, 14.8 times in
Indonesia and 14.4 times in Malaysia.  Earnings  of listed
 companies  will grow by about 17 percent this year, Prapas said.  Gross domestic product grew a more-than-expected 18.9
percent in the fourth quarter on rising exports and domestic
demand, the government said Feb. 18.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra plans to award contracts
worth 350 billion baht ($11.7 billion) for flood prevention and
water management projects this year. The government in March
will consider a plan for a 2 trillion-baht investment in
infrastructure projects including highways and high-speed
trains, Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said on Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
