Teva Pharmaceuticals  and  Gilead
Sciences Inc.  agreed to settle a patent dispute over Viread, a
treatment for HIV infection and chronic Hepatitis B, avoiding a
trial that was scheduled to start today, Gilead said.  Teva will be permitted to begin sales of a generic version
of Viread on Dec. 15, 2017, Gilead said in a statement
distributed by Business Wire.  “We believe strongly in the validity of our intellectual
property,”  John Milligan , Gilead’s president, said in the
statement yesterday. “This settlement, however, removes some
uncertainty and minimizes further distraction.”  Gilead, based in Foster City, California, sued Teva in 2008
and again in 2010, claiming that Teva’s applications to the  U.S.
Food and Drug Administration  to make drugs to treat HIV
infections in adults infringed four of its patents. The trial in
New York has been adjourned until the completion of the
settlement agreement, Gilead said.  Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, had said in court
papers that Gilead’s patents were invalid and therefore couldn’t
be infringed.  The case is Gilead Sciences v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA,
10-01796, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
