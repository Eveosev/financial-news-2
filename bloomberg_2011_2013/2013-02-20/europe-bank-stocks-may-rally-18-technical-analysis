The  Stoxx 600 Banks Index , a measure
of shares in European lenders, may rally as much as 18 percent
in the next three months if it can breach its highest level this
year, according to a technical analyst at Natixis SA.  The gauge may extend its advance to a first resistance
level of 194.34 in the next two months if it can break through
its intraday high of 180.06 reached on Jan. 30,  Ouri Mimran  said
in a telephone interview from Paris today. The index may then
climb to 209.80, an 18 percent jump from yesterday’s close.  “Upside potential for banking stocks over the next few
weeks remains intact,” Mimran said. “We’re seeing European
banks holding nicely above the support trendline at 173.70, not
far away from its recent high. Breaching through that level
would signal a new upward wave.”  The measure, which includes  HSBC Holdings Plc  and Banco
Santander SA, has rallied 46 percent since it reached the lowest
level of 2012 on June 4 as the European Central Bank committed
to an unlimited bond-buying program and U.S. lawmakers agreed on
a compromise federal budget.  A pullback below the level of 173.70 would signal a
consolidation in one to two weeks, “but that will not
invalidate completely our scenario,” Mimran said.  In technical analysis, investors study charts of trading
patterns and prices to predict changes in a stock, commodity,
currency or index. Analysts identify resistance levels, or
ceilings limiting further gains, and supports, which act as
floors in a declining market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
