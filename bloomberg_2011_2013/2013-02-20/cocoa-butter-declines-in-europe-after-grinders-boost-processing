The price of cocoa butter relative
to that of beans, which gained 65 percent last year, fell in
Europe in the past month as processors boosted output, according
to three traders who have direct knowledge of the sales.  The cost of cocoa butter relative to the price of beans, or
the so-called butter ratio, was 1.80 to 1.85 times cocoa futures
on the NYSE Liffe exchange, said the traders, who asked not to
be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to the
media. The ratio was 2.05 to 2.1 a month ago.  Delfi Cocoa (Europe) GmbH, owned by Singapore-based Petra
Foods Ltd., is increasing processing at its Hamburg plant after
a six-month slowdown, Karel Menu, the company’s managing
director, said on Jan. 7. Cargill Inc., the U.S.’s largest
closely held company, started to increase grindings after
cutbacks last year,  Jos de Loor , president of the cocoa and
chocolate unit, said Nov. 21. Barry Callebaut AG said in
December it agreed to buy Petra Foods’s cocoa ingredients unit.  “After some tightening since late last year, cocoa butter
ratios have fallen below 2 in Europe this month and are also
lower in Asia, implying decent supply hitting the market,”
 Aakash Doshi , a strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York, wrote
in a report dated Feb. 15.  Cocoa Processing  Global cocoa bean processing will be 4.05 million metric
tons in the 2012-13 season that started Oct. 1, Citigroup
estimated in a report dated Feb. 15. Production will be 4.05
million tons, leaving the world with a shortage of 50,000 tons,
Doshi estimated. Ivory Coast and Ghana, which account for 58
percent of the world’s output, will produce together 2.37
million tons, the bank forecasts.  Cocoa from Ivory Coast, the world’s largest producer, is at
a premium in Europe of 42.50 pounds ($65) above Liffe prices,
according to the midpoint of the estimates of the three traders.
That is little changed from a month ago. The traders provided
ranges of 35 pounds to 50 pounds now compared with 40 pounds to
45 pounds a month ago.  Beans from Ghana, the world’s second-largest producer, are
82.50 pounds above the exchange price, the midpoint of the
trader estimates. That’s up from 77.50 pounds a month ago. The
ranges were 80 pounds to 85 pounds now compared with 75 pounds
to 80 pounds a month ago.  Cocoa for delivery in March rose 0.2 percent to 1,402
pounds by 4:41 p.m. today in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
