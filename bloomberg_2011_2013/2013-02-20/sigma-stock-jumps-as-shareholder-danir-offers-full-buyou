Sigma AB , a Swedish information-
technology and consulting company, soared the most in almost
four years after shareholder Danir AB said it will buy remaining
stock at 25 percent more than yesterday’s closing price.  Sigma  surged 24 percent to 6.7 kronor, the biggest intraday
increase since April 2009, and was trading 23 percent higher at
12:26 p.m. in Stockholm, lifting the market value to 578 million
kronor ($92 million). Danir, which already owns 28.3 percent of
the capital and 31.4 percent of the votes in Sigma, is the
biggest investor. It’s planning a bid of 6.75 kronor a share.  “Our experience in running a private company long-term is
good,”  Dan Olofsson , chairman of Sigma and owner of Danir, said
in a  statement . “The offer is independent of the level of
shareholder agreement, and it’s Danir’s goal to buy all of
Sigma.”  Management at Gothenburg-based Sigma will be able to better
focus on developing the company under private ownership, and
costs related to the company’s listing on the stock exchange
would be eliminated, Danir said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
