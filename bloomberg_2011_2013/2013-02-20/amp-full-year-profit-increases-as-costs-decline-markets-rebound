  AMP Ltd. , the Australian pension
provider, said full-year profit climbed 2.3 percent on tighter
cost controls and a recovery in global markets.  Net income  rose to A$704 million ($721 million) in the year
to Dec. 31 from A$688 million in the year earlier, AMP said in a
statement today. Underlying profit, which removes merger-related
costs and some of the influence of market volatility, gained 5.1
percent to A$955 million.  Chief Executive Officer  Craig Dunn  has focused on reducing
costs as Europe’s debt crisis eroded investor confidence. AMP
shares have risen 13 percent this year while the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index has gained 9.7 percent.  AMP’s “repositioning for higher growth is delivering, with
strong cost disciplines,”  Daniel Toohey , analyst at  Morgan
Stanley  said before the announcement. “We back AMP to deliver 3
percent cost savings, over and above its synergies and expect
strong cost discipline.”  The company’s cost to income ratio was 47.3 percent in
2012, down from 47.9 percent in the prior year, AMP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
