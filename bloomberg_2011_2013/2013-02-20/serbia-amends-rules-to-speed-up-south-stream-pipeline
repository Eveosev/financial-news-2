Serbia adopted a law allowing the
venture of state-owned Srbijagas JP and Russia’s  OAO Gazprom  to
quickly gain control of land needed to build its section of the
 South Stream  natural gas pipeline.  Lawmakers passed the bill today allowing South Stream
Serbia DOO to take over some 10,000 lots across Serbia, without
having to haggle with owners over compensation. Any plot of land
along the 470-kilometer (290-mile) route may become eminent
domain in 30 days upon the company’s request, and the value will
be based on tax authority’s assessments, according to the  law .  South Stream is “the first and unique project of this kind
and size” in Serbia and rules had to change to meet deadlines
agreed with the Russian partner, according to the text. The 1.7
billion-euro ($2.3 billion) Serb section should open in 2015.  The pipe will diversify Serbia’s gas imports that now come
only from Hungary via Ukraine, and may bring some 200 million
euros a year in transit fees, Srbijagas’ chief  Dusan Bajatovic 
said on Oct. 29. The stretch, with 40 billion cubic meters of
annual capacity, will have offshoots to Croatia, Bosnia and
Macedonia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
