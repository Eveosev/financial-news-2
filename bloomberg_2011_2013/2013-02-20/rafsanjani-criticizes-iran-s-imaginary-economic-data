Iran’s former president  Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani  criticized  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s policies and
his government’s “imaginary” economic indicators, the  Donya-e-
Eqtesad  newspaper reported.  An energy and food subsidies reform plan that started in
2010 failed to boost local production and growth, he said.
Instead, it led to an “insignificant amount of cash distributed
to the population in exchange for alarming inflation,”
Rafsanjani said, according to the daily.  “People are feeling the multiplication of prices and the
drop of the national currency’s value with their flesh and
skin,” Rafsanjani said. “Yet some are still content with their
imaginary statistics.”  Several officials and local economists have criticized the
government’s withholding of economic statistics, while the head
of parliament’s research center in 2011 said reports on the
unemployment rate were deceitful.  Iran is holding a presidential election on June 14 and
Ahmadinejad isn’t eligible to run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
