The Buffalo Sabres fired Lindy Ruff,
the National Hockey League’s longest-tenured coach.  Sabres General Manager  Darcy Regier  announced the move
today on the team’s website. Ruff, 53, was 562-452-84, along
with 78 ties, in his 15 seasons with the team.  The Sabres (6-10-1) have lost four of their last five games
and are tied with the New York Islanders and Winnipeg Jets for
the third-fewest points in the Eastern Conference. The team was
booed by spectators during its most recent home game, a 2-1 loss
to the Jets last night.  “Totally understand it,” Ruff told reporters after the
game. “I’m embarrassed.”  Ruff led the Sabres to eight playoff appearances, most
recently in 2011, and under his coaching Buffalo eclipsed the
100-point mark three times. The Sabres lost to the Dallas Stars
in the 1999 Stanley Cup finals.  Ruff’s replacement was not named in the statement.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
