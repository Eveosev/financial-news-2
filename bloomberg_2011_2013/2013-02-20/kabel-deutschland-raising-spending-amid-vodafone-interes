Kabel Deutschland Holding AG , the
German cable operator that’s the target of a potential bid by
 Vodafone Group Plc , said it will boost network spending and
raise the dividend after failing to buy a smaller competitor.  The company, based in Unterfoehring near Munich, plans to
spend an additional 300 million euros ($403 million) over two
years on its network after a plan to buy Tele Columbus Group was
foiled by Germany’s antitrust regulator. The board proposed
raising the dividend for the current fiscal year 67 percent to
2.50 euros.  Kabel Deutschland also reported earnings for the fiscal
third quarter that beat analysts’ estimates. Sales in the three
months ended Dec. 31 increased 8.8 percent to 464.8 million
euros, exceeding the 461.8 million-euro average of nine
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization jumped 10 percent
to 220.4 million euros.  “With increased confidence in the market, we see a chance
to advance network spending and to profit from its results,”
Chief Financial Officer  Andreas Siemen  said on a conference
call. “The integration of Tele Columbus would have bound up a
significant amount of resources.”  Vodafone has been waiting for the release of the results to
initiate negotiations about a takeover, a person familiar with
the matter said last week. Siemen declined to comment on a
potential offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
