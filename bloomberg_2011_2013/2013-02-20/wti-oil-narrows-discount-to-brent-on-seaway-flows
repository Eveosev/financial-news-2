West Texas Intermediate tumbled the
most in three months following declines in metals on speculation
that a commodity fund is selling positions.  WTI dropped 2.3 percent after sliding $1.95 in 12 minutes
to $93.92 a barrel at 11:07 a.m. as trading volume surged.
Silver and platinum fell with volume more than double the 100-
day moving average. Oil also decreased as gasoline futures
retreated for a second day from the highest level since
September. U.S. oil  supplies  probably rose 2 million barrels
last week as domestic output reached a 20-year high, according
to a Bloomberg survey before a government report tomorrow.  “There is a rumor that a fund is blowing up,”  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said in a telephone interview. Schork has spent 17
years in physical commodity and derivatives trading including
stints at Glencore Ltd. and Novarco Ltd., Marc Rich’s last
venture in the global energy trading, and his clients include
OPEC and major oil companies. “Metals are getting hit and it’s
spreading over to oil,” he said.  WTI for March delivery, which expired today, decreased
$2.20 to close at $94.46 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest one-day loss since Nov. 20 and the lowest
settlement since Jan. 16. The more-active April contract slid
$1.88, or 1.9 percent, to $95.22 a barrel.  The volume of all futures traded was 38 percent above the
100-day average at 4:37 p.m. Volume surged to 53 percent above
the average at 11:35 a.m. from 2.9 percent below at 10:46 a.m.
Open interest in WTI futures reached a record 1.67 on Feb. 13.  API Inventories  Prices were little changed after the American Petroleum
Institute reported oil inventories gained 2.96 million barrels
to 372.5 million last week, the highest level since Dec. 7.
April futures fell $2.32 to $94.78 a barrel in electronic
trading at 4:32 p.m. The contract was at $94.79 before the
report was released at 4:30 p.m.  “I’m hearing about some fund liquidation but nothing
concrete,” said  Kyle Cooper , director of commodities research
at IAF Advisors in Houston. “We’re also at the expiration for
the March contract. A ton of open interest has come into the
market the last two weeks and there are clearly no buyers, so
you are seeing an exit as investors have to roll.”  Steven Adamske , a Commodity Futures Trading Commission
spokesman based in Washington, declined to comment on market
fluctuations today.  Chris Grams , a Chicago-based spokesman for
Nymex’s owner CME Group Inc., said the company doesn’t comment
on specific client activity.  Fed Minutes  Oil also fell after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last
meeting showed several policy makers said the central bank
should be ready to vary the pace of their $85 billion in monthly
bond purchases.  Brent for April settlement slipped $1.92, or 1.6 percent,
to end the session at $115.60 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The volume was 7.5 percent above the
100-day average.  Silver futures for March delivery tumbled 2.7 percent to
settle at $28.622 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Platinum
for April delivery dropped 3 percent on the Comex to $1.647.10
an ounce. Silver and platinum volumes were more than double the
100-day averages at 4:37 p.m. in New York.  “You can’t just pick on crude here because there’s a broad
move away from all commodities,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut. “We’ve had a big run-up in prices recently and
sentiment is switching to risk-off. This may have been enough to
get some big macro-fund to take profits.”  Dollar Climbs  The dollar climbed against major currencies, reducing the
appeal of dollar-denominated commodities as an investment. The
U.S. currency rose 0.8 percent against the euro and reached the
highest level since 2010 against the British pound.  Prices also dropped after a Western diplomat said the five
United Nations Security Council permanent members and Germany
will make a new offer to Iran to resolve a dispute about its
nuclear program in talks next week. The diplomat, who asked not
to be more closely identified, told reporters in London today
that the offer will contain significant new elements, without
giving further details.  Stalled multilateral negotiations on Iran’s nuclear work
are scheduled to resume Feb. 26 in Kazakhstan. The U.S. and its
allies say Iran may seek to make an atomic bomb, while Iran says
developments are for civilian purposes. Sanctions aimed at
stopping the program have hindered its ability to export oil.  Iran Talks  “The Iran headlines have definitely knocked some of the
security premium out of the price,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “The dollar is higher, especially against
the pound, and I’m surprised that there’s not more downward
pressure on commodities.”  Gasoline for March delivery fell 6.17 cents, or 2 percent,
to settle at $3.0595 a gallon on the Nymex. It ended at $3.1345
on Feb. 15, the highest level since Sept. 28.  The retail price for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose to $3.766 a gallon yesterday, the  highest  level for this
time of year in AAA data going back to 2004  “Gasoline coming off is definitely helping crude come
off,” said  Tariq Zahir , a New York-based commodity fund manager
at Tyche Capital Advisors. “We haven’t seen gasoline prices at
these levels at this time of year ever and it deserves to come
off a little bit.”  Crude Supplies  U.S.  crude supplies  probably rose 0.5 percent to 374.2
million barrels last week, according to the median estimate of
11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. It would be the longest
streak of increases since May. Crude production rose to 7.06
million barrels a day in the week ended Feb. 8, the most since
December 1992, according to the EIA.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 11 a.m. tomorrow in Washington, one day later than
normal because of the Presidents Day holiday on Feb. 18.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 665,952
contracts as of 4:33 p.m. It totaled 575,423 contracts
yesterday, 10 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.65 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
