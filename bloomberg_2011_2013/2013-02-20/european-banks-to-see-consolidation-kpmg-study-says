The European banking industry is
likely to consolidate as medium-sized lenders shrink and focus
on their home markets, according to a study by accounting firm
KPMG International.  The potential change will come as banks are “pulled in
many directions at once” by capital and liquidity regulations
and corporate governance and compensation rules, KPMG said in
the report today.  “Europe’s banking industry is likely to see significant
consolidation, with the second tier likely to shrink in both
breadth and number,” said  Jeremy Anderson , global chairman of
KPMG financial-services practices in London. “The main brand
names will continue in the market, but with fewer challenger
banks emerging than might have been expected.”  European banks are already selling assets to prepare for
tougher capital rules under Basel III international standards
and slower revenue amid the sovereign debt crisis.  Rabobank
Groep , the Dutch lender, agreed yesterday to sell a controlling
stake in its asset-management unit for 1.94 billion euros ($2.59
billion) as it sheds units to help strengthen its finances amid
slowing asset growth and competition for deposits in the
Netherlands.  “Even the regulators are now worried about the volume of
regulation,” KPMG said in its report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
