The Canadian dollar weakened to the
lowest level in almost seven months against its U.S. counterpart
amid concern the world’s 11th-largest economy is slowing.  The currency fell versus a majority of its 16 most-traded
peers as crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, fluctuated and an
index of raw materials declined. Reports due Feb. 22 will show
the nation’s  retail sales  declined and inflation slowed,
according to Bloomberg News surveys of economists.  “Economic pressures are on the rise in Canada, that’s one
of the main things pressuring the loonie,”  Joe Manimbo , a
market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of
Western Union Co., said by phone from Washington. “There is
some data Friday that investors are nervous about which may
highlight growing concerns about underlying fundamentals in
Canada.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.4 percent to
C$1.0149 per U.S. dollar at 8:49 a.m. in Toronto. It touched
C$1.0156, the weakest since July 26. One Canadian dollar buys
98.53 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
