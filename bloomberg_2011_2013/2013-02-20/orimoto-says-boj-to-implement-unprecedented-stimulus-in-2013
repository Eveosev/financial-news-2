The Bank of Japan will implement
unprecedented monetary stimulus this year, BOJ board member
 Yoshihisa Morimoto  said, in comments that suggest he may think
enough is being done to end deflation and revive growth.  “This year, we will be implementing unprecedentedly large
monetary easing,” Morimoto said today in a  speech  in Kochi,
southern Japan. Japan’s monetary base is the highest among
advanced countries at 27 percent of nominal gross domestic
product, he said.  The central bank last month adopted a 2 percent inflation
target without a deadline and said it would delay open-ended
asset purchases until 2014. Investors are trying to assess Prime
Minister  Shinzo Abe ’s commitment to ending more than a decade of
deflation as he prepares to nominate a successor for BOJ
Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa .  “With this wording, Morimoto wants to show that the BOJ is
doing enough,” said  Mari Iwashita , a bond strategist at SMBC
Nikko Securities Inc. in Tokyo.  The yen reversed a slide after Morimoto’s comments, and was
trading 0.1 percent higher at 93.52 per dollar at 12:42 p.m. in
Tokyo.  The central bank currently buys securities such as
government bonds and exchange-traded funds through a fund
targeted to reach 76 trillion yen ($814 billion) in assets in
December 2013. It also has a credit loan program worth 25
trillion yen and a facility for unlimited lending to banks.  The target of all the bank’s easing programs exceeds 120
trillion yen, Morimoto said.  Shirakawa will step down on March 19 with his two deputies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
