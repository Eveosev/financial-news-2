Hedge-fund manager  David Einhorn 
said legal scrutiny of credit ratings issued by McGraw-Hill
Cos.’s Standard & Poor’s shows why that company and rival
Moody’s Corp. are vulnerable to stock slumps.  The U.S. Justice Department sued McGraw-Hill this month,
saying the ratings firm misstated the risks of mortgage bonds,
whose collapse helped trigger the credit crisis. The New York-
based company has said the lawsuit is without merit.  “The recent case against S&P is a negative for the ratings
agencies, and Moody’s is not immune,” Einhorn said today in a
conference call discussing  Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. , the
Cayman Islands-based reinsurer where he is chairman. “We are
short both Moody’s and S&P’s parent, McGraw-Hill.”  McGraw-Hill fell 1.5 percent to $45.43 at 9:43 a.m. in New
York trading. The company has declined about 17 percent this
year after rallying 22 percent in 2012. Moody’s slipped 1.3
percent to $47.92, extending its drop for the year to about 4.8
percent. Moody’s surged 49 percent last year, hurting investment
results at Einhorn’s reinsurer.  “Our biggest loser on the short side last year was
Moody’s,” Einhorn said.  Greenlight Re slipped 1.1 percent today. The company posted
a fourth-quarter loss yesterday as investments faltered and
superstorm Sandy fueled catastrophe claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
