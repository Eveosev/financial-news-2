Monica Hanson  has left her position
as Barclays Plc’s head of global finance for Latin America,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because he isn’t authorized to comment publicly.  Brandon Ashcraft , a Barclays spokesman, declined to comment
in a telephone interview from New York. Calls to Hanson’s office
were answered by an operator who said there was no one working
in the firm under her name.  Barclays is Latin America’s sixth-biggest underwriter this
year after falling to the 16th position in 2012, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 1,800 positions will be cut this year at Barclays’s
corporate and investment bank, and 1,900 positions will be
eliminated in its money-losing European consumer and business
banking unit, reversing an expansion that followed its 2008
purchase of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s U.S. unit.  Hanson moved to Lehman Brothers from JPMorgan Chase & Co.
in 2001, then joined Barclays when it bought Lehman, according
to her profile on the business networking site LinkedIn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
