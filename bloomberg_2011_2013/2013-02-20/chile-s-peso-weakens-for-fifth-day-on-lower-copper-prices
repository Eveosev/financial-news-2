The Chilean peso headed for its
longest losing streak in nine months as a decline in the price
of copper dimmed the outlook for export revenue.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 472.45 at 10:04 a.m. in
Santiago for its fifth day of losses. The currency has
depreciated every day after closing at a three-week high of
470.65 per dollar on Feb. 13.  “It’s moving in line with weaker copper prices,” Jose
Giraz, an analyst at XDirect Chile Ltda., said in a telephone
interview from Santiago.  Copper, the country’s main export product, retreated as
much as 0.5 percent in New York amid speculation of higher
inventory levels of the metal and lower physical demand from
China following the Lunar New Year holiday last week. The metal
has dropped 2.7 percent in the past five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
