Australian retail and office
property prices fell in the three months to Dec. 31 as rents
declined, a private survey showed.  Retail property capital values dropped 1.4 percent in the
last quarter of 2012, while industrial property values slipped
1.2 percent and offices weakened 0.6 percent, according to a
National Australia Bank Ltd. survey released today. Rents eased
in all markets in the period, led by a 2.1 percent decline in
retail, NAB said.  Retail sales  unexpectedly fell for a third month in
December, the longest stretch of declines in 13 years, a
government report showed Feb. 6. The Reserve Bank of Australia
cut the benchmark interest rate to 3 percent in December,
matching a half-century low, in a bid to spur non-mining areas
of the economy.  Office values will rise by 0.1 percent by the fourth
quarter of 2013, and industrial real estate will climb 0.3
percent, while retail will drop 0.2 percent, the survey of
respondents’ expectations showed. City center hotels fared best
in the three months to Dec. 31, rising 1.7 percent, with prices
expected to climb 3 percent by the fourth quarter of 2013.  NAB’s commercial property index -- which measures capital
value and rental pricing expectations based on a survey of 270
real estate brokers, property developers and investors -- rose
to minus 17 last quarter from minus 19 in the previous three
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
