Wix.com Inc. , an Israeli provider of
online tools that help people create websites, chose JPMorgan
Chase & Co. to lead its initial public offering in the U.S.,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Wix, based in Tel Aviv, will seek about $75 million in the
offering, said the people, who asked not to be named because the
plans are private. Caesarstone Sdot Yam Ltd. was the last
Israeli company to list in New York, raising $84.25 million in
its IPO a year ago. The maker of quartz-based countertops led
gains on the  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index  of the largest
Israeli companies in the U.S. yesterday, jumping 7.9 percent.  Founded in 2006, Wix joins Kamada Ltd., which makes medical
treatments, and software developer Babylon Ltd. among Israeli
companies looking to list in the U.S., after  Caesarstone ’s 127
percent surge since its March debut made it the second-most
successful foreign IPO in New York. The 24-stock Israeli-US
measure has rallied 3.1 percent in 2013, while the Nasdaq
Composite Index has gained 6.4 percent.  “The appetite for IPOs is strong,”  Linda Killian ,
portfolio manager of the Renaissance Global IPO Plus Aftermarket
Fund, which has about $10 million in assets, said by phone
yesterday. “There’s tremendous demand for tech deals, except
they need to have a differentiated product and be able to show
growth.”  Renaissance Global holds shares of Caesarstone and
 SodaStream International Ltd. , the Airport City, Israel-based
maker of home soda machines that debuted on U.S. markets in
2010. SodaStream has rallied 162 percent since its offering.
Renaissance’s IPO Plus Aftermarket  fund  has returned 14 percent
in 2013 and beaten 99 percent of its peers.  Online Platform  The Bloomberg Israel-US index rose 1.1 percent to 89.04
yesterday, climbing for the first time in four trading days.
Israel’s benchmark  TA-25 Index  added 1.4 percent to 1,241.90 in
Tel Aviv.  Wix runs an online platform that allows people to create
web pages without the need for computer-programming skills,
according to the company’s website.  Tasha Pelio , a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, declined to comment when contacted by e-mail
yesterday.  Michael Eisenberg , a Wix board member and partner at
Benchmark Capital, the venture-capital firm that invested in Wix
in 2010, also declined to comment.  Kamada, based in Nes Ziona, Israel, hired Morgan Stanley
and Jefferies Group Inc. to arrange the sale of as much as $50
million of stock in the U.S., a person familiar with the plans
said last month.  Babylon, which has lost 3.2 percent in Tel Aviv this year
through yesterday, will seek to raise $115 million in a New York
IPO, Chief Executive Officer  Alon Carmeli  said Jan. 9. Babylon
 gained  2.7 percent to 21.16 shekels, or $5.78, in Tel Aviv
today.  Slow 2012  Israeli companies have sold $417 million of stock in IPOs
globally over the past two years, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Caesarstone was the only Israeli company to undertake an
IPO in 2012, making it the slowest year for initial share sales
since 2009, when  D-Pharm Ltd.  raised $6.47 million in Tel Aviv,
the only IPO that year, the data show.  Bessemer Venture Partners and Mangrove Capital Partners SA
invested in Wix in 2007, according to the company’s website,
while Insight Venture Partners and DAG Ventures LP invested in
2011, the website shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
