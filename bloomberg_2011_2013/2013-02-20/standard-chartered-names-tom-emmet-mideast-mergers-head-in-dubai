Standard Chartered Plc , the U.K.
bank that earns most of its profit in Asia, named  Tom Emmet  head
of mergers and acquisitions in the Middle East and North Africa.  Emmet will be based in the Dubai International Financial
Center and joined the bank from  Royal Bank of Scotland , where he
was head of corporate finance and equity capital markets for the
