The Pentagon estimates furloughs of
civilian employees would cost them as much as $4.86 billion in
the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 unless the automatic budget
cuts called sequestration are averted.  Virginia would see the biggest drop in payrolls to civilian
employees of the military, with $660.9 million lost, according
to the estimate released by the Defense Department. That would
be followed by California, which would see a $419.7 million
decline; Maryland, losing $359.3 million; and Texas, losing
$290.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
