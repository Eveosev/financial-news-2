Gasoline futures retreated in New
York while retail prices in the U.S. climbed for the 34th
consecutive day.  March-delivery gasoline declined 1.2 percent. Prices rose
2.5 percent last week on concern that refinery shutdowns would
tighten supply. The  retail  price for regular gasoline, averaged
nationwide, rose 1.8 cents to $3.766 a gallon, the highest level
since Oct. 15, AAA said today on its website.  “Gasoline was overvalued,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. “Although we are in the
midst of a heavy turnaround season, refinery maintenance season
is peaking over the next few weeks and supplies are expected to
increase in March.”  March gasoline declined 3.67 cents to $3.0845 a gallon at
9:32 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange on volume that was
13 percent above the 100-day average for the time of day.  Prices at the pump have gained every day since Jan. 17,
advancing 47.3 cents.  “You’re going to see retail gas prices run up the rest of
this week as they catch up with the rise in futures and then
they should taper off,” Lipow said.  The motor fuel is the second-best performer this year on
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 materials with an 11
percent gain. Cotton has gained the most of any commodity.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 0.15 cent to $3.1821 a
gallon on the exchange on volume that was 19 percent below the
100-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
