SIX Group and Deutsche Boerse AG
will dissolve their  Scoach  joint venture for European structured
products, after the Swiss exchange terminated the agreement.  The Swiss Exchange will run the Zurich part of the business
called Scoach Swiss from June 30 and the Frankfurt unit will be
run separately, executives from both companies said.  “We want more entrepreneurial freedom to shape the
market,”  Christian Katz , chief executive officer of the Swiss
Stock Exchange said. “The two markets we united in 2007 were
quite distinct at the time and the differences have been
accentuated in the last few years.”  The two exchanges set up the platform in 2007. It
specializes in securitized derivatives, whose prices are
determined by movements of the underlying securities such as
stocks or bonds.  “We will run our markets after dissolution and the brand
situation will be discussed in the next couple of months,” Katz
said in an interview.  Andreas Preuss , deputy chief executive officer of Deutsche
Boerse, said the two companies were ending the venture as SIX
Group had asked to terminate the agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
