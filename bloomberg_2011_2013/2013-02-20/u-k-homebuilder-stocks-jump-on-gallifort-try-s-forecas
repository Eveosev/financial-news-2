Barratt Developments Plc  and  Taylor
Wimpey Plc , the U.K.’s two largest homebuilders by volume, rose
to the highest in almost five years after competitor  Galliford
Try Plc  said 2013 sales are off to a “cracking start.”  “We are very encouraged by what is happening” on the U.K.
housing market, Galliford Chief Executive Officer  Greg Fitzgerald  said in a telephone interview.  Barratt rose as much as 3.5 percent and was trading up 2.7
percent at  241 pence  at 12:43 p.m. in London, the highest since
April 2008, based on closing prices. Taylor Wimpey jumped 2.5
percent to 79.4 pence to cost the  most  since May 2008. Galliford
Try  gained  0.9 percent to 906 pence, the highest price since
November 2007. All seven stocks in the Bloomberg European EMEA
Homebuilders Index increased.  U.K. house-construction companies are reporting increasing
sales of new homes and higher average prices, resulting in
improving profitability after slumping during the global
recession in 2008.  Under the Bank of England’s six-month old Funding for
Lending Scheme, which offers incentives for financial
institutions to increase mortgage availability, loan approvals
rose to an 11-month high in December. The figure is still about
half the level of 2007.  Industry Growth  Galliford Try’s sales in the first seven weeks of 2013
averaged 0.67 housing unit per outlet a week compared with 0.46
for the entire second half of last year, Fitzgerald said. Growth
will probably continue month-on-month through May, he said. The
housing market will be sustained as demand outstrips supply,
Fitzgerald said. Industry output of 115,000 homes a year
compares with a government target of 240,000 a year, he said.  “The banks are sorting themselves out, and the government
lending schemes are helping,” Fitzgerald said. “As more
mortgage availability comes about, the housing market will
become a better place.”  The 33 percent increase in the interim  dividend  to 12 pence
a share is part of a “sustained and progressive” payout
policy, Fitzgerald said.  Revenue in the six months through December fell 9.2 percent
from a year earlier to 678.3 million pounds ($1.04 billion) as
Galliford deliberately reduced contracting activities to protect
margins, the London-based company said in a statement. Pretax
profit was almost unchanged at 32.3 million pounds. The company
is now a housebuilder with a contracting business rather than
the other way around, Fitzgerald said.  Stripping out a gain from the sale of land and charges for
an executive incentive plan a year earlier, first-half  profit 
rose 12 percent from 28.8 million pounds, Fitzgerald said.
Profitability at both the homebuilding and construction units
beat the company’s forecasts, he said.  The  Bloomberg European EMEA Homebuilders Index  rose 62
percent last year, exceeding an 8.2 percent increase in the FTSE
All-Share Index. The Homebuilders Index has advanced a further
13.5 percent this year, faster than the 9 percent gain in the
 All-Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
