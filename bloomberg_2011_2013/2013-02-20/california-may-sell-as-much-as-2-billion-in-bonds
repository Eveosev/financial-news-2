California  is looking to sell from
$1 billion to $2 billion of general-obligation bonds in coming
months, the first offerings since the most indebted state had
its credit rating raised by Standard & Poor’s.  Treasurer  Bill Lockyer  has placed two general-obligation
and two public works offerings on his  Spring calendar , though
amounts and specific dates have yet to be determined, he said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Money Moves with
Deirdre Bolton.” He said the size of the general-obligation
sales will depend on the needs of state agencies.  California’s credit rating on its general-obligation bonds
was raised one level to A by S&P on Jan. 31. The first boost
since 2006 came as tax increases championed by Democratic
Governor  Jerry Brown  and spending reductions bolstered the
state’s fiscal outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
