Hundreds of protesters in Egypt’s
coastal city of Port Said gathered near the Suez Canal for a
fourth day to demonstrate against death sentences handed down
last month against 21 people for their role in a soccer riot.  The protesters are seeking to enforce a work stoppage in
the canal area, cutting roads and preventing workers from
reaching the area.  The unrest, which hasn’t affected canal operations,
underscore the challenges confronting President  Mohamed Mursi  as
his government tries to revive an economy that’s stalled in the
two years since  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster.  Violence late last month in Port Said and two other canal
cities left more than 30 people dead and prompted Mursi to enact
emergency measures and a curfew in the areas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
