The U.S. Treasury Department said it
designated Colombian national Jose Evaristo Linares Castillo as
a narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin
Designation Act.  Linares Castillo leads a Colombia-based drug-trafficking
group that oversees the manufacturing and air smuggling of
thousands of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia and Venezuela to
the U.S., the Treasury said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
