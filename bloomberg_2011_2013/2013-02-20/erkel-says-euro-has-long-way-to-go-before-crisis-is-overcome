German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said
the euro area has a “long way” ahead before it overcomes the
three-year-old debt crisis even though measures to boost
competitiveness and cut debt are bearing fruit.  “We’ve achieved much but still have a lot of work ahead of
us,” Merkel told Germany’s  Straubinger Tagblatt/Landshuter
Zeitung  in an interview. The euro bailout funds, the fiscal pact
governing debt reduction and an agreement on mapping out joint
banking supervision are all moving forward, Merkel said.  “It’s moving ahead step by step,” Merkel said. It’s now
“high time” to achieve what the founders of the single
currency didn’t and move states toward improving competitiveness
and structural reform, Merkel told the southern German
newspapers.  Merkel declined to comment on former Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s chances in next week’s election in Italy, saying
only that reforms under Premier  Mario Monti  over the past few
months have been rewarded with market confidence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
