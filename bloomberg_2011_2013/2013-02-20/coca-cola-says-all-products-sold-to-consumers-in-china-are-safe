Coca-Cola Co. , the world’s largest
soft-drink maker, said that all of its products sold in China
are safe, after local media reported some imported items failed
to meet Chinese quality standards.  Some products, including fruit and vegetable juice
concentrates that Coca-Cola imported into China late last year,
were destroyed due to chemical contents or returned, the
Chinese-language  Economic Daily  reported on its website today,
citing the nation’s quality regulator.  The items were imported as research samples and have no
impact on Coca-Cola products sold to local consumers, Sharolyn
Choy, a Singapore-based company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
response to Bloomberg News.  Juice concentrates were “incorrectly tagged” and two
cases of Sokenbicha, a Japanese blended tea brand owned by Coca-
Cola, were returned due to lack of necessary documents for
customs clearance, Choy said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
