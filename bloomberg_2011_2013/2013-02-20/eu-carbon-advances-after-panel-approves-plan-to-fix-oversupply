European Union carbon permits gained
as much as 6.8 percent after a panel of lawmakers yesterday
approved plans to tackle an oversupply of allowances.  December futures closed up 6.4 percent at 4.98 euros
($6.65) a metric ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange.
They earlier rose as high as 5 euros. Trading volume in the
benchmark contract dropped 57 percent to 24 million tons from
yesterday’s record 56 million tons.  The European Parliament’s environment committee yesterday
approved a proposal to amend the bloc’s emissions-trading law to
explicitly allow the regulator to alter the schedule of permit
auctions. The EU market may have had a surplus of as much as 1.6
billion tons, or 80 percent of one year’s supply, at the end of
2012,  Kathrin Goretzki , an analyst at UniCredit SpA in Munich,
said in a Jan. 29 report.  Trade in  spot Phase 2 permits , whose eligibility ends April
30, dropped 84 percent to 1.2 million tons from yesterday’s
three-year high of 7.2 million tons. The EU will exchange
remaining Phase 2 permits for Phase 3 allowances some time after
the end April.  “Companies may be selling spot permits and buying futures
to avoid the bureaucracy associated with the shift from Phase 2
to Phase 3,”  Jan Fousek , head of trading at Virtuse Energy sro
in Prague, said by e-mail today. They may also be selling spot
permits to generate cash rather than borrow at commercial
interest rates, he said.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
slipped 2 euro cents, or 5.7 percent, to close at 33 cents a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
