Sony Corp. (6758)  predicted a 115 billion-
yen ($1.2 billion) gain following the sale of a stake in health-
care data provider  M3 Inc. (2413)  as it sheds assets and tries to avoid
a fifth straight annual loss.  The TV maker sold 6 percent of M3 to Deutsche Bank AG’s
securities arm for 14.2 billion yen ($152 million), according to
a  statement  today. Most of Sony’s gain from the deal will come
from a revaluation of its remaining holdings in M3, the Tokyo-
based  company  said yesterday.  Sony will book the gain this quarter, along with the profit
from the $1.1 billion sale of its  New York  offices. The deals
suggest  Japan ’s biggest consumer-electronics exporter is banking
on about 180 billion yen of profit from asset sales to achieve
its annual net income target of 20 billion yen, according to
Hideki Yasuda, an Ace Securities Co. analyst.  “This gives the impression that the company is desperate
to be in the black,” he said yesterday. “I’m surprised by the
size of the loss at its core electronics business.”  The maker of Bravia TVs is heading for a ninth straight
annual loss in the business amid slowing demand and competition
from  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Sony’s Xperia smartphone and tablet
also are struggling to keep pace with sales of Apple Inc.
devices.  M3, which provides online data for doctors, fell the most
in almost two years in  Tokyo  trading, dropping 5.3 percent to
153,500 yen. Sony declined 1.8 percent to 1,331 yen. The company
sold 95,000 shares in Tokyo-based M3.  Accounting Gain  Most of Sony’s gain from the sale will be triggered by its
holdings dropping below 50 percent. That will let electronics
maker treat its remaining 49.8 percent stake differently for
accounting purposes.  Sony, which also yesterday unveiled the PlayStation 4
video-games console, earlier this month reported a nine-month
net loss of 50.9 billion yen. It reiterated its full-year profit
forecast of 20 billion yen. The target included the expected
gain from the M3 deal, Sony said yesterday. Still, the
prediction is being revaluated in light of the sale and other
factors, it said.  Sony expects a profit of about $685 million from the sale
of its U.S. headquarters to investors led by Chetrit Group, it
said last month. Chief Executive Officer  Kazuo Hirai  has also
agreed to sell a chemical unit and stakes in display-making
ventures this fiscal year as he sharpens Sony’s focus on mobile
devices, games and digital imaging.  The company said Feb. 7 it was looking at possible asset
sales, some of which were included in its full-year forecast,
after previously selling land, buildings, businesses and
securities holdings.  Sony may fetch 100 billion yen selling its 25-story office
building in Tokyo, Reuters reported Jan. 10, citing people with
direct knowledge of the plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
