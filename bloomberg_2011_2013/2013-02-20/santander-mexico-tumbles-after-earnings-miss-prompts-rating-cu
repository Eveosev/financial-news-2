Grupo Financiero Santander Mexico
SAB , the Mexican unit of Spain’s biggest bank, fell the most on
the MSCI Mexico Index after Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the
stock, citing disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.  Shares plunged 5.8 percent to 36.19 pesos at the close of
Mexico City trading, extending this year’s decline to 13
percent. Today’s drop was the biggest among the 26 members of
the MSCI gauge.  Fourth-quarter profit fell 57 percent from a year earlier
to 3.31 billion pesos ($259 million), falling short of the
average estimate for 4.15 billion pesos among two analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg, as provisions for bad loans increased and
operating expenses rose, the bank said in a report Feb. 18.
Morgan Stanley cut its rating for Santander Mexico’s  American
depositary receipts  from the equivalent of buy to hold, citing
an unattractive earnings outlook, according to a report today.  The results were “weak,” UBS strategist Philip Finch
wrote in a report dated today. Credit Suisse analysts led by
 Marcelo Telles  called the earnings “disappointing” in a note
released Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
