The U.S. needs to be careful that
exports of liquefied natural gas are in the national interest
and don’t threaten the country’s cheap gas prices,  Eastman
Chemical Co.  Chief Executive Officer Jim Rogers said.  “We love exports,”  Rogers  said today on Bloomberg
Television’s “Surveillance” with Tom Keene and Sara Eisen.
“What we want to be careful, though, is that we don’t give away
some natural advantage that the U.S. has.”  Rogers has restarted mothballed factories in Longview,
Texas, as new drilling techniques boost production from shale
formations, cutting prices for natural gas liquids used to make
ethylene and related plastics. Dow Chemical Co. has said
unfettered gas exports would increase manufacturing costs and
jeopardize U.S. manufacturing investments.  “There will be some exports of LNG, but we should be
careful to make sure it’s in the national interest when we
approve additional exports,” Rogers said.  Eastman, based in Kingsport, Tennessee, and Dow are members
of America’s Energy Advantage, which advocates cheap natural gas
to stimulate U.S. manufacturing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
