Commodities fell, capping the
biggest loss in more than two months, as metals and energy
tumbled amid speculation that a hedge fund was selling.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
declined 1.1 percent to settle at 668.28 at 3:49 p.m. New York
time, the largest drop since Dec. 6. Silver futures led the
losses, retreating as much as 4 percent. Crude oil fell the most
since November, and gold slumped to $1,558.10 an ounce, the
lowest since July.  “You have a sort of mini perfect storm hitting commodities
today,”  Dave Lutz , the head of exchange-traded fund trading and
strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a
telephone interview. “There’s market chatter that a fund is
blowing up, gold has fallen below $1,600, and oil storage tanks
in Cushing are near all-time records.” Cushing, Oklahoma, is
the delivery point for New York oil futures and the main U.S.
stockpile site.  West Texas Intermediate oil for March delivery, which
expires today, decreased 2.3 percent to settle at $94.46 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. U.S. supplies
probably rose 2 million barrels through Feb. 15 as domestic
production increased, according to a Bloomberg survey before a
government report tomorrow.  Gold futures for April delivery slipped 1.6 percent to
close at $1,578 an ounce on the Comex in New York. The price
dropped for the fifth straight session, the longest slump since
December 2011.  Trading volumes for silver, platinum and palladium were
more than double the average in the past 100 days for this time
of day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
