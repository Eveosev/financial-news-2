Blackstone Group LP  plans to sell
almost 8,000 German apartments it bought in 2012 as the company
seeks to profit from rising property prices, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  The homes are valued at about 400 million euros ($536
million), said the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. Blackstone, based in New
York, acquired the homes after the owner, Level One, defaulted
on its debt. Most of them are in Berlin, according to one of the
people. A London-based spokesman for Blackstone declined to
comment.  Blackstone, the largest manager of real estate private
equity funds, is trying to profit from demand for German homes
as investors look for alternatives to lower-yielding fixed-
income assets. Berlin apartments have been among the biggest
gainers, with values rising 8 percent in 2012, according to data
compiled by Berlin-based online broker  ImmobilienScout.   Level One was placed in insolvency administration in August
2008 owing creditors about 1.3 billion euros. At the time,
Blackstone helped reorganize the German property investor’s
debt.  In 2012, Blackstone acquired about two thirds of the 21,000
apartments and 700 commercial properties formerly owned by Level
One for about 450 million euros.  The sale is drawing interest from buyers because it’s the
largest German home portfolio on offer after Bayerische
Landesbank’s Bavarian GBW portfolio, said one of the people.
Those properties are valued at about 2.4 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
