Crude oils produced in the Gulf of
Mexico strengthened on the spot market as March oil futures
contracts expired on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Spot market activity was light as traders covered positions
and balanced their books before the futures expired today and
before the Feb. 22 scheduling deadline for March pipeline
delivery.  The last days of spot trading before the cutoff are
typically characterized by light volume and erratic pricing.  Light Louisiana Sweet  oil strengthened 20 cents to $22 a
barrel above WTI in Cushing at 2:29 p.m. in New York, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet ’s premium
gained 55 cents to $22.25 a barrel.  Poseidon ’s premium rose $1 to $17.90 a barrel over WTI,
while  Southern Green  increased $1.25 to a $16-a-barrel premium.  Mars Blend  advanced 65 cents to $17.25 above Brent, while
 Bonito Sour  strengthened 50 cents to a $19.50 premium.  In New York, West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for
March delivered settled down $2.20 at $94.46 a barrel amid a
broader decline in commodity prices because of speculation that
a commodity fund was selling positions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
