Germany got bids for 5.032 billion
euros of 10-year bonds, compared with a 5 billion-euro target,
the Bundesbank said in a statement.  The nation sold 4.04 billion euros of the debt at an
average yield of 1.66 percent, the central bank said. That
compares with a yield of 1.56 percent at the previous auction on
Jan. 16 and was the highest since April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
