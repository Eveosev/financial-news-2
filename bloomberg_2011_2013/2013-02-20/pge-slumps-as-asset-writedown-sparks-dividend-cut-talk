PGE SA , Poland’s largest utility,
plunged to a record on speculation the state-controlled company
will reduce dividend after an asset writedown.  The shares  fell  as much as 7.2 percent to 15.95 zloty, the
lowest intraday level since its debut on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange in November 2009, and traded 4 percent lower at 16.51
zloty as of 10:46 a.m., valuing the company at 30.9 billion
zloty ($10 billion). The benchmark WIG20 Index fell 0.3 percent.  PGE, whose Polish power plants have total capacity of 13.1
gigawatt, wrote down the value of its 1,547-megawatt Dolna Odra
facility by 1.49 billion zloty ($481 million), the Warsaw-based
company said in a regulatory filing yesterday. That will cut its
2012 net income by 1.21 billion zloty and earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 1.52 billion
zloty, it said.  Dolna Odra, a coal-fired power plant, “isn’t profitable at
current electricity prices,”  Robert Maj , an analyst at KBC
Securities in Warsaw, said in a note today. “The write-offs can
potentially threaten the dividend payout from 2012.”  Malgorzata Koziel, a spokeswoman for PGE, declined to
comment on the dividend when reached by phone today.  Falling Prices  The average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 21  analysts 
before the writedown announcement was for 2012 profit of 4.3
billion zloty, compared with 4.94 billion zloty in 2011. The
company may pay a  dividend  of 1.37 zloty a share, compared with
1.83 zloty paid last year, according to a Bloomberg forecast.  “The writedowns show that current electricity prices may
force other utilities to follow suit,” Tomasz Duda, a Warsaw-
based analyst at Ipopema Securities SA, said by phone today. “A
payout from PGE is still possible, but undoubtedly dividends
from Polish utilities will shrink.”  State-controlled Tauron Polska Energia SA, PGE’s largest
competitor,  declined  2.2 percent to 4.43 zloty today, falling
for a second day. Pawel Gniadek, a Tauron spokesman, declined to
comment on possible writedowns when reached by phone today.  Polish baseload electricity for next year has dropped 16
percent in 2012, the most among any country in the European
Union, and lost a further 7.7 percent this year as declining
consumption eroded profit margins. At the same time, the
nation’s 2012 power demand declined for the first time in three
years, according to the country’s transmission grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
