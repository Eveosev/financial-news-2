Japan Tobacco Inc . dropped in Tokyo
trading after Reuters reported the government will begin selling
shares it owns in the company within days.  Asia’s largest cigarette maker by market value fell 1
percent to 2,895 yen at the close in Tokyo, after dropping as
much as 5.9 percent. Bankers met yesterday on details of the
share sale, Reuters reported, citing sources close to the deal.  The former tobacco monopoly has gained 19 percent this year
in Tokyo trading, surpassing an 10 percent gain in the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. A law passed in 2011 allows the
Ministry of Finance, which owns about 50 percent of Japan
Tobacco, to sell one-third of its entire holding to help pay for
earthquake rebuilding.  The maker of Mild Seven cigarettes has said it plans to buy
back 250 billion yen of the shares to be sold while the rest
will be marketed to investors.  The Finance Ministry hasn’t made a decision on the share
sale as yet, according to a government official who asked not to
be named. Japan Tobacco spokesman Hideyuki Yamamoto declined to
comment on the timing of the share sale.  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
were selected by the Japanese government to lead the global
sale, the ministry said in June. Mizuho Securities Co. will help
manage the offering in Japan and JPMorgan Chase & Co. will
assist with the sale abroad, it said.  The ministry decided not to sell the stake last year due to
weak economic conditions and political uncertainty, a ministry
official said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
