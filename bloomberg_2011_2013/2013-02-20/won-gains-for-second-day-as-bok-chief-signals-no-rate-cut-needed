The won rose for a second day as the
central bank chief said an improved global outlook boosts the
odds of South Korea exceeding 2013 growth forecasts, signaling
further monetary easing isn’t needed for now.  The currency advanced and government bonds fell as overseas
funds bought $76 million more local shares than they sold
yesterday, taking inflows this month to $636 million, exchange
data show. Bank of Korea Governor  Kim Choong Soo  said in an
interview yesterday Asia’s fourth-largest economy is likely to
grow 2.8 percent and liquidity is “abundant.” South Korea must
control currency volatility and moves arising from speculative
investment, he said at a meeting in Seoul today.  “Foreign equity inflows are supporting the won,” said Sun
Sung In, analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp. in Seoul. “Still,
officials including Governor Kim have warned about volatility
and that will likely limit further gains.”  The won climbed 0.3 percent to 1,078.40 against the dollar
as of 10:35 a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It gained 1.6 percent last week, the biggest five-day
advance since the period ended Dec. 2, 2011. The Kospi index of
shares gained 0.6 percent.  One-month implied volatility for the won, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, fell
21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 6.86 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Reflect Fundamentals  Governor Kim said today the exchange rate must reflect
market fundamentals.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent notes due 2017 rose
one basis point to 2.82 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices
show.  The central bank kept the benchmark  seven-day repurchase
rate  at 2.75 percent on Feb. 14 after cuts of 25 basis points
each in July and October. For a second month, the decision
wasn’t unanimous. In January, BOK board member Ha Sung Keun
called for a rate cut to curb excessive appreciation of the won
and support the weak economy.  South Korea’s external debt maturing in one year or less
dropped to $126.7 billion at the end of last year from $132.6
billion at the end of the third quarter, the Bank of Korea said
in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
