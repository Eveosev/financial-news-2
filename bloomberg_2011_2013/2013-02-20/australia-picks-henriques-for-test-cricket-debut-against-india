Moises Henriques will make his Test
cricket debut for Australia in the series opener against India
after being chosen ahead of Glenn Maxwell as the all-rounder.  Portugal-born Henriques, who was called up to the squad for
the home series against Sri Lanka without being used in the 3-0
sweep, was picked after taking five wickets with his medium-pace
bowling and scoring 49 runs in Australia’s two warm-up matches
in India.  “I still have a lot of memories of myself in the backyard
emulating all the Test cricketers back in the day,” Henriques,
26, said in comments distributed by Cricket Australia. “It’s
everything I ever wanted to do. It’s just an amazing feeling.”  Australia chose James Pattinson,  Peter Siddle  and Mitchell
Starc as its pacemen alongside specialist spin bowler Nathan
Lyon for the first Test in Chennai starting in two days.  Shane Watson  will play as a specialist batsman.  The teams are scheduled to play four Tests, with matches
following in Hyderabad, Mohali and Delhi.  AUSTRALIA: Michael Clarke (captain), Ed Cowan, Moises
Henriques, Phil Hughes, Nathan Lyon, James Pattinson, Peter
Siddle, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, David Warner, Shane
Watson.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
