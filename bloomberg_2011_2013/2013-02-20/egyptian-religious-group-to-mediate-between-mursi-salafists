Egyptian Islamist group Al-Gamaa Al-
Islamiya received backing from President Mohamed Mursi to
mediate in the dispute between the presidency and the Salafi Al-
Nour party.  The move aims at easing the row with the party after the
dismissal of the president’s Salafi adviser Khaled Alam El-Din,
Nasr Abdel Salam, head of Al-Gamaa’s political arm, the Building
and Development Party, said by phone today.  Alam El-Din had reacted angrily to being fired as a Mursi
adviser, and another member of the Nour Party quit as aide to
the president in sympathy.  The row risks depriving Mursi of an ally amid opposition
pressure to form a unity government and amend the Islamist-
drafted constitution. The Nour party, representing Salafists who
follow an ultra-orthodox brand of Islam, finished second in the
last parliamentary election behind the Muslim Brotherhood’s
party, which Mursi led before becoming president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
