Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC , the
third-biggest lender in the United Arab Emirates by assets,
climbed to the highest level in more than four years amid a
share-buyback program.  The  shares gained  3.2 percent to 3.93 dirhams, the highest
close since Sept. 2008. The bank bought back 391,907 shares
today at 3.85 dirhams and 723,782 shares yesterday at 3.81
dirhams, according to regulatory filings.  ADCB was the third-biggest gainer on the  benchmark ADX
General Index , which rallied 1.6 percent today. The bank said
last month it would pay a 25 percent cash dividend for 2012
compared with 20 percent the year earlier after fourth-quarter
net income rose 19 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “The interest is as a result of starting the share-
buyback program yesterday and today, giving investors comfort
and support for current levels,” said  Marwan Shurrab , vice-
president at Dubai-based Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  The stock has surged 31 percent so far this year, outpacing
the 14 percent gain of Abu Dhabi’s benchmark index. Five
 analysts recommend  investors buy ADCB shares, five have a hold
rating on the stock, while two say sell, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The lender said Feb. 14 it would hold investor meetings in
Europe and Asia for a possible dollar bond sale. It mandated
Barclays Plc, ING Groep NV, JPMorgan Securities, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and itself
as joint lead managers and book-runners.  ADCB’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 76 today. A
reading above 70 indicates to some investors that the security
is poised to drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
