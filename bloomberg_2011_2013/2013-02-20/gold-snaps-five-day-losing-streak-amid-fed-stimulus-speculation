Gold advanced, snapping a five-day
losing run, on speculation that the U.S. central bank may
prolong stimulus in the world’s largest economy amid a weaker-
than-expected recovery.  Spot gold gained as much as 0.3 percent to $1,609.25 an
ounce and was at $1,607.40 at 2:03 p.m. in Singapore before the
release later today of minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest
policy meeting. The price dropped to $1,598.23 on Feb. 15, the
lowest since Aug. 15. Bullion for April delivery rose 0.2
percent to $1,606.70 an ounce on the Comex as the dollar fell.  While claims for  jobless  benefits in the U.S. have declined
this month, industrial production shrank in January. Confidence
among U.S. homebuilders dropped in February from a more than
six-year high, according to a report yesterday. The Federal Open
Market Committee will release minutes from the Jan. 29-30
meeting, which may detail members’ views on the timeframe for
ending debt purchases, known as quantitative easing.  “Economic problems haven’t gone away and they won’t go
away anytime soon,” said  Gavin Wendt , a director at Mine Life
Pty in Sydney. “People are looking for whether the economy is
standing on its own two feet, and what is the Fed doing in terms
of pulling back.”  Gold has slumped 4.1 percent this year on signs economies
from the U.S. to China are improving, and after filings showed
billionaire investors including  George Soros  pared holdings last
quarter. The run of five daily losses to yesterday was the worst
streak since January 2011.  Members Divided  The minutes of the Fed’s Dec. 11-12 meeting, released on
Jan. 3, showed members were divided between a mid- or end-of-
year end to easing. The central bank said in a statement after
the January meeting that it’s still committed to buying about
$85 billion of government and mortgage securities a month.  The  Dollar Index , a gauge against six counterparts,
declined as much as 0.2 percent today, dropping for a second day.
Gold usually trades counter to the U.S. currency.  Cash  bullion  of 99.99 percent purity fell 0.4 percent to
325.64 yuan a gram ($1,622.80 an ounce) on the Shanghai Gold
Exchange. Most-active futures dropped 0.2 percent to 29,983
rupees per 10 grams ($1,724.56 an ounce) on the Multi Commodity
Exchange of India Ltd.  Platinum  for immediate delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1,687.50 an ounce. Silver for immediate delivery climbed 0.3
percent to $29.5631 an ounce. Palladium was little changed at
$764.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
