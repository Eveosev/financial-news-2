The Philippine peso slipped for a
third day on concern the central bank will intervene to curb its
advance. Government bonds due 2037 were unchanged.  The central bank will maintain a strategic presence in the
foreign-exchange market and adopt prudential measures to ensure
the exchange rate is aligned with fundamentals, Governor Amando
Tetangco said Feb. 15. The peso has advanced 4.6 percent in the
past year, the best performance among Asia’s 11 most-active
currencies. The country recorded a balance of payments surplus
of $2 billion in January, compared with $640 million the month
before, the central bank reported yesterday.  “The market is a little bit more cautious as the central
bank has been signaling intervention,” said  Saktiandi Supaat ,
head of foreign-exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in
Singapore. “The peso has already moved a lot.”  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 40.655 per dollar in Manila,
according to prices from from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 40.55 on Jan. 14 and Feb. 14, the strongest level since
March 2008.  “The BOP surplus is reiterative of our stance that the
peso will strengthen this year,” said  Leong Sook Mei , the
Southeast Asian head of global markets research at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in Singapore. “But we don’t expect it
to run at the same pace as last year. The central bank has made
it clear that it doesn’t want the currency to gain as much.”  The peso has advanced 1.1 percent against the dollar this
year after rallying 6.8 percent in 2012, the most since 2007.  One-month implied volatility in the peso, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 3.85
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037 held
at 4.87 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
