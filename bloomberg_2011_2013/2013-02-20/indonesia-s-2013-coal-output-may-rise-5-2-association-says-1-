Coal output from Indonesia, the
world’s largest exporter of the fuel for power-stations, may
rise by 5.2 percent this year.  The country may produce 400 million metric tons as long as
prices stay above $92 a ton, Bob Kamandanu, the chairman of
Indonesian Coal Mining Association, said in an interview while
attending a conference in Singapore today. Output was 380
million in 2012.  “ Indonesian  producers managed to maintain production
growth last year amid price distress,” Kamandanu said. “If
prices range from $92 to $95 a ton this year, miners can
increase output.”  Power-station coal at the Australian port of  Newcastle , a
benchmark grade for Asia, fell to $94.29 a ton in 2012, from
more than $120 in 2011, according to data from IHS McCloskey.
Prices slid last year as slower economic growth in China and
Europe cut demand while Colombia, the U.S. and other exporters
increased shipments to Asia.  The group forecasts that Newcastle price will average from
$92 to $96 a ton this year, he said. The price was $92.85 a ton
in the week ended Feb. 15.  “Demand for the fuel remains high,” Kamandanu said. “We
see that India demand will pick up this year. China also
increasingly need lower grade quality for blending with their
domestic coal.”  Low-grade coal will lead growth in Indonesia’s future
supply while output of higher grade quality may be stagnant in
the coming years, he said. About 93 percent of the country’s
reserves, an estimated 28 billion metric tons in 2011, are below
top quality, according to the government’s data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
