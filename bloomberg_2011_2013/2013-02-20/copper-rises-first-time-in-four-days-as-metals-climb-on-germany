Copper gained for the first time in
four days in London after data showed an improvement in economic
sentiment in Germany, the third largest user of the metal.
Aluminum, lead and nickel also advanced.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed as much as 0.6
percent to $8,097.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $8,087.25 by 10:47 a.m. Shanghai time. It fell
to $8,038 yesterday, the lowest since Jan. 29. Nickel rose as
much as 0.9 percent to $17,540 a ton slumping after losing 5.4
percent in the first two days of this week.  German investor confidence jumped more than economists
forecast in February to the highest in almost three years. The
European Commission may say today its index of consumer
confidence improved, while in the U.S. the Federal Open Market
Committee will release minutes from the Jan. 29-30 meeting. The
Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major
counterparts, declined as much as 0.2 percent today.  “The improvement in data from Europe and the U.S. will
probably drive copper prices higher,” said Wang Jun, an analyst
at Beijing Cifco Futures Co. “There’s not much downside for
copper right now as we’re about to enter a season when
consumption usually increases.”  Copper for May delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
traded little changed at 58,740 yuan ($9,401) a ton. The May
contract on the Comex in New York gained 0.3 percent to $3.6820
per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
