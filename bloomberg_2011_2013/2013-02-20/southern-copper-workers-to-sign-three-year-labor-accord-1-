Southern Copper Corp. , the largest
producer of the metal in Peru, will sign a three-year labor
agreement this week with its workers, avoiding a potential
strike, a union leader said.  Southern Copper agreed to pay a 6.5 percent wage increase
in the first year of the accord, followed by annual 5 percent
increases, smelter union leader  Ricardo Juarez  said. Workers,
who held a two-day strike in December, had threatened another
work stoppage this month if no deal was reached.  “There are some pending issues such as health and safety,
but we’ve worked out the main points,” Juarez said in a
telephone interview from Lima. “We should sign the accord
soon.”  Workers in Peru, Bolivia and Chile have held work stoppages
at copper, zinc, iron and gold mines over the past 12 months to
push for a bigger slice of company earnings. Peru’s Mining
Federation plans a national strike this month.  Spokesman  Alberto Giles  and labor negotiator  Manuel Ramirez 
didn’t immediately return telephone calls and e-mails seeking
comment.  Southern Copper, based in Phoenix, fell 2.9 percent to
$37.49 at the close in New York.  Copper futures for May delivery declined 1.1 percent to
$3.625 a pound at 1:22 p.m. on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
