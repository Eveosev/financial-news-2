MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) , the casino
venture between a daughter of gambling mogul  Stanley Ho  and  MGM
Resorts International (MGM) , rose in Hong Kong trading after saying it
will pay a special dividend.  MGM China  climbed  as much as 5.3 percent to HK$17.80,
before closing 2.8 percent higher at HK$17.38. The company will
pay a special dividend of HK$1.02 a share, or about HK$3.87
billion ($499 million), it said in a stock exchange statement
yesterday.  Revenue rose 2 percent to $731 million, the company said.
Casino operators including MGM,  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) 
and  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  are benefiting from an increase in mainland
tourists to Macau, the only Chinese city where casinos are
legal.  MGM China’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, increased to $176
million from $174 million a year earlier. That matches the
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  The company partly controlled by  Pansy Ho , Stanley Ho’s
daughter, received government approval on Jan. 9 to build its
first resort in Macau’s Cotai area, Asia’s equivalent of the Las
Vegas Strip.  MGM plans to develop a HK$20 billion Cotai resort to draw
mass-market gamblers who provide wider profit margins than VIP
patrons. High-stakes Chinese bettors curbed spending amid a
slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy last year.  Galaxy, controlled by Hong Kong business tycoon Lui Che- woo, has said it plans to invest as much as HK$50 billion to
build the third phase of its resort in Cotai. The company
expects to begin construction at the end of this year or early
2014.  Billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s Sands China Ltd. plans to
invest at least $2.5 billion to build its fifth resort in Macau,
to be called the Parisian.  Casino revenue in Macau, the world’s largest gambling hub,
rose 14 percent to $38 billion in 2012. CLSA Ltd. expects casino
revenue in the Chinese city to top $100 billion by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
