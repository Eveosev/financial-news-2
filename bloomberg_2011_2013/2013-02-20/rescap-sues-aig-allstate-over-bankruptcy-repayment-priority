Residential Capital LLC sued AIG
Asset Management LLC, Allstate Insurance Co. and other mortgage-
bond buyers to prevent them from collecting money ahead of other
creditors in the company’s bankruptcy.  Mortgage investors who lost money on securities they bought
from ResCap shouldn’t be given priority over unsecured
creditors, ResCap said in a complaint filed Feb. 19 U.S.
 Bankruptcy Court  in  Manhattan .  The lawsuit is a response to an attempt by affiliates of
AIG, Allstate, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and
Prudential Insurance Co. of America to get paid before unsecured
creditors, ResCap said. Should the insurers succeed, they may
end up collecting twice for almost identical claims at the
expense of unsecured creditors, ResCap said.  Elevating the investor claims “will have numerous
inequitable effects,” according to the complaint.  Scott Shelley, a lawyer for the bond buyers, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail requesting comment on the
complaint.  ResCap filed for bankruptcy last year, partly to help it
resolve lawsuits brought by investors that purchased mortgage
bonds backed by $226 billion worth of home loans. The lawsuits
claimed the bonds lost value because many of the loans were bad.  Ally Settlement  ResCap and its parent company,  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , have
proposed settling with the 392 trusts that purchased the
securities by giving investors an $8.7 billion claim in ResCap’s
bankruptcy case.  Some of the entities that ResCap sued would collect money
under both that settlement and a motion that AIG, Allstate and
the other entities filed in bankruptcy court in November,
according to the complaint.  Creditors have objected to the settlement, which would
allow investors to try to collect as much as $8.7 billion,
depending on how much money ResCap raises through asset sales.
In October, the company auctioned its loan portfolio and loan-
servicing business for about $4.5 billion.  The case is In re Residential Capital LLC, 12-12020,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
