A case of  Chateau d’Yquem  2008
Sauternes sold for a record-low 1,430 pounds ($2,190) on the
London-based  Liv-ex  wine market this week, according to data on
its Cellar Watch website.  The Bordeaux dessert wine, which tops the hierarchy in
the 1855 classification for Sauternes and Barsac, sold for 16
percent below a similar transaction in February last year, and
was 27 percent down from its peak on Liv-ex in October 2011.
The same vintage sold at an  Acker Merrall & Condit  auction in
Hong Kong in January 2012 for $3,075 a case, according to
Acker’s online archive.  Editors: Peter Torday, Jim Silver  To contact the reporter on the story:
