Oil & Gas Development Co. ,
Pakistan’s biggest energy explorer, posted a 20 percent surge in
second-quarter profit after production increased.  Net income climbed to 23.6 billion rupees ($240 million),
or 5.48 rupees a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 from
19.7 billion rupees, or 4.57 rupees, a year earlier, the
Islamabad-based company said in a filing today. Sales rose 29
percent to 56.8 billion rupees.  “A backlog in development, which is now coming online, as
well as fast-track development of recent finds is helping to
improve the company’s production profile,” said  Naveed Vakil ,
director research at AKD Securities Ltd. in Karachi. “The
company is also benefiting from the decline in the Pakistani
rupee that fell nine percent in the quarter” compared with a
year earlier, he said.  Oil and Gas Development benefited from an eight percent
increase in crude production to almost 39,000 barrels a day. Gas
output also rose as much as 12 percent to 1,150 million cubic
feet a day, Vakil said.  Shares  for Oil and Gas Development fell 1.3 percent, the
most in almost three weeks, to 205 rupees at 10:21 a.m. in
Karachi. They’ve gained 7.5 percent this year, compared with a
5.3 percent increase in the benchmark KSE 100 Index. The company
plans to pay an interim cash dividend of two rupees a share.  To contact the reporters on this story:
