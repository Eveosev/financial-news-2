AGF Management Ltd . Chief Executive
Officer  Blake Goldring  said Canada should institute a mandatory
savings program.  The country faces an “extreme” savings situation,
Goldring said in a speech in Toronto today. Participation in
voluntary registered retirement savings plans and tax-free
savings accounts is too low, he said.  “Australia, Chile and Singapore have met with success
using compulsory savings programs,” said Goldring, head of the
Toronto-based mutual fund company that has more than C$40
billion ($39.3 billion) in  assets  under management.  Goldring’s call follows Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
CEO  Gerald McCaughey  encouraging Canada to create ways to allow
additional voluntary contributions to the Canada Pension Plan to
avoid declines in living standards upon retirement.  “It would give Canadians the choice to put aside more - a
little at a time - with the confidence of clearly knowing what
benefits it will bring,” McCaughey, head of Canada’s fifth-
biggest bank, said yesterday during a speech in Fredericton, New
Brunswick.  Savings products including pooled pension plans and the
tax-free savings account, introduced to Canadians in 2008, “are
all effective vehicles, but despite their attractiveness, the
participation rates for them remain woefully low,” Goldring
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
