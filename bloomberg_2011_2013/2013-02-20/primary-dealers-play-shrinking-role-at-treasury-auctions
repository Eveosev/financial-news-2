The 21 primary dealers required to
bid at government-debt auctions are playing a smaller part in
the offerings as investors buy more securities directly from the
Treasury, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  Direct bidders are on a pace to take a record amount of the
debt sold at auctions this year with awards of $54 billion, or
22 percent of the $247 billion of debt distributed through the
competitive bidding process this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with dealers, which have
taken 52 percent of the securities, and indirect bidders which
have received 26 percent of the debt. Direct bidders won a
record 15 percent of the allotments in 2012.  The composition of Treasury holders has remained stable
amid the rise in direct bidding as “investors who previously
purchased their securities in the secondary market from primary
dealers have shifted to the primary market,”  Michael Fleming , a
vice president in the New York Fed’s Research and Statistics
Group, and Sean Myers, a former undergraduate intern at the bank
and currently a student at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, wrote in a  research note  published today.  Dealers bought 56 percent of new Treasury issuance from
Sept. 15, 2008, through June 30, 2012, compared with 70 percent
from May 5, 2003, through Sept. 14, 2008, according to Fleming
and Myers.  ‘Guessing Game’  “The primary-dealer community doesn’t really have a clue
at this point what the demand is,” said  Thomas di Galoma , a
managing director at Navigate Advisors, a brokerage for
institutional investors in Stamford, Connecticut. “Every
auction is a guessing game.”  The increased  direct  demand may be having an impact on
pricing at the offerings. Auction yields were 0.2 basis point
lower than in the secondary market from September 2008 through
June 2012, according to the researchers. That compares with
yields 0.5 basis point higher than in the secondary market for
offerings from May 2003 through August 2008, excluding the
period from January 2007 through March 2008 for which data was
not available.  Dealers have seen their trading  volumes  decline at the same
time their auction allotments have waned. The average trading
volume in Treasuries in 2012 was $521.4 billion, down 8.7
percent from a record $571.3 billion in 2011, Fed data show.
That compares with average volume of $565.9 billion in 2007.  Trading activity has trailed the growth in the  supply  of
the securities, which reached $11 trillion at the end of 2012,
up from $4.5 trillion at the end of 2007, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
