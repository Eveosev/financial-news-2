Pier Luigi Bersani , the Italian
premier candidate backed by the country’s biggest labor union,
told retail sellers of newspapers and magazines to call off
plans to strike during the Feb. 24-25 general election.  “Even if I know and recognize the problems raised by kiosk
operators, I’m appealing to them to put off the strike,”
Bersani said today in a statement e-mailed by the office of his
Democratic Party. “The structural and cyclical editorial
crisis, and in general the entire information industry chain,
must be at the center of attention for the next government.”  Bersani is seeking to keep newspapers in the hands of
voters as they go to the polls. Three unions, including SNAG-
Confcommercio, are planning a three-day strike starting Feb. 24
to protest business conditions they say led to cuts of 10,000
kiosks and 20,000 jobs in the industry in recent years.  “It’s clear that this problem will be confronted,” said
Bersani. “I would therefore suggest reflecting on the strategy
of holding a protest in days that are so important for the life
of this country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
