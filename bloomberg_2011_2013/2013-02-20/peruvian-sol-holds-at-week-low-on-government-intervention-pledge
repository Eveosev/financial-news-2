Peru’s sol held at its lowest level
in a week after the government pledged this week to intervene to
stem the currency’s appreciation.  The sol closed unchanged at 2.5820 per U.S. dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency is down
1.2 percent so far in 2013, the worst start to a year since
2009. It gained 5.7 percent last year.  Finance Minister  Miguel Castilla  said Feb. 18 the
government will sell soles to purchase at least $4 billion to
help the central bank offset increased dollar inflows. The
monetary authority has bought $3.3 billion this year to stem
gains in the local currency, which according to Peru’s financial
regulator touched a 16-year high of 2.5390 on Jan. 14.  “The central bank has been very aggressive in the currency
market, and the Finance Ministry’s measures are complementing
that,” said  Rosa Bardales , an analyst at Banco Internacional
del Peru SAA. The sol will probably remain near current levels
in the coming weeks, she said.  The central bank said on its website it didn’t  buy dollars 
in the currency market today, marking the second trading day in
more than four months that it hasn’t intervened in the foreign-
exchange market.  The yield on Peru’s 7.125 percent dollar bond due in March
2019 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.17
percent at 3:59 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price fell 0.22 cent to 128.18 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
