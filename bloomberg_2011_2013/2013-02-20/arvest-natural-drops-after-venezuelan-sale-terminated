Harvest Natural Resources Inc .
dropped the most in more than 23 years after announcing the
termination of its planned $725 million sale of Venezuelan
assets to Indonesia’s state-owned  PT Pertamina .  Harvest Natural fell 41 percent to $5.45 at the close in
New York, the most since Dec. 1989.  Indonesia’s government voted not to approve Pertamina’s
purchase of Harvest Natural’s 32 percent stake in the Venezuelan
Petrodelta SA joint venture, Houston-based Harvest Natural said
in a statement today. The planned purchase also was subject to
shareholder and Venezuelan government approval.  “We are disappointed,” Harvest Natural Chief Executive
Officer  James Edmiston  said in today’s statement. “Harvest
remains committed to exploring all possible alternatives to
unlock the potential of our assets and maximize value for
shareholders.”  Afdal Bahaudin, Pertamina’s investment planning and risk
management director, declined to comment on the announcement.  Petrodelta’s six fields hold 221 million barrels of proved,
probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves, according to
Harvest Natural’s  website .  Harvest Natural also operates in China, Gabon, Oman and
Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
