Euro-area  consumer confidence 
increased to the highest in seven months in February amid signs
the economy may be  gaining strength  after slipping into a
recession last year.  An index of household confidence in the currency bloc rose
to minus 23.6 from minus 23.9 in January, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today. It was
the third straight gain after sentiment reached a 3 1/2-year low
in November. Economists had forecast a December reading of minus
23.2, according to the median of 24 estimates in a  Bloomberg
News survey .  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said this
month that confidence in the euro area has stabilized and the
ECB sees a gradual recovery beginning later this year, though
the situation is “fragile.” Investor confidence in Germany,
Europe’s largest economy, jumped to the highest in almost three
years this month, data showed yesterday.  Still, with euro-area unemployment at a record 11.7
percent, the ECB forecasts that the bloc’s economy will shrink
0.3 percent this year after a 0.5 percent contraction in 2012.
Gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter,
the worst performance since 2009.  “Even if some signs of stabilization are emerging, it
looks all but sure that domestic demand is not going to provide
any significant growth contribution this year,” said Peter Vanden Houte , an economist at ING Group NV in Brussels. “We
actually expect household consumption to contract by 0.2 percent
this year.”  Economic Growth  The appreciation of the euro, which has gained about 8
percent against the U.S. dollar in the past six months, could
also put a drag on economic growth by hampering exports.  The euro rose as high as $1.3711 on Feb. 1, the strongest
since Nov. 14, 2011. The European currency traded at $1.3384 at
4:29 p.m. in Brussels, down less than 0.1 percent on the day.  The commission is scheduled to publish the final numbers
for February consumer confidence and the wider indicator of
euro-area economic confidence on Feb. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
