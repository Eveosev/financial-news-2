Watts Water Technologies Inc., a
water products manufacturer, reported fourth-quarter revenue of
$359.2 million, “essentially flat” compared with a year-
earlier due to the weakening of the euro to the U.S. dollar.  Sales for 2012 rose 1 percent to the highest since 2008
compared with a year ago, mainly from $51.5 million of
acquisitions, the North Andover, Massachusetts-based company
said late yesterday in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
