  Insurance Australia Group Ltd. , the
Sydney-based insurer formed in 1925, said first-half profit more
than tripled as claims fell and investment income surged.  Net income  rose to A$461 million ($473 million) in the six
months to Dec. 31 from A$144 million a year earlier, IAG said
today in a statement. Analysts had predicted adjusted net profit
of A$490.3 million, according to three estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  IAG Chief Executive  Michael Wilkins  agreed to sell the
group’s ailing U.K. business to increase profits at home and
expand in Asia in December. Reduced insurance claims along with
the planned exit from the U.K. has boosted the insurer’s share
price 16 percent this year, making it the second-best performer
behind  QBE Insurance Group Ltd.  in the Australian industry.  “Post disposal of U.K., IAG is now a very clean play on
the favorable domestic general insurance business,”  Richard Coles , an analyst at  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd , said before the
announcement.  Investment income on shareholders’ funds was A$201 million,
compared with a loss of A$30 million in the same period a year
earlier, IAG said. Net natural peril claim costs fell to A$133
million from A$396 million.  IAG’s profit in the six months to Dec. 31, 2011, was
affected by claims generated by a Christmas Day storm in
Melbourne and floods in Thailand.  The insurer on Dec. 14 said it expects a net loss after tax
of about A$240 million in the year ending June 30 from the U.K.
unit. Yesterday, Brisbane-based Suncorp Group Ltd. reported a 48
percent increase in first-half net income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
