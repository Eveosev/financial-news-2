Faragalla Group, an Egyptian food
producer, said it shut down its factories yesterday after
workers stormed the complex to demand higher pay.  The plants, located near Alexandria, halted production
after they were raided by more than 200 workers, some of them
carrying swords, Chairman Mohamed Farag Amer said by phone
today. Workers had been protesting for a week, he added.
Faragalla employs more than 10,000 workers, and its revenue is
around 3 billion Egyptian pounds ($446 million) a year, he said.  The company’s action follows a similar decision by textile
producer Arab Polvara in November after it couldn’t resolve a
pay dispute with workers, highlighting the lack of security two
years after the 2011 uprising. At the Suez Canal entrance of
Port Said, hundreds of protesters gathered for a fourth day
seeking to enforce a work stoppage, cutting roads and preventing
workers from reaching the area.  “We won’t open until the government provides security,
support and protection to businessmen” Amer said “We won’t
come back unless security and stability is restored.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
