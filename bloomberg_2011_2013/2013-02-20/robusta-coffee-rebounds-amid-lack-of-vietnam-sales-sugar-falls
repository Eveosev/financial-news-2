Arabica coffee rebounded in New York
on speculation prices fell too far as investors may buy futures
after bets on lower prices rose to a record. Cocoa slid.  The beans favored by Starbucks Corp. fell as much as 1.9
percent yesterday. Supplies from top producer Brazil, Colombia
and some African nations will be enough to compensate for losses
caused by leaf rust disease in Central America, researcher F.O.
Licht GmbH said in a report dated yesterday. Large and small
speculators, excluding index funds, increased bets on lower
prices to a record as of Feb. 12, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  “Arabica is rebounding because of short covering,” Edward
de Wismes, an agricultural futures broker at Aurel BGC in Paris,
said by e-mail today, referring to investors closing bets on
prices falling further. “Prices should still come under
pressure due to supplies from Brazil.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in May gained 0.8 percent to
$1.395 a pound by 8:36 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Robusta coffee for delivery in May climbed 1 percent to $2,061 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Arabica coffee fell 32 percent in the past 12-months,
making it the worst performing commodity in the Standard &
Poor’s gauge of 24 raw materials. Production in Colombia, the
second-biggest arabica grower, may gain 30 percent to 10 million
bags this year, according to the National Federation of Coffee
Growers. Brazil may harvest 47 million to 50.2 million bags in
2013, which could be a record for a year in which trees enter
the lower-yielding half of the cycle, the government estimates.
A bag of coffee weights 132 pounds.  The price difference between arabica futures for delivery
in March and for May narrowed by 51 percent over the past week,

March contract, when holders of futures must notify
counterparties whether they intend to accept physical delivery.  Raw sugar for delivery in May advanced 0.2 percent to 18.01
