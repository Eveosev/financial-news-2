India has expressed an interest in
making a third purchase of  BAE Systems Plc  Hawk jets, to be used
for aerobatic displays, like Britain’s Red Arrows, according to
officials from U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s office.  The Indian government is interested in acquiring the
advanced jet-trainer aircraft in the next two years to upgrade
the air force’s Surya Kiran exhibition team, the officials told
reporters after the British premier met his counterpart  Manmohan Singh  in New Delhi. Cameron concludes a three-day visit to India
today at the helm of the biggest ever U.K. trade delegation.  India bought 66 Hawks in 2004 and 57 in 2008 to train
pilots. The 2008 sale was worth 500 million pounds ($773
million). The Royal Air Force uses 12 Hawks in its Red Arrows
squadron.  Cameron told Singh that the RAF would help India fit smoke
pods to allow them display the orange, green and white colors of
the nation’s flag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
