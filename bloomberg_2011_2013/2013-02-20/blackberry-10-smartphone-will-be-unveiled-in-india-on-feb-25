BlackBerry , the struggling
smartphone maker, will unveil the new BlackBerry 10 lineup in
India on Feb. 25, following its debut in the U.K., Canada and
the United Arab Emirates.  New BlackBerry phones will be introduced at an event in
Mumbai, the Waterloo, Ontario-based company said in an
invitation sent to media.  The move would bring BlackBerry 10 phones to one of the
company’s most important markets, helping shore up its comeback
plan. Still, investors are more focused on the rollout of the
new models in the U.S., which remains BlackBerry’s biggest
source of revenue. The flagship Z10 model isn’t due in that
country until March.  Apple Inc. ’s iOS and Google Inc.’s Android have robbed
BlackBerry of most of its market share in recent years. Apple
and Android together accounted for 91 percent of global
smartphone sales in the fourth quarter, while BlackBerry dropped
to 3.2 percent, according to IDC.  BlackBerry’s sales in developing markets have held up
better than in North America and Europe, though revenue is down
globally. Sales from Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. fell 53
percent last quarter from a year earlier. Revenue from the rest
of the world, including India, dropped 44 percent.  BlackBerry  fell  4.5 percent to $13.71 at the close today in
New York. The stock has gained 16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
