Palm oil shipments from Malaysia
increased at a slower pace in the first 20 days of February on
fewer purchases by countries in South Asia including India, the
biggest buyer, according to an estimate by surveyor Intertek.  Exports climbed 0.6 percent to 835,612 metric tons from
830,830 tons in the same period in January,  Intertek  said in an
e-mailed statement today. The gain was smaller than an 18
percent advance in both the first 10 days and 15 days of the
month. Shipments to South Asia fell 13 percent to 180,390 tons,
compared with the same period in January, Intertek data show.
Societe Generale de Surveillance will release its estimates for
the period later today.  In January, India imposed a tax of 2.5 percent on crude
palm imports and raised the benchmark price on which the tax is
applicable to $802 a ton from $447 to shield domestic growers
from cheap overseas supplies. Malaysia reduced taxes on crude
export to zero in January and February to clear stockpiles that
reached a record 2.63 million tons in December. Reserves slid
1.9 percent to 2.58 million tons last month and prices in Kuala
Lumpur gained 5.3 percent this year.  “The rise in prices may be deterring buyers from India,
they may want to wait for prices to drop,” said  Arhnue Tan , an
analyst at Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
India’s import tax may also have reduced shipments, she said.  Shipments from Malaysia will be taxed at 4.5 percent in
March as the reference price was set at 2,306.11 ringgit a ton,
above the threshold of 2,250 ringgit that triggers the tax.  Palm oil for delivery in May climbed dropped 0.4 percent to
2,557 ringgit a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange, after
rising earlier by as much as 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
