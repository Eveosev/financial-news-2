Bombardier Inc.  jumped the most in
almost three months after the planemaker said Russia’s Ilyushin
Finance Co. converted a letter of intent into an order for
CSeries jets that could be worth at least $2.56 billion.  Bombardier’s widely traded  Class B stock  advanced 4.4
percent to C$4.28 at the Toronto close for its biggest single-
day gain since Nov. 27. Most of the increase came in the last 20
minutes of trading, after Bombardier disclosed the order.  The deal includes a purchase agreement by Ilyushin to buy
32 units of the CS300 plane and options for another 10,
Montreal-based Bombardier said today in a statement. It follows
a letter of intent signed by Ilyushin in August 2011.  Bombardier continues to develop the CSeries, its largest
jet ever, after saying in November that it would push back the
maiden flight by six months because of unspecified issues with
suppliers. The company now plans to conduct a first flight by
June 30.  Based on list prices, Ilyushin’s firm order would be valued
at about $2.56 billion, Bombardier said. That would increase to
about $3.42 billion if Ilyushin exercises its 10 options.  United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt & Whitney unit said today
Transport Canada certified the PW1500G engine that will power
the CSeries. Bombardier is in the process of completing final
assembly of the first CSeries flight test aircraft, Rob Dewar,
vice president and general manager of the program, said in a
statement.  Bombardier is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results
tomorrow before the market opens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
