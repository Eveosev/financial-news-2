A New York City firefighter who
pulled a victim to safety through a burning building even as
temperatures reached in excess of 1,000 degrees is among the 18
people who will be awarded the nation’s highest award for valor
for public safety officers.  Vice President  Joe Biden  and Attorney General  Eric Holder 
today in Washington will present Peter Demontreux, a New York
city firefighter, and 17 other emergency services officers, law
enforcement officers and firefighters with the Medal of Valor.
The award is presented to public safety officers who have
“exhibited exceptional courage, regardless of personal safety,
in the attempt to save or protect human life,” according to the
Justice Department’s website.  Four individuals killed in the line of duty are among the
recipients of the award, which, including today’s honorees, has
been given 78 times since its creation in 2001.  Demontreux, in what the White House citation called “one
of the most remarkable rescues ever witnessed,” pulled an
individual through the burning third-floor of a brownstone,
continuing the rescue even as the floor burst into flames and he
caught on fire.  “Firefighter Demontreux, now on fire, made the split
second decision that he would not leave victim behind,” the
White House said. “After reaching the window, Firefighter
Demontreux insured the victim was safely on the aerial ladder
before diving out himself.”  Demontreux was previously  honored  with the James Gordon
Bennett Medal, the highest honor in New York city for a member
of the fire service, for his efforts during the August 2010
rescue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
