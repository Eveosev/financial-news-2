Quebec’s anti-corruption police  unit 
said it completed a raid at Montreal City Hall that local media
say is part of an investigation into allegations of illegal
political financing.  About 125 investigators descended upon Montreal City Hall
and six borough offices at about 4 p.m. yesterday, Anne-
Frederick Laurence, a spokeswoman for the unit, said in a
telephone interview. The raid lasted until early today, Laurence
said, declining to say what the investigators are focusing on.
Radio-Canada  reported  that the agency is probing illegal
financing.  Montreal Mayor  Michael Applebaum  told RDI television today
he met with investigators and isn’t a target of the raids.
Applebaum said he answered all questions and that his
administration is cooperating with police.  The raid comes as a government-appointed commission, whose
hearings are televised daily in Quebec, continues to look into
the granting and management of public construction contracts.
Hearings began in May.  Applebaum became interim mayor three months ago after his
predecessor,  Gerald Tremblay ,  quit  amid reports that his party
received illegal contributions. Tremblay denied the allegations,
which emerged during testimony at the public contracts
commission.  Montreal’s next municipal elections are scheduled to take
place in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
