Day-ahead power in Poland increased
to its highest price in more than three weeks, advancing with
German prices amid forecasts for weaker wind output.  Electricity  for next-day delivery in Poland increased 4.8
percent to 173.86 zloty ($55.96) a megawatt-hour, broker data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest since Jan. 25.  Day-ahead power in Germany rose 16 percent to 51 euros
($68.26) a megawatt-hour. Output from wind turbines in the
country may fall to 4,000 megawatts tomorrow, according to the
website of Meteologica SA, the Madrid-based weather forecaster.
That’s below the annual average of 4,856 megawatts and today’s
level of 5,292 megawatts at 1:45 p.m. in Berlin, according to
data from European Energy Exchange AG in Leipzig, Germany.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia increased 1.8 percent to 50.14 euros a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators.  Hungarian day-ahead power  settled 1.7 percent
higher at 50.21 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
