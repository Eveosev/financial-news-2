Nordic electricity for next quarter
rose as weather forecasts indicated an increased need for
electric heating and after carbon climbed.  The benchmark Nordic contract gained 1.1 percent to 36.20
euros ($48.49) a megawatt-hour as of 11:57 a.m. on Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.â€™s energy exchange in Oslo. The March contract
advanced as much as 1.1 percent to 37.80 euros and later traded
at 37.75 euros.  Temperatures in Norway will average minus 1.7 degrees
Celsius (29 Fahrenheit) through March 2, down from an earlier
forecast of minus 1.4 degrees, MetraWeather data using the ECMWF
model show. Lower temperatures boost the demand for electric
heating.  EU carbon permits for December rose as much as 5.1 percent
to 4.92 euros a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London. Emission prices can influence generation costs at coal-
and gas-fed plants. German power for baseload delivery next
quarter climbed as much as 0.4 percent to 37.30 euros a
megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Nordic region gets more than half of its power from
hydroelectric plants. The amount of water and snow available to
generate electricity in the region may be 16.4 terawatt-hours
below normal for the time of year in two weeks, down from 14.6
terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
