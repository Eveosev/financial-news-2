U.K. stocks  advanced, extending a
five-year high, after jobless claims in the country fell more
than estimated in January and Bank of England minutes showed
more members voted for increasing stimulus measures.  Rexam Plc jumped 5.3 percent after full-year profit beat
analyst expectations. BHP Billiton retreated 2.4 percent after
saying first-half profit declined 58 percent and Marius Kloppers
will step down as chief executive officer. RSA Insurance Group
Plc tumbled the most in almost nine years as it cut its final
dividend for 2012.  The  FTSE 100 Index  rose 0.3 percent to 6,395.37 at the
close in London. The benchmark gauge has rallied 8.4 percent so
far this year as U.S. lawmakers reached a budget compromise. The
measure is also heading for its ninth monthly increase, its
longest winning streak since 1997. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index also added 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
retreated 0.2 percent.  “There’s the implication that more quantitative easing
might be needed to kickstart the U.K. economy,”  Richard Hunter ,
head of U.K. equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in London, said
in a phone interview. “Clearly austerity and even the QE we’ve
had in the U.K. haven’t gained traction yet.”  Bank of England Governor Mervyn King pushed for more
stimulus this month as officials considered an  interest-rate  cut
and expanding the range of assets purchased as possible ways to
help bolster the economy, according to the minutes of the
central bank’s Feb. 6-7 Monetary Policy Committee meeting.  Stimulus Target  King, Paul Fisher and David Miles wanted to increase the
target for bond purchases by 25 billion pounds ($38.2 billion)
to 400 billion pounds on Feb. 7, though were outvoted by the
remaining six members of the Monetary Policy. Miles had been
alone in calling for more stimulus the previous month. The MPC
kept both its benchmark interest rate and its target for bond
purchases unchanged at the meeting.  Mark Carney will leave his job as Bank of Canada Governor
to replace King at the BOE on June 1.  “Whether there’s any shift away from concentrating on
inflation, and towards revitalizing growth; that will be the
main yardstick Mark Carney will be measured against,” Hunter
said.  U.K.  jobless claims  declined by 12,500 in January, the
Office for National Statistics said in a report today. The
median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop of 5,500.  U.S. Housing  In the U.S., Britain’s biggest trading partner,  housing
starts  dropped more than projected last month, a Commerce
Department report showed. Housing starts fell at an annual pace
of 8.5 percent in January, after a revised 15.7 percent gain the
previous month. That compares with the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey for a 3.6 percent decrease.  Rexam  advanced 25.3 pence to 502 pence, its biggest advance
in a year. Profit before tax was 418 million pounds in 2012
($645 million), exceeding the 377 million-pound median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey.  Spectris Plc  gained 0.6 percent to 2,440 pence, its highest
price since at least May 1989. The U.K.’s biggest maker of
production-testing gear said comparable sales grew 3 percent in
2012 and Chief Executive Officer  John O’Higgins  is confident for
2013, according to a statement.  BHP, RSA  BHP Billiton  retreated 52.5 pence to 2,183.5 pence. Net
income was $4.2 billion, including $1.4 billion in one-time
charges, in the six months ended Dec. 31, from $9.9 billion a
year ago, BHP said in a statement. This missed the $5.6 billion
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The world’s biggest mining company also named copper unit
head Andrew Mackenzie as chief executive officer to succeed
Marius Kloppers on May 10.  RSA Insurance Group  dropped 14 percent to 117 pence, its
biggest slide since March 2004. The U.K.’s largest non-life
insurer reduced its 2012 second-half payout to 3.9 pence a share
from 5.82 pence a share the previous year and forecast a similar
cut in 2013.  The number of shares changing hands on FTSE 100-listed
companies was 31 percent greater than the average of the past
three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
