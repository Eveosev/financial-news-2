India’s rupee strengthened for a
second day before the capital markets regulator auctions debt-
purchase permits to foreign investors, even as a nationwide
strike lowers trade volumes.  The Securities & Exchange Board of India will sell 666.7
billion rupees ($12.3 billion) of the quotas today, according to
a notice on its website. Overseas funds’  investments  in local-
currency debt rose to a record $33.7 billion this month,
exchange data show, as the nation’s 10-year notes offer a  yield
premium  of 577 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.  “The outlook for the rupee is improving,” analysts at
Credit Agricole CIB, including Hong Kong-based Mitul Kotecha,
wrote in a research report today. “One supportive factor for
the rupee is the strength of portfolio capital flows into the
country.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent from Feb. 18 to 54.1050 per
dollar as of 9:43 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The market was shut yesterday for a local holiday.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 9.28 percent.  Eleven trade unions across India’s political spectrum are
on a two-day strike starting today, to protest against issues
including rising prices and the government’s sale of state
assets. The absence of some banking staff will keep currency
trading levels low, according to traders including Sudarshan
Bhatt, chief dealer at state-run Corporation Bank in Mumbai.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.15 per
dollar, compared with 55.32 on Feb. 18, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.01 versus 55.24 yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy
or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
