Brazilian exports of sugar-cane
ethanol to the U.S. may rise as much as 29 percent this crop
season as oil companies there are mandated to blend more
renewable fuels.  Brazil may export as much as 4.5 billion liters (1.19
billion gallons) to the U.S. next harvest season, which begins
in April, Julio Maria Borges, director of Sao Paulo-based
consulting firm Job Economia e Planajemento Ltda., said today in
a telephone interview.  Oil companies in the U.S. are required by the government to
mix 2.75 billion gallons of advanced biofuel into their
transport fuels this year, said Borges. Advanced biofuel is any
renewable fuel that achieves at least 50 percent more
greenhouse-gas savings than fossil fuels. Cane-based ethanol and
biodiesel from soybeans qualify as advanced biofuels.  “Ethanol is the cheaper option and that looks set to
remain the case going forward,” he said.  The quota for advanced biofuel is expected to expand to 21
billion gallons in 2022, creating more export opportunities for
Brazilian mills, Borges said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
