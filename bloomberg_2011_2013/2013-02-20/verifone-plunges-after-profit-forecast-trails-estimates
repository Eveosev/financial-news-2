VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  plunged the
most in more than four years after the maker of credit-card
terminals forecast second-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates, amid weak economic conditions in Europe.  The shares tumbled 43 percent to $18.24 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest intraday decline since November 2008.
Earnings excluding some items will be 45 cents to 50 cents a
share in the quarter ending in April, San Jose, California-based
VeriFone said in a statement yesterday. Analysts on average had
 predicted  profit of 80 cents a share, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  VeriFone makes credit and debit card-accepting terminals
that are used in retail stores, gas stations and taxicabs.
Verifone is used in about half of New York’s taxicabs, and
serves an estimated 35,000 taxis in the U.S. Beyond Europe,
VeriFone said it experienced lower-than-anticipated sales from
customers in  Brazil , and that it had an increase in deferred
revenue from clients in  Africa  and the  Middle East .  “The preannouncement is very bad; they are missing their
targets by a very wide margin,”  Gil Luria , an analyst at
Wedbush Securities Inc., said in a telephone interview. Luria
has a neutral rating for VeriFone.“The macroeconomic conditions
are certainly not enough to explain such a dramatic shortfall.”  VeriFone also announced preliminary first-quarter adjusted
profit of 47 cents to 50 cents a share, less than the company’s
prior  projection  of as much as 73 cents.  Recent acquisitions probably didn’t boost VeriFone’s growth
as much as projected, and may have to be restructured, Luria
said.  Last year, Verifone  bought  LIFT Retail Marketing Technology
Inc., a provider of convenience-store digital-marketing systems,
and Swedish payment-services provider Point, as well as other
companies.  Victoria Brown, a spokeswoman for VeriFone, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
