     Feb. 20 (Bloomberg) --Brazil’s economic expansion slowed by
more than half in December from the previous month, as the
world’s second-largest emerging market continues to respond
slowly to government efforts to spur growth.  The seasonally adjusted  economic activity index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, rose 0.26 percent in December after
increasing a revised 0.57 percent in November, the central bank
said today in a report posted on its website. Analysts expected
a 0.3 percent increase, according to the median estimate from 15
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The non-seasonally adjusted index rose 1.19 percent from a
year ago, compared with a median estimate of 1.4 percent from 17
economists surveyed.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration has worked to
reverse two years of declining growth while slowing the highest
inflation in a year. Officials have cut taxes for industry and
consumers, maintained the benchmark interest rate at a record
low of 7.25 percent and allowed the real to strengthen the most
among major currencies against the dollar this year in order to
lower prices of imports.  The world’s sixth-largest economy grew 1 percent last year,
the central bank estimates. That’s down from 2.7 percent in 2011
and 7.5 percent in 2010.  Flagging growth hasn’t stopped consumer prices from rising.
In January they jumped the most in almost eight years, as annual
inflation  reached  6.15 percent. The central bank targets
inflation of 4.5 percent plus or minus two percentage points.  Analysts covering Brazil have increased 2013 inflation
forecasts while cutting growth predictions for six of the last
seven weeks, according to the latest central bank survey.
Economists forecast inflation of 5.70 percent this year and
growth of 3.08 percent, compared with 5.47 percent and 3.30
percent at the end of December, respectively.  Brazil’s retail sales unexpectedly dropped 0.5 percent in
December, the national statistics agency said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
