Trinity Coal Corp. creditors with
about $104.3 million in claims filed an involuntary Chapter 11
bankruptcy petition for the Essar Group unit.  Units of  Credit Agricole SA , ING Groep NV and Natixis filed
the petition today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Lexington,
Kentucky. The creditors also filed an involuntary petition
against Trinity affiliate, Frasure Creek Mining LLC.  Essar Group, the Indian business group controlled by
billionaire brothers  Shashikant  and  Ravikant Ruia , acquired
Trinity Coal in 2010 for $600 million.  “Trinity’s current management has failed to negotiate with
Trinity’s creditors,” Credit Agricole said in court papers
seeking the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee.  Essar Group officials didn’t immediately respond to an
after-hours request seeking comment on the involuntary filing.  The case is In re Trinity Coal Corp., 13-50364, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Kentucky (Lexington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
