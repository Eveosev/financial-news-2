Deutsche Bank AG ’s RREEF real estate
investment unit said it’s in exclusive talks to sell its 70
percent stake in French department store operator  Printemps  to
co-owner Borletti Group and Qatari investors.  The parties started the negotiations today, RREEF and
Borletti, which owns 30 percent of Printemps, said in a
statement. No further details were provided.  Italian investor  Maurizio Borletti , the group’s owner,
doesn’t want to sell his holding, a spokeswoman told Bloomberg
in December.  The latest negotiations could end rival Groupe  Galeries
Lafayette ’s chances of buying Printemps.  “Galeries Lafayette never hid its interest in Printemps,”
the company said in an e-mailed statement. “The group will keep
a close eye on how the deal unfolds.”  Dalian Wanda Group Corp. is also interested in Printemps,
Senior Vice President Hu Zhanghong  told  French newspaper Les
Echos in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
