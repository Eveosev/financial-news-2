Sheikh Hussein al-Ahmar, a prominent
Yemeni tribal chief and member of parliament, resigned from the
country’s ruling party and announced his support for anti-
government protesters, an opposition party website reported.  Other chiefs from Yemen’s two biggest tribes, the Hashid
and Bakeel, announced a rally for tens of thousands in Amran
province today to show support for demonstrations calling for an
end to President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s three-decade rule, al-
sahwah news website of the Islah opposition party reported. Both
Saleh and al-Ahmar are members of the Hashid.  Those who have resigned “have their own agenda which are
different from that of the party,” Abdulhafidgh al-Nahari, vice
chairman of the media department at the ruling General People’s
Congress, said by phone today. The party is battling to defend
“the republic, unity and democracy and this is an honorable
battle we are fighting for,” he said.  Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in
Yemen’s capital Sana’a yesterday chanting “leave” and “the
people want to overthrow the regime.”  Police have used tear gas and truncheons in an attempt to
halt previous protests and have on occasion fired guns, leaving
at least seven people dead. The demonstrations, which have taken
place in towns and cities across the country, including Taiz and
Aden, have lasted more than two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
