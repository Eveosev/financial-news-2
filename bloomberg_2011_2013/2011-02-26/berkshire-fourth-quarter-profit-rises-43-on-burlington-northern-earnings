  Berkshire Hathaway Inc .’s quarterly
profit rose 43 percent to the highest since 2007 on derivative
gains and earnings from the railroad that billionaire Chairman  Warren Buffett  bought last year.  Fourth-quarter net income advanced to $4.38 billion, or
$2,656 a share, from $3.06 billion, or $1,969, a year earlier,
Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today on its website.  Buffett acquired Burlington Northern Santa Fe for $26.5
billion to add the second-biggest U.S. railroad to Berkshire’s
collection of insurance, energy and consumer-goods units. The
80-year-old chief executive officer issued stock and debt to
fund the deal for  Fort Worth , Texas-based Burlington. Economic
expansion in the U.S. fueled profit gains at the freight-hauling
unit in 2010.  “The highlight of 2010 was our acquisition of Burlington
Northern  Santa Fe , a purchase that’s working out even better
than I expected,” Buffett said in his letter to shareholders
today. He said he’s looking for more “major acquisitions.”  Book value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, rose in
the last three months of 2010 to $157.3 billion from $149.7
billion on Sept. 30 as earnings and stock advances boosted
capital. The railroad contributed $1.03 billion in net earnings
in the fourth quarter. Burlington had net income of $536 million
in the fourth quarter of 2009 as an independent company.  Derivative Bets  “Kudos for that purchase, I was pretty skeptical at the
beginning,” said  Meyer Shields , an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus
& Co. in an interview before the earnings were announced. “It
was a good deal for him.”  The gain from equity index puts, in which Buffett bets on
stock indexes, tripled to $2.49 billion as global markets
advanced. Berkshire Class A shares advanced 5.9 percent on the
New York Stock Exchange this year, beating the 4.9 percent gain
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  The profit increase halts Berkshire’s streak of consecutive
quarterly earnings declines at two. Net income fell in the
second and third quarters of 2010 as derivative bets soured.
Buffett, Berkshire’s biggest shareholder, uses the contracts to
speculate on the direction of equity markets and the solvency of
corporate and municipal borrowers.  Full-year net income rose 61 percent to $13 billion.  Railroad Results  Railroad earnings surged last year as the economic pickup
increased demand for shipments of cars, coal and construction
products.  Union Pacific Corp ., the largest U.S. railroad by 2009
revenue, posted a 41 percent fourth-quarter profit gain.  Norfolk
Southern Corp ., the No. 4 railroad, hired 1,900 workers last
year and will hire 1,500 more this year after business “outran
our expectations,” CEO Charles Moorman said at a Feb. 15
conference.  Buffett is seeking acquisitions as earnings and maturing
investments boost Berkshire’s cash holdings. At the end of
December, the company had $38.2 billion of cash, its highest
total in three years. Buffett has said he’ll consider purchases
outside the U.S. He visited  China  in September and planned trips
to Japan and  India  for this year.  “We will need both good performance from our current
businesses and more major acquisitions,” Buffett wrote. “We’re
prepared. Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger
finger is itchy.”  The cash hoard will grow with the termination of financing
deals that Buffett struck during the credit crunch. Swiss
Reinsurance Co. repaid about $3 billion in a deal that gave
Berkshire annual interest of 12 percent.  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc . and  General Electric Co . are weighing the return of $8
billion that Buffett agreed to inject in 2008 for securities
paying 10 percent.  Wells Fargo, Coca-Cola  The stock portfolio was valued at $61.5 billion at the end
of the fourth quarter, up from $57.6 billion on Sept. 30, on
gains in  Coca-Cola Co . and  Wells Fargo & Co . Buffett spent $372
million on equities and $2.78 billion on fixed-maturity
securities in the quarter.  He sold about $1.35 billion of stocks and $1.79 billion of
fixed-income holdings. Berkshire said in a filing this month
that the company sold its stake in Bank of America Corp., ending
an investment that spanned three and a half years in which the
lender’s stock lost more than two-thirds of its value.  Insurance underwriting profit climbed to $414 million in
the quarter from $335 million a year earlier. The pretax gain at
Geico was $200 million, compared with a profit of $190 million
in the last three months of 2009. Some fourth-quarter results
were calculated by subtracting figures for the first nine months
from the full-year data provided today.  Tank Cars, Trucking  Earnings at Marmon rose to $192 million from $160 million.
The business has operations including the manufacture of
railroad tank cars and wire and cable products. Berkshire
purchased a majority stake in the company from the Pritzker
family in 2008 and plans to pay about $1.5 billion this quarter
for another 16.6 percent of the company.  Earnings at McLane increased to $91 million from $71
million. McLane delivers food and alcoholic beverages by truck
to clients including Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and convenience shops.
Profit at Berkshire’s furniture stores, jewelry shops and the
candy business climbed to $122 million from $113 million.  NetJets, the luxury flight provider, posted pretax earnings
of $49 million compared with a loss of $180 million a year
earlier.   David Sokol , chairman of Berkshire’s energy business,
fired pilots and wrote down the value of aircraft after Buffett
installed him as NetJets CEO in 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
