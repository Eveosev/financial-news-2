A Brazilian judge ordered a halt to
construction of the $11 billion Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in
the country’s rainforest and prohibited the state development
bank from financing the project, a federal court said yesterday.  Construction should be frozen until all the environmental
criteria are met, according to a statement on the website of
 Justicia Federal  for the state of Para. Twenty-nine conditions
weren’t met and four others were only partially completed, the
statement said.  Belo Monte, criticized by “Avatar” director  James Cameron 
last year because of its potential environmental damage, will
flood 516 square kilometers (199 square miles) of rainforest and
require relocation of about 1,000 Indians. The dam, set to be
the world’s third biggest, is part of the government’s plan to
boost energy supplies as Latin America’s biggest economy grows
at the fastest pace in two decades.  A group led by state-owned Cia. Hidro Electrica do  Sao
Francisco , a unit of state-run Centrais Electricas Brasileiras
SA, known as Eletrobras, won the rights to build and operate the
dam last year.  Calls to Eletrobras’s press department outside of regular
business hours weren’t returned.  Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social, the
state development bank, approved in December a 1.09 billion-real
loan to Norte Energia SA, the holding company for the project.  The G1 website reported the court’s decision earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
