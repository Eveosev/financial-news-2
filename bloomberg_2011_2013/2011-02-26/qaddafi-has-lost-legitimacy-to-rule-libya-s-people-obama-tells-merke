President Barack Obama told German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  that “when a leader’s only means of
staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people,
he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right
for his country by leaving now.”  Obama spoke with Merkel about Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
and unrest in Libya during a telephone call today. The two
leaders “reaffirmed their support for the Libyan people’s
demand for universal rights” and a responsive government,
according to a statement e-mailed from the White House.  To contact the reporter on this story:
