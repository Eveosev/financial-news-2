The owner of a Qing dynasty vase
sold for 43 million pounds ($69 million) in a record-breaking
auction last year may not yet have received payment, the
Financial Times reported.  Peter Bainbridge of auction house Bainbridgeâ€™s of Ruislip
said he was unable to confirm his client had been paid and that
he had been instructed not to talk about the sale, according to
the newspaper.  The vase, found in a bungalow in Pinner, northwest  London ,
was sold to a Chinese buyer on Nov. 11, beating the prior record
for the auction of Chinese porcelain of 18.2 million pounds, the
Financial Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
