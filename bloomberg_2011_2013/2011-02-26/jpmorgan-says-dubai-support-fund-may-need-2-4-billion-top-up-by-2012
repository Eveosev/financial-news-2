Dubai’s financial support fund, set
up to help the emirate’s state-owned companies pay back debt,
may need as much as $2.4 billion extra by 2012 to pay off
maturing liabilities, according to JPMorgan Chase.  “We estimate that DFSF’s cash will get exhausted later
this year or early next, and will have to be ‘topped up’ by $1.3
to $2.4 billion over the next two years,” Zafar Nazim, a
London-based analyst at JPMorgan Securities Ltd, said in a
report to clients yesterday. “We would expect capital markets
to be the primary source of such fund-raising, although some
asset sales cannot be ruled out.”  Dubai roiled international markets in 2009 when it
announced plans to delay $24.9 billion in debt of its state-
owned holding company Dubai World. The holding company, which
has interests from real estate to industry, reached an agreement
with more than 70 creditor banks to delay loan payments after
property prices slumped in the emirate and frozen credit markets
prevented it from raising new loans to repay older ones.  Dubai World plans to return $4.4 billion of its loans in
five years and $10 billion in eight years, and pay below-market  interest rates  over their lifespan as part of its restructuring
plan. The money will be raised by selling assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
