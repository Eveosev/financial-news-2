Auto Windscreens Ltd. has closed,
making 1,042 staff redundant, the Times reported, citing
Deloitte & Touche LLP partner and joint liquidator Chris
Farrington.  The company received 90 approaches by interested parties
but no offer for the entire company as a going concern, the
newspaper said.  Auto Windscreens was sold to  Arques Industries AG , now
known as Gigaset AG, by U.K. insurer Aviva Plc two years ago,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
