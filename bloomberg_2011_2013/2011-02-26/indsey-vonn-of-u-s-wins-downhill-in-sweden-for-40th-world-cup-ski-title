  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. won today’s
downhill race in Are,  Sweden , for her 40th career World Cup ski
title.  Vonn finished with a time of 1 minute, 40.93 seconds to
take her seventh title of the season. She’s within one of the
record of 41 World Cup victories held by Sweden’s Anja Paerson
heading to tomorrow’s super-G race.  Tina Maze of Slovenia was second, 0.13 seconds behind Vonn,
with  Germany ’s Maria Riesch 0.21 seconds back in third. It was
the 26-year-old Vonn’s first victory since suffering a
concussion in a training run three weeks ago.  The win keeps Vonn atop downhill season standings with 520
points, 103 more than second-place Riesch. She also moves within
176 points of Riesch in the  World Cup  overall standings as she
seeks her fourth consecutive title.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
