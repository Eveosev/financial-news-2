German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said a Greek exit from the euro “is not taboo, but I
think it’s wrong,” according to a  Focus magazine  interview.    Greece ’s return to the drachma would be “catastrophic”
for the German economy because it would trigger an appreciation
of the euro, damping German exports, Schaeuble told the
magazine.  Allowing countries to exit the euro temporarily would mean
“the beginning of the end” of the single currency, Schaeuble
told Focus. German funds directed toward aiding indebted
countries are an investment in the euro, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
