  Brazil ´s federal court on Friday
ordered construction suspended at the Belo Monte hydroelectric
dam in the country’s rainforest and also prohibited Banco
Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES), the
state development bank, from transferring money to Norte Energia
SA to finance the project, the G1 website  reported , citing
prosecutors.  The judge ruled the project’s environmental safeguards
don't meet the criteria demanded by law, according to G1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
