Three production lines at  Iraq ’s
biggest oil refinery in the northern city of Baiji were
destroyed and four engineers were killed in an attack by
militants, Iraqi state television reported.  The militants blew up kerosene and benzene production units
at the refinery, Reuters news agency cited the governor of
Salahuddin province as saying. The refinery produces 11 million
liters of gasoline, 7 million liters of benzene and 4.5 million
liters of kerosene daily, it said.  Crude oil capped its biggest weekly gain in two years
yesterday on concern about interruptions to Middle East supplies
following unrest in  Libya . Protests ignited by the ouster of
Tunisia’s president last month and fanned by the Feb. 11 fall of
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  have also spread to Yemen and
Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
