U.S. stocks fell, driving the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest weekly drop in
three months, as Libya’s anti-government uprising pushed oil
prices higher and prompted concern economic growth may falter.  Equities pared their weekly decline on Feb. 25 as
confidence among American consumers climbed to the highest level
in three years.  Hewlett-Packard Co . and  Wal-Mart Stores Inc .
lost more than 6.6 percent in the week after their results
missed forecasts.  General Electric Co . fell 2.9 percent as
industry groups that are more dependent on economic growth led
the declines in the S&P 500. Higher oil prices boosted energy
shares, which had the only gain among 10  S&P 500  groups.  The S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent to 1,319.88 this past week,
the first drop after three straight weeks of gains. The index
retreated 2.1 percent on Feb. 22, its biggest one-day drop since
Aug. 11. The weekly decline was the largest since a 2.2 percent
drop in the five days ended Nov. 12. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  dropped 260.80 points, or 2.1 percent, to 12,130.45.  “The events in  Libya  were the key driver,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Columbia Management in  Boston ,
which oversees $327 billion. “Investors are afraid that a
tightening of oil supplies will lead to extraordinarily higher
prices, which will divert spending from other parts of the
economy and maybe even force a rethinking of forecasts for
global growth going forward.”  Highest Since 2008  The S&P 500 fell after climbing to the highest level since
June 2008 on Feb. 18. The decline lowered the gauge’s 2011
advance to 5 percent after a 13 percent rally in 2010, as
government stimulus measures and improving profits bolstered
investor confidence.  Stocks slipped as Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi tried to
tighten his grip on Tripoli, sending crude oil to its biggest
weekly gain in two years on concern the turmoil that has cut
Libya’s output may spread to other parts of the Middle East.  Futures in New York surged to a 29-month high on Feb. 24
amid estimates that Libya’s output was cut by as much as two-
thirds. Oil retreated below $100 after  Saudi Arabia , the U.S.
and the  International Energy Agency  said they can compensate for
any Libyan supply disruption and as the  U.S. economy  grew less
than forecast in the fourth quarter. Crude oil for April
delivery settled at $97.88 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange Feb. 25.  Oil    Oil prices  may surge to $220 a barrel if political unrest
in North Africa halts exports from Libya and Algeria, Nomura
Holdings Inc. said. Libya, the holder of Africa’s largest oil
reserves, is the latest country in the region to be convulsed by
protests ignited by the ouster of Tunisia’s president last month
and energized by the departure of Egypt’s President Hosni Mubarak on Feb. 11.  Analysts at Morgan Stanley say sharp increases in oil
prices pose the biggest threat to growth because consumers
suffer a sudden hit to purchasing power. They said an 85 percent
to 90 percent increase in the price of oil over a year was
followed by U.S. recessions in 1975, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2008.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or
VIX, jumped 17 percent for the biggest advance since the week
that ended Jan. 21. It posted the biggest one-day jump in nine
months on Feb. 22 as investors bid up the price of options
insurance against losses in the S&P 500 amid escalating violence
in Libya. The VIX has averaged 17.35 this year.  GE, Transportation  Gauges of industrial companies, materials producers,
corporations reliant on discretionary spending by consumers and
financial stocks slumped the most among 10 groups in the S&P
500, declining at least 2.3 percent.  GE retreated 2.9 percent to $20.82. U.S. Steel Corp., the
country’s largest producer of the metal by volume, decreased 8.2
percent to $56.76, while  Sears Holdings Corp ., the largest U.S.
department store chain, lost 11 percent to $83.10.  A gauge of transportation companies in the S&P 500 fell 4.3
percent, the most within 24 industries in the benchmark index
for U.S. equities. The Dow Jones Transportation Average tumbled
4.5 percent, the most since August, to 5,060.37.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
consumer sentiment for February climbed to 77.5 from 74.2 the
prior month, a report yesterday showed. Economists projected the
gauge would rise to 75.5, according to the median of 59
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Economic Growth  The U.S. economy grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter, slower than previously calculated and less than
forecast as state and local governments made deeper cuts in
spending. The revised increase in gross domestic product
compares with a 3.2 percent estimate issued last month and a 2.6
percent gain in the third quarter. The economy, excluding
inventories, grew at a 6.7 percent pace, the most since 1998,
figures from the Commerce Department showed yesterday.  “There’s still more recovery to come,” said Joseph Milano, manager of the T. Rowe Price New America Growth Fund,
which oversees about $1.5 billion. “We’re still in the
beginning of the rebound, and it’s another reason not to be
bearish at this point.”  Fourth-quarter profit exceeded the average analyst
estimates at 71 percent of the 456 companies in the S&P 500 that
have reported results since Jan. 10, Bloomberg data show. H.J.
Heinz Co., the world’s biggest ketchup maker, advanced 4.8
percent this week after projecting its third-quarter profit
would beat analysts’ forecasts.  Corporate Earnings  “Earnings continue to come in above expectations,” said
Craig Hodges, a  fund manager  at Dallas-based Hodges Capital
Management Inc., which oversees about $750 million. “There are
a few hiccups and downtrodden reports because of company
specific issues, but overall there’s been more good than bad.”  Hewlett-Packard fell the most in the Dow average, plunging
12 percent to $42.68, its biggest weekly loss since August. The
world’s largest maker of personal computers missed analysts’
second-quarter sales and profit estimates, marring Leo Apotheker’s first quarter as chief executive officer. Excluding
some costs, second-quarter profit will be as much as $1.21 a
share, missing the $1.26 predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Sales will top out at $31.6 billion, compared with an
average estimate of $32.6 billion.  Wal-Mart posted the second-largest drop in the Dow, losing
6.6 percent to $51.75. The largest retailer fell the most in 13
months after posting a seventh straight sales decline at its
U.S. stores, short of its own projections for the holiday
period. Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said he was
“disappointed” after sales at U.S. stores open at least a year
fell 1.8 percent in the quarter ended Jan. 28. He had said in
October that U.S. comparable sales would be “positive.”  Only Gain  Energy shares had the only gain in the S&P 500 among 10
industries, rising 1.1 percent as a group.    Chevron Corp ., the second-largest U.S. oil company, rose
the most in the Dow, climbing 3.4 percent to $102.10.  Exxon
Mobil Corp ., the largest U.S. oil company, rose the third-most
in the benchmark gauge, increasing 1 percent to $85.34.    Chesapeake Energy Corp . advanced the most in the S&P 500,
rallying 16 percent to $35.37. The most-active U.S. natural-gas
driller sold its Arkansas shale gas assets for $4.75 billion in
cash to  BHP Billiton Ltd . and posted a fourth-quarter profit,
excluding unusual gains and losses, of 70 cents a share, beating
the average of analyst estimates by 9.4 percent, according to
Bloomberg data.    Consumer spending  in the U.S. probably climbed in January,
boosted by rising prices for everything from food to fuel,
economists said before a report next week. Other figures may
show manufacturing continued to expand while home sales dropped.  Companies scheduled to report results next week include  Staples Inc ., H.J. Heinz and Domino’s Pizza Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
