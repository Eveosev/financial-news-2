  Aeroports de Paris , operator of the
French capital’s Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, would be
interested in buying Lyon’s regional airport should the
government sell its stake, Chief Executive Officer Pierre Graff
said in an interview on LCI television.  “The Lyon airport appears to us the best target because
there are clear synergies for us,” Graff said today. The
“initiative” is for the state to decide whether it wants to
cut its stake, he said in the interview.  ADP is investing in its airports’ commercial areas and
traveler comforts as increased revenue from shoppers offsets a
“stagnation” in aviation-related revenue from passenger
traffic and a freeze on fees charged to carriers, Graff said.
Retail and services sales rose 15 percent in 2010, compared with
a 0.4 percent rise in passenger traffic, he said.  The impact of rising oil prices and unrest in the Arab
world is “difficult” to anticipate, the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
