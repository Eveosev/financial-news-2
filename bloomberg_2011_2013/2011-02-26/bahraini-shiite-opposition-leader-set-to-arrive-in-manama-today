A Bahraini Shiite opposition leader
will arrive in Manama, the country’s capital, this afternoon, as
demonstrations for political change continue in the Persian Gulf
island nation.  Hassan Mushaima will land at 3 p.m. after departing from
Beirut on a Gulf Air flight, Gamel al-Sayed, a friend who will
meet him at the airport, said in a phone interview.  Bahrain 
Youth Society for Human Rights also said in an e-mailed
statement that he arrives later this afternoon. “He has already
left from Beirut,” al-Sayed said.  Mushaima, a leader of the Shiite Haq movement, is returning
after leaving from  London  amid protests by the Shiite Muslim
majority demanding democracy, free elections and more job
opportunities. Seven people have been killed in the
demonstrations, which began on Feb. 14, and calmed down almost a
week later after the government pulled back tanks and armored
personnel carriers from the city center and offered to hold
talks with the mostly Shiite opposition.  Mushaima had intended to arrive on Feb. 22 and was delayed
in  Beirut  by authorities because of an international arrest
warrant. Bahrain has pardoned him and dropped charges over an
alleged coup plot against the government,  Reuters  reported,
citing Bahrain’s Foreign Minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa.  Opposition groups have been meeting to draw up demands and
discuss the call for dialog. Shiites make up between 60 and 70
percent of the Bahraini population. The ruling elite is largely
Sunni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
