One of Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi ’s personal nurses is planning to leave Tripoli and
return to her hometown in Ukraine, Kiev-based newspaper  Segodyna 
reported, citing the woman’s daughter.  Galina Kolotnitskaya left home nine years ago to work in  Libya , first at a hospital and then as part of Qaddafi’s
personal staff, the newspaper reported.  “Mom got in touch with me yesterday,” Tatyana
Kolotnitskaya, her daughter, was cited as saying. “She said
she’s in Tripoli now. There’s shooting, fighting, basically
everything they’re showing on the news. She was speaking in a
calm voice and asked me not to worry, and said that soon she’ll
be home.”  Tatyana Kolotnitskaya said she didn’t know whether her
mother was still with Qaddafi, whose rule over the North African
country is in doubt as units of his army defect to join
protests.  Qaddafi “has other Ukrainian nurses. My mom is one of
them. For some reason, he doesn’t trust Libyan women,”
Kolotnitskaya was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
