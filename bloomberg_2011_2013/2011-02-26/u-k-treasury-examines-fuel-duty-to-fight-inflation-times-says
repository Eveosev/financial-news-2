U.K. Treasury Chief Secretary  Danny Alexander  is considering fuel duty as a way to combat rising
inflation, the Times reported.  “We’re looking at the fuel stabilizer idea and it’s
something that we want to see if it can be made to work,”
Alexander said in an interview with the Times. “We’ll make
announcements on those things at the budget.” U.K. Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  presents the budget on March 23.  A fuel stabilizer would lower taxes on fuel when oil prices
rise and increase them when prices fall. Fuel duty is expected
to raise 27.3 billion pounds ($44 billion) in the fiscal year
through March, according to Treasury estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
