China’s returns on its foreign
exchange investments are dropping because of the global interest
rate environment and the prospects for improvement are not good,
People’s Bank of  China  Vice Governor  Yi Gang  said.  Diversifying the nation’s $2.85 trillion foreign exchange
holdings into commodities is difficult because that would drive
prices higher, hurting China as a major buyer of resources, said
Yi, who is also head of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
