  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  is in talks
with India’s state-controlled Oil & Natural Gas Corp. over a
possible joint bid for Indian offshore exploration licenses, the
Times reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the
matter.  Shell and ONGC are “jointly evaluating” the blocks on
offer and may table their bid before the March 18 deadline, the
newspaper said. The licenses up for auction by the Indian
government include 15 offshore oil blocks, with eight in deep
water, according to the newspaper.    BG Group Plc  is also evaluating the Indian blocks, the
Times reported, citing an unidentified BG spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
