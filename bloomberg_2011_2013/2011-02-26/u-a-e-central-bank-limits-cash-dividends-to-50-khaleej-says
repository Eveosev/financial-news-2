United Arab Emirates banks will be
allowed to distribute 50 percent of 2010 profit in cash
dividends,  Al Khaleej  said, citing a circular issued by the
Central Bank of the U.A.E.  The central bank aims to ensure that banks retain adequate
liquidity as the value of assets and their returns continue to
decline, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
