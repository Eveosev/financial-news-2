Masoud Barzani, president of the
Kurdish Regional Government, comments on violent protests in  Iraq . His comments were posted on the KRG’s website.  “We must respect the institutions and processes democracy
provides us to negotiate our differences in a way that is
peaceful and fair to all. The votes of our people determine the
political faith of our country. These processes cannot be over-
turned through violence or the irresponsible attempts of the few
to impose their will by force. Doing so would fatally undermine
the values we all hold so dear and jeopardize all of the other
rights the practice of democracy grants us. Chaos or
dictatorship is the alternative, where the desires of a few
determine the fate of all. All people of Iraq know the outcome
of such a system well and we will not return to it. In our
pursuit of our common goals of progress and democracy, let us
not trample the very ideals we aim to protect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
