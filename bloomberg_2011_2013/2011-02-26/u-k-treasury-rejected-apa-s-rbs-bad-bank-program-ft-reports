The U.K. Treasury rejected the
creation of a so-called bad bank to manage  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc ’s 195 billion pounds ($314 billion) of toxic
loans, Mark Kleinman reported in the Financial Times.  Stephan Wilcke, chief executive officer of the U.K. Asset
Protection Agency, discussed the idea with the Treasury in
recent months, Kleinman reported, citing people familiar with
the talks. The Treasury rejected it in part because a fresh
guarantee of the loans would be needed, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
