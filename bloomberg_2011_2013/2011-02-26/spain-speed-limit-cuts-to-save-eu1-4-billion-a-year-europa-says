  Spain ’s plan to cut the speed limit
on its highways will reduce the country’s fuel needs by 18
million barrels of crude oil per year, saving 1.4 billion euros
($1.9 billion),  Europa Press  reported, citing unidentified
people at the prime minister’s office.  Spain yesterday said it will reduce the speed limit on
highways to 110 kilometers per hour (68 miles per hour) from 120
kilometers per hour and reduce the price of short- and medium-
distance train tickets from the state-run operator Renfe by 5
percent to cut energy use.  To contact the reporter on this story:
