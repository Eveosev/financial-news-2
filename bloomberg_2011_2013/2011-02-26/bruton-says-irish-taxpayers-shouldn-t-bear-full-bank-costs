Richard Bruton, a lawmaker in
Ireland’s Fine Gael party, said taxpayers can’t be expected to
shoulder all of the cost if stress tests next month reveal
further capital needs in the country’s banks.  “We have to see the stress tests,” Bruton, whose party is
likely to lead Ireland’s next government, said in an interview
in Dublin today. “If that unearths fears of further holes in
the banks, the credibility of expecting the taxpayer to shoulder
all the burden,” is something that “many would regard as
unsustainable.”  Fine Gael won 36.1 percent of first-preference votes in an
election yesterday, according to a poll carried out for Dublin-
based broadcaster  RTE . Labour drew 20.5 percent support. Fine
Gael is unlikely to win a majority in the parliament, and Bruton
indicated he favors a coalition with Labour because it may be
more stable than forming a government with the backing of
independent lawmakers.  “The difficulty of a government made up with independents
is that there tends to be ‘high noon’ negotiations every other
week,” said Bruton, who was re-elected to the parliament. “A
bigger number gives stability.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
