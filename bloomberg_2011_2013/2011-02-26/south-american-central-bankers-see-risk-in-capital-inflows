Central bankers and their
representatives from  Argentina ,  Brazil , Chile, Peru and
Venezuela comment on the increase in capital inflows in the
region. Peru´s central bank, which hosted today´s meeting in  Lima , distributed to reporters a joint statement at the end of
the meeting.  The economists will meet again in Santiago in the second
half of the year to discuss the impact of commodity prices.  “This withdrawal of the monetary stimulus takes place in a
context of strong capital inflows and appreciation pressures.
Various central banks in the region have raised their  interest
rates  while developed economies have kept theirs at historic
lows. This provides incentives for capital inflows.  “Current macroeconomic indicators do not show major
imbalances on an aggregated scale; nevertheless, that does not
imply that in the future capital flows won´t generate risks,
meaning authorities must continue monitoring their impact.  “The inflow of capital is seen to be influenced by the
monetary stimulus in developed economies, which is a response to
their weak recovery. The evolution of this variable as such is a
source of uncertainty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
