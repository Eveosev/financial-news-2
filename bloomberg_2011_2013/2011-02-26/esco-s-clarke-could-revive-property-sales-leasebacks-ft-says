  Philip Clarke ,  Tesco Plc ’s incoming
chief executive officer, may reprise the company’s property sale
and lease-back program, the Financial Times said, citing
analysts Clive Black of Shore Capital and James Anstead of
Barclays Capital.  A sale worth 5 billion pounds ($8 billion) over the next
five years could be possible, said Anstead, according to the
newspaper. Selling up to 7 billion pounds of stores from its 35
billion-pound estate could be the outcome, according to Black,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
