  France  alerted bankers and money
managers to pay “particular attention” to any transaction that
might be linked to assets owned by Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi , his family and associates.  “The efforts at vigilance must particularly apply to all
transactions that might concern assets owned or linked, directly
or indirectly through an intermediary person or legal entity,”
the French Finance Ministry’s Tracfin investigation unit said
today in an e-mailed statement.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday became the first
leader of a major power to call openly for Qaddafi’s
resignation. Security forces loyal to the regime killed
protesters in Tripoli as Qaddafi tried to tighten control of the
capital.  Any suspect transaction must be declared to the ministry,
according to the Tracfin statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
