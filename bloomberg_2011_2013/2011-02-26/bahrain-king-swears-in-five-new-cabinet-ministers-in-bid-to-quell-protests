Bahrain King Hamad Bin Isa al Khalifa, whose nation has been shaken by anti-government
protests in recent weeks, swore in five new Cabinet ministers
and reduced government housing loans by 25 percent.  The king named ministers for housing, labor, health,
cabinet affairs and electricity and water, according to an e-
mailed statement in Manama today released by Bell Pottinger.  Popular uprisings throughout the Middle East have toppled
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt  this year and prompted governments
to boost public spending to ease discontent. Demonstrators in
Bahrain have demanded democracy, free elections and more job
opportunities. Shiites make up between 60 and 70 percent of the
Bahraini Population, while the ruling elite is largely Sunni.  Seven people have been killed in the Bahrain
demonstrations, which began on Feb. 14 and calmed down almost a
week later after the government pulled back tanks and armored
personnel carriers from the city center and offered to hold a
dialog with the opposition.    Libya â€™s  Muammar Qaddafi , whose country belongs to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is facing an
unprecedented rebellion against his four-decade rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
