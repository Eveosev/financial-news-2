Injured Arsenal captain Cesc
Fabregas may get to lift the trophy if the Gunners beat
Birmingham in tomorrow’s Carling Cup final, the  Daily Mail  said.  Fabregas will miss the game with a hamstring injury with
striker  Robin van Persie  serving as captain at Wembley Stadium
as Arsenal seeks its first trophy since the 2005 F.A. Cup.  Gunners players may ask the Spaniard, who’s made three
appearances in the competition this season, to collect the
trophy if they win, the Mail said. Such a move would have to be
agreed to with the Football League in advance, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
