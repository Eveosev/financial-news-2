The U.K. Ministry of Justice will
issue new guidance softening the Bribery Act, the Telegraph
reported, citing an unidentified lawyer who has seen the new
proposal.  The new guidance allows companies to avoid prosecution for
some facilitation payments, or payments made to officials for
performing duties they should normally carry out as part of
their job, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
