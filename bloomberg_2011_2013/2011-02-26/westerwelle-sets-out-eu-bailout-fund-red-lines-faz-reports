German Foreign Minister  Guido Westerwelle  set out “red lines” that would limit the scope of
a permanent European bailout fund for indebted states,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  said, citing a ministry paper.    Chancellor Angela Merkel  has been given the paper which
rules out “preventative” credit lines designed to assist debt-
wracked euro states, the newspaper reported. Specifically, any
bailout fund must be prevented from buying sovereign bonds on
the primary or secondary market, “or related measures,” it
said.  Westerwelle, who is also vice-chancellor and head of the
pro-business Free Democratic Party, said measures such as bond-
repurchase programs would stave off the participation of
creditors in cases of insolvency, according to the newspaper.  The foreign minister also wants penalties against European
states that violate deficit rules to be blocked only if a
majority of member states reject such measures, FAZ reported.  Merkel’s coalition parties on Feb. 22 laid down their terms
for agreeing to a permanent safety net for euro states, limiting
her scope to make concessions at European Union summits next
month. Merkel’s Christian Democratic-led bloc has a coalition
government with the Free Democrats.  To contact the reporter on this story:
