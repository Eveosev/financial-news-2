Immigration in  Europe  will be
boosted by unrest in the Arab world as people flee the affected
countries, according to 81 percent of French people interviewed
in a poll published today by  France Soir .  Sixty-nine percent said it is “probable” the protests
will produce economic and social effects, with 65 percent saying
they will lead to the creation of democratic regimes.  Fifty-nine percent of respondents said the rise of Islamic
parties to power was “probable” and 55 percent judged the
arrival of the countries’ military leaders to power as likely,
according to the poll.  The telephone poll was conducted by Ifop for France Soir
between Feb. 24 and 25. Ifop questioned 969 people at their
homes. No margin of error was reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
