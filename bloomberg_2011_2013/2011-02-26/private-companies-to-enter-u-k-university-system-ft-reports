More private companies and community
colleges will be allowed to become U.K. higher education
providers, the Financial Times reported, citing Higher Education
Minister David Willetts.  The extra institutions will make the university sector more
competitive and therefore help moderate fees, said Willetts, who
spoke at the Universities U.K. conference, the newspaper said.
Private companies involved may include  Pearson Plc , the parent
company of the FT, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
