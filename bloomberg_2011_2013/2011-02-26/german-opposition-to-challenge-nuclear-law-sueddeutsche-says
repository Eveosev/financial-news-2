  Germany ’s opposition plans to file a
legal challenge to last year’s government extension of nuclear
power plant operating lifetimes,  Seuddeutsche Zeitung  said.  The challenge, to be brought by the  Social Democratic Party 
and the  Green Party , disputes Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
decision to bypass the upper house of parliament, or Bundesrat,
the newspaper said. The objection will be filed with the Federal
Constitutional Court on Feb. 28, according to the report.  Changes in the nuclear extension, which the opposition says
are unconstitutional, should have been approved by Germany’s 16
state governments, the challenge cited by the newspaper asserts.
The German states, which finance security measures for the
nuclear plans, are represented in the upper chamber.  Merkel’s coalition last October passed legislation that
permits nuclear plants to run for as many as 14 years longer,
extending an exit from nuclear power that was a cornerstone of
her predecessor, former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The
extension fulfilled a pledge made during her 2009 re-election
campaign that was a core element of her energy platform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
