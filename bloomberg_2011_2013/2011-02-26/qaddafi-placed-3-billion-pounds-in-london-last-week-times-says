Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi 
deposited 3 billion pounds ($4.8 billion) with a private wealth
manager in Mayfair, London last week with the help of a
Switzerland-based intermediary, the Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The intermediary initially attempted to deposit the Libyan
funds with an unidentified stock broking firm in the  City of
London  five weeks ago, however it was turned down, the newspaper
said, citing the chief executive officer of the company, which
it didn’t name.  The CEO, who wasn’t named, was quoted as saying he’d said
“no” because he wasn’t comfortable dealing with people with
blood on their hands. He was cited as saying Qaddafi is believed
to have “about 10 billion in the City.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
