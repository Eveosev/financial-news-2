Vandalism on a train line near
Albertville in the French Alps has delayed about 40,000
travelers, state-owned rail operator Societe Nationale des
Chemins de Fer Francais said today.  The railroad operator discovered this morning that cables
had been sawed through, causing delays of four to six hours in
the Tarentaise valley in the Savoy region of  France , according
to the e-mailed statement. An investigation is underway, SNCF
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
