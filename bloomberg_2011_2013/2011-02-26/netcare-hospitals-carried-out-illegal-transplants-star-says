Illegal kidney transplants were
carried out in at least four South African hospitals, including
three operated by  Netcare Ltd ., South Africa’s largest private-
hospital operator, the Saturday Star reported, citing John
Robbs, a surgeon at St. Augustine’s hospital in Durban.  Netcare’s Garden City Hospital and state-run Charlotte
Maxeke Academic Hospital in Johannesburg together performed 140
illegal kidney transplants, while Netcare’s St. Augustine’s
hospital and Christiaan Barnard Memorial Hospital in  Cape Town 
carried out a further 189 such operations between them, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said today.  Four calls to Netcare’s switchboard and the company
secretary’s office by Bloomberg News today were not answered.
Charlotte Maxeke Academic Hospital didn’t immediately respond to
a phone message left by Bloomberg News requesting comment.  The doctors involved in the so-called cash-for-kidney
program were not employed by Netcare and the company believed
that, while it was not the creator of the program, the plan was
legal, the Star said, citing spokeswoman Martina Nicholson.  Netcare in November pleaded guilty to illegal organ
transplants at St. Augustine’s and was fined 4 million rand
($569,436) in the country’s Commercial Crime Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Franz Wild  in Johannesburg at
