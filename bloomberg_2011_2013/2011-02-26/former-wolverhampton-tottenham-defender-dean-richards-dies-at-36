Former Wolverhampton and Tottenham
defender Dean Richards died today at 36 after a long illness,
the Premier League clubs said in  statements  on their websites.  Richards also played for Bradford City and Southampton
before being forced to retire in 2005 after suffering dizzy
spells and headaches while at Spurs.  Bradford, England-born Richards started his career in 1992
with his hometown club and moved to Wolverhampton three years
later. He made 145 appearances in three seasons at Wolves,
helping the club reach the 1998 F.A. Cup final.  Richards then spent two years at Southampton, before
joining Tottenham in 2001 for 8.1 million pounds ($13 million).
He made 348 league appearances during his 13-year career,
scoring 18 goals, and also played four times for the England
under-21 team.  Wolves and Spurs both said a  tribute  will be paid to
Richards before the Premier League match between the teams on
March 6 at Molineux.  To contact the reporter on this story:
