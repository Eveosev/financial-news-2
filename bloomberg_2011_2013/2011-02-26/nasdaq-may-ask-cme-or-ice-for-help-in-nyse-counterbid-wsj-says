  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc . is considering
partnering with either  CME Group Inc . or Intercontinental
Exchange Inc. to make a counterbid for NYSE Euronext, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the situation.  Deutsche Boerse AG agreed to buy NYSE Euronext on Feb. 15
in an all-share deal valued at about $10 billion. Nasdaq’s joint
counter-offer would need to be around $11 billion to $12 billion
to win approval from bond-rating companies, the newspaper said.  Neither CME nor ICE has agreed to join Nasdaq in pursuit of
NYSE Euronext. ICE management may be more receptive to a joint
offer, due to the attractiveness of NYSE’s European derivatives
business, according to the newspaper.  Nasdaq management will only bid for  NYSE Euronext  if they
consider success to be likely, the newspaper said. Nasdaq will
decide whether to proceed with the counter-offer in the next
week or two, according to the Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
