  Royal Dutch Shell Plc  had a release
of an unknown amount of benzene after an equipment failure on a
distilling unit at its Deer Park refinery and chemical plant in
Texas, according to a company  filing .  Shell’s filing also showed the equipment was repaired.  The Deer Park refinery, a venture between The Hague-based
Shell and Mexico’s state-owned  Petroleos Mexicanos , can process
340,000 barrels of oil a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The complex is 21 miles (34 kilometers) southeast of
Houston on the  Houston Ship Channel .  U.S. refineries must notify the National Response Center if
they release hazardous substances in excess of reportable
quantities, according to the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as
Superfund.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
