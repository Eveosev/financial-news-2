Botswana has severed ties with  Libya 
after objecting to the use of violence against Libyan citizens,
the  Guardian  said, citing Foreign Minister Phandu Skelemani.  The southern African nation “terminated” its relationship
with Libya saying it felt “compelled to take the rare step,”
the Gaborone-based Guardian said on its website. The severing of
relations is with immediate effect, the Guardian quoted
Skelemani as saying.  Libya’s ambassador to Botswana is free to remain in the
country whether he chooses to support Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi or defect, the Guardian said. The termination of
relations with Libya was criticized by some members of
Botswana’s opposition, said the Guardian.  To contact the reporter on this story:
