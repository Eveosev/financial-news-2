Former  New York  Yankees manager  Joe Torre  will oversee Major League Baseball’s on-field operations
following a career that included nine All-Star Games as a player
and the fifth most wins as a manager.  Torre, who led the Yankees to four  World Series  titles and
stepped down as Los Angeles Dodgers manager after last season,
was named the sport’s executive vice president of baseball
operations, Commissioner Bud Selig announced in a news release.  In his new role, the 70-year-old Torre will oversee areas
including umpiring and on-field discipline, making him one of
the sport’s top executives.  “I could not be more excited to work with all the clubs to
help protect the integrity of the game and, hopefully, make it
an even more enjoyable experience for our fans,” Torre said in
the statement.  Torre played parts of 18 major-league seasons for the
Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves,  St. Louis Cardinals  and  New York Mets .  A catcher, first baseman and third baseman, he was a
career .297 hitter, with 252 home runs and 1,185 runs batted in,
and was named the National League’s Most Valuable Player in 1971.  Torre began his managerial career as player/manager for the
Mets in 1977. He also had stints with the Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals before becoming manager of the Yankees in 1996.  New York won the World Series in Torre’s first season
managing the team, as well as in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The
Yankees never failed to reach the playoffs with Torre at the
helm.  He stepped down in October 2007 after refusing a new
contract offer and two weeks later took over as the Dodgers’
manager. With the Dodgers, he made the playoffs in 2008 and 2009.  He has a 2,326-1,997 career record as a manager, trailing
Connie Mack (3,731 wins), John McGraw (2,763),  Tony La Russa 
(2,638) and Bobby Cox (2,504) in career wins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
