Oyj and  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. as the world’s biggest seller of mobile
phones for the third straight quarter, according to an industry
study.  Samsung shipped 105.4 million phones in the three months

global leader in the first quarter of this year.  Asia ’s biggest consumer-electronics company also topped the
global smartphone market with a share of 31.3 percent, trumping
