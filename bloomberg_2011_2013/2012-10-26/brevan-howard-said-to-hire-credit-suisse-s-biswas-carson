Brevan Howard  Asset Management LLP,
 Europe ’s second-largest hedge fund, hired Credit Suisse Group
AG’s Don Carson and Hirak Biswas, according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  Carson, who ran the bank’s U.S. dollar swaps desk, and
Biswas left Credit Suisse’s New York office in the past two
weeks, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified
because the information is private. Carson will work out of
Brevan Howard’s New York office while Biswas will transfer to
Geneva.  Brevan Howard, which oversees $39 billion, is run by Alan
Howard, 49, who started the London-based hedge fund a decade ago
with four other fixed-income traders from Credit Suisse. Brevan
Howard’s main fund posted a 2 percent gain this year through
Oct. 5, according to a person with knowledge of the returns.
Macro funds on average lost 0.7 percent through September, while
hedge funds returned 3.1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Carson previously worked at BNP Paribas in New York and
Banc of America Securities LLC, according to  records  maintained
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Biswas was hired
by Credit Suisse in 2010 as a director in U.S. government
trading, according to a June 2010 memo. He previously traded
long-term government bonds and zero-coupon securities at Morgan
Stanley, the memo said.  A spokesman for Brevan Howard declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
