Euro-area governments can reduce
market uncertainty by tapping into financial firewalls
established to ease the region’s debt crisis, a Mexican finance
official said ahead of a meeting of Group of 20 policy makers.  Mexico’s Deputy Finance Minister  Gerardo Rodriguez  said
that G-20 finance officials meeting in Mexico City Nov. 4-5
won’t call on  Spain  to tap two existing rescue funds.  Still, such an action by any nation would be welcomed by
investors and help consolidate confidence in the euro zone’s
response to its debt turmoil, Rodriguez said.  “To show that they’re effective they have to be used,”
Rodriguez said.  Pressure is building on Spain’s Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  to request a international bailout to strengthen the
government’s finances after he requested in June a 100 billion-
euro rescue of the country’s banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
