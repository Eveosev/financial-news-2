Muse invites arts leaders to visit
Bloomberg’s  New York  headquarters.  This week we welcomed Valery Gergiev, the tireless
conductor of the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, who
brought along his friend and American patron, Frederick Iseman.
We talked about the new opera house, which opens next May.  Playwright Terrence McNally spoke of the coming New York
staging of his play about the premiere of Bellini’s last opera,
“I Puritani.”  Sam Sifton, the national editor of the New York Times and
past food critic, shared caveats and calories from his new book
on Thanksgiving. Please, no garlic or salad.  (Manuela Hoelterhoff is executive editor for Muse, the arts
and leisure section of Bloomberg News.)  Muse highlights include  Lewis Lapham ’s  podcast  and  Greg
Evans  on  movies .  To contact the reporter on this story:
