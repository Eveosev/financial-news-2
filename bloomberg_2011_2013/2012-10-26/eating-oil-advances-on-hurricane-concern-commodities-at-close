The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  rose 0.2 percent to settle at 638.97
at 3:51 p.m. New York time, led by energy.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI gauge of 26  prices  advanced less
than 0.1 percent to 1,565.5.  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil and gasoline rose for the second straight day
on concern that Hurricane Sandy may disrupt U.S. East Coast
production and imports, and the U.S. economy expanded more than
forecast in the third quarter, signaling higher fuel demand.  Sandy will probably grow into a “Frankenstorm” that may
become the worst to hit the Northeast in 100 years if current
forecasts are correct. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2
percent annual rate after climbing 1.3 percent in the prior
quarter, government figures showed.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, heating-oil futures
for November delivery gained 1.2 percent to $3.0978 a gallon.  Gasoline futures for November delivery advanced 0.8 percent
to $2.6991 a gallon.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil climbed on concern that Sandy will disrupt East
Coast refinery production.  On the Nymex, oil futures for December delivery rose 0.3
percent to $86.28 a barrel. The price fell 4.8 percent this
week.  Brent oil for December settlement increased 1 percent to
$109.55 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe 
exchange.  Morgan Stanley failed to buy North Sea Forties blend at a
higher price. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals in
Europe.  Russia will export 5.62 million metric tons of Urals from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, 1.8 million tons from Ust-Luga
and 2.79 million tons from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea next
month, a final loading program showed, in line with a
preliminary schedule released yesterday.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell, capping the first weekly drop since
September, as U.S. inventories approached a record high.  On the Nymex, gas futures for November delivery dropped 1
percent to $3.40 per million British thermal units. The price
declined 6 percent this week, the first drop since Sept. 21.  U.K. gas for same-day delivery advanced as colder weather
pushed demand toward the highest in five months amid a 79
percent decline in deliveries by ship from last year.  The price jumped 4.5 percent to 68.1 pence a therm at 4:25
p.m. London time. Next-month gas rose 2.5 percent to 67.75 pence
a therm. That’s equivalent to $10.90 per million Btu.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold fell for the third straight week, capping the longest
slump in 13 months, because of the dollar’s rally and waning
inflation concerns.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery fell 0.1 percent to $1,711.90 an ounce. The metal
dropped 0.7 percent this week.  Silver futures for December fell 0.1 percent to $32.036 an
ounce.  On the Nymex, platinum futures for January delivery slumped
1.5 percent to $1,546 an ounce.  Palladium futures for December delivery fell 1.5 percent to
$595.40 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper fell, capping the longest slide in more than three
years, as disappointing U.S. corporate earnings stoked concern
that demand for the metal will ebb.  On the Comex, copper futures for December delivery slid
less than 1 percent to $3.55 a pound, dropping for a seventh
straight session, the longest slump since May 2009.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months climbed 0.1 percent to $7,820 a ton ($3.55 a pound).
Aluminum, zinc, nickel and tin fell, while lead advanced.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee futures tumbled to a seven-week low on concern that
the sluggish global economy will erode demand amid ample
supplies.  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for
December delivery slumped 2 percent to $1.5775 a pound. Earlier,
the price touched $1.569, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Sept. 6.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery declined 0.9 percent
to 19.35 cents a pound.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$2,383 a ton.  Cotton futures for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to
72.42 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery dropped 0.5
percent to $1.12 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Corn fell, capping the longest slump in two months, on
signs of dwindling demand for supplies from the U.S., the
world’s biggest producer.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for delivery in
December declined 0.6 percent to $7.3775 a bushel. The price
dropped for the fifth straight day, the longest slump since late
August.  Soybean futures for January delivery slid 0.1 percent to
$15.6375 a bushel.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 1 percent to
$8.6375 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures fell to the lowest in almost four weeks on
speculation that consumers in the Northeast will hold off on
buying beef that may spoil if Sandy spurs electricity
disruptions.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
December delivery fell 0.3 percent to $1.2525 a pound. Earlier,
the price touched $1.2505, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Oct. 1.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement declined 0.6
percent to $1.47075 a pound.  Hog futures for December settlement rose 1 percent to 78.9
cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
