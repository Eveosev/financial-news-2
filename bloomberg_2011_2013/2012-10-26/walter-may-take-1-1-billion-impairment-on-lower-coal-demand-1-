Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) , a producer of
steelmaking coal in the U.S. and  Canada , anticipates taking as
much as a $1.1 billion goodwill impairment charge in the third
quarter because of “recent weakness” in global demand.  “Preliminary indications are that all or substantially all
of the company’s $1.1 billion of goodwill could be impaired and
a corresponding non-cash charge recognized,” Birmingham,
Alabama-based Walter said today in a statement. The company is
scheduled to release earnings Nov. 5 and is expected to report
$34.8 million in net income for the quarter, according to the
average of nine analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Slowing output from steelmakers and the increased
Australian production have caused prices for metallurgical coal,
used to make steel, to tumble. Prices have dropped 39 percent in
the past 12 months to $160 a ton as of Oct. 19, according to the
most recent weekly data from Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy
Publishing Inc.  Walter paid C$5.32 billion ($5.34 billion) in 2011 to
acquire Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp., adding reserves of
metallurgical coal. As slow economic growth damped coal demand,
the shares have declined 40 percent this year, a steeper fall
than the 23 percent drop for the 35-member  Stowe Global Coal
Index. (COAL)   “Given the drop in met coal and slower global growth
expectations, the fair value for the Western Coal assets has
fallen below the value paid by Walter to acquire the company in
2011,” Kuni Chen, a  Stamford , Connecticut-based analyst for CRT
Capital Group LLC, said in an e-mail.  Walter rose 0.2 percent to $36.30 at 9:34 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
