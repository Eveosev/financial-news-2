Russia , the world’s third-biggest
 wheat exporter  last season, will allow 130,000 metric tons a
week of grain sales from stockpiles throughout the country for
millers and feed producers, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Grain sales, which started this week in Siberia and
Russia’s Far East, will be extended to the rest of the country
Nov. 6, the ministry said in a  statement  on its website today.
The state sold 82,985 tons of stocks in the first two days of
trade on Oct. 23-24, out of 110,000 tons that were offered,
according to the Moscow exchange.  Russia’s sales are aimed at decreasing domestic prices
after grain surged in value following this year’s drought.  Farmers harvested 72 million tons of grain and legumes
before drying and cleaning from almost 98 percent of the sown
area by Oct. 23, compared with 94.6 million tons a year earlier,
according to  Agriculture Ministry  data.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to $8.775 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 5:39 p.m. Moscow time.
It’s advanced 34 percent this year.  Editor:  To contact the reporter on this story:
