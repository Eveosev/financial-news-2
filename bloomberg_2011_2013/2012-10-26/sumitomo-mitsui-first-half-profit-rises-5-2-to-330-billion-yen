Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-biggest bank by market value, said first-
half profit probably climbed 5.2 percent as lower credit costs
helped make up for valuation losses from stock holdings.  Net income rose to 330 billion yen ($4.1 billion) for the
six months ended Sept. 30 from 313.8 billion yen a year earlier,
the Tokyo-based lender said in a preliminary earnings statement
today. That exceeded the bank’s forecast for 250 billion yen.  Japanese banks are spending the least amount to cover
losses on loans in at least 12 years, having cleaned up bad
debts that soared in the wake of an asset bubble two decades
ago. At the same time, lenders are losing money from stocks they
hold as part of a practice of companies taking stakes in each
other to cement ties.  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411) , the country’s third-biggest
lender by market value, this month booked a 173.7 billion yen
valuation loss on its domestic stock holdings last quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
