French  consumer confidence  fell for
a fourth month as surging jobless claims and a stalled economy
stoked concern about future earnings.  Household sentiment  dropped to 84 in October from 85 in
September, national statistics office Insee said today in a 
release from Paris. Economists had expected a reading of 84, 
according to the median of 11 estimates gathered by 
Bloomberg News.  With companies such as  Alcatel-Lucent SA (ALU)  and PSA Peugeot
Citroen cutting thousands of staff, unemployment has risen for
17 straight months to its highest since 1999. That’s hurting
confidence at a time when the French economy has failed to
expand for three straight quarters.  “There is no prospect for improvement in the short run,”
said  Dominique Barbet , an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.
“The prospect for wage increase remains extremely thin, which
will further reduce consumers’ demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
