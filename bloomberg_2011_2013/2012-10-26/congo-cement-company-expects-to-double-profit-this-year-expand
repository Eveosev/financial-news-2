Congo New Cement Co., a company
jointly owned by China Road & Bridge Corp. and the Republic of
Congo’s government, expects to double profit this year as it
embarks on an expansion plan to boost output amid a shortage.  The company expects profit to increase to almost 1 billion
 CFA francs  ($2 million) in 2012 from 500 million francs last
year, Eugene Ngangoue, a director of the company, told reporters
today in Brazzaville, the capital.  Production at the company’s plant at Loutete, about 300
kilometers (186 miles) south of Brazzaville, may be doubled to
300,000 metric tons a year to meet increased demand for the
building material, Ngangoue said. Annual demand is estimated at
650,000 tons and may increase to 1.5 million tons by 2015,
according to the Industrial Development Ministry.  President Denis Sassou Nguesso has worked to rebuild the
Central African nation’s economy through investments in mining
and oil after a civil war from 1997 to 1999 left 10,000 people
dead and forced 800,000 more to flee their homes. Congo is sub-
Saharan  Africa ’s fourth-biggest oil producer, pumping 295,000
barrels a day of oil in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical
Review of World Energy.  SONOCC, as the company is known by its French acronym, is
56 percent owned by Beijing-based China Road and 44 percent by
Congo’s government, according to the  U.S. Geological Survey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
