Rubber declined from a one-week high,
paring the first weekly advance in three, as concerns grew that
a slowdown in global economies will curb raw-material demand.  Rubber for March delivery dropped 1 percent to settle at
257.7 yen a kilogram ($3,224 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange. The contract increased 0.9 percent this week.  Gross domestic product  expanded 1.6 percent in the three
months through September from a year earlier, the slowest pace
since 2009, Bank of  Korea  data showed today, adding to signs
that Europe’s debt crisis decelerates growth in  emerging markets .
Asian stocks fell as China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Apple Inc.
joined companies posting results that missed analysts’ estimates.  “Concerns about a global slowdown put a drag on the
market,” said Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research company
JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Futures also declined as the Japanese currency rebounded
from a four-month low against the dollar, reducing the appeal of
yen-denominated contracts, he said.  The yen weakened to 80.38 per dollar, the lowest level
since June 25, before recovering to 79.92 at 4:04 p.m. Tokyo
time. A report showing  Japan ’s consumer prices declined for a
fifth month added to prospects the central bank will expand
monetary easing next week. The Nikkei newspaper reported
yesterday the Bank of Japan will consider increasing its asset-
purchase program by 10 trillion yen to 90 trillion yen.  Rubber for January delivery lost 0.5 percent to close at
24,765  yuan  ($3,970) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board rose to 95.20 baht ($3.10) a kilogram
today from 93.80 baht yesterday, according to the Rubber
Research Institute of  Thailand .  Rains spread across 70 percent of Thailand’s south,
disrupting tapping, according to the institute. The southern
region accounts for 80 percent of the country’s supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
