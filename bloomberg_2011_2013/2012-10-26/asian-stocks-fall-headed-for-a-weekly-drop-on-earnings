Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
index erasing this month’s gains, after companies including
 Fanuc (6954)  Corp. and China Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. reported earnings
that missed estimates.  Fanuc, an industrial robot manufacturer, slid 3.1 percent
in Tokyo, while China Unicom, the nation’s No. 2 mobile-phone
company, sank 7.6 percent in Hong Kong. Woongjin Coway Co., a
maker of water purifiers, surged 12 percent in Seoul after its
parent agreed to stick with a plan to sell a controlling stake
in the company to MBK Parters Ltd.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.1 percent to 121.31 as
of 7:41 p.m. in Tokyo, with about seven stocks falling for each
that rose. The gauge is headed for a 1.8 percent decline for the
week, its steepest drop since August. The measure rebounded
about 12 percent through yesterday from this year’s low on June
4, as central banks in Europe, the U.S. and China added stimulus
to prop up growth.  “The general economy is starting to improve from a low
level,” said  Tim Schroeders , a portfolio manager who helps
manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “But earnings as a whole have been disappointing. It
may take a couple of quarters from here on before things
increase markedly.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13 times  estimated
earnings  on average, compared with 13.5 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 1.4 after the yen
strengthened from a four-month low.  Rally Snaps  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.2 percent, snapping 10
days of gains. Taiwan’s Taiex Index slid 1.8 percent, China’s
Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.7 percent and  Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  retreated 0.9 percent.  South Korea’s Kospi Index sank 1.7 percent after Bank of
Korea data today showed the nation’s gross domestic product
expanded 1.6 percent in the three months through September from
a year earlier, the slowest pace in three years.  Of the 136  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  members that have
reported earnings, and for which  Bloomberg News  has  estimates ,
about 59 percent have fallen short of projections.  Yamaha Corp. (7951)  retreated 8 percent to 717 yen, the  steepest
drop  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, after the Japanese maker of
musical instruments said first-half net income was 3.3 billion
yen ($41.1 million), about half its 6 billion yen forecast.  Fanuc fell 3.1 percent to 12,570 yen. Net income dropped
9.8 percent from a year earlier to 67 billion yen in the six
months ended Sept. 30, missing the company’s 75 billion yen
guidance.  Smartphone Switch  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest camera maker, fell 3.2
percent to 2,560 yen in Tokyo after cutting its annual profit
forecast by 6.4 percent as consumers switch to taking pictures
with smartphones.  China Unicom (762)  retreated 7.6 percent to HK$12.72 in Hong Kong
after third-quarter net income rose 27 percent to 2.02 billion
 yuan  ($324 million). The result, derived from nine-month
earnings reported by the Beijing-based company, compares with
the 2.21 billion-yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.8 percent
today. U.S. jobless claims fell last week, returning to a level
that shows the labor market is making limited progress.  A Commerce Department report today may show the world’s
largest economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate in the third
quarter, according to the median estimate of economists surveyed
by Bloomberg. The  U.S. economy  expanded 1.3 percent in the prior
three months.  Woongjin Coway  Among stocks that rose, Woongjin Coway surged 12 percent to
39,200 won in Seoul after its parent agreed it will proceed with
a contract to sell MBK a 31 percent stake in the company.
 Woongjin Holdings Co. (016880) , Coway’s biggest shareholder, jumped by
the daily limit of 15 percent.  Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) , Australia’s largest investment bank,
advanced 3.5 percent to A$30.85 after saying its first-half rose
increased 18 percent from a year earlier on increased earnings
from its fixed-income, currency and commodity trading business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
