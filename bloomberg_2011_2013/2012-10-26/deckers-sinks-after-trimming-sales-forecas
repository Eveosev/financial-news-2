Deckers Outdoor Corp. (DECK)  fell to its
lowest price in three years after cutting its forecast for
annual sales growth by almost two-thirds amid declining demand
for its UGG brand sheepskin boots.  The shares  tumbled  17 percent to $29.48 at the close in  New
York , its lowest closing price since October 2009. The Goleta,
California-based company’s shares have slid 61 percent this
year.  Sales this year will grow 5 percent, down from a previous
projection of about 14 percent, the company said yesterday in a
statement. UGG sales fell 12 percent in its most recent quarter,
the company said. Chief Executive Officer Angel Martinez said in
the statement that price increases the company took to offset
higher sheepskin costs were hurting sales.  UGG accounted for 87 percent of Deckers’ $1.38 billion in
sales in 2011. The company also makes Teva sandals and Sanuk
shoes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
