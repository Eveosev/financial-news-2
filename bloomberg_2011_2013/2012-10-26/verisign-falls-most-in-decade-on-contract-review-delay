VeriSign Inc. (VRSN) , an operator of Web
domain name registries, fell the most in more than seven years
after it said regulators have delayed a review of the company’s
contract for that business.  VeriSign  plunged  15 percent to $39.39 at the close in New
York, the biggest decline since July 2005. The stock, up 30
percent this year through yesterday, today  led  decliners in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  VeriSign, which operates the registry for .com names,
submitted the company’s agreement to provide that service to the
U.S. Commerce Department on June 26 and anticipated an approval
by Nov. 30, according to a statement yesterday. The agency,
which along with the  U.S. Department of Justice , is reviewing
the agreement and may not complete the review on time, the
Reston, Virginia-based company said.  “This news comes as a major surprise and we believe has
raised significant uncertainties around what was viewed by many,
including us, as a formality,” wrote Todd Weller, a Baltimore-
based analyst for Stifel Nicolaus & Co, in a client note.  The disclosure  “yields significant uncertainty with
respect to how to think about VeriSign’s sustainable growth
profile,” said Weller, who downgraded the shares to hold from
buy.  If the review isn’t finished on time, the Commerce
Department is required to agree to an extension of the .com
Registry Agreement for six months, or another mutually-agreed-
upon “reasonable period,” according to VeriSign’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
