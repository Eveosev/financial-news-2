Spanish  government bonds  fell, with
10-year yields heading for their biggest weekly increase since
August, after a report showed the nation’s jobless rate climbed
to a record last quarter.  Spain ’s  10-year securities  declined for a second day as the
data added to evidence the economy is worsening after its
central bank said this week gross domestic product shrank for a
fifth quarter. German bonds rallied as French household
sentiment worsened and European stocks declined, boosting demand
for the region’s safest assets. Italian securities fell as the
nation sold a combined 4 billion euros ($5.16 billion) of
inflation-linked and zero-coupon debt.  “Contracting pressures in the economy remain persistent”
in Spain, said Elwin de Groot, a senior market economist at
 Rabobank Nederland  in Utrecht. “It will be very hard for the
Spanish government to achieve its budget targets. It is likely
to be negative for the bonds.”  Spain’s 10-year yield climbed six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.67 percent at 12:56 p.m.  London  time,
having climbed 30 basis points this week, the most since the
period ended Aug. 31. The 5.85 percent bond due in January 2022
fell 0.39, or 3.90 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.23.  Unemployment in Spain increased to 25.02 percent in the
third quarter from 24.6 percent in the previous three months,
according to the National Statistics Institute in  Madrid . That
is the highest since at least 1976, the year after dictator
 Francisco Franco ’s death led Spain to democracy.  Deficit Target  JPMorgan Asset Management’s International Fixed-Income
Group cut its holdings of Spanish securities this week to match
the benchmark used to monitor performance as El Confidencial
reported the nation would miss its budget-deficit target,
according to Iain Stealey, a portfolio manager in London.  Stealey said in an interview yesterday that he would buy
Spanish and Italian debt if Spain sought external aid.  The nation’s GDP fell 0.4 percent in the three months
through September from the previous quarter, the Bank of Spain
said in its monthly bulletin released Oct. 23.  Spain may struggle to boost its economy as the government
attempts to impose the deepest budget cuts in three decades,
said Douglas Renwick, a director at  Fitch Ratings  in Barcelona.  “The economic impact might be worse than is currently
being anticipated, that is certainly a risk,” he said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “On The Move” with
 Francine Lacqua .  Spread Widens  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond has dropped more than 2
percentage points from a euro-era high of 7.75 percent reached
on July 25. The extra yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened 11
basis points today to 415 basis points, still below the record
650 basis points in July.  German 10-year yields fell to the lowest level in a week
after  France ’s national statistics office Insee said its measure
of household sentiment in the nation dropped to 84 in October
from 85 the previous month. The Stoxx Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares
slid 0.6 percent.  The 10-year bund yield declined six basis points to 1.52
percent after falling to 1.51 percent, the lowest since Oct. 16.
French  10-year yield  slipped three basis points to 2.24 percent.  Italy Auction  Italy sold 3 billion euros of zero-coupon debt maturing in
September 2014 at a yield of 2.397 percent, compared with 2.532
percent at the previous auction on Sept. 25. The nation also
sold a combined 1 billion euros of inflation-linked debt due in
September 2021 and September 2026.  The yield on Italian 10-year bonds climbed six basis points
to 4.92 percent.  Volatility on Portugal’s government bonds was the highest
in the euro-region markets today, followed by those of the
Netherlands and  Germany , according to measures of 10-year or
equivalent maturity debt, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit default swaps.  German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through
yesterday according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spain’s
securities rose 2.7 percent, and France’s gained 8.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
