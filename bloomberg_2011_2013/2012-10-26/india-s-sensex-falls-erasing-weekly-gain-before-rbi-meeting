Indian stocks fell the most in more
than a week, with the benchmark index erasing a weekly advance,
on concern corporate earnings are weakening globally and before
the  Reserve Bank  of  India  reviews monetary policy next week.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, lost 0.7 percent
to 18,625.34 at the close in Mumbai. The gauge declined 0.3
percent this week.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most
valuable company, fell to a six-week low.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the
second-largest lender, and Hindustan Unilever Ltd., the local
unit of the world’s second-largest consumer-goods maker, dropped
after their earnings reports.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.1 percent as South
Korea’s economy grew at the slowest pace in three years and
companies such as Canon Inc. and  China  Unicom ( Hong Kong ) Ltd.
posted earnings that missed estimates. India’s central bank may
leave its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 8 percent at a
policy review on Oct. 30, according to the median estimate of 28
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “The global cues are not encouraging as some of the
earnings numbers have disappointed,” said Alex Mathews, head of
research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi.
“Some of the local traders are waiting on the sidelines for the
RBI policy. If a rate cut happens, that can be a catalyst for
the next uptrend.”  The Sensex has surged 21 percent this year, the best
performance among major  emerging markets , as  foreigners  bought a
net $18.2 billion of domestic shares, the most among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China. Earnings have
trailed analyst forecasts at only two of the 15 Sensex companies
that have reported results for the quarter ended September,
compared with 40 percent in the three months through June, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rate Outlook  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said Oct. 12 that
India needs cheaper credit, following a revamp of economic
policy that included fuel-subsidy curbs and helped make the
rupee one of Asia’s best-performing currencies in the past three
months. The central bank last month left rates unchanged for a
third straight meeting to fight price increases.  The  authority  will reduce the  cash reserve ratio  by 25
basis points on Oct. 30, according to 11 of 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. India’s inflation, measured by the
 wholesale-price index , rose 7.81 percent last month, the fastest
pace in 2012, fueled by higher diesel costs, government data
showed on Oct. 15.  Indian Earnings  ICICI Bank’s quarterly profit jumped 30 percent, beating
analysts’ estimates, as bad loans fell and lending profit rose. 
Net income  climbed to 19.6 billion rupees ($365 million) for the
three months ended Sept. 30, from 15 billion rupees a year
earlier. That surpassed the 18.7 billion rupee median of
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The shares decreased
0.8 percent to 1,078.35 rupees, after gaining as much as 1.4
percent. The stock has advanced 58 percent this year, the second
best performer on the Sensex.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the maker of Dove shampoo, slid
2.1 percent to 552.20 rupees after second-quarter sales rose 12
percent to 61.6 billion rupees, missing the 62.6 billion rupee
median estimate of 25 analysts.  The S&P  CNX Nifty Index (NIFTY)  of 50 companies dropped 0.7 percent
to 5,664.30 and its November futures settled at 5,699.30. The
BSE-200 Index lost 0.9 percent and the BSE Mid-Cap Index
declined 0.8 percent. The National Stock Exchange of India and
the BSE Ltd.  traded  1.1 billion shares yesterday, 17 percent
more than the 12-month daily average.  Reliance fell 1.4 percent to 798.95 rupees. Drugmaker Cipla
Ltd. retreated 1.9 percent to 354.95 rupees.  ITC Ltd. (ITC) , the
biggest cigarette company, lost 2.1 percent to 285.85 rupees.  Overseas funds were net buyers of Indian shares for a fifth
straight day on Oct. 23, purchasing a net $79.6 million of
shares, according to data from the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
