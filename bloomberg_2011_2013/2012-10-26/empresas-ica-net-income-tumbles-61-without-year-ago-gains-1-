Empresas ICA SAB (ICA*) ,  Mexico ’s largest
construction company, said third-quarter net income tumbled 61
percent from the same period last year, when gains from the sale
of three highways boosted results.  Net income slid to 351 million pesos ($27 million), the
Mexico City-based company said in a  statement  after markets
closed today. Revenue climbed 7.9 percent to 12.3 billion pesos,
in line with the average  estimate  of 12.2 billion pesos of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Two Mexico City highway projects and a subway line were the
largest revenue contributors to the construction business in the
quarter, ICA said. The backlog of projects reached 42.5 billion
pesos, up 7.8 percent from a year earlier and 2.3 percent higher
than on June 30.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a profit measure known as Ebitda, fell 12 percent
to 1.7 billion pesos. Excluding a gain of 440 million pesos from
the sale of two Mexican highways to an affiliate last year,
adjusted Ebitda would have increased 14 percent.  Net income in last year’s third quarter also included a
gain of 1.37 billion pesos from the sale of the Corredor Sur
highway to the Panamanian government.  ICA’s third-quarter financing costs fell 93 percent to 142
million pesos as the company posted a foreign exchange gain of
686 million pesos, compared with a loss of 1.46 billion pesos a
year earlier.  The company’s shares were unchanged at 28.38 pesos at the
Mexico City close, before earnings were released. ICA has risen
68 percent this year, the  second-largest  gain on the benchmark
IPC index of 35 Mexican stocks after Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB, the nation’s third-largest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
