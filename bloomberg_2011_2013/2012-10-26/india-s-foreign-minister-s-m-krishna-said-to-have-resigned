India ’s Foreign Minister S.M. Krishna resigned ahead of a proposed Cabinet reshuffle by Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  tomorrow.  “It is necessary for people like me to make way for the
younger generation,” Krishna said in televised comments today.  Karan Singh may take over as foreign minister, the Times
Now television channel reported, citing people it didn’t
identify. Information and Broadcasting Minister Ambika Soni,
Tourism Minister Subodh Kant Sahai and Minister of Social
Justice and Empowerment Mukul Wasnik also quit today.  A Cabinet reshuffle would come six weeks after Singh
unveiled his biggest policy overhaul in a decade to invigorate
an embattled minority government that faces national elections
within 18 months. The initiative led to the largest coalition
ally quitting, leaving Singh dependent on the whim of regional
parties to pass legislation in parliament.  The Congress party, which won its biggest election victory
in two decades in May 2009, has had to fight off an opposition
onslaught over alleged corruption that has included the 2010
hosting of the Commonwealth Games, a sale of mobile-phone
licenses in 2008, and a coal scandal.  Krishna, 80, was appointed foreign minister in 2009. He was
previously the governor of Maharashtra state and chief minister
of the state of Karnataka.  To contact the reporters on this story:
