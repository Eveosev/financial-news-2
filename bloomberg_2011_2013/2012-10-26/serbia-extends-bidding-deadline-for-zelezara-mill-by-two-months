Serbia  extended the deadline for
bids for Zelezara Smederevo, its sole steel mill, to Dec. 26,
the country’s asset sale authority said.  The two-month extension is meant to give potential buyers
more time to make an offer, Dusan Belanovic, spokesman for
Serbia’s Privatization Agency, said in a telephone interview.
Russia’s NPO Uralvagonzavod OAO is the only company to indicate
interest in the mill.  Serbia put the unprofitable plant up for sale in January,
when the government bought it back from U.S. Steel Corp. for $1.
Potential bidders have to buy documents from the government
before submitting a bid.  NPO Uralvagonzavod, the state-owned maker of battle tanks
and railcars, was the only purchaser of the documents, the
agency said on Oct. 19. The new deadline for buying the sales
papers is Nov. 2, Belanovic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
