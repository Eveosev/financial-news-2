Ethanol futures snapped the longest
streak of losses in six weeks as their discount to gasoline
widened, bolstering the biofuel’s allure to refiners.  Prices rebounded as gasoline’s premium to the biofuel
reached 31.81 cents, the highest level in more than a week,
based on settlement prices. Ethanol is blended with the motor
fuel to stretch supply and meet federal mandates, and refiners
stand to pocket the difference between the two.  “Ethanol was sort of stronger today,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Jupiter, Florida-based alternative
energy broker. “We’re still below gasoline.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery added 0.1 cent to
$2.381 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from
the lowest price since Oct. 16 and snapping the longest losing
streak since Sept. 12. Futures have gained 8.1 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.45 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.545, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf climbed 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to
$2.445 a gallon and in Chicago the additive decreased 0.5 cent
to $2.38.  Gasoline for November delivery advanced 2.27 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.6991 a gallon in New York. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  Trading Premium  Ethanol’s  discount  to the motor fuel expanded to the
highest since Oct. 18 from 29.64 cents yesterday. Gasoline
traded at a premium of 99.8 cents to ethanol as recently as
Sept. 28.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, the Energy Department said
Oct. 24.  Corn for December delivery tumbled 4.25 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.3775 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Based on December contracts for ethanol and corn, producers
are losing about 31 cents on each gallon of the biofuel made,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That doesn’t include
profit from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 1.3 percent to 3.7 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
