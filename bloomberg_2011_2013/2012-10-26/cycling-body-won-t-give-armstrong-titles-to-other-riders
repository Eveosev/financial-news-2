The International Cycling Union
won’t give the titles stripped from  Lance Armstrong  for doping to
other riders, and will back an independent committee to look at
ways to ban former drug cheats from all parts of the sport.  The governing body commented today in an e-mailed
statement.  The UCI decided Oct. 22 not to appeal the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency’s decision to take away Armstrong's record seven Tour de
France titles and ban him from competition in sanctioned events
after the American declined to contest doping allegations.
Armstrong, 41, has denied performance-enhancing drug use and
said he never failed a drug test.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
