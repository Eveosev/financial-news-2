Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli said he will revoke plans to sell land along the
Caribbean coast after violent protests over the sale spread to the
capital, Panama City.  Lawmakers will meet this weekend to repeal a law that allows
the sale of land at a free-trade zone in Colom, the presidentâ€™s
office said today in an e-mailed statement.  Demonstrators blocked streets and clashed with police in
Panama City today following violent protests in Colom after
Congress backed the land sale on Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
