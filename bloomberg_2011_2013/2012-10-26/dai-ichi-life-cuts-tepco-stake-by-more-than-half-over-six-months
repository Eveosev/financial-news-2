Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co. (8750) ,  Japan ’s
second-largest life insurer, sold shares in  Tokyo Electric Power
Co. (9501) , following on with an unwinding of its holdings in the
utility as the stock price collapsed after the Fukushima nuclear
disaster.  Dai-Ichi Life cut its stake in the power company known as
Tepco by at least 59 percent to less than 14 million shares in
the six months ended Sept. 30, according to Bloomberg
calculations using data on Tepco’s website. The Insurer had
reduced its stake to 2.22 percent, or 35.6 million shares, from
3.42 percent in the six months ended March 2012.  “We sold Tepco shares after considering various issues
with the utility,” Yasufumi Maruyama, a spokesman at Dai-Ichi
Life, said by phone. He declined to give details, including
whether the insurer still holds Tepco stock. Tepco spokesman
Yusuke Kunikage declined to comment.  The insurer booked a 110.4 billion yen ($1.4 billion)
charge for losses from securities revaluations, most of it on
Tepco, for the quarter ended March last year. The stock has lost
94 percent of its value since the quake and tsunami in March
2011 caused triple meltdowns and radiation release at the
utility’s Fukushima nuclear station.  On July 31, the government-backed Nuclear Damage Liability
Facilitation Fund took control of the utility in return for 1
trillion yen capital injection to avoid a bankruptcy of Tepco,
which supplies electricity to  Tokyo , Japan’s biggest
metropolitan area.  The state-run fund owned 54.69 percent of Tepco as of
September, while the utility’s employees shareholding
association had 1.26 percent, making it the second biggest
shareholder, according to data on the utility’s website.
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and Nippon Life Insurance Co. hold
1.01 percent and 0.99 percent respectively, according to the
website. Dai-Ichi Life wasn’t on the list.  Tepco reported a net loss of 782 billion yen last fiscal
year which followed a 1.25 trillion yen deficit in the year
ended March 2011 due to costs from the Fukushima disaster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
