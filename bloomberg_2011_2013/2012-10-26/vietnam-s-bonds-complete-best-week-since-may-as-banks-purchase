Vietnam ’s five-year bonds had their
biggest weekly gain since May on speculation banks invested
surplus cash in debt as lending slowed. The dong was steady.  Outstanding bank credit increased 2.77 percent this year
through Oct. 19, trailing a 14 percent gain in deposits, online
newswire VietnamPlus reported today, citing Nguyen Huu Nghia,
chief inspector at the  State Bank  of Vietnam. Loans rose 14.4
percent last year, the government said in May. The  overnight
interbank deposit rate  fell 70 basis points this week to 2.74
percent, the lowest level since Oct. 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Liquidity is still good and the money-market rate has
come down,” said Pham Phuong Lan, Hanoi-based head of fixed-
income and  currency trading  at the Bank for Investment &
Development of Vietnam. “That has increased demand for bonds.”  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds fell 16 basis
points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 10.21 percent this week,
according to a daily fixing rate from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the first decline since the five-day period
ended Aug. 17 and the biggest weekly drop since May 11. The
yield fell three basis points from yesterday.  The dong traded at 20,848 per dollar as of 4:44 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,851 yesterday and little changed from a
week earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
