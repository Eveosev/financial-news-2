Michael Van Gilder, the chief
executive officer of Van Gilder Insurance Co., was sued by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which claims he traded
on confidential information related to Tracinda’s planned
purchase of a 35 percent stake in Delta Petroleum Corp.  Van Gilder was informed of Tracinda’s plan to buy a $684
million stake by a Delta insider and relayed the information to
others, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said today
in an e-mailed statement. Van Gilder and others he tipped made
more than $161,000 in illegal profits from the trades, the
commission  said .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
