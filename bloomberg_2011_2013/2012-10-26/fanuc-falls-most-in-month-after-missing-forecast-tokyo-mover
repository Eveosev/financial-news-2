Fanuc Corp. (6954) , the world’s largest
maker of controls that run machine tools, fell the most in a
month in Tokyo trading after reporting first-half profit that
missed its forecast.  The  robot-maker  dropped 3.1 percent, the most since Sept.
25, to 12,570 yen as of the close. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average
declined 1.4 percent. Fanuc said yesterday that net income fell
9.8 percent from a year earlier to 67 billion yen ($836 million)
in the six months ended Sept. 30.  Profit trailed Yamanashi, Japan-based company’s 75 billion
yen forecast as slower demand for goods in  Europe  dented
production and deterred manufacturers from investing in new
equipment. Fanuc also said full-year profit may drop 2 percent
to 136 billion yen.  “There is a risk the company will miss its new full-year
target,” Credit Suisse Group AG analysts Shinji Kuroda and
Yunchao Zhao wrote in a note today. “Our impression is
negative.”  Fanuc, which gets about half of sales in Asia excluding
 Japan , said first-half revenue fell 1.1 percent and full-year
sales may drop 1.4 percent to 531 billion yen.  Chinese manufacturing contracted for a 12th straight month
in September, based on the preliminary reading for a  purchasing
managers’ index  compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
