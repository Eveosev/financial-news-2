Fitch Ratings  may remove its
negative outlook for  Belgium  if the nation keeps showing
determination to reduce its deficit, according to Douglas Renwick, a director at the company.  “Certainly I think the risks there again have come off
somewhat,” Renwick said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “On The Move” with Francine Lacqua in London.
“They’ve got a very good record in budget consolidation,
meeting their targets.”  Fitch cut the euro-area nation’s credit rating by one step
on Jan. 27 to AA, the third-highest level, and said the country
was at risk of a further downgrade.  If Belgium were to show early next year that “they’re
continuing to bring their deficit down well below 3 percent,
then that would likely cause us to stabilize the outlook,”
Renwick said. Belgium reported a  budget shortfall  of 3.7 percent
last year.  Belgium’s  10-year bonds  rose for the first time in five
days, with the yield falling three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.45 percent at 12:04 p.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
