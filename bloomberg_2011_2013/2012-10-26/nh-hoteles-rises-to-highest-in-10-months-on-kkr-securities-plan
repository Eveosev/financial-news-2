NH Hoteles SA (NHH) ,  Spain ’s largest
business hotel chain, rose to the highest in more than 10 months
in Madrid trading after the company said its considering a
proposal by KKR & Co. LP to issue new securities convertible
into shares.  NH Hoteles gained as much as 4.2 percent to 2.87 euros, the
highest intraday price since Dec. 12. The stock was up 2.3
percent at 2.82 euros as of 10:19 a.m.  “The board has decided to start to analyze the proposal
without that meaning any agreement will be made,” NH Hoteles
said today in a regulatory filing.  Expansion newspaper today reported that KKR was holding
preliminary talks with NH to buy a 16 percent stake in the
hotelier held by Banco Financiero & de Ahorros for 107 million
euros ($138.4 million). Expansion also said that and that KKR
has suggested that NH could carry out a capital increase as an
alternative.  “Shareholders such as banks that are in financial
difficulties are going to have to sell their stakes in traded
companies and firms such as KKR see this an opportunity to buy
cheaply,” said Luis Benguerel, a trader at Interbrokers in
Barcelona.  To contact the reporter on this story:
