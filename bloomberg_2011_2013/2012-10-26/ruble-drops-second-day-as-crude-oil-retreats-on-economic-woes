The ruble retreated for a second day
as crude,  Russia ’s biggest revenue-earner, dropped on concern
economic growth is flagging.  The ruble lost 0.2 percent to 31.4190 per dollar by the
close in Moscow, extending its weekly decline to 1.8 percent.
The currency gained 0.1 percent to 40.5925 against the euro and
was little changed as 35.5471 versus the central bank’s euro-
dollar basket.  Oil sank 0.4 percent to $85.69 a barrel in  New York  by the
close of  currency trading  in Moscow on speculation U.S. economic
growth won’t be enough to boost demand. In Europe,  Spain ’s
unemployment rate rose in the third quarter. Investors pulled
$32 million from Russia-focused equity funds in the seven days
through Oct. 24, the third week of outflows, analysts at UralSib
Capital wrote in an note, citing EPFR Global data.  “There’s a negative mood in general and that’s affecting
all risky assets,” Vyacheslav Smolyaninov, deputy head research
at UralSib Capital, said by phone today. “Macroeconomic
problems in  Europe  continue, the recession is deepening.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.8850 per
dollar in three months.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose three basis points to 181,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields added three basis points to
7.12 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
