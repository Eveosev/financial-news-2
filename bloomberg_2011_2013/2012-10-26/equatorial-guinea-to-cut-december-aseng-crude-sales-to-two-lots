Equatorial Guinea plans to reduce
exports of Aseng crude to two cargoes of 650,000 barrels each in
December, a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  This compares with three consignments totaling 2.55 million
barrels for November.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
