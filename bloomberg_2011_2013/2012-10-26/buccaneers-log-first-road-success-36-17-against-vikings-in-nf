The  Tampa Bay Buccaneers  beat the
Minnesota Vikings 36-17 for their first road win in the  National
Football League  this season.  Rookie running back Doug Martin scored two touchdowns and
accounted for 135 of  Tampa Bay ’s 159 yards rushing as the
Buccaneers improved to 3-4 with their second win in three games.
The Vikings dropped to 5-3 with their first defeat in four games
this season at the Metrodome in Minneapolis.  The Buccaneers led 13-0 as Connor Barth kicked field goals

found Percy Harvin with an 18-yard scoring pass.  Mike Williams 
caught a 3-yard pass from Tampa Bay quarterback Josh Freeman to
restore the 13-point advantage before Blair Walsh made it 20-10
at halftime with a 51-yard field goal for the Vikings.  Less than two minutes into the second half, Martin took a
short pass from Freeman and sprinted for a 64-yard touchdown to
make it 27-10.  After Barth added a field goal from 38 yards,  Adrian Peterson  scored for Minnesota with a 64-yard touchdown run to
make it 30-17 with one quarter to play.  Martin’s second touchdown, on a 1-yard run, gave Tampa Bay
a 36-17 lead with about seven minutes remaining.  Tampa Bay made certain of the win when Leonard Johnson
intercepted Ponder with 57 seconds remaining.  Ponder completed 19 of 35 passes for 251 yards, one
touchdown and one interception, while Freeman completed 19 of 36
