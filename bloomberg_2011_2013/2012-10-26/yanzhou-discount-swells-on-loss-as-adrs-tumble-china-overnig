Chinese equities  sank in New York,
and  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC)  traded at its biggest discount to
Hong Kong in four years, as third-quarter losses overshadowed
signs that the economy is recovering.  The Bloomberg  China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. slid 1.3 percent last week to
94.30, dropping for the first time in five weeks. Yanzhou Coal
tumbled 11 percent last week to trade at an 8 percent discount
to its Hong Kong shares, the most since 2008.  China  Unicom (Hong
Kong) Ltd. posted the biggest weekly slump in a month on
disappointing profit while China Life Insurance Co. fell on Oct.
26 after reporting its first quarterly loss since 2008.  Of the eight companies on the China-US gauge that  reported 
earnings last week, three exceeded analysts predictions,
tempering speculation of a recovery in Asia’s biggest economy
spurred by improving industrial production, manufacturing and
retail sales data.  Maanshan Iron & Steel (323)  Co. and phone equipment
company  ZTE Corp. (000063)  also posted third-quarter losses this week.  “You aren’t going to get any recovery in the earnings
until the fourth quarter as the economy is bouncing along the
bottom,” Sam Mahtani, who oversees about $5 billion as director
of  emerging markets  at  F&C Asset Management Plc (FCAM)  in  London , said
by phone on Oct. 26. “These third-quarter numbers won’t show
that improvement in the economy.”  China ETF Retreats  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 0.5 percent last
week to $36.93, snapping three weeks of advances. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  lost 1.5 percent during the period to 1,411.94.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of domestic shares ended the
week down 2.9 percent to a one-month low of 2,066.21. The Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies traded in Hong
Kong slid 2.2 percent to 10,449.53, the steepest weekly slump in
two months.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US gauge
rebounded to 15.35 on Oct. 26 from 17.25 a week earlier,
compared with this year’s average of 23. The  Bloomberg Chinese
Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a basket of companies that
gained U.S. listings after buying firms that already trade,
added 0.1 percent over the last five days to 71.25, its fifth
weekly advance.  Yanzhou Coal, China’s fourth-largest miner of the fuel,
plunged to $14.32 in the biggest weekly slump in a month. The
American depositary receipts, each representing 10 underlying
shares, traded 8 percent below the Hong Kong stock, the widest
discount since December 2008.  Yanzhou Loss  The company posted a net loss of 79.6 million  yuan  ($12.7
million), it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange on
Oct. 26. The loss compared with a profit of 1.08 billion yuan a
year earlier.  Average coal price for the company fell 19 percent in the
third quarter and operating cost, which includes the cost of
coal sales, rose to 13.03 billion yuan from 10.69 billion yuan a
year ago, it said.  ADRs of China Life dipped 1.6 percent on Oct. 26 to $43.65
and ended the week little changed.  The Beijing-based insurer had a 2.2 billion yuan ($352
million) net loss in the three months ended Sept. 30, reversing
a profit of 3.8 billion yuan a year earlier, China Life said in
a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange on Oct. 26.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (981)  sank 4.1
percent to $1.88 in New York, the steepest weekly loss since the
five-day period ended Sept. 21.  Semiconductor Restructuring  China’s semiconductor industry needs restructuring and
consolidation to create internationally competitive firms, the
Shanghai Daily  reported  Oct. 24, citing a speech by Ding Wenwu,
director general of the Ministry of Industry and Information
Technology, in a Shanghai conference a day earlier.  Beijing-based China Unicom, the nation’s second-biggest
wireless carrier, lost 5.3 percent last week to $16.27, the
lowest since Sept. 7.  The company’s third-quarter profit of 2.02 billion yuan,
reported on Oct. 25, missed the 2.21 billion-yuan median of 
seven analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards on the yuan
strengthened 0.3 percent last week to 6.3485 per dollar,
following a 0.2 percent slide the previous week. The currency
climbed 0.08 percent for the week to 6.2489 versus the greenback
in  Shanghai , after reaching a 19-year high closing level of
6.2417 on Oct. 25, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System.  China-focused equity funds received $913 million of inflows
