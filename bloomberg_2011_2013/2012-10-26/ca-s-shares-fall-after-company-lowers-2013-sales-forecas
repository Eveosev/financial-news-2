CA Inc. (CA) , a maker of software for
managing information technology, fell the most in three years
after cutting its 2013 forecast, citing lower-than-expected
sales of new products amid a weaker global economy.  CA tumbled 8.7 percent to $22.73 at the close in New York,
the biggest decline since October 2009. The shares have climbed
12 percent this year.  The company now sees a 1 percent to 3 percent decline in
full-year fiscal revenue when adjusting for currency
fluctuations, down from a prior estimate of 1 percent to 2
percent growth, according to a statement yesterday. CA cited a
14 percent decline in second-quarter bookings due to lower sales
in its enterprise solutions unit and lower mainframe capacity
revenue. The company’s fiscal year ends in March.  “New product and capacity sales were down approximately 25
percent,” Bill McCracken, chief executive officer of the
Islandia, New York-based company, said yesterday on an analyst
call. Because of the sluggish economy, “we saw sales cycles
elongate and deals slip out of the quarter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
