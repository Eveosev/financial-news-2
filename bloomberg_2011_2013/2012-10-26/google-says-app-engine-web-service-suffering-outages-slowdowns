Google Inc. (GOOG)  said it has fixed the
flaw that caused slow performance and dropped connections on App
Engine, its Web-based computing service that lets software
developers run websites on the search engine’s data centers.  The company shut down traffic and brought the service back
to stability after a glitch this morning prompted certain Google
servers to fail, said Liz Markman, a spokeswoman for the
 Mountain View , California-based company. Google is still looking
into the causes, she said.  “Google App Engine has now been restored and users should
see service returning to normal,” Markman said in an e-mail.
“Our team is still continuing to investigate and determine the
root cause of the issue.”  A majority of clients, usually other websites that host
their own services on App Engine, were experiencing “slow
response” and “inability to connect to services,” according a
Google developer  forum .  Tumblr Inc., social microblogging site, also experienced a
service interruption today at around the same time that Google
reported the outage, at 8:28 a.m. Pacific time. Tumblr later
said service was restored.  Apart from using warehouse-sized data centers to deliver
its own services, Google generates income by renting out
computing power, storage and services to other websites. Today’s
outage was the first since Google began offering a more  reliable
way  to store and access data in January 2011, Markman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
