A suicide bomber killed at least 41
people and wounded more than 30 at a northern  Afghanistan  mosque
where the police chief and governor had gathered during a
religious holiday, a local official said.  The attack in Faryab province came as worshipers gathered
to celebrate the Eid al-Adha holiday, deputy governor Abdul
Satar Barez said by telephone, adding that the police chief was
wounded. The dead included 23 security personnel and 18
civilians, and the number will probably rise, he said.  The bombing appears to have been one of the deadliest since
a December explosion targeting worshippers at the Abul Fazl
shrine in Kabul killed 55 people. A suicide bomber killed 12
people, including eight South Africans, in an attack last month
claimed as revenge for an anti-Islam film made in the U.S.  In an Eid al-Adha message to the nation, President  Hamid Karzai  had earlier urged Taliban insurgents to stop killing
other Afghans, the  Associated Press  reported. He called on
militants to stop destroying mosques, hospitals and schools, the
AP said.  On Oct. 1, a suicide bomber detonated explosives near a
joint Afghan and NATO patrol in eastern Afghanistan, killing six
civilians, four local policemen and three foreign soldiers.
Taliban spokesman  Zabihullah Mujahed  said the group carried out
the attack.  The U.S. plans to withdraw most of its remaining 68,000
combat soldiers in Afghanistan by the end of 2014 as it hands
over operational control in the 11-year war against the Taliban
to Afghan forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
