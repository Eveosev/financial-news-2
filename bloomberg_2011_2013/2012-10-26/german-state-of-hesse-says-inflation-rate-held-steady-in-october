Inflation in the German state of
Hesse held steady in October.  The inflation rate remained at 2 percent, the stateâ€™s
statistics office in Wiesbaden said in an e-mailed statement
today. Economists forecast that  German inflation , calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, will slow to 2 percent
from 2.1 percent in September, the median of 8 estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey  shows. That report will be released on
Oct. 29, based on data from six states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
