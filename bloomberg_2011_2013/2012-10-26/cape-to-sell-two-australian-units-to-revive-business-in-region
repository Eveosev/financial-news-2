  Cape Plc (CIU) , a supplier of
scaffolding, fire protection and cleaners to energy companies,
will sell two businesses in  Australia  as it tries to revive
performance in the region.  The Singapore-based company, whose shares slumped in August
when it said performance in Australia was “well below”
expectations, will dispose of a hire and sales business and a
blasting workshop facility, said Ben Simons, a spokesman for the
company in  London .  “Whilst successful profitable businesses, Cape believes
they will develop more strongly under new ownership,” Simons
said in an e-mail. “It is too early to comment on the potential
proceeds, but Cape is not expecting that they will be
material.”  Cape said in August that problems in its Asia-Pacific
region will probably persist into next year. The company, which
has a market capitalization of about 325 million pounds ($524
million), lost about 18 percent of its value this year.  The company said Aug. 30 that revenue grew 9.8 percent
based on constant 2011 exchange rates to 371.6 million pounds in
the first half. Adjusted profit before tax fell to 12 million
pounds from 34 million pounds.  On Aug. 1, Cape had said the company was unlikely to meet
prior expectations for the year and “challenging” conditions
in Asia-Pacific would probably persist into 2013. That came
about two months after Cape took a 14 million-pound charge from
the Arzew liquefied natural-gas project in  Algeria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
