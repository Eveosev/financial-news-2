Current TV, the cable network
founded by former vice president  Al Gore , put itself up for sale
after receiving overtures from potential suitors.  “Current has been approached many times by media companies
interested in acquiring our company,” San Francisco-based
 Current TV  said today in an e-mailed statement. “This year
alone, we have had three inquiries. As a consequence, we thought
it might be useful to engage expertise to help us evaluate our
strategic options.”  The company is interviewing investment banks, the New York
Post reported earlier today, citing an unidentified source. The
network was created in 2005 by Gore and  Joel Hyatt , the co-
founder of Hyatt Legal Services. It is available in 60 million
U.S. households, and 70 million worldwide, according to its
website.  Among Current TV’s programs are “The War Room,” featuring
former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, and
“Viewpoint,” hosted by  Eliot Spitzer , New York’s former chief
executive, also a Democrat. Gore served under President  Bill Clinton .  The business generated $101 million in revenue and $11.8
million in cash flow last year, the research firm SNL Kagan
estimated. The bulk of those sales came from cable-TV operators
who paid on average 12 cents per subscriber each month. By
comparison,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  takes in more than $5 per subscriber
for its ESPN sports network, the industry leader.  To contact the reporter on this story:
