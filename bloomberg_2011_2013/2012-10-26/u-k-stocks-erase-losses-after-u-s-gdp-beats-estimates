U.K. stocks erased losses after U.S.
data showed the worldâ€™s largest economy expanded more than
economists forecast in the third quarter.  The FTSE 100 Index rose less than 0.1 percent to 5,807.07
at 1:41 p.m. in  London . The gauge earlier declined as much as
0.9 percent.  Gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services
produced in the U.S., rose at a 2 percent annual rate after
climbing 1.3 percent in the prior quarter, Commerce Department
figures showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 86
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.8 percent gain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
