A plan to temporarily remove carbon
permits from auctions planned for next year may result in an
unacceptably high price,  said EON AG .  “The system is likely to be highly sensitive to the back-
loading volume chosen,” the utility said in a submission
published on an  EU website . “Altering this volume by a couple
of hundred million EU allowances could make the difference
between an ineffective measure and an unacceptably high EU
allowance price. The range of back-loading volumes that would
produce an acceptable rise in the EU allowance price may be
relatively small and difficult to pinpoint.”  The volume should be derived from the bloc’s emissions-
reduction goals, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
