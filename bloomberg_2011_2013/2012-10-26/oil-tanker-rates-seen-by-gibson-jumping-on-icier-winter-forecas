Rates for  oil tankers  in the Baltic
and North seas may jump this winter on forecasts for harsher
weather, increasing demand for Aframax ships able to sail
through ice, according to E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  “The seasonal factors of poor weather, ice, fog and the
resulting delays come together to cause havoc to vessels’
itineraries and hence restrict the volume of vessels available
for trade, ultimately pushing up rates,” the London-based
shipbroker said in an e-mailed report today. “If the winter is
as bad as the weather fraternity predict we could see earnings
skyrocket.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
