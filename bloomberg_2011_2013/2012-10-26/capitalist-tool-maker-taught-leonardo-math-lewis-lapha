In 1494, Luca Pacioli published his
mathematical encyclopedia, with a section devoted to double-
entry bookkeeping. The foundation of accounting, this system of
numbers propelled the growth of capitalism and the modern
economy.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  After learning the subject from Pacioli’s book, Leonardo da Vinci got him a job in Milan as the first Chair of Mathematics.
There, he helped Leonardo develop linear perspective for the
“Last Supper,” while the artist gave Pacioli insight on the
golden ratio for his next book.  When the French army of Louis XII invaded Milan in October
1499, Pacioli was dragged from his lodgings and his mathematical
models destroyed by soldiers who deemed them the devil’s work.  Along with other refugees, Pacioli and Leonardo were forced
to flee to Mantua.  I spoke with Jane Gleeson-White, author of “Double Entry:
How the Merchants of Venice Created Modern Finance,” on the
following topics:  1. Quantification of Capital  2. Church Challenge  3. Last Supper  4. Purpose Equals Profit  5. Non-Monetary Transactions  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
