(Corrects month in the headline.)  Cotton futures fell, capping the
biggest weekly drop in more than four months, on signs that
world supplies are outpacing demand.  Orange juice  declined.  Cotlook Ltd., the publisher of a benchmark cotton index,
boosted its estimate for a global fiber surplus by 16 percent,
citing higher output in China and  India , the world’s top
producers. The crop in the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter,
was 38 percent harvested as of Oct. 21, up from 28 percent a
week earlier, the Department of Agriculture said this week.  “Crop pressure builds both in the U.S. as well as in
foreign growths, with India probably posing the biggest threat
in that regard” Peter Egli, a Chicago-based director of risk
management at Plexus Cotton Ltd., said in a report.  Cotton for December delivery slid 0.4 percent to settle at
72.42 cents a pound at 2:34 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . The fiber fell 5.8 percent this week, the biggest weekly
slump since June 1.  “There will be downward pressure on prices for the next
couple of months,” as harvests progress around the world, Jon Devine, a senior economist for Cotton Inc. said in an interview
in New York. “The biggest factor pressuring prices is the
global surplus,” which could send prices to 65 cents if support
at 70 cents is broken, he said.  Orange-juice futures for January delivery fell 0.5 percent
to $1.12 a pound on ICE, the fourth drop in five sessions. The
price declined 1.1 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
