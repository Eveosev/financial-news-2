An Argentine judge issued an
injunction against  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s biggest
maker of  wind turbines , ordering it to keep providing services
to local energy company Genneia SA.  Vestas Chile Turbinas Eolicas Limitada and Vestas Argentina
SA, both subsidiaries of the Copenhagen-based wind turbine
maker, will have to continue fulfilling services contracted by
Genneia for a wind park, Genneia said in a note sent today to
the market regulator.  Vestas will have to continue providing their services even
though Genneia hasn’t been able to pay a $19.8 million service
fee in dollars because of Argentina’s obstacles to acquire
foreign currency, Genneia said, citing a ruling issued by a
federal judge.  Genneia added in its three-page filing that it offered to
Vestas to cancel its dollar-denominated debt by using pesos and
also filed a petition with the Argentine Central Bank to receive
authorization to acquire the dollars. The request hasn’t yet
been answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
