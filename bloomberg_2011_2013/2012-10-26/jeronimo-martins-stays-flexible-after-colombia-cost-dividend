Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest retailer, said it has the flexibility to exploit
investment opportunities that may arise even after paying an
extraordinary dividend and as it expands in Colombia and  Poland .  “The performance of the business is robust and the
capacity of the group to generate strong and sustainable cash
flow have become more evident over the past 18 months,” Chief
Financial Officer Alan Johnson said on a conference call
yesterday. The extraordinary dividend “does not change in any
way our current dividend policy.”  Jeronimo Martins, which owns the Pingo Doce supermarket
chain in Portugal and Poland’s leading discount-store operator,
Biedronka, plans to open its first stores in Colombia by the end
of the first quarter of 2013, Rita Fragoso, a spokeswoman for
the Lisbon-based company, said last month.  “We continue our preparations to start operations in
Colombia and we will cover this in more detail at the investor
day meeting in December,” said Johnson. Acquisitions may play a
role in Jeronimo Martins’ plans to expand in the South American
country, he said on March 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
