Scrap-steel prices in the U.S., down
26 percent this year, may rebound next month, according to
Spencer Johnson, a risk manager at INTL FCStone Inc.  “Mills are already raising prices for finished steel, and
part of the reason may be that they’re expecting higher costs”
for scrap metal used to make steel, Johnson said in a telephone
interview today from New York.  Producers are likely to be partially successful in their
bid to charge more for finished steel, and may try again to push
for the higher price next month, he said.  The average  price  of shredded steel scrap fell 3.7 percent
in September to $392.50 a long ton, according to Steel Business
Briefing data. Last year, recycled metal surged 12 percent,
after a 40 percent increase in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
