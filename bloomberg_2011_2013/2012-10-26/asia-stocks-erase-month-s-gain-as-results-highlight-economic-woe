Asian  stocks  fell this week, with
the regional index erasing the month’s gains, as companies
including  Fanuc (6954)  Corp. and  China  Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. reported
earnings that missed estimates amid global growth concerns.  Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots, slid 5.4 percent in
 Tokyo , while China Unicom, that nation’s No. 2 mobile-phone
company, sank 5.8 percent in Hong Kong. Tohoku Electric Power Co.
plunged 21 percent, leading declines among Japanese utilities on
concern higher fuel prices will crimp earnings. Jupiter
Telecommunications Co. jumped 31 percent in  Osaka  as KDDI Corp.
and Sumitomo Corp. offered as much as 216 billion yen ($2.7
billion) to buy the rest of the company.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.6 percent this week to
121.54, paring the measure’s rebound from a June 4 low to less
than 12 percent. Shares had risen as central banks in  Europe ,
the U.S., and China added stimulus to prop up growth.  “External factors such as the  European debt crisis  and the
U.S. elections are still the biggest risks for the market,”
said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds Management
in Sydney, which manages more than $350 million. “Earnings are
hostage to these macroeconomic factors.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 12.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 12.1 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  dropped 0.8 percent even
as the yen closed on Oct. 25 at below 80 to the dollar for the
first time since June.  Rally Snapped  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed for the week
after snapping on Oct. 26 its longest streak of gains since 2006.
Taiwan’s Taiex Index slid 3.7 percent, China’s Shanghai
Composite Index dropped 2.9 percent and  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index (AS51)  retreated 2.2 percent.  “Earnings in Hong Kong and China have not been so good,
but most of the rally is being driven by expectation that growth
is bottoming in China,” said  Binay Chandgothia , a Hong Kong-
based portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors, which
oversees $250 billion. “In order to see the rally move up
further, you’re going to need stronger economic growth or you
need the corporate sector to show better profitability.
Otherwise, you might just see a period of consolidation.”  South  Korea ’s Kospi Index sank 2.7 percent after Bank of
Korea data Oct. 25 showed the nation’s gross domestic product
expanded 1.6 percent in the three months to September from a
year earlier, the slowest pace in three years.  U.S. Stocks  In the U.S. the S&P 500 fell 1.5 percent as companies from
3M Co. to DuPont Co. reported disappointing quarterly results
and forecasts. All 10 groups in the S&P 500 fell for the week.
DuPont tumbled 8.4 percent after saying it will eliminate about
1,500 jobs amid a smaller-than-estimated profit. 3M plunged 5.3
percent as it reduced its full-year projection.  Of the 134  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  members that reported
earnings by 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 26, and for which Bloomberg News
had  estimates , about 58 percent fell short of projections.  Fanuc fell 5.4 percent to 12,570 yen. Net income dropped
9.8 percent from a year earlier to 67 billion yen in the six
months ended Sept. 30, missing the company’s 75 billion yen
guidance.  Canon Inc., the world’s largest camera maker, fell 3.4
percent to 2,560 yen in Tokyo after cutting its annual profit
forecast by 6.4 percent as consumers switch to taking pictures
with smartphones.  China Unicom  China Unicom retreated 5.8 percent through the week in Hong
Kong after third-quarter net income rose 27 percent to 2.02
billion  yuan  ($324 million). The result, derived from nine-month
earnings reported by the Beijing-based company, compares with
the 2.21 billion-yuan median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Among stocks that rose after reporting earnings,  Macquarie
Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s largest investment bank, advanced 3.5
percent to A$30.85 after saying its first-half profit increased
18 percent from a year earlier on increased earnings from its
fixed-income, currency and commodity trading businesses.  Jupiter Telecommunications soared 31 percent to 108,500 yen.
KDDI, Japan’s No. 2 mobile-phone company, and Sumitomo, a
trading firm, offered to buy the remaining 21 percent they don’t
own at 110,000 yen per share, the companies said in a statement
Oct. 24. The offer is 33 percent higher than Jupiter’s price Oct.
19, the last trading day before the Nikkei newspaper published a
report about the plan. KDDI rose 4.3 percent and Sumitomo
dropped 1.4 percent.  Japanese utilities had six of the 10 biggest declines on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index through the week. Fuel costs for
 Japan ’s nine generators will rise by 3.2 trillion yen to about
6.8 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending March 2013, according
to estimates from a government panel. Tohoku Electric plunged 21
percent to 554 yen.  Kansai Electric Power Co., Kyushu Electric Power Co. and
Hokkaido Electric Power Co. said they haven’t decided on whether
to issue a year-end dividend. The comments followed reports by
the Nikkei newspaper that all three are considering skipping the
payment. Kansai Electric retreated 13 percent, Kyushu Electric
dropped 18 percent, and Hokkaido Electric sank 17 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
