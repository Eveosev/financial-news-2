Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil producer, won’t provide funding next year
for a 1,300-kilometer (808-mile) ethanol pipeline it co-owns and
will focus its investments on other priorities, according to an
 article  by O Estado de S. Paulo.  Other project backers are seeking ways to make up for the
funding shortfall, Alberto da Fonseca Guimaraes, chief executive
officer of Logum Logistica SA, which is developing the project,
said in the Sao Paulo-based newspaper today.  Petrobras, as the  oil company  is known, Raizen Energia SA,
Grupo Copersucar and Odebrecht Transport SA each own 20 percent
of the project that will link the states of Goais,  Minas Gerais ,
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Uniduto Logistica SA and Camargo
Correa SA each hold 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
