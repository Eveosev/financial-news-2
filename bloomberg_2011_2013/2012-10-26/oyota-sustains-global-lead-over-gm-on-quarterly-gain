Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s worldwide sales
grew 18 percent last quarter on U.S. demand for Camry sedans and
Prius hybrids and helped  Asia ’s largest automaker expand its
lead over  General Motors Co. (GM) , the global volume leader in 2011.  Toyota delivered 2.43 million cars and trucks in the
quarter that ended Sept. 30, including subsidiaries  Hino Motors
Ltd. (7205)  and  Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262) , up from 2.06 million a year ago,
according to figures provided by Yurika Motoyoshi, a company
spokeswoman, yesterday. Its sales rose 28 percent to 7.4 million
units through September. GM had 2.28 million sales in the
quarter and 6.95 million this year through September,  Jim Cain ,
a company spokesman, said in a phone interview yesterday.  “Thinking back to the start of the year, I didn’t expect
Toyota to recover as quickly as it has,” said Ed Kim, an
industry analyst at researcher AutoPacific Inc. in Tustin,
 California . “Toyota has such a huge and massive owner base that
keeps coming back for more and more. That was underestimated.”  President Akio Toyoda plans to introduce 19 models this
year as Toyota heads toward regaining the title of the world’s
biggest carmaker. The Toyota City, Japan-based company is
counting on the U.S. to make up for falling sales in China,
where a territorial dispute with  Japan  threatens Toyota’s goal
of selling a record 9.76 million vehicles globally in 2012.  China , U.S.  Toyota’s sales in China fell 49 percent in September, the
biggest drop since January 2002, according to company figures.
In the quarter, Toyota sold 197,700 units in China, 23 percent
fewer than last year, the company said Oct. 9. Dion Corbett, a
Tokyo-based spokesman at the company, said at the time that
meeting the annual China target was “looking very difficult.”  By comparison, U.S. sales of Toyota, Lexus, and Scion
vehicles rose 38 percent in the quarter that ended in September
to 525,328 units. That boosted the carmaker’s market share this
year through September to 14.4 percent from 12.5 percent a year
earlier, according to Autodata Corp., a  Woodcliff Lake , New
Jersey-based industry researcher.  Toyota wants to boost U.S. sales by about 30 percent this
year, aided by a 20 percent increase in October, Bill Fay, the
company’s group vice president for U.S. sales, said this week.
Through September, Toyota’s U.S. sales rose 32 percent to 1.57
million vehicles.  Based on sales through September, Toyota may deliver about
2 million vehicles in the U.S. this year, its highest volume in
that market since 2008, based on a Bloomberg calculation.  Volkswagen Rises  GM’s U.S. light-vehicle sales grew 1.8 percent in the July-
September quarter to 652,002. The Detroit-based automaker’s U.S.
market share this year through September fell to 18.1 percent
from 20 percent, according to Autodata.  Toyota earlier this year said it expected sales in 2012 to
top its previous record -- 9.37 million units in 2007 -- by
about 4 percent and that it would produce a  record  10.05 million
units.  GM, which ceded its lead to Toyota in global auto sales in
2008, regained the top ranking last year after Toyota’s
production was hobbled by natural disasters in Japan and
Thailand.  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  raised its global deliveries 13 percent to
2.3 million in the most recent quarter, the Wolfsburg, Germany-
based company said this week. Volkswagen group sales, including
Porsche AG, grew 11 percent to 6.9 million this year through
September. Excluding heavy trucks, VW vehicle sales rose 9.7
percent to 6.71 percent, according to company statement.  China Dispute  Japan’s purchase last month of East China Sea islands,
called Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, sparked
violent demonstrations in China that disrupted production for
Japanese businesses and dented demand for their goods.  In  Europe , sales of Toyota and Lexus cars rose 13 percent
to 206,643 units in the third quarter, led by a boost in
deliveries of gasoline and hybrid versions of Yaris compacts,
the company  said  Oct. 9.  By comparison, industrywide sales shrank 9.2 percent to
2.83 million units last quarter, according to the Brussels-based
 European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association .  GM declined 1.5 percent to $23.28 at the close yesterday
in  New York . Toyota’s American depositary receipts fell 1.4
percent to $77.36.  To contact the reporters on this story:
