The  Los Angeles  City Council voted
to raise the  retirement age  for new municipal employees to 65
from 55 and to reduce their pension benefits, a move the city’s
budget analyst said would save as much as $4.3 billion over 30
years.  The council’s 10-0 vote also  limits  pension payments to 75
percent of final salary, according to a summary to council
members from City Administrative Officer  Miguel Santana .  Los Angeles, under its city charter, was exempt from a bill
signed by California Governor  Jerry Brown  in September that
raised the retirement age for non-safety personnel to 67 from
55. Both the city and state will require new employees to pay
for half of their retirement benefits. Neither California nor
its most populous city is doing away with guaranteed pension
benefits in favor of 401(k)-style plans.  Without the changes, employee retirement costs were
projected to increase $154 million, or 45 percent, by June 2017,
Santana said in his report. That sum is enough to hire 770
police officers or firefighters, repave 440 miles of streets or
fill 7.3 million potholes, he said.  Union leaders and city employees spoke against the
measures, saying they breach the city’s commitment to its
employees.  Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa , who can veto the council’s
vote, has expressed support for the pension changes that would
take effect July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
