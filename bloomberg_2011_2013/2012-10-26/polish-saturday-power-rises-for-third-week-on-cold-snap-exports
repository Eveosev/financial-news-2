Polish electricity for Saturday
climbed for a third week amid forecasts for cold weather and
increased exports.  Power for tomorrow  rose 1.2 percent from a week earlier to
177.65 zloty ($55.61) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Minimum temperatures in Warsaw are forecast to fall to
minus 2 degrees Celsius (28 Fahrenheit) tomorrow, compared with
a 10-year average of 5 degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data show.
Colder weather boosts power demand for heating. Exports of
electricity to the  Czech Republic ,  Germany  and Slovakia were set
to rise.  Polish power for next year was little changed at 177 zloty
a megawatt-hour. The contract has lost 2.8 percent since Oct.
19, its 10th weekly decline.  Next-day contracts on the Czech market settled 6.6 percent
higher than a week ago at 40.94 euros ($53.01) a megawatt-hour,
while Hungarian and Slovak power increased 6.4 percent to 40.98
euros a megawatt-hour, according to the countriesâ€™ market
operators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
