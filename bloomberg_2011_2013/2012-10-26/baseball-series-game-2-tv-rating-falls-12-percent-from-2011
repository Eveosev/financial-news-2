World Series television ratings
continued to lag last year’s championship as the  San Francisco
Giants  took a 2-0 lead in their matchup with the Detroit Tigers.  The Giants’ 2-0 victory last night in Game 2 of Major
League Baseball’s World Series was seen on Fox in 7.8 percent of
U.S. homes, the News Corp. network said in a news release,
citing initial national data from  Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN)  That’s a
12 percent smaller rating than the equivalent game did in 2011
in a series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers.  Yesterday’s rating was 3 percent higher than the Game 1
rating two days ago. That contest’s rating trailed its 2011
equivalent by 13 percent.  Game 3 of the best-of-seven series is tomorrow at Comerica
Park in Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
