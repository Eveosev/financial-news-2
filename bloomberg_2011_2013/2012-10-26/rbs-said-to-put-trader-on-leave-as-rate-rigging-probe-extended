Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  put
Ken Choy, a Singapore-based foreign exchange trader, on leave as
regulators extend their probes into rate-manipulation beyond
interbank lending rates, said a person briefed on the matter.  Choy, a director in the bank’s  emerging markets  foreign
exchange trading unit, was suspended following an inquiry into
the possible manipulation of the rates used to set non
deliverable-forwards, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the investigation is private.  He is one of the first traders to be suspended or fired
over the attempted manipulation of NDFs, a derivative traders
use to speculate on the movement of currencies that are subject
to domestic foreign exchange restrictions. The Monetary
Authority of  Singapore  last month extended the scope of its
probes into rate-rigging to include NDFs.  Choy didn’t answer calls after office hours in Singapore. A
spokeswoman for RBS in  London  declined to comment. The news was
reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
