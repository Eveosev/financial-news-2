Westfield Group (WDC) , the world’s biggest
mall operator, agreed to sell a 260 million-pound ($419 million)
center it plans to build in the English city of Bradford to
investors led by property fund manager Meyer Bergman Ltd.  Westfield plans to start building the 550,000 square-foot
(51,000 square-meter) center in central Bradford in the second
half of next year, according to an e-mailed statement today. On
completion, it will manage the center for the future owners, a
fund managed by Meyer Bergman, Healthcare of Ontario Pension
Plan and a second unidentified Canadian pension fund.  Westfield has secured commitments from retailers including
Marks & Spencer Plc, Debenhams Plc and Next Plc to lease a total
of 36 percent of the space in the mall, Westfield said.  “Bradford city center has been without an adequate retail
offer for over 20 years,” George Walsh-Waring, director of
development at Meyer Bergman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
