NetSuite Inc., the software maker
majority-owned by  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s  Larry Ellison , surged to a
record after customer gains spurred higher-than-expected sales
growth and the company raised its full-year forecast.  Shares of San Mateo, California-based NetSuite jumped 15
percent to $65.40 at the close in New York, the highest since
the stock began trading in 2007. The stock has increased 61
percent this year.  NetSuite is working to expand its customer base in the
crowded market for online business applications against
companies including  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) ,  SAP AG (SAP) , Microsoft Corp.
and Oracle. NetSuite yesterday raised its full-year sales
forecast to a range of $306.3 million to $306.8 million, from a
prior projection of $300 million to $305 million. Analysts on
average had projected 2012 revenue of $304 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “As some traditional enterprise software companies
struggled, NetSuite again exceeded our stated outlook and
delivered record revenue and non-GAAP EPS,” Chief Executive
Officer Zach Nelson said in a statement yesterday.  Full-year earnings excluding some items will be 23 cents to
24 cents a share, higher than a previous range of 19 cents to 21
cents. The average analyst estimate was 23 cents.  Third-quarter sales rose 31 percent to $79.8 million,
helped by a 60 percent increase in the number of deals worth
more than $200,000 as more mid-size companies added NetSuite
products.  The net loss in the quarter widened to $8 million, or 11
cents a share, from $6.9 million, or 10 cents, a year earlier.
Profit excluding some items was 8 cents a share, beating
analysts’ estimate by 2 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
