Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan ’s largest maker
of liquid-crystal displays, rose the most in seven weeks in
Tokyo trading after the Asahi newspaper reported the company is
seeking capital alliances with U.S. technology firms.  The shares  rose  as much as 10 percent to 176 yen, headed
for the biggest gain since Sept. 4, and changed hands at 175 yen
as of 10:09 a.m. The stock is the best performer today in the
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which rose 0.2 percent.  Sharp is trying to get investments from  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ,
Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Google Inc. and Apple Inc., the
Asahi reported, without saying where it got the information. The
Japanese company is seeking more partners after renegotiations
with Foxconn Technology Group over a stake sale stalled, the
report said.  “We are not in talks with any of those firms on a capital
alliance,”  Miyuki Nakayama , a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Sharp,
said by telephone today. “In terms of business alliances, our
policy is not to comment on discussions with any specific
partners.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
