Central Falls  had its  credit rating 
raised two steps by Moody’s Investors Service, citing reduced
fiscal strains after Rhode Island’s smallest city emerged from
bankruptcy last month.  Debt-service payments were maintained by Central Falls as
it became the first city in state history to enter bankruptcy
last year. A court-approved exit plan calls for full repayment
to bondholders while employee pensions are cut. Moody’s also
raised its outlook for the credit to positive.  “The bankruptcy process has resulted in a significant
reduction in the financial pressure related to employee
salaries, pensions and healthcare,” Moody’s said today in a
report. Its B2 rating on the city’s $14.7 million of general-
obligation debt remains five levels below investment grade.  During its 13 months under court protection, the city moved
from “pain to a sincere hope,” U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Bailey said last month at a court hearing in Providence, the
state capital. The Chapter 9 case was the quickest municipal-
debt adjustment for a city in U.S. history, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
