Green-job training programs paid for
by the 2009 economic stimulus have had only limited success in
boosting employment, the Department of Labor’s inspector general
said in a report.  The Labor Department watchdog examined 97 training programs
funded with $435.4 million in stimulus spending. Out of 113,247
people who participated, 52,890, or 47 percent, were already
employed when they entered the training program. The report
found that 30,857 of the participants were unemployed and later
found jobs or were employed and got new jobs after completing
training, short of the department’s 81,254 goal.  “The impact of the Recovery Act Green Jobs training
program has been limited in terms of reported employment
outcomes,” the inspector general said in the report, which is
dated October 25.  Representative  Darrell Issa  of  California , the Republican
chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee
who requested the report, said it shows the green-jobs training
program was a “bad investment.”  The report recommends that the Labor Department develop a
strategy to ensure grant funds are expended on those workers
most in need of the training.  Jane Oates, assistant secretary for employment and training
at the Labor Department, said in a response included in the
report that the grants were, “smart investments that are
preparing Americans for the clean energy jobs driving our 21st
century economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
