Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , the  money manager 
searching for a new chief executive officer, said fiscal second-
quarter profit increased 43 percent as gains from investments in
its own funds offset declining fees for managing client money.  Net income  in the three months ended Sept. 30 rose to $80.8
million, or 60 cents a share, from $56.7 million, or 39 cents, a
year earlier, the Baltimore-based firm said today in a
statement. Thirteen  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg expected
earnings averaging 53 cents a share. Net income was boosted by a
gain in non-operating income of $17.8 million related to
investments in its funds, compared with a loss of $51.1 million
a year earlier.  Legg Mason had net deposits into its products for the first
time in 20 quarters, driven by investors putting money in low-
fee money funds. Clients pulled $9.5 billion from stock and bond
funds. Joseph A. Sullivan, head of global distribution, is
serving as interim CEO while the board looks for a permanent
successor to  Mark Fetting , who stepped down Oct. 1 amid pressure
from activist investor  Nelson Peltz  to improve performance and
reverse redemptions.  “We remain focused on achieving consistent long-term
inflows to capitalize on the strong investment performance of
our key affiliates,” Sullivan said in the statement. “We will
continue to evolve our retail sales model to capture
opportunities that we see in the U.S. and internationally.”  Legg Mason rose 1.7 percent to $25.13 at 9:33 a.m. in New
York. The  stock  increased 2.7 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with the 18 percent gain in the S&P’s 20-
member index of custody banks and asset managers.  Revenue Falls  Revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 decreased 4.4
percent to $640.3 million and operating income declined 25
percent to $79.7 million as fees from Legg Mason’s higher-fee
funds declined.  Investors pulled $5.7 billion from stock funds and $3.8
billion from fixed-income funds during the quarter, while
depositing $9.7 billion into money funds. Net deposits were $200
million.  Legg Mason’s assets increased 3 percent during the quarter
and 6.4 percent during the past 12 months to $650.7 billion. Its
stock funds, which generally earn higher fees, rose 1.5 percent
to $153.4 billion. Bond fund assets, run mostly by Western Asset
Management Co., rose 2.4 percent to $369.4 billion and money
funds climbed 6.5 percent to $127.9 billion.  Industry Deposits  Industrywide, investors deposited $194.2 billion into
taxable bond funds while pulling $82.6 billion from U.S.-
registered domestic equity funds this year through September,
according to  data  compiled by  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  in  Chicago .  Legg Mason posted its first quarterly loss since the start
of 2009 in the three months ended June 30 because of costs to
refinance debt and expenses tied to opening two new investment
vehicles.  Fetting struggled to end client withdrawals and reverse a
65 percent decline in the company’s share price after he was
named CEO in 2008. His departure came before the end of a
standstill agreement with Peltz on Nov. 15. Since the 2009
investment in Legg Mason by Peltz, who is known for pushing
companies to increase their value by reducing costs or splitting
up, Fetting cut jobs, restructured expenses at investment units
and bought back shares.  Peltz said last year that he expected Western Asset to lead
the firm’s turnaround. The $10.1 billion Western Asset Core Plus
Bond Fund returned 7.9 percent this year through Oct. 24,
beating 86 percent of competing fixed-income funds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
