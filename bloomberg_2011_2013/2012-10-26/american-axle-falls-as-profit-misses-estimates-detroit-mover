American Axle & Manufacturing
Holdings Inc. (AXL)  tumbled the most in more than two years after the
maker of axles and crankshafts reported third-quarter earnings
that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  declined 10 percent to $10.38 at the close in
New York, the biggest drop since June 2010. The Detroit-based
company’s stock has gained 5 percent this year.  American Axle today reported profit of 7 cents a share
excluding costs of debt restructuring and plant closings. The
average of 14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg was for
earnings of 33 cents. The parts supplier posted a net loss of
$8.1 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with net income of
$24.8 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier.  Introduction of new products and “planned customer
downtime” on some existing programs “adversely affected” the
quarterly results, American Axle said in a statement. The
company had been owned by the predecessor of  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and has been trying to widen its customer base.  Revenue rose 8.5 percent to $702.9 million. American
Axle in a separate regulatory filing today projected 2012 full-
year sales of more than $2.9 billion. The average estimate is
$2.89 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
