Syncrude plunged to a discount to
West Texas Intermediate after  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) 
completed planned maintenance on the Horizon  upgrader  in  Alberta 
and restarted production.  The scheduled 12-day outage was completed on time and
workers have restarted feed into to the coker, the company said
in a statement today. Calgary-based Canadian Natural said its
synthetic crude production guidance remains on target for
between 90,000 and 98,000 barrels a day for this year.  Syncrude’s fell $4.75 to $4.50 a barrel below the U.S.
benchmark at 2:11 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Bakken, which competes with Syncrude as feedstock for
midwestern refineries, sank $2.50 to a discount of $3.50 a
barrel.  The discount for Western Canada Select, a heavy crude grade
from Alberta, narrowed $3 to $27 a barrel below WTI.  Southern Green Canyon and other U.S. Gulf of  Mexico  medium
crude oil grades rose on the  spot market  as Brent’s premium over
West Texas Intermediate increased for the fifth straight day,
increasing the cost of oil imports.  Brent, the benchmark crude for waterborne oil shipments,
 gained  83 cents against WTI to a premium of $23.27 a barrel at
1:55 p.m. New York time. Brent has gained $3.57 a barrel against
WTI over the last five days.  Gulf Coast  Southern Green Canyon gained 50 cents to $14.50 a barrel
against WTI at 2:11 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Mars Blend’s premium increased 30 cents to $15.65
a barrel. Poseidon gained 20 cents to $15.35 a barrel over WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana Sweet weakened
versus Brent as traders faced a deadline to schedule shipments,
according to  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC
in Houston.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet sank $1.60 to $20 a barrel above WTI,
while Light Louisiana Sweet lost $1.55 to trade at a premium of
$21.25 a barrel.  “The HLS and LLS are finishing up the scheduling on the
November barrel,” Lipow said. “So we have very little volume
going through,” which increases the volatility in trading, he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
