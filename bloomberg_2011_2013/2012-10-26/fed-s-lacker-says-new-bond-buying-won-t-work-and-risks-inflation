Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he opposed a decision by policy
makers this week to press on with additional bond buying because
the effort is ineffective and may speed up inflation.  “Further monetary stimulus now is unlikely to result in a
discernible improvement in growth, but if it does, it’s also
likely to cause an unwanted increase in inflation,” Lacker said
in a statement today. “Improvement in labor market conditions
appears to have been held back by real impediments that are
beyond the capacity of monetary policy to offset.”  The Richmond Fed chief was the only policy maker to cast a
dissenting vote at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Oct.
23-24 meeting, at which officials maintained $40 billion in
monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities and repeated
that  interest rates  are likely to stay near zero through
mid-2015. He has dissented from every FOMC decision this year.  Lacker said he “strongly opposed” additional purchases of
mortgage-backed securities because it’s inappropriate for the
Fed to tilt the flow of credit “to one particular economic
sector,” according to the statement released today by the
Richmond Fed.  Lacker, 57, has been president of his regional bank since
2004. He was previously the Richmond Fed’s director of research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
