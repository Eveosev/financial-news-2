Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. (1662) , the
country’s second-biggest oil and gas explorer, forecast its
first loss after slashing production estimates at a Hokkaido
field.  The company known as Japex expects an 11.6 billion yen
($146 million) loss for the year ending March 31, compared with
an earlier projection of a 16.5 billion yen profit.  Japex will book a 37 billion yen first-half charge for the
Yufutsu field on  Japan ’s northern island, it said today in a
statement. Natural gas production from the field will fall 40
percent next fiscal year, a spokesman said, declining to be
named citing company policy.  The Tokyo-based company reduced production capacity after
finding “the quantity of water brought forth with oil and gas
from the wells significantly exceeded its forecast,” according
to the statement. The company “has reached a conclusion that
the production capacity declined considerably.”  Japex shares dropped 2.2 percent to 3,340 yen today on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. The company announced the loss forecast
after the market closed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
