The European Union should act now to
strengthen the bloc’s emissions trading system and help prices
recover after they slumped amid a glut, according to the U.K.’s
Department of Energy and Climate Change.  Delaying the sales of 400 million to 1.2 billion allowances
under a strategy proposed by the EU regulator would boost carbon
prices at the beginning of the next emission market phase
starting in 2013 while lowering it at the later stage of the
trading period, DECC said in an  analysis  published on its
website.  “If allowances are canceled and permanently removed from
the market, there’s a sustained positive impact on carbon price
with a consistent rise in prices over all years up to 2020,”
DECC said.  The average price of permits in the next trading period in
the EU emissions trading system, which runs through 2020, may
rise by 4 to 24 euros a metric ton if the EU decided to cancel
from 400 million to 1.7 billion allowances, compared with
scenarios without permanent removal of allowances, according to
DECC estimates. Permanent removal of allowances would also
increase member states’ revenue from carbon auctions, DECC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
