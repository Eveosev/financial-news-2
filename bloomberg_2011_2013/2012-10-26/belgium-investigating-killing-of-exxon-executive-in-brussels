Belgian authorities are
investigating the killing of an  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  executive in
Brussels earlier this month.  Nicholas Mockford, a British national, was killed on Oct.
14 in the Belgian capital, Sophie Foale, a spokeswoman for the
company, said in an e-mailed statement. Mockford was a
department manager at Exxon’s office near Brussels, she said.  “We have no indication that the incident was work
related,” Foale said. Exxon is “shocked by the tragic death of
Nick Mockford.”  Mockford was shot  three times  after he was attacked by two
people when he left an Italian restaurant in the north of the
city and died on his way to the hospital, Belga newswire 
reported.  Genevieve Seressia, a spokeswoman for the Brussels
prosecutor’s office, declined to give details on the case,
citing instructions from the investigating judge, Martine
Quintin. She said investigators were calling for witnesses to
come forward.  “We hope that we will find the perpetrators,” Seressia
said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
