A pastel version of Edvard Munch’s
“The Scream” recently sold to an anonymous bidder for $120
million.  You can cast your eyes on this pricey iconic image, now on

“Melancholy,” as well as eight prints.  Runs through April 29 at MoMA, 11 W. 53rd St. Information:

starters, consider quail terrine with fennel-grapefruit salad,
and then try the saffron tagliatelle paired with a glass of
Alsace Riesling.  Information: +1-212-333-1220.  Saturday Matinee  The intimate Big Apple Circus has pitched its tent in
Damrosch Park -- no one is farther than 50 feet from the action.  This year’s show is “Legendarium,” filled with dancing
jugglers, hoop spinners, aerialists, contortionists and, of
course, clowns.  A highlight is the troupe of dogs rescued from animal
shelters and trained with bits of frankfurter.  Runs through Jan. 13 at  Lincoln Center . Information: +1-
212-268-2500;  http://bigapplecircus.org .  Saturday Night  Watch Prospero work his magic on the Metropolitan Opera
stage as the company presents the local premiere of Thomas
Ades’s “The Tempest.”  Here’s a change from the usual parade of operas by dead
people -- the vastly talented Ades is also on the podium.  The poetic Simon Keenlyside sings the role of Shakespeare’s
sorcerer. Audrey Luna flies and sings high as Ariel, who, like
her master, inhabits a lonely island (which suddenly comes alive
with all sorts of unexpected guests).  Runs through Nov. 17 at Lincoln Center. Information: +1-

celebration of PhantasmaGOREY 2012 presented by Dances of Vice
at Riverside Church.  Brian Carpenter’s Ghost Train Orchestra will play hot jazz
murder ballads at the Halloween Ball.  Performers include “Twilight Enchantress” Cassandra
Rosebeetle, Sequinette, aka “The Choleric Cello” and “True
Weimar Fraulein” MC Miss Astrid.  There is a strict dress code: Gashlycrumb Tinies, Hapless
Children and Lonesome Mourners are acceptable.  At 91 Claremont Ave. Information:  http://dancesofvice.com .  Sunday  Take a look at Richard Artschwager’s sculpture, paintings
and drawings at the Whitney retrospective.  He really liked Formica and Celotex.  Artschwager’s black ovular “blps,” his allusion to pixels
and Ben-Day dots, will be scattered around the High Line during
the Whitney show.  Runs through Feb. 3 at 945 Madison Ave. Information: =1-
212-570-3600;  http://whitney.org .  Grab a bite at Cafe Boulud: try the wild mushroom risotto

Christopher Durang’s “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike.”  Inspired by Chekhov, the play also stars David Hyde Pierce
as Vanya and Kristine Nielsen as his stepsister Sonia, who’ve
spent their lives in a Bucks County, Pennsylvania farmhouse
being decent.  Then Masha comes home, bringing along her 20-something
lover, Spike.  In previews at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln
Center, for a Nov. 12 opening. Information: +1-212-239-6200;

 http://lc.lincolncenter.org .  Sunday Night  Brit pop group the XX are on a North American tour in
support of their new album, “Coexist.”  The band knows how to delicately plumb the depths of angst,
and you may find your heart beating in a different way.  The XX are playing the restored Paradise Theatre in the
Bronx, built in 1929 and designed to look like a baroque
Mediterranean villa with stars twinkling overhead.  At 2403 Grand Concourse, the Bronx. Information: +1-718-
