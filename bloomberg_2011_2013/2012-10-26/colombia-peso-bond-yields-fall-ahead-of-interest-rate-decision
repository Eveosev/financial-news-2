Colombia ’s peso bond yields fell the
most in a week on speculation policy makers will lower borrowing
costs today to buoy growth in the Andean nation.  The yield on the 9.25 percent peso-denominated debt due in
May 2014 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
4.87 percent at 9:39 a.m. in Bogota, according to the central
bank. That’s the biggest decline since Oct. 19.  “The latest data on industrial output and vehicle sales
point to a decelerating economy,” said Daniel Escobar, the head
analyst at Global Securities brokerage in Bogota.  Seven analysts in a Bloomberg survey, including Escobar,
predict Banco de la Republica will cut the overnight lending
rate a quarter percentage point to 4.5 percent. Twenty-eight
expect the key rate will remain unchanged.  Rate decisions will depend on global growth and the
domestic economy, Colombia’s central bank said in minutes of its
Sept. 28 meeting that were published Oct. 12. Policy makers held
the target lending rate at 4.75 percent after two cuts since
June from 5.25 percent.  The peso dropped 0.1 percent to 1,819.69 per  U.S. dollar ,
paring its rally this year to 6.5 percent. The currency has
dropped 1.2 percent this week, the biggest decline since the
period ended Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
