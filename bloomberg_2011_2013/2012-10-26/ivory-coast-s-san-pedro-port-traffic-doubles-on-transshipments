Traffic of goods at Ivory Coast’s
second-biggest port, San Pedro, doubled by the end of September
to 2.4 million metric tons from a year earlier because of
increased transshipments, marketing director Guy Manoi said.  About 3.5 million tons of goods are expected to be handled
by the year’s end, almost double 2011’s 1.8 million tons, he
said yesterday in a telephone interview from San Pedro. The port
has an annual capacity of 5 million tons, he said.  “After a slow start of the cocoa season caused by the time
needed before everyone could adapt to the reforms, activity
should really take off by early November,” he said. “Stocks
with the new season’s beans are being readied for export.”
Transshipments already boost in traffic, he said.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest cocoa producer, is
recovering from a crisis that killed more than 3,000 people
after a disputed election in November 2010. Businesses halted
operations and cocoa and coffee exports largely stopped during
five months of fighting early in 2011.  Total exports amounted to 740,000 tons through September,
Manoi said. Cocoa exports declined 6 percent to 425,000 tons
from a year earlier, he said. San Pedro, the smaller of two
international ports in the West African nation, was built in the
western cocoa-producing region and handles shipments of the
chocolate ingredient.  To contact the reporter on this story:
