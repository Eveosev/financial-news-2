Asia Offshore Drilling Ltd. (AOD)  rose the
most in five months in Oslo trading after  Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)  said it
would seek to buy the owner of three jack up rigs.  Asia Offshore rose 17 percent, the most since May 16,
trading at 28.7 kroner as 1:07 p.m. in the Norwegian capital,
valuing the company at 1.1 billion kroner ($190 million).  Seadrill, the oil-rig company controlled by billionaire
 John Fredriksen , bought 12.19 million shares at $5 apiece,
raising its stake to 64.23 percent, according to a statement
today. The company will now make a mandatory cash offer for the
remaining shares, Seadrill said.  Asia Offshore said yesterday it won its first drilling
contract for one of its three rigs under construction. It sees
revenue of about $197 million for the three-year period starting
June 2013 as well as a $39.5 million mobilization fee, it said
in a statement yesterday. A jack-up rig has extendable legs that
allow it to stand on the ocean floor.  The price of Seadrillâ€™s share acquisition implies a yard
cost of $195 million to $200 million per rig, analysts at Pareto
Securities ASA wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. Asia
Offshore ordered its third rig for $184 million in July 2011,
the company said in a statement last year.  Seadrill is expanding its fleet as  oil companies  boost
offshore exploration spending. It bought a 34 percent stake in
Asia Offshore in July 2011 after a takeover of Scorpion Offshore
Ltd. in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
