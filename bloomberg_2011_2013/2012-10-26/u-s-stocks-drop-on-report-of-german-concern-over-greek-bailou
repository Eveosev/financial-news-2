U.S. stocks extended losses as
German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  reportedly said there
are doubts about whether Greece will be able to meet
requirements for its European bailout.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.5 percent after
fluctuating earlier following better-than-estimated U.S.
economic growth.  “Doubts persist as to whether Greece has been able to meet
its obligations,’’ Schaeuble said in an e-mail release of an
interview be broadcast Oct. 30 on ZDF television. These doubts
have to be dispelled from now on.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
