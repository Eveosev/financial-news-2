Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) ,  Mexico ’s second-
biggest homebuilder by sales, fell the most in four months after
third-quarter revenue and profit came below analysts’ estimates.  The shares plunged 4.9 percent to 16.55 pesos as of the
stock market’s close in Mexico City, the biggest drop since June
11. The benchmark  IPC index  of 35 Mexican companies declined 0.1
percent.  Revenue slipped to 4.5 billion pesos ($346 million) as home
sales by volume dropped 11 percent, the Mexico City-based
company said yesterday after the close in a stock exchange
filing. The average of nine estimates in a Bloomberg  survey 
called for third-quarter sales of 5.1 billion pesos. Adjusted
net income rose to 356.6 million pesos, below the 415.2 million
pesos average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “In contrast to previous reports, the volume of homes
titled by Geo showed a strong contraction, which was reflected
in the weak quarterly report,” Marco Medina, a Mexico City-
based analyst at Grupo Financiero Banco Ve Por Mas SA, wrote in
an e-mailed report today.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, a measure of profit known as Ebitda, fell 1.5
percent to 1.05 billion pesos, according to the homebuilder.  Geo said its main objective this year has been to cut debt
and generate free  cash flow  to equity. To meet that goal, it’s
targeting revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent for this
year.  Total debt was 13.5 billion pesos as of the end of
September, an 8.2 percent decrease from the previous quarter.
Net debt fell to 2.4 times Ebitda, from 2.6 at the end of the
second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
