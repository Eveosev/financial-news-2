CaixaBank SA (CABK) , Spain’s third-biggest
bank after it acquired Banca Civica, said profit slid 42 percent
as it pressed ahead with a task of cleaning up real estate
losses.  CaixaBank posted net  income  of 7 million euros ($9.1
million) in the third quarter compared with 12 million euros a
year earlier, the Barcelona-based lender said in a filing to
regulators today. Earnings  compared  with the 42.2 million-euro
average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.  Spanish banks, including CaixaBank, are under orders from
the government to speed up recognition of losses on real estate
assets that piled up on their books as the country’s property
bubble burst. CaixaBank said it made 4.41 billion euros of
provisions in the first nine months of the year to fully cover
the 2.44 billion-euro requirements of a property clean-up decree
from February and 600 million euros of the 2.1 billion euros in
charges it needs to make under another decree from May.  Net interest income jumped to 1.06 billion euros in the
third quarter from 777 million euros in the same period a year
ago.  The ratio of bad loans to total lending surged to 8.42
percent in September from 5.58 percent in June and 4.9 percent
in December, the lender said. Stripping out the impact of the
Civica acquisition, the bad loans ratio was 6.14 percent.  CaixaBank agreed to buy Civica, formed from a grouping of
former savings banks, in March for 977 million euros as an
overhaul of  Spain ’s financial system gathered pace. The
acquisition, completed in the third quarter, gives CaixaBank a
business with 344 billion euros in assets, 6,631 branches and 13
million clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
