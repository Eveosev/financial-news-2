“Cloud Atlas” director Tom Tykwer said every major film studio passed on financing his science-fiction epic.  Still, the “Run Lola Run” director and partners Lana and Andy Wachowski of “The Matrix” series managed to sign  Halle Berry , Susan Sarandon and  Tom Hanks  and raise $100 million. Opening today, “Cloud Atlas” ranks as one of the most expensive independent films ever. It’s expected to vie for top weekend sales with “Argo,” according to BoxOffice.com.  Based on the book by David Mitchell, “Cloud Atlas,” marks a resurgence for independent films -- movies not financed by major studios.  Hedge funds  and individuals who previously backed pictures vanished in the financial crisis, and studios like  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  closed or sold art-house units to focus on sequels and action films. Their retreat has given independent filmmakers a chance to snag well-known actors and open in more theaters.  “What are you going to do, only make movies that are guaranteed to work?” Hanks said at an Oct. 14 screening in  Los Angeles . “Well then we’re sitting here talking about ‘Forrest Gump 6,’ which is a lot better than ‘Forrest Gump 5.’ Who wants to do that for the rest of their lives?”  The six major studios released  141 movies  last year, a 31 percent decline since 2006, according to the  Motion Picture Association  of America, a Washington-based trade association. Independent producers turned out 469 in 2011, up 20 percent over the same period. The “Cloud Atlas” team signed  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner Bros. to distribute their film.  ‘Huge Opportunity’  “If you can be small and sleek and move around the elephants, it’s created a huge opportunity for these sort of smaller films to see the light of day,” said  David Ayer , writer and director of the recent police drama “End of Watch.”  Big studios are focusing on children’s films and action pictures that tend to be released in summer or around year-end holidays, according to Anthony Beaudoin, a Los Angeles-based senior vice president in film finance for Union Bank.  That creates a post-summer window for independent films and the studios’ own Oscar hopefuls.  “This is horror month,” Beaudoin said, citing the numerous low-budget, Halloween-timed productions.  Actor  Channing Tatum  and director Steven Soderbergh put up much of the cash to make the male stripper film “Magic Mike,” a June release estimated to cost $7 million by Box Office Mojo, an industry website. It grossed $159 million worldwide, revenue that was shared with cinema operators, and was released on home video on Oct. 23. Tatum plans a sequel.  Personal Bets  “They decided to bet on themselves,” said Glen Basner, founder of four-year-old independent distributor FilmNation Entertainment LLC, which sold the foreign rights. “That should be a great working model for other creative talents.”  Major studios often step in to distribute independent films, handling the cost of prints and marketing for a share of revenue that can include DVDs and television, said Basner, who handled international distribution for “Lawless,” “House at the End of the Street” and “Looper,” which all opened on more than 2,000 U.S. screens.  Warner Bros . bought the domestic rights to “Magic Mike” after the film was done shooting last year, Basner said.  “Cloud Atlas,” a story that follows characters being born and reborn over 500 years, is expected to collect $12.3 million in domestic weekend sales, according to BoxOffice.com. Rottentomatoes.com has a 62 percent favorable rating, based on critics’ reviews. Funding came from a long list of backers.  “A big group of people and completely diverse,” Tykwer said at the screening.  Cinema Backers  Open Road Films, which distributed “End of Watch” in the U.S., was created to address the major studio cutbacks. It’s owned by the two largest U.S. cinema chains,  Regal Entertainment Group (RGC)  and  AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC)   Ayer wrote the script in six days and raised enough money selling foreign rights to cover the $7.5 million cost.  Jake Gyllenhaal , the film’s star, agreed to work for less than what a major studio would pay, Tom Ortenberg, chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Open Road, said in an interview.  “Actors like Jake Gyllenhaal just love their craft,” Ortenberg said.  The film has grossed $38 million in U.S. theaters since its Sept. 21 release, according to Box Office Mojo. Television and DVD sales will add to that pot. Gyllenhaal, 31, is mentioned as an Academy Award contender for his role as a cop making a documentary about being a cop.  ‘Absolute Success’  “It’s absolutely been a success,” said Ayer, a writer and director whose credits include “Training Day” and “The Fast and the Furious.”  “End of Watch” was shot in South Los Angeles, largely with hand-held cameras that cost much less to operate than those at larger studios.  Ayer is presently shooting “Ten,” an independent film starring former California governor and action hero  Arnold Schwarzenegger  as the leader of a team of rogue Drug Enforcement Administration agents pulling off a heist.  “He’s excited by it,” Ayer said. “This is a chance for him to step out of the creative space he’s known for and rebrand himself.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles at  cpalmeri1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Anthony Palazzo at  apalazzo@bloomberg.net
