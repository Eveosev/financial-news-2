Crude oil options volatility eased
as underlying futures were little changed, paring a second
straight weekly decline.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
December, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 29.64 percent on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 4:15 p.m., down from 29.99 percent
yesterday.  “It’s quiet,” said Jim Colburn, a vice president and
energy options broker at Jefferies Bache LLC in New York.
“We’re waiting for the next move. Will it continue down or find
a little bit of support here?”  December-delivery crude oil rose 23 cents to settle at
$86.28 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices fell 4.2 percent this week.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $135 calls, which were unchanged at 1 cent on volume of
4,543 lots. December $130 calls were the second-most active,
with 3,976 lots exchanged as they were unchanged at 2 cents a
barrel.  Calls accounted for 64 percent of the 41,386 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, calls made up 58 percent of the
125,063 contracts traded.  December $135 calls were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 5,877 contracts. They were unchanged at 1 cent a
barrel. January $70 puts fell 7 cents to 29 cents on volume of
5,795 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
68,125 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 46,566 lots
