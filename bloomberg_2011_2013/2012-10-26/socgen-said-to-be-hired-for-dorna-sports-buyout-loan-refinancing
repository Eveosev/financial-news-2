Bridgepoint and  Canada Pension Plan 
Investment Board hired  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  to lead banks
arranging about 485 million euros ($625 million) of loans to
refinance debt of  Dorna Sports S.L. , according to two people
with knowledge of the matter.  Bank of Ireland, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and ING Groep NV,
existing lenders to the Madrid-based sports management company,
are also arranging the loan, said the people, who asked not to
be identified because the deal is private. Lenders will be
invited to a meeting in  Madrid  on about Nov. 6, they said.  The financing comes after Canada Pension Plan acquired a 39
percent stake in the Madrid-based company, holder of rights to
the MotoGP motorbike racing series and FIM World Superbikes
Championship. Bridgepoint bought the business in 2006 from  CVC
Capital Partners .  James Murray, a spokesman in London for Bridgepoint,
declined to comment on the debt financing.  The financing includes senior and junior-ranking debt and
will represent about six times the companyâ€™s forecast 2012
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
80 million euros, said the people. Part of the deal includes 85
million euros of debt from Goldman Sachs to fund repayment of
shareholder loans, said the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
