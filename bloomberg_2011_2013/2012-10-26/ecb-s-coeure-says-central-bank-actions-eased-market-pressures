European Central Bank Executive
Board member Benoit Coeure said actions by the world’s biggest
central banks have reduced pressures in financial markets.  Policy interventions by the ECB, the  Federal Reserve System 
and other central banks “have certainly eased financial market
pressures,” Coeure said today in Paris, according to a speech
published on the ECB’s website. “Although we are still
grappling with tensions in credit and sovereign debt markets,
and with the painful adjustment of our economies, the financial
system is recovering.”  With the sovereign debt crisis entering its fourth year and
at least five of 17 euro-area countries in recession, the ECB in
August unveiled a plan to buy  government bonds  to quash
speculation of a euro breakup.  Germany ’s Bundesbank opposes the
program, saying it is tantamount to financing governments.  Referring to economic models prior to the crisis, Coeure
said they “proved to be relatively inadequate to deal with the
complexity of the crisis.” It is also true that our models
“did not predict the crisis and provided only limited policy
guidance,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
