Sri Lanka’s capital is being
provided $300 million in Asian Development Bank loans for water
and sewage system upgrades as parts of  Colombo  have a water-
supply distribution network that’s more than a century old.  The assistance was approved by ADB’s board to back a $400
million government investment program to improve water and
sanitation across metropolitan Colombo, prevent sewer blockages
and reduce water leaks and losses, the bank said.  The ADB has extended funds for water supply and sanitation
works in Sri Lanka since 1986. This assistance is to fund new
sewage connections, construct two wastewater treatment plants
and seeks 100 percent sewer network coverage in Colombo by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
