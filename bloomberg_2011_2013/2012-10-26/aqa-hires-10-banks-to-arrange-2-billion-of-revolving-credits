Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. (TAQA) , the
state-controlled power and oil producer known as Taqa, hired 10
banks led by Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. to arrange $2
billion of credit lines to refinance a loan maturing in 2013.  The deal will be divided between three- and five-year
multicurrency portions and replaces a $2 billion piece of a
credit pact maturing in December 2013, according to an e-mailed
statement from the lenders.  Bank of America Corp., BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc., HSBC
Holdings Plc,  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD) , Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, Societe Generale SA, Standard Chartered Bank
and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. are also participating
as bookrunners, according to the statement. The borrower will
hold presentations in Abu Dhabi,  London  and Hong Kong next week.  Taqa signed $3 billion of credit lines in 2010 that paid
interest at 100 basis points to 130 basis points more than
benchmark rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
