Norway proposed a formal law to
strengthen the capital backing its depositor guarantee fund by
setting an annual fee for banks.  “It’s important for banks to contribute capital to the
guarantee fund every year so the fund can grow and improve its
ability to handle crises in larger individual banks or problems
affecting several banks simultaneously,” Finance Minister
Sigbjoern Johnsen said in an e-mailed statement today.  The measure was first announced in May. The fund’s capital
needs to be 1.5 percent of all deposits at member banks and 0.5
percent of the amount used to calculate  capital requirements ,
the ministry said. The banks’ fee would be set at 0.001 percent
of deposits and 0.0005 percent of the capital requirement
amount. No fee will be charged in the years when the fund
exceeds the minimum amount.  Capital in the fund stood at 22.7 billion kroner at the end
of last year. Norway guarantees  bank deposits  as high as 2
million kroner per account.  To contact the reporter on this story:
