Gasoline strengthened in the New
York Harbor market on speculation Delaware,  New Jersey  and
Pennsylvania refineries will shut as Hurricane Sandy approaches
the region.  Five East Coast plants, with a combined capacity of about
1.15 million barrels a day, may be affected by the storm,
according to Andy Lipow, president of energy consultant Lipow
Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The refineries include Philadelphia Energy Solutions’
Philadelphia;  PBF Energy Inc. (PBF) ’s Paulsboro, New Jersey and
Delaware City, Delaware; Monro Energy LLC’s Trainer,
Pennsylvania, and  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Linden, New Jersey plants.  Sandy, a  Category 1  storm with winds of 75 miles (121
kilometers) an hour at 2 p.m., was 430 miles south-southeast of
Charleston, South Carolina, moving north at 7 mph. It may
shutter plants for five to seven days due to pre-storm closures
and power outages,  Roger Read , an energy analyst with Wells
Fargo & Co. in Houston, said today in a note to investors.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol gained
0.25 cent to trade at a  premium  of 2 cents a barrel over futures
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:57 p.m. in New York.
 Prompt delivery  increased by 2.52 cents to $2.7191 a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
