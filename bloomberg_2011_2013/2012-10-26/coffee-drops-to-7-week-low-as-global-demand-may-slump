Coffee futures tumbled to a seven-
week low on concern that slowing economies will erode demand
prospects amid ample supplies. Sugar and cocoa also slid.  In the third quarter,  South Korea ’s economy grew at the
slowest pace in three years, while  Spain ’s unemployment climbed
to a record, separate reports showed today. Coffee exports from
 Brazil , the world’s top grower, may rise 23 percent in October
from a month earlier, Rio de Janeiro-based broker Flavour Coffee
said in a report.  “The macroeconomic environment can only be negative for
this market, not constructive,” Joe Scaduto, the president of
JPS Commodities LLC, a broker in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “The rains Brazil has been getting can only help
next year’s harvest, and they are still holding more than half
of this year’s crop.”  Arabica coffee for December delivery slumped 2 percent to
settle at $1.5775 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after touching $1.569, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Sept. 6.  This week, the price fell 2.4 percent, the fourth straight
decline and the longest slide since mid-June. The commodity has
plunged 30 percent in 2012, the most within the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index.  Raw-sugar futures for March delivery declined 0.9 percent
to 19.35 cents a pound on ICE, extending this week’s drop to 4.3
percent.  Cocoa futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$2,383 a metric ton. This week, the price sank 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
