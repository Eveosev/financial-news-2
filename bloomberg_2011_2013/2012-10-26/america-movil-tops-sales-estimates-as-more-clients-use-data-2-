America Movil SAB (AMXL) , the biggest
mobile-phone carrier in the Americas by subscribers, beat
expectations for third-quarter sales as customers spent more on
data services such as music downloads and Web browsing.  Revenue rose 4.5 percent to 192.8 billion pesos ($14.8
billion), beating the 188 billion-peso average of eight
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income rose to
30.6 billion pesos, or 40 centavos a share, from 18.3 billion
pesos, or 36 centavos, a year earlier, aided by currency gains.  America Movil , controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , is
pushing for more data customers to boost revenue per user as
prices fall for traditional voice service on mobile phones. In
 Mexico , its largest market, the average user paid 179 pesos a
month, up 9.6 percent from a year earlier.  “Mexico put up good numbers once again,” said  Chris King ,
an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, Maryland.
“The economy’s held up there in the face of a soft  U.S.
economy , so the market as a whole is doing OK.” He has a hold
rating on the shares.  Still, the company added fewer wireless subscribers than
King expected. Its user base grew by 4.1 million to 255.9
million, short of the 4.5 million additions he had projected.  America Movil rose 0.6 percent to 16.70 pesos at the close
in Mexico City. The shares have gained 5.6 percent this year.  The company recorded a foreign-exchange gain of 9.02
billion pesos, compared with a loss of 23.4 billion pesos a year
ago. Leaving out that gain and other items, profit was 66.2
billion pesos, up 0.6 percent from last year, and margins fell
to 34.4 percent from 35.7 percent.  TV Growth  America Movil’s fastest-growing business continued to be
pay  television , which it offers through cable and satellite
units in countries including  Brazil  and Colombia. Video
customers surged 26 percent to 15.8 million, helping America
Movil retain its title as the largest pay-TV provider in  Latin
America .  Brazil, America Movil’s second-biggest market behind
Mexico, continued to be a drag on results. The division’s profit
margin slid to 24.1 percent from 25.1 percent a year ago.
Monthly bills fell 16 percent even as voice traffic rose 14
percent, suggesting customers are paying less even as they use
their phones more.  “Brazil’s still a train wreck,” said King of Stifel
Nicolaus. “Until that gets better, it’s hard to see the stock
really working well.”  In Mexico, where America Movil has 70 percent of mobile-
phone subscribers, voice traffic surged 22 percent from a year
earlier. The average price per minute fell 18 percent because of
fee cuts mandated by regulators.  Telmex (TELMEXL) , America Movil’s land-line unit in Mexico, continued
to struggle to keep customers from switching to mobile providers
or competitors such as cable companies. Its phone lines declined
by 4.5 percent from a year earlier.  (America Movil will hold a conference call at 10 a.m.  New
York  time to discuss the quarterly results. To listen, dial
