Japan  stocks  fell, with the Nikkei
225 Stock Average paring a three-month advance, after the yen
strengthened from a four-month low and companies including Canon
Inc. and  Fanuc Corp. (6954)  reported disappointing earnings.  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, fell 3.2 percent
after cutting its profit forecast as consumers switch to
smartphones for taking pictures. Fanuc, the world’s leading
producer of factory robotics, slid 3.1 percent after posting
first-half earnings that missed its projections. Sharp Corp.,
Japan’s largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, gained 3.8
percent on a report the loss-making company is seeking
investment from U.S. technology firms.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.4 percent to 8,933.06 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , falling 0.8 percent on the week and heading for
a 0.7 percent monthly gain. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index lost 1.4
percent to 741.23, with more than twice as many shares declining
as advancing. The nation’s central bank will open a policy
meeting on Oct. 30.  “Expectations for Bank of Japan stimulus have peaked,”
said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and strategist at Tachibana
Securities in Tokyo. “Some investors are selling shares to lock
in profit at the end of the week. Japanese earnings haven’t been
as good as expected, and the forecasts are severe due to the
sluggish global economy.”  The Topix has risen 3.1 percent since Sept. 6 after the
European Central Bank started a global wave of easing to boost
growth, with the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan
following suit. Shares on the stock gauge traded at 0.9 times
book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.5 for the  Europe  Stoxx 600 Index.  Stimulus Measures  Japan ’s government today announced 750 billion yen ($9.4
billion) of stimulus to shore up growth. The Bank of Japan is
expected to take easing steps next week after the nation’s
consumer prices fell a fifth straight month, adding pressure for
measures to end deflation and revive the economy. A Bloomberg
survey indicated the central bank is expected to expand an
asset-purchase program by 10 trillion yen.  The Japanese currency strengthened against all of its major
counterparts as corporate earnings concerns dragged down stocks,
boosting demand for haven assets. The yen rose to 80.08 against
the dollar at the close of stock trading today after falling as
low as 80.38, the weakest since June 25.  Of the Topix-listed companies that have reported earnings
since the beginning of October and for which estimates are
available, 55 percent have missed expectations. Earnings season
peaks next week, with 571 of 1,672 Topix companies reporting.  Canon Earnings  Canon (7751)  fell 3.2 percent to 2,560 yen after cutting its net-
income projection for this year by 6.4 percent to 234 billion
yen. It also lowered its sales estimate for compact cameras by
9.5 percent and for professional models by 4.3 percent.  Fanuc sank 3.1 percent to 12,570 yen after net income fell
9.8 percent to 67 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30,
missing its forecast by 11 percent, as slower demand for goods
in Europe dented production and deterred manufacturers from
investing in new equipment. Fanuc also said full-year profit may
drop 2 percent to 136 billion yen.  Yamaha Corp. (7951)  declined the most on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , falling 8
percent to 717 yen. The maker of musical instruments fell after
issuing a preliminary earnings statement that showed net income
totaled 3.3 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30,
missing its forecast by 45 percent, citing lower-than-expected
sales.  Sharp Investment  Sharp led gains on the Nikkei 225. The stock climbed 3.8
percent to 166 yen after Asahi newspaper reported Sharp is
seeking investments from Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp.,
Microsoft Corp., Google Inc. and Apple Inc. The Japanese company
is seeking partners after negotiations with Foxconn Technology
Group over a stake sale stalled.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.7 percent
today. The gauge gained 0.3 percent yesterday in New York amid
better-than-estimated corporate earnings. U.S. jobless claims
fell last week, showing some progress in the labor market.
Americans signed fewer contracts than forecast in September to
purchase previously owned homes, a sign the industry’s recovery
will be uneven, report showed yesterday.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  jumped 4.8
percent to 20.49, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.9
percent on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
