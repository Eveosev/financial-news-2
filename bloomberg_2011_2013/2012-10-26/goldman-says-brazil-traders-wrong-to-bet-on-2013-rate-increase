Brazilian swaps traders are
overestimating how soon the central bank will reverse course and
raise borrowing costs from a record low, said Paulo Leme, the
chief of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s offices in the country.  Policy makers are likely to keep the benchmark rate at 7.25
percent through the end of 2013, Leme said in a speech today at
a Brazilian pension fund conference in  Sao Paulo . Traders are
betting the central bank will raise the rate, know as Selic, by
75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, next year, starting
with a 25 basis-point increase as soon as May, swap rates show.  “I’m more dovish,” Leme said.  Brazil  cut the target lending rate for a 10th straight
meeting on Oct. 10, bringing it down from 12.5 percent in August
2011, to revive the slowest growth among major emerging-market
economies. Keeping  interest rates  stable for a “sufficiently
prolonged” period is the best strategy to ensure inflation
converges to the country’s 4.5 percent, the central bank said in
the minutes of its Oct. 9-10 meeting.  Developed nations face a “long and painful” deleveraging
process that will weigh on global growth and provide room for
Brazil to keep rates at record lows, Leme said.  Brazilian pension funds seeking higher returns in coming
years will abandon lower-yielding government debt in favor of
alternative investments in industries including infrastructure,
real estate and private equity, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
