U.K. government bonds advanced after
data showed Spanish unemployment climbed to a record, with one
in every four workers out of a job in the third quarter,
boosting demand for the safest assets.  The  extra yield  investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds widened to the most in
four months on speculation the Bank of England will refrain from
expanding bond-purchase stimulus after U.K. growth data
yesterday beat economist forecasts. The pound gained versus all
of but two its 16 major counterparts in the week.  “The bigger picture for gilts is that the euro-region
crisis is ongoing,” said Simon Peck, a London-based interest-
rate strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “We’ve
seen a rally in core fixed-income, with gilt yields going lower.
At the moment on the domestic side there’s a shifting momentum
away from bond purchases and that’s causing gilts to
underperform bunds.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.87 percent at 4:49 p.m.  London  time.
The 1.75 percent security maturing in September 2022 rose 0.44,
or 4.40 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,612) face amount, to 98.97.
Ten-year gilt yields were two basis points lower over the week.  Spain’s unemployment rose to 25.02 percent from 24.6
percent in the previous quarter, a report showed today. That is
the highest since at least 1976, the year after dictator
Francisco Franco’s death led Spain to democracy.  Yield Spread  The yield difference, or spread, between 10-year gilts and
the rate on similar-maturity German bunds was little changed at
33 basis points, the widest since June, according to closing-
price data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.K. gross domestic product expanded 1 percent in the three
months through September from the previous period, the fastest
growth since 2007, the Office for National Statistics said
yesterday. That exceeded the highest estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey for a 0.8 percent increase.  The pound was little changed at $1.6098, having gained 0.6
percent since Oct. 19, the first weekly advance since the five
days ended Sept. 21. Sterling slid 0.1 percent to 80.34 pence
per euro after touching 80.02 pence, the strongest since Oct. 3.  “The GDP data helped my view that the Bank of England
won’t ease again in November,” said  Steven Barrow , head of
Group of 10 research at Standard Bank Plc in London. “What
happens to the U.K. economy won’t be as bad as the euro-region
economy and the pound will continue to strengthen against the
euro.”  Sterling will probably appreciate to 75 pence per euro
within six months, Barrow said. The currency last traded at 75
pence in February 2008.  The pound has risen 0.2 percent in the past three months
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The euro gained 3.1 percent and
the dollar dropped 2.6 percent.  Gilts have returned 1.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 2.5 percent and Treasuries earned 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
