Mark Mahaney , a top technology
analyst at  Citigroup Inc. (C) , was fired, according to a person
briefed on the matter.  The termination wasn’t related to Massachusetts’ claim that
Citigroup failed to supervise a junior analyst who allegedly
disclosed confidential information during Facebook Inc.’s
initial public offering, said the person, who requested
anonymity because the decision is private. The New York-based
bank agreed to pay a $2 million fine to settle that case.  Mahaney declined to comment when reached on mobile phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
