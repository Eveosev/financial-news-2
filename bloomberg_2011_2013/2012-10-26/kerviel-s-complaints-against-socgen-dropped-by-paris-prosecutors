Two complaints filed by  Jerome
Kerviel , the trader convicted of being responsible for a 4.9
billion-euro trading loss, against  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  have been
dropped by Paris prosecutors, a spokeswoman for their office
said.  The complaints accused the bank of deceiving a court about
how much money it ultimately lost in unwinding Kerviel’s
unauthorized positions and doctoring recordings of him with bank
officials prior to his 2008 arrest.  Kerviel filed the complaints before the June hearings on
his unsuccessful bid to overturn a guilty verdict holding him
accountable for the loss. The Paris appeals court upheld the
2010 decision, as well as the sentence of three years in jail
and an order to repay Societe Generale.  Societe Generale filed slander complaints in retaliation.
Those are still active, according to the spokeswoman, Agnes
Thibault-Lecuivre. The decision to drop the complaints was
previously reported by Agence France-Presse.  Kerviel has appealed the Oct. 24 decision to the Cour de
Cassation, allowing him to remain free in the meantime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
