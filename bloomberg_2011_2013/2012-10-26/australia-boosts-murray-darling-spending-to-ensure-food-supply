Australia will spend an extra A$1.8
billion ($1.9 billion) to boost the amount of water returned to
the Murray-Darling Basin as it seeks to ensure sustainable  food
production  in the world’s second-biggest wheat exporter.  The funds will be provided over 10 years from 2014 to
return an extra 450 gigaliters of water to the system, through
measures including removing low-lying bridges and undersized dam
outlets, Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  said in a statement today.
That will take the total amount of water returned to the basin
to 3,200 gigaliters, the government said.  The Murray-Darling  Basin , which extends from southern
Queensland to  South Australia , covers 14 percent of Australia’s
land and produces more than one-third of the nation’s food
including wheat and dairy. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority
was set up in 2008 to create a plan to manage water in an area
where some river beds run dry in years of drought.  The additional water will “help ensure the system never
again goes into a period of drought lacking the resilience it
needs to survive,” the statement said.  Water  storages  in the Murray-Darling Basin were 97 percent
full as of Oct. 24, data on the basin management authority’s
website showed. Australia is the driest  inhabited  continent,
according to the Bureau of Meteorology.  To contact the reporter for this story:
