AG&P , an engineering services
company based in the  Philippines , said it won a $152 million
contract to provide the “electrical backbone” of the Inpex
Corp.-led Ichthys liquefied natural gas project in  Australia .  AG&P will build components for Ichthys at its yards south
of  Manila , using steel from Melbourne-based  BlueScope Steel
Ltd. (BSL) , and ship the modules to the project site in northern
Australia, AG&P Chairman Joseph Sigelman said in an interview.
AG&P equipment will enable the LNG project to control power
distribution and monitor the progress of the development.  AG&P, which has won about $750 million in contracts since
2011, is seeking more Australian LNG business, Sigelman said
yesterday in Sydney. Many of the resources developments in
Australia are economically viable only with modular
construction, in which the units are shipped to project sites.  “It’s important to think about ways to make these projects
more cost competitive,” according to Sigelman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
