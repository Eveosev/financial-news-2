Casinos in  New Jersey , Connecticut,
New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland face a risk of closing and
damage because of Hurricane Sandy, Wells Fargo Securities said.  Cameron McKnight, a Wells Fargo analyst, said that among
casinos of companies he follows,  Boyd Gaming Corp. (BYD) ’s Borgata in
Atlantic City, New Jersey; Penn National Gaming Inc.’s Hollywood
Perryville, Maryland, property; and the Sands Bethlehem in
Pennsylvania run by  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS)  may close and suffer
property damage or loss of business from the storm.  Equipment suppliers such as  International Game Technology (IGT) ,
 Bally Technologies Inc. (BYI)  and WMS Industries Inc. also may be
affected by damage or loss of play at casinos in the path of the
storm, the New York-based analyst said. Connecticut tribal
casinos also are threatened, he said in a note yesterday.  Forecasters warn of a superstorm, dubbed “Frankenstorm”
by the  National Weather Service , that will grow out of Hurricane
Sandy and two other storms rushing eastward across the U.S. The
 track  for Sandy yesterday had it going ashore just south of the
Delaware Bay late Oct. 29 or early Oct. 30 and moving northwest
between Baltimore and Wilmington, Delaware, the National
Hurricane Center said.  Las Vegas Sands, based in Las Vegas, said in a statement
yesterday that it isn’t currently planning to close the
Pennsylvania property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
