Hurricane Sandy may boost demand for
tankers hauling refined fuels if imports have to replace output
from New Jersey and Pennsylvania refineries that could be
disrupted by the storm, according to RS Platou Markets AS.  Sandy may combine with a second storm coming out of the
Midwest to create a system that would rival the New England
Hurricane of 1938 in intensity, said Paul Kocin, a National
Weather Service meteorologist in College Park,  Maryland . The
hurricane currently passing the Bahamas has killed 21 people
across the Caribbean, the Associated Press reported, citing
local officials.  “If it hits New Jersey and Pennsylvania refineries may
reduce or shut down production, meaning more imports should
support product-tanker demand,” Herman Hildan, an analyst at
Platou in Oslo, said by phone today. “It would be just a
temporary thing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
