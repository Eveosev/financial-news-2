Xylem Inc. (XYL) , the water technology
company that was spun off last year from ITT Corp., acquired
privately held Heartland Pump Rental for about $29 million to
expand in the dewatering business.  Dewatering is “a strategic growth market for us, building
on our existing capabilities in emergency water removal, bypass,
drainage and industrial applications,” Xylem Chief Executive
Officer Gretchen McClain said in a statement.  Xylem’s dewatering solutions business involves designing
and manufacturing automatic self-priming pumps and submersible
electric pumps. Heartland Pump is based in Carterville,
Illinois, with branches in Indiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.  Xylem is based in  White Plains , New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
