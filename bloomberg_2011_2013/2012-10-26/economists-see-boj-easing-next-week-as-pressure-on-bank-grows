The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will probably take
new easing steps next week, a survey of economists showed, as
pressure builds on the central bank to do more to end deflation
and revive the economy.  All but one of 27 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
expect the central bank to add to stimulus for the second time
in two months at a policy board meeting on Oct. 30. At its last
meeting that ended Oct. 5, the bank held off from more easing
after expanding its asset-purchase program in September.  Price falls have  continued  since May and the BOJ will
probably predict it will miss its 1 percent inflation goal in
the next two fiscal years, according to people familiar with the
matter. That comes as slowing overseas demand and the strong yen
weigh on exporters, with Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley
predicting that the economy will shrink in the third and fourth
quarters of 2012.  “The risk of recession is rising,” said Yasunari Ueno,
chief market economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “I
think the bank will expand its asset purchase funds by 15
trillion yen but it will depend on developments in  currency
markets  and the global economy right before the meeting.”  Fifteen analysts expect the BOJ to add 10 trillion yen to
its asset-purchase funds, while four economists see it adding as
much as 20 trillion yen.  Expand Asset Program:  Economist                                Expansion  Jun Ishii                                  Y10T
