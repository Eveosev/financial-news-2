The  Federal Reserve  will delay by
five months the implementation of its program to simplify the
administration of reserve requirements.  The central bank issued a final rule in April to “reduce
administrative and operational costs for depository
institutions,” the Fed said in a statement today in Washington.
“The project does not affect the stance of monetary policy.”  The second phase of amendments to the requirements was
scheduled to take effect in January of next year. It will now be
delayed until June 27.  “The delay will allow for further development and testing
of automated systems to ensure a smooth transition for affected
institutions,” the Fed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
