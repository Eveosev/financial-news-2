Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the
largest U.S. tiremaker, fell the most in more than 14 months
after reporting a third-quarter profit that was below analysts’
estimates, hurt by lower sales in  Europe .  Goodyear dropped 10 percent to $11.02 at the close in  New
York , the biggest drop since Aug. 18, 2011. The shares have slid
22 percent this year after advancing 20 percent in 2011.  The company posted a quarterly adjusted profit of 53 cents
a share. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a profit of 59 cents. The results excluded
one-time items, such as accelerated depreciation and pension
settlements in the U.K.  Sales fell 13 percent to $5.26 billion in the  quarter . The
average of four analysts’ estimates was $5.87 billion. Tires
sold during the quarter slid 12 percent to 41.8 million,
Goodyear said. Tires sold in Goodyear’s Europe,  Middle East  and
Africa unit decreased 21 percent to 16.3 million and the unit’s
operating margin narrowed to 6 percent of sales from 11.7
percent.  Goodyear’s net income fell to $117 million compared with
$168 million, the Akron, Ohio-based company said today.  The company’s tire sales this quarter will be 3 percent to
5 percent lower than in 2011, Goodyear said in the statement.
For the year, Goodyear said consumer replacement-tire sales will
fall 2 percent to 3 percent in  North America , where tires for
new cars and light trucks will rise 8 percent to 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
