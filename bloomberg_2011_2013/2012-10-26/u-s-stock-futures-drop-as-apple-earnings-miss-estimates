Most U.S. stocks retreated, driving the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a weekly decline, as investors watched economic and corporate earnings reports.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., the largest U.S. tiremaker, dropped 10 percent after reporting a profit that was below estimates.  VeriSign Inc. (VRSN) , an operator of Web domain name registries, tumbled 15 percent after saying regulators have delayed a review of the company’s contract for that business. Expedia Inc. surged 15 percent as the online travel agency reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  Eight stocks declined for every five that advanced on U.S. exchanges at 4 p.m. New York time.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 3.53 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 13,107.21. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was about 5.8 billion shares, or 2.3 percent below the three-month average.  “You’re getting a mix of data that don’t have a clear direction,” said  Stephen Wood , the New York-based chief market strategist for  North America  for Russell Investments, which oversees $152 billion. “It’s important for investors’ psychology to see GDP data beating estimates. Yet the earnings season has been a very challenging one.”  The benchmark gauge for American equities is poised to snap a four-month rally amid concern about corporate profits. The S&P 500 has slumped 2 percent so far in October. Third-quarter earnings at 71 percent of the index’s companies beat estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales  missed  forecasts at 59 percent of companies, the data showed.  Economic Data  The economy in the U.S. expanded more than forecast in the third quarter, paced by a pickup in consumer spending, a rebound in government outlays and gains in residential construction. Separately, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index consumer sentiment for October increased to 82.6 from 78.3 the prior month. Economists projected 83 for the gauge after a preliminary October reading of 83.1, according to the median forecast of 60 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Concern about a worsening of Europe’s debt crisis grew after German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said there are doubts on whether Greece will meet requirements for its European bailout, according to an e-mail release of an interview to be broadcast Oct. 30 on ZDF television.  “There’s still concern about Europe,” said Thomas Garcia, head of equity trading at Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg Investment Management Inc. His firm oversees about $80 billion. “You have Greek debt crisis, problems in Spain and other areas. The market is going to be back and forth until those guys get things figured out over there.”  Goodyear’s Results   Goodyear (GT)  dropped 10 percent to $11.02. The company posted a quarterly adjusted profit of 53 cents a share. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 59 cents.

The company, which operates the registry for .com names, submitted the agreement to provide that service to the U.S. Commerce Department on June 26 and anticipated an approval by Nov. 30, according to a statement yesterday.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  jumped 6.9 percent to $238.24 after posting a smaller operating loss than analysts had anticipated as the world’s largest online retailer ramped up spending on delivery services ahead of the holiday sales season.  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  added 3.3 percent to $37.56. The largest U.S. cable company and the majority owner of NBC said third-quarter profit more than doubled, boosted by advertising revenue, the sale of assets and a decrease in the loss of subscribers.

The fourth- largest U.S. producer of the fuel reported third-quarter results that exceeded analysts’ estimates after shipments increased more than projected and costs declined.  Moody’s Corp.

The  Bloomberg Global Aggregate Hedge Fund Index (BBHFUNDS)  gained 3.1 percent through September, compared with a 16 percent increase in the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index and a 4.5 percent advance in the Barclays Capital Bond Composite U.S. Index.  Hedge funds that wager on rising and falling stocks are 22 percent net long, below the average of 35 percent to 40 percent, according to an Oct. 22 report published by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. A net position is the difference between bets on rising stocks and falling stocks.
