Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , the largest U.S.
cable company and the majority owner of NBC, said third-quarter
profit more than doubled, boosted by advertising revenue, the
sale of assets and fewer subscriber losses.  Net income climbed to $2.11 billion, or 78 cents a share,
from $908 million, or 33 cents, a year earlier, the company said
today in a statement. Excluding some one-time gains, profit was
46 cents a share, in line with the average analyst estimate
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 15 percent to $16.5 billion,
beating the average estimate of $16.1 billion.  Comcast has upgraded its video services and broadband
speeds and produced ratings gains at the once-struggling NBC,
which drew more viewers age 18 to 49 in the first few weeks of
the new season. A revival of the network would help Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts capitalize on his $13.8
billion gamble on NBC Universal.  “Their operations are solid,” said Todd Mitchell, an
analyst at Brean Capital LLC in New York who recommends buying
the shares.  Comcast’s stock rose 3.3 percent to $37.56 in New York at
the close, the biggest one-day gain in more than eight months.
Shares of the Philadelphia-based company have climbed 58 percent
this year.  Olympic Advertising  NBC’s rights to televise the London Olympics in the U.S.
helped the broadcaster double its ad revenue in the quarter to
almost $2 billion. Comcast also is benefiting from the sale of
assets, such as a stake in A&E Networks that it agreed to sell
for $3.03 billion. That deal added 12 cents a share to earnings
in the quarter, Comcast said.  A sale of wireless spectrum to Verizon Wireless generated
20 cents a share in the period. In that transaction, Verizon
agreed to pay $3.6 billion for airwaves from a group of cable
companies led by Comcast. The deal won government clearance in
August.  Comcast repurchased $750 million of its own shares in the
quarter and paid out $435 million in dividends.  The company lost 117,000 video subscribers in the period,
less than the 165,000 that left the cable company a year
earlier. Analysts had estimated a loss of about 124,000 on
average. Comcast also added 287,000 broadband customers and
123,000 phone customers. Analysts had projected a gain of
264,000 Internet subscribers and 120,000 phone customers.  Online Video  While Comcast has stemmed losses in cable-TV subscribers,
the emergence of streaming Internet video also is an important
opportunity for the company, NBC Universal CEO Stephen Burke
said on an conference call with analysts. Comcast will look for
new ways to make money from those kinds of services, he said.  “It’s clearly something you need to pay attention to,”
Burke said.  Revenue at NBC Universal rose 31 percent to $6.82 billion.
In addition to the Olympics boost, films such as “The Bourne
Legacy” and “Ted” increased box-office sales for the
business’s movie-studio division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
