Lightway Green New Energy Co., a
Chinese solar manufacturer, agreed to provide 62.8 megawatts of
panels for U.S. power projects to ease an oversupply.  Lightway will deliver 11.9 megawatts in exchange for equity
stakes in power projects and commitments to purchase another
50.9 megawatts of photovoltaic panels through next year, the
company’s Lightway Solar America unit said today in a statement.  Accepting equity for panels instead of cash lets the
company deliver its product now, William Sien, president of
Lightway Solar America, said today in an interview. Customers
will develop revenue-generating assets to help fund the
subsequent purchases. Panel manufacturers are contending with a
global glut and slowing demand that’s driven down  prices  18
percent this year.  The arrangement increases access to project finance, one of
the solar industry’s “main bottlenecks,” Sien said. He
wouldn’t name the customers.  The company will supply panels to 11 projects in  New
Jersey , Massachusetts,  New York ,  North Carolina , Arizona and
 California  under these deals. Construction on 21 megawatts of
solar systems will begin this year, ranging in size from 250
kilowatts to 4.8 megawatts, and 42 megawatts of capacity will be
built next year, according to the statement.  The company began selling in the U.S. two years ago. It has
660 megawatts of annual production capacity for polysilicon
ingots, wafers, solar cells and panels at its headquarters in
Gaobeidian,  China , and plans to expand to 1,500 megawatts by
2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
