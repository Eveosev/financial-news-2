The rand declined, set for its first
weekly retreat in three, as commodity prices tumbled, damping
South Africa’s growth prospects. Bond yields rose.  South Africa’s currency declined as much as 0.4 percent and
traded less than 0.1 percent weaker at 8.7439 per dollar as of 9
a.m. in Johannesburg, bringing its retreat this week to 1
percent. Yields on 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 rose one basis
point to 6.69 percent, for a gain of seven basis points this
week.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of raw materials slumped
to a 12-week low as metals including copper and silver declined.
Metals and other commodities account for 45 percent of South
Africa’s exports, according to government data.  Stocks (MXEF)  fell
after Apple Inc. joined companies reporting earnings that missed
estimates, weighing on emerging-market currencies, including the
rand.  “Growth-sensitive commodities remain on a downtrend,”
John Cairns and Josina Solomons, currency strategists at Rand
Merchant Bank in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “The
rand is likely to trade sideways” until the release of U.S.
third-quarter gross domestic product data later today, they
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
