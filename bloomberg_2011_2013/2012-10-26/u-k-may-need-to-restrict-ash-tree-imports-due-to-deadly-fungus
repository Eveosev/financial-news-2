A fungus that can kill ash trees has
been discovered in the U.K., and the government may need to
restrict imports next month to prevent the disease from
spreading, the National Farmers Union said.  The fungus, chalara fraxinea pathogen, was discovered in
East Anglia, the Stoneleigh, England-based NFU said in the
 statement . It’s the first time the disease, found in other
European countries, has been established in the U.K.  Several hundred thousand ash plants are imported into the
country annually, the NFU said. The fungus is capable of
spreading “rapidly,” by as much as 20 kilometers (12 miles) to
30 kilometers a year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
