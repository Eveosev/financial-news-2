California Governor  Jerry Brown  said
voters face a “moral choice” on his ballot measure to raise
taxes to avoid deep cuts to schools.  “What we’re facing here is a very stark moral choice,”
Brown, a 74-year-old Democrat, said today at a conference of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or
NAACP, in San Mateo, near San Francisco. “Are we going to
invest in our kids, in our schools, in our colleges, in our
universities, or not?”  Brown’s measure, Proposition 30 on the Nov. 6 ballot, would
temporarily boost the  state sales tax  to 7.5 percent from 7.25
percent and raise the levy on income starting at $250,000. A
rejection by voters would trigger $5.5 billion in education
cuts.  His plan is being challenged by a competing proposal
offered by Los Angeles lawyer  Molly Munger , whose father Charles
Munger is vice chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Her
initiative, Proposition 38, would increase tax rates for 12
years on income of more than $7,316 by 0.4 percentage point for
the lowest earners to 2.2 percentage points for those making
more than $2.5 million a year.  Under his proposal, the wealthiest Californians would pay
the majority of the increased taxes, Brown said.  “The money that comes into the schools will come from the
highest income earners, those people who are the absolute
pinnacle of American success and prosperity,” Brown said.
“What we’re asking is that those individuals so blessed give
something back.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
