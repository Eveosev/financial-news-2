Merck & Co. (MRK)  reported third-quarter
profit that beat analyst estimates as sales of its diabetes
treatments helped offset losses from generic competition.  Earnings, excluding one-time items, were 95 cents a share,
topping by 2 cents the average of 17 analyst  estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Net income increased 2 percent to $1.73 billion,
or 56 cents a share, from $1.69 billion, or 55 cents, a year
earlier, the  Whitehouse Station , New Jersey-based company said
today in a statement.  Sales fell 4 percent to $11.5 billion, slightly below
analyst estimates. Merck made up for the drop in sales by
cutting costs, including a lower-than-expected  tax rate . The
drugmaker has been eliminating thousands of jobs and trying to
boost demand of existing products to overcome the revenue drop
from Singulair, which began facing competition from cheaper
copies in August.  “Merck missed on the top line a bit, but most of the miss
was Singulair, which is now off patent in the U.S. and will be
in the EU soon so we think most investors will look through
this,” said  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with ISI Group in  New
York , in a note today to clients.  Merck fell less than 1 percent to $46.15 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The  shares  have gained 38 percent in the past 12 months.  2012 Forecast  Merck said it expects 2012 earnings excluding one-time
items of $3.78 to $3.82, narrowing its previous forecast of
$3.75 to $3.85.  Sales of the diabetes drug Januvia increased 15 percent to
$975 million and sales of Janumet, which combines Januvia with
an older diabetes drug, grew 16 percent to $405 million.  Those gains helped offset a 55 percent drop in sales of
Singulair, which were $602 million. Merck also saw a decline in
sales for the cholesterol drug Vytorin, which fell 10 percent to
$423 million.  Merck said sales in  emerging markets  accounted for about 20
percent of its pharmaceutical revenue, led by a 19 percent
increase in  China . Drug sales were reduced by 5 percent because
of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, the company said.  The company said it plans to seek U.S. regulatory approval
by the end of 2013 for its insomnia drug suvorexant, its
osteoporosis treatment odanacatib, and cholesterol drug
tredaptive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
