NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) ,  India ’s largest producer
of electricity, reported its highest profit in at least eight
quarters, aided by higher tariff and lower costs.  Net income  climbed 30 percent to 31.4 billion rupees ($584
million), or 3.81 rupees a share, in the three months ended Sept.
30 from 24.2 billion rupees, or 2.94 rupees, a year earlier, the
New Delhi-based company said today in a statement. The median
profit of 22 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg was 22
billion rupees. Sales gained 4.8 percent to 161.2 billion rupees.  NTPC, which deferred 11,000 megawatts of projects because
of a shortage of coal, plans to increase its generation capacity
by 30 percent to 51,052 megawatts in the next five years. Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  is seeking $256 billion of investment by
2017 to build power plants and distribution networks that will
reduce blackouts and help accelerate economic growth.  NTPC shares were little changed at 169.15 rupees as of 2:35
p.m. in Mumbai. The stock has gained 5 percent this year,
compared with a 20 percent increase in the key Sensitive Index.  The company charged higher prices to customers after the
Central Electricity Regulatory Commission issued a revised
tariff order with effect from April 2009. NTPC’s total
expenditure dropped 3 percent to 126.8 billion rupees.  NTPC has an installed generation capacity of 39,174
megawatts, or 16 percent of the country’s total, according to
its website. The company aims to build a capacity of 128,000
megawatts by 2032, with 28 percent of its output coming from
non-fossil fuels, it said in an August 2010 stock exchange
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
