U.S. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  suffered bruises and was taken to a hospital in his home
state of Nevada after being involved in an auto accident, his
office said.  Reid, 72, was taken to University Medical Center in  Las
Vegas  after a six-car accident today on an interstate highway in
the city, said Jeremie Elliott, a Nevada Highway Patrol
spokesman. The accident involved two private cars, two city
police vehicles and two Capitol Police vehicles, Elliott said in
a telephone interview.  Reid, who suffered rib and hip bruises, was cleared for
release by doctors, his office said in an e-mailed statement. He
was taken to the hospital “as a precaution” and walked in on
his own, the statement said. Reid was wearing his seat belt at
the time of the accident, it said.  Some members of Reid’s security detail and a staff member
were evaluated at the hospital for minor injuries, according to
the statement.  Reid, a Democrat from Searchlight,  Nevada , was first
elected to the Senate in 1986 and became majority leader in
2007.  In 2010, Reid’s wife, Landra, and the couple’s daughter,
Lana, were injured when their car was struck from behind by a
tractor-trailer truck on a Virginia highway near  Washington .
Reid said at the time that his wife suffered a broken neck and
back during the accident and that his daughter “was cut up and
shook up” and suffered dizziness.  To contact the reporters on this story:
