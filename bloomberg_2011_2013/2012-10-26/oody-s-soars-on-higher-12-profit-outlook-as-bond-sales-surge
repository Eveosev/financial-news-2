Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  climbed as much as 8.3
percent after boosting its outlook for 2012 earnings and
reporting third-quarter profit increased 41 percent as
corporate-bond sales soared.  The world’s second-largest provider of credit ratings rose
4.8 percent to close at $47.89 in New York after earlier
reaching $49.50, the highest intraday level since October 2007.
The stock has gained 42 percent this year.  Companies from the U.S. to Europe to Asia tapped debt
markets at the fastest pace ever in a third quarter with
worldwide corporate issuance at $991.4 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Federal Reserve has held its
target rate for overnight loans among banks between zero and
0.25 percent since December 2008 to spur economic growth after
the longest recession since the 1930s.  “Rates are low, the market appetite for yield is high, and
refinancing is taking place,”  Peter Appert , an analyst with
Piper Jaffray & Co. in San Francisco, said in a telephone
interview before the results were announced. “Debt issuance is
what drives the revenue numbers at Moody’s.”  Net income climbed to $183.9 million from $130.7 million a
year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a
statement distributed by  Business Wire . Profit was 81 cents per
share, exceeding the average estimate of 62 cents in a Bloomberg
 survey  of analysts. The New York-based company boosted its
outlook for 2012 earnings per share to a range of $2.95 to
$3.05, from a previous range of $2.76 to $2.86.  Revenue Rises  Moody’s said revenue rose 30 percent to $688.5 million for
the quarter, from $531.3 million in the year earlier period. The
firm’s analytics unit, which sells software and consulting
services, accounted for $215 million of that total, up 20
percent from a year earlier. Ratings from Moody’s Investors
Service account for about 70 percent of the firm’s  revenue  in
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  is Moody’s biggest
 shareholder , with a 13 percent stake, worth about $1.4 billion,
Bloomberg data show.  The largest credit-ratings company,  Standard & Poor’s , a
New York-based unit of McGraw-Hill Cos., is scheduled to  report 
earnings Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
