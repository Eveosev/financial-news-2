Russia  will reduce crude shipments
from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  in November, a final loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  Crude exports from the port will be 3.065 million metric
tons next month, excluding a top-up cargo of 45,000 tons,
according to the schedule. That is down from 3.7 million tons in
October. The volume of exports is unchanged from a preliminary
program obtained Oct. 25.  The Novorossiysk shipments include four 80,000 ton lots of
Siberian Light grade, the program showed. The remaining 25
cargoes, totaling 2.745 million tons, are Urals blend. One
140,000 ton slot from Novorossiysk is free, or unallocated.  Russia will ship 56 cargoes of Urals from the Baltic Sea
port of Primorsk in November, according to the final plan.  Shipments from this port are unchanged from this month and
will total 5.605 million tons, excluding a top-up cargo of
15,000 tons, the schedule showed. The program includes three
100,000 ton free positions, one more than in the preliminary
plan.  There are 18 Urals cargoes from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea 
totaling 1.8 million tons scheduled for November, down from 2.1
million tons this month, according to the final program. Two of
next monthâ€™s lots from the terminal are also unallocated.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
