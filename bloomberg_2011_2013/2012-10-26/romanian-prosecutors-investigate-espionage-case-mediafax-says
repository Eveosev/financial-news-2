Romania’s prosecutors started an
investigation into  IPROMIN SA  after officials allegedly provided
classified information about copper and other precious metal
reserves to Russian business men,  Mediafax  reported.  Officials at IPROMIN, a mining research and design
institute, are being investigated after a Russian citizen was
caught at Bucharest airport while trying to leave the country
with classified geological maps, which include information about
mineral deposits at Moldova Noua mining area, in the west of the
country, Mediafax said.  Gabriel Neamtu, a director at IPROMIN, didn’t immediately
respond to phone calls from Bloomberg seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
