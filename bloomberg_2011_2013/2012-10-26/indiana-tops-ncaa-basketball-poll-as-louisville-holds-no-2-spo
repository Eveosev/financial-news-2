Indiana University  was No. 1 in the
Associated Press preseason Top 25 college basketball poll for
the first time in 33 years.  With all five starters returning, the Bloomington,  Indiana ,
Hoosiers received 43 of 65 first-place votes to lead the season-
opening poll for the first time since 1979-80, AP said.  “It’s great. Those things are great,” said Tom Crean, who
starts his fifth season as the Hoosiers’ coach. “I think now,
it’s just so much about the daily challenge of getting better.
That to me is what the focus is.”  Indiana hosts Indiana Wesleyan on Nov. 1.  Louisville ranked second with 20 first-place votes,
followed by defending national champion Kentucky, which was
picked first on two ballots from national media members.  Ohio State and Michigan completed the top five, followed by
North Carolina State,  Kansas , Duke, Syracuse and Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
