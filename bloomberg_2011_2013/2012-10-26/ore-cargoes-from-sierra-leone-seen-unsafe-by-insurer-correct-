(Corrects to say West African in second paragraph.)  Iron-ore exports from  Sierra Leone 
may be unsafe because the moisture content of the steel-making
commodity is too high, creating the risk some shipments may
liquefy during transit, the  London P&I Club  said.  There’s no equipment in the West African country that can
sample cargoes to check whether they exceed international
moisture limits for safe transport, the club, a ship owners’
association that provides protection and indemnity insurance,
said by e-mail today.  “Ships are being offered iron-ore cargoes for loading in
Sierra Leone which are unsafe,” the club said, citing cases
received from Brookes Bell LLP, a marine consultant it hired.
“Limited local expertise and technology, together with poor
communications, are exacerbating the problems.”  Dry-bulk commodities with excessive moisture content can
liquefy and turn to slurry during voyages, causing vessels to
capsize. A total of 66 seafarers between December 2010 and
February 2012 died after vessels sank after cargoes of nickel-
ore liquefied, according to the London-based International
Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners.  Two shippers have resumed exports of  iron ore  after a 10-
year civil war ended, the London Club said. Surveyors had to use
the oven in the ship’s galley in one case to try and determine
the moisture content of one cargo, it said.  China  imported 609,136 metric tons of iron ore worth $64.4
million from Sierra Leone last month, according to Customs  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
