The World Bank is studying plans by
South  Sudan  to build a highway to link to the Kenyan port of
Mombasa, according to a World Bank senior transport engineer who
works in the country.  The bank is considering funding the project and is working
with the governments of South Sudan and  Kenya  to find co-
financers, Tesfamichael Nahusenay said Oct. 24 in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The highway will help the country diversify its economy
away from oil, which provides 98 percent of government revenue,
by attracting “export-oriented investment,” he said. South
Sudan’s deputy minister for roads and bridges, Simon Mijok, said
in a phone interview that the road will also reduce the costs of
imports to the landlocked nation. Most goods currently imported
from  Mombasa  are hauled by truck through Uganda.  “The corridor will open up access to massive fertile land
in Eastern Equatoria and southern Jonglei states, which have
abundant agricultural potential and animal resources, and
provide access to markets due to the proximity to the regional
and international market,” Nahusenay said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
