U.S. State regulators approved new
 guidelines  for mortgage bonds that will require insurers to set
aside more capital as the watchdogs evaluate how economic stress
would affect the firms’ investments.  Insurers will need to hold about 0.5 percentage point more
capital for residential mortgage-backed securities under the
standards, the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners 
said in an e-mail today. Requirements for commercial mortgage-
backed securities will have a “minor” change, according to the
NAIC’s statement.  State watchdogs evaluate insurers’ investments to make sure
the companies can meet obligations on policies they have sold.
The increased capital requirements stem from a report that
deemed the mortgage-backed investments to be more risky than
they had previously been considered.  “The underlying scenario assumes a slow economic recovery
with a slight further deterioration in residential  home prices 
and a slow improvement in employment,” consultants who help
assess the investments wrote in a  report  dated Oct. 16.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the guidelines were
approved earlier today, lifting the capital requirement to 3.2
percent from 2.7 percent.  Editors: Dan Kraut, Dan Reichl  To contact the reporter on this story:
