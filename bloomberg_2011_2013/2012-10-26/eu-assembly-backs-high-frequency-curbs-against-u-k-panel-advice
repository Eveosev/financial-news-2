 European Union lawmakers renewed
calls for tougher curbs on high-frequency trading and limits on
commodity speculation as part of a push to toughen the 27-nation
bloc’s financial-market rulebook.  European Parliament legislators, voting in Strasbourg
today, defined the assembly’s stance before talks on the
proposals begin with national governments. They also agreed to
largely scrap proposals to boost competition between
clearinghouses, saying the measures may harm financial
stability.  Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial services chief, proposed
the measures last year. The parliament and EU member states must
hammer out an agreement before the steps take effect.  The U.K. government’s lead scientific adviser, John
Beddington, this week warned against implementing some of the
curbs on high-frequency trading, saying they may choke off
benefits to the economy and hamper the functioning of markets.  Rules backed by the assembly include a requirement for
traders to hold orders in the market for at least half a second
and punitive fees for excessive numbers of canceled orders.  Markus Ferber, the German lawmaker steering the bill
through the EU parliament, has said the curbs are needed to
ensure that high-frequency trading brings genuine benefits to
markets and doesn’t cause instability.  Today’s vote echoes positions approved last month by the
assembly’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
