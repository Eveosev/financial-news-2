Aon Plc (AON) , the insurance broker that
moved its headquarters to  London  from Chicago, rallied after
gaining in each of the company’s priority metrics for the first
time in three years.  Aon, the world’s largest insurance broker, jumped 2.9
percent to $53.84 at 4:04 p.m. in New York, the largest advance
in the 24-company  KBW Insurance index .  Third-quarter organic revenue, which excludes results from
currency fluctuations and acquisitions, climbed 4 percent,
compared with a 1 percent improvement a year earlier, the
company said in a  slide show  today. The operating margin
advanced to 17.5 percent from 17.2 percent. Operating earnings
were 95 cents a share, exceeding last year’s result by 7 cents.  “Our third quarter reflects improvement in each of our
three metrics for the first time since the beginning of 2009,”
Chief Executive Officer Greg Case said in a conference call with
analysts today.  The earnings beat the  average estimate  of 16 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg by 5 cents per share. Net income climbed
to $204 million from $198 million.  Results were driven by “better than anticipated adjusted
operating margin performance,” Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP
analysts led by Paul Newsome wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
