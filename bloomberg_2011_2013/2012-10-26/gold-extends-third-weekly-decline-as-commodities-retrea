Gold declined in  New York , extending
a third weekly drop, as commodities fell and a stronger dollar
curbed demand for bullion as an alternative investment.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials fell
to the lowest in almost three months. The  U.S. Dollar  Index, a
measure against six major trading partners, reached a six-week
high as data showed Spanish unemployment climbed to a record in
the third quarter. Gold’s third week of losses would be the
longest losing run since September last year.  “It’s all related to current risk-off trading,”  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative Commodity Research Ltd. in
Hainburg, Germany, said today by phone. “There’s a firmer U.S.
dollar. Precious metals are part of the commodity complex,” and
can decline when other commodities fall, he said.  Gold for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to $1,703.50 an
ounce by 7:46 a.m. on the Comex in New York. It slid to
$1,698.70 on Oct. 24, the lowest since Sept. 7, and is down 1.2
percent this week. Bullion for immediate delivery was 0.5
percent lower at $1,703.05 in London.  Gold reached a 10-month high of $1,798.10 on Oct. 5 as
central banks from  Europe  to  China  to the U.S. pledged more
stimulus to boost economies. Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-
traded products  gained 0.6 metric ton to a record 2,585.1 tons
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report today may show
that the world’s largest economy expanded at a 1.8 percent
annual rate in the third quarter after growing at a 1.3 percent
pace the prior quarter, according to the median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Silver for December delivery fell 1.1 percent to $31.74 an
ounce and is set for a sixth weekly decline. Platinum for
January delivery was down 1.2 percent at $1,550.60 an ounce. It
slid 4 percent this week. Palladium for December delivery
slipped 1.3 percent to $596.85 an ounce, extending the weekly
drop to 4.2 percent, the most in a month.  To contact the reporter for this story:
