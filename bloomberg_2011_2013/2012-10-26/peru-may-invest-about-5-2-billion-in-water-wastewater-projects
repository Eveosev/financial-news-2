Peru  is aiming to improve access to
potable water in cities including  Lima  and rural areas with
about $5.2 billion of projects and investments over the
2010-2016 period, the state news agency Andina said.  Drinking water coverage in Peru’s cities was about 89
percent two years ago and the government aims to increase that
to 92 percent by 2016 with infrastructure upgrades, the Housing
Ministry said. The government also hopes to improve wastewater
treatment access with $521 million in projects during that
period, Andina said in a statement.  The government estimates 1 million people in Lima, the
country’s largest city and capital with 10 million residents,
don’t have access to running water. The government said it hopes
to boost potable water coverage in rural areas to 57 percent
from 39 percent two years ago with the investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
