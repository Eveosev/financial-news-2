Warren Buffett ’s MidAmerican Energy
Holdings Co. agreed to fund half the cost of natural gas-fueled
 power plants  built or bought by  TransAlta Corp. (TA)  in  Canada , where
the companies say almost $200 billion in new investment is
needed during the next 20 years.  “At MidAmerican, we have been seeking an entry point to
the Canadian electricity generation market, where we see strong
potential for growth,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Greg Abel said in a statement today.  The companies didn’t put a
value on the venture or planned spending. TransAlta, based in
Calgary, will build, operate and maintain the plants.  MidAmerican has been betting on power generation through
investments in an Illinois wind project and a solar operation in
 California . Buffett, 82, has said that businesses like utilities
have earnings power even under adverse economic conditions.  TransAlta expects British Columbia will need 2,000
megawatts of new power capacity, enough for 1.6 million homes in
the U.S., for plants exporting liquefied natural gas to  Asia  and
other regions, Chief Executive Officer Dawn Farrell said in an
interview on Sept. 21. Canada is the world’s third-largest
producer of gas.  Liquefied natural gas export plants need energy to cool gas
into liquid for shipping. Two terminals are planned in British
Columbia at Kitimat and Prince Rupert.  Sundance Construction  TransAlta has spent about C$4 billion ($4.02 billion) since
2005 to build 1,600 megawatts of new power capacity, including
coal and renewables, according to the company’s website. The
company operates in  Alberta , where it has 30 percent of the
power market, as well as Washington, California and Australia.  The partnership will include Sundance 7, a new plant in
Alberta that will cost C$1.2 billion to C$1.4 billion and begin
construction in 2014, according to estimates from TransAlta last
year.  “Notionally, it’s positive for TransAlta to have a strong
financial backer with MidAmerican,” Jeremy Rosenfield, a
Montreal-based analyst for Desjardins Securities Inc., said
today in a telephone interview. MidAmerican is a unit of
Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   MidAmerican spent $1.5 billion on capital projects in the
first half and forecast another $2.3 billion in expenses for the
remainder of the year, according to a Berkshire regulatory
filing. The energy company will use operating cash flows and
debt issuances to fund those projects, according to the filing.  Previous Alliance  The companies in July 2001 announced an alliance to
develop, build and operate coal, gas and hydro-generation plants
in certain markets throughout  North America , including Mexico.  TransAlta rose 3.4 percent to C$15.73 at the close in
Toronto. It fell 28 percent this year before today.  Also today, TransAlta reported net income rose 12 percent
to C$56 million, or 24 cents a share, from $50 million, or 22
cents, a year earlier. Profit excluding some items was 18 cents,
about 5 cents less than the average of 10 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
