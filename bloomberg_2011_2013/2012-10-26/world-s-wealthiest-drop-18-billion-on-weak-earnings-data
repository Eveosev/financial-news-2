The 100 richest people on the planet
dropped $17.7 billion from their collective net worth this week
after disappointing corporate earnings in the U.S. were
compounded by worries over economic growth.  Jeff Bezos , founder of  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s largest
online retailer, lost $120 million. The Seattle-based company
reported revenue that was less than analysts’ estimates and
posted the first quarterly net loss since 2003. Bezos, 48, ranks
21st on the list with a net worth of $22.5 billion, according to
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “It’s a better than feared type of situation,” said
Herman Leung, an analyst at Susquehanna International Group, a
Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania-based quantitative trading firm, in a
telephone interview from his San Francisco office. “The eco-
systems that all these companies play in have implications to
everybody else.”  Lackluster earnings reports by  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and DuPont Co.
helped drag down the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index 1.48 percent
for the week to close at 1411.94 in New York. The Federal
Reserve said Wednesday that the economy is still growing
modestly and unemployment remains elevated as it maintains $40
billion in monthly purchases of mortgage-backed securities aimed
at spurring the three-year expansion.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 1.3 percent, closing at
270.51.  Slim, Ortega  Mexican telecommunications magnate  Carlos Slim , 72, remains
the richest person in the world, with a fortune of $75.6
billion, down $2 billion. Second is  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  co-founder
Bill Gates, 56, with $62.5 billion.  Europe’s richest man,  Amancio Ortega , is No. 3 on the index
with a net worth of $52 billion, $5.6 billion ahead of  Warren
Buffett , 82. The 76-year-old founder of  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s
biggest clothing retailer and owner of the Zara clothing chain,
has gained more than $16 billion this year.  Viktor Vekselberg became Russia’s richest man on Tuesday
after OAO Rosneft, Russia’s state-controlled oil and gas
operator, agreed to pay $54.8 billion to acquire TNK-BP in the
third-biggest oil acquisition ever. The 55-year-old Vekselberg
is worth $17.9 billion, $900 million ahead of metals and
technology investor Alisher Usmanov.  Central Park  Hedge fund manager  John Paulson , 56, announced a $100
million gift to the Central Park Conservancy on Tuesday, the
largest parks donation ever. In a letter sent on Oct. 4, Paulson
told clients that his $20 billion firm, Paulson & Co., decreased
its hedges, or offsetting trades, after the Fed outlined
additional steps to boost the economy and the European Central
Bank took measures to guard against a sovereign default. Paulson
ranks 75th on the list with a net worth of $11.8 billion.  Mark Zuckerberg, CEO and co-founder of  Facebook Inc. (FB) , added
$1.5 billion to his fortune after the world’s biggest social
networking site reported sales of $1.26 billion, topping
analysts’ average estimates of $1.23 billion. Facebook stock
jumped 19.1 percent on Wednesday, pushing Zuckerberg up 21
places on the index, the biggest one-day move by any billionaire
since Bloomberg began tracking the world’s richest people on
March 5. The 28-year-old ranks 83rd with a net worth of $11.2
billion.  The  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  takes measure of the
world’s wealthiest people based on market and economic changes
and Bloomberg News reporting. Each net worth figure is updated
every business day at 5:30 p.m. in New York. The valuations are
listed in U.S. dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
