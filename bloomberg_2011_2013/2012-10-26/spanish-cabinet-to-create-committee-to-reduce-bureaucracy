Spain’s Cabinet will agree today to
create a committee to reduce bureaucracy and eliminate overlap
between the nation’s three levels of government.  The Cabinet decision, due to be announced at about 2 p.m.
in  Madrid  after the weekly meeting, is the first step in Prime
Minister Mariano Rajoy’s plan to pare the public administration
and improve efficiency, said a spokesman at his office who asked
not to be named in line with policy.  Spain’s public administration swelled in the three decades
since regional governments were created. The 17 states, which
control health and education, employ about half of all public
workers. The regions, which duplicated existing institutions by
creating agencies such as trade and diplomatic missions during
the boom, account for about a third of public spending.  To contact the reporter on this story:
