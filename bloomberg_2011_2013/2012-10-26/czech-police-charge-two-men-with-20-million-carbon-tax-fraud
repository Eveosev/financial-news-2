Czech police charged two men over a
378 million-koruna ($19.6 million) value-added tax fraud from
trading carbon credits.  The trades took place in 2010, the Prague-based police said
in a statement on its website today. Neither of the two Czech
trading companies from which the men pretended to buy carbon
credits were authorized to trade with emissions allowances,
police said. If convicted, they face a sentence of as many as 10
years in prison.  To contact the reporter on this story:
