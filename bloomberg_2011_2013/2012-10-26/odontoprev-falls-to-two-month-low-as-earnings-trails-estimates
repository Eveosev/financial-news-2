Odontoprev SA (ODPV3) , a Brazilian dental
benefits company, fell to a two-month low after third-quarter
profit trailed analysts’ estimates.  Shares dropped 2.8 percent to 10.19 reais at 4:02 p.m. in
Sao Paulo. The benchmark  Bovespa index  slid 1.2 percent.  Third-quarter net income fell 9.5 percent to 35.4 million
reais ($17.5 million), Odontoprev said in a regulatory filing
yesterday. That compares to an average  estimate  of 42.5 million
reais among 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales were 243.1
million reais, compared with an estimate of 244.6 million reais.  “A slowing economy in  Brazil  limited the potential of
sales of plans to companies,” Karina Freitas, an analyst at
brokerage Concordia, wrote in a note to clients dated today.  Odontoprev gained 19 percent this year through yesterday,
while the Bovespa advanced 1.9 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
