China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, dropped the most
in more than three years in  Hong Kong  trading after third-
quarter profit missed analysts’ estimates.  Unicom  fell  7.6 percent to HK$12.72, its largest decline
since April 1, 2009. The  stock  has lost 22 percent this year
while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index  has gained 17 percent.  Net income  rose 27 percent to 2.02 billion  yuan  ($324
million), compared with the 2.21 billion-yuan median of seven
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Chairman Chang Xiaobing turned to low-cost smartphones priced at 1,000 yuan or
less, luring price-conscious users such as students, after
losing the advantage as the only Chinese carrier to offer Apple
Inc.’s iPhone with a service plan.  “Monthly data usage of its 3G subscribers appears
lackluster,” Steven Liu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Bank,
said in a report as he cut his recommendation to underperform.
The stock “trades at a substantial premium to its domestic
peers, which is unjustified given its poor earnings
capability,” he wrote.  Revenue rose 16 percent to 63.5 billion yuan in the third
quarter, beating the median estimate of 63 billion yuan in the
Bloomberg News survey.  Unicom faced “keen market competition” to speed user
growth in the period, the company said in yesterday’s statement.
As a result, selling and marketing expenses surged 23 percent to
25.4 billion yuan in the first nine months of this year, the
company said. Its cost of telecommunications products sold
jumped 48 percent to 33.8 billion yuan for the nine months, the
company said.  Unicom had 66.9 million 3G subscribers at the end of the
third quarter, lagging behind the 75.6 million for market leader
 China Mobile Ltd. (941) , according to data the companies released this
month. The smaller operator, which also offers fixed-line
broadband Internet services, had a mobile customer base of 229.5
million, or 33 percent of China Mobile’s 698.5 million.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
