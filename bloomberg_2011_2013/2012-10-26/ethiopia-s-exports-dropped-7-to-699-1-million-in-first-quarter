Ethiopian exports dropped 7 percent
to $699.1 million in the first quarter as shipments of coffee
and oil seeds fell, the Trade Ministry said.  Foreign sales of coffee in the continent’s largest producer
of the beans earned $199.3 million in the four months through
Oct. 10, compared with $201.9 million in the same period a year
earlier, the Addis Ababa-based ministry said in an e-mailed
statement on Oct. 24. Ethiopia’s calendar has 13 months, one of
which runs from Sept. 6 to Sept. 10.  The second-most valuable export in the quarter was gold,
which increased 2 percent to $132.7 million, the ministry said.
The stimulant qhat raised $69.5 million in foreign exchange, an
increase of 1 percent, it said.  Ethiopia posted a trade deficit of $7.5 billion in the
fiscal year ended July 7 as a result of slowing growth in
exports and increased import costs, according to  Access Capital ,
an Addis Ababa-based research group. Exports may earn $3.9
billion this fiscal year, compared with $3.2 billion last year,
when they grew 14 percent, it said in August.  Foreign sales of oil seeds fell 27 percent in the quarter
to 60.8 million, while exports of cereals surged 63 percent to
$48.1 million, the ministry said. Shipments of leather products
fell 20 percent to $24.8 million and sales of textiles dropped
28 percent to $19.8 million, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
