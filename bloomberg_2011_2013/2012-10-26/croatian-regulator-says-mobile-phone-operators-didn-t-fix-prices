The Croatian  Competition Agency  said
it found no direct evidence of price fixing among mobile phone
operators T-Hrvatski Telekom d.d., Vipnet d.o.o. and Tele2.  The regulator said it investigated allegations the
providers violated competition rules by “coordinating
activities” to sharply increase tariffs for voice calls within
mobile networks in October 2009, at a time when the government
imposed a 6 percent tax on mobile services, the Zagreb-based
Agency said in a  statement  on its website.  “Although there were indications of coordinated action,”
including the operators’ joint public statement that they would
take measures to counter the effect of the tax, the authorities
found no wrongdoing, the regulator said.  T-Hrvatski, the country’s biggest telecommunications
provider, is a unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , while Vipnet is
owned by  Telekom Austria AG (TKA) , and Tele2 is a unit of  Tele2 AB (TEL2B) ,
Sweden’s second-largest telephone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
