The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 0.4 percent to 634.72 at 5:57 p.m. Singapore
time.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell, poised for the biggest weekly drop in a month, on
speculation U.S. economic growth won’t be enough to boost demand
amid increasing stockpiles.  Crude for December delivery fell as much as $1.05 to $85 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $85.13 at 8:50 a.m. London time. The contract
yesterday snapped the longest losing streak in five months,
gaining 32 cents to settle at $86.05. Prices are down 5.4
percent this week, the most since the five days ending Sept. 21.  BASE METALS  Copper declined to the lowest level in seven weeks in
 Shanghai  on renewed concern over growth in  China , the largest
user, amid a slump in equities. Industrial metals from aluminum
to lead fell.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined along with commodities, extending losses for
a third straight week, after Asian stocks fell as China Unicom
(Hong Kong) Ltd. joined Apple Inc. and other companies posting
results that missed analysts’ estimates.  Gold for immediate delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$1,700.90 an ounce and traded at $1,703.80 at 2:33 p.m. in
Singapore. Prices are set to decline 1 percent this week.
Bullion for December delivery dropped as much as 0.7 percent to
$1,703.80 on the Comex in New York.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Rubber declined from a one-week high, paring the first
weekly advance in three, as concerns grew that a slowdown in
global economies will curb raw-material demand.  Rubber for March delivery dropped 1 percent to settle at
257.7 yen a kilogram ($3,224 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. The contract increased 0.9 percent this
week.  Soybeans and corn fell as commodities and stocks tumbled on
concerns that a slowing global economy will hurt demand. Wheat
declined even after the International Grains Council cut its
harvest forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
