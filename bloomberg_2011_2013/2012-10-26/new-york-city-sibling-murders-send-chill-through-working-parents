When Marina Krim found two of her young children fatally stabbed upon returning home to the family’s Upper West Side apartment, their nanny alongside them, stabbing herself, the world of New York child care was instantly changed. As the news quickly spread, parents across New York City and beyond were shaken to their core.  For decades, the business of entrusting young children to a nanny has been a fraught yet informal affair for busy dual- career New York couples. Leaving children in the care of others tended to be a process that was patched together, word-of-mouth affairs with little more to guide parents than a wink of encouragement from a trusted neighbor. Now, the wisdom and safety of that time-tested approach has been crushed. In neighborhoods, workplaces, and on blogs, professional and stay- at-home parents alike are questioning their path forward.  “I can imagine every mother who’s heard about this is scared to walk out of their house,” said Lisa Berger, a married mother with a 6-year-old in the Williamsburg section of  Brooklyn , New York, who has two jobs and works 60 hours per week.  “Everyone puts their children into the hands of others,” Berger said. “Sure, you can run a background check and drug tests but you can never determine how people are going to act in certain situations or know their breaking points.”  The Krim family could never have known the terrible consequences of their choice of child care. One-year-old Leo Krim and 6-year-old sister Lucia were found in a bathtub by their mother, Marina, who returned to their home at about 5:30 p.m. on Oct. 25, according to police. The children had been left with their nanny, Yoselyn Ortega.  Critical Condition  The children’s father, Kevin Krim, worked at Bloomberg LP until last year when he joined CNBC as general manager for digital.  Ortega, 50, is in critical condition at New York- Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, and police haven’t been able to speak with her, New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said during a press conference at NYPD headquarters yesterday. Possible charges have yet to be determined, Kelly said.  “It’s difficult to say” when police will be able to speak to the nanny, because she is intubated and has cuts to her wrists and neck, Kelly said yesterday. “Obviously, it depends on a doctor’s determination,” he said.  Ortega, a native of the Dominican Republic, is a naturalized U.S. citizen and has lived in the country for about 10 years, Kelly said. She was referred to the family by friends and had been working for them for about two years, Kelly said.  Found in Bathroom  The nanny lived at another location on  Manhattan ’s West Side with her son, her sister and her sister’s daughter, Kelly said. The nanny’s family is cooperating with police, the commissioner said.  There is no history of mental illness with the nanny of which police are aware and no domestic incident reports involving the woman, Kelly said.  The mother had gone to a neighborhood YMCA for swimming lessons with her 3-year-old daughter and was supposed to meet the nanny and the two other children at a dance studio later in the evening, Kelly said.  When the nanny didn’t show, the mother went to the apartment and found her 1-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter clothed and in the bathroom with stab wounds to their bodies, said Paul Browne, an NYPD spokesman. When the mother entered the bathroom, the nanny started to stab herself, Browne said. When police arrived, the nanny was on the bathroom floor with a knife next to her.  Worst Nightmare  Detectives met the father of the two children, who was on his way back to the city from a business trip, at John F. Kennedy International Airport and escorted him to the hospital, Browne said.  The tragedy that’s befallen the Krims is every family’s worst nightmare. It has parents across the city and the country rethinking how they go about hiring nannies. Until Oct. 25, it used to go something like this: A neighbor lets it be known an excellent nanny is about to become available because the family she works for is being transferred to  London . Another will be free next year because the child she has spent the last five years tending to is off to first grade.  Heather Stone, a stay-at-home mom with a 1-year-old son in Williamsburg, said she hired her caretaker after a 20-minute interview and a recommendation from a working mom. She trusts her nanny, she said, but the killings made her rethink how she approached the hiring process.  “Next time, I would definitely get more references,” she said.  Detailed Screenings  The fallout is likely to affect day-care centers to which parents may turn in greater numbers. Lisandra Lopez, director at Mabel Barrett Fitzgerald Day Care Center in Manhattan, said the most common question she gets from parents choosing day care is how the staff are screened. They’re concerned about the cooks and volunteers as well as the teachers. Anyone who works at her center gets background checks, Lopez said in an interview yesterday.  “I’m a parent and a grandmother,” she said. “If you’re going to trust your child to anyone, no matter what the situation, that person should be screened, totally.”  Terri Brax, founder and chief executive officer of TeacherCare, a personal childcare and education company, said the events prompted informal internal discussions emphasizing the importance of detailed screenings of all job candidates.  “People might see how valuable all that screening is,” Brax said.  Security Cameras  Some anxious parents are turning to a technological fix. Daniel McBride, owner of American Eagle Investigations, a Manhattan surveillance company, said he received three calls from parents before 9 a.m. yesterday.  “One caller wanted everything possible, and others just wanted some advice,” said McBride, whose company installs in- home security cameras that parents can monitor remotely. “It’s a knee-jerk reaction, but they’re practices people should think about before hiring.”  Meantime, parents’ groups are grappling to make sense of the tragedy. There’s a feeling of solidarity among parents when such a tragedy occurs, said Leslie Venokur, the co-founder of Big City Moms, a social organization for working parents in New York.  “The whole mom community, we feel like we know each other and we know each others’ kids,” she said. “When something happens to a fellow young family, it feels like it’s happening right in our backyard.”  Grieving Nannies  Online message boards for parents in the city such as  UrbanBaby.com  are filled with anonymous posts from parents angry and worried about the screening of caregivers.  “No one knows the background of what happened,” Venokur said in an interview yesterday. “It’s bad enough for working moms where we have this guilt that we’re not always there for our children, and then you throw this into the mix.”  New York nannies are also grieving and say they worry that the tragedy will result in distrust from local families.  Cliff Greenhouse, president of the  Pavillion Agency , a Manhattan group that places caregivers, said nannies have called him to share their sadness over the tragedy and their worries about how it will tarnish their reputations.  “They’re devastated because this is what they do, and they love what they do,” Greenhouse said. “The nannies we’re working with are doing this by choice.”  To contact the reporters on this story: Ryan Faughnder in New York at   rfaughnder@bloomberg.net ; Renee Dudley in New York at   rdudley6@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Rick Schine at   eschine@bloomberg.net
