The Bundesbank said it welcomes a
new law that will introduce macro-prudential supervision at a
national level and the formation of a Financial Stability Board.  The Financial Stability Act, which has been passed by the
lower house of parliament, will strengthen German financial
supervision and respect the Bundesbank’s independence, the
Frankfurt-based central bank said in a statement.  The act envisages the establishment of a German Financial
Stability Board on which the Bundesbank, the Federal Ministry of
Finance and the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority will
each have three representatives, the Bundesbank said.  “It will discuss issues that are key to financial
stability, and will be able to issue warnings and
recommendations if financial stability comes under threat,”
Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said in the statement.
“ Germany  is showing that it has learned a key lesson from the
financial crisis. We welcome the fact that there will now be a
clear and separate legal mandate for macro-prudential
oversight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
