Italian business confidence
unexpectedly fell this month as signs the country’s fourth
recession since 2001 is deepening fueled pessimism among
manufacturers.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  declined this month to
87.6 from a 88.3 in September, Rome-based national statistics
institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted an October
reading of 88.7, according to the median of 13 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Italy entered a recession in the final quarter of last year
as the global slowdown aggravated the effects of waning
productivity and tax increases and public spending cuts passed
by Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s government to contain the euro-
region’s second biggest weighed on demand. The government last
month revised its forecasts and said the economy will shrink 2.4
percent this year, twice its previous prediction.  Still, Industrial  output  unexpectedly rose in August,
signalling the recession may be easing and  consumer confidence 
gained this month as the government announced tax cuts for the
lowest earners to offset the effect of an increase on the value-
added levy next year.  The  Bank of Italy  predicts that Italy will emerge from the
recession next year, while the economy is still likely to
contract in 2013. The  International Monetary Fund  estimated this
month in its World Economic Outlook that the economy will
contract 2.4 percent in 2012 and 0.7 percent next year.  -- With assistance from Giovanni Salzano in  Rome . Editors:
