Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  said it will
tender for as much as $7.7 billion of bonds as the drug and
medical-device company that plans to split in two prepares to
raise about $16 billion of debt.  A deal that size would be the biggest since 2009, when a
new issue last topped $10 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The largest offerings this year include a $9.8
billion issue from United Technologies Corp. in May and a $7.5
billion sale from Anheuser-Busch InBev NV in July, Bloomberg
data show.  Abbott, which makes the world’s top-selling medicine
Humira, made a tender offer for four bonds with $4.75 billion
outstanding and as much as 47.2 percent on five other issues
with $6.25 billion, the company said today in a statement.  AbbVie Inc., a spinoff of Abbott’s pharmaceutical
operations, will raise just under $16 billion of debt in coming
weeks, Thomas Freyman, senior vice president, finance and chief
financial officer at Abbott said on an Oct. 17 earnings call.
AbbVie will make a cash distribution of about $8.5 billion to
Abbott which the company will use to help fund the tender and
pay down a portion of its commercial paper debt.  Abbott’s corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings were
lowered to A+ from AA by Standard & Poor’s today due to the
spinoff, the ratings company said in a release.  Third-quarter sales fell 0.4 percent to $9.77 billion from
a year earlier, missing the $9.94 billion average of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding the effect of foreign
currency exchange, sales increased 4.1 percent, Abbott said in a
statement today.  AbbVie will pay a $1.60 a share annual dividend, while
Abbott shareholders will get 56 cents a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
