China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down by the most in five weeks, as companies
from  Maanshan Iron & Steel Co. (600808)  to  ZTE Corp. (000063)  reported losses.  Maanshan Steel tumbled the most in 14 months after its
third-quarter loss was wider than analysts estimated. ZTE,
China’s second-largest maker of telephone equipment, retreated 2
percent to its lowest level since 2008.  Hisense Electric Co. (600060) ,
the biggest maker of flat-panel televisions, plunged by the 10
percent maximum limit after profit dropped. The National Bureau
of Statistics is due to release industrial companies’ September
earnings tomorrow. Profits fell 6.2 percent in August.  “The market is still worried about the magnitude of the
economic recovery and deterioration of corporate earnings,”
said Wu Kan, a fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co. in
 Shanghai , which oversees $285 million.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.7 percent to
2,066.21 at the close, the most since Sept. 20. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.9 percent to 2,247.91. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong
retreated 1.3 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.3 percent in New York yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite dropped 2.9 percent this week,
capping its first decline in four weeks. The measure, which has
slumped 6.1 percent this year, trades at 9.8 times estimated
earnings for this year, compared with the 17.8 average since
Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006.  China’s 1,175 investment funds lost 74.9 billion  yuan  ($12
billion) in the third quarter, as stock prices continued to fall
and bond yields rose, the China Securities Journal said, citing
TX Investment data.  Low Expectations  Domestic fund managers don’t have “high expectations”
about stock performances this quarter as economic recovery is
likely to be weak and the economy faces “structural”
transformation, the Shanghai Securities News reported today,
citing funds’ quarterly reports. Fund managers increased
holdings of food, beverage and pharmaceutical stocks in the
third quarter, the newspaper said.  A measure of 54 material stocks in the CSI 300 slumped 3.3
percent, the biggest loss among the 10 industry groups.  Maanshan Steel declined 4.4 percent to 1.97 yuan, the
biggest retreat since August 2011. The company posted a third-
quarter loss of 1.24 billion yuan, compared with a mean estimate
for a 653 million yuan loss, according to three analysts in a
survey.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. (600111) , China’s
biggest producer of rare earth, tumbled 7 percent to 28.92 yuan
for a sixth straight day of declines. Fortune CLSA Securities
Ltd. cut its rating to sell from underperform and lowered the
share-price estimate to 25 yuan, citing concerns over
“destocking pressure” and caution over future prices.  Company Earnings  The rare-earth producer said this week it halted output at
some of its smelting units for one month as prices declined.  ZTE dropped 2 percent to 8.77 yuan, closing at its lowest
level since November 2008, after saying it swung to a third-
quarter net loss of 1.95 billion yuan from a profit of 299.3
million yuan a year earlier.  Hisense Electric dropped 1 yuan to 8.97 yuan. Third-quarter
profit declined 9.8 percent from a year earlier, the television
maker said late yesterday.  Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. cut its earnings-per-share
forecasts for the company for this year and 2013 by 12 percent
respectively as product prices fell and panel costs rose, Zhou Haichen, an analyst at the brokerage, wrote in a report today.  Corporate Profits  Out of the 937 companies in the Shanghai Composite, 293
have reported third-quarter earnings with an average drop of 3.3
percent from a year earlier, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. That compares with profit growth of 0.6 percent in
the second quarter, the data showed. Publicly traded companies
are required to release results by the end of the month.  Speculative “hot money” to  emerging markets  unleashed by
quantitative easing in the U.S. and  Europe  won’t likely flow to
the A-share market in large enough levels to push up share
prices, the China Securities Journal reported today, citing
unidentified analysts.  Net purchases of A shares by qualified foreign
institutional investors were 4.6 billion yuan last week, the
biggest weekly purchases of the year so far, the Guangzhou Daily
reported today, citing market data.  Hot Money  China may see moderate hot money inflows in the fourth
quarter, Ting Lu and Xiaojia Zhi, economists at Bank of America
Corp. said in a report to clients dated yesterday. They amended
their forecast for Chinese reserve-ratio reductions this year to
“at most” one cut from two because of the changing direction
of capital flows. The People’s Bank of  China  has cut interest
rates twice since early June and lowered reserve ratios three
times from last November.  China’s capital flight may decline on the recovering
economy, improved risk appetite, better liquidity, easing
concern about yuan depreciation, QE3 and policymakers’ efforts
to support financial market stability, the economists wrote.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 17.3
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 7.9
billion shares changed hands in the gauge, 2.6 percent higher
than the daily average in 2012.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 0.9 percent to $37.53
in its second day of gains in New York yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
