Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of  China ’s most-
used search-engine, said second-quarter profit rose 70 percent,
beating analysts’ estimates, as the company increased
advertising sales to new customers.  Net income climbed to 2.77 billion  yuan  ($434 million), or
7.86 yuan per American depositary receipt, compared with 1.63
billion yuan, or 4.67 yuan, a year earlier, Baidu said today in
a statement. That exceeded the 2.5 billion-yuan average of 10
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue rose 60
percent to 5.46 billion yuan.  Baidu added customers by stepping up marketing to smaller
companies in China, countering a slowdown in the advertising
market as economic growth weakens. Chief Executive Officer Robin Li is expanding in display advertising to customers including
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) , and plans to add mobile users as more
Chinese access the Web on smartphones.  “The smaller advertisers are helping the company,” Dick Wei, who rates Baidu overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Hong
Kong, said before the earnings release. Still, “it’s the bigger
customers who’ll drive growth,” Wei said.  Baidu fell 2.8 percent to close at $107.10 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading today before the announcement. The shares have
declined 8 percent this year, underperforming the 46 percent
gain in the Hong Kong-traded shares of  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ,
China’s biggest Internet company.  Third-quarter revenue will be in a range of 6.25 billion
yuan to 6.41 billion yuan, Baidu said. That compares with the
6.39 billion-yuan average of analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  In the second-quarter, Baidu accounted for 78.6 percent of
China’s search-engine market by revenue, compared with 15.7
percent for  Google Inc. (GOOG) , according to researcher Analysys
International.  China’s online advertising market may expand by 39 percent
this year to 65.1 billion yuan, slowing from 46 percent growth
in 2011, according to a report by Nomura Holdings Inc. in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
