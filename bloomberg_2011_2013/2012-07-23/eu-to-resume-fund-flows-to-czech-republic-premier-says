The European Union will resume
payments to some projects it finances in the  Czech Republic 
after problems in the programs were addressed, Prime Minister
Petr Necas said.  The EU asked Prague to take corrective measures in
management and control systems related to the use of its funds,
European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said in May. Johannes
Hahn, the EU commissioner for regional policy, told Necas today
that the bloc will restart payments into seven programs “in the
coming days,” the Czech premier said in an e-mailed statement.  The Czech public-finance deficit would double to as much as
6 percent of  economic output  if the 27-nation EU withheld all
payments to the projects that are co-financed by the state
budget, Necas said on May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
