U.S. stocks declined, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down for a second day, amid concern
Europe’s debt crisis is deepening and after a Chinese central-
bank adviser said the nation’s economic growth may slow further.  All 10  S&P 500  groups fell as commodity shares had the
biggest losses. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-
traded Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 2.1 percent.  McDonald’s (MCD) 
Corp. slid 2.9 percent as  profit  trailed estimates.  S&P 500 (SPXL1) 
futures expiring in September lost 0.4 percent to 1,338.30 at
5:53 p.m.  New York  time as Moody’s Investors Service lowered the
outlooks for Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  About  five stocks  fell for each rising on U.S. exchanges.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent to 1,350.52 at 4 p.m. in New York,
paring a loss of 1.8 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
dropped 101.11 points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,721.46. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index rose 14 percent to
18.62. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 6.4
billion shares, or 3.9 percent below the three-month average.  “Investors are on edge,” said  Russ Koesterich , the San
Francisco-based global chief investment strategist for the
IShares unit of BlackRock Inc. His firm oversees $3.56 trillion.
“Chinese growth has slowed. It’s not clear that the existing
firewalls in Europe are large enough. We knew the Spanish
regional governments had debt. The question is: how bad is it?”  Stocks fell as Spain’s 10-year bond yields rose to a euro-
era high on bets more of its regions will ask for aid. Greece’s
creditors meet this week, while German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s “very skeptical” European leaders will be
able to rescue the nation. A Chinese central bank adviser said
the country’s growth may cool to 7.4 percent this quarter.  ‘Rising Uncertainty’  After the market closed, Moody’s said it lowered Germany,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg’s Aaa credit rating outlooks to
negative, citing “rising uncertainty” about Europe’s debt
crisis. Risks that Greece may leave the 17-nation euro currency
and “increasing likelihood” of collective support for European
countries such as Spain and Italy were among reasons for the
change, Moody’s said today in a statement.  Concern about a global slowdown has led investors to a more
defensive stance since the S&P 500’s 2012 high in April. Phone,
utility, consumer staple and health-care companies were the only
ones to gain among 10 groups during that period. Financial
shares have slumped 11 percent, the most in the S&P 500.  The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index of companies most-tied
tied to the economy lost 1.2 percent today.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the
largest U.S. aluminum producer, slid 1.5 percent to $8.14.
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the biggest software maker, dropped 2.8 percent
to $29.28.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  fell 2.1 percent to $25.34.  Earnings Season  Investors also watched corporate results. Sales rose an
average 3 percent in the second quarter among 123 members of the
S&P 500 that have reported  results  so far, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Only 41 percent of the reported companies
have topped analysts’ estimates on sales, while 73 percent have
beaten on profit, the data show.  McDonald’s slipped 2.9 percent to $88.94. The restaurant
chain also said it may miss its full-year operating income
growth target. Chief Executive Officer  Don Thompson , who took
the helm earlier this month, has struggled to lure budget-
conscious Americans with a new extra-value menu. Sales at stores
open at least 13 months in the U.S. rose 3.6 percent, the
slowest growth in five quarters.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  retreated 1.8 percent to $16.07. The
company said it is eliminating about 1,300 jobs, or 2 percent of
the workforce, part of an effort to eliminate costs and
streamline decision making.  Apple’s Results  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  lost 0.1 percent to $603.83. The world’s largest
company by market value reports quarterly results tomorrow. With
a redesigned model probably arriving by October, analysts
estimate that sales of iPhones -- Apple’s biggest source of
revenue -- slid in the fiscal third quarter from prior periods.
While analysts predict that the next iPhone will be the best-
selling smartphone yet from Apple, the purchasing delays will
probably weigh down results until the device hits stores.  Facebook Inc. (FB)  dropped less than 0.1 percent to $28.75. The
biggest social-networking company reports results this week.
Sales probably rose  30 percent  to $1.16 billion in the June
period, according to analyst  predictions  compiled by Bloomberg.
That would be the slowest growth rate yet disclosed by the
company co-founded by  Mark Zuckerberg  in 2004.  Nine out of 11 stocks in a measure of homebuilders in S&P
indexes advanced. U.S. homebuilders are an attractive investment
as the housing market starts a “strong” recovery that may
drive a surge in new-home sales, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a report today.  KB Home (KBH)  added 3.6 percent to $10.16.
 PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  rose 1.4 percent to $11.01.  Higher Margins  Hasbro Inc. (HAS)  climbed 4 percent to $35.19. The world’s
second-largest toymaker reported second-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates as price increases boosted margins.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  rallied 2.4 percent to $31.51. The world’s
largest provider of hydraulic-fracturing services said
international sales climbed as the rig count and profit margin
grew in the Eastern Hemisphere.  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  rose 3.9 percent to $40.57. Its U.S. electrical
equipment sales rose ahead of the company’s expansion in the
industry through the acquisition of Cooper Industries Plc.  U.S. shares of  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  surged 52 percent to $25.90.
Cnooc Ltd. agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash for Calgary-based
Nexen in the biggest overseas acquisition by a Chinese company.  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  jumped 8.1 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $19.52. Its $1.7 billion agreement to buy  GenOn Energy
Inc. (GEN)  would create the largest U.S. independent electricity
generator with more market strength to withstand slumping power
prices. GenOn surged 26 percent to $2.29.  Other Deals  RailAmerica Inc. (RA)  advanced 9.8 percent to $27.25, the
highest since it went public in 2009. Genesee & Wyoming Inc.
agreed to  purchase  it for $1.39 billion to combine North
America’s two largest short-line and regional rail operators.  Peet’s Coffee & Tea Inc. (PEET)  gained 28 percent to $73.05. Joh.
A. Benckiser agreed to buy Peet’s, giving the closely held
German holding company about 190 specialty cafes in the U.S. and
access to an expanding grocery business.  Better-than-forecast earnings are masking weaker sales
growth in the most recent quarter as U.S. companies improve
margins to top estimates.  The gap in results signals companies may hold off hiring
and expanding until demand rebounds globally. Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers last week that progress
in reducing unemployment may be “frustratingly slow” with
joblessness stuck above 8 percent since February 2009.  Lower Forecasts  Analysts have lowered predictions for profit and revenue in
recent months. For earnings, they estimate a 1.6 percent decline
on average among all S&P 500 members after anticipating a 0.5
percent increase in May. Revenue may rise 1.8 percent on
average, down from a 3.7 percent estimate in May.  “People are sitting on the sidelines right now waiting to
see what happens,” Verizon Communications Inc. Chief Financial
Officer Fran Shammo said in a telephone interview last week
after the New York-based company reported in-line second-quarter
profit and sales. “This isn’t helping with growth, so I think
we will continue to mosey along here in the states.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
