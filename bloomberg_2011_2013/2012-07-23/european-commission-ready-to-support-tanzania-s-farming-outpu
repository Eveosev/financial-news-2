The European Commission is “ready
to support” a program intended to triple agriculture production
in Tanzania, according to European Union Commission President
 Jose Barroso .  The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania aims
to use $2.1 billion of private investment, and $1.3 billion
public grants and loans to bring 350,000 hectares (864,869
acres) into profitable agricultural production, according to
information on its website. Tanzania grows cereals, mainly rice
for domestic consumption, and for exports coffee, tea, cashew
nuts, tobacco and cotton.  For the seven years beginning 2014, the European Commission
expects to approve more than 600 million euros ($727 million) of
funds to support Tanzania, Andris Piebalgs, the EU’s
commissioner for development, said in an interview last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
