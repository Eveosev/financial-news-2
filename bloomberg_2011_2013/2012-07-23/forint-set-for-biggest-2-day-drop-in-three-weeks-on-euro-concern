The forint had the biggest two-day
decline in more than two weeks on concern the  European debt
crisis  is deepening.  The currency of  Hungary , the European Union’s most indebted
eastern member, depreciated 0.6 percent to 287.87 per euro by
5:06 p.m. in Budapest, bringing its loss in the past two days to
1.3 percent, the most since the two days through July 6. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  slipped 2.3 percent to 16,956.07, the
most since June 25.  Greece’s troika of international creditors -- the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the International
Monetary Fund -- are due to arrive in Athens tomorrow amid
doubts the country will meet its commitments and reluctance
among euro-area states to put up more funds should it fail. Six
Spanish regions may ask for aid from the central government, El
Pais reported. Spain and Italy reinstated a short-sale ban on
stocks as bank shares plunged.  “The resurfacing of the Greek euro exit scenario and the
concern over the Spanish regions also depressed sentiment on the
forint market, the Hungarian currency has markedly weakened over
the past two days,” Levente Blaho and Adam Keszeg, analysts at
 Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , wrote in a research report
today.  Hungary is due to complete the first round of talks on a
bailout from the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
