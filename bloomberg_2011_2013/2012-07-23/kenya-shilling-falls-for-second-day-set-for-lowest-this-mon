Kenya’s shilling fell for a second
day against the dollar, heading for its weakest level in more
than three weeks as month-end demand starts building up and
concern increased of a renewed crisis in the euro area.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy dropped 0.2
percent to 84.32 a dollar by 12:24 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.
A close at that level would be the lowest since June 28,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The  market sentiment  is turning toward a weaker shilling
partly due to end-month demand and also because there are fears
about the news coming out of the Eurozone so people in  emerging
markets  like Kenya start exiting the market because of  risk
aversion ,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of trading at Commercial Bank
of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  A surge in Spanish bond yields dimmed the outlook for a bill
sale tomorrow before Greece’s creditors meet this week amid
doubts the country will meet bailout commitments. The
 International Monetary Fund  will stop paying further rescue aid
to Greece, making the country’s insolvency in September more
likely, Der Spiegel magazine said yesterday, citing unidentified
European Union officials.  “The shilling is expected to be under pressure this week
as month-end dollar demand especially from the oil and energy
sector is expected,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said today in
an e-mailed note.  Uganda’s currency weakened 0.2 percent to 2,468.95 per
dollar dollar, while Tanzania’s currency depreciated 0.4 percent
to 1,589.50, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
