CME Group Inc. (CME) , the world’s largest
futures market, said it’s considering a plan to house all
customer funds at clearinghouses or other depositories after
futures investors have lost money held at  MF Global Holdings
Ltd. (MFGLQ)  and Peregrine Financial Group Inc.  The exchange operator said any interest earned by the
customer money would be returned to the futures brokerages to
maintain a key feature of how the firms earn revenue, according
to a letter to customers sent today by Executive Chairman
 Terrence Duffy  and Chief Executive Officer Phupinder Gill.  “While these firms may have been at fault, it’s
nevertheless our problem as an industry, and this problem needs
a solution,” they wrote in the letter. Customers at MF Global
are still missing $1.6 billion in segregated funds after the
firm filed for bankruptcy in October.  About $220 million in segregated client money is
unaccounted for at Peregrine after its founder and Chief
Executive Officer Russell Wasendorf Sr. was arrested July 13
after a suicide attempt and a signed confession that he had
defrauded customers for 20 years.  In both cases, the excess customer money held at the
brokerages is what disappeared. The customer funds held by CME
Group in the MF Global case and at Jefferies Group Inc. in the
Peregrine situation were protected.  “CME Group is appalled by the recent misuse of segregated
funds by two firms,” according to the letter from Chicago-based
CME Group. “There has never been anything like it in the
history of the futures industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
