Coffee-growing areas in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer of the commodity, will get mostly dry
and warm weather through July 27, according to Sao Paulo-based
weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia.  “The weather changes only in the southern Parana and  Sao
Paulo , due to a cold front that reaches the Parana, in the
middle of the week, but cannot advance further north,” Marcio
Custodio, forecast operating director at the company, said in a
report e-mailed today.  Minas Gerais  is Brazil’s biggest arabica-
producing state, while Espirito Santo is the largest producer of
the robusta variety, used in instant drinks and espresso.  Above-average rainfall last month delayed harvesting and
resulted in a fall in production of higher quality beans,
Escritorio Carvalhaes, a Santos, Brazil-based broker, said in an
e-mailed report dated July 20.  “The uncertainty over the volume of good quality coffees
that will be produced in Brazil this year have resulted in
growers delaying the sales of their better beans from the new
season,” Escritorio Carvalhaes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
