Serbian lawmakers elected Nebojsa
Stefanovic as parliamentary speaker today, paving the way for a
new Cabinet to be sworn in almost three months after general
elections.  The 36-year-old Stefanovic, a member of President Tomislav Nikolic’s Progressive Party, was backed by 142 lawmakers in the
250-seat legislature. The Progressives and the Socialists of
Prime Minister-Designate Ivica Dacic, have partnered with the
United Regions of Finance Minister-Designate Mladjan Dinkic and
the  Social Democratic Party  of former Labor Minister Rasim Ljajic. The coalition has 140 seats.  The new government, due to be sworn in by July 27, brings
the Socialists back into power for the first time since the
ousting of the party’s founder,  Slobodan Milosevic , who is
blamed for fomenting the 1990s Balkan civil wars that destroyed
the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
