Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index headed for the biggest two-day loss in
seven weeks, after a Chinese central bank adviser forecast
economic growth will slow further and on renewed concern that
Greece may not meet its bailout targets.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , which gets 47 percent of its
revenue in China and Europe, lost 2.4 percent in Seoul.  HSBC
Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank, slumped 5.7 percent, its
biggest drop since November.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No.
1 mining company, lost 2.6 percent in Sydney amid concern about
global economic growth. Gauges of volatility in Asia rose,
reflecting increasing risk aversion among investors.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.9 percent to 114.48 as
of 5:20 p.m. in Tokyo, erasing last week’s advance, as all 10
industry groups on the gauge retreated and 10 stocks dropped for
each that gained. The measure is headed for a two-day loss of
2.6 percent, the biggest since June 4.  “There are many global macro headwinds,” said George Boubouras, Melbourne-based head of investment strategy at UBS
AG’s Australian unit. The Swiss bank has about $1.5 trillion in
assets under management. “ Risk aversion  persists for many
investors. Cautious corporate guidance remains, given the many
different macro and political challenges.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 9.5 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 29 through last week amid concern China’s
economy is slowing and Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will
worsen. The regional benchmark trades at 11.8 times  estimated
earnings , compared with 13.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 10.8 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Regional Fall  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  fell 3 percent, the biggest
drop since May 16, while China’s Shanghai Composite Index
retreated 1.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average declined
1.9 percent as the yen reached an 11-year high against the euro,
weighing on the nation’s exporters. South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI) 
slid 1.8 percent, and  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  lost 1.7
percent.  Volatility across the region rose. The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI) 
climbed 18 percent to 22.19, the most since May, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 5.3 percent in the Hong Kong
benchmark over the next 30 days. Volatility gauges for Japan’s
Nikkei 225 and Korea’s Kospi 200 Index also advanced.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell 0.8 percent today. The gauge
dropped 1 percent in New York on July 20, the biggest loss since
June 25.  Chinese Growth  Samsung led declines among exporters to China and Europe
after Song Guoqing, an academic member of the People’s Bank of
China monetary policy committee, predicted the nation’s
expansion may cool to 7.4 percent this quarter. The adviser to
the central bank also warned that a drop in producer prices in
tandem with consumer inflation may hurt investment returns of
industrial companies.  Samsung fell 2.4 percent to 1.162 million won in Seoul.
HSBC tumbled 5.7 percent to HK$63.10 in  Hong Kong . Machinery
maker  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , which generates 24 percent of its revenue in

Ltd. fell 3.1 percent to HK$10.82 and  Agile Property Holdings
Ltd. (3383)  dropped 2.8 percent to HK$9.90 in Hong Kong.  In Europe, Greece is back at the heart of the region’s debt
crisis as policy makers arrive in Athens tomorrow amid doubts
the country will meet its commitments and reluctance among euro-
area states to issue more funds should it fail.  “If Greece doesn’t fulfill those conditions, then there
can be no more payments,” German Vice Chancellor Philipp
Roesler told broadcaster ARD.  Oil Drops  Resources and energy companies fell amid concern about the
global economic slowdown. Japan’s government is seeing increased
signs of a weakening global expansion, the Cabinet Office said
today.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $2.06 to
$89.77 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  today.  BHP Billiton  slid 2.6 percent to A$30.55 in Sydney.  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , China’s largest offshore energy explorer, lost 3.1 percent
to HK$15.44 in Hong Kong.  China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. slumped 10 percent to
HK$24.20 in Hong Kong on a share sale plan. Carlyle Holdings
Mauritius Ltd. and Parallel Investors Holdings Ltd. are selling
220 million shares in the insurer for HK$25.50 to HK$26 each,
according to terms for the sale obtained by Bloomberg News.

closing price on July 20.  Among the 1,007 companies listed on the MSCI Asia Pacific
