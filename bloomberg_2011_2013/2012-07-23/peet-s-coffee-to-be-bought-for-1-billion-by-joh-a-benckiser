Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Inc. (PEET)  agreed to
be acquired by Joh. A. Benckiser for about $1 billion, giving
the closely held company about 190 specialty cafes in the U.S.
and access to an expanding grocery business.  The offer of $73.50 per share is 29 percent more than
Peet’s closing price of $57.16 on July 20, Emeryville,
California-based Peet’s said today in a statement. The
transaction is expected to be completed in about three months,
the companies said.  While Peet’s  profit  has been hurt recently by surging
coffee prices and increased competition, sales in its grocery
business have increased. The company began selling Godiva brand
coffees in grocery and drug stores in 2009 to establish a bigger
retail presence, especially in flavored coffees.  Peet’s surged 29 percent to $73.68 at 10:09 a.m. in  New
York , indicating shareholders may expect a higher offer. The
shares, which reached $77.60 in March, had dropped 8.8 percent
this year through July 20.  Peet’s was founded by Alfred Peet in Berkeley,  California ,
in 1966, five years before  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  was started in
 Seattle  in 1971. Peet mentored Starbucks’ co-founder Gerald
Baldwin, who later bought Peet’s and sold the Starbucks chain.
Baldwin was Peet’s chief executive officer for about 23 years
and serves as a board member.  Citigroup Inc. acted as the exclusive financial adviser to
Peet’s and provided a fairness opinion to the board, while
Cooley LLP served as legal adviser. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &
Flom LLP  provided legal counsel to JAB on this transaction,
while Morgan Stanley and BDT & Company served as financial
advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
