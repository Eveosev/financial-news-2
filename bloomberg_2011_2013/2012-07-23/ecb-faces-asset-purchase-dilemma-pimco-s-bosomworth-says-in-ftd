Targeted asset purchases by the
 European Central Bank  to combat deflation risks would pose
difficulties in implementation,  Andrew Bosomworth , Pacific
Investment Management Co.’s Germany director, wrote in the
 Financial Times Deutschland .  Central bank purchases of government bonds in line with the
ECB’s capital key would have limited effect, as about a quarter
would be invested in German bunds, some of which already have
negative yields, Bosomworth said.  Purchases of Spanish or Italian bonds alone, on the other
hand, would confuse markets as to the ECB’s intentions, he said.
Europe needs to have a discussion about how to implement such
steps, either through the ECB or through the permanent bailout
fund, Bosomworth added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
