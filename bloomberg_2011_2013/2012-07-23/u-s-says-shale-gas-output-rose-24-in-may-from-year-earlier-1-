Natural-gas production from shale
formations rose in May on increased supplies from the Marcellus
deposit even after prices fell to a 10-year low, Energy
Department data show.  Total output from shale formations in the continental U.S.
averaged 25.58 billion cubic feet a day in May, 24 percent
higher than a year earlier and up 1.7 percent from April,
according to slides that accompany a presentation the department
will make to Congress Aug. 1. Shale production has gained 5.7
percent this year.  Production from shale deposits with oil and other liquids
has gained as dry-gas output has declined in response to decade-
low prices, the department said in its  Short-Term Energy Outlook 
on July 10. Gas futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange
dropped to $1.902 per million British thermal units April 19.  May output from the Marcellus shale in the eastern U.S.
averaged 6.85 bcf a day, up 6.4 percent from the previous month
and gained 28 percent during the first five months of the year.
May 2011 production averaged 3.37 bcf daily.  Haynesville shale output in Louisiana and  Texas  averaged
6.92 bcf a day, down from 6.93 billion in April. Production from
the region has declined 2.4 percent this year. Output averaged
6.43 billion cubic feet a day in May 2011.  Barnett Output  Output at the Barnett shale in Texas was 4.67 bcf daily,
from 4.66 billion in April, department data show. Production
dropped 1.7 percent versus May 2011.  The average for Eagle Ford shale gas output in southern
Texas was 1.52 billion cubic feet a day in May, up from 1.51
billion the previous month. Production has gained 6.3 percent
this year. Output averaged 820 million cubic feet a day a year
ago.  Woodford shale output in  Oklahoma  averaged 1.14 billion
cubic feet a day in May, up from 1.13 billion both in April and
during May 2011. Fayetteville production in  Arkansas  declined
1.1 percent this year to 2.68 billion cubic feet a day. Output
averaged 2.69 billion in April and 2.54 billion in May 2011.  Bakken gas output in  North Dakota  held steady at 190
million cubic feet a day in May versus the previous month.
Production is up 19 percent from a year earlier. Gas from the
Antrim shale in Michigan, Indiana and  Ohio  averaged 290 million
cubic feet a day in May, unchanged versus April and May 2011.  Gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
climbed 3.6 cents, or 1.2 percent, today to $3.117 per million
Btus, the highest settlement price since Dec. 22. Gas is up 4.3
percent this year on increased demand from power generators that
switched from costlier coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
