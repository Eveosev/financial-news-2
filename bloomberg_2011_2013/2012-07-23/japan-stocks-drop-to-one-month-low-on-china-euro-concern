Japan ’s Topix Index posted its
biggest two-day decline of the year as a Chinese central bank
board member warned of slowing growth, and the yen rose to a 11-
year high against the euro amid concern Greece may exit the
currency bloc, hurting the outlook for exporters.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction machinery that gets
14 percent of its sales in  China , fell 3.3 percent.  Ricoh Co. (7752) , a
producer of  office equipment  that counts on  Europe  for 21
percent of revenue, retreated 7 percent.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) 
paced declines in the sector on a report the company will
probably report an 80 percent fall in first-quarter profit.  The Topix fell 1.8 percent to 720.62 at the 3 p.m. trading
close in  Tokyo , capping the biggest two-day drop since September.
The benchmark  Nikkei 255 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 1.9 percent to
8,508.32, with trading volume 9.5 percent below the 30-day
average. Shares fell on increased signs of a weakening global
expansion that may weigh on a Japanese economy dependent on
reconstruction from last year’s earthquake, the Cabinet said in
a monthly report today.  “There’s a lot of bad news to start the week with,” David
Gaud, a senior portfolio manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset
Management in  Hong Kong , said on Bloomberg Television. “The
markets are facing a lot of negative news, a lot of uncertainty
from Europe. Second quarter GDP in China was probably a little
below what official numbers are stating.”  Stocks fell on expectations China’s economic expansion may
cool for a seventh straight quarter to 7.4 percent in the three
months through September, according to Song Guoqing, an academic
member of the People’s Bank of China monetary policy committee.  Komatsu fell 3.3 percent to 1,655 yen. Taiyo Yuden Co., a
maker of electronic parts that gets 30 percent of sales in China,
slid 5.3 percent to 640 yen.  Europe Stocks  Companies linked to Europe declined after the common
currency touched 94.91 yen, the lowest since 2000. German Vice
Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s “very skeptical” that
European leaders will be able to rescue  Greece , whose creditors
will assess this week how far off course the country is from
bailout targets.  Ricoh fell 7 percent to 529 yen. Sony Corp., a consumer-
electronics company that gets about 20 percent of its sales in
Europe, fell 4.1 percent to 919 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest maker of cameras, fell 4.6 percent to 2,742 yen on
expectations shares may fall 20 percent in the next 12 months
without changes to operations and leadership, Barron’s reported.  The Topix has fallen 17 percent from this year’s peak in
March as growth slowed in the U.S. and China, and concern
mounted about Europe’s debt crisis.  Shares on the equity gauge are valued at 0.9 times  book
value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.4 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means
investors can buy companies for less than the value of their
assets.  S&P Declines  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.5 percent today. The gauge
dropped 1 percent in New York on July 20, the biggest loss since
June 25, as commodities sank on news China will not relax
property control policies.  Steelmakers declined on concern slowing global growth will
cut earnings. Nippon Steel lost 2 percent to 151 yen on a Nikkei
newspaper report that its fiscal first-quarter profit will drop
80 percent from a year earlier. JFE Holdings Inc. declined 3.1
percent to 1,025 yen after the Nikkei reported profit dropped
about 60 percent over the same period.  Financial stocks slid after the credit grades of Japan’s
three biggest lenders were cut by  Fitch Ratings , which cited the
government’s weakened ability to support the banking system.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan’s largest bank, fell
2.5 percent to 359 yen, Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. retreated
2.4 percent to 121 yen, while Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group
Inc. declined 2.9 percent to 2,372 yen.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  surged 21 percent to 21.31,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.1 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. That’s the biggest jump
since May 18. Trading volume on the gauge was 22 percent below
the 100-day average.
