Singapore ’s  City Harvest  Church
doubled its stake in a downtown convention center last year to
39.2 percent for an additional S$54 million ($43 million).  The church bought 19.2 percent of Suntec International
Convention & Exhibition Centre for the amount, Executive Pastor
Aries Zulkarnain said at a church service on July 21. City
Harvest first invested less than S$44 million for 20 percent of
the convention center in 2010, he said. The property is partly
owned by Suntec REIT, which said in October it has a 60.8
percent effective stake.  “To put it simply, we are co-owners of this property,”
Zulkarnain told the congregation at the convention center.  The increased stake was disclosed a month after Kong Hee,
the founder and senior pastor of the church, was charged with
four officers in Singapore’s Subordinate Court with conspiracy
to misuse S$50.6 million of the church’s funds. City Harvest
denied allegations it was cheated and said it’s standing by them.  Suntec REIT (SUN)  announced a S$180 million plan in October to
upgrade the convention center, with work scheduled to start in
mid-2012. Yeo See Kiat, chief executive officer of the
management company of Suntec REIT, couldn’t immediately be
reached for a comment.  In April 2010, City Harvest proposed in a  notice  to its
members to spend S$310 million for a stake in the convention
center, as well as rents and renovation costs related to the use
of that space for its services.  Zulkarnain said at the service Suntec REIT’s asset
enhancement plan will “increase the value of the property
further.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
