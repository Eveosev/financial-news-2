Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi
will announce a new government by July 26, the Muslim
Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party said.  “The new prime minister will be a patriotic figure who is
accepted by all political forces,” the party said on its
Facebook page late yesterday, citing unidentified officials
close to the presidency.  Mursi, a former FJP leader who was the Muslim Brotherhood’s
candidate for president, promised to choose a premier from
outside the Islamist group. Candidates tipped for the job by
local newspapers have included Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive
officer of Pacific Investment Management Co.; former central
bank Governor Mahmoud Abul-Eyoun; the bank’s current governor,
Farouk al-Okdah; and Hazem Beblawi, a former deputy prime
minister and finance minister.  El-Erian said last week that he hasn’t been offered the job
and wouldn’t accept it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
