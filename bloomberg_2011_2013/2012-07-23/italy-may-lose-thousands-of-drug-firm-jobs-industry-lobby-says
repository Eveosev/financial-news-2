Drug companies in Italy may
eliminate thousands of jobs due to government spending cuts,
including those introduced this month by Prime Minister  Mario Monti , according to a trade group and labor unions.  “The consequences for companies are clear: disinvestment,
delocalization and a worsening of crises and restructurings,”
said Antonio Messina, a delegate of Farmindustria, and Alberto
Morselli, general secretary of the FILCTEM-CGIL union, in an
open letter to Monti today. “Further crises will inevitably
come, with employment consequences in the near future for
thousands of workers.”  Monti is pushing to tame Italy’s deficit and lower the
country’s borrowing costs. On July 6, his Cabinet approved 26
billion euros ($31.5 billion) of spending reductions over the
next three years. Labor unions and Farmindustria, an association
whose members include units of  Merck & Co. (MRK)  and  Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) ,
are urging Monti to ease cutbacks on pharmaceutical spending
before the package passes parliament.  “These measures pose a particular risk to producers of
pharmaceuticals and medical devices,” said  Wolfango Piccoli , an
analyst with Eurasia Group in London, in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
