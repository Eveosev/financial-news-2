The  New York Yankees  lost to the
Oakland Athletics 5-4 in 12 innings for their fourth consecutive
one-run defeat in the four-game series.  Coco Crisp delivered the winning run-scoring single in the
bottom of the 12th inning yesterday in Oakland, California,
after Seth Smith had tied the game for the A’s with a solo home
run in the ninth inning.  The Athletics have now won a Major League Baseball-best 11
games in their final at-bat this season.  They have a 14-2 record in July, including five wins in a
row, and are 51-44 overall and in third place in the American
League West Division. The AL East-leading Yankees, who were
swept in a four-game series for the first time since 2003, still
have baseball’s best record at 57-38.  Miguel Cabrera  of the Detroit Tigers hit two home runs in a
6-4 win over the Chicago White Sox yesterday to become the 22nd
active major leaguer with at least 300 career homers.  The Tigers had four homers to cap a three-game series sweep
that leaves them 1 1/2 games ahead of the White Sox atop the
American League Central Division. Detroit has won 13 of its past
15 games.  Cabrera, 29, becomes the youngest active member of the 300-
home run club. The seven-time All-Star third baseman now has 23
homers this season and has hit at least 30 home runs in seven of
the past eight seasons.  The Los Angeles Angels beat the Texas Rangers 7-4 as  Albert Pujols  hit his 18th home run of the season, while the Toronto
Blue Jays hit four homers in a 15-7 rout of the  Boston Red Sox .  Ryan Zimmerman  hit a pair of home runs as the Washington
Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves 9-2 to improve their National
League-best record to 55-39.  The  Los Angeles Dodgers  scored five runs in the 12th inning
to beat the  New York  Mets 8-3 and send the Mets to their ninth
loss in 10 games. At 47-48, the Mets now have a losing record
for the first time this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
