Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  will expand into
 East Africa  with the acquisition of interests in two Kenyan
exploration projects.  Marathon will pay $35 million to  Africa Oil Corp. (AOI)  for 50
percent in  Kenya ’s Block 9 and 15 percent in Block 12A, Africa
Oil said today in a statement. It will also contribute as much
as $43.5 million to Africa Oil’s exploration expenditure over
the next three years.  The companies have also “agreed to jointly pursue
exploration activities on an additional exploration area in
Ethiopia,” Africa Oil said.  Marathon, based in Houston, so far has been active in the
West African nations of  Equatorial Guinea , Gabon and Angola. It
also has some interests in  Libya  in North Africa.  At the same time,  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  has increased its stake in
Block 12A to 65 percent from the earlier  50 percent  share,
Africa Oil said, which now holds 20 percent in the venture.  Separately, Africa Oil sold 25 percent in Block 7 and Block
8 in Ethiopia to New Age (African Global Energy) Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
