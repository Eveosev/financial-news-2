Pennon Group Plc (PNN) , a U.K. water
provider, said its Viridor unit won a 25-year waste treatment
services contract with Glasgow for the recycling and treatment
of the Scottish city’s municipal waste.  A capital investment of about 160 million pounds ($248
million) will be required by Viridor, to be paid with internal
funds, to build and operate a new recycling and renewable energy
facility to treat residual waste in the south of the city, the
company said today in a statement.  Pennon, whose shares have risen almost 10 percent over the
past year, is based in Exeter. Colin Drummond, chief executive
officer of Viridor, said the company will work with Glasgow to
maximize heat-recovery opportunities at the local facilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
