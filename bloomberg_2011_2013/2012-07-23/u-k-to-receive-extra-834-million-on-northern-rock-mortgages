The U.K. government will receive a
further 538 million pounds ($834 million) from the sale of
mortgages and  Northern Rock  Plc to Virgin Money Holdings (U.K.)
Ltd.  The Treasury sold 465 million pounds of Northern Rock
(Asset Management) Plc mortgages to Virgin Money, U.K. Financial
Investments Ltd. said in a statement today. Virgin also paid 73
million pounds in addition to 747 million pounds previously
agreed for the acquisition of Northern Rock Plc, based on a
final valuation of assets, UKFI said.  “These transactions are consistent with UKFI’s objective
to manage the government’s investments commercially and to
create and protect value for the taxpayer as shareholder,” said
Keith Morgan, head of wholly owned investments at UKFI, which
manages the government’s bank stakes.  Northern Rock was nationalized in February 2008 after
suffering the first run on a U.K. bank in more than a century.
Virgin Money agreed to buy Northern Rock Plc in November,
leaving the taxpayer with stakes in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc ,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and other mortgage assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
