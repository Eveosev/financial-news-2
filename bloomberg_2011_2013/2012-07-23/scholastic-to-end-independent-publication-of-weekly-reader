Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) , the publisher
behind  Harry Potter  and the Hunger Games, plans to discontinue
separate issues of its  Weekly Reader  magazines after more than a
century of publication.  The magazines will be co-branded with Scholastic classroom
publications starting this school year, Kyle Good, a spokeswoman
for the New York-based company, said in an e-mail today.  Scholastic bought Weekly Reader from Readers Digest
Association Inc. in February. Co-branded titles under the new
format will include Junior Scholastic/Current Events and
Scholastic News/Weekly Reader.  Scholastic Classroom Magazines 
have been in circulation for more than 90 years and reach 25
million students.  “We are confident that the combined Scholastic News/Weekly
Reader team will now offer an even better supplemental news and
information experience,” Good said.  Good and Cathy Lasiewicz, another Scholastic spokeswoman,
couldn’t confirm how many employees from  White Plains , New York-
based Weekly Reader will lose their jobs. The  New York  Post
 reported  earlier today that Weekly Reader would cease
publication and that 55 of 60 of its employees in White Plains
would be fired.  Some Weekly Reader employees are working at Scholastic,
others are being considered for positions and some aren’t
interested in commuting to Scholastic offices, Good said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
