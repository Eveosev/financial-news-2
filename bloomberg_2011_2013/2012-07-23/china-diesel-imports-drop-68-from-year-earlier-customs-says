China increased gasoline exports to
the highest level in three months in June as the nation’s
domestic demand fell to the lowest since March.  Net exports, or overseas sales minus imports, of the motor
fuel almost doubled to 261,997 metric tons last month compared
with May, customs data showed today. Apparent demand, which
includes domestic production and excludes stockpiles, was at 1.9
million barrels a day, down 0.8 percent from a month earlier.  “The rainy season in May and June curbed gasoline use and
the refiners wanted to lower their inventory,” Liao Kaishun, an
analyst with C1 Energy said by telephone from Guangzhou.
“Exports may drop in the following months as summer is usually
a peak consumption season.”  Net imports of  fuel oil  slid 13 percent to 220,133 barrels
a day last month from May, today’s data showed. Apparent demand
declined for a fourth month by 9 percent to 522,339 barrels a
day. That’s the lowest level since January, when consumption was
curbed by the weeklong Chinese Lunar New Year holiday.  The commodity is used as ship fuel and as feedstock for
private refineries to produce gasoline and diesel. The so-called
teapot plants, located mostly in Shandong province, cut
operating rates to 25.7 percent of their designed capacity in
the week to June 28, the lowest since April 2010, according to
 Oilchem.net , an industry website.  China remained a net importer of diesel in June, with
103,189 tons of imports and 76,618 tons of exports, today’s data
showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
