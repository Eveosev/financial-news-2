New Zealand â€™s central bank should
hold the official cash rate at a record-low 2.5 percent at the
July 26 review, according to the majority of a nine-member panel
of economists, academics and company executives.  Seven of the shadow board set up by the New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research Inc. said Governor Alan Bollard
should leave the rate unchanged, the Wellington-based institute
said in an e-mailed statement. Two members prefer a rate cut.  All 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no
change in borrowing costs until next year. A government report
last week showed annual inflation was the weakest in more than
12 years, while an institute survey July 7 showed business
confidence fell in the second quarter.  The shadow board members indicate where they think  interest
rates  should be, not what they expect will happen, the institute
said. Across the panel, there is slightly less appetite for
lower rates than in the June 12 outlook, with the weighted
average preference for a cut falling to 31 percent from 34
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
