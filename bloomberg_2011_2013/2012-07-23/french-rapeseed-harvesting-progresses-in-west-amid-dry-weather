Rapeseed harvesting in the west of
 France  is progressing amid dry weather, with yields ranging from
acceptable to “rather good,” oilseed-industry researcher
Cetiom reported.  The harvest is almost completed in the Poitou-Charentes
region, where the average yield should exceed 3.5 metric tons
per hectare (2.47 acres), the Paris-based researcher wrote in a
 report  on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
