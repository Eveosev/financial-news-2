The U.S. Olympic men’s basketball
team beat Argentina 86-80 in its second-to-last exhibition game
before the London Games as  Kevin Durant  scored 27 points.  Durant, of the National Basketball Association’s Oklahoma
City Thunder, hit 7 of 11 three-point shots for the U.S., which
raced to a 16-1 advantage and led by 20 points with 3:01 left in
the third quarter yesterday in Barcelona.  Manu Ginobili of the San Antonio Spurs helped Argentina
pull within four points, 78-74, with 2:50 left before Durant
made his seventh three-pointer to help the U.S. hold on for the
victory.  Kobe Bryant  of the Los Angeles Lakers added 18 points
for the defending gold medal winners, while  LeBron James  of the
Miami Heat had 15 points and seven rebounds.  “We started off pretty well,” Durant said in comments
distributed by USA Basketball. “ Argentina  did a great job of
slowing the game down, making the right passes and penetrating
and executing. So it was a good game for us. We learned a lot.”  The U.S. improved to 4-0 on its pre-Olympics tour and will
play Spain tomorrow in Barcelona, the site of the gold medal
performance by the so-called “Dream Team” at the 1992
Olympics. The Americans wore 1992 USA Basketball retro jerseys
in yesterday’s game, which was a preview of a Aug. 6 preliminary
game against Argentina at the London Olympics.  The U.S. opens its  preliminary round schedule  July 29
against France before facing Tunisia, Nigeria, Lithuania and
then Argentina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
