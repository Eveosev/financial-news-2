The Nigerian central bank’s Monetary
Policy Committee will announce the outcome of its two-day
meeting tomorrow.  In May, the committee kept its  benchmark interest rate 
unchanged at a record 12 percent for a fourth consecutive
meeting to bolster the naira and curb an inflation rate at an
18-month high.  Zambia ’s central bank will today decide when its monetary
policy committee will meet. The Bank of Zambia last month left
its benchmark rate unchanged at 9 percent for a third straight
time as inflation in  Africa ’s biggest copper-producing nation
accelerated.
