Public Bank Bhd. (PBK) ,  Malaysia ’s third-
biggest lender, said second-quarter profit was little changed as
market competition narrowed interest margins.  Net income  fell 0.2 percent to 952.7 million ringgit ($300
million), or 27.2 sen a share, in the three months ended June
30, from a restated 954.9 million ringgit, or 27.27 sen a share,
a year earlier, the lender said in an exchange filing today.
Revenue rose 9.3 percent to 3.47 billion ringgit.  “Competition is expected to intensify for loans and
deposits and net interest margin will continue to be impacted,”
Chairman Teh Hong Piow said in a statement. “The group is
expected to maintain its earnings momentum and record
satisfactory performance in the second half of 2012.”  Shares of Kuala Lumpur-based Public Bank were unchanged at
14.32 ringgit as of 3:34 p.m. local time. The stock has advanced
7 percent this year.  Net interest income, or revenue from borrowers after
deducting interest paid to depositors, climbed 4.6 percent last
quarter to 1.3 billion ringgit. Net income from Islamic banking
shrank 7.1 percent to 211.2 million ringgit, the filing showed.  Other operating expenses increased 7.5 percent to 594
million ringgit, while allowances for impairment on loans rose
29 percent to 83.6 million ringgit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
