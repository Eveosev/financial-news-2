The medical campus where the man
accused in the Aurora, Colorado, theater killings was a graduate
student received two suspicious packages, said Lilly Marks, an
executive vice chancellor at the University of Colorado-Denver.  Authorities didn’t say whether either package could be
linked to James Holmes. The university is inventorying all
laboratories to see whether dangerous chemicals are missing, she
said.  Marks spoke at a news conference in Aurora.  To contact the reporter on this story:
