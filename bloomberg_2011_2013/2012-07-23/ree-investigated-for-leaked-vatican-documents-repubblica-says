Vatican  prosecutors are
investigating three people including a housekeeper of  Pope
Benedict XVI  and two prelates as part of a probe on confidential
documents leaked to an Italian journalist, la Repubblica
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The three may be accomplices of the pontiff’s butler Paolo
Gabriele who was arrested on May 26 on suspicion of “aggravated
theft,” the Rome-based newspaper said.  Gabriele was last week released from custody and placed
under house arrest pending a decision on whether he will stand
trial, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said in a July
21 statement.  A lawyer for Gabriele said he hadn’t been paid by anyone to
remove documents from the Vatican, Ansa news agency reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
