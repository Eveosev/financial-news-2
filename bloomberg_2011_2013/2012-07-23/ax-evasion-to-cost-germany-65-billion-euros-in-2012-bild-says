Tax evasion will cost Germany about
65 billion euros ($79 billion) in lost revenue this year,  Bild 
reported, citing studies by  Friedrich Schneider  at the Johannes
Kepler University in Linz, Austria.  About 50 billion euros in revenue will be lost from off-
the-books income and as much as 15 billion euros from undeclared
investment outside Germany, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
