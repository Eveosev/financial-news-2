SolarWorld AG (SWV)  said its lenders
agreed to relax terms on 375 million euros ($454 million) of
loans as  Germany ’s biggest solar-panel maker faces a
“challenging market situation.”  SolarWorld sought the changes as worsening conditions in
the solar industry increased the Bonn-based company’s risk of
missing its financial covenants in the second quarter, it said
in a statement today.  SolarWorld had 320 million euros of liquid funds at the end
of June and has paid off more than 130 million euros of its
loans, Chief Financial Officer Philipp Koecke said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
