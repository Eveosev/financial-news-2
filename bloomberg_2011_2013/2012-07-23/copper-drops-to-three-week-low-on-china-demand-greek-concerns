Copper fell to the lowest level in
more than three weeks as industrial metals slid on concerns that
demand in  China  may drop and Greece may exit the euro.  Three-month metal declined as much as 1.2 percent to
$7,451.50 a metric ton, the lowest level since June 29, on the
London Metal Exchange and traded at $7,453.25 a ton at 2:49 p.m.
Shanghai time. November-delivery metal on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 2.6 percent to 54,440  yuan  ($8,522) a ton.  “Copper is facing challenges to climb further, given
lackluster demand in China and resurfacing concerns over
 Europe ’s debt crisis,” Zhang Yu, an analyst at Yong’an Futures
Co., said by phone from Hangzhou.  China’s economic expansion may slow to 7.4 percent this
quarter, said Song Guoqing, an academic member of the People’s
Bank of China monetary policy committee.  Greece ’s creditors will
arrive in Athens tomorrow amid doubts the country will meet its
commitments and reluctance among euro-area states to issue more
funds should it fail.  Refined copper imports by China dropped to a ten-month low
at 250,097 tons in June, while exports fell to 35,477 tons from
102,375 tons a month earlier, data from the General
Administration of Customs showed today. Arrivals of copper
concentrate fell 19 percent from a year ago to 480,680 tons.  September futures on the Comex fell 1.3 percent to $3.404 a
pound. Net-short  positions , or wagers on falling prices, held by
funds were 1,763 futures and options contracts as of July 17,
from 4,813 a week earlier, according to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel and tin declined.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
