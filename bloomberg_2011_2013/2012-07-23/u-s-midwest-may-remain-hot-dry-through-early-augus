Iowa ,  Illinois  and the central U.S.
Midwest may remain hot and dry for at least the next two weeks.  Temperatures may remain 5 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 to
4.4 Celsius) above normal over an area centered mainly on Iowa,
 Missouri  and Illinois until Aug. 6, while rainfall lags behind
normal, said Joel Widenor, co-founder of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  “Highs in the 100s will be common today and Wednesday for
the central and southwestern Midwest, adding to yield losses for
filling corn and pod-setting soy,” Widenor said.  Corn prices have risen more than 55 percent since June 15,
signaling higher food prices and boosting expenses for producers
of livestock feed and ethanol, because of the expanding drought
across the Midwest.  Drought now affects 78 percent of the U.S. corn crop, the
world’s largest, and prompted the Agriculture Department on July
11 to cut this year’s estimated harvest by 12 percent. Both
soybean and corn fields are in their worst shape since 1988.  While the heat remains focused on the Midwest, temperatures
along the East Coast may be seasonal from July 28 to Aug. 1
before warming about 3 to 4 degrees above normal from Aug. 2 to
Aug. 6, according to MDA EarthSat Weather.  The West Coast is expected to remain seasonal through Aug.
6, said Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA.  Those temperatures will keep energy use for cooling at
about normal levels or 10 percent higher from July 24 to July
30, said  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in Belton,
Missouri. The Midwest is likely to use 30 to 60 percent more
energy to cool homes and businesses during the same period.  The normal average temperature in New York for Aug. 1 is
78, according to MDA. It’s 74 in Boston; 80 in Washington; 85 in
Houston; 76 in  Chicago ; 80 in Atlanta; 67 in  Seattle  and 76 in
Burbank,  California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
