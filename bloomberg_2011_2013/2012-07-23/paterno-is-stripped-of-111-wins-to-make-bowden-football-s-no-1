Bobby Bowden became the coach with
the most victories at college football’s highest level when
former  Pennsylvania  State University coach  Joe Paterno  was
stripped of 111 wins.  “There’s no rejoicing in the Bowden household right now,”
Bowden said in an interview with ESPN.  The former Florida State University coach gained the
distinction with 377 wins after college sports’ governing body
penalized  Penn State  and Paterno for their roles in a child sex-
abuse scandal, eliminating 112 Nittany Lion victories from 1998
through 2011.  That means the last victory on Paterno’s record, in 1997,
was directed by the quarterback-turned assistant who was part of
his downfall --  Mike McQueary .  Paterno, who was identified as failing to take action after
learning long-time defensive assistant Jerry Sandusky had been
accused of sexual abuse, lost 111 of those victories. He was
fired Nov. 9, five days after Sandusky’s indictment, and Penn
State won one game under interim replacement  Tom Bradley .  The sanction drops Paterno’s victory total to 298 in 46
seasons and makes Bowden No. 1 in the Football Bowl Subdivision
with 377 victories in 44 seasons. Grambling’s Eddie Robinson is
the Division I leader with 408 wins in 57 seasons, ending in
1997. Grambling’s division is one step below Penn State’s and
Florida State’s.  No Celebration  “That doesn’t mean a doggone thing. The circumstances did
it,” said Bowden, who was playing a round of golf yesterday
when he learned he was No. 1 in wins because of the sanctions
against Penn State. “The main issue is what happened up there
with Sandusky. Until that is solved and that is behind everybody,
I won’t be able to celebrate.”  The reduction of wins and other penalties announced
yesterday by National Collegiate Athletic Association President
 Mark Emmert  came after  Louis Freeh , a one-time director of the
 Federal Bureau  of Investigation, released a 267-page report July
12 saying Paterno, who died in January at 85, former university
President  Graham Spanier , 64, and other Penn State officials
failed in their duties to protect children from abuse by
Sandusky, an assistant coach for 31 years.  Sandusky, 68, was convicted last month on 45 criminal
counts in the abuse of 10 boys over a 15-year period.  Paterno was prevented by the university from telling his
side of the story when the allegations emerged. He died before
an interview with Freeh could be arranged.  Shower Assault  McQueary, then a graduate assistant, told Paterno in 2001
that he had seen Sandusky assaulting a young boy in a shower of
the Penn State football building. Though Paterno informed his
immediate superiors about what McQueary told him, he never
contacted police.  The Freeh report, which was commissioned by Penn State,
said Paterno knew about allegations of child-sex abuse by
Sandusky in 1998 -- leading the NCAA to use that year as the
starting point for nullifying victories.  The previous season, McQueary was quarterback as the
Nittany Lions beat the University of Wisconsin 35-10 at Beaver
Stadium in  State College , Pennsylvania, on Nov. 22. Paterno’s
win record officially stops there following yesterday’s NCAA
action.  Penn State’s program under Paterno included five undefeated
seasons and Associated Press national championships in 1982 and
1986. He set a record for longevity, surpassing Amos Alonzo
Stagg, who spent 41 years at the  University of Chicago .  Paterno’s tenure on the staff spanned 12 U.S. presidents
and more than 690 games, more than half of all those played by
Penn State since its football program started in 1887.  Paterno set a record for major college wins in 2001,
breaking longtime Alabama coach Paul “Bear” Bryant’s record of
323, and held the mark until Bowden passed him in 2003. The two
coaches were neck-and-neck until Bowden retired after the 2009
season with 377 wins over 34 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
