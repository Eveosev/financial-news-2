(Corrects date in third paragraph.)  Representative  Randy Neugebauer  is
seeking more information from the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York  on its communications with banks that are involved in
setting the London interbank offered rate.  Neugebauer asked for all communications from August 2007
until July of this year between employees of the  New York  Fed
and staff at the 16 banks that submit Libor rates, the Texas
Republican said in a letter released today.  “There are still many outstanding questions that merit
further investigation,” he said in the letter addressed to
William C. Dudley, president of the regional Fed bank. On July
13, the New York Fed released documents showing it was aware
that Barclays Plc underreported Libor rates in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
