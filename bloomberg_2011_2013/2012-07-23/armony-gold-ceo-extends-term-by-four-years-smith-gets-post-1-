Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR) , Africa’s
third-largest producer of the metal, announced Chief Executive
Officer Graham Briggs will keep his job for another four years.  Briggs, 59, would have retired within the next year under
the company’s normal policy, Johannesburg-based Harmony said in
a statement today. It also named Tom Smith as chief operating
officer for  South Africa . He was COO of the south region.  Briggs, CEO since 2008, continued predecessor Bernard Swanepoel’s efforts to close less-profitable shafts in South
Africa and expand abroad. Harmony has gained 7 percent since the
start of 2008 in Johannesburg, compared with a 1.9 percent drop
in the five-member FTSE/JSE Africa Gold Mining Index.  The CEO “is doing outstanding work in  Papua New Guinea ,”
Chairman Patrice Motsepe said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
