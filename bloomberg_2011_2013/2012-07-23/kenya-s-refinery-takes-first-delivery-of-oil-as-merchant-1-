Kenya  Petroleum Refineries Ltd., the
East African nation’s only oil processor, said it took the first
delivery of crude since it began sourcing fuel to process and
sell refined products to retailers.  A shipment of 82,000 metric tons of Murban crude was
delivered to  Mombasa  port on July 21 after being purchased by
Galan Oil, a trading company, for $65 million, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The company, based in Mombasa, used to take crude from fuel
retailers and refine it for a fee, under what is known as a
tolling arrangement. Kenya last year announced plans to drop
that model and become a so-called merchant refiner, after KPRL
customers complained of losses and inefficient processing.  KPRL, as the company is known, will now compete with Kenyan
companies including  KenolKobil Ltd., (KNOC)  the East African nation’s
biggest fuel retailer by market value, in importation of crude
for processing. Last month KenolKobil was awarded a tender to
deliver 30,704 tons of automotive gasoil in July and 50,000 tons
of premium motor gasoline in August.  KPRL is jointly owned by  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  and the Kenyan
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
