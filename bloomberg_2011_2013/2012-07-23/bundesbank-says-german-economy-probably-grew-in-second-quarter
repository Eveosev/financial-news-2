The  Bundesbank  said the German
economy,  Europe ’s largest, probably expanded moderately in the
second quarter as construction and services growth offset weaker
industrial production.  “According to available indicators, the German economy
should have grown at a moderate pace in the spring,” the
Frankfurt-based Bundesbank said in its monthly report today.
“The outlook for further economic developments is subject to
high uncertainty.”  Germany ’s economy  expanded  0.5 percent in the first quarter
after contracting 0.2 percent in the final three months of 2011.
Since then, unemployment has risen and confidence among
investors and executives has dropped amid slower global growth
and an intensification of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro
region, Germany’s largest export market.  While industrial production probably declined in the second
quarter from the first, construction activity and services
output expanded, according to the report. Furthermore, “German
exporters were able to increase deliveries abroad despite
continued economic difficulties in the euro area and the global
braking,” the Bundesbank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
