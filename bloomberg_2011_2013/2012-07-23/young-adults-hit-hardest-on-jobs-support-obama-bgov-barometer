President  Barack Obama  is drawing
his strongest support from an age group that’s been the hardest
hit on the employment front: young adults.  The BGOV Barometer shows the jobless rate for Americans in
their early 20s is 13.7 percent, compared with 6.3 percent for
voters in their 40s and 50s, according to Labor Department
figures. The president retains the support of 61 percent of
voters aged 18 to 29, compared with about half of voters 30 and
older, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted June
28-July 9.  “This tough economy that they’re facing hasn’t forced them
to shift their allegiance,” Carroll Doherty, associate director
at the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, said in a
July 12 telephone interview. “They’ve been consistently, among
groups, Obama’s strongest supporters. They were in 2008 and they
remain so today.”  Compared with other age brackets, young voters have seen
their employment prospects and income disproportionately hurt
during and since the 18-month recession that ended in June 2009.  For Americans aged 20 to 24, unemployment increased to 13.7
percent in June from 10.8 percent in October 2008. Voters in the
35-to-44 age group saw a smaller rise, to 7 percent from 5.4
percent, and joblessness for those 45 to 54 rose to 6.3 percent
from 4.6 percent during the same period.  Job Approval  “There’s not been any structural change in young peoples’
job approval for Obama since he took office,”  Frank Newport ,
editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll, said in a July 13 telephone
interview. He said that while “it would be highly unusual if
young people” were to throw their support behind Republican
presidential challenger  Mitt Romney , a former governor of
 Massachusetts , “young people are not as certain to vote as
older people.”  Exit polling data from 2008 found that 66 percent of adults
under the age of 30 voted for Obama, compared with 50 percent
for all other voters. With the recent Pew poll putting their
support at 61 percent, some of that youthful enthusiasm may
wane.  “These voters are clearly not as excited as they were in
2008,” Doherty said. “It might show up in turnout in
November.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
