Gasoline imports to the U.S. East
Coast may be curtailed as employment conditions deteriorate and
the region’s refineries accelerate output of the fuel, according
to Poten & Partners Inc., a New York-based consulting firm.  Stockpiles in Padd 1, an area spanning the East Coast, slid
to 52.2 million barrels July 13, the lowest for that time of
year in at least a decade, Energy Department data show. That
spurred speculation refiners would seek to replenish inventories
with imports, Poten said in a report e-mailed July 20.  Such an increase in buying from overseas may be curbed
because of a worsening jobs market in the U.S. north east, Poten
said, citing data from the  Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .
Eighteen percent of firms reported decreases in employment
compared with 10 percent reporting increases, the bank said in
its July Business Outlook Report.  Delta Air Lines Inc.’s September resumption of its 185,000
barrels-a-day Trainer,  Pennsylvania , oil refinery will also help
limit overseas purchases, Poten said. Imports will be curtailed
because gasoline demand peaks in July, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
