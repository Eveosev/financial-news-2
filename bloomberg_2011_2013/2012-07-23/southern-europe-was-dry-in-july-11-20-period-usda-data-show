Southern  Europe  was dry in the 10
days through July 20, with Spain, southern  France , most of Italy
and parts of Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria receiving less than 1
millimeter (0.04 inch) of rain, U.S. Department of Agriculture
satellite data  showed .  Maximum daily temperatures exceeded 30 degrees Celsius (86
Fahrenheit) across the region in the 10-day period and were 5
degrees Celsius or more higher than normal in most of Romania
and Serbia as well as parts of Italy and Bulgaria.  Soil moisture across most of southern Europe is below 30
percent, with values below 10 percent in most of Spain and
Hungary as well as central and southern Italy, according to the
USDA data.  Rainfall in southern  England , the Netherlands, northern
 Germany  and Poland and parts of northern France was more than
double the usual amount, the data showed. The U.K., Germany,
northern France and western Poland were cooler than usual.  The rain in Germany alleviated part of the moisture deficit
in the country’s northern wheat-growing areas since March 1,
according to the data.  Cumulative rainfall in France’s biggest wheat-growing
regions of Centre and Picardie is above the long-term average,
according to the USDA data. Across south and central England,
rainfall has been more than usual, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
