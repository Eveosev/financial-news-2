U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums were
little changed after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  halted operations at
its Meraux refinery in  Louisiana  following a fire in a crude
unit yesterday.  All units at the plant are currently shut and an assessment
is under way to determine if downstream units can be restarted
while the crude unit is being repaired,  Bill Day , a San Antonio-
based spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased 5 cents to $15.45 a barrel
over West Texas Intermediate at 1:58 p.m. in  New York , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium
to the U.S. benchmark added 5 cents to $16.05.  Poseidon’s premium gained 10 cents to $9.30 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon rose 35 cents to $8.35 over WTI. Mars
Blend was steady at $10 a barrel over the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower
sulfur content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon,
decreased 55 cents to $11.95.  Syncrude’s premium was steady at $3 over WTI. Syncrude is a
synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in  Alberta  into
refinery-ready crude.  Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $14 below
WTI.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $1.25 below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
