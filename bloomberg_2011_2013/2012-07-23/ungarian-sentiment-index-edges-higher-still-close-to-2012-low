Hungary’s  economic sentiment  index
edged higher in July amid a “slight” improvement in business
and consumer sentiment.  The index was minus 23.2 compared with minus 24.5 in June,
the GKI research institute in Budapest said in an e-mailed
statement today. The  business-confidence  index increased to
minus 13.3 from minus 14.6, while the gauge of  consumer
confidence  rose to minus 51.4 from minus 52.6.  The improvement in business confidence is “modest” and
follows three months of deterioration, GKI said. Even so,
changes in the gauge “were all within the margin of error.”  Hungary’s  economy  contracted 0.7 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, raising the risk of a recession.
The government, which has said that gross domestic product may
shrink in 2012, is in talks with the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund  on financial assistance.  The forint weakened for a second day and traded at 287.77
per euro yesterday, heading for its weakest close in a week. The
benchmark  BUX (BUX)  stock index has declined 2 percent this month.  Households’ perception of their financial situation over
the next year improved and consumers’ assessment of their
current financial situation is less pessimistic than in May,
when the gauge plunged to a record low level, GKI said.  GKI’s indexes are calculated based on a balance of positive
and negative answers to questions about the outlook for the
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
