Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said regulators should consider withholding exemptions to
the Volcker rule’s prohibition against proprietary trading when
they are sought by federally insured banks.  “Certain capital market activities for federally insured
banks should not be supported by vast amounts of public and
private expenditure,” Raskin said today in the text of remarks
for a speech in Boulder,  Colorado .  The Volcker rule, part of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of
financial regulation, limits proprietary trading while allowing
exemptions for hedging and market-making. The benefits to the
exemptions may be limited because community banks that engage in
traditional banking are the firms providing “true liquidity,”
Raskin said.  “Liquidity is not an inherent public benefit that
justifies the expenditure of significant compliance, oversight,
examination and enforcement costs,” Raskin said at the Graduate
School of Banking at Colorado. She warned of “flawed business
models that create misaligned incentives that lead to what I
believe are low-road outcomes.”  Raskin, who was formerly Maryland’s chief banking
regulator, didn’t comment on the outlook for the  U.S. economy  or
monetary policy. She was appointed to the Fed in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
