The cost to guard against losses on
the debt of  Canada ’s  Nexen Inc. (NXY)  fell to the lowest in almost a
year and its bonds surged after  Cnooc Ltd. (CEO)  agreed to buy the oil
producer for $15.1 billion in the biggest overseas purchase by a
Chinese firm.  Credit-default swaps tied to Nexen declined 86.7 basis
points to a mid-price of 140.3 basis points, down from 227 basis
points on July 20, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market. That’s about the lowest
since the contracts closed at 139 basis points on Aug. 4,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cnooc, rated  six levels above  the Calgary-based company at
Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, would gain assets in Canada,
the U.K., West Africa and the  Gulf of Mexico  that may boost the
Chinese company’s output by 20 percent. Nexen, which has about
$3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, had a ratio of total debt to
earnings of 1.11 last year, more than three times  Cnooc (883) ’s
leverage, Bloomberg data show.  Nexen’s $1.25 billion of 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2037
climbed 14.8 cents from last week to a record 126.9 cents on the
dollar at 9:12 a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The yield fell to 4.57 percent, or 209.8 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, compared with a 296
basis-point spread on July 20.  The deal is “obviously very positive” for Nexen
bondholders, Philip Adams of Chicago-based bond researcher Gimme
Credit LLC wrote today in a research note.  ‘Positive’ Transaction  The level of Nexen’s credit-default swaps, which typically
fall as investor confidence improves and rise as it
deteriorates, means investors would pay $140,300 a year to
protect $10 million of the company’s debt.  The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Cnooc,  China ’s largest offshore oil and gas explorer, will
pay $27.50 for each common share of Calgary-based Nexen,
according to the Beijing-based company’s statement to the Hong
Kong stock exchange today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
