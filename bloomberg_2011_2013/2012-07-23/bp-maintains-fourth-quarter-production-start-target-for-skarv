BP Plc (BP/)  maintained plans to start
output from the Skarv field in the Norwegian Sea in the fourth
quarter after preparations were delayed by a 16-day strike by
oil workers.  “We haven’t changed our estimate for when we plan to start
production,” Jan Erik Geirmo, a spokesman for the company, said
today by phone from Stavanger, on  Norway ’s west coast. “I can’t
say if it will be the beginning, middle or end of the fourth
quarter.”  Norway’s government ended the oil workers’ strike July 10
by ordering a compulsory arbitration. The labor action affected
15 percent of the country’s oil production and 7 percent of gas
output, the Oil Industry Association said June 27.  BP operates the Skarv field with a 23.8 percent stake,
while  Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s biggest producer, controls 36.2
percent. Estimated recoverable reserves are 409 million barrels
of oil equivalent, of which three quarters are gas, according to
BP’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
