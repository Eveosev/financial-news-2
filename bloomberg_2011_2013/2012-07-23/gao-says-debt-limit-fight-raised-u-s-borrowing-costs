Last year’s debt-limit fight cost
taxpayers at least $1.3 billion, according to a report released
today.  The Government Accountability Office said the protracted
budget fight fueled uncertainty among investors, which increased
the government’s borrowing costs last year by $1.3 billion.  The total cost may be even higher, according to the report,
because that figure doesn’t include higher future borrowing
costs or the costs of pulling Treasury officials away from their
usual duties to manage the debt as lawmakers battled over the
conditions of an increase.  “Congress should consider ways to better link decisions
about the debt limit with decisions about spending and revenue
to avoid potential disruptions to the Treasury market and to
help inform the fiscal policy debate in a timely way,” the
report said.  Lawmakers ultimately agreed to cut $2.1 trillion in
 government spending  before voting last August to  raise the debt
limit  to the current $16.4 trillion. The government will
probably be brushing up against the debt ceiling once again by
the end of this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
