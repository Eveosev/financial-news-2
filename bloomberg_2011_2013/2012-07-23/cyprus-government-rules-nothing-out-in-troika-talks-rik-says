The Cypriot government is ruling
nothing out in talks that begin today with the so-called troika,
Nicosia-based state broadcaster  RIK  reported, citing an
interview with Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly.  Initial talks with representatives of the  International
Monetary Fund , the European Union and the  European Central Bank 
will be a consultation, not a negotiation, as the troika wants
to identify areas that need discussion, the broadcaster said.  Talks will focus on the financial industry and the amount
needed for the recapitalization of lenders, and on macroeconomic
issues, RIK said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
