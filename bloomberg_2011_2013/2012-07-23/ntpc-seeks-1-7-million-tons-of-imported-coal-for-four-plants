NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) ,  India ’s largest
electricity generator, is seeking to import 1.7 million metric
tons of steam coal for four units, according to tender notices.  The company plans to buy 1.1 million tons of coal for the
Talcher Thermal and Talcher Kaniha plants in the eastern state
of Odisha and 600,000 tons for the Korba and Sipat units in
Chhattisgarh.  NTPC is seeking coal of gross calorific value of 5,300
kilocalories a kilogram, sulfur and ash content of 0.8 percent
and 10 percent, respectively, and total moisture of 16 percent.  The tender documents will be sold till Aug. 2 and the last
date for receiving bids is Aug. 10, according to the notices on
the company’s website. NTPC’s Talcher plants have a combined
generation capacity of 3,460 megawatts, while the Korba and
Sipat plants generate 2,600 megawatts and 2,980 megawatts,
respectively.  The state-owned company cut its capacity addition target
for the five years ending March 2017 by 42 percent to 14,500
megawatts because of coal shortages, Chairman Arup Roy Choudhury
said on June 13. NTPC last month scrapped a tender for the
import of 5 million tons coal in favor of issuing multiple bids
for smaller quantities, the Economic Times reported on June 21.  NTPC  has an installed generation capacity of 39,174
megawatts, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
