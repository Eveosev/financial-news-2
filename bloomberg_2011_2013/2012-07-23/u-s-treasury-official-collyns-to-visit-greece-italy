A U.S.  Treasury Department 
specialist in international finance will visit Athens and Rome
this week as Europe plunges into fresh market turmoil.  Charles Collyns , the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
international finance, will visit the Greece and Italy from
tomorrow until July 26 to meet with government officials and
private-sector executives, the department said in a statement
today. The Treasury didn’t name the officials.  Stocks and the euro fell today as Catalonia joined a list
of Spanish regions that may tap aid from the central government,
spurring 10-year yields to rise to a euro-era record. Meantime,
Greece’s so-called troika of international creditors -- the
European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  -- arrives tomorrow in Athens,
rekindling concern the currency union will splinter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
