South  Korea ’s national auditor asked
the country’s financial regulator to strengthen supervision of
banks after finding that they didn’t pass on central bank
interest-rate cuts sufficiently to borrowers.  Lenders “unreasonably” charged extra yields, undermining
the Bank of Korea’s policy rate cuts since 2008 and burdening
companies and households, the  Board of Audit and Inspection  of
Korea said today in a statement on its website. The auditor said
it advised the Financial Supervisory Service governor to come up
with measures to correct the practice.  The auditor’s findings may fuel criticism of banks after
the country’s antitrust agency last week said it is probing nine
lenders and 10 brokers over possible fixing of a key lending
rate.  South Korea ’s Financial Services Commission and related
agencies met last week to discuss developing a short-term rate
that can replace the certificate of deposit rate and find ways
to enhance transparency in its calculation.  The 91-day  certificate of deposit  rate is a benchmark for
banks’ variable rate for lending and borrowing as well as for
interest swaps or floating yields for bonds. Quotes are
collected twice a day by the Korea Financial Investment
Association, or KOFIA, from 10 brokerages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
