Russia won’t reduce the euro’s share
in its reserves from about 40 percent, President  Vladimir Putin 
said after talks with Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti .  “We aren’t changing anything -- we believe in the
fundamental abilities of the European economy,” Putin told
reporters today at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.  The euro slipped below its lifetime average against the
 U.S. dollar  and to the lowest level in more than 11 years
against the yen today on concern the debt crisis is deepening in
the European Union, Russia’s biggest trading partner. With
$505.3 billion in reserves, the world’s fourth largest, Russia
has sought to diversify its holdings by boosting gold purchases
and adding the Canadian and Australian dollars to the stockpile.  Russia cut the euro’s share in its international reserves
to 42.1 percent as of Jan. 1, 2012, down from 43.1 percent a
year earlier, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
