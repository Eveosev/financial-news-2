Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, dropped the most in more than two months as prices
for the steelmaking raw material fell to the lowest since
November. MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA, the mining company of
Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , also slumped.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  lost  2.6 percent to 36.88
reais in  Sao Paulo  today, the biggest drop since May 17. MMX
 declined  3.5 percent to 5.31 reais, the lowest close in a week.
Brazil’s Bovespa benchmark  index  dropped 2.1 percent.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery  fell  1.1 percent to $123.60
a ton today, its ninth consecutive decline to the lowest since
Nov. 4, according to data compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.
Prices for the mineral used to produce steel are being hurt by
the economic slowdown in China, the biggest iron-ore consumer,
said Leonardo Brito, an equity analyst at hedge fund Teorica
Investimentos.  “These iron-ore prices are worrying,” he said in a
telephone interview from  Rio de Janeiro  today. “Vale is
suffering from that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
