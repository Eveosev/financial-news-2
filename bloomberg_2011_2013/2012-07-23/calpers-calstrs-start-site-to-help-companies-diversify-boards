The two biggest U.S. pension funds
have commissioned a website designed to help companies find
corporate directors from different backgrounds and industries.  The Diverse Director DataSource, or 3D, was introduced last
week by the  California Public Employees’ Retirement System  and
California State Teachers’ Retirement System at a press
conference in  New York . The pensions hired GMI Ratings to build
and maintain the online database, which currently lists 400
potential board candidates, said GMI, a provider of research on
corporate governance.  “Board diversity is a top priority to us,” said Carol Moody, senior  fund manager  for investment compliance and
operational risk for Calpers on July 19. The fund has about $233
billion in assets.“It’s key to our fiduciary responsibility.
And if it’s important to us, we can really drive the needle.”  More than half of U.S. corporations say a lack of qualified
candidates is part of the challenge they face in diversifying
their boards, according to a survey released last week by
Corporate Board Member magazine and search firm  Spencer Stuart .
Potential board candidates can submit their information for
free, while recruiters access the database via subscription.  The website address is  http://www.gmi3d.com .  To contact the reporter on this story:
