Uruguay’s central bank increased
 reserve requirements  to damp a pick-up in lending and ease
pressure on consumer prices.  The move will help “moderate inflationary pressures and
the eventual negative impact on competitiveness,” the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  The amount banks have to put aside as reserves will rise to
20 percent of the increase in deposits in the national currency
since April 2011, from the current 15 percent, the bank said. In
relation to the increase in foreign currency deposits over the
same period, the reserve ratio rose to 40 percent from 27
percent.  Uruguayan inflation was 8 percent in June, little changed
on the previous two months and up from 7.5 percent in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
