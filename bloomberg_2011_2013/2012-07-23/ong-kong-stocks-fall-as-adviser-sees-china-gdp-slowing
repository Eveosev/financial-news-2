Hong Kong   stocks  fell, with the Hang
Seng Index headed for its biggest drop in two months, after a
Chinese central bank adviser predicted the nation’s economic
growth could slow further and as the prospect of Greece leaving
the euro zone resurfaced.  The Hang Seng Index fell 2.4 percent to 19,161.92 as of
09:34 a.m. local time, all but erasing last week’s gains. All
shares on the 49-member gauge retreated.  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies dropped 2.8 percent to
9,299.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
