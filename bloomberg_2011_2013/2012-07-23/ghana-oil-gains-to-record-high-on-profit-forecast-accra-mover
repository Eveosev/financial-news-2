Ghana Oil Company Ltd. (GOIL) , which
operates the second-biggest network of gasoline stations in the
West African nation, rose to the highest on record as investors
bet first-half profit increased.  The stock increased 2 percent to 51 pesewas by the close in
Accra, the capital, the highest since November 2007 when it
listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange.  “There is big investor anticipation for the company’s
first-half results,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at  Ecobank (ETI) 
Development Corp., said by phone. “Our forecast is a 40 percent
increase in net income year-on-year and between 25 and 30
percent growth in revenue.”  Confidence in the company, known as Goil, has been renewed
since a branding program this year, Mensah said. Goil changed
its logo and has been rehabilitating fuel stations. The branding
will help boost market share to 35 percent in two years from 23
percent, board member Kojo Bonsu said on May 18.  Goil’s first-half results are expected at any time, Mensah
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
