Copper traders probably reduced bets
that prices will drop as the number of outstanding futures
contracts fell to a two-year low as prices rose.  Open interest  in London Metal Exchange copper futures
dropped by 14,362 contracts to 412,893 lots in the week ended
July 19, according to exchange data on Bloomberg. The number
fell to 409,828 on July 18, the lowest since February 2010,
exchange data show. Copper for delivery in three months rose 2.3
percent over the period.  A combination of decreasing open interest and higher prices
suggests traders are covering their bets on lower prices,
according to Macquarie Group Ltd.  Open interest in the five other industrial metals traded on
the LME also declined in the week as prices rose.  Following are changes to market open interest for LME
members and clients compiled by the exchange for the six biggest
industrial metals futures traded on the bourse in the week ended
July 19, along with price changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
