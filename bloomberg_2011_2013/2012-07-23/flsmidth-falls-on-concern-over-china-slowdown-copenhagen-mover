FLSmidth & Co. A/S (FLS) , a Danish maker
of mining equipment and cement production plants, fell the most
in eight weeks in Copenhagen on the outlook for slowing demand
for its products as  China ’s expansion cools.  The shares slid as much as 4 percent, the biggest decline
since June 1. They dropped 3.3 percent, making it the fourth-
 biggest loser  in the Copenhagen 20 Index, to 332.3 kroner as of
2:09 p.m. in the Danish capital.  Growth in the world’s second-largest economy may slow for a
seventh straight quarter to 7.4 percent in the three months to
September, said Song Guoqing, a member of the People’s Bank of
China monetary policy committee. FLSmidth got 30 percent of its
sales from Asia last year, its biggest geographical market,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Investors are fearing lower Chinese growth, as well as a
slowdown elsewhere in Asia, will cool demand for metals and
minerals, thus cooling demand for mining equipment,” said  Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa, Denmark, with
an “overweight” rating. “Slower growth will also hurt demand
for cement.”  European stocks  also slid the most in two days since April
as Der Spiegel magazine reported the  International Monetary Fund 
may stop paying further rescue aid to Greece, citing
unidentified European Union officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
