The leu weakened for a fourth day to
an all-time low against the euro as the cost of insuring
Romanian bonds against non-payment with credit-default swaps
jumped to the highest in six weeks.  The Romanian currency depreciated 0.8 percent to 4.6348 per
euro by 5:37 p.m. in Bucharest, the weakest since Bloomberg
began to track the data in 1999. Worsening perceptions of
creditworthiness lifted the countryâ€™s default swaps by 28 basis
pints to 453, the highest since June 11, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
