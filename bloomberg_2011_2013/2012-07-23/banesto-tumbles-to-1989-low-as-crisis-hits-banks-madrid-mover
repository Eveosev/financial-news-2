Spanish bank stocks fell, with  Banco
Santander SA (SAN)   unit   Banco Espanol de Credito SA (BTO)  reaching its
lowest intraday level since at least 1989, as concern about the
government’s ability to rein in its deficit drove up financing
costs.  Banesto fell  as much as  10 percent, its biggest intraday
decline since 2002, before paring losses to close at 2.10 euros,
a 0.8 percent drop.  Banco Popular Espanol SA (POP)  slumped as much as
8.5 percent to a 21-year  low  before closing down 3.2 percent at
1.32 euros.  Surging sovereign debt costs for Spain are lowering the
value of banks’ bond holdings and raising the prospect that
their businesses will be damaged if the government is forced to
take more austerity measures. The ratio of bad loans to total
lending was close to a record high at 8.95 percent in May as
loans and deposits at banks also shrank.  “News from  Spain  keeps getting worse and that affects the
banks directly,” said Peter Braendle, who helps manage about
$55 billion at Zurich-based Swisscanto Asset Management. “It
affects them on the debt side but also because of the impact on
their banking business if Spain has to do more on the deficit.”  Spanish banks pared losses after the stock market regulator
imposed a short-sale ban today on all shares. Santander, which
fell as much as 5.1 percent earlier in the session, closed up 1
percent at 4.23 euros.  The yield on Spanish five-year debt surged to 7.32 percent
from 6.80 percent on July 20. The extra yield investors demand
to hold Spanish 10-year securities instead of bunds widened to
630.18 basis points from 609.96 on July 20. A basis point is a
hundredth of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
