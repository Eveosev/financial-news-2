The lira weakened the most in more
than three weeks on concern the  European debt crisis  is
deepening, hurting demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The Turkish currency depreciated for a third day, losing
0.7 percent to 1.8209 per dollar at 6:15 p.m. in Istanbul, the
biggest drop since June 28. Yields on two-year benchmark bond
rose nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 7.86
percent, increasing the most since June 25.  The IMF will stop paying rescue aid to  Greece  as it is
already clear the nation will not be able to fulfill its promise
to cut debt to 120 percent of annual economic growth in euro
terms by 2020, Der Spiegel magazine reported, citing
unidentified EU officials. German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s “very skeptical” that European leaders will
be able to rescue Greece. Turkey sends around 40 percent of its
exports to  Europe .  “The outlook for the  euro zone  is worsening,” Fatih Keresteci, a strategist at HSBC Bank AS in Istanbul, said in an
e-mailed note. “Reports that the IMF may stop credit flow to
Greece are deepening this panic sentiment.”  The central bank lent today 1 billion liras ($1.64 billion)
at the lowest 5.75 percent policy rate in its daily repurchase
agreements auction. It provided 3 billion liras the same day
last week. The bank has lent at the lowest rate every day since
June 5, the longest streak since March 21.  Governor Erdem Basci introduced an interest-rate corridor
in October to execute the bank’s unorthodox monetary policy,
switching between rates of 5.75 percent and 11.5 percent on a
daily basis to tame inflation and rein in the current-account
deficit by curbing credit growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
