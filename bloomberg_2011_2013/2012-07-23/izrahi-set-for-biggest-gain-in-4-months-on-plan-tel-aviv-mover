Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  headed for
the largest gain in almost four months after the country’s
fourth-largest bank approved a business plan that boosts return
on equity to 17 percent.  The shares added 3.1 percent, poised for the biggest gain
since Mar. 25, to 28.88 shekels as of 1:22 p.m. in Tel Aviv. The
 Tel Aviv Banking Index (TABANK)  fell 0.7 percent to 806.22 and the TA-25
fell 1.1 percent.  “While the aims are very ambitious, they met the aims of
their previous strategic plan and they deserve credit for
that,” Adi Scop, a banking analyst and the head of sales at
I.B.I.- Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. said today by phone.
“If they meet the new targets, I tip my hat to them.”  Mizrahi’s board approved a five-year plan that envisages
meeting core  capital requirements  by January 2014 and
maintaining the existing dividend policy. The bank said the ROE
target is based on the current core capital requirement of 7.5
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
