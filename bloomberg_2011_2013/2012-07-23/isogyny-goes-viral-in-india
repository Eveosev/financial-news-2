In an especially shocking example of the gender violence ubiquitous in  India , a teenaged girl leaving a pub with a friend on the night of July 10 in  Guwahati , the largest city in the north-eastern state of Assam, got into an argument with a group of men and  was assaulted  by the mob for almost half an hour, while bystanders watched. Already a victim, locally, of the peculiar cocktail of misogyny and moralism that lurks in almost all public spaces in India, the girl then also had her humiliation broadcast to the entire country by  a local news channel  whose reporter happened to be on the scene, and whose  voice seems to be heard  on the footage, possibly egging the mob on. Even worse, every subsequent reaction from the individuals and groups implicated at different levels in the case -- the news channel, the police and the state, even the National Women's Commission -- seemed to serve not as a condemnation of gender violence so much as further confirmation of the multiple layers of misogyny in India. The news channel's head,  Atanu Bhuyan , argued that condemning his outfit for broadcasting footage of the attack was tantamount to "shooting the messenger," and that the police had made several arrests based on the footage. Less helpful to the case for his defense, though, were his  Twitter posts  that "I've been heading News Live for 5 years now. And I've seen that most incidents of molestation takes place in front of bars"  and  "Prostitutes form a major chunk of girls who visit bars and night clubs." This sly and utterly irrelevant bit of innuendo is nevertheless valuable in what it reveals about the assumptions of Indian patriarchy, and about the work that lays ahead for Indian feminism in changing not just laws but worldviews. Bhuyan decided  to resign  in the wake of the controversy. Meanwhile, Tarun Gogoi, the chief minister of Assam, met the victim, presumably to offer his government's commitment to seeking out and prosecuting her attackers. His office then  sent out a statement  that revealed the victim's name along with her photograph. India's  National Commission for Women , a government body with many idealistic goals, but hamstrung in practice by the fact that many of its office-bearers owe their positions to their proximity to the ruling Congress Party, sent a representative, Alka Lamba, to Guwahati to compile a report on the incident. Lamba's main intervention in the case was to  inadvertently name the victim  at a news conference. Back in the capital,  New Delhi , the commission's head, Mamta Sharma, condemned the incident, but also took the opportunity to  suggest  that women should be careful about how they dress and to proclaim that she didn't support the practice of "aping the West" (not coincidentally, also a favorite theme of India's moral police). The victim would be fully entitled to ask: With friends like this, who needs enemies? Two main questions emerged from the case. The first, and to my mind most important, was whether the condemnations of the incident that emerged from various sources of authority did not feed rather than reject the climate of ideas from which such violence emerges. The best formulation of this came from the writer  Mitali Saran  in the Business Standard, who pointed to the attempts in many other spheres to naturalize gender violence, such as through language: The second question concerned the role of television in sensationalizing the case by gratuitously replaying the footage, and occluding the central fact of gender violence through a mix of concocted outrage, moralism and voyeurism. In much of India's thriving television-news industry, reality is now presented through the conventions of soap opera.  Shoma Chaudhury wrote in the weekly Tehelka : And on the website of the media watchdog The Hoot, the media critic  Sevanti Ninan  noted: One of the most depressing realities of this country is the gulf in freedom on offer to men and women in public (and indeed private) spaces; one gender enjoys an excessive license and the other suffers an unnatural suppression. This unspoken and socially legitimized curtailment of the right of women to dress, move and mix freely, and the projection of various unreasonable meanings onto their decisions to do so, means that all accounts of India's "growth story" are in an important sense misleading, if not downright untrue. If one were to apply the  human-capability method  used by scholars such as  Amartya Sen  and  Martha Nussbaum  to India, one would find the country's men to beÂ  vastly better off women merely because of their uncomplicated access to various freedoms that for women are available only after the most prolonged negotiations and conflicts. A depressing number of instances that appear almost daily in Indian public life, from  moral policing  by nationalist parties to disagreements with women being expressed in  grossly offensive  and sexualized language, attest to the fact that Indians of a patriarchal persuasion -- including many women -- have found the new freedoms on offer in a modernizing society very hard to digest. A recent poll showed that of all the major economies of the world, India is the  worst for women . In a very real sense, the Indian woman is, almost without exception, a second-class citizen. But the picture isn't one of unrelieved darkness. After all, women in India have historically had it much worse, and our modern history would be nothing without the struggles waged by feminists of various persuasions not just for their own rights but for those of all kinds of marginalized groups. (A thorough overview of women's movements in India from 1800 on is provided by Radha Kumar in her book " The History of Doing .") If anything, one of the paradoxes opened up by India's consumer revolution over the last two decades is that even as it has created many new opportunities and rewards for women in terms of education, employment and material betterment, it has also managed to narrow the terms of  Indian feminism  and to co-opt that movement's language for its own purposes. (Advertisements these days for goods -- from scooters to push-up bras to  skin whiteners  -- offer women the promise of liberation and empowerment for a small fee; that is, as consumers and not as citizens). The value of these goods and freedoms isn't to be denied, but they allow for a society in which a one-dimensional liberation can calmly and complacently co-exist with misogyny. To borrow a phrase from William Blake's great poem " London ," many "mind-forged manacles" and stereotypes in India have yet to be cut to pieces -- in all probability by Indian women themselves -- before the day arrives when gratuitous eruptions of violence such as that seen in Guwahati become a thing of the past.
