Repower Systems SE will supply 66
megawatts of turbines to five U.K. projects developed by
companies including units of  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and  AES Corp. (AES)   Repower, the Hamburg-based unit of  India ’s largest turbine
maker,  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) , will supply machines for GDF Suez’s
International Power Plc unit, which is working in  Scotland  on
projects at Blantyre Muir and Barlockhart Moor, according to an
e-mailed statement. Terms were not disclosed.  Repower will also provide machines at the Yelvertoft wind
project by AES Wind Generation in Northamptonshire along with
the Wathegar facility developed by Whirlwind Renewables Ltd. and
FIM Services Ltd. in Caithness, Scotland. RidgeWind Ltd. will
get turbines for its Wandylaw facility in Northumbria, the
statement said.  Repower surpassed 1 gigawatt of signed wind contracts in
the U.K. with today’s orders. The U.K. is seeking to meet a
target to get 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources by
2020, compared with 3.8 percent now. It plans to reach 13
gigawatts of onshore wind by that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
