Money managers boosted bets on
higher prices of white, or refined, sugar traded in London by 37
percent in the week ended July 17, according to NYSE Liffe, the
derivatives arm of NYSE Euronext.  Net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, rose to
10,070 futures and options, the commitments of traders report
published on the exchange’s website today showed. That compares
with 7,339 contracts a week earlier, according to the data.
White sugar rose 1.6 percent in the period on speculation of
supplies from top grower  Brazil  and  India  will be limited.  Above-average rainfall last month in Brazil, the world’s
largest producer, delayed the crop and shipments. India’s
monsoon, which brings more than 70 percent of the country’s
annual rainfall, was 22 percent lower than a 50-year average
since June 1, the weather bureau said July 15.  In cocoa, money managers trimmed their net-long position to
42,280 futures and options from 42,914 contracts a week earlier,
the data showed. Cocoa fell 5.7 percent in the period.  Money managers increased their net-long position in robusta
coffee to 20,380 contracts, the data show. That compares with
19,979 futures and options a week earlier. The beans rose 3.5
percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers were net-long by 134
contracts compared with 129 futures and options a week earlier,
according to the data. The grain climbed 4.9 percent over the
five sessions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
