Fuel-oil  shipments to  Asia  from
Western countries for August delivery rose from a week earlier
to 3.44 million metric tons, according to vessel-charter data
and information from traders compiled by Bloomberg.  At least 14 tankers, including five very large crude
carriers, are scheduled to arrive in Asia next month after
collecting the fuel for ships and power generators from ports in
 Europe , the U.S. and the Caribbean, data from shipbrokers
including Poten & Partners Inc. show.  The volume compares with 3.3 million tons reported a week
ago and 2.5 million tons for July, a nine-month low. September
shipments remained unchanged at 940,000 tons from a week
earlier.  The following is a summary of tankers reported by ship
brokers and traders as contracted to carry fuel oil to  East
Asia . Cargoes are in thousands of tons. Arrival time is
calculated based on information on the e-ships.net website and
assuming a total of four days for loading and unloading at
ports. A VLCC can carry about 2 million barrels of oil. Charters
are subject to cancellation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
