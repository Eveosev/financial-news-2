Serbia ’s central bank said it sold
euros to boost the dinar after it weakened today.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 10 million
euros ($12.1 million) to “smooth the dinar’s intraday swings,”
the bank said on its website without giving any further details.
It acted on the local  currency market  for the first time since
June 4, when it sold 18.5 million euros to bolster the dinar.  Three currency traders in Belgrade who asked to remain
unidentified, in line with the policies of their banks, said the
bank was selling euros as the dinar approached 118 per euro. The
dinar traded at 117.4597 at 5:18 p.m. in Belgrade, or 0.47
percent weaker compared with the official mid-rate on July 20.  The central bank, which has been under pressure from
expansive fiscal policies and widening budget and current-
account deficits, has sold a total of 1.3 billion euros this
year to support the dinar, the poorest performing currency in
 Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
