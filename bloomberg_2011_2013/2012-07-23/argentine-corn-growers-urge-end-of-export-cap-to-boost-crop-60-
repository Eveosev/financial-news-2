Corn producers in  Argentina  are
urging the government to lift a cap on exports and pledging to
boost output by as much as 60 percent should the government free
them to tap rising foreign demand for the grain.  Growers will produce as much as 31 million metric tons of
corn in the 2012-2013 season if a 15 million-ton cap on exports
is lifted, said the Argentine Association of Regional Consortia
for Agricultural Experimentation. Production in the current
2011-2012 crop year is estimated at 19.3 million tons, the
 Buenos Aires  Cereals Exchange said on July 15.  Farmers in the country, the world’s third-largest corn
exporter, are urging the government to let them take advantage
of the worst drought in half a century in the U.S. to boost
exports as Chinese demand grows. President  Cristina Fernandez de
Kirchner  has limited exports to ensure Argentina’s domestic
consumption, which the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  estimates
at 8.6 million tons in the next season.  “This should be the corn year for Argentina,” the
association, known as Crea, said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Should the government announce the entire lifting of corn
export quotas, farmers would have enough confidence to increase
their planting.”  Argentine this month increased the quota from 10.5 million
tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
