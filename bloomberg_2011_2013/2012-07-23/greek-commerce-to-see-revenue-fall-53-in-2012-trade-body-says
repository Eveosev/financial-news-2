Greek retailers and wholesalers will
see revenue fall by as much as 53 percent in 2012 as the
country’s fifth year of recession will continue to hit sales,
the  National Confederation of Hellenic Commerce  said.  Greece’s unemployment rate soared to a record 22.5 percent
in April amid a slump deepened by austerity measures linked to
two bailouts the country has received. Retail sales fell 11.6
percent in the same month. Greece’s coalition government is
still working on another package of measures worth 11.5 billion
euros ($13.9 billion) before officials representing the so-
called troika of creditors arrive in Athens tomorrow.  The average level of revenue in 2012 for 3,000 retail and
wholesale companies surveyed by the confederation will be
144,508 euros, down from 309,888 euros in 2011 and 425,329 euros
in 2009, the Athens-based trade group said in an e-mailed
 statement  today.  The firms from across  Greece  forecast their profit this
year will fall to an average of 22,730 euros, a decline from
25,199 euros in 2011 and 49,213 euros in 2009, according to the
statement.  The companies predicted that the number of workers they
employ will fall to an average of 2.58 people in 2012, compared
with 3.01 in 2011 and 3.67 in 2009, the survey found.  Given such operating conditions, and at a time when retail
and wholesale companies are unable to secure new financing from
banks, Greece must introduce a law to protect heavily indebted
companies, the confederation said.  Of the companies polled, only 27 percent had managed to get
bank loans with the average amount at 145,495 euros, the survey
poll. The margin of error was plus or minus 2.05 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
