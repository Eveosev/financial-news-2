AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  climbed the
most in more than seven weeks in Johannesburg trading after the
third-largest gold producer said output was higher than expected
and it arranged a $1 billion credit facility.  Second-quarter production rose 9 percent to 1.073 million
ounces from the previous three months and compared with its
target of 1.04 million ounces, the Johannesburg-based company
said in a statement today. Earnings excluding one-time items may
drop to $240 million to $255 million in the quarter through June
from $429 million in the quarter through March, it said.  Gold producers in  South Africa  are trying to expand output
to mitigate profit erosion caused by above-inflation increases
in some costs including electricity and labor. AngloGold mines
about a third of its metal in the country.  The stock advanced 3.2 percent, the most since May 31, to
265.50 rand by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The five-year revolving facility replaces a four-year
option maturing April 2014, improving the companyâ€™s  debt
profile , AngloGold said in a separate statement. Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ and Barclays Plc were the coordinators, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
