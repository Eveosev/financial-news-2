Canadian natural gas advanced on
forecasts of hotter-than-normal weather that may spark greater
power-plant use of the fuel.  August gas in Alberta  climbed 1.2 percent as MDA EarthSat
Weather in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , predicted above-normal
temperatures across most of the lower 48 states through Aug. 6.
Cooling demand in the U.S. may be 6 percent above normal from
July 29 through Aug. 2, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri.  Alberta  gas for August delivery gained 2.75 cents to
C$2.3675 gigajoule ($2.20 per million British thermal units) as
of 5 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market. Gas
traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 3.6 cents to settle at $3.117 per million Btu, the
highest close since Dec. 22.  The high temperature in Chicago on July 30 may be 87
degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 3 above normal, according
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania. New York’s high
may be 8 above normal at 92 degrees on Aug. 2.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.3 billion cubic
feet at 5 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.93 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.73 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 639 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.979 billion cubic feet today, or 76 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
