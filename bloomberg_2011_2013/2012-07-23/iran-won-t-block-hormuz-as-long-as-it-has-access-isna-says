Iran won’t block the  Strait of
Hormuz  as long as it has access to the waterway, the state-run
Iranian Students News Agency reported, citing Ali-reza Tangsiri,
deputy naval chief of the Revolutionary Guard Corps.  “Common sense does not recommend that Iran close the
Strait of Hormuz as long as it is using it,” Tangsiri was cited
as saying today in the port city of  Bandar Abbas . “As long as
Iran can use the Strait of Hormuz, others are free to pass
through it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
