The benchmark gauge for U.S. options
prices rose the most in eight months as concern that the
 European debt crisis  is worsening spurred losses in equities.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, surged 17 percent to 19.01 at 12:32 p.m. in  New York ,
poised for its biggest gain since Nov. 9. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index, a benchmark measure for U.S. equities, slid 1.4
percent to 1,343.15. In Europe, the  VStoxx Index (V2X) , a measure of
Euro Stoxx 50 Index option prices, rose 16 percent to 28.08 and
posted the biggest two-day gain in almost nine months, as the
equity gauge tumbled 2.6 percent.  “Investors are coming to the realization that things are
slowing down here, and it’s not getting better abroad,” Terry L. Morris, who helps oversee manages about $2.4 billion at
Wyomissing, Pennsylvania-based National Penn Investors Trust
Co., said in a telephone interview. “Complacency has gotten
pretty high. The combination of Greece and  Spain , and the China
slowdown put investors in a more bearish mode.”  Equities joined a global slump today before the arrival in
Athens tomorrow of Greece’s troika of international creditors --
the European Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund . In Spain, Catalonia joined a list
of regions that may tap aid from the central government. Spain’s
10-year yields surged above 7.5 percent for the first time.  China Slowdown  Song Guoqing, an academic member of the People’s Bank of
China monetary policy committee, predicted the nation’s
expansion may cool to 7.4 percent this quarter. He also warned
that a decline in producer prices in tandem with consumer
inflation may hurt investment returns of industrial companies.  The VIX averaged 17.1 this month through July 20, compared
with the mean of 20.1 since its inception in 1990 and 19.1
during the first half of this year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  “Volatility had been so sucked out of the market,” Chip Hendon, who helps manage $14 billion including options at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, said in a phone
interview. “With the setup with the VIX being as low as it’s
been, you could see a volatile market, you could see the VIX
continue to rise.”  In Asia, the HSI Volatility Index, which measures the
expected volatility of the  Hang Seng Index , rose 18 percent, the
most since May, to 22.19. The Nikkei Volatility Index gained 21
percent to 21.37.  To contact the reporters on this story:
