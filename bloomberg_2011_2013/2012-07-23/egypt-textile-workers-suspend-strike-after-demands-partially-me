Workers at  Egypt ’s Misr Spinning and
Co. in Mahalla City suspended a strike they started last week,
after the company’s board met some of their demands.  The workers, who were striking over low wages and
allegations of corruption, were promised the distribution of
profit-sharing payments that have been delayed since 1992, and
an increase in their yearly bonuses and other benefits, Kamal
el-Fayoumi, a labor activist, said today.  “The workers decided to call off the rest of the demands
until after Eid,” the festival that marks the end of the
fasting period of Ramadan in about a month’s time, he said.  Other demands by the workers include the improvement of the
company’s health-care system, restructuring the management and
purging it of corrupt officials. The strike is part of a surge
of labor activism that may complicate newly elected President
Mohamed Mursi’s efforts to revive an economy struggling to
recover after last year’s revolt against  Hosni Mubarak .  Workers in Mahalla, in the Nile Delta north of Cairo, held
strikes in 2006 and 2008 under Mubarak that received widespread
coverage and contributed to the spread of opposition to his
rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
