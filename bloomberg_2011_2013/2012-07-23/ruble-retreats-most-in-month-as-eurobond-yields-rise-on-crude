The ruble depreciated the most in
almost two months against the dollar and yields on  Russia ’s
international debt rose as bets on decelerating global economic
growth hurt prices for oil, the country’s main export.  The ruble lost 2.1 percent to 32.72 per dollar by the 7
p.m. close in Moscow, the sharpest decline since May 31.
Russia’s $3 billion of Eurobonds due April 2042 fell, increasing
the yield by 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 4.754
percent.  Brent crude  sank 3 percent to $103.63 per barrel after a
Chinese central bank adviser said the nation’s economy may cool
further. International creditors meet in Athens tomorrow amid
concern  Greece  may not meet its bailout targets, and after an
aid package for  Spain  failed to prevent the euro declining to
the lowest in more than two years against the dollar.  “We believe that the ruble is vulnerable near-term, as it
has lagged the selloff of other emerging-market currencies,”
 Benoit Anne , the London-based head of emerging-market strategy
at Societe Generale SA, said in an e-mailed note to clients.
“There may be some temporary support locally coming from the
tax payment requirements, but overall we think that a return to
the 37 area against the basket cannot be ruled out.”  Russian companies pay taxes in the second half of every
month. Exporters convert revenue from abroad into rubles,
boosting the Russian currency.  Weakening Bets  “We need to watch the news from  Europe ,” Vladislav Filimonov, a currency trader at UBS AG in Moscow, said by e-
mail. “In the short term the move looks a bit overdone.”  The ruble lost 1.6 percent to 39.61 per euro and 1.9
percent to 35.8205 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable fowards showing the ruble at 33.2445 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 32.5605 per
dollar on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
