Tim Cahill  is poised to join the New
York Red Bulls after Everton agreed on terms with  Major League
Soccer  for the transfer of the Australian midfielder.  The 32-year-old Cahill will move to the Red Bulls for a
“nominal fee” subject to him agreeing on personal terms and
passing a physical exam,  Everton said  in a statement on its
website late yesterday. He’ll travel to the U.S. in the next few
days, the Premier League club added.  Cahill, who’s scored 68 goals in 278 games for Everton
since moving from Millwall in 2004, would join former Premier
League players Thierry Henry and Teemu Tainio in New York.
Cahill moved to  England  in August 1997, joining Millwall from
hometown side Sydney United on a free transfer.  The attacking midfielder has scored 24 times in 55
appearances for  Australia  -- including the country’s first goals
at a World Cup tournament in 2006 -- after waiting a decade for
the chance to represent the country of his birth.  Cahill played for Western Samoa’s under-17 team as a 14-
year-old in 1994, making him ineligible for Australia under
soccer’s rules at the time. Governing body FIFA changed its
eligibility regulations in 2003 and a year later accepted his
application to play for Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
