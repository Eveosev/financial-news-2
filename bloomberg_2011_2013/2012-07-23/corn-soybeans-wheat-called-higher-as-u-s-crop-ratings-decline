What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said the condition of
the domestic crop as of yesterday fell to 26 percent good to
excellent from 31 percent a week earlier, Jon Marcus, the
president of Lakefront Futures and Options, LLC in Chicago, said
by telephone. The rating is the lowest for the week since 1988,
USDA data show.  -- Soybean futures may open up 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel as
the amount of the U.S. crop that earned top ratings fell to 31
percent, also the lowest for the week since 1988, from 34
percent, Marcus said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal futures
may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher as
the spring crop in the U.S. was rated 60 percent good or
excellent, down from 65 percent a week earlier, Marcus said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
