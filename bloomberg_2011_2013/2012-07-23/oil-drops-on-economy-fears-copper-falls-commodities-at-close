time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials slid 2
percent to 1541.466.  CRUDE OIL  Oil dropped to the lowest level in four days in New York,
falling below $89 a barrel amid speculation that global fuel
demand will falter as  China’s economy  slows and Europe struggles
to control its debt crisis.  Crude for September delivery fell as much as $3.43 to
$88.40 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile

contract decreased 1.2 percent to $91.83 on July 20. Prices are
10.4 percent lower this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures were little changed at $3.078 in  New
York  for a second day after forecasts for hotter-than-normal

widest since May 17.  Naphtha swaps for August fell $2, or 0.2 percent, to
$874.50 a ton, PVM data showed.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold declined in London as concern that  Europe ’s debt
crisis is deepening boosted the dollar and curbed demand for the
metal as an alternative investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 1 percent to $1,569.05

Platinum was 1.6 percent lower at $1,391.24 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for a second day in London, extending last
week’s drop, as increasing concern that  Greece  may leave the
 euro zone  bolstered the dollar.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  December-delivery corn advanced 0.5 percent to $8 a bushel

2,000 pounds in Chicago, an all-time high for the most-active

that demand for commodities will decline as Europe struggles to
contain its debt crisis and economic growth slows in  China , the
top cooking-oil user.  October-delivery palm oil lost as much as 2.2 percent to
2,976 ringgit ($938) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
