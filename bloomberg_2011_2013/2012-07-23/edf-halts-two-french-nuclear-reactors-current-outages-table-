Electricite de France SA halted its
1,300-megawatt Cattenom-3 and 1,330-megawatt Flamanville-1
reactors for maintenance on July 21, according to the nation’s
grid operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  EDF started its 915-megawatt Saint Laurent-1 nuclear power
plant on July 21 and its 1,310-megawatt Golfech unit on July 22
after scheduled maintenance, RTE data show.  EDF, the world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator, has
41 reactors online, representing 70 percent of available nuclear
capacity, RTE data show. EDF’s 58 atomic plants generate about
78 percent of the country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out
of  service , their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
