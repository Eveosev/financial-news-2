Indonesia, the second-largest rubber
producer after  Thailand , plans to replant about 9 percent of the
crop-area next year to help boost yields at aging plantations,
an agriculture ministry official said.  Old and low-yielding trees spread across 300,000 hectares
(741,316 acres) would be replaced with new ones, said Rismansyah
Danasaputra, the ministry’s director of perennial crops. Rubber
plantations cover a total of 3.2 million hectares of the
Southeast Asian country, he said.  The plan is “not final yet,” Danasaputra said by phone
from Jakarta today. “It’s based on proposals from local
administrations because many trees in their regions are not
productive anymore.”  Output in Indonesia may drop 9.7 percent to 2.8 million
metric tons this year, as farmers reduced tapping because of
wintering and as prices slumped, Asril Sutan Amir, chairman of
the Rubber Association of  Indonesia , said June 22. Rubber, used
in tires and gloves, has plunged about 12 percent this year
economic growth slowed in  China , the biggest consumer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
