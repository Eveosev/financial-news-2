New York Mets pitcher Matt Harvey,
the team’s first-round pick in the 2010 draft, will make his
Major League Baseball debut this week in  Arizona .  Harvey, a 23-year-old right-hander, is the No. 2 rated
prospect in the Mets’ organization, according to  MLB.com , and
had a 7-5 record with a 3.68 earned run average for Triple-A
Buffalo this season.  The Mets decided that Harvey will start their July 26 road
game against the Diamondbacks following yesterday’s loss to the
 Los Angeles Dodgers . New York opened a roster spot yesterday by
designating pitcher Miguel Batista for assignment.  Harvey was the seventh player drafted in 2010 and has
limited opponents to 97 hits in 110 innings in the minor leagues
this season, with 48 walks and 112 strikeouts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
