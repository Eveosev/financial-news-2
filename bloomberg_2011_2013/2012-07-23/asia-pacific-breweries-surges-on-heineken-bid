Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd. (APB)  surged
to a record in Singapore trading after  Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s
third-biggest brewer, offered as much as $6 billion for full
control of the maker of Tiger beer.  Asia Pacific Breweries rose as much as 18 percent to
S$49.50 before closing up 15 percent at S$48.49.  Fraser and
Neave Ltd ., or F&N, which owns a 40 percent stake in the beer
maker, gained 4.2 percent to S$7.92. The stocks were suspended
from trade on July 20.  Heineken, with 42 percent of Asia Pacific Breweries, or
APB, on Friday said it would pay as much as S$7.5 billion ($6
billion) to buy out other investors in the Singapore company at
S$50 a share, including the stake held by Fraser and Neave.
Heineken made the offer to protect its position after  Thai
Beverage Pcl (THBEV) , controlled by billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi ’s TCC group, offered to buy a 22 percent
stake in F&N, with his son-in-law’s company buying a stake in
APB.  Fraser & Neave, or F&N, said it’s considering the offer
from the Dutch company, though there’s no certainty that an
agreement will be reached.  Any deal would be the latest step in the consolidation of
the industry as brewers buy each other or seek full control of
joint ventures.  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI) , the world’s biggest
brewer with an 18 percent share of the market, bid $20.1 billion
for the remaining 50 percent of Grupo Modelo SAB last month,
tightening its hold on the Mexican market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
