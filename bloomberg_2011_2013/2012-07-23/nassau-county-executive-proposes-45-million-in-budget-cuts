Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano
proposed cutting 200 jobs, trimming capital projects and
canceling contracts to close a $45 million deficit in the $2.8
billion budget.  The job cuts, which would save an estimated $10 million,
require approval of the county Legislature, which is controlled
by Mangano’s fellow Republicans. About 60 employees took a
buyout, according to Brian Nevin, a spokesman for the county.  Nassau County, which borders the New York City borough of
Queens on  Long Island , has a median family household income of
more than $93,000, making it the state’s wealthiest county,
according to Census data. Its finances have been overseen by a
state board since 2011 after it failed to balance its budget.  Mangano has cut the payroll by almost 1,800 positions, or
20 percent, since taking office in 2010, Nevin said. He has
declined to raise property taxes to cut the deficit.  County Comptroller George Maragos on July 13  projected 
Nassau would end the fiscal year in December with a $45 million
deficit unless it took action to close the gap. Maragos, a
Republican, blamed part of the shortfall on Democrats in the
Legislature who wouldn’t approve borrowing to pay tax refunds.  Ron Stack, the chairman of the Nassau County Interim
Finance Authority, didn’t immediately respond to a telephone
call seeking comment. The oversight board has the power to
approve or disapprove contracts and borrowings and impose a wage
freeze.  To contact the reporter on this story:
