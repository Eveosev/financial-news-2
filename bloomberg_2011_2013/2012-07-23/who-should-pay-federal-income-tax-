The  Tax Foundation  (my former employer) has a  new report  out about the
increasing number of tax filers who don’t pay federal income tax. I don’t like
the foundation's effort to slap the “nonpayers” label on these people; it
suggests freeloading, even though most people who don’t pay federal income tax
do pay payroll tax and a variety of state and local taxes. Still, the rising
share of the population that is excluded from the federal income tax is an
important policy trend. Forty-one percent of federal income tax filers paid no income tax in 2010,
down from a record of 42 percent in 2009. While the income tax started out about
100 years ago as a narrow tax on very high earners, between 1950 and 2000 a
large majority of the population paid income taxes, with the share of non-paying
tax filers generally varying between 15 percent to 25 percent. Only since 2000
has that figure risen to the 30s and then the 40s. What changed in the last 15 years? Mostly, it’s a proliferation of tax
credits -- the  child tax credit  (created during the Clinton administration and
expanded under  George W. Bush ), tax credits for education, and, in 2009 and
2010, the Making Work Pay credit, which was simply a $400 per taxpayer credit
for most filers. These tax credits wipe out the total amount of income tax due
for an increasing number of tax filers. At the end of the report, you can see the effects by income range over the
period from 2001 to 2009. The biggest moves are in the middle. In 2001, only 7.2
percent of taxpayers making between $30,000 and $40,000 a year paid no federal
income tax. By 2009, that figure had risen to 33.4 percent.  For the $75,000 to
$100,000 range, the share went from 0.3 percent to 4.1 percent. 2009 was likely the peak year for filers paying no income tax, since the
Making Work Pay credit expired in 2011 and the economic recovery is raising
incomes. Still, levels in the 30s that we saw during the 2000s are likely the
new normal -- and lots of families that would have paid federal income tax under
the Clinton-era tax code now won’t. I don’t have a strong opinion on what percentage of taxpayers ought to pay
federal income tax. There are other ways to tax the middle class -- we could
even raise the  payroll tax  or impose a VAT while further increasing the share of
taxpayers who don’t pay income tax. On the other hand, I don’t think the tax
code of the 1990s was manifestly unjust, and it raised a lot more revenue than
the one we had today, in part by offering fewer income tax credits and
deductions. The rise in tax filers not paying income tax hasn’t, by itself, been a huge
hit to revenue -- most of these people would otherwise have had small tax bills.
But it is a symptom of the fact that we spent the 2000s giving away tax breaks
that weren’t affordable. Letting the entire Bush tax cuts expire once the
economy has recovered would be good fiscal policy, and it would also happen to
increase the share of tax filers who pay income tax. (Josh Barro is lead writer for the Ticker.  Follow  him on Twitter.) Read more breaking commentary from Josh Barro and other Bloomberg View
