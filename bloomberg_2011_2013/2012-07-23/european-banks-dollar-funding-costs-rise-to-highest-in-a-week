The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars rose for the second day to the highest level
in a week, according to a money market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 48 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:20 a.m. in
 London  from minus 47 on July 20, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The cost fell to a seven-week low of minus 44.5 basis
points on July 19.  The one-year basis swap was 53 basis points, or 0.53
percentage point, below Euribor. Three-month Euribor, the rate
 banks  say they see each other lending in euros, was set at a
record low 0.451 percent July 20.  The euro overnight indexed average, Eonia, was 11.5 basis
points, while an estimate of overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, the Eonia OIS swap, dropped to a record-low
9.2 basis points from 9.4 on July 20. Eonia is derived from a
daily survey of banks for the European Banking Federation.  Banks cut  overnight deposits  at the  European Central Bank 
for the fourth day, placing 349 billion euros ($422 billion)
with the Frankfurt-based ECB on July 20 from 357 billion euros
the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
