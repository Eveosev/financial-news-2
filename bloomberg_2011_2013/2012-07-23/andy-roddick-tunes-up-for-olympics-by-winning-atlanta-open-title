Andy Roddick  fought back to beat
 Gilles Muller  in the Atlanta Open tennis final and tune up for
the London Olympics by claiming his 32nd career title.  Roddick of the U.S. won 1-6, 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 yesterday to
secure his second tournament victory in his past three events.
He also won in Eastbourne, England, prior to Wimbledon, which
will host the Olympic tennis tournament starting July 28.  “I’ve won 32 times now and every one of them, I’ve never
assumed I was going to win again,” Roddick said in comments
distributed by the ATP World Tour. “I go through the process of
playing, work hard, and hope that I can put myself in position
enough times to create some success.”  Roddick, 29, improved to a  32-20 record  in finals. Muller,
a left-hander from Luxembourg appearing in his first final since
2005, fell to 0-3 in title matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
