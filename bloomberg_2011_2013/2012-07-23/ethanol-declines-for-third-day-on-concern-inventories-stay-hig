Ethanol declined for a third day on
speculation that production cuts aren’t enough to spur demand.  Futures fell following an Energy Department report July 18
that ethanol  stockpiles  rose to 19.6 million barrels even as
producers cut  output  to the lowest level in at least two years.
Higher corn costs brought on by drought have cut margins.  “Ethanol has seen a huge drop in production, but yet
stocks are steady,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL
FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 5.4 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $2.651 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest price since July 13 and the biggest decline
since June 1. Prices have gained 20 percent this year.  There are 42 gallons in a barrel of ethanol, so 19.6
million is the equivalent of about 823 million gallons.
Blackford estimates that inventories need to fall to about 750
million gallons in order to stoke demand.  Corn for December delivery fell 10.25 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $7.855 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Producers are losing 35 cents on each gallon of the biofuel
made, based on the September contracts for corn and ethanol,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
