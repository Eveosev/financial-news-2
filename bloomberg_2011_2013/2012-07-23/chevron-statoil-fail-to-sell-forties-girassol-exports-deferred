Chevron Corp. and Statoil ASA failed
to sell  North Sea  Forties crude even after they lowered their
offers from the end of last week. No bids or offers were made
for Russian Urals in  Europe .  Nigeria,  Africa ’s largest oil producer, plans to reduce
exports of benchmark Qua Iboe crude to 10 cargoes of 950,000
barrels each in September, two less than August, a loading plan
obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Crude exports scheduled for July and August from Total SA’s
Girassol field in  Angola  are being delayed after an incident.  North Sea  Chevron offered a Forties cargo for Aug. 5 to Aug. 7
loading at parity to Dated Brent, compared with a premium of 25
cents on July 20, while Statoil failed to sell at 5 cents more
than the benchmark for Aug. 10 to Aug. 12, down 15 cents from
the previous session, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
and brokers monitoring the Platts trading window.  BP Plc didn’t manage to sell Forties for Aug. 13 to Aug. 15
at 25 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc was unable to sell at a premium of 10 cents for Aug. 7
to Aug. 9, the survey showed.  Vitol Group failed to buy Forties for Aug. 14 to Aug. 18 at
5 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, while Phibro, a unit of
Occidental Petroleum Corp., didn’t find sellers for the blend
for Aug. 13 to Aug. 18 at a discount of 15 cents, according to
the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 3 cents a barrel less
than Dated Brent, the lowest since July 3, compared with a
premium of 4 cents on July 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for September settlement traded at $103.62 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $106.50 on July 20. The October contract was
at $102.86, a discount of 76 cents to September.  Cnooc Ltd.  agreed to pay $15.1 billion in cash to acquire
 Canada ’s Nexen Inc. in the biggest overseas takeover by a
Chinese company. Nexen operates the Buzzard field, the biggest
in the Forties system.  China ’s largest offshore oil and gas explorer is paying
$27.50 for each common share, a premium of 61 percent to
Calgary-based Nexen’s closing price on July 20, according to its
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Nexen’s board
recommended the deal to its shareholders.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was 55 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent in
northwest Europe, the lowest since July 2, compared with a
discount of 25 cents on July 20, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold two Urals crude cargoes of 100,000
metric tons each via a tender to Repsol YPF SA for loading from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk, according to three traders who
participate in the market.  One shipment is for Aug. 4 to Aug. 5 and the other for Aug.
8 to Aug. 9, according to the people, who declined to be
identified because the information is confidential.  West Africa  Nigeria  plans to reduce exports of benchmark Bonny Light
crude to five cargoes of 950,000 barrels each in September,
according to a loading plan.  The nation will also export six shipments of Forcados, four
Brass River, four Usan, three Antan, two Abo, one lot each of
EA, Okwori and Pennington, separate plans showed. Cargo sizes
range from 300,000 barrels to 950,000 barrels.  Total, which operates the Girassol field, declared force
majeure from July 17 to July 19 after a “a minor technical
incident”, Florent Segura, a spokesman for the company, said by
phone today from Paris. Force majeure protects a company from
liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond
its control.  Girassol cargoes for loading in the second half of July
were deferred by six to seven days and those for August were
delayed by three to four days, according to the loading program.  CPC Corp., a Taiwan state-owned oil company, issued a
tender to buy low-sulfur crude oil for loading in September, a
document obtained by Bloomberg News shows. The tender closes at
10 a.m. local time on July 24, with offers valid until 7 p.m. on
July 26.  Qua Iboe for loading from Nigeria rose 2 cents to $1.12 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
