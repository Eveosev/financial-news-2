Strabag SE (STR)  placed the lowest offer
in the Slovak government’s tender to build a 6.5-kilometer (4
miles) highway section,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported without
saying where it got the information.  Strabag asked 26 million euros ($31 million) to build the
road, followed by Sweden’s  Skanska AB (SKAB)  with a 28 million-euro
offer, the newspaper reported. The results of the contest are
yet to be officially announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
