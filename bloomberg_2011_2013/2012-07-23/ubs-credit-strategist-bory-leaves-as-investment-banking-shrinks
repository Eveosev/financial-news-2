George Bory left his post as global
head of credit strategy at UBS AG this month as the lender
reduces its investment bank by half.  Megan Stinson, a New York-based spokeswoman for
Switzerland’s largest bank, confirmed Bory’s departure. The
strategist, who worked out of the  Stamford , Connecticut, office,
left almost two weeks ago, according to a person familiar with
the move who asked not to be identified because the change
hasn’t been announced.  Stinson declined to comment beyond the departure. UBS is
shrinking its investment bank by almost half, according to a
Nov. 17 investor  presentation , as stricter  capital requirements 
and Europe’s debt crisis put pressure on profit.  Bory didn’t respond to a phone message and e-mails seeking
comment. UBS is based in Zurich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
