Dam builder  Zhejiang Reclaim (002586) 
Construction and Zhejiang Dragon Pipe Manufacturing Co. led
waterworks companies higher in Chinese trading after record
rains left at 37 people dead.  The 16-hour rainstorm that started July 21 dumped as much
as 16 inches of rain in Beijing, the most since records were
first kept 60 years ago. It caused 10 billion yuan ($1.6
billion) in flood damage, the China Daily newspaper said.  As Chinese television highlighted images of the flooding,
the storm spurred criticism on China’s micro-blog services that
city drainage systems were ill-equipped to handle the deluge
even after infrastructure upgrades and a stimulus package in the
world’s second-largest economy.  Speculation that the damage could lead to new
infrastructure projects boosted pump-maker  Zhejiang Leo (002131)  Co.,
which rose 10 percent to 10.73  yuan  in Shenzhen, its biggest
gain since April 25.  Ningxia Qinglong Pipes Industry Co. (002457)  climbed
5.6 percent to 7.95 yuan, the most since May 29 on a day when
the Shenzhen Composite Index fell 1 percent.  Zhejiang Reclaim jumped 6 percent to 15.62 yuan in
Shenzhen, its biggest gain since June 27. Zhejiang Dragon Pipe
advanced 10 percent to 11.58 yuan, the most since July 6.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
