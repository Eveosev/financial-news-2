The  Standard & Poor’s  GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities fell 2.8 percent to 633.47 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials dropped 2
percent to 1,542.739.  CRUDE OIL  Oil plunged the most this year on concern that Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis is deepening and as a Chinese central-bank
adviser said the country’s economic expansion may slow further.  Crude oil for September delivery fell $3.69, or 4 percent,
to $88.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was
the biggest decrease for a front-month contract since Dec. 14.  Brent oil for September settlement declined $3.57, or 3.3
percent, to $103.26 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline slid on concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
deepening and  China ’s economic growth is slowing, threatening
global demand for fuel.  August-delivery gasoline declined 6.01 cents, or 2 percent,
to settle at $2.8829 a gallon on the Nymex. The more actively
traded September contract sank 2.8 percent to $2.7638.  August-delivery heating oil slid 10.54 cents, or 3.6
percent, to $2.8189 a gallon. It was the largest decline since
Aug. 8, when futures dropped 4.8 percent after Standard & Poor’s
downgraded  U.S. debt . The more actively traded September
contract fell 3.5 percent to $2.8206.  NATURAL GAS  Natural-gas futures rose for a fourth day in New York to a
seven-month high on forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather
that may boost demand for the fuel from  power plants .  Gas for August delivery climbed 3.6 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $3.117 per million British thermal units on the Nymex, the
highest settlement price since Dec. 22. Gas is up 4.3 percent
this year.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures fell to the lowest price in more than a week
as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is deepening boosted the
dollar and curbed demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  Gold futures for August delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,577.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York, after touching
$1,562, the lowest price for a most-active contract since July
12. The price slid 0.6 percent last week and is down 1.7 percent
this month.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 1 percent to
$27.042 an ounce in New York, the biggest fall since July 10.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 1.1 percent to $1,398.90 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery declined 0.9 percent to
$570.95 an ounce.  BASE METALS  Copper futures fell to a three-week low as Europe’s
deepening debt crisis diminished prospects for metals demand.  Copper futures for September delivery declined 2 percent to
settle at $3.38 a pound on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
metal slipped to $3.342, the lowest price for a most-active
contract since June 29.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months slid 1.9 percent to $7,401 a metric ton ($3.36 a pound).  Aluminum, zinc, lead, tin and nickel also dropped in
London.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures dropped on signs of increasing supplies and
sagging demand. Cattle prices rose.  Warehouses held 591.7 million pounds (268,384 metric tons)
of pork as of June 30, up 20 percent from a year earlier, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in a report released after
the close of regular trading on July 20. Output of the meat in
the six months through June 30 rose 2.6 percent from the same
period in 2011, USDA data show.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 1.2 percent to
settle at 78.85 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices are down 6.5 percent this year.  Cattle futures for October delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
close at $1.235 a pound in Chicago. The commodity has gained 1.7
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell 0.3
percent to $1.3565 a pound.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Sugar fell from a 16-week high on concern that the crisis
in Europe will crimp demand for commodities, including the
sweetener. Coffee, cotton and orange juice also declined, while
cocoa gained.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.1 percent to settle
at 23.89 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after
reaching 24 cents, the highest level since March 29.  Also on ICE, arabica coffee futures for September delivery

percent to $1.094 a pound in New York. Prices have dropped for
10 straight sessions.  Cocoa futures for September delivery climbed 0.4 percent to
$2,238 a metric ton on ICE.  GRAINS  Corn and soybean futures tumbled from records on
speculation that Europe’s crisis may curb demand after prices
surged amid the worst U.S. drought in 56 years. Wheat also
slumped.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.3 percent to
settle at $7.855 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The
price has gained 24 percent this month.  Soybean futures for November delivery plunged 64 cents, or
3.8 percent, to $16.2225 a bushel, the biggest drop for a most-
active contract since Sept. 30. Last week, the oilseed jumped
8.6 percent, the most since October.  Wheat futures for September delivery fell 3.2 percent to
$9.1275 a bushel. The price climbed in the previous eight
