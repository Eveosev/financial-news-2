All-Star right wing Rick Nash, who
was a focus of discussions at the National Hockey League trading
deadline in February, finally is making a move.  Nash was traded to the  New York  Rangers from the Columbus
Blue Jackets yesterday for three players and a first-round draft
pick, the teams said.  The 6-foot-4, 220-pound right wing was acquired in exchange
for forwards Artem Anisimov,  Brandon Dubinsky , defenseman Tim Erixon and the pick.  The Rangers also received defenseman Steven Delisle and a
conditional third-round draft pick in 2013 from Columbus, the
Blue Jackets said.  Nash, the first player chosen in the 2002 NHL draft, had 30
goals and 29 assists in 82 games with Columbus last season, the
sixth season he has scored at least 30 goals.  Nash, 28, is going into the third year of an eight-year,
$62.4 million contract.  The trade is contingent on all players passing a physical.  To contact the reporter on this story:
