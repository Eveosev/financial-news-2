Mexico ’s peso fell the most since
May as concern that Europe’s debt crisis is growing more acute
damped demand for higher-yielding assets.  The peso dropped 1.7 percent, the most since May 30, to
13.5877 per dollar. The loss pared its rally this year to 2.5
percent, the second-biggest among the most-traded currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. It touched 13.5887 in intraday trading,
the weakest level since June 29. Mexico’s central bank sold $281
million today in a dollar auction designed to limit the peso’s
volatility.  Most emerging-market currencies tumbled before a meeting of
 Greece ’s creditors this week. German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s “very skeptical” that European leaders will
be able to rescue Greece. Speculation that the European crisis
would hurt the market for Mexican exports helped make the peso
Latin America’s worst-performing major currency in 2011.  “It’s just  risk aversion ,” said  Gabriel Casillas , the
chief economist and head of research at Grupo Financiero Banorte
SAB. The currency’s liquidity and high-trading volumes mean that
“whenever you want to reduce risk in  emerging markets  the peso
is always a very easy way to do it,” he said by phone from
Mexico City.  The central bank sold dollars for an average 13.5607 pesos
each, according to its website. Since November, it has been
offering $400 million daily at an  exchange rate  that’s at least
2 percent weaker than the previous day’s official fix level.
Today’s sale was the biggest since the nation’s currency
exchange commission announced the program on Nov. 29. The bank
sold $107 million on May 31 and $258 million on May 23 in the
only other two sales so far under the program.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.15 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.55
centavo to 144.4 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
