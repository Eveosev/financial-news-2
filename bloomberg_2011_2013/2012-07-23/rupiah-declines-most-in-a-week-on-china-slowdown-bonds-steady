Indonesia ’s rupiah touched a four-
week low and  government bonds  declined on concern growth in the
world’s second-largest economy may slow further, reducing
appetite for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped to a one-
week low after Song Guoqing, a Chinese central bank adviser,
said on July 21 that growth may slow to 7.4 percent this quarter
from 7.6 percent in the previous three-month period.  China  is
the largest market for Indonesian exports.  “Negative external sentiment still weighs on the rupiah,”
said Gusti Kahari, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Artha
Graha Internasional in Jakarta. “The rupiah has room to
strengthen as Indonesia is still relatively attractive in terms
of risk-reward.”  The rupiah weakened 0.1 percent to 9,460 per dollar as of
3:36 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. The currency touched 9,519 earlier, the lowest
level since June 25. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 8
percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.78
percent, according to prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association. That was the biggest advance since May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
