IAC/InterActiveCorp acquired a
controlling stake in the Newsweek/Daily Beast Co., a media
company formed last year from the merger of an online news
startup and Newsweek magazine.  “We’ve acquired a controlling interest and it’s not
material to our earnings,” said Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman
for New York-based IAC. Reuters previously reported on the move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
