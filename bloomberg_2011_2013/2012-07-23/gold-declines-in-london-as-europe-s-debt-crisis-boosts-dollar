Gold futures fell to the lowest
price in more than a week as concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis
is deepening boosted the dollar and curbed demand for the metal
as an alternative investment.  The dollar rose to a two-year high against the euro as the
cost of insuring against default on Spanish government debt
climbed to a record.  Greece ’s creditors meet this week amid
doubts that the country will meet its bailout commitments.
German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s “very
skeptical” that European leaders will be able to rescue Greece.  “The Europe concerns are back, and we are seeing a flight
to cash,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“The stronger dollar is working against gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell 0.3 percent to settle
at $1,577.40 an ounce at 1:49 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
after touching $1,562, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 12. The price slid 0.6 percent last week and is down
1.7 percent this month.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-
traded product backed by gold, fell 15.1 metric tons last week,
or 1.2 percent, the largest drop since Dec. 23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
slumped as much as 3.3 percent, heading for the biggest fall
since July 6.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 1 percent to
$27.042 an ounce in New York, the biggest fall since July 10.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 1.1 percent to $1,398.90 an ounce.
