Euro-area  consumer confidence  fell
to the lowest in almost three years in July, suggesting the
economy may struggle to gain momentum in the current quarter.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
declined to minus 21.6 from minus 19.8 in June, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today. That’s
the lowest since August 2009. Economists had forecast a drop to
minus 20, the median of 23 estimates in a  Bloomberg survey 
showed.  Europe ’s economy is edging toward its second recession in
three years after budget cuts from  Spain  to Ireland prompted
companies to eliminate jobs and eroded  consumer spending . Euro-
area services and manufacturing industries probably contracted
for a sixth month in July, a Bloomberg survey shows ahead of
tomorrow’s release.  The commission is scheduled to publish the wider indicator
of euro-area economic confidence on July 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
