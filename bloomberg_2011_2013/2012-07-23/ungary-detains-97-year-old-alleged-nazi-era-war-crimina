Hungary is preparing legislation
that would restrict land ownership from 2014, when foreigners
will become eligible to buy farmland,  Magyar Hirlap  reported,
citing an interview with Rural Development Minister Sandor Fazekas.  “The most important is that only local farmers can be
owners” of the land, Fazekas told the newspaper, according to a
transcript of the interview published today.  Legal entities will be barred from owning land while
authorities will be able to “block, by the use of indirect
tools such as the system of issuing permits, the acquisition of
Hungarian land by those who aren’t eligible,” according to
Magyar Hirlap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
