China’s stocks  fell, dragging the
benchmark index down to the lowest level since March 2009, after
a central bank adviser said economic growth will slow this
quarter and as  Europe ’s crisis worsened the outlook for exports.  Jiangxi Copper Co. (600362)  and China Shenhua Energy Co. led a
decline among commodity producers on concern weaker growth will
sap demand for raw materials.  China Pacific Insurance (Group)
Co. (601601) , the nation’s fourth-largest insurer, dropped 2.2 percent
after funds controlled by Carlyle Group LP offered to sell its
Hong Kong-listed shares. Weichai Power Co., a maker of high-
speed heavy-duty  diesel engines , slumped the most since November
2010 after estimating a drop in second-quarter profit.  “The economy is still on a downtrend and that means
corporate earnings could be worse than expected,” said Wu Kan,
a Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance Co., which
oversees $285 million. “The government is slow to respond to
the economic slowdown and the market is disappointed at the
magnitude of pro-growth measures.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.3 percent to
2,141.40 at the close, the lowest level since March 13, 2009.
The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slumped 1.4 percent to 2,365.43. The  Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed
Chinese companies, retreated 0.6 percent in  New York  on July 20.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai index was at 15.1
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.9. About 6.4
billion shares changed hands in the gauge on July 20, 23 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  Slower 3Q Growth  The Shanghai Composite fell 0.8 percent last week on
concern earnings will deteriorate and as the government said it
won’t ease property curbs. The measure has fallen 13 percent
from this year’s high on March 2 amid concern an economic
slowdown is deepening. It’s valued at 9.5 times estimated
profit, compared with the average of 17.5 since Bloomberg began
compiling the  data  in 2006.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal, lost
3.2 percent to 21.89  yuan . Shenhua, the nation’s largest coal
producer, slid 1.3 percent to 21.96 yuan.  Aluminum Corp. of
China Ltd. , the listed unit of nation’s biggest maker of the
lightweight metal, retreated 1.5 percent to 6.04 yuan.  China’s economic growth may cool to 7.4 percent this
quarter, Song Guoqing, a member of the People’s Bank of China
monetary policy committee, said at a forum in Beijing over the
weekend. He also warned that a decline in producer prices in
tandem with consumer inflation may hurt investment returns of
industrial companies, damping their desire to expand.  ‘More Pessimistic’  “The consensus is that China’s economic growth rate will
be close to 8 percent in coming months, but I personally am more
pessimistic because there are problems on the export side,”
Song said. With Europe’s debt crisis still unfolding, “there is
a risk of insufficient government measures if Chinese exports
fall more sharply than expected in coming months,” he said.  The world’s second-largest economy grew 7.6 percent in the
second quarter, the least in three years. Import and export
growth both slowed last month.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are scheduled to
release their preliminary manufacturing index for this month
tomorrow. The reading was at 48.2 in June, below the 50 dividing
line for expansion and contraction.  In Europe, German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said he’s
“very skeptical” that European leaders will be able to rescue
 Greece . Roesler, who is  Germany ’s economy minister, told
broadcaster ARD that Greece was unlikely to be able to meet its
obligations under a euro-area bailout program as its
international creditors hold talks this week in  Athens . Should
that be the case, the country won’t receive more bailout
payments, Roesler said.  Carlyle Sale  Europe is China’s largest export market, making up 18
percent of the nation’s overseas sales, according to Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co.  China Pacific dropped 2.2 percent to 22.81 yuan. Carlyle
Holdings Mauritius Ltd. and Parallel Investors Holdings Ltd. are
selling 220 million shares in the insurer for HK$25.5 to HK$26
($3.35) each, according to terms for the sale obtained by
Bloomberg News. The selling price represents a discount of as
much as 5.2 percent to the stock’s closing price in  Hong Kong  on
July 20. The Hong Kong shares plunged as much as 12 percent.  Weichai Power slumped 7.9 percent to 23.69 yuan. First-half
profit may have declined by about the same rate in the first
quarter because of China’s macro-economic policy and the
slowdown, the company said in a statement on July 20 after the
market closed. Net income fell 45 percent in the first quarter.  CSRC Measure  Chinese publicly traded companies are required to release
first-half earnings results in July and August. Of the 885
companies in the Shanghai Composite, the 20 that reported
second-quarter earnings had an average 3.3 percent profit
decline, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Profit rose
2.8 percent in the first quarter, the data showed.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission will further
reduce commission charges for securities trading by as much as
20 percent, the Shanghai Securities News reported on its website
on July 20, citing an unidentified CSRC official. The CSRC will
announce a detailed plan by Sept. 1, it said.  Citic Securities Co. (600030) , the nation’s biggest listed
brokerage, tumbled 41 percent to 12.30 yuan. Citic agreed to buy
Credit Agricole SA’s CLSA unit for $1.25 billion, joining banks
across  Asia  acquiring the assets of troubled European financial
firms.  Zhejiang Reclaim Construction Group Co. led gains among
Chinese waterworks companies after the government allocated 120
million yuan ($18.8 million) for rainstorm relief and repairs
after flooding in Beijing over the weekend.  Beijing Rainstorm  Zhejiang Reclaim, a dam builder, jumped 6 percent to 15.62
yuan, the biggest gain since June 27.  Zhejiang Dragon Pipe
Manufacturing Co. (002629)  surged by the 10 percent daily limit to 11.58
yuan. Ningxia Qinglong Pipes Industry Co. climbed 5.6 percent to
7.95 yuan.  The rainstorm, the heaviest since records were first kept
60 years ago, killed 37 people and caused 10 billion yuan of
losses, while about 80,000 travelers were stranded after their
flights were delayed, the  China  Daily newspaper said.
Authorities evacuated 56,933 people, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.  Chinese stocks fell for a third week in New York before
Internet companies from Baidu Inc. to Ctrip.com International
Ltd. report second-quarter earnings that analysts estimate will
show slower profit growth. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index
of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S. sank 1.9 percent
last week.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
