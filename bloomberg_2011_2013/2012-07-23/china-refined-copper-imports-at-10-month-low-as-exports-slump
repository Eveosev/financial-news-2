China ’s refined copper imports in
June dropped to the lowest level since August as demand for
using the metal as a financing tool shrank. Exports also fell.  Inbound  shipments  were 250,097 metric tons last month,
compared with 301,990 in May, according to data e-mailed by the
General Administration of Customs today. Exports tumbled to
35,477 tons from 102,375 tons in May, the highest since at least
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China has cut  interest rates  twice and reserve requirement
ratio three times this year to bolster the growth, which has
slowed to a three-year low of 7.6 percent in the second quarter.
Lower imports may help absorb local  inventories , as those
tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed for five weeks
in a row to 160,973 tons last week, the highest in two months.  “Shrinking demand for using copper to finance is one of
the main reasons for the drop,” said Fang Junfeng, an analyst
at Shanghai CIFCO Futures Co. “Weak downstream demand and
unprofitable arbitrage trade also contributed to the decline.”  Arbitrage traders reap profits by exploiting price
differentials in two places. Three-month copper on the London
Metal Exchange fell as much as 1.1 percent to $7,460 a ton today,
the lowest since June 29, about $222 higher than its counterpart
in  Shanghai , including a 17 percent value-added tax.  Barclays Plc lowered its price forecast for this year to
$8,120 a ton on July 12, and estimates demand will exceed supply
by 139,000 tons, less than its previous estimate of 207,000 tons.  Copper concentrate  imports  were 480,680 tons in June,
compared with 667,904 tons, while arrivals in the first half
gained 15 percent form a year ago to 3.38 million tons, today’s
customs data showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
