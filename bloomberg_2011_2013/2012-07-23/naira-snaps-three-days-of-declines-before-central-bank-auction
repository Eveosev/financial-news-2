The naira appreciated, snapping
three days of declines against the dollar, on slower demand for
the U.S. currency before the central bank’s auction.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer gained 0.2
percent to 161.3200 per dollar as of 11:32 a.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The appreciation is as a result of reduced dollar demand
as many traders anticipate the currency may be well supported by
central bank sales at today’s auction,” Tunde Ladipo, chief
executive officer of Lagos-based Valuechain Investment Ltd.,
which trades currencies, said by phone today.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sells foreign-currency on
Mondays and Wednesdays to lenders at auctions to stabilize the
naira. The regulator sold $500 million at its auctions last
week, after selling $343.5 million the previous week, according
to data on its website.  “The naira has settled below 162 to a dollar owing to
sustained central bank support,” Celeste Fauconnier and Nema Ramkhelawan-Bhana, strategists at Rand Merchant Bank, wrote in a
report today.  The country’s foreign-currency reserves have fallen by $1.3
billion since the end of May to $36.371 billion, according to
July 19 data compiled by the Abuja-based central bank.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7-year domestic bonds due June 2019
fell 19 basis points to 16.17 percent, according to July 20 data
on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell one basis
point to 5.429 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated for a third day, sliding 0.2
percent to 1.9575 per dollar in Accra, the capital, the lowest
since at least 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
