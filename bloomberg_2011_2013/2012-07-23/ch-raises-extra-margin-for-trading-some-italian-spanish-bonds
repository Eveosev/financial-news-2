LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest
clearing house, raised the extra deposit it demands from clients
to trade some Spanish and Italian government bonds, it said
today in a  statement  on its website.  The margin for trading  Spain ’s securities maturing in seven
to 10 years will increase to 12.2 percent from 11.8 percent,
according to the statement. For debt due in 10 to 15 years it
will climb to 16 percent from 14.7 percent, and for 15- to 30-
year bonds, the charge will be 20 percent, up from 17.9 percent.  Spain’s government bonds plunged today, pushing 10-year
yields to a euro-era record of 7.57 percent, amid concern the
nation will need to offer financial support to its regions.
Rates on similar-maturity Italian debt jumped as much as 26
basis points, or 0.26 percentage point, to 6.43 percent, the
highest since January.  For Italian debt, LCH will raise margins for securities due
in two to 3.25 years, seven to 10 years and 15 to 30 years, LCH
said. The rates for the latter will increase to 20 percent from
18 percent.  The changes are effective at the market close today and
will be reflected in margin calls tomorrow, LCH said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
