Brazilian swap rates declined as
 Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing growth in  China  overshadowed
data showing analysts covering Latin America’s largest economy
raised their 2012 inflation forecast for a second week.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2014 fell six
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.69 percent at 9:35
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 1 percent to 2.0436 per
 U.S. dollar , its second day of declines.  Commodities tumbled as this week’s visit by  Greece ’s
creditors rekindled concern the euro currency union will
splinter and after officials in China, Brazil’s biggest trading
partner, said growth may cool to 7.4 percent this quarter.
Consumer prices in Latin America’s biggest economy will rise
4.92 percent this year, according to a central bank survey of
about 100 analysts published today, up from last week’s 4.87
percent median estimate.  “People are worried about the situation with the euro and
the question of China is weighing on commodities,” Luis Otavio de Souza Leal, chief economist at Banco ABC Brasil SA, said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “Rate futures are following the external
market.”  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini will hold a
conference call with international media to comment on Brazil’s
economic performance at 12 p.m. local time.  -- Editors: Brendan Walsh, Richard Richtmyer  To contact the reporters on this story:
