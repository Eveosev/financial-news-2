Egypt  today released 457 civilian
prisoners who were convicted by military courts, according to
Mohamed Eliwa, head of the media division at the prisons
department.  The move came after President Mohamed Mursi issued a decree
last week pardoning 572 such prisoners. The other 115 were
referred to the relevant state security directorates over
“other cases,” Eliwa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
