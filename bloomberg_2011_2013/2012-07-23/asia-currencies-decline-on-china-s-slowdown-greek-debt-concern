Asian currencies weakened after a
central bank adviser forecast  China’s economy  will slow further
and concern mounted that Greece won’t meet bailout targets,
sapping demand for emerging-market assets.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index fell by the most
in more than a week after Song Guoqing, an academic member of
the People’s Bank of China monetary policy committee, said on
July 21 that economic expansion may cool for a seventh quarter
to 7.4 percent in the three months through September. German
Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said yesterday he’s “very
skeptical” that European leaders will be able to rescue Greece.  “Risk sentiment is relatively weak today and is largely
influenced by external factors,” said Tohru Nishihama, an
economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in Tokyo.
“Many Asian nations depend on exports, so external concerns are
weighing on the regional currencies.”  India’s rupee slumped 1 percent to 55.9012 per dollar as of
1:48 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Malaysia ’s ringgit dropped 0.7 percent to 3.1734, South  Korea ’s
won declined 0.5 percent to 1,146.55 and Thailand’s baht
weakened 0.3 percent to 31.76. The Asia Dollar Index lost 0.3
percent to 114.65, with its 60-day historical volatility at 3.71
percent from 3.66 percent on July 20.  China  is the biggest export market for South Korea,  Taiwan 
and Thailand and the second-largest for Malaysia. Overseas sales
account for about two-thirds of Taiwan and Thailand’s economies
and about half of Korea’s.  Thai Exports  Thailand may report on July 25 that export growth slowed to
4.5 percent last month from 7.7 percent in May, based on the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. South Korea
may say a day after that its economy expanded 2.5 percent in the
second quarter, compared with a 2.8 percent pace in the previous
three months, according to a separate Bloomberg poll.  The won weakened for a second day as the benchmark  Kospi (KOSPI) 
index of shares lost 1.8 percent, the most since July 12.  “Europe’s debt crisis still remains a cause of worry for
global markets,” said Kim Sung Soo, chief currency dealer at
Industrial Bank of Korea in Seoul. “The slide in stock markets
points to where the currencies are headed. Month-end exporter
deals, however, may help put a floor under the won.”  China’s  yuan  declined to the lowest level since October as
the central bank weakened the daily  reference rate  by 0.25
percent, the most since June 25. The currency’s exchange rate is
“very close” to equilibrium as foreign-exchange reserves are
stable,  Yi Gang , head of the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange, said in Beijing on July 21. The yuan fell 0.21 percent
to 6.3871 per dollar today, taking its decline this month to
0.52 percent.  Chinese Rebound Expected  “It’s a risk-off move and China has set a weaker fixing to
accommodate the yuan spot’s decline,” said Eddie Cheung, an
analyst at Standard Chartered Plc in  Hong Kong . “We still
expect a rebound in the economy in the second half as policy
makers have the tools to stimulate growth.”  The ringgit fell by the most in a month. The economy will
grow 4.2 percent this year and 4.7 percent in 2013, the
Malaysian Institute of  Economic Research  said July 17, after
Prime Minister Najib Razak said the same day the country must
have expansion of 5 percent to 6 percent annually to avoid
facing “many problems”.  “The negative headlines in the  euro zone  caused the dollar
to strengthen across the board,” said Sim Moh Siong, a currency
strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. “China’s slowing economic
growth is still a lingering concern.”  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso dropped 0.5 percent to
42.058 per dollar and the  Taiwan dollar  declined 0.3 percent to
NT$30.095. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.1 percent to 9,460 and the
Vietnamese dong was little changed at 20,853.  To contact the reporter on this story:
