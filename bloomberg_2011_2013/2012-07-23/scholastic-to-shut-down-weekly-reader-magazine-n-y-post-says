Scholastic (SCHL)  Corp. will cease
publication of the  Weekly Reader , a magazine circulated in
classrooms since 1902, after buying it earlier this year, the
New York Post  reported .  Scholastic, publisher of the Hunger Games books, plans to
fold the magazine into Scholastic News and fire 55 of 60 Weekly
Reader employees in  White Plains , New York, the newspaper said.
The Post didn’t say where it got the information on job cuts.  The New York-based company agreed to buy the Weekly Reader
from Reader’s Digest Association Inc. in February, the Post
said. Weekly Reader’s circulation fell from 1 million in 1990 to
less than two-thirds of that, the Post said. At its peak, Weekly
Reader had 13 million subscribers, according to the newspaper.  Combining the Weekly Reader and Scholastic News will result
in “a better news and information experience in print and
digital formats for teachers and students,” Cathy Lasiewicz, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg. She
declined to comment on the job-cut numbers, saying some Weekly
Reader employees joined the company, others are candidates for
positions and some weren’t interested in commuting to
Scholastic’s  New York  offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
