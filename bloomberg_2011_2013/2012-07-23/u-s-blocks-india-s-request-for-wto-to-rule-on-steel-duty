The U.S. blocked a request by  India 
for World Trade Organization judges to investigate the legality
of American countervailing duties on some Indian steel products.
A second request would be automatically accepted.  India  complained  at the Geneva-based WTO on April 24,
saying U.S. anti-subsidy duties on certain hot-rolled carbon-
steel flat products violate global trade rules. India is
challenging a U.S. finding that Indian steel producers got an
illegal subsidy by paying too little for  iron ore  from a state-
owned producer.  The U.S. first imposed the tariff in December 2001 and
extended it six years later. The duty is fixed at 102.7 percent,
according to a notification submitted by the U.S. to the WTO.
The two governments held consultations in an unsuccessful bid to
resolve the dispute without resorting to a panel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
