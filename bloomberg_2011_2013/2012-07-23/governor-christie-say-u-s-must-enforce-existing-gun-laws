New Jersey Governor  Chris Christie 
said the U.S. has enough gun regulation and that he is
“disturbed” by the politicizing of the Colorado movie theater
massacre.  Christie, 49, a first-term Republican, told reporters in
Trenton today that he agrees with President  Barack Obama  on gun
regulation.  “It’s time for us to address and enforce the gun laws that
we have, which I think we do fairly well here in this state,”
Christie said. “I am a little bit disturbed by politicians who
in the immediate aftermath of this type of tragedy try to
grandstand, and I’m not going to be one of those people. I feel
awfully for those families.”  Twelve people were killed and 58 injured in the July 20
mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater. The
massacre increased calls from elected officials, including  New
York  Mayor  Michael Bloomberg , for tougher gun laws, as it has
after other high-profile shootings. The mayor is founder and
majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.  The suspect in the Colorado shootings, James Holmes, 24,
appeared for an initial hearing in court today, where Judge
William Sylvester advised him of his rights and said he was
suspected of first-degree murder. Formal charges are pending a
July 30 court date.  Obama “believes that we need to take common-sense measures
that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans, while
ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law
do not get them,” White House press secretary  Jay Carney  told
reporters aboard Air Force One on July 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
