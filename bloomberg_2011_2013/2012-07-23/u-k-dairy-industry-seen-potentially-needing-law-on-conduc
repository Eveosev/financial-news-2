The U.K. may need legislation
governing relations between dairy farmers, who face losses after
milk-price cuts, and processors if the two sides are unable to
agree on a voluntary conduct code, a lawmaker  wrote .  The government’s failure to help processors and farmers
institute a voluntary code of conduct for setting out contracts
is “unacceptable,” Anne McIntosh, chair of Parliament’s
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, wrote in a  letter 
today to Agriculture Minister Jim Paice. The voluntary code
should address prices, volumes, duration and timing of milk
deliveries, she wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
