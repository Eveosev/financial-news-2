U.K. stocks  tumbled, for the FTSE
100 Index’s biggest two-day selloff since May, as banks slumped
amid renewed concern the euro area has yet to contain its
sovereign-debt crisis.  Barclays Plc and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  both slid
more than 3 percent as Spanish bond yields surged to a euro-era
record amid a report that more regions in Spain may ask for aid.
 Xstrata Plc (XTA)  fell 3.3 percent as copper declined.  The FTSE 100 lost 117.9, or 2.1 percent, to 5,533.87 at the
close in London as all 101 companies in the gauge fell. The
broader FTSE All-Share Index also retreated 2.1 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index sank 2.2 percent.  “The euro crisis has intensified in Madrid,” said Joshua Raymond, chief market strategist at  City Index  in London, in an
e-mail. “The moves in Spanish bond yields over the last 48
hours of trading have been a big concern in the markets and a
key catalyst for a bearish turn in equities.”  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  dropped last week fell from an 11-week high
after Spain said its recession will extend into next year and
the region of Valencia said it would tap an emergency-loan fund.  Spain’s 10-year bond yield  climbed 23 basis points to 7.50
percent today, the most since the single currency began in 1999,
after El Pais reported that six Spanish regions may ask for aid
from the central government.  Spain’s Regions  Murcia will request a bailout from Spain’s liquidity fund,
El Pais reported today, citing unidentified government officials
in the region. The local government faces 433 million euros
($525 million) in debt redemptions in the second half, the
newspaper said.  Yields on securities with similar maturities in Italy,
France and Greece also climbed following a report in Der Spiegel
that the  International Monetary Fund  will stop paying rescue aid
to Greece. The magazine cited unidentified European Union
officials.  Greece’s creditors meet this week amid doubts that the
country will meet its bailout commitments. Germany’s Vice
Chancellor, Philipp Roesler, said that “if Greece doesn’t
fulfill those conditions, then there can be no more payments.”  The troika of international creditors -- the European
Commission, the  European Central Bank  and the IMF -- will arrive
in Athens tomorrow.  Short Selling  U.K. banks and insurers dropped as Italy and Spain
reinstated short-selling bans on stocks. Spain’s CNMV market
regulator banned the creation of negative bets using all equity
securities through shares, derivatives and over-the-counter
instruments for three months while Italy’s Consob prohibited the
practice on 29 banking and insurance shares for one week.  “Short-selling bans on banking and insurance stocks are a
sure sign that all is not well, though I fear that these
restrictions will only offer the most temporary of respites,”
said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG Index in London.  Barclays (BARC)  tumbled 4.2 percent to 152.55 pence, while RBS
dropped 3.3 percent to 197.9 pence and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
 Europe’s largest lender , declined 3.5 percent to 514.6 pence.  Among insurers,  Aviva Plc (AV/)  slumped 6.6 percent to 275.2
pence,  Prudential Plc (PRU)  slid 3.6 percent to 732.5 pence and  Legal
& General Group Plc (LGEN)  slipped 2.6 percent to 125.3 pence.  Mining companies also retreated with commodity prices after
Song Guoqing, a member of the monetary-policy committee of the
People’s Bank of China, said the world’s second-largest economy
may slow for a seventh quarter to 7.4 percent in the three
months to September.  Xstrata, Antofagasta  Xstrata dropped 3.3 percent to 812.8 pence and  Antofagasta
Plc (ANTO)  declined 3.5 percent to 1,027 pence.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
 world’s largest mining company , slid 2.8 percent to 1,765 pence.  Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. declined 4 percent to 366
pence following a report in the Sunday Times that ENRC is close
to an agreement to buy out Dan Gertler, the owner of a 49.5
percent stake in a copper mine in  Democratic Republic  of Congo.
The newspaper did not say where it got the information.  African Barrick Gold Plc (ABG)  slumped 16 percent to 317 pence
after the largest producer of the metal in Tanzania reported a
57 percent drop in  second-quarter profit  to $29.9 million as
gold output declined and the company’s costs rose. Attributable
gold output fell 11 percent to 153,099 ounces.  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the London-based explorer with the most
licenses in Africa, slid 4 percent to 1,373 pence after rival
Marathon Oil Corp. paid $35 million to Africa Oil Corp. for
interests in two Kenyan exploration projects.  Africa Oil said that the two companies have also “agreed
to jointly pursue exploration activities on an additional
exploration area in Ethiopia.”  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN)  lost 2.6 percent to 244.8
pence. The company today reported a 1.1 percent decline in
assets under management for the quarter to 182.7 billion pounds
($283 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
