The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 8 basis points to 170 basis points
as of 8:42 a.m. in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The gauge is on track for its biggest daily
increase since June 1 and its highest close in two weeks,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 6 basis points
to 181 as of 10:31 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The benchmark is poised to close at its highest
level since July 9, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-
Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index gained 4.5 basis points to
183.5 basis points as of 9:51 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc.
prices show. The index is set to close at its highest level
since June 28, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
