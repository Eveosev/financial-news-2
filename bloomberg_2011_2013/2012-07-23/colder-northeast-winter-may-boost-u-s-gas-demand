The coming winter in the U.S.
Northeast may be colder and snowier than last year, driving up
demand for fuel to heat homes and businesses, according to
AccuWeather Inc.  A weak El Nino, or warming in the equatorial  Pacific Ocean ,
will probably have developed by December, and that often means
lower temperatures and more snow from  Massachusetts  to  Georgia ,
said Jack Boston, expert senior meteorologist.  “I would say that energy usage in the Northeast is
probably going to be up compared to last winter; I would be
pretty confident of that,” Boston said from AccuWeather’s
headquarters in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Winter 2011-2012 was the fourth-warmest on record in the 48
contiguous U.S. states and contributed to a 26 percent decline
in natural gas prices through the season. Meteorologists mark
winter from Dec. 1 through February.  A weak El Nino may also mean the northern Great Plains and
Midwest get less snow and warmer-than-normal weather, while the
southern U.S. may be cooler and wetter than usual, he said.  “I think it is pretty safe to say that this winter is not
going to be like last winter,” Boston said.  Boston said AccuWeather may make some modifications to its
outlook before the season starts.  Last year, many meteorologists, including AccuWeather,
predicted a cooler-than-normal winter, while the opposite
occurred. Blocking patterns that usually set up in the Atlantic
and keep cold air bottled up across the eastern U.S. never
developed.  “Everybody’s forecast was lousy,” Boston said. “It
doesn’t make it any easier to take.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
