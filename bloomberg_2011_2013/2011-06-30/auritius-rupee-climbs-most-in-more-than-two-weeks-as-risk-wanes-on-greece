Mauritius’s rupee strengthened the
most in three months against the dollar as  Greece ’s approval of
budget cuts curbed concern the nation’s debt crisis may spread,
raising demand for higher-yielding, frontier-market assets.  The Indian Ocean island country’s currency appreciated 2.8
percent to 28 per dollar by 4:27 p.m. in  Port Louis , the
capital, the strongest increase since March 21. The rupee has
advanced 1.3 percent this quarter, a second of gains. The
currency was the second-best performer worldwide against the
dollar after Uganda’s shilling, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The euro rose to a three-week high versus the dollar,
frontier-market stocks snapped five days of declines and
Mauritius’s share gauge climbed for a second day after Greek
lawmakers adopted a 78 billion-euro package of budget cuts and
state asset sales, postponing a default. The vote paved the way
for payment of the next installment of international aid, said
Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads a group of euro-area
finance ministers.  “Investors are shifting away from the dollar because of
better risk premiums in Europe at the moment”, Nitish
Benimadhu, a  fund manager  at the Port Louis-based Anglo
Mauritius Financial Services Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
