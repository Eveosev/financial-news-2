Deere & Co. (DE) , the world’s largest
maker of  farm equipment , said sales of tractors and machinery to
farmers in Brazil are rising, buoyed by high commodities prices.  Demand from small farms is climbing even as a strong local
currency and high interest rates erode profit from exports of
soybeans, corn and other commodities, Chief Executive Officer
Samuel R. Allen said today in an interview in Brasilia. Brazil
and Russia are the two emerging markets with the biggest
opportunities for growth, Allen said.  “They have the potential to be the breadbaskets of the
world,” he said, adding that the Moline, Illinois-based company
is “very focused on small farms.”  Corn futures in  New York  have surged 66 percent in the past
year, while soybeans are up 44 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
