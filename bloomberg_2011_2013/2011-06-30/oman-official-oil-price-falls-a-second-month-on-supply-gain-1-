Oman crude’s official selling price
fell for a second month in August as Saudi Arabia offered
refiners extra oil supplies and the  International Energy Agency 
agreed to release stockpiles.  The August official selling price for Oman oil will be
$107.84 a barrel, based on the average of daily futures
settlement prices on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange calculated by
Bloomberg News. That’s 1.2 percent below July’s level of
$109.20. Today’s settlement at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time was
$105.99.  Open interest in the August Oman futures was 8,355
contracts as of 4:49 p.m. Singapore time, the equivalent of
about 8.4 million barrels of crude, or about 16 cargoes of
500,000 barrels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the lowest since August 2009, and compares with open interest of
11,210 a month earlier.  Prices declined after refiners were inundated with  Saudi
Arabia ’s extra supply for July loading that processors from
 India ,  China  and  Japan  purchased. Those barrels were followed by
the release of crude and fuel from stockpiles in Japan and  South
Korea  as part of an initiative by the International Energy
Agency to release 60 million barrels of light, low-sulfur crude.  Refiners in Asia are also facing slumping refinery margins
amid a decline in demand. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a
measure of profitability, dropped 8.6 percent to $17.79 a barrel
today from the start of the month, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  Oman futures for September delivery fell $1.45 to $106.15 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 4:30 p.m. Singapore
time, with 21 contracts traded.  Oman crude for immediate loading surged 82 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $106.55 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in August jumped 1 percent to $106.33. Murban
increased 0.9 percent to $110.90.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 3
cents to $5.07 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for September rose 5
cents to $4.78.  To contact the reporter on this story:
