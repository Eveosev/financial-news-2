Asian stocks rose, with the regional
benchmark index headed for its highest close in a month, as
concern about a banking crisis eased after Greece passed
austerity measures and German financial institutions pushed
toward an agreement to roll over Greek debt holdings.  HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s biggest bank by market value,
gained 1.5 percent in  Hong Kong  on speculation Greece will
secure financial aid and avoid a default that might destabilize
the region’s banking system.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which gets 21 percent
of its sales in Europe, climbed 3 percent in  Tokyo .  BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company and Australia’s No. 1
oil producer, increased 1.5 percent after crude and metals
futures climbed.  “There will still be a lot of twists and turns, but Greece
has been able to avoid a worst-case scenario,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. “That makes it easier for investors
to take on risk.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.4 percent to 135.18,
as of 7:55 p.m. in Tokyo, set for its highest close since June 1
and paring a quarterly decline to 0.4 percent. Almost four
stocks rose for each that dropped. Through yesterday the gauge
tumbled 5.4 percent from this year’s high on May 2, amid concern
a slowing U.S. economy, Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and
 China ’s steps to curb inflation will crimp earnings.  Kospi, Nikkei  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index increased 1.7 percent. Hong
Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 1.5 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.2 percent. South Korea’s Kospi
Index added 0.3 percent.  Japan ’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained
0.2 percent, after swinging between gains and losses at least
six times.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The index rose 0.8 percent yesterday as Greece’s
parliament passed budget cuts and tax increases that satisfy
European conditions for more bailout money. U.S. Banks including
Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. advanced after the
 Federal Reserve  raised a ceiling on debit-card transaction fees.  Financial shares rallied after Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou yesterday secured a vote in favor of an austerity
plan that clears the way for the next payment due from last
year’s bailout. He faces a final vote today to stave off default
for his debt-laden nation. German financial companies will
present a draft proposal to roll over Greek debt holdings to
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  at a meeting today,
according to people familiar with the plan.  Solvency Issue  “The passage of the Greek vote on austerity does clear off
doubts regarding the liquidity situation for the time being,”
said  Binay Chandgothia , Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at
Principal Global Investors, which has assets of more than $200
billion. “The key issue of solvency remains and is likely to
come back.”  HSBC gained 1.5 percent to HK$77.05 in Hong Kong.  Standard
Chartered Plc. (2888) , the U.K.’s third-largest bank by market value,
climbed 1.3 percent to HK$200.80.  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia (CBA) , the nation’s biggest lender, increased 1.8 percent to
A$52.30.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s largest
publicly traded bank, rose 2.1 percent to 390 yen in Tokyo.
Smaller  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  gained 1.3 percent
to 2,468 yen. Japan’s major banks were raised to “overweight”
from “market weight” by Deutsche Bank AG, which said first-
quarter earnings may show “good progress” and concern is
receding that lenders will need to raise capital.  Exporters Advance  Exporters to Europe extended gains. Sony Corp. advanced 3
percent to 2,117 yen in Tokyo.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese
carmaker that gets 18 percent of sales from Europe, gained 1.9
percent to 211 yen. Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., an operator of
ports, mobile-phone services and retail stores that gets most of
its revenue from Europe, rose 1.9 percent to HK$84 in Hong Kong.  All 10 industry groups on the Asian benchmark index
advanced, led by utilities, financial institutions, raw material
producers and energy companies.  BHP added 1.5 percent to A$43.80 in Sydney. Jiangxi Copper
Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal, climbed 4 percent to
HK$25.85 in Hong Kong.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , the nation’s largest offshore
oil explorer, increased 1.8 percent to HK$18.16.  Crude oil for August delivery gained 2 percent to settle at

500 , a 2.6 percent increase for the MSCI All-Country World Index
and a drop of 2.2 percent by the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.7 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times for the S&P 500,
12.4 times for the global gauge and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  BYD Co., the Chinese automaker partly-owned by Warren
