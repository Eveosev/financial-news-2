South African Reserve Bank Governor
Gill Marcus said the country’s economic recovery remains fragile
and the debt crisis in  Greece  and other European countries
complicates the outlook for monetary policy.  “In times of such great uncertainty it’s important for a
central bank to remain focused on its primary responsibility,
but vigilant and aware of what’s happening in the global and
domestic economic environment,” Marcus said in a speech at the
central bank’s ordinary general meeting in  Pretoria  today.  Marcus has left  South Africa ’s benchmark interest rate
unchanged at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent, even as she forecast
inflation may breach the 3 percent to 6 percent target next
year, to help support the recovery. She said economic data are
giving mixed signals about what interest rate is needed.  Rising food and fuel prices helped boost inflation to 4.6
percent in May from 4.2 percent. At the same time, growth in
manufacturing, which makes up 15 percent of the economy, slowed
to an annual 0.4 percent in April from 4.9 percent the previous
month.  While “there are signs that the recovery is becoming more
self-sustained,” the manufacturing figures and a slowdown in
building and investment also highlight its fragility, Marcus
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
