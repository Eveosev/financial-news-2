A U.S. sale of 30.2 million barrels
of oil from strategic reserves to help stabilize prices was
“substantially oversubscribed,” the Energy Department said.  The U.S. offered light, sweet crude as part of a
coordinated  International Energy Agency  release after shortages
caused by political conflict in  Libya  and the failure of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this month to
agree on production increases.  “Over 90 offers to purchase oil were received yesterday,”
the Washington-based department said today in an e-mailed
statement. Contracts will be completed by July 11, the agency
said.  The U.S. release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
accounts for half of the global total offered by the Paris-based
International Energy Agency, which announced the action June 23.  Among nations,  Germany  will open up 4.2 million barrels of
its reserves and the U.K.’s share will be 3 million, the IEA
said. Agency members collectively hold 1.6 billion barrels of
emergency inventories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
