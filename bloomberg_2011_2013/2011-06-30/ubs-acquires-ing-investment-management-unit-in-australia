UBS AG (UBSN)  agreed to buy  ING Groep NV (INGA) ’s
Australian investment management unit, adding 24.8 billion euros
($36 billion) of assets, as the Dutch bank shrinks its balance
sheet after a government bailout.  ING and UBS expect to complete the deal in the fourth
quarter, the banks said in separate statements today. Neither
company disclosed the terms of the transaction.  The purchase will make UBS one of  Australia ’s top 10
investment managers by asset size, the Zurich-based company
said. ING, the biggest Dutch financial-services company, is
selling assets as a condition of a government bailout.  “The acquisition significantly increases the scale and
distribution of our business,” Ben Heap, head of UBS Global
Asset Management for Australia and  New Zealand , said in the
statement.  Most of the ING unit’s assets are managed on behalf of
OnePath, the wealth-management business of  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  ANZ Bank agreed in September 2009 to
buy ING’s stake in their life insurance and wealth-management
venture for A$1.76 billion ($1.9 billion).  Under today’s accord, UBS said it will provide investment
advisory services to ANZ Bank.  ING was advised on the UBS agreement by Pottinger, an
Australian financial adviser. UBS used its own investment
bankers.  ING this month agreed to sell its U.S. online bank to
Capital One Financial Corp. for $9 billion and said last week
it’s in talks with potential buyers of its car leasing and
fleet-management business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
