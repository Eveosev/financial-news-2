Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT) , owner of South
Africa’s biggest money changer, offered to buy  Mercantile Bank
Holdings Ltd. (MTL)  to expand in consumer and retail banking.  The 35.5 cents-a-share offer is 69 percent more than
Mercantile’s weighted average share price over the past 30 days,
the Johannesburg-based target said in a statement to the stock
exchange today. The offer values Mercantile at about 1.4 billion
rand ($207 million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Caixa Geral de Depositos owns 92 percent of Mercantile. A
spokesman at the Lisbon-based lender couldn’t immediately
comment on the offer.  Mercantile rose 5 cents, or 25 percent, to 25 cents at the
5 p.m. close in Johannesburg trading. Bidvest shares dropped 95
cents, or 0.6 percent, to 150.50 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
