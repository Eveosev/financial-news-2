HMV Group Plc (HMV)  said it will scale
back on stocking CDs and DVDs in favor of consumer electronics,
and will expand its live event operations as it regroups after
selling Waterstone’s book chain and its Canadian outlets.  The retailer, which reported a “disappointing and
unsatisfactory” year, said today it hopes to have 150 stores
reconfigured by Christmas to add more technology products. HMV
recorded a 123.1 million-pound ($198.1 million) full-year loss
after taking impairment charges on the Waterstone’s and Canada
sales, the Maidenhead, England-based company said in a statement
on Regulatory News Service.  Products such as MP3 players and headphones now represent 8
percent of HMV U.K. sales, and the company said it’s also trying
to expand revenue by promoting events in stores. Waterstone’s
book chain has been sold and agreement reached on selling its
121 Canadian stores as part of a 220 million-pound  refinancing
program.  “We believe that there is a clear place for HMV as a
specialist retailer of entertainment products and that by
rebalancing the space in many of our stores away from declining
categories to a focused range of high-growth technology products
we will both enhance our offering to our customers and
strengthen our sales base,” Chairman Philip Rowley said in the
statement.  HMV gained 2.5 percent to 10.25 pence at 8.35 a.m. in
 London . The shares have fallen 70 percent so far this year,
giving the company a market value of 41.3 million pounds.  Net loss was 123.1 million pounds, or a loss of 29.1 pence
per share in the 53 weeks ended April 30, from a profit of 49.2
million pounds, or 11.3 pence per share in the 52 weeks ended
April 24, 2010, HMV said in the statement. Results included a
118.5 million-pound charge for on the Waterstone’s and  Canadian
transactions.  Sales at outlets open at least a year declined 11 percent,
with same-store revenue for continuing operations dropping
almost 15 percent, the company said.  HMV scrapped its final dividend, to make the year’s total
0.9 pence, down from 7.4 pence a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
