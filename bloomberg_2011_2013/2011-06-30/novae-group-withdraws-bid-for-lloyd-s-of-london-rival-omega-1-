Novae Group Plc (NVA) , a Lloyd’s of London
insurer, said it has withdrawn from merger talks with smaller
rival  Omega Insurance Holdings Ltd. (OIH)  without giving a reason for
the decision.  “It is unlikely a transaction can be structured at this
stage which is demonstrably in Novae’s shareholders’
interests,” the London-based insurer said today in a statement.
An Omega spokeswoman, Juliet Tilley, declined to comment.  Novae had been bidding with fellow Lloyd’s insurer Barbican
Group Holdings Ltd. for Omega, the smallest publicly traded firm
in the London market. Stagnant premium rates caused by excess
capital has prompted a flurry of acquisition and merger attempts
in the past year with  Brit Insurance Holdings NV (BRE)  being sold to
private-equity firms and Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Ltd.
rejecting an approach from Beazley Plc.  Novae rose 0.4 percent to 353.5 pence a share at 3:46 p.m.
in London trading. Omega was up 2.6 percent to 80 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
