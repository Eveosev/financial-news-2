The  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority is
asking local banks to set more capital aside to protect against
non-performing loans to cope with “rapid loan growth” in the
city and safeguard against market downturns, the regulator said
today.  The HKMA has talked to lenders about increasing reserve
requirements at all banks in Hong Kong this year to strengthen
their stability, Apple Daily reported today, citing the  HKMA ’s
Deputy Chief Executive Arthur Yuen.  “Half of the banks in Hong Kong have agreed with the
implementation timetable, and the level of the regulatory
requirement,” the HKMA said in an e-mailed response to
questions about the increase.  The reserve requirement will depend on each bank’s
individual loan total, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
