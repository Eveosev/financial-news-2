Trading of put options on  Dendreon
Corp. (DNDN) , the drugmaker whose only product is Provenge, rose to a
seven-month high before Medicare approved paying for the
prostate cancer treatment.  Almost 19,000 contracts giving the right to sell the stock
changed hands as of 4 p.m. in  New York , 10 times the four-week
average, as the shares slumped 2.6 percent to $39.44. They
gained 1.8 percent to $40.14 as of 4:14 p.m. in late trading
after the approval announcement. The most-active contracts were
July $38 puts, which accounted for almost a third of put trades.
The shares haven’t closed below $38 since May 17.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a final
ruling today saying the $93,000 treatment is “reasonable and
necessary” for men with advanced, prostate tumors resistant to
hormone therapy who have minimal or no symptoms. The decision is
in line with prescribing information for the drug approved in
April 2010. Dendreon, based in  Seattle , may generate sales of
$2.1 billion in 2014, according to the average estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Any kind of uncertainty like that will drive up interest
in options,” said Caitlin Duffy, an options analyst at
Greenwich, Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers Group Inc.
“There’s a lot of fresh positioning and a lot of buying
indicating some need for protection or outright bearish outlook
in the short term.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
