Verizon Wireless, the largest U.S.
wireless provider, will probably say sales of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone dropped when it reports second-quarter results, a  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  analyst said.  “IPhone sales will likely be a touch below the 2.2
million” Verizon sold in the first quarter, said Jason Armstrong in a research note. Verizon began sales of the
smartphone Feb. 3, more than a month into the first quarter.  Armstrong said he met yesterday with investor relations
executives from Verizon Communications Inc., which co-owns
Verizon Wireless with  Vodafone Group Plc. (VOD)  Brenda Raney, a
spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New-Jersey based Verizon
Wireless, declined to comment.  AT&T Inc. (T) , based in Dallas, had held an almost four-year
exclusivity on the Apple handset in the U.S. The iPhone is
Apple’s best-selling device, accounting for half of revenue in
the Cupertino, California-based company’s fiscal second quarter.  Sales of Verizon’s other smartphones, which include the  HTC
Corp. ThunderBolt  that works on Verizon’s faster fourth-
generation network, were above the carrier’s expectations,
Armstrong said.  Verizon, like AT&T, sells the iPhone 4 for $199.99 or
$299.99 with a two-year contract. AT&T also offers an older
variety, the 3GS, for $49 with a contract.  Verizon Communications, based in New York, rose 51 cents to
$37.23 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
and has gained 4.1 percent this year. Apple rose $1.63 to
$335.67 on the Nasdaq Stock Market and is up 4.1 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
