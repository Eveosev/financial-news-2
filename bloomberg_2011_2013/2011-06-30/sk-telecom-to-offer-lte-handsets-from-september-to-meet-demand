SK Telecom Co.,  South Korea ’s
largest mobile-phone carrier, will offer handsets using its
fourth-generation network from September to meet surging demand
for video and games on smartphones.  The handset will be the first to use SK Telecom’s fourth-
generation technology, which has greater capacity for video and
other data-intensive functions, the Seoul-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The service is based on long-term evolution technology, or
LTE. The carrier also plans to offer four more LTE handsets this
year and two LTE tablet computers from October. Other South
Korean carriers offer fourth-generation services based on
different technology.  SK Telecom is set to start commercial LTE service in Seoul
tomorrow and to expand coverage nationwide by 2013. The carrier
expects the number of its LTE subscribers to jump to 10 million
by 2015 from 300,000 this year, according to the statement.  The company said on May 3 that it will boost  capital
spending  to 2.3 trillion won ($2.1 billion) this year, 300
billion won more than a previous plan. The extra amount will be
all used to expand the capacity of the existing networks and
prepare to start LTE services, SK said at that time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
