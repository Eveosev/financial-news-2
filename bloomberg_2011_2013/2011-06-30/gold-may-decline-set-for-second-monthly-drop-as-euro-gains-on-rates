Gold may advance for a third day,
heading for an 11th quarterly increase, as concerns about
European debt crisis subsided after  Greece  passed austerity
measures needed to avoid the euro area’s first default.  Immediate-delivery gold was little changed at $1,511.05 an
ounce by 2:06 p.m. in Singapore. The price is up about 5.6
percent in the second quarter, reaching a record $1,577.57 on
May 2. The August-delivery contract climbed 0.2 percent to
$1,513.60 an ounce in  New York . Cash palladium jumped to its
highest in a week.  “Risk sentiment improved after the Greek parliament
approved the austerity measures,” Stefan Graber, an analyst
with Credit Suisse Group AG, said in a report today. “This
helped the euro to strengthen against the dollar, which in turn
attracted fresh investor interest into precious metals.”  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou yesterday garnered
enough votes for his 78 billion euro ($113 billion) package of
budget cuts and state asset sales. Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads a group of euro-area finance ministers, said
the Greek parliament’s vote paves the way for payment of the
next aid installment from euro-area governments and the
 International Monetary Fund .  The dollar declined for a fourth straight day against a
basket of six major currencies. Precious metals normally move
inversely to the greenback. The euro was 0.5 percent stronger
against the dollar at $1.45.  Protection of Wealth  Gold is up 6.5 percent in 2011 after climbing the past 10
years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades, as
investors sought protection of wealth amid Europe’s debt crisis.  Spot gold lost as much as 0.2 percent earlier amid
speculation that the  European Central Bank  will raise  interest
rates  next week. The metal is still down about 1.5 percent this
month after declining 1.8 percent in May.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said June 28 that policy
makers are in “strong vigilance mode,” supporting expectations
for an interest-rate increase at the bank’s meeting on July 7.
The ECB raised its benchmark rate in April for the first time in
almost three years.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed 0.5 percent to
$35.055 an ounce. The price has dropped about 7 percent the past
three months, set for the first quarterly loss in 10.  Cash palladium jumped as much as 1.5 percent to $762 an
ounce, the highest since June 23. Spot platinum was 0.2 percent
higher at $1,725.50 an ounce. Still, both metals are heading for
second quarterly declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
