U.S. stocks extended gains, sending
the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index to its biggest four-day rise
since December, after measures of  consumer confidence  and
Chicago-area purchasing were better than expected.   The  S&P 500  advanced 0.7 percent to 1,316.72 at 9:49 a.m.
in New York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 94.79
points, or 0.8 percent, to 12,356.21 today.  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer unexpectedly rose to 61.1 in June from
56.6 a month earlier. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.
Economists projected the gauge would drop to 54, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Consumer confidence rose to the highest level in 10 weeks,
as falling gasoline prices provided relief to Americans
contending with 9.1 percent joblessness.  The Bloomberg Consumer
Comfort Index increased to minus 43.9 for the period ended June
26 after dropping to minus 44.9 the prior week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
