James Swanson, chief investment
strategist at  MFS Investment Management , said the global
economic recovery is healthier than recoveries in the 1980s and
1990s because it’s not being driven by credit.  Companies have been “stockpiling cash,” and are in a
better position to grow than in previous economic crises, said
Swanson, speaking at an event in Santiago,  Chile , organized by
MFS. The greatest threat to the recovery, he said, is the rising
price of oil and inflation.  “Corporate profits have now recaptured their previous
peak,” Swanson said. “They’re a very strong fuel to keep the
business cycle going.”  U.S. growth will accelerate in the second half of 2011 as
companies increase spending and unemployment declines, Swanson
said. He prefers stocks to bonds, adding that U.S. technology
and health-care equities represent an “opportunity.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
