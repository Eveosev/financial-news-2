South Africa ’s bondholders are
paring bets on stronger price increases before a sale of
inflation-linked debt after credit growth slowed and producer
prices climbed less than economists expected in May.  The Pretoria-based central bank will auction 600 million
rand ($88.2 million) of inflation-linked debt maturing in 2022,
2028 and 2033 at its weekly sale tomorrow, according to Reserve
Bank data on Bloomberg. The auction is at 11 a.m. in  Pretoria ,
with results announced 30 minutes later, the bank said.  The yield difference, or breakeven rate, between 10-year
linkers and similar-maturity fixed-rate bonds dropped three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.83 percent today.
The rate, which reflects investors’ outlook for inflation, has
declined from 6.22 percent on March 10. Credit growth in
 Africa ’s biggest economy slowed to 5.18 percent in May, from
6.18 percent in April, the statistics agency reported today,
less than economists’ median estimate of of 6.3 percent.  “We still believe that there is not sufficient evidence
that stronger growth is resulting in demand-side pressures on
inflation,”  Carmen Altenkirch  and Dennis Dykes, analysts at
Nedbank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, wrote in a research note.
“With consumer demand relatively subdued and only modest credit
growth, the risk of second-round inflation building any momentum
seems modest.”  Producer-price inflation accelerated 6.9 percent, from 6.6
percent in April, the agency said in a separate report. That was
less than the 7.1 percent median estimate by economists.  Yields rose at the previous auction of inflation-linked
bonds on June 24 as investors bid for 1.4 times the amount of
debt allocated. Inflation-linked bonds have returned 3.03
percent this quarter, less than the 3.79 percent return of
fixed-rate bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
