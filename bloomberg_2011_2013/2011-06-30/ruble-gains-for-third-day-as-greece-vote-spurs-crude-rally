The ruble climbed for a third day,
poised for the strongest closing level in more than two weeks as
 Greece ’s vote to impose new austerity measures spurred a rally
in oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner.  Russia’s currency gained 0.3 percent to 27.8849 per dollar
as of 10:29 a.m. in Moscow, extending its advance this quarter
to 1.9 percent. The ruble was little changed against the euro at
40.40, leaving it steady at 33.5167 versus the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket.  Oil rose for a third day after the Greek parliament passed
Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s 78 billion-euro ($112
billion) austerity plan, boosting confidence the country’s debt
crisis won’t derail an economic recovery. Crude for August
delivery jumped as much as 67 cents a barrel, and last traded up
0.2 percent at $94.95 a barrel.  Russian  government bonds  were little changed, leaving the
yield on dollar debt due in 2015 steady at 2.919 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield on the
country’s ruble Eurobond was little changed at 6.979 percent.  Non-deliverable forwards, which allow companies to hedge
against currency movements, show the ruble at 28.1571 per dollar
in three months, compared with 28.2082 yesterday.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
