Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  has
deferred more than 1 million metric tons of naphtha imports
because of the shutdown of one of its crackers, ICIS reported,
citing an unidentified company official.  The company deferred a cargo of at least 600,000 tons of
naphtha for delivery between July and August, according to the
report. The cargo was originally scheduled to be delivered
between the end of May and June, ICIS said.  The company is running its No. 2 cracker in Mailiao,
 Taiwan , at 80 percent of capacity, according to the ICIS report.  Formosa plans to close its No. 3 naphtha cracker at Mailiao
for maintenance in August and hasnâ€™t fixed a schedule for the
resumption of its No. 1 unit at the site, Lin Keh-yen, a Taipei-
based company spokesman, said on June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
