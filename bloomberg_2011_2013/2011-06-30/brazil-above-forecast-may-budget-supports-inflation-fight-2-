Brazil ’s budget surplus before
interest payments exceeded expectations in May, providing
additional support for the central bank in its efforts to cool
the fastest inflation since 2005.  The primary surplus, which includes federal and local
governments as well as state companies, widened to 7.5 billion
reais ($4.8 billion) in May, from 487 million reais in May 2010,
the central bank said in a statement distributed today in
Brasilia. The surplus was higher than the 7.1 billion reais
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts.  The government’s budget numbers have been boosted by rising
tax revenues from strong domestic demand, high commodities
prices and increased revenue from import tariffs, said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast
Inc., who correctly forecast the 7.5 billion surplus.  “Revenues are strong. I don’t see any difficulty in them
meeting the target,” Tuesta said in a telephone interview. The
government has also been successful in restraining spending
growth, Tuesta added.  The accumulated surplus in the first five months of the
year was 64.8 billion reais, equivalent to 55 percent of the
government’s 2011 target of 117.9 billion reais.  Government Target  Policy makers’ inflation outlook for 2012 assumes that
President Dilma Rousseff’s government will hit this target,
Carlos Hamilton, the central bank’s director for economic
policy, said yesterday.  The government’s current fiscal policy is
“contractionary,” Hamilton told reporters in Brasilia
yesterday.  Consumer prices rose 6.55 percent in the year through mid-
June. Inflation has exceeded the upper limit of the central
bank’s target range since April. The bank targets inflation of
4.5 percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  The budget result, “reinforces the view the National
Treasury may lend a hand to the Brazilian Central Bank on
curbing domestic demand throughout 2011,” said Flavio Serrano,
senior economist at Espirito Santo Investment Bank in Sao Paulo
in a note to investors.  The  budget deficit  widened to 14.7 billion reais, from 1.6
billion reais in April, the central bank said.  Debt  Net debt in May was 39.8 percent of gross domestic product,
unchanged from April. The central bank expects the number to
fall to 39.7 percent in June, said Tulio Maciel, head of the
central bank’s economic research department.  The central bank raised its 2011 forecast for net debt as a
percentage of GDP to 39 percent, from 38 percent, Maciel told
reporters in Brasilia.  The bank also revised its forecast for its 2011 budget
deficit to 2.5 percent, from 1.9 percent, as faster inflation
and higher borrowing costs increase its interest payments.  The yield on the interest rate futures contract maturing
in January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 12.66 percent at
12:30 p.m. New York time.  Rates, Prices, Spending  Traders are wagering that the central bank will raise
borrowing costs by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to
12.5 percent at its July policy meeting, and are split on
whether it will then increase rates for a sixth straight meeting
in August, interest-rate futures contracts show.  Economists expect consumer prices to rise 6.16 percent this
year and 5.18 percent in 2012, according to the central bank’s
weekly survey of economists published May 30.  The government today delayed by three months a plan to
shelve some public works that were approved in the 2009 budget,
Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told reporters today.  In April, the government announced they could shelve as
much as 10 billion reais in spending by cancelling some
investment plans that were approved in budgets from 2007 to 2009
that hadn’t started yet.  Mantega said the move to postpone the cancelation of some
spending won’t impact the government’s plan to cut 50 billion
reais from this year’s budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
