California Governor  Jerry Brown 
signed an $85.9 billion spending plan that relies on economic
improvement rather than tax extensions, meeting the state budget
deadline for only the second time in a decade.  Brown’s signature means the most-populous state will be
able to borrow from  Wall Street  to fund its operations. It also
means lawmakers will be paid again after having their salaries
docked two weeks for missing their constitutional deadline.  The budget closes 70 state parks, postpones the opening of
two veterans’ homes, strips $1.3 billion from California’s two
university systems, delays $3 billion in payments to schools and
takes $1.7 billion from local redevelopment agencies, although
it doesn’t dissolve them, as Brown had proposed.  “This is an honest but painful budget that returns
 California ’s general-fund spending to levels unseen since the
1970s,” Brown said in a statement sent by e-mail. “We’ve cut
our deficit by $15 billion and achieved financial balance this
year. This is a huge step forward. But California’s long-term
stability depends on our willingness to continue to pay down
debt and live within our means.”  Democrats who control the state Assembly and Senate
approved the budget June 28 after Brown dropped his plan to
raise about $11 billion by extending increases in taxes and fees
that expire today.  The revised budget instead counts on revenue beating
forecasts by $4 billion as well as additional budget cuts and
deferred payments if the money fails to materialize.  Brown’s signature gives the state its first on-time budget
since 2006, according to  data  from the state Department of
Finance. California’s general-fund expenditures in 2011-12 will
be the  lowest  since 2004-05, state finance data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
