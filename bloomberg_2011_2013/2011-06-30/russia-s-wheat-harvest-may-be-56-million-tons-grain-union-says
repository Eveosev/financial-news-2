Russian farmers may harvest as much
as 56 million metric tons of wheat this year, the country’s
 Grain Union  President Arkady Zlochevsky said, a third more than
in 2010.  The new grains harvest may reach as much as 90 million tons
if favorable weather continues into July, he told journalists
today in Moscow. The harvest was 60.9 million tons last year
after drought damaged crops, according to the Federal State
Statistics Service. The harvest will include between 52 million
and 56 million tons of wheat, Zlochevsky said. The wheat harvest
was 41.4 million tons last year, the statistics service said.  Russia will produce more feed grain in the new season
because it sowed seeds of “not very good” quality this year,
Zlochevsky said. Milling wheat has traditionally comprised
between 67 percent and 68 percent of the harvest, and the share
will drop to about 62 percent this year, he added.  Russia has the potential to export between 20 million and
25 million tons of grains. Still, between 15 million and 16
million tons may be exported as demand weakened after the
country banned shipments last year following the drought,
Zlochevsky said. The restrictions end tomorrow.  The barley harvest is estimated at between 15.5 million and
16 million tons, and the sunflower seeds harvest is expected to
reach between 7.5 million and 8 million tons. Corn is seen at
between 5 million and 6 million tons, he said.  Russia’s grain reserves are estimated at 21 million tons
before the new marketing season that starts tomorrow, the Grain
Union president said. Stockpiles exceeded 26 million tons a year
earlier, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
