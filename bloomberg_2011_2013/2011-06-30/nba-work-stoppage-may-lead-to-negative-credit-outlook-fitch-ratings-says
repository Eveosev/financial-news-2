Fitch Ratings  said it may place a
negative outlook on the  National Basketball Association ’s debt
if a prolonged work stoppage leads to the cancellation of games.  Fitch maintains a BBB+ rating with a stable outlook on the
NBA’s $957 million league-wide credit facility and $1.34 billion
in senior notes. The company also maintains investment-grade
ratings on about $1 billion in debt related to arenas where a
basketball team is the primary tenant. A stoppage in excess of a
year may result in further action.  Management and the players’ union are meeting today in a
last-ditch effort to agree on a contract replacing the one that
expires tonight. The union has said it expects owners to impose
a lockout if an agreement isn’t reached.  “While Fitch believes lenders to the NBA and NBA arenas
are protected in the short term, longer-term impacts from work-
stoppages in professional sports have always been highlighted as
a credit risk as they have the potential to alienate the fan
base,” the New York-based rating company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
