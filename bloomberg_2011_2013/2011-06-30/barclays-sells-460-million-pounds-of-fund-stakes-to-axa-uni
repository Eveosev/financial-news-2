Barclays Plc (BARC) , the British bank run
by  Robert Diamond , agreed to sell 460 million pounds ($739
million) of stakes in private-equity funds as regulators make it
costlier for lenders to own the assets.  A unit of French insurer  AXA SA (CS)  agreed to buy the stakes in
funds and direct holdings in companies for more than book value,
the London-based lender said in a statement today. Barclays will
book a “small” profit from the sale, it said, without giving
further details about the price.  Barclays follows  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc and Credit Agricole SA in seeking to sell holdings in
leveraged buyout funds as lenders are forced by regulators to
hold more capital in reserve against their riskiest assets. The
lender sold Barclays Private Equity, its private-equity unit, to
its managers last year.  The acquisition is the second by Axa’s private-equity unit
this month, following its purchase of $1.7 billion of fund
stakes from New York-based Citigroup.  Axa Private Equity is among firms raising funds to take
advantage of banks selling private-equity stakes. It had
received $2.5 billion in commitments for the pool by the end of
May, a person with knowledge of the matter said at the time. The
Paris-based company is seeking to amass more than $3 billion by
the end of July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
