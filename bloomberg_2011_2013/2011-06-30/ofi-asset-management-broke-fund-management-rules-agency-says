OFI Asset Management , a Paris-based
fund management company, was accused by  France ’s financial
regulator of violating market rules by using one of its funds to
prop up another.  OFI should be fined 600,000 euros ($871,000), a
representative of the Autorite des Marches Financiers said at an
enforcement hearing today in Paris.  OFI sent an alert to clients in one of its short-term
investment funds in May 2008 saying the fund’s investments were
doing badly. Less than 10 days later, the firm invested assets
from another longer-term fund in the underperforming one, the
AMF said. That sacrificed investors in the second fund to save
the others, and meant clients weren’t equally informed.  “The only alternative was to close the fund,” OFI
managing director Gerard Bourret said. “It was in the
investors’ interest not to sow doubt in the company” as that
would have threatened all OFI’s funds.  OFI, which later liquidated the short-term fund, had
believed when investing the one fund in the other that the
financial crisis was ending and the failing fund would rebound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
