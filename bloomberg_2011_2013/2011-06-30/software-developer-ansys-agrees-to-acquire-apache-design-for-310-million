Ansys Inc. (ANSS) , the Canonsburg,
Pennsylvania-based software developer, agreed to buy closely
held Apache Design Solutions Inc., a simulation-software
provider, for about $310 million in cash.  The deal includes an estimated $29 million in cash on
Apache’s balance sheet and will be “modestly accretive” to
Ansys earnings, excluding one-time costs, in its first full year
of combined operations, the companies said in a statement.  Apache, whose software allows engineers to design power-
efficient devices, had filed for an initial public offering and
a Nasdaq Stock Market listing on March 14. The sale to Ansys is
anticipated to close in the third quarter, according to the
statement. Ansys said it’s unable to provide GAAP estimates due
to acquisition-related costs until the transaction closes.  Ansys rose 17 cents to $55.15 at 9:55 a.m.  New York  time in
Nasdaq trading. Shares have increased 5.6 percent this year
before today.  Deutsche Bank Securities is acting as  San Jose , California-
based Apache’s exclusive financial adviser. Ansys is being
advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
