The euro may climb to almost a two-
month high against the yen next week after rising above key
technical levels, Ueda Harlow Ltd. said, citing trading
patterns.  The 17-nation currency broke above its 21-day moving
average and the so-called cloud this week in a daily ichimoku
chart, said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior currency analyst in  Tokyo 
at Ueda Harlow, which provides foreign-exchange margin-trading
services.  The chart also shows the first and second leading span
lines are set to converge, compressing the cloud at around the
116.60 yen level on around July 4. Should the euro enter the
cloud and stay inside after the cloud flips to above the first
span line, the next target will be 118.38 yen, according to
Yamauchi.  “There’s a bit of room for an upside move for the euro,”
said Yamauchi. “If the currency breaches the top of the cloud
after the flip, the euro may advance to 120 yen next week at the
earliest.”  The euro was at 116.82 yen at 7:33 a.m. in Tokyo from
116.84 yen in  New York  yesterday. It last traded at 120 yen on
May 4.  Ichimoku analysis is used to predict a currency’s direction
through analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows.
The cloud refers to the area between the first and second
leading span lines on the ichimoku gauge and is used to show an
area where buy orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
