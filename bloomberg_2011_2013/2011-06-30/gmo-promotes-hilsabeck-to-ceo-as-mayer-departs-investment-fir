Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co.
named Brad Hilsabeck chief executive officer of the Boston-based
 money manager , replacing Marc Mayer.  Hilsabeck has been with the firm since 2003 and most
recently served as head of global client relations, GMO said
today in an e-mailed statement. Mayer, who became CEO in March
2009, is leaving to “pursue other interests,” the company said.  Tucker Hewes, a GMO spokesman, declined to elaborate on the
reasons for Mayer’s departure, describing the decision as
“mutually agreed upon.”  “I have confidence that Brad, who knows our style
intimately and has everyone’s trust, will be successful in this
new role,”  Jeremy Grantham , the firm’s chief investment
strategist and co-founder, said in the statement. Grantham is
best known for his bearish investment outlook and for his track
record in identifying stock-market bubbles.  GMO managed $108 billion as of March 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
