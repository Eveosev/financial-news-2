Cricket’s governing body said member
countries will be banned from appointing government officials to
national boards to ensure their independence.  The  International Cricket Council  said today that all
member boards have until June 2012 to implement the reform. A
further 12 months would be allowed before any sanctions would be
considered, the ICC said in an e-mailed  statement .  “This is a significant step towards achieving best
practice,” ICC Chief Executive Officer Haroon Lorgat said in
the statement.  The Dubai-based governing body added that it had noted that
it was a well-established principle of modern sporting
governance that national federations should be autonomous and
free from government interference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
