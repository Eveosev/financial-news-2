Ben Chan, senior vice president of
business planning and strategy at the Hong Kong unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc, said foreign direct investment using yuan may help
boost bond issuance in the currency outside mainland  China .  He made the comments to reporters in  Shanghai  yesterday.
The yuan is a denomination of China’s currency, the renminbi.  On FDI helping yuan bond issuance:  “As for renminbi bonds, there is still a question as to
how to bring bond proceeds back to mainland China. Now it’s
going through on a case-by-case approval, which is less certain.
But if we have an FDI program, it will effectively facilitate
the issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong and overseas.  “If I have more well written policies, I will know what
investments in which companies and which projects will be
allowed, then more bonds can be expected.”  On FDI helping boost yuan asset returns:  “In  Hong Kong , we face a problem that the return on
renminbi deposits is quite low because there is no effective way
to deploy renminbi in the real economy. So there’s huge demand
for foreign direct investment in yuan.”  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
