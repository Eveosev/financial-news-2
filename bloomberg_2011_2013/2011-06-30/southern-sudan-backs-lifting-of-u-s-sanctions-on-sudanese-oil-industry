Southern Sudan ’s government wants
the U.S. to lift sanctions on Sudanese oil, said Riek Machar,
the region’s vice president.  While U.S. economic sanctions imposed against Sudan in 1997
won’t apply to Southern Sudan after its independence on July 9,
they will cover any parts of the southern economy, including
oil, that benefit the north, the Treasury Department’s Office of
Foreign Assets Control said in an  April 12 statement .  “We have no other way to export the oil through South
Sudan, it is only through the north,” Machar told reporters
yesterday in Juba, Southern Sudan’s capital, after returning
from a three-week trip to the U.S. “Therefore, if it continues
to be sanctioned by the U.S., this is not going to affect the
north alone, it is going to affect the south.”  Southern Sudan will assume control of about 75 percent of
Sudan’s daily oil production of 490,000 barrels when it becomes
independent. The crude, pumped mainly by  China National
Petroleum Corp. ,  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd and India’s
Oil & Natural Gas Corp. day, is exported through a pipeline that
runs to  Port Sudan  on the  Red Sea .  Oil earnings accounted for about 98 percent of Southern
Sudan’s 2010 budget.  The sanctions against Sudan will still prohibit U.S.
citizens from “engaging in transactions relating to the
petroleum or petrochemical industry in Sudan, and from
participating in exports to or imports from the new state that
transit through Sudan,” the Treasury Department said in the
April statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
