Plant and machinery orders in
 Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, increased 21 percent in May
from a year earlier, the VDMA machine makers’ association said.  Domestic orders rose an annual 19 percent when adjusted for
inflation, while export orders jumped 21 percent, Frankfurt-
based VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. In the three
months through May, orders gained 20 percent from the year-
earlier period.  “The trend of more moderate order growth in the German
machinery sector continues,” Ralph Wiechers, chief economist at
VDMA, said in the statement. “Many strains of the global
economy this spring probably left their track marks. But there’s
also a positive aspect -- a further overheating of the growth
engine can be avoided.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
