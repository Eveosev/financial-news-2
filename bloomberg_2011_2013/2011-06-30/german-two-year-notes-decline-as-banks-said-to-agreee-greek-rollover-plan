German two-year government notes
declined after the nationâ€™s biggest banks and insurers and the
government were said to have agreed on a draft proposal to roll
over Greek debt holdings.  The yield on the notes climbed three basis points to 1.59
percent as of 10:41 a.m. in  London . Ten-year yields were one
basis point higher at 3 percent.  The financial firms will commit to providing financing for
a Greek aid package and an announcement is planned this
afternoon, said people familiar with the plan, who declined to
be identified because the talks are private. The draft could
still be changed during a meeting today with Finance Minister
 Wolfgang Schaeuble  and top industry executives, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
