“Transformers: Dark of the Moon,”
the third in the movie series from  Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) ’s Paramount
Pictures, collected $37.3 million in box-office sales in the
U.S. and  Canada  yesterday, the best opening-day tally this year.  The film’s revenue totals $42.8 million, including $5.5
million from 3-D previews held on June 28, Hollywood.com Box-
Office said. Three-dimensional screenings accounted for 60
percent of yesterday’s sales, the industry tracker said.  The effects-heavy movie may be a fresh indicator of the
public’s appetite for 3-D, Eric Wold, a New York-based analyst
with Merriman Capital, said in a research note yesterday. Recent
films, including “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger
Tides,” “Kung Fu Panda 2” and “Cars 2,” have collected less
than half of ticket sales from 3-D showings, he said.  Yesterday’s haul topped the $34.8 million generated by Walt
Disney Co.’s “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,” on
May 20. “Transformers” is expected take in as much as $166
million through the July 4 holiday, the estimate of  Box Office
Guru  editor Gitesh Pandya.  The first two “Transformers” films brought in $1.55
billion in worldwide ticket sales, according to researcher Box
Office Mojo.  Viacom, based in  New York , rose 41 cents to $51 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Class B
shares of the company, also the owner of MTV and Nickelodeon,
have advanced 29 percent this year.  RealD Inc. (RLD) , the largest
maker of 3-D projection equipment, lost 2 cents to $23.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
