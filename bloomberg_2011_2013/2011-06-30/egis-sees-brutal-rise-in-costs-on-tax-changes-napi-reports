Hungarian drugmaker Egis Nyrt.
expects its costs to “rise brutally” as a result of an
increased special tax on pharmaceutical companies,  Napi Gazdasag 
said, citing Egis Chief Financial Officer Csaba Poroszlai.  The company will calculate the exact impact of the changes
once the new law is published, Napi cited Poroszlai as saying.  The levy, which drugmakers pay on sales of subsidized
medicines, will rise to 20 percent from 12 percent on July 1 and
medical representative fees will double, the newspaper said.  Under the new law, Egis will only be able to deduct 50
percent of its research and development costs from the special
tax this year, as opposed to a planned 100 percent deduction,
Poroszlai said, according to Napi.  The changes may boost Egis’ costs by 2 billion forint ($11
million), the newspaper said, citing unidentified analysts.  -- Editor:  Chris Peterson   To contact the reporter on this story:
