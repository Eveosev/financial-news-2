Renault SA (RNO) ,  France ’s second-largest
carmaker, will unveil a redesigned Twingo mini car in September,
marking the start of an effort to freshen the brand’s styling to
revive flagging sales.  The updated Twingo, which will go on sale shortly after
being shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show, is the first test of
Renault’s new design chief to impact sales since he joined the
carmaker in late 2009.  The Twingo upgrade is a “quick and dirty” mid-life
facelift rather than an all-new vehicle, Laurens van den Acker,
Renault’s top designer, said in an interview yesterday. “We’ve
tried to give the car more personality, so that you feel you’re
connected with it.”  Renault’s share of the western European market declined to
8.4 percent last year from 10.7 percent in 2002. Production of
the four-year-old Twingo model in Novo Mesto, Slovenia, dropped
14 percent to 153,599 vehicles in 2010, almost three times the
rate of the European auto market’s overall decline.  The new Twingo is limited to upgrades of the front and rear
end, “because the investments are otherwise too high,” van den
Acker said. “I think it came out alright.”  The 45-year-old design chief, who joined the Boulogne-
Billancourt, France-based carmaker from Mazda Motor Corp., said
he has finalized the design for the next-generation Clio
subcompact, his first complete overhaul of a Renault model. The
vehicle, which will be premiered next year, has more
“muscular” lines, he said, adding that the model will be
unveiled ahead of the 2012 Paris Motor Show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
