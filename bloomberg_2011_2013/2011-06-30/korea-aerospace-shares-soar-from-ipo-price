Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., the
country’s largest planemaker, surged on its first day of trading
in  Seoul  after raising about $530 million in the nation’s
largest initial public offering this year.  The company known as KAI jumped 39 percent to 21,550 won as
of 10:56 a.m. on the Korea Exchange, from the IPO price of
15,500 won. The shares are headed for the biggest debut gain for
any IPO in South Korea worth more than 50 billion won ($47
million) this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The planemaker, which won a $400 million contract in May to
sell 16 T-50 trainer jets to  Indonesia , expects the first export
order for the aircraft may also help it win sales in  Israel ,
 Poland  and the U.S. KAI’s share sale takes total initial
offerings in  South Korea  to almost 3 trillion won this year,
down from more than 8 trillion won in the first six months of
last year, according to Bloomberg data.  “The demand for KAI’s supersonic trainer jets will rise
with the growing adoption of more advanced fighter jets at many
countries,” Lee Sang Woo, an analyst with Taurus Investment &
Securities Co., said by telephone today. Lee rated the Sacheon,
South Korea-based company “buy” in new coverage and set a
share-price estimate of 25,200 won.  Part of the proceeds from the 567.5 billion won share sale
will be used to develop new KF-X fighter jets and KAH attack
helicopters, the company said in a June 21 filing.  Pricing Range  KAI and shareholders including  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and
Samsung Techwin Co., sold 36.6 million new and existing shares
after marketing the stock at 14,000 won to 16,000 won. Woori
Investment & Securities Co. and Hyundai Securities Co. managed
the initial share sale.  “The company’s parts supplies to commercial aircraft are
also likely to generate stable sales,” Lee said.  KAI, which also makes wing parts for Airbus SAS and Boeing
Co., is targeting to boost sales to 4.3 trillion won in 2020,
from 1.27 trillion won last year. The planemaker aims to earn
more than 60 percent of sales overseas by 2020, rising from 39
percent in 2010.  South Korean arms exports reached a record $1.2 billion in
2009. The government said last year that it aims to boost annual
overseas sales of weapons to $4 billion and expand total
production to $10 billion in 2020.  State-run Korea Finance Corp., KAI’s largest shareholder,
will begin selling its 25.7 million shares later this year,
Chief Executive Officer Ryu Jae Han told lawmakers June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
