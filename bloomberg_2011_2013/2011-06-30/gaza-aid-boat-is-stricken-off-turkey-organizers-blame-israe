Greece  banned ships intending to
travel to the  Gaza Strip  from leaving Greek ports, the
government said.  The coast guard has been ordered to take “all appropriate
measures” to enforce the decision, the citizen protection
ministry said in a statement released in Athens today.
“Furthermore, the broader maritime area of the eastern
Mediterranean will be continuously monitored by electronic means
for tracking, where applicable, the movements of the ships
allegedly participating in such campaign.”  A vessel carrying several dozen American protesters that
left port without permission was ordered to return, the
Associated Press reported.  The ships are part of a flotilla aimed at breaking Israel’s
blockade of the Gaza Strip. The organizers have said they will
carry aid. An Irish boat yesterday sustained damage off  Turkey ’s
coast that organizers attributed to sabotage. Israel denied any
involvement.  Israel said it won’t allow the flotilla to reach the Hamas-
controlled Gaza Strip. A previous Gaza flotilla’s attempt ended
in violence in which nine Turks were killed on May 31 last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
