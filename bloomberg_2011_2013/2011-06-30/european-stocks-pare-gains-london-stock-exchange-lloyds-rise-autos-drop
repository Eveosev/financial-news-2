European stocks pared gains, after
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index yesterday posted the biggest rally in
three months, as carmakers retreated. Asian equities and U.S.
futures advanced.  London  Stock Exchange Group Plc jumped 4.7 percent after
scrapping its bid for TMX Group Inc. and UBS AG said the bourse
may now be a bid target. Lloyds Banking Group Plc surged 8.3
percent after the U.K.â€™s biggest mortgage lender said it will
make savings of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2014. BG
Group Plc surged 4.4 percent after doubling its estimate of
reserves and resources in the Santos Basin in  Brazil .  The Stoxx 600 rose less than 0.1 percent to 269.85 at 11:50
a.m. in London. The benchmark measure yesterday advanced 1.7
percent, the largest gain since March 21, after Greek lawmakers
approved a package of austerity measures to help secure
financial aid. The gauge has lost 2.2 percent this quarter,
snapping three quarters of gains, on concern that  Greece  will
fail to repay all its debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
