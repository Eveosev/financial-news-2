Hungarian producer-price growth, an
early indicator of inflation trends, was the slowest in more
than a year in May.  Factory-gate prices advanced 1.2 percent from a year
earlier, the slowest since April 2010, compared with 4.9 percent
in April, the Budapest-based  statistics office  said today in an
e-mail. The median estimate of seven economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 1.5 percent. Prices rose 0.1 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
