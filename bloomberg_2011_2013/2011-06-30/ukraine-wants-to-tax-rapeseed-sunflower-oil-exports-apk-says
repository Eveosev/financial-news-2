Ukraine wants to tax
exports of sunflower oil and rapeseed, APK-Inform reported,
citing a draft of the proposal by the  Economy Ministry .  An export duty of 10 percent for sunflower oil, or not less
than 90 euros ($130) a metric ton, is being proposed, APK-
Inform, a Dnipropetrovsk-based agriculture researcher, said on
its  website  today. Rapeseedâ€™s duty would be 11 percent or not
less than 53 euros a ton, it said.  Ukraine will begin taxing grain exports tomorrow for the
first time since it obtained independence from the  Soviet Union 
in 1991. The government wants to control exports to keep
inflation about 8 percent to 9 percent a year.  Rye, oats, millet and buckwheat would be subject to a 50
percent export duty under the proposal, according to APK-Inform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
