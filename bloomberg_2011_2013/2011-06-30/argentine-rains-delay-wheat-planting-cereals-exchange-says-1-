Planting of  Argentina ’s wheat crop,
 Latin America ’s largest, was delayed by rains over the past
week, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said.  About 2.7 million hectares of the crop have been planted,
the exchange said in its weekly crop report sent by e-mail
today. The exchange  forecasts  the crop will cover 4.95 million
hectares, up from 4.7 million a year earlier. The bulk of the
2011-2012 harvest will occur between December and February.  Argentina was likely the world’s fifth-largest exporter of
wheat in the year through today, according to estimates by the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . The South American nation was
the eighth-largest exporter of the grain last year.  Rains also delayed harvesting of the current soybean and
corn crops, which were planted mostly in the second half of last
year and the first months of this year, the exchange said. About
17.2 million tons of corn have been harvested from a total
estimate of 20 million tons, the exchange said. About 200,000
million tons of soybeans remain to be harvested from the
estimated crop of 49.2 million tons, the exchange said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
