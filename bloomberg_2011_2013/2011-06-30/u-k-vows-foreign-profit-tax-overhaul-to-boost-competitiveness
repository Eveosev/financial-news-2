Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  proposed to overhaul rules on taxing foreign profits in
an effort to persuade companies to keep their headquarters in
Britain.  The government will target companies that artificially
divert U.K. profits to avoid tax, while exempting genuine
foreign profit from tax, the Treasury said in a statement in
 London  today. The rules govern the taxation of profits made
overseas by British-based companies.  “As the market place has become increasingly globalized,
the U.K. has lost competitiveness,” Treasury minister David
Gauke said. The changes will “help us to rectify this and
ensure that the corporate tax regime is once again an asset for
the U.K.”  Osborne is seeking to reassure companies that he will
introduce policies to boost economic growth as he embarks on the
deepest cuts in  government spending  since World War II. In
recent years, companies including drugmaker Shire Plc relocated
their headquarters abroad to reduce costs.  A consultation period runs until Sept. 22 and is part of
a plan to have the overhauled system in place in 2012. In March,
Osborne said he will tax finance companies at 5.75 percent on
foreign profits by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
