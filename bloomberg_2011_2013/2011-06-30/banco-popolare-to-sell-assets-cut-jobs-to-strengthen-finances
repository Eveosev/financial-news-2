Banco Popolare SC (BP) ,  Italy ’s fourth-
biggest bank, plans to sell real-estate assets and cut more than
1,000 jobs to boost capital and profit as part of its five-year
business plan.  The lender forecasts net income of 603 million euros ($874
million) in 2013 and 930 million euros in 2015, compared with
308 million euros last year, the Verona-based bank said today in
a statement. Popolare plans to sell properties for about 500
million euros, eliminate 1,120 jobs and close 180 branches.  Chief Executive Officer Pier Francesco Saviotti is cutting
costs and selling non-strategic assets to recover from losses
linked to the company’s Italease unit. The bank sold 2 billion
euros in shares through a rights offer earlier this year before
a second round of stress tests.  Saviotti said he is “absolutely tranquil” about the
stress tests. “Data show that the core tier 1 minimum level of
5 percent under stress is amply exceeded,” he said during the
plan’s presentation in Milan. The CEO ruled out a new capital
increase to raise money.  Banco Popolare rose as much as 3.8 percent today in Milan
trading and was up 2.4 percent at 1.56 euros at 3 p.m. local
time, giving the company a market value of 2.8 billion euros.  Banco Popolare expects its common equity ratio, a measure
of financial strength under Basel III rules, to be 7.6 percent
in 2013 and 8.3 percent in 2015. The lender targets a dividend
payout of 40 percent a year over the period.  “The targets are in line with expectations,” Giovanni Razzoli, an analyst at Equita Sim SPA who has a “buy”
recommendation on the stock, wrote in a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
