Sunderland said midfielder  Craig
Gardner , 24, joined the Premier League soccer club from

Dragons, respectively.  Wickham joined for an 8 million-pound ($12.8 million)
transfer fee that could rise to 12 million pounds. Ji’s fee was
undisclosed.  Sunderland announced the Gardner deal on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
