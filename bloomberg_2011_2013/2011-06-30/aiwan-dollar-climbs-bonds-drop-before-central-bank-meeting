Taiwan ’s dollar rose the most in two
months as sentiment toward emerging-market debt improved as
lawmakers in Greece passed austerity measures needed to win
European Union Funds.  Government bonds fell for a third day as the benchmark
Taiex Index of local shares climbed. The  Central Bank  of  China 
(Taiwan) will lift its benchmark interest rate by 12.5 basis
points to 1.875 percent at a review today, according to all 18
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The markets were supported by the fact that Greece’s
problem has been solved temporarily,” said  Frances Cheung , a
senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in  Hong Kong . “Taiwan
yields have been rising on expectations the central bank will
raise rates.”  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.4 percent, the most since
April 28, to NT$28.802 against its U.S. counterpart as of 4 p.m.
in Taipei. It touched NT$28.70 earlier, the strongest level
since June 10, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency
declined 0.1 percent in June, trimming this quarter’s gain to
2.1 percent.  The yield on the 1.375 percent notes due March 2021, the
most-traded government securities, rose two basis points to
1.507 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That was
the biggest increase since June 22. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The consumer-price index rose 1.66 percent in May from a
year earlier, compared with 1.32 percent the previous month, the
government reported this month. Prices increased 1.80 percent in
June, according to the median estimate of analysts in a
Bloomberg survey before data due on July 5.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, rose one basis point to 0.362, according
to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money
Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
