Cattle futures dropped to the lowest
in almost two weeks on bets that bigger-than-expected corn
supplies may reduce feed costs, encouraging U.S. producers to
expand their herds. Hogs fell.  About 92.282 million acres (37.3 million hectares) of corn
were planted, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today, up
from 92.178 million forecast in March following a survey of
farmers’ intentions. The grain is a primary ingredient in
livestock feed.  “This is a knee-jerk reaction to the grain report,” said
David Kruse, the president of CommStock Investments Inc. in
Royal,  Iowa . “What a lot of people feared is these high grain
prices would ultimately reduce pork and beef production.”  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.875 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $1.107 a pound at 10:46 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the price touched $1.096, the
lowest since June 17.  The most-active contract gained 3 percent this year through
yesterday. Before today, the price dropped 7.8 percent this
quarter, which ends today.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 1.6 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $1.39375 a pound. Before today, the most-
active contract declined 2.4 percent since March 31.  Hog futures for August settlement fell 1.1 cents, or 1.2
percent, to 92.075 cents a pound. Before today, the price
plunged 10 percent this quarter. The commodity is still up 17
percent this year before today.  Commodities prices have been supported by government
spending programs to revive growth. Before today, the Thomson
Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials jumped 32
percent in the past 12 months.  The  Federal Reserve ’s second round of so-called
quantitative easing concludes today. The Fed plans to buy back
between $4 billion and $5 billion of notes due from December
2016 to June 2018. The purchases will be the last in the central
bank’s effort to add $600 billion to the economy, according to
its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
