Germany ’s first offshore wind farm
is generating more power than expected, the operators of Alpha
Ventus said today.  The 12 turbines off the island of Borkum generated at least
190 gigawatt-hours of electricity the past nine months, 5
percent more than expected. That’s due to strong winds at sea
even as winds on land were weak, operators EON AG, Vattenfall
Europe AG and EWE AG said today in an e-mailed statement.  The 5-megawatt turbines, supplied by Areva Wind GmbH, a
German unit of Paris-based Areva SA, and REpower Systems SE,
were operational almost 98 percent of the time, the group said.  The test farm about 30 miles (48 kilometers) off Borkum in
the  North Sea  went into operation last year. The German
government plans to have 10,000 megawatts of offshore wind
capacity installed by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
