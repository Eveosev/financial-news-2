United Development Co. (UDCD) , a real-
estate and energy investor in Qatar, said it terminated
contracts with Building and Construction Real Estate Co. to
build two apartment towers.  UDC said it took over the project to build towers 2A and 3B
in the Porto Arabia section of The Pearl, a residential and
commercial development on man-made Islands off the Qatari coast.
The towers are due to be completed by the second quarter of
2013, UDC media coordinator Sarie Botes said in an e-mail.  They should have been ready two years from the day
technical drawings and maps were approved, she said, adding that
UDC took over the project “to safeguard investors’ rights and
investments.”  Building and Construction Real Estate Co. couldn’t be
reached for comment.  Each tower will have 20 residential floors with 476
apartments, 50 percent of which have already been sold, Botes
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
