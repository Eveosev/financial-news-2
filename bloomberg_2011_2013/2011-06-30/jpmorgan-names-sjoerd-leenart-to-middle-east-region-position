JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-

officer for the Middle East and North Africa.  Leenart will be based in Dubai and report to Emilio Saracho, head of investment banking for  Europe , the Middle East
and Africa, New York-based JPMorgan said today in a statement.
The bank also hired Emre Derman as senior country officer for

banking and asset management.  “These appointments represent our continued commitment to
the region,” Saracho said in the statement. “We have made no
secret about our expansion plans and we are confident that
Sjoerd and Emre will continue to grow and maximize opportunities
in those markets.”  Leenart has worked at JPMorgan for 17 years and was co-head
of debt capital markets and sales and marketing for Central and
Eastern Europe, the  Middle East , Africa and Latin America,
according to the statement. Derman joins the bank following a
legal career advising on corporate transactions in the Turkish
market. He was a senior associate and partner at White & Case
LLP in Istanbul and  London  for 18 years.  Leenart and Derman succeed Murad Megalli, the former head
of the region who was killed in a plane crash this year.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
