 Oil rose for a third day, erasing
its decline since the  International Energy Agency  announced the
release of emergency stockpiles on June 23. Futures are still
headed for their first quarterly loss in a year.  Crude for August delivery rose as much as 67 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $95.44 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $95.29 at 1:21 p.m.
Singapore time. The contract settled at $95.41 a barrel on June
22, the day before the IEA said it would release 60 million
barrels from strategic reserves, prompting a plunge in prices to
as low as $89.69.  Prices are 26 percent higher the past year. Crude is down
11 percent in the second quarter, the first decline since the
period ended June 30, 2010, after  Europe â€™s debt crisis bolstered
speculation fuel demand will shrink.  Brent oil for August settlement traded 27 cents higher at
$112.67 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
today. The European benchmark contract traded at a premium of
$17.37 to West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade. The
spread reached a record $22.29 a barrel on June 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
