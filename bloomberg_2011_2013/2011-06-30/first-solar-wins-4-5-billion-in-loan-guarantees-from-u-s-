First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest maker of thin-film solar modules, won $4.5 billion in
conditional loan guarantees from the U.S. Energy Department for
three projects it’s developing in  California .  First Solar’s Topaz and Desert Sunlight projects, which
will each have 550 megawatts of capacity, and its 230-megawatt
Solar Ranch project were each offered low-cost financing needed
to begin construction, the Energy Department said today in an e-
mailed statement. The agency must distribute all the funds
before the loan guarantee program expires at the end of
September.  The Energy Department has offered conditional loans or loan
guarantees to 40 clean energy projects totaling $38 billion,
including $16 billion for solar energy projects. First Solar’s
290-megawatt Agua Caliente project in  Arizona , which is being
built for  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , in January won approval for a loan
guarantee of as much as $967 million.  First Solar said construction on those approved today will
add 1,400 jobs and that the more than 20 million cadmium
telluride glass panels used in the projects will be manufactured
at plants in Ohio and Arizona.  First Solar rose $6.83 or 5.3 percent to $136.25 at 9:30
a.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Before
today’s gain, the shares had risen 14 percent since Jan. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
