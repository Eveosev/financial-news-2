Asahi Breweries Ltd. (2502)  and Kirin
Holdings Co. will jointly distribute some beverages in  Tokyo  to
cut costs and emissions at the nation’s two largest beermakers.  The joint deliveries using light-duty trucks in six of
Tokyo’s 23 wards will begin from Aug. 29 and will be expanded at
the end of October, according to a statement from the companies
today. Asahi and Kirin will also jointly collect containers such
as bins and kegs in some areas of the country, they said.  Asahi and Kirin are looking to lower expenses as a
shrinking population saps demand for beer in  Japan . The
partnership will reduce costs by several hundred million yen, or
several million dollars, Asahi Breweries Executive Vice
President Kazuo Motoyama told reporters today in Tokyo. The main
purpose is to help the environment by reducing  carbon emissions ,
he said.  Shipments of regular, low-malt and alternative beers fell
1.3 percent in the first five months of this year, according to
data provided by the two Tokyo-based companies. Brewery sales
have declined by about 20 percent since a 1994 peak, the data
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
