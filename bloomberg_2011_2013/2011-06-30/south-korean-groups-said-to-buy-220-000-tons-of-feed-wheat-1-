Two South Korean feed groups
purchased a total of 220,000 metric tons of wheat for delivery
in October and November in a joint tender, according to two
industry executives who took part in the bidding.  The Major Feedmill Group and members of the Korea Feed
Association in Busan paid $273.90 a ton for the four 55,000-ton
cargoes on a cost and freight basis, the executives said today,
asking not to be identified because tender results are
confidential.  To contact the reporter on this story:
