Atsuto Sawakami, the president of
Sawakami Asset Management Inc., resigned his post at the mutual
fund he founded more than a decade ago, now  Japan ’s second
biggest, and will become chairman of the firm.  Mitsuaki Kuroshima, 44, the fund’s chief analyst, will
replace Sawakami, 64, as of today, the Tokyo-based company said
in a statement. Sawakami will remain as chief investment
officer, it said.  The change in management comes after Sawakami said in 2009
that he planned to cede control of day-to-day operations to do
more public speaking. The former head of Pictet & Cie. in Japan
pioneered selling investments directly to individuals after the
country ended a monopoly held by brokerages in 1998.  Sawakami Asset, with 241 billion yen ($3 billion), is
second in size to FMR LLC’s  Fidelity Japan Growth Fund (32311984)  among
Japanese equity mutual funds that invest in the country’s
stocks. The  Sawakami fund (71311998)  has lost 2.5 percent this year through
June 23, compared with an 8.2 percent decline by the benchmark
Topix index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Kuroshima, who joined Sawakami Asset in 2008, will be only
the firms second president since being founded in 1999.  Sawakami graduated from Aichi Prefectural University and
studied international economics at the University of Geneva. He
began his career in finance in 1970 as an analyst and then
adviser in the Geneva office of Los Angeles-based Capital Group
Cos. He returned to Japan in 1974 and trained analysts and fund
managers at Yamaichi Securities Co. before being named the local
representative of Geneva-based Pictet in 1980.  To contact the reporters on this story:
