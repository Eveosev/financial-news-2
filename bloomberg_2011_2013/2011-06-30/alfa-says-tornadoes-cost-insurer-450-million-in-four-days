Alfa Insurance, the policyholder-
owned company started in 1946 to provide fire coverage to
farmers, said storms in the U.S. Southeast from April 25 to
April 28 will cost the firm about $450 million.  The losses include claims tied to an April 27 tornado that
killed more than 40 people in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama , said Jeff
