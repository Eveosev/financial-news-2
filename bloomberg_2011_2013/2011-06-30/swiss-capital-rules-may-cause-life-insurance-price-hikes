Swiss life and health insurers
including  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  may ask their clients to pay
more for insurance cover as new capital rules boost operating
costs, Ernst & Young said.  To meet  capital requirements  under the so-called Swiss
solvency test, insurers may have to adjust internal processes,
buy more reinsurance or review their current products, according
to a study by the consulting company. Insurers don’t expect to
change their pricing models in general, Ernst & Young said in
the study published today.  The solvency test introduced in January requires insurers
to provide a mark-to-market valuation of assets and liabilities
that for the first time takes into account their investment
portfolios.  “Adjustments of the investment portfolio, buying
additional reinsurance, or launching new products were all
separated decisions under the old solvency regime,” Hans- Juergen Wolter, a Zurich-based partner at Ernst & Young and
former Chief Risk Officer at Swiss Life, said in an interview.
“Now these decisions have an impact on your solvency ratio.”  The study surveyed 10 health, 17 life and 13 non-life
insurers as well as 10 reinsurers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
