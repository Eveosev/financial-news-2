Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared,
seeking to quell criticism of its proposed $15 billion wireless
venture, told regulators it would resolve potential interference
for more than 99 percent of global-positioning system users.  LightSquared won’t initially use all of its allocated
airwaves and is prepared to work with GPS users affected by its
proposed service for 260 million people, according to a filing
today with the Federal Communications Commission, which
regulates spectrum.  The company’s network would use airwaves previously
reserved mainly for satellite services. Makers and users of GPS
devices including  farm-equipment  maker  Deere & Co. (DE)  say
LightSquared will overwhelm their signals, which come from
satellites, and disrupt navigation by aircraft, boats, tractors
and cars. The GPS industry has urged regulators to revoke
preliminary approval for the venture and make it use different
airwaves.  Not letting LightSquared proceed using its authorized
spectrum “would doom an innovative American start-up company,”
Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared said in its FCC filing.
“The commercial GPS device industry wants the commission to
shut down an unprecedented effort to establish a nationwide
wireless broadband network.”  “LightSquared must begin to deploy its network immediately
or it may not survive,” the company told the FCC.  Lightsquared’s plans “in all their various shifting
iterations” if carried out, would cause unacceptable
interference to GPS services deployed in  law enforcement ,
aviation and other fields, the  Coalition to Save Our GPS , a
group of GPS makers and users, said in a statement today.  FCC Review  LightSquared outlined its proposal in comments it filed
alongside a technical report requested by the FCC. That report,
written by a group that included officials from LightSquared,
the GPS industry, and the U.S. government, offered results of
tests for interference from the proposed service.  “The agency’s expert staff will now conduct a thorough and
expeditious review of the report,” Neil Grace, a spokesman for
the agency, said in an e-mail.  The FCC on Jan. 26 granted LightSquared preliminary
approval, and said the company couldn’t begin commercial
operation until interference concerns were resolved.  The agency will open a comment period on the working
group’s report that ends August 15, Grace said.  “Nevertheless, our nation cannot afford to let spectrum go
underutilized,” he said. “America’s economic growth and global
competitiveness are on the line.”  ‘Significant Interference’  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, plans to invest $15 billion to build a
wholesale wireless service using 40,000 base stations.  The plan to limit initial operations to airwaves furthest
from GPS uses would pose no risk to more than 99 percent of GPS
users, and LightSquared is offering to underwrite “a workable
solution for the small number” of GPS devices “that may be at
risk,” the company said in its filing.  GPS users said it wasn’t clear that interference would be
resolved for 99 percent of devices.  “We don’t think that’s anywhere near accurate,” Jim Kirkland, general counsel of  Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) , said
during a conference call today.  In one test of the airwaves LightSquared now proposes for
its initial use, six of 49 mobile telephones for consumers
failed, he said. “Even the data on that lower band shows
significant interference,” Kirkland said.  ‘Massive Interference’  Studies submitted with today’s report to the FCC show
“consistent and overwhelming evidence that LightSquared’s
proposed operations would cause massive interference to every
type of GPS device,” Kirkland said in the coalition’s
statement. “There is no current, existing technology that
solves this interference.”  The coalition, formed to oppose LightSquared’s plans, lists
members including package shippers  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS) , GPS-unit makers Trimble and  Garmin Ltd. (GRMN)  and the
 Air Transport Association  with members  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and
 AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines .  LightSquared intends “ultimately to deploy a network using
a full complement of terrestrial frequencies,” the company said
in its filing.  “This issue will be resolved by good data, smart engineers
and good-faith problem-solving dialog,” Ahuja said.  LightSquared first made its reduced-airwaves offer on June
20. Lawmakers and witnesses at a congressional hearing last week
said more tests are needed. Deere, the world’s largest maker of
farm equipment, had said previously that LightSquared will
interfere with agricultural gear even if it follows its plan to
lessen interference.  OnStar Interference  A U.S. advisory panel that examined LightSquared’s initial
plan concluded the service would degrade GPS navigation devices
as far away as outer space and recommended that the FCC revoke
the tentative approval it granted to the company in January.  Tests found that LightSquared disrupts  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
OnStar navigation service and equipment used by the Defense
Department and the aviation industry, according to a study
released June 9.  LightSquared’s original plan “is not compatible” with GPS
operation, Roy Kienitz, undersecretary for policy at the U.S.
Transportation Department, said at a congressional hearing June
23.  “That doesn’t mean the story is over,” Kienitz said.
LightSquared’s alternative “has promise” and “any plan needs
to be thoroughly tested before it goes forward,” he said.  The report LightSquared delivered today was due by July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
