Hungarian bonds rose a fourth day
before a debt auction after  Greece ’s government took the first
step in adopting an austerity plan aimed at averting a default
and stopping the crisis from infecting other European nations.  The yield on the government notes maturing in 2017 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.077 percent at 10
a.m. in Budapest. The state will auction a total 45 billion
forint ($245 million) in bonds maturing in 2014, 2017 and 2028,
according to data from the Debt Management Agency on Bloomberg.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won approval for his
78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget cuts and asset
sales aimed at meeting European aid requirements and will face a
second vote on the implementation of the plan.  “The market was filled with optimism as the probability of
a Greek default decreased substantially, although the debt
situation hasn’t been solved yet,” analysts at Erste Group Bank
AG including Zoltan Arokszallasi in Budapest wrote in a research
note today.  The forint depreciated 0.1 percent to 265.66 per euro,
after strengthening 1.3 percent yesterday, the biggest rally
since November.  Hungary’s first-quarter current account surplus rose to 787
million euros, the largest quarterly figure on record, compared
with a revised 360 million euros in the last quarter of 2010,
the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
