U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said today that he will keep his job “for the
foreseeable future.”  “I’ve only worked in public service. But you know, I live
for this work. It’s the only thing I’ve ever done,” Geithner
said when asked about his future plans by former President  Bill Clinton  during a forum today in Chicago. “I believe in it. We
have a lot of challenges as a country.  The Treasury secretary continued: “I’m going to be doing
it for the foreseeable future. People are a little worried, or
interested, because I have a family and my son’s going back to
 New York  to finish high school and I’m going to be commuting for
a while. But I’m going to be doing this for the foreseeable
future.”  Geithner commented after Bloomberg News reported he has
signaled to White House officials that he’s considering leaving
the administration after President Barack Obama reaches an
agreement with Congress to raise the federal debt limit,
according to three people familiar with the matter.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
