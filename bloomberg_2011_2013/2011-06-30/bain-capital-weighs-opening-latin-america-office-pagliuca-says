Bain Capital  LLC, the U.S. buyout
fund manager, is considering setting up a team in Latin America
as the firm looks to boost investments in emerging markets,
Managing Director Stephen Pagliuca said.  “Central and  South America  is starting to show the
robustness that makes it attractive for private equity and
specifically Bain Capital’s model in the future,” Pagliuca said
in an interview at the Super Return Conference Emerging Markets
Conference in Geneva today. Opening an office and hiring a team
there are “areas under consideration,” he said.  Leveraged-buyout firms including Boston-based Bain Capital
are turning to emerging markets to tap faster growth than in
Western economies as investors look for higher returns. Bain
Capital manages a $1 billion fund dedicated to  Asia  with offices
in Mumbai,  Hong Kong  and Shanghai. It hired banks to manage an
initial public offering of India’s Lilliput Kidswear Ltd., a
clothing maker it owns, two people with knowledge of the matter
said this week.  Latin America and especially Brazil are attracting firms
because of its large natural resources and growing middle class,
leading to higher spending on consumer goods. The Carlyle Group,
one of the world’s largest private-equity managers, said on June
15 it raised $1 billion to invest in South American companies,
with an emphasis on Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
