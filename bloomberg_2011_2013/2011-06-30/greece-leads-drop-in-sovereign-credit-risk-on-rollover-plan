Greece  led a decline in the cost of
insuring European sovereign debt after  Germany ’s biggest banks
and insurers were said to agree on proposals to roll over their
holdings.  Credit-default swaps on Greece dropped for a third day,
falling 47 basis points to 1,898, according to CMA at 10:30 a.m.
in London. The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps
on 15 governments declined 7 basis points to 222.  The German firms will commit to providing financing for a
Greek aid package later today, according to people familiar with
the plan. The deal follows Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
winning approval for a 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of
budget cuts and asset sales yesterday, postponing a default.  “We fear that the latest solution will be just another
Russian doll,” said Anke Richter, a strategist at Mizuho
Securities in London.  The German draft could still be changed during a meeting
today with Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and top industry
executives, the people said.  Contracts on Greece, which are still headed for a fifth
monthly increase and are up from 1,010 basis points Dec. 31,
signal an 80 percent chance the nation will default within five
years. The sovereign gauge is headed for a third monthly rise
and is up from 207.75 basis points at the start of the year.  Measures of corporate and financial credit risk and swaps
on Europe’s other peripheral governments also pared monthly
increases.  Portuguese Risk  Swaps on Portugal fell 12 basis points today to 763,
Ireland declined 16 to 743 and  Spain  dropped 8 to 270, while
Italy fell 5 to 173 and Belgium was 7 lower at 144, according to
CMA. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit
quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 3
basis points to 406, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined 1.25 basis point to 108.75
basis points. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior
debt of 25 banks and insurers decreased 3.5 basis points to
159.5 and the subordinated index dropped 4 to 280.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
