Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s
brokerage asked a judge to force  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  to pay $346 million owed to the defunct firm.  ABN Amro, now owned by Royal Bank, owes the money, plus
interest, to Lehman Brothers Inc. for early termination of a
1998 swap agreement, the brokerage said in a filing in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Royal Bank refuses to pay, saying
it has a right to set off the funds against amounts owed to it
by the brokerage and its affiliates, brokerage trustee James Giddens said in yesterday’s filing.  “The trustee has a right to recover the withheld funds
based on simple and straightforward principles of contract
law,” he said.  Pholida Phengsomphone, a spokeswoman in Connecticut for
Edinburgh-based Royal Bank, declined to comment.  The Lehman brokerage, like its bankrupt parent, is seeking
money from banks it did business with to pay customers.
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  last month asked a judge to dismiss most of a
$1.3 billion lawsuit brought by Giddens, saying he had no legal
claim on most of the money.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  has said it will appeal a judge’s order that
it return $2 billion in margin assets to Giddens and pay about
$270 million in interest.  The Lehman parent filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S.
history on Sept. 15, 2008. The brokerage went into liquidation
four days later.  The brokerage bankruptcy case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., 08-01420, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
