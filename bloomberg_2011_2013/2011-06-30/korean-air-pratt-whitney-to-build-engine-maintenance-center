Korean Air  Lines Co. and Pratt &
Whitney will build a 120 billion won ($112 million) plane-engine
maintenance center at Incheon airport, near Seoul.  The facility, due to open in 2014, will be able to service
200 engines annually by 2020 when it will also post sales of
more than 1 trillion won, the Seoul-based carrier said in an e-
mailed statement today. The center will support powerplants for
planes including Boeing Co. 777s and  787 s, and Airbus SAS A380s.  Korean Air owns 90 percent of the venture, called Incheon
Aviation Tech.  Pratt & Whitney , a unit of  United Technologies
Corp. (UTX) , owns the other 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
