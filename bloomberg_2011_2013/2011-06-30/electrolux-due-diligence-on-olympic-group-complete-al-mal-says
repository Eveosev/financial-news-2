Electrolux AB (ELUXB) ’s due diligence on its
acquisition target  Olympic Group Financial Investments (OLGR)  has been
completed,  Al Mal  reported, citing Niazi Salam, deputy chairman
of Olympic’s majority shareholder Paradise Capital.  Electrolux will likely pay less for all of the shares of
the Egyptian appliance maker than the 2.7 billion Egyptian
pounds ($452 million) initially agreed upon because of Olympic’s
decline in revenue due to political unrest in  Egypt , the Cairo-
based newspaper cited Salam as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
