Maine ’s Bates College is the most
expensive private, nonprofit college in the U.S., with its
$51,300 price tag in 2009-2010 leading a new government list
designed to hold schools accountable for costs.  The price for Bates, in Lewiston, Maine, included tuition,
fees and room plus board. That was followed by Connecticut
College in  New London , which cost $51,115 for the same expenses
and  Vermont ’s Middlebury College, which charged $50,780,
according to the list of college prices released today on a U.S.
Department of Education  website . The average tuition without
room and board for private nonprofit colleges in 2009-10 was
$21,324.  The department is publicizing colleges with the highest and
lowest costs, as well as the fastest rising tuition, as part of
2008’s U.S. Higher Education Opportunity Act. Universities are
required to report their tuition and their average “net
price,” which includes the amount they give in financial aid,
said David Bergeron, a deputy assistant secretary.  “For traditional families with students graduating high
school, that information is going to be very helpful,” Bergeron
said in a conference call with reporters yesterday.  Bates doesn’t break out its costs in separate components
for tuition, meals and housing, said Roland Adams, a spokesman.
The college offers financial aid to about 40 percent of its
students and their average cost to attend is $20,897, placing
the school 462 on the list of schools with the highest “net
price,” Adams said in a phone interview.  ‘Very, Very Expensive’  “It’s very, very expensive to offer a liberal arts
education of the extremely high quality that Bates offers,”
Adams said. “Bates has worked very hard at keeping its costs
and growth in those costs as low as possible.”  Counting tuition alone, Sarah Lawrence College, in
Bronxville,  New York , topped the government list of private
nonprofit universities, charging $41,968 in 2009-2010.  Columbia University  in New York was listed as the most
expensive institution in the  Ivy League , a group of eight
private colleges in the Northeast. It charged $41,316 for
tuition, not including room and board, in 2009-10, making it
ninth-highest on the list of private nonprofit universities.  For 2010-2011, Columbia’s total cost of attendance, which
includes tuition, fees, books room and board was $59,208,
according to the university  website .  Public Universities  The most expensive four-year public university was the main
campus of  Pennsylvania State University , in  State College , which
charged state residents $14,416 in tuition. It was followed by
the  University of Pittsburgh , which charged $14,154, and the
University of Vermont in Burlington, which charged $13,554.  The average public university tuition was $6,397.  The most costly for-profit, four-year college on the list
was Sanford-Brown College, which provides training in health
care and business and is owned by  Career Education Corp (CECO) , based
in Schaumburg,  Illinois . Sanford-Brown charged $45,628 in
tuition and required fees at its Vienna, Virginia, campus,
according to the education department website.  That figure is incorrect, and is the cost of attending
Sanford-Brown for four years, said Mark Spencer, a spokesman for
Career Education. The college submitted the wrong data and
wasn’t able to correct it, he said in an e-mail. Tuition and
fees for 2009-2010 was $12,126 he said.  The average cost for for-profit, four-year schools was
$15,661 a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
