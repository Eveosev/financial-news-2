Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s
largest defense contractor, plans to eliminate about 1,500
employees from its Aeronautics business unit that makes F-35 jet
fighters, the company said today.  The job cuts will be spread across three major sites in
Texas, Georgia and  California , as well as six smaller plants in
several states, Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said in a
statement.  Salaried employees will be offered a voluntary retirement
option, the company said. If the goal of cutting 1,500 jobs is
not reached through that measure, the company will start firing
people starting in mid-September, Lockheed said.  “We expect the greatest impact to be on employees in
higher-level labor grades,” it said.  Since Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  signaled a slowdown in
U.S. defense spending in 2009, Lockheed has announced about
2,500 job cuts. Those include 1,200 positions at the space unit
announced in June; 300 jobs cut in May at a Greenville,  South
Carolina , plant; voluntary retirement of 600 senior executives
in September 2010, resulting in a charge of $178 million; and
250 jobs eliminated in November at a plant in Eagan, Minnesota,
that made the P-3 surveillance plane.  The company said it employs 126,000 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
