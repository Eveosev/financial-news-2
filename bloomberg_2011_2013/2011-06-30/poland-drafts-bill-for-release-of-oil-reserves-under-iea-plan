Poland’s Economy Ministry drafted a
law allowing  oil companies  to sell 130,000 metric tons of oil
equivalent under the  International Energy Agency ’s inventory-
release program.  “The law will allow oil refiners and trading companies to
reduce their reserves,” the ministry said in a statement today.  The IEA, adviser to countries including the U.S. and the
U.K., is coordinating the release of 60 million barrels of crude
and oil products to markets from the end of this week.  Poland is one of 12 countries participating. More than half
of the reserves to be released by the country, equal to about
959,000 barrels, will be in diesel fuel, according to the IEA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
