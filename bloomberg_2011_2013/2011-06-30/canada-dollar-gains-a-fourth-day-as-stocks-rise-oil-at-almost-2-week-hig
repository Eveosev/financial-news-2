Canada ’s dollar appreciated for a
fourth straight day in the longest winning streak since April as
global stocks gained and crude oil, the nation’s largest export,
traded at almost a two-week high.  The loonie, as the currency is also known, touched the
strongest level versus the U.S. dollar in almost seven weeks
after Greek lawmakers approved a second bill on an austerity
plan to head off a default. Government data yesterday showed
consumer prices in Canada rose last month at the fastest since
2003. The currency stayed higher today after another report
showed economic growth in April beat forecasts it would shrink.  “Risk is back on today,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets unit in Toronto. “After the most recent CPI
number, we are going to see Canada continue to strengthen.”  The Canadian currency appreciated 0.6 percent to 96.34
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 96.95
cents yesterday. It touched 96.25 cents, the strongest level
since May 13. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0380.  “The 96.5 level in Canada terms is sticky,” said  Shane Enright , executive director at Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit in Toronto. “It was stuck
here several times on previous dips lower,” he said, referring
to drops in the greenback versus the loonie.  Bonds Fall  Government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark
10-year note up three basis points to 3.11 percent. It touched
3.14 percent, the highest since May 20. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. The price of the 3.25 percent security
maturing in June 2021 decreased 22 cents to C$101.20.  Canada will auction C$3.5 billion ($3.6 billion) of five-
year notes on July 6, according to a statement today on the Bank
of Canada’s website. The 2.75 percent securities mature in
September 2016.  Canada’s dollar advanced 0.5 percent on the month versus
its U.S. counterpart. It was up 0.8 percent on the quarter that
ended today and is 3.6 percent higher this year. The currency
rose yesterday by the most since December on an intraday basis
after the inflation report and as debt-strapped  Greece ’s
parliament approved the austerity plan.  The loonie extended gains today versus the greenback after
Greek lawmakers voted 155-136 to implement the 78 billion-euro
($113 billion) package of budget cuts and state asset sales, a
key to receiving further international financial aid.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1 percent in its
fourth daily gain. Crude oil for August delivery gained 0.4
percent to $95.10 a barrel in  New York  after reaching $95.84
yesterday, the highest level since June 15.  ‘Down the Road’  “Financial European issues were pushed down the road,”
said Firas Askari, head currency trader in Toronto at Bank of
Montreal’s BMO Capital unit. “The Australian dollar and the
loonie are benefiting.”  Australia ’s dollar gained 0.4 percent to $1.0722 after
touching $1.0751, the strongest level since June 7. The Aussie
slipped 0.2 percent versus the Canadian currency to C$1.0329.  Canada’s economy stalled in April as automobile production
was disrupted by natural disasters in  Japan , data showed. Output
in the world’s 11th largest economy was little changed at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of C$1.26 trillion ($1.31
trillion),  Statistics Canada  said. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast GDP contracted 0.1 percent.  The economy grew 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the data
showed, compared with a revised 2.9 percent gain in April 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
