Gasoline stockpiles in independent
storage in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp,  Europe ’s oil-trading
hub, fell for the first time in three weeks, according to PJK
International BV.  Gasoline inventories fell 2 percent to 703,000 metric tons
in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher based in
the Netherlands. Cargoes were shipped to Mexico, Nigeria and the
U.S. while the motor fuel arrived from Denmark,  France , Italy,
Spain,  Sweden  and the U.K.  “There’s reasonable demand because of the season,” Pieter Kulsen, founder of PJK, said today by phone from Oosterhout
where the company is based. “Product is also moving by barge to
Germany, France and Switzerland.”  Naphtha stores climbed 61 percent to 106,000 tons on
volumes from Russia, PJK data show. That’s the highest level
since mid-April 2010.  Gasoil stockpiles increased 0.3 percent to 2.81 million
tons on imports from  Argentina ,  Russia , Sweden, the U.K. and the
U.S., PJK data show. Cargoes of the fuel, which includes heating
oil and diesel, were exported to the Suez and West Africa.  Fuel oil  stocks gained 6 percent to 748,000 tons on cargoes
from  Brazil ,  Colombia , Finland, France, Lithuania and Russia,
according to PJK.  Jet fuel increased 10 percent to 432,000 tons on imports
