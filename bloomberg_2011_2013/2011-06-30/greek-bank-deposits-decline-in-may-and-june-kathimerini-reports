Deposits at  Greece â€™s banks
contracted by 10 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in May and June
amid speculation the country might default on its debt,
 Kathimerini  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Much of the outflow appears to be going to banks in Cyprus,
where deposits increased by 2.1 billion euros in May, the
Athens-based newspaper reported.  The rate of contraction has declined in the past few days,
Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
