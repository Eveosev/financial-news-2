The U.S. Transportation Department
said it ordered a Georgia bus company to shut down after an
audit turned up “a continuing and flagrant disregard” for
passenger safety.  H & W Tour Inc. was declared an “imminent hazard to public
safety” after Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
inspectors found it operating without authority, without
required levels of insurance and without an adequate drug- and
alcohol-testing program, the agency said in a statement today.  To contact the reporters on this story: Jeff Plungis in
