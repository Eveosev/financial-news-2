Serbiaâ€™s capital may get a 57
million-euro ($82.6 million) loan from  the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development  to build tram tracks and roads.  The loan, which is awaiting approval by the EBRD board,
would help improve public transportation while reducing traffic
and pollution, the London-based bank said today on its  website .
Part of the loan would be used to lay tram tracks on a new
bridge across the Sava River.  To contact the reporter on this story:
