Sony Corp. (SNE) , Samsung Techwin Co. and
 Robert Bosch GmbH  were named in a U.S. trade complaint filed by
closely held ObjectVideo Inc., alleging infringement of patents
for video analytics software.  ObjectVideo claims the companies violate its intellectual
property rights and seeks to block imports of their video
products, according to a  notice  posted on the U.S. International
Trade Commission’s website. A copy of the complaint wasn’t
immediately available. The Washington-based agency can block
imports of products that infringe U.S. patents.  ObjectVideo -- a Reston, Virginia-based company that makes
software used in security, business intelligence and public
safety -- filed a civil lawsuit in April against the companies
in a Richmond, Virginia, federal court. The lawsuit claims
infringement of patents related to virtual tripwires, which can
trigger notifications to the user of the software.  Samsung Techwin, based in Changwon,  South Korea , is that
country’s biggest digital-camera maker. Stuttgart, Germany-based
Robert Bosch is the world’s largest maker of auto parts. Tokyo-
based Sony’s businesses include video-game systems,
communication devices and  information technology .  The ITC case is Certain Video Analytics Software,
Components Thereof and Products Containing the Same, Complaint
No. 2826, U.S. International Trade Commission ( Washington ).  The civil suit is ObjectVideo Inc. v. Robert Bosch GmbH,
11cv217, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Richmond).  To contact the reporter on this story:
