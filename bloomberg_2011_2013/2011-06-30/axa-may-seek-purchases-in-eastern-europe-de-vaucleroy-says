Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-largest
insurer, aims to reach operating earnings “as close as
possible” to 100 million euros ($145 million) from eastern and
central European countries, said Jacques de Vaucleroy, who
oversees the company’s operations there.  Axa last year generated 1 million euros of operating profit
from a group of countries including the  Czech Republic , Poland 
and Ukraine, according to a presentation handed to reporters 
today.  “It would be an issue if we are still in the same position
five years from now,” de Vaucleroy told reporters, without
giving a timeframe for the target. ”We would like, if there is
something available, to make acquisitions in the region,” he
said, declining to identify any specific target.  Axa may also look for acquisitions in  Turkey , Chief
Executive Officer Henri de Castries said in a separate
presentation to reporters.  De Castries said Axa supports a ”long-term” solution to
roll over Greek debt and hopes that non-European and smaller
bondholders will also participate.  Axa holds about 300 million euros in Greek sovereign debt.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
