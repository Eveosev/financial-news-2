Arcadis NV (ARCAD) , the largest Dutch
designer of bridges and dikes, said it raised $573 million
through bonds and loans to refinance debt.  Arcadis sold $110 million of 10-year 5.1 percent bonds to
five U.S. investors in its first private placement, and took
$245 million of term loans maturing in 2013 and 2016, the
Amsterdam-based company said today in a statement. It also
obtained 150 million euros ($218 million) in a five-year  credit
line .  The term loans will cost Arcadis about 3.5 percent after
it hedging arrangements, Chief Financial Officer Renier Vree
said by phone today.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and ING Groep NV managed
the private placement while Rabobank International coordinated
the bank loans, Arcadis said.  The deal will “extend the maturity profile” of Arcadis’s
borrowings and provides “sufficient” financing to meet its
targets “over the next few years,” Vree said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
