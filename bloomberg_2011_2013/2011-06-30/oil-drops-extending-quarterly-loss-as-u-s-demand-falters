Oil dropped, extending its first
quarterly loss in a year, amid signs of faltering fuel demand in
the U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures in  New York  dropped as much as 0.7 percent, halting
the biggest two-day rally in seven weeks. The U.S. Energy
Department said yesterday gasoline demand dropped for a second
week in the seven days to June 24. U.S. pump prices are up 29
percent from a year earlier.  “The situation with very high gasoline prices isn’t
sustainable,”  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at
Credit Agricole SA, said by phone. “The Energy Department
figures weren’t that supportive.”  Crude for August delivery fell as much as 62 cents to
$94.15 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $94.57 as of 9:57 a.m. London time. The
contract climbed yesterday $1.88 to $94.77, completing a two-day
gain of 4.6 percent, the most since May 10. Futures are down 11
percent this quarter.  Brent oil for August settlement was down $1.10 a barrel at
$111.30. The European benchmark, down 5.2 percent in the second
quarter, traded at a premium of $16.83 to New York-traded West
Texas Intermediate. The spread reached a record $22.29 a barrel
on June 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
