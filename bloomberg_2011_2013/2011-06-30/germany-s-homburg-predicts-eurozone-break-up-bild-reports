(Corrects costs estimate in second paragraph.)  Stefan Homburg, a public finance
professor at Hanover University, predicts that  Greece  won’t be
able to pay back its debt and the result will be a breakup of
the eurozone, Bild-Zeitung  reported , citing an interview.  The euro rescue package sets wrong incentives and it’s only
a matter of time before strong countries drop the common
currency, the newspaper cited Homburg as saying. Leaving the
eurozone now would cost  Germany  a low three-digit-billion euro
amount, while contributing to further financial aid would be
much more expensive, according to Homburg, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
