The U.K.’s National Audit Office
will get new powers to go over Queen Elizabeth II’s accounts, as
part of legislation to simplify allowances to members of the
royal family.  Since 1760, when King George III gave up the income from
his estates in exchange for an allowance, British royals have
lived off the “civil list,” paid to the monarch and some of
her family. That, as well as two other regular payments, will be
combined into a single Sovereign Grant under a bill published by
the Treasury today.  The bill also introduces new scrutiny of royal expenses.
The NAO will now report on the accounts to Parliament, allowing
lawmakers, including the Public Accounts Committee, to hold
hearings on spending. That means royal travel and dining could
be publicly scrutinized.  To contact the reporters on this story:
