Sugar may fall next week as traders
expect global supplies to outpace demand in the season that
begins on Oct. 1.  Seven of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said raw sugar in  New York  may decline. Two said
it would gain, and two expect little change. Before today,
futures for October delivery gained 1.3 percent this week to
26.34 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. The price fell 2.8
percent in the second quarter.  Seven of 11 respondents said refined sugar on London’s NYSE
Liffe will drop. Two said it would gain, and two were neutral.
Futures for August delivery advanced 0.6 percent this week
through yesterday.  Three respondents said refined sugar’s premium over raw may
widen, four said it would narrow and four people were neutral.  To contact the reporters on this story:
