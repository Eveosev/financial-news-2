Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said
services industries, including education and finance, would grow
by around one third and mining will continue to expand as the
country adopts a carbon price.  “It’s a story of services sector output, in industries
like education, health, finance, professional services,
information and communication technology, recreation, retail and
wholesale -- increasing by around a third in the next decade,”
Swan said in a speech to the Economy Outlook conference in
 Melbourne . “It’s a story of mining and construction output
growing at a real annual rate of around 6 percent and 4 percent,
respectively, to 2020.”  Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  is seeking to garner support
for an emissions trading system in the world’s biggest coal
exporter, where the number of Australians who say the nation
should take action has slipped to a record low in opinion polls.  To pass the plan through parliament, she needs the
agreement of independent lawmakers and the Greens Party. A
report is scheduled in coming days from the Multiparty Climate
Change Committee of lawmakers on proposed legislation to go to
parliament in the next three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
