India  may make a proposed 26 percent
profit-sharing clause for mining companies flexible, allowing
concessions on genuine grounds, Mines Secretary S. Vijay Kumar
said.  “There seems to be a thinking in that direction,” Kumar
said by telephone today. “We cannot put all mining companies in
the same bracket.” He declined to elaborate.  India proposes to replace the more-than-five-decade-old
Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act and include a
clause requiring miners to share 26 percent of their profits
with the local people. Companies say the provision will deter
investors.  “Profit sharing is intended to enhance the lives of the
local population,” said  Rahul Jain , an analyst with RBS
Equities India Ltd. in Mumbai. “However, the interests of the
industry should also be kept in mind.”  A panel of ministers is scheduled to discuss the draft bill
on July 7. The cabinet will consider it and it will need to be
cleared by parliament to become law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
