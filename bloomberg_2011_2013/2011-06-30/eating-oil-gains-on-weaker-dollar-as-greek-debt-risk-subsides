Gasoline gained as optimism that the
Greek debt crisis will subside weakened the dollar, increasing
the investment appeal of commodities.  Futures advanced a fourth day as the U.S. currency lost 0.6
percent versus the euro at 2:54 p.m. in  New York  after Greek
lawmakers authorized an austerity plan to draw more
international monetary aid. A measure of U.S. business activity
improved and  consumer confidence  reached a 10-week high,
indicating better fuel demand for the July 4 holiday weekend.  “The alarm on  Greece  has subsided and we’re getting some
decent economic numbers,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “We’re getting some good
follow-through from yesterday’s gains, particularly for gasoline
ahead of the holiday weekend.”  Gasoline for July delivery rose 2.19 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $3.0316 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , a two-week high. July gasoline and heating
futures expired today. Prices sank 3.8 percent this month and
2.4 percent in the quarter.  The more actively traded August contract added 3.43 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to settle at $2.9692.  “It’s the end of the month, the end of quarter, a lot of
people are going to be out of town tomorrow and people typically
don’t want to be short going into a holiday weekend,” said Mark
Anderle, a trader at Truman Arnold Cos., a wholesaler in
Texarkana,  Texas .  Euro-area finance ministers are set to approve the next aid
payment for Greece and outline a second rescue after banks lined
up behind debt-rollover plans and Greek lawmakers approved a
budget-cutting package.  ISM- Chicago   The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today
its business barometer rose to 61.1 in June from 56.6 a month
earlier. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index increased to minus
43.9 for the period ended June 26 after dropping to minus 44.9
the prior week.  The Energy Department reported yesterday that U.S. gasoline
supplies fell unexpectedly last week and imports sank to the
lowest level in 15 weeks.  “The inventory draw was bullish,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago.  Regular gasoline at the pump fell 0.2 cent to $3.541 a
gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  Heating oil for July delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $2.9327 a gallon on the exchange. The more
actively traded August contract rose 1.16 cents to $2.9463.  Prices dipped 4 percent this month and 5.1 percent in the
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
