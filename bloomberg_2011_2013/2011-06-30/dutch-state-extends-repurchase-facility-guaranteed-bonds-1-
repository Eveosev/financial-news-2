The Netherlands said a temporary
facility for banks to repurchase state-guaranteed bonds will be
kept open permanently after two banks repurchased more than 3
billion euros ($4.4 billion) of debt since February.  “The facility has been successful and I am planning to
keep it open on a permanent basis,” Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said in a letter sent today to parliament. The
guarantees cover 34.2 billion of debt as of June 30, according
to the letter.  Banking units of Dutch firms such as NIBC Bank NV,  SNS
Reaal NV (SR) ,  ABN Amro  Group NV and  ING Groep NV (INGA)  sold more than 50
billion euros of debt backed by the government. The guarantees,
aimed to restore funding to lenders during the financial crisis,
were put in place in 2008.  ABN Amro on April 15 offered to repurchase as much as 3
billion euros of notes due in April 2012, which were sold by
Fortis Bank Nederland Holding NV in 2009. ABN Amro has 9 billion
euros of outstanding government-guaranteed debt. NIBC Holding
NV’s banking unit, which borrowed about 6 billion euros under
the program, has bought back 491 million euros of the bonds
ahead of schedule.  The close-out fee remains unchanged at 15 percent and can
be adjusted if necessary, according to the minister’s letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
