Former top-ranked player Ana Ivanovic hired Nigel Sears, the head coach of women’s tennis at
the U.K.’s Lawn Tennis Association, after dropping to No. 18 in
the world rankings.  Sears will coach Ivanovic, who won the French Open in 2008,
on a full-time basis after quitting his LTA position. In the
Wimbledon championships currently taking place, the 23-year-old
Serb lost to Petra Cetkovska of the  Czech Republic  in the third
round.  “I couldn’t be happier,” Ivanovic said on  her website .
“I’ve admired Nigel for some time now, and I can’t wait to
start working with him on court. It was important that I waited
for the right coach, and we are both excited about the
challenges ahead.”  During Sears’s 4 1/2 years in the LTA post, five British
women entered the world’s top 100, two reached the top 50, and
two girls won Junior Grand Slam titles, the ruling body said.  “It’s been a real privilege to be in charge of women’s
tennis at the LTA, and an honor to captain  Great Britain ’s Fed
Cup team, and I feel we’ve made considerable progress in the
women’s game over this period,” Sears said in an  LTA statement .  To contact the reporter on this story:
