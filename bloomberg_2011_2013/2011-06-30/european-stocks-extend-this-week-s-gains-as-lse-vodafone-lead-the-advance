European stocks rose, extending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s biggest rally in three months. Asian
stocks and U.S. futures also advanced.  London  Stock Exchange Group Plc climbed 3.6 percent after
the U.K. bourse scrapped its bid for TMX Group Inc. and UBS AG
said the company may now be a takeover target.  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD)  increased 0.9 percent after saying it could get an annual
dividend of as much as $5.5 billion from its stake in Verizon
Wireless.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to 270.53 at
8:03 a.m. in London, extending yesterday’s 1.7 percent advance,
the biggest gain since March 21, after Greek lawmakers approved
a package of austerity measures to help secure financial aid.
The gauge has lost 2.9 percent this quarter, its largest decline
in a year, on concern that  Greece  will fail to repay all its
debt.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
