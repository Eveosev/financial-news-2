Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  sold
an office building at 1107 Broadway in Manhattan for
$190.8 million, according to an e-mail sent to the defunct
firm’s chief executive officer,  Bryan Marsal .  Steven Witkoff, chairman and CEO of New York-based Witkoff
Group, was the buyer, Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman,
said in a separate e-mail today. Other bidders included  Harry Macklowe  and  SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) , according to the e-mail sent
yesterday to Marsal.  The price for the building, once part of the former
International Toy Center, rose at a two-hour auction in
Manhattan yesterday from a starting bid of $161.5 million from
L&L Holding Co., Anthony Barsanti, who runs Lehman’s real-estate
team, wrote in the e-mail to Marsal. Net proceeds to Lehman will
be about $155 million, according to the e-mail.  Lehman earlier this month won a judge’s approval to sell
the building for about $160 million. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said he “endorsed” the decision by Lehman and its
creditors’ committee to “monetize an asset.”  Marsal, the co-founder of restructuring firm Alvarez &
Marsal LLC, aims to raise $65 billion by selling Lehman’s
assets, including real estate that it values at $13.2 billion.
Lehman raised $3 billion through March from real estate sales,
according to the company’s liquidation plan filed yesterday.  Closely held L&L, founded in 2000, acquires and develops
Manhattan office buildings, according to its  website . L&L
Chairman David W. Levinson is the former vice chairman of  CB
Richard Ellis Group Inc. (CBG)   The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
