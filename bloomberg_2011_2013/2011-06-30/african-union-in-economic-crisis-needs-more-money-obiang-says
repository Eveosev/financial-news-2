The  African Union  faces an economic
crisis and its 53 member states must contribute more to the
running of the body, Equatorial Guinea’s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo said.  African members must make their contributions so the group
doesn’t need to seek outside funding, Obiang said today during
the opening of an AU summit that he is hosting in his country’s
capital, Malabo.  “Our organization is suffering an economic crisis,” he
said. “Africa is a rich continent and we must find a solution
so we do not depend on an intervention from outsiders” to
support the AU’s finances.  Libya, Algeria, Nigeria, Egypt and South Africa together
pay for 75 percent of the Addis Ababa-based organization’s
running costs, according the AU.  Libya  hasn’t paid its
contributions for two years, AU Commission head Jean Ping told
reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
