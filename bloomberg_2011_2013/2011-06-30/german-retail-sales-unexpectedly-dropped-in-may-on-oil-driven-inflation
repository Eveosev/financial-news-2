German retail sales unexpectedly
fell in May as oil-driven inflation sapped household incomes.  Sales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, fell 2.8
percent from April, when they stagnated, the Federal Statistics
Office in Wiesbaden said today. Economists forecast a gain of
0.5 percent, the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey showed. Sales rose 2.2 percent in the year.  “Oil and gasoline prices were still quite high in May and
that may have kept people from spending,” said Christian Schulz, an economist at Joh. Berenberg Gossler & Co. in  London .
“At the same time, Germany is booming and the overall trend is
for stronger  consumer spending .”  Increasing export orders from Asia have prompted German
companies to step up hiring, sending unemployment to the lowest
in two decades. While Germany’s Bundesbank earlier this month
raised its 2011 growth forecast, rising energy costs are leaving
households with less money to spend.  While crude  oil prices  have retreated over the past month,
they’re still up 26 percent from a year earlier. Germany’s
inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European Union
method, held at 2.4 percent in June. That’s above the  European
Central Bank ’s 2 percent limit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
