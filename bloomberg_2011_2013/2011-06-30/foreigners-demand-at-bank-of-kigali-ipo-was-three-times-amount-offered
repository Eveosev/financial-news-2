Demand from foreign investors for
shares in an initial public offer by Bank of Kigali Ltd.,
 Rwanda ’s biggest lender by assets, was three times the amount
offered, said Chief Operating Officer Lawson Naibo.  The bank offered 40 percent of total shares to people
outside the East African nation in a sale that ended June 23, he
said in an interview in Kigali, the capital, today. Demand from
the offer within the country, which starts today, “will be the
same,” he said.  Rwanda doubled the size of its economy in the nine years to
2010 as it recovers from a genocide in which 800,000 mainly
ethnic Tutsis died in 1994. The government is selling assets to
private investors as it seeks to attract more foreign investors.
Rwanda is growing its “financial sector by building our stock
exchange,” said Finance Minister John Rwangombwa in a speech in
Kigali.  Bank of Kigali plans to raise 37.5 billion Rwandan francs
($62.2 million) in the sale of 300 million shares that closes
July 29, African Alliance Rwanda, which is leading the offer,
said yesterday.  The lender opened five new branches across the country
today, bringing it to a total of 38 locations, said Managing
Director James Gatera. It aims to have 85 branches in five
years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
