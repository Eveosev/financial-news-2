Mexico reduced its  gold reserves  by
0.18 metric ton in May after boosting holdings the previous
three months, according to International Monetary Fund data.  Mexico’s reserves declined to 105.95 tons last month, data
on the IMF’s website showed. It had expanded holdings by almost
100 tons in the three months through April, with the increase
valued at about $4.8 billion at today’s price. Russia’s central
bank boosted its gold holdings to about 26.7 million ounces
(830.5 tons) last month, from 26.5 million ounces in April, Bank
Rossii said on June 20.  “It was surprising to read that Mexico sold some gold,
they seem to actively manage their reserves,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt . “We
think central banks will continue to buy gold and diversify
their reserves and this should be true especially for the
emerging market central banks. Generally, gold buying by central
banks should be supportive of the gold price.”  Central banks are expanding their gold reserves for the
first time in a generation as purchases by billionaire investors
including  John Paulson  contributed to bullion extending its
longest winning streak since at least 1920. The metal is trading
4.3 percent below a record $1,577.57 an ounce set May 2.  Bullion traded at $1,510.12 by 11:51 a.m. in  London  and is
up 6.3 percent this year. It’s heading for an 11th straight
quarterly gain. Global holdings of gold by governments and
official institutions such as the IMF stood at 30,684.2 tons by
this month, according to the World Gold Council.  Bank Purchases Rise  Central banks will be net buyers of gold this year and
probably next year, Marcus Grubb, managing director of
investment at the producer-funded council, said on June 16. They
bought 129 tons this year through April, exceeding last year’s
total of 90 tons, Grubb said then.  Since the end of 2009, countries including India,  Sri
Lanka , Mauritius and Bangladesh have bought gold. Bullion
accounted for 4 percent of Mexico’s total reserves, and 7.8
percent of Russia’s, according to the latest World Gold Council
holdings report. The metal accounts for more than 70 percent of
reserves of the U.S. and  Germany , the biggest holders, the
council’s data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
