Investment banking  may generate a
smaller share of banks’ earnings as greater regulation erodes
profitability and returns from commercial and consumer lending
increase,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Investment banks may shift capital to activities such as
treasury services for companies and trade finance at the expense
of sales and trading, the ratings company said in a report
today. The growth of retail businesses in  Asia  and  Latin America 
may also help fuel earnings, S&P said.  “We may be looking at the beginning of the end of
investment banking’s pre-eminence in the world’s biggest global
banks,” S&P said. “The opportunistic profits from the wide
bid-ask spreads of the transition period of 2009 to 2010 appear
to be gone.”  After reporting record investment-banking and trading
revenue for 2009, Wall Street banks have had declines in those
businesses for four straight quarters compared with year-earlier
periods. A fall in fixed-income trading revenue, the biggest
capital-markets business for the banks, largely spurred the
decreases.  “In our opinion, investment banking has harvested the
bumper crops of the transition period,” S&P wrote in its
report. “Stable client-centered commercial businesses such as
treasury services and trade finance may become the favored
son.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
