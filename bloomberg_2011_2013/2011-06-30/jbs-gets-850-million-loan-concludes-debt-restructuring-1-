JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said its U.S. unit received an $850 million  bank loan ,
bringing to $2.06 billion the total amount it has raised in two
months to restructure debt.  Interest on the five-year asset-based loan is 175 basis
points, or 1.75 percentage points, above the London interbank
offered rate, known as Libor, Sao Paulo-based JBS said today in
a regulatory filing.  The company’s restructuring plan “reached $2 billion at a
considerably lower cost than expected,” Investor Relations
Director Jerry O’Callaghan said in the statement.  In May, JBS said it’s U.S. unit sold $650 million of 10-
year bonds and received a seven-year term loan of $475 million.
The company, which has raised a total of $2.06 billion through
JBS USA LLC at an average cost of 4.35 percent, said the
restructuring will save about $150 million a year.  JBS shares rose 7 centavos, or 1.3 percent, to 5.30 reais
at 4:34 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  trading. The stock has lost 30 percent
in the past year, compared with a 2.1 percent gain for  Brazil ’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
