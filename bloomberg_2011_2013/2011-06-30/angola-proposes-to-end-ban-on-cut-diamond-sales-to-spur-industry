Angola ’s government proposes to end
a ban on local sales of cut diamonds as it seeks to encourage
investors to set up gem-polishing factories in the country.  “Trade in polished diamonds in the domestic market is free
subject to conditions and formalities which safeguard the market
stability and safety of transactions,” according to a proposed
law submitted by the industry and mines ministry to parliament.  Angola is  Africa ’s fourth-biggest diamond producer after
Botswana, the Democratic Republic of Congo and  South Africa ,
according to the  U.S. Geological Survey . The country also plans
to end curbs on setting up polishing plants and jewelry stores,
according to a copy of the legislation.  Sales of “high volumes” of cut diamonds will be carried
out exclusively by polishing factories, while retailing of gems
polished locally will be done through jewelry stores, it said.  The nation in March ended a policy of giving 51 percent
stakes in all concessions on kimberlites, rock formations that
may hold diamonds, to state-run Endiama EP. The company will now
take a stake of not less than 10 percent in the developments.  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos will approve all
diamond investments of $25 million or more, and smaller projects
will be granted by the ministry, according to the proposed law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
