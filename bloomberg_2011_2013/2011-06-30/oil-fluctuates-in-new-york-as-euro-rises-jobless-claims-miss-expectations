Oil rose to the highest level in two
weeks in  New York , recouping all of the losses since the
 International Energy Agency  said June 23 that members would tap
emergency reserves.  Oil gained 0.7 percent as the euro climbed to the highest
level in almost three weeks against the U.S. currency after
Greek lawmakers backed a plan to resolve the debt crisis,
boosting the appeal of dollar-priced commodities. The quarterly
decline of 11 percent was the worst performance since 2008.  “The surprise of the IEA release has been factored in and
we’ve moved beyond it,” said  Peter Beutel , president of Cameron
Hanover Inc., an energy-advisory company in  New Canaan ,
Connecticut. “We have since been responding to things that have
happened with  Greece  and the dollar.”  Crude for August delivery rose 65 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$95.42 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , 1 cent above the
settlement price on June 22, the day before the IEA
announcement. Prices have risen 4.4 percent this year and 26
percent in the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement rose 8 cents to $112.48 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark, which fell 4.2 percent in the second
quarter, traded at a premium of $17.06 to New York-traded West
Texas Intermediate. The spread reached a record $22.29 a barrel
on June 15.  The IEA said June 23 that its members would release 60
million barrels of oil from strategic reserves over 30 days
beginning at the end of this week to make up for a Libyan
production shortfall and curb high prices. Half the crude will
come from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  Euro Strengthens  The euro gained 0.5 percent to $1.4417 at 3:50 p.m. in New
York. Earlier, it touched $1.4538, the highest level since June
10, on prospects the  European Central Bank  will increase
 interest rates  next week to reduce inflation and as the risk of
an immediate Greek debt default subsides.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won approval of a
second bill to authorize his 78 billion-euro ($113 billion)
package of budget cuts and asset sales, a key to receiving
further international aid.  “The dollar is weaker, which has supported oil,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. in New
York.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.8 percent to
1,317.76 at 3:11 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 125.75 points, or 1 percent, to 12,387.17.  Jobless Claims  Earlier, futures retreated 0.9 percent after the Labor
Department reported that jobless claims fell less than expected
in the week ended June 25 and after crude failed to breach
technical resistance at the 200-day moving average.  August oil faces resistance at about $96.05, the 200-day
moving average, and $96.20, the middle of a Bollinger chart,
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut .  “Markets are thin and easily moved as people are shutting
down for the long weekend,” he said. U.S. financial markets
will be closed July 4 for the Independence Day holiday.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 472,834
contracts as of 3:13 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 639,491
contracts yesterday, 15 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.53 million contracts.  New York futures capped their biggest two-day rally in
seven weeks yesterday after the U.S. Energy Department said
supplies dropped almost three times as much as forecast last
week. Stockpiles fell 4.38 million barrels to 359.5 million.  OPEC Production  The  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’  crude
output rose for a third straight month in June as  Saudi Arabia 
boosted production by 3.2 percent to a 32-month high, a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Total OPEC output increased by 210,000 barrels, or 0.7
percent, to average 29.105 million barrels a day, the highest
level since February, according to the survey of oil companies,
producers and analysts. Daily output by the 11 members with
quotas, all except  Iraq , climbed 180,000 barrels to 26.4
million, 1.555 million barrels above their target.  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, produced 9.21
million barrels a day in June, the highest level since October
2008 and an increase of 285,000 from May. Nigeria, Iraq and
Kuwait also boosted production, while the other members cut
output or left it unchanged from May, the survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
