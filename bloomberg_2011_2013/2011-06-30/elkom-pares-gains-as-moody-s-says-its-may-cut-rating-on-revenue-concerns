Telkom South  Africa  Ltd., Africa’s
largest fixed-line phone operator, was placed on a review for
possible credit-rating downgrade by Moody’s Investor Service,
citing concern about revenue losses and competition.  “Telkom operations, strategies and market image has
furthermore been impacted by a series of management changes in
the past two years,” Soummo Mukherjee, vice president and
senior analyst at Moody’s, said in an e-mailed statement.  Moody’s has a Baa1 rating on the company, the third-lowest
investment grade bond. Telkom has three bonds outstanding,
totaling 4.7 billion rand ($695.6 million), due between 2012 and
2020.  Since the company’s last downgrade in 2009, Telkom has
suffered “more than originally anticipated” from its money-
losing investment in Nigeria’s Multi-Links Communications Ltd.,
said Mukherjee.  Telkom bought the business in 2007, and invested a total
9.8 billion rand in the ensuing period, said Nombulelo Moholi,
Telkom’s chief executive officer, in a June 13 interview. On
June 28 the company announced an agreement to sell Multi-Links
to Helios Towers  Nigeria  for $10 million.  Multi-Links was the subject of a $252 million liability
claim at the high court of Lagos, Nigeria’s capital, by Helios,
on a disputed lease agreement.  The company’s 11.9 percent bond due 2016 fell marginally to
107.498 rand, taking the yield to 9.5 percent, and extending
yesterday’s 3.2 percent loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
