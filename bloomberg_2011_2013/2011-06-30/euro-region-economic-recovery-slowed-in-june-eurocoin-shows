The economic recovery in the euro
region slowed in June, the  Eurocoin index  showed.  The index measuring economic expansion in the 17-nation
region fell to 0.52 percent from 0.62 percent in May, the
London-based  Centre for Economic Policy Research  and the  Bank of
Italy , which co-produce the index, said in an e-mailed report
today.  “While most of the indicator’s components showed
slowdowns, the fall in Eurocoin mainly reflected the performance
of share prices and the results of business opinion surveys,”
the report said.  European shares have fallen almost 5 percent since the
start of May as policy makers failed to stem rising expectations
of a Greek default that may spread contagion through the region.
In Germany investor confidence dropped this month, a report
showed on June 21, highlighting the risk that the euro-area
economy may falter after expanding at the fastest pace in almost
a year in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
