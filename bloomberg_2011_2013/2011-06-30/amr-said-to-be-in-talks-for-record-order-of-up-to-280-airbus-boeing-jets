AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American Airlines  is
discussing an order of as many as 280 new narrow-body jets, a
deal that may set an industry record, in talks with Airbus SAS
and  Boeing Co. (BA) , two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The negotiations involve a purchase in a range of 250 to
280 planes, said the people, who asked not to be identified
because details are private. Bloomberg News reported last week
that American was studying whether to buy at least 100 Airbus
jets in a shift from the airline’s longtime reliance on Boeing.  Buying 280 planes would be a transaction of at least $22.6
billion at list prices, based on the $80.8 million  retail value 
of the Boeing 737-800, which costs less than the Airbus A320 or
the upgraded A320neo. Airlines pay discounted prices.  An American order would bolster Toulouse, France-based
Airbus’s quest to persuade a Boeing-only airline to defect.
Keeping the third-largest U.S. airline is important for Boeing
because the Chicago-based planemaker can’t afford to lose
customers while deciding on a successor to the 737, the world’s
most widely flown jetliner.  AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA)  set the mark for the largest single plane
purchase with an agreement last week at the  Paris Air Show  to
buy 200 A320neos. The Malaysian airline’s deal topped a contract
from  India ’s IndiGo for 180 Airbus jets.  AMR’s board may decide on new planes as soon as next month,
people familiar with the matter said last week.  Andy Backover, a spokesman for  Fort Worth , Texas-based
American, declined to comment, as did Boeing’s Marc Birtel in
Seattle and Airbus’s Mary Anne Greczyn in Herndon, Virginia.  Boeing’s View  “We’re having good conversation” with American, Marlin Dailey, Boeing’s sales chief, said last week in an interview at
the Paris show, while declining to elaborate. “We’re making
good progress. We’re optimistic that it’ll play out well.”  American’s main jet fleet of 613 planes now consists only
of Boeings, after its last Airbus aircraft, the twin-aisle A300,
went out of active service in 2009.  The airline said its most-common plane type is the Boeing
MD-80, with 216. A workhorse on American’s domestic routes, the
MD-80 went out of production in 1999 and is being phased out of
the carrier’s fleet in favor of 737-800s, which are 25 percent
more fuel efficient.  American began receiving deliveries in 2009 on an order of
130 737-800s that will be completed by 2013.  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that American’s
talks on a plane order would be for 250 jets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
