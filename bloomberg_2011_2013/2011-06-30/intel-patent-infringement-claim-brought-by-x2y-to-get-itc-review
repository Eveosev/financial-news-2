A U.S. trade agency agreed to
investigate claims that  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the world’s largest
chipmaker, is infringing a Pennsylvania company’s patents on
ways to improve how power is delivered to an electronic circuit.  X2Y Attenuators LLC  filed the  complaint  with the U.S.
International Trade Commission on May 31, and the Washington-
based agency  said  today it would review the claims. Closely held
X2Y is seeking to block imports of Intel chips including the
high-end desktop Core i7 chip, as well as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  computers that run on the processor.  The inventions covered by the five patents are designed to
overcome electromagnetic interference, which can damage
electronics, according to the ITC complaint. Erie, Pennsylvania-
based X2Y said it has licensed its inventions for inclusion in
satellite radios, military aircraft and noise-canceling
headphones and filed the complaints after  Santa Clara ,
California-based Intel declined to pay royalties.  The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Microprocessors,
Components Thereof and Products Containing Same, 337-781, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington). The civil case is
X2Y Attenuators LLC v. Intel Corp., 11cv117, U.S. District Court
for the Western District of Pennsylvania (Erie).  To contact the reporter on this story:
