Malaysia ’s ringgit rose for a third
day, capping a ninth consecutive quarterly gain, as improving
sentiment toward emerging-market assets attracted global
investors to the nation’s debt.  Greek lawmakers passed budget-austerity measures yesterday
in the first step to win more financial aid from the European
Union and avert the region’s first sovereign default. Demand
rose at Malaysia’s government bond sales this week on
speculation foreign investors added to holdings.  “It’s a relief rally from  Greece ’s decision that is
supporting Asian currencies,” said D. Sivadass, foreign-
exchange forwards trader at EON Capital Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.

from stock markets, he said.  The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.0198 per dollar as of
4:05 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  from 3.0255 on March 31, according to

yesterday. It may reach 3 per dollar next week, Sivadass said.  Malaysia sold 2 billion ringgit ($662 million) of 20-year
local-currency bonds yesterday, with demand outstripping supply
by 2.52 times, versus 1.67 times at the previous sale in April
2010. The government also completed a $2 billion global bond
offering this week, receiving orders for more than $9 billion of
the Islamic notes.  Global funds held a  record  83 billion ringgit of  government
bonds  in April, up from 73.8 billion ringgit at the end of 2010,
according to data published by Bank Negara Malaysia. The central
bank will report their holdings for May later today.  Bonds Gain  Three-year notes gained this month, extending an advance
during the second quarter.  The yield on the 3.434 percent securities due August 2014
