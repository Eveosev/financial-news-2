U.S. corn inventories at the
beginning of this month were larger than analysts expected,
signaling demand may be slowing from livestock producers as
feed costs climb. Soybean and wheat stockpiles were also
bigger than predicted.  Corn inventories remaining from last year’s harvest
totaled 3.67 billion bushels as of June 1, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said in a quarterly report on grain stockpiles.
Twenty-five analysts in a Bloomberg News survey expected 3.29
billion, on average. Supplies were still down 15 percent from
4.31 billion bushels a year earlier, the USDA said.  Corn prices are up 89 percent in the past year on the
Chicago Board of Trade after adverse weather cut the 2010
harvest and demand surged from ethanol producers and livestock
farmers. The July contract touched a record $7.9975 a bushel
on June 10, spurring some livestock farmers to substitute
other grains for corn in feed rations.  Livestock “feeders were using cheaper wheat supplies or
other alternatives to replace corn,” said  Shawn McCambridge ,
the senior grain analyst for Prudential Bache Commodities LLC.
“Margins have tightened up, so we may be seeing some
liquidation take place in livestock.”  July corn was 56.75 cents more expensive than July wheat
yesterday, exchange data show.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $6.505 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have declined this month on concern that
 Greece ’s debt crisis will spread, curbing demand for
commodities. The U.S. is the world’s largest corn grower and
exporter.  Soybean stockpiles left over from last year’s harvest
totaled 619.1 million bushels as of June 1, up 8.4 percent
from 571.1 million a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts
expected inventories of 592 million bushels, on average.  Bigger-than-expected soybean inventories signal demand is
slowing for U.S. shipments, said  Dale Durchholz , a senior
market analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois . In
the four weeks ended June 16, export sales were down 57
percent from the same period a year earlier, USDA data show.  “Processing demand for beans is not going to be very
good,” Durchholz said. “We’re finding more competition in
 Asia , with more meal coming out of  India  and  South America .”  U.S. stockpiles of wheat, including all varieties,
totaled 861 million bushels as of June 1, down 12 percent from
976 million a year earlier, the USDA said. Analysts expected
823 million. About 1.425 billion bushels were in storage on
March 1.  Today’s USDA estimates are based on a survey of 700,000
farmers and 9,000 commercial grain facilities.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government
figures show. Wheat was fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporters on this story:
