Rural Electrification Corp.,  India ’s
state-controlled lender to power projects, hired four banks to
help it borrow as much as $300 million, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corp. will help arrange the five-year term
facility and market it to other lenders, the person said, asking
not to be identified as details are private.  Rural Electrification, based in  New Delhi , aims to raise
$2.5 billion from selling overseas bonds and loans in the year
ending March 31 as it expands its market share in India.  Asia ’s
third-biggest economy is targeting $400 billion of investment in
power projects between 2012 and 2017 as it adds utilities and
expands its transmission and distribution systems to end a 10
percent deficit during peak hours.  Rural Electrification plans to borrow $200 million with an
option to increase the loan to $300 million, the person said.
The company has the equivalent of $10.1 billion of bonds and
loans maturing before the end of 2025, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
