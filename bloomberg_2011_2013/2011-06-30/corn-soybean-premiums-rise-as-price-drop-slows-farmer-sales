Cash premiums for corn and soybeans
shipped in July to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to
Chicago futures as U.S. farmers withheld supplies after prices
slumped on a report that June 1 inventories were larger than
expected.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered next
month was 66 cents to 71 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 64 cents to 68 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis rose to 74 cents to 78
cents a bushel from 74 cents to 77 cents.  “The cash market is working just enough to source a few
bushels because farmers are done selling,” said Bryce Stremming, a risk consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in
Bloomington,  Illinois . “The cash market will determine the
value of corn and soybeans, and right now it’s saying supplies
are still a little tight.”  Corn futures for July delivery plunged 69 cents, or 9.9
percent, to $6.29 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price fell to $6.15, the lowest for the contract
since January 10.  Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 28 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $13.0625 a bushel after earlier touching $12.90, the
lowest for the contract since March 16.  Corn stockpiles as of June 1 were 3.67 billion bushels, 12
percent higher than the average estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey, the USDA said today. Soybean reserves were estimated at
619 million bushels, 4.6 percent more than forecast and above
year-earlier supplies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
