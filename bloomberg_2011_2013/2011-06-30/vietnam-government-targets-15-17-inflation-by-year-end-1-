The Vietnamese government is
targeting year-end inflation of 15 percent to 17 percent,
according to  a news item  posted on its website today, signaling
the country may not meet a target set earlier this month.  Vietnam  raised its inflation target to 15 percent from
11.75 percent on June 3. Consumer prices climbed 20.82 percent
this month from a year earlier, according to data released by
the General Statistics Office in Hanoi on June 24.  The government “pointed out shortcomings and weaknesses
that need to be overcome,” including the persistently high
level of inflation, stock market declines, and low growth in the
manufacturing sector, according to the news item.  Vietnam’s inflation rate is “intolerable,” the  World Bank 
said this month in a report that called for the continuation of
tough monetary policy measures until the figure is sustainably
less than 10 percent.  Policy makers have raised  interest rates  every month this
year through May and cut the national target for credit growth.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
