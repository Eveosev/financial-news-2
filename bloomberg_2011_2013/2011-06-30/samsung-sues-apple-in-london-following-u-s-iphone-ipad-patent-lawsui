Samsung Electronics Co., the world’s
largest maker of computer memory chips, sued  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in the
U.K. on the same day it filed a U.S. lawsuit alleging the
company’s iPhone and iPad devices infringe its patents.  The lawsuit, filed yesterday in the High Court in London,
joins another filed in federal court in Delaware and a June 28
complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington that seek to block imports of the Apple devices.  Litigation between the companies, which compete in the
mobile-device market, is now under way in at least five
countries. In April, Cupertino, California-based Apple sued
Samsung in federal court in Oakland, California, alleging the
company’s Galaxy phone and tablet computers “slavishly” copy
the iPhone and iPad. Apple also has a case pending against
Samsung in its home country of  South Korea .  Samsung, which supplies memory chips to Apple, had
previously sued Apple in Seoul, Tokyo,  San Francisco  and
Mannheim, Germany.  Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the suit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
