Haukur Thor Haraldsson, a former
Landsbanki Islands hf director, was sentenced to two years in
prison for embezzling 118 million kronur ($1 million) following
the island’s economic collapse, a Reykjavik court ruled today.  Haraldsson transferred the funds out of an account of
 Landsbanki’s  subsidiary, NBI Holdings Ltd., into his personal
account prior to the lender’s collapse in 2008. He maintained
that he acted to prevent the funds from being lost in the
downfall of the bank.  The District Court of Reykjavik  found  it was “beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused amassed the funds for personal
profit” and “is therefore guilty of embezzlement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
