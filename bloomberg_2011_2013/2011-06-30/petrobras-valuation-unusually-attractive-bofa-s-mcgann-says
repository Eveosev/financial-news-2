Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, presents an “unusually
attractive” valuation as market concerns are “overdone,” Bank
of America Corp. said.  Petrobras’s preferred shares are trading at an
“unwarranted” 22 percent discount to global peers with a price
6.8 times estimated 2011 earnings, Frank McGann, an analyst at
Bank of America, wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday.  “Petrobras’s 2011-2015 plan should be announced over the
next few weeks and should reassure investors, with only a
limited increase” in total capital expenditure, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
