Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) ,  Japan ’s
largest brokerage, cut Chief Executive Officer Kenichi Watanabe’s salary by 42 percent last fiscal year after earnings
for the period plunged.  Watanabe’s pay including  stock options  for the 12 months
ended March 31 fell to 172 million yen ($2.1 million) from 299
million yen a year earlier, the company said in its annual
report filed to the Ministry of Finance today.  Nomura is trimming executive salaries after profit fell 58
percent in the year ended March on losses at its Asian and
European businesses. The investment bank’s shares touched a 30-
year low earlier this month, as a record earthquake hampers
business at home while  Europe ’s debt crisis and a weakening
global economy weigh on overseas markets.  Tokyo-based Nomura paid five executives more than 100
million yen last fiscal year, while seven officials received
that level a year earlier, the report said. Deputy President
Takumi Shibata’s compensation was cut 38 percent to 155 million
yen from 252 million yen a year earlier.  The securities firm reduced total compensation for its top
10 executives to 899 million yen for the year ended March 31,
from 1.45 billion yen a year earlier, according to documents
posted on Nomura’s website earlier this month.  Nomura’s stock has slumped about 72 percent in Tokyo
trading since it acquired posted Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
Asian and European operations in 2008. The shares fell to 371
yen on June 17, the lowest closing price since March 1981. They
fell 0.3 percent to 396 yen at the 3 p.m. close of Tokyo
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
