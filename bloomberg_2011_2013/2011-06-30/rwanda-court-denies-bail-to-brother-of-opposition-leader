A Rwandan court denied bail to Lt.
Col Rugigana Ngabo, who was arrested in August on charges of
threatening national security.  “We are denying bail on the grounds that the charges he is
facing are grave,” Major Bernard Ndayisaba, the president of
the Rwandan Military High Court, said at the hearing.  Ngabo is brother to former Rwandan army chief, Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, who was sentenced in absentia in January to 24
years in prison for threatening state security, sectarianism and
criminal conspiracy. Currently an opposition leader in exile in
 South Africa , Nyamwasa was shot and wounded last year. Rwanda’s
government has denied any involvement in the attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
