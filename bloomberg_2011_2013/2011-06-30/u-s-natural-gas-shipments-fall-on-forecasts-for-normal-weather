Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell for the second day on forecasts
of normal temperatures in the center of the country, decreasing
the need for fuel to power air-conditioners.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments fell 0.9 percent to 19.1 million
dekatherms (18.6 billion cubic feet), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Much of the East and South will have above-normal
temperatures until July 8, while the Central U.S. will be
normal, MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland, said in
a note to clients.  Shipments to power generators in New York dropped 42
percent. The high in New York today may reach 82 degrees
Fahrenheit (28 Celsius), which is normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  Scheduled gas shipments for U.S. residences fell 2.1
percent to 23.3 million dekatherms after a 17 percent drop
yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the Transco Zone 6 hub, where gas is
delivered to  New York , gained 3.16 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$4.7714 per million British thermal units yesterday on the
Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
gained 5.6 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $4.3971 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
