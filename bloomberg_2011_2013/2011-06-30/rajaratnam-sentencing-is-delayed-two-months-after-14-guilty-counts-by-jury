Raj Rajaratnam’s sentencing on
insider-trading charges was rescheduled to Sept. 27 from July by
a federal judge in New York.  Rajaratnam, 54, the co-founder of Galleon Group LLC, is at
the center of one of the largest illegal stock-tipping cases
ever brought by the U.S. He was found guilty May 11 by a jury on
five counts of conspiracy and nine counts of securities fraud.  When he was convicted, U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell
set sentencing for July 29. Today’s order by Holwell postponing
the date included a letter from prosecutors saying that they and
Rajaratnam agreed to it.  The U.S. said Rajaratnam engaged in a seven-year conspiracy
to trade on inside information from corporate executives,
bankers, consultants, traders and directors of public companies
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. He gained $63.8 million as a
result of the scheme, prosecutors said.  Prosecutors said on the day of the verdict that Rajaratnam
faces from 15 1/2 years to 19 1/2 years in prison when he is
sentenced.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
