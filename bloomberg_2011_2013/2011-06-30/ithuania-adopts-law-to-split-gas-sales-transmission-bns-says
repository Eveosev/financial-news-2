Lithuania’s parliament adopted
measures to separate natural-gas sales from transmission
ownership at utility  Lietuvos Dujos (LDJ1L)  AB,  Baltic News Service 
reported.  Lawmakers voted 81 to 23, with seven abstentions, to back
the measures requiring ownership of gas-transmission pipelines
to be transferred to the state in two years, the newswire said.  The government asked parliament on May 19 to approve the
split, spurring criticism from OAO Gazprom and  E.ON AG (EOAN) , Lietuvos
Dujos’s majority owners. The government says the initiative
follows from the European Union’s policy of making dominant
energy companies give competitors access to transmission
networks.  -- Editor: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
