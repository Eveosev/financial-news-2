Democratic Republic of Congo’s plans
to develop the Inga 3 hydropower project may cost more and take
longer than initially anticipated,  Reuters  said, citing Hela
Cheikhrouhou, director of energy and environment at  African
Development Bank .  Current plans for the development of the project that will
cost as much as $10 billion entail drilling as many as 70
kilometres of tunnels into rock formations whose geology is not
well known, and only drawing a maximum of 3,500 megawatts of
power, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
