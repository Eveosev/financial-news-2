Louis Erard, a maker of Swiss
watches that cost within a range of 1,500 francs ($1,800) to
3,000 francs, said new rules on the supply of watch components
will prevent the company from growing in 2012,  L’Agefi  reported.  Switzerland ’s competition regulator is allowing  Swatch
Group AG (UHR)  to reduce deliveries of components next year, and the
watch industry isn’t ready, the newspaper cited Louis Erard
Chief Executive Officer Alain Spinedi as saying in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
