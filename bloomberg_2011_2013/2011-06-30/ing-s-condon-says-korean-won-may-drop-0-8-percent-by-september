Tim Condon , head of research for
 Asia  at ING Groep NV in Singapore, comments on the outlook for
 South Korea ’s won in a research note released today. He
forecasts the won will weaken 0.8 percent to 1,080 per dollar in
three months.  “We think the elevated level of banks’ short-term external
debt is the main reason that the  Korean won  is among Asia’s most
sensitive currencies to fluctuations in investor risk appetites.
It depreciates more against the  U.S. dollar  than other Asian
currencies during bouts of risk-off and appreciates more during
bouts of risk-on.”  The won could touch its recent high of 1,065 per dollar in
a “Greece risk-on rally” but the rally will be short-lived, he
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
