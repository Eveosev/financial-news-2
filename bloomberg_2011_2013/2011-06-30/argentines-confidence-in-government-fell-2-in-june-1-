Argentines confidence in their
government fell by 2 percent in June from the previous month,
according to a poll released by Buenos Aires-based Torcuato Di
Tella university.  Confidence rose 43 percent from a year earlier to a reading
of 2.29 on a scale of zero to five, the poll said.  About 58 percent of those surveyed said President  Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner  is facing up to the country’s problems or
knows how to resolve them, the survey of 1,200 people from June
1-21 said. The poll, undertaken by Poliarquia Consultores on
behalf of the university, had a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points.  A total of 46 percent of respondents said they had a good
image of the government, compared with 49 percent in last
month’s poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
