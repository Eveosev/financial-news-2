The U.K.’s Medical Research Council
is in advanced discussions with the Chinese government about
establishing a joint drug development company, project Dynasty,
that could bring up to 500 million pounds ($803 million) of
investment to the U.K. and employ 850 scientists over the next
five years, the Financial Times reported, citing Dave Tapolczay,
head of MRC Technology, the council’s commercial arm. The talks
could be concluded as soon as tomorrow, Tapolczay said,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
