Copper rose to a nine-week high
after the Greek parliament supported a European bailout,
bolstering prospects for metal demand.  Euro-area finance ministers are set to approve the next aid
payment due  Greece  and outline a second rescue after banks lined
up behind debt-rollover plans. The dollar fell for the fourth
staright day against a basket of major currencies, boosting the
appeal of raw materials.  The vote “gave a bit of support to the market,” said Nick Riley, the head of London Metal Exchange sales at Marex
Financial Ltd., one of 12 companies on the LME floor. “The
dollar weakness is also helping the commodities.”  Copper futures for September delivery advanced 5.85 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to settle at $4.2825 a pound at 1:29 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Earlier, the price reached $4.2875, the
highest for a most-active contract since April 28.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose $110,
or 1.2 percent, to $9,430 a metric ton ($4.28 a pound). Zinc,
lead and tin also advanced. Aluminum fell.  In the second quarter, copper in New York dropped 0.6
percent after demand waned in  China , the world’s biggest metal
consumer. Futures have dropped 8.1 percent from a record $4.6575
on Feb. 15 and are down 3.7 percent this year.  A faltering global economy has damped demand for
commodities. Today, a government report showed more Americans
than forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last
week, indicating little progress in a jobs recovery.  The U.S. Federal Reserve’s second round of quantitative
easing, also known as QE2, concludes today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
