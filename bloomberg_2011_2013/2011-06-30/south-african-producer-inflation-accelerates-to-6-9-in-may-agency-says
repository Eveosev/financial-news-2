The cost of goods leaving South
African factories and mines rose at a faster pace in May than
the previous month, reflecting a rise in the price of food,
electricity, oil and other commodities.  Producer prices increased an annual 6.9 percent after
gaining 6.6 percent in April, Pretoria-based Statistics  South
Africa  said on its website today. The median estimate of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 7.1 percent. Prices rose
0.4 percent in the month.  “Commodity prices have corrected slightly off earlier
highs, which should help to contain producer inflation in the
months ahead,”  Carmen Altenkirch , an economist at Nedbank Group
Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “However, base
effects and the return of some pricing power to producers should
push prices at the manufacturing level up modestly.”  The price of crude fell 9.9 percent in May on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , trimming its 12-month gain to 39 percent.
Higher factory-gate prices may feed through to consumer
inflation, placing pressure on the central bank to raise
 interest rates  from a 30-year low.  Consumer inflation accelerated to 4.6 percent from 4.2
percent in April. The central bank’s inflation target range is
between 3 percent and 6 percent.  Mixed Signals  Reserve Bank Governor Gill Marcus left the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 5.5 percent on May 12, while warning
that the outlook for inflation had deteriorated. The bank
expects inflation to average 5.1 percent this year and 6 percent
in 2012, with a temporary breach of its target in the first
quarter of next year.  The bank’s monetary policy committee is due to announce its
next interest-rate decision on July 21. South Africa’s economic
data is giving mixed signals about what interest rate is needed,
Marcus said in  Pretoria  today.  The rand traded at 6.7888 per dollar at 12:25 p.m. in
Johannesburg, little changed from before the release of the
inflation data and stronger than 6.8259 late yesterday.  Bonds advanced for the first day in three. The 13.5 percent
notes due 2015 jumped 17 cents to 121.41 rand, driving the yield
down five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.45
percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 34 cents
to 89.26 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
