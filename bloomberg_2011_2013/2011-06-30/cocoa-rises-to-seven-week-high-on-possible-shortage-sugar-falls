Arabica coffee jumped to a two-week
high on concern that output in  Brazil , the world’s biggest
producer, may drop because of adverse weather. Cocoa and orange
juice also rose, while sugar fell.  Frost is possible in coffee-growing regions in Brazil’s
Parana state on July 4, Donald Keeney, a meteorologist at MDA
EarthSat Weather in Rockville, Maryland, said today. Brazi’s
state forecaster earlier this week said the cold already may
have done some damage.  “The frost concern remains,” said Luis Rangel, vice
president of commodity derivatives at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey
City ,  New Jersey . “We are also seeing some end-of-the month
buying.”  Arabica coffee for September delivery climbed 4.9 cents, or
1.9 percent, to $2.656 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
 New York , after touching $2.668, the highest since June 16. The
price climbed 0.6 percent this quarter and has risen 10 percent
for the year.  Commodities prices have been supported this year by
government spending programs to revive growth. The  Federal
Reserve ’s second round of quantitative easing concludes today.
The central bank plans to buy between $4 billion and $5 billion
of notes due from December 2016 to June 2018. The purchases will
be the last in the central bank’s effort to add $600 billion to
the economy, according to its website.  Cocoa futures for September delivery rose $32, or 1
percent, to $3,151 a metric ton on ICE, gaining for the second
quarter in three.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery fell 0.58 cent, or
2.2 percent, to 26.34 cents a pound in New York, retreating for
the second straight quarter. Prices are down 18 percent in 2011,
heading for the first annual decline since 2007.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 0.3 cent,
or 0.2 percent, to $1.871 a pound, capping a 15 percent gain
this quarter.  In  London , refined sugar retreated, while robusta coffee
and cocoa advanced on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
