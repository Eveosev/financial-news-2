Derek Jeter  may resume his quest for
a 3,000th career hit on July 4 against the  Cleveland Indians .  Jeter got his 2,994th hit in a 1-0 loss to the Indians on
June 13 before sustaining a strained right calf that led to his
first stint on the disabled list since 2003. He’s seeking to
become the first member of the  New York Yankees  and the 28th
player in Major League Baseball history to reach 3,000 hits.  The 37-year-old Jeter has been working out in Tampa,
 Florida , and may play the first of two rehabilitation games in
two days for Double-A Trenton, which hosts Altoona, Yankees
General Manager Brian Cashman said on the team’s website.  “We’ll see how he feels (today),” Cashman said. “If all
goes well, he could be looking at a rehab assignment as early as
Saturday.”  Jeter, in his 17th season as the Yankees’ shortstop, would
be the first major-leaguer to reach 3,000 hits since Craig Biggio in 2007.  While former Yankees Dave Winfield, Rickey Henderson and
Wade Boggs topped 3,000 hits during their careers, Jeter would
be the first to reach the mark while playing with the 27-time
World Series champion.  Pete Rose holds the major-league record of 4,256 hits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
