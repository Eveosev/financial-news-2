Copper may rise after climbing above
a moving average amid reduced concern  Greece  may default on its
debt, a survey showed.  Six of 11 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 55 percent, said prices will gain next week. Three
predicted a drop and two forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was up 3.6 percent for this week at $9,375
a metric ton by 4:45 p.m. yesterday on the London Metal
Exchange.  The metal yesterday advanced above its 100-day moving
average at $9,362 a ton for the first time since April. Copper
has traded near or above its 200-day moving average since early
May. Moving averages can serve as directional signals for a
commodity, security or index to traders and investors who study
technical charts.  “Technical levels getting breached” were “forcing shorts
to cover,” said  Randy North , a trader at  RBC Capital Markets  in
 New York . Short-covering refers to purchases that reverse bets
on declining prices.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of June 24.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
69 of the past 143 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 6 Bearish: 3 Hold: 2  To contact the reporter on this story:
