Indonesia ’s rupiah had a second
quarterly gain and bonds rose as overseas investors added to
holdings of the nation’s assets as economists predicted
inflation eased for a fifth month.  The government will report tomorrow that consumer prices
rose 5.40 percent this month from a year earlier after having
increased 5.98 percent in May, according to the median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The currency pared its
losses for the month to 0.5 percent after Greek lawmakers passed
budget cuts needed for the nation to secure financial aid.  “We’re probably going to see weaker inflation tomorrow and
that’s supporting sentiment in the market,” said  Gundy Cahyadi ,
a Singapore-based economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
“The Greek austerity package that was passed also lifted risk
appetite; there’s a relief rally in the market.”  The rupiah appreciated 1.4 percent this quarter to 8,584
per dollar as of 3:28 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency rose 0.5 percent from June
28. Financial markets in Indonesia were closed yesterday for a
public holiday.  Overseas investors raised  holdings  of Indonesian  government
bonds  by 4.5 percent this month through June 27 to 235.37
trillion rupiah ($27.4 billion), according to official data.  The government’s 10-year bonds rose. The yield on the 8.25
percent notes maturing in July 2021 fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 7.55 percent from June 28, according
to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
