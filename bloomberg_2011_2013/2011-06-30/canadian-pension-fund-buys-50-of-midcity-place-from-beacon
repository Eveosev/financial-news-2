The Ontario Municipal Employees
Retirement System, a Canadian pension fund, purchased a 50
percent stake in MidCity Place in  London  from an affiliate of
U.S. private-equity firm Beacon Capital Partners LLC.  OMERS made the acquisition through its Oxford Properties
real estate unit, the fund said today in a statement. The
purchase price wasn’t disclosed. GM Real Estate advised Beacon
and Farebrother acted for Oxford Properties, the statement said.  “This acquisition is consistent with our European strategy
to acquire large scale high quality assets,” said Paul Brundage, a vice president at Oxford Properties, in the
statement. “It allows Oxford to diversify our London portfolio
with exposure to the Midtown market.”  MidCity Place is in the Holborn area of London and is the
U.K. headquarters of Westfield Group, the world’s largest owner
of shopping malls.  To contact the reporter on this story:
