Serbia  will receive 137 million
euros ($198.5 million) from  Germany  to overhaul  power plants ,
strengthen institutions and reduce unemployment.  About 105 million euros will go to energy projects,
including 69 million euros to modernize the 56-year-old Vlasina
hydroelectric plant in eastern Serbia, Deputy Prime Minister
Bozidar Djelic said today in Belgrade. An additional 35 million
euros will be used to store ash at the coal-fired Nikola Tesla
plant west of Belgrade.  “Germany has been the biggest donor among individual
countries,” Djelic said after he and German Ambassador Wolfram
Maas signed the agreement. Germany has provided 1.09 billion
euros of financial support to Serbia since 2000, 40 percent of
which was grants, he said.  Seven million euros of the latest aid package will be spent
to strengthen institutions and state administration, and 25
million euros will be allocated to projects designed to
stimulate economic growth and create jobs, Djelic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
