Italy’s inflation rate surged to
the highest in almost three years in September as the price of
crude oil increased.  The inflation rate based on European Union measurements
rose to 3.5 percent from 2.3 percent in August, Rome-based
national statistics office Istat said in a preliminary report
today. That was the highest since October 2008 and compared with
a 2.7 percent median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Prices advanced 1.9 percent from August.  Inflation rates in the euro region are “likely to stay
clearly above” 2 percent over the coming months before falling
below the central bank’s ceiling in 2012, European Central Bank
President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on Sept. 8. That assessment
is based on “moderate economic growth,” he said.  Crude  oil prices  were 26 percent higher at the end of
September from a year earlier. Istat had no breakdown of
harmonized Italian prices. The inflation rate in  Germany ,
 Europe ’s biggest economy, rose to 2.8 percent in September, the
fastest pace in three years, data showed on Sept. 28.  Italy’s government last month passed 54 billion euros ($73
billion) in austerity measures in exchange for European Central
Bank purchases of the nation’s bonds on the secondary market.
The package of spending cuts and tax increases may weigh on
Italian growth.  Last week, both the  International Monetary Fund  and the
government cut their forecasts for Italian growth. On Sept. 22,
the  Finance Ministry  said the euro area’s third-biggest economy
will expand 0.7 percent this year and 0.6 percent next year,
compared with April forecasts of 1.1 percent and 1.3 percent,
respectively. The IMF predicted an expansion of 0.6 percent in
2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
