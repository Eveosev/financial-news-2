second day on tighter supplies and forecasts of higher cooling
demand in the U.S. West that would spur the need for the fuel to
power air-conditioners.  Alberta  gas for August delivery increased 0.25 cent to

on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 5.9 cents to settle at $4.374 per million Btu.  “It’s probably a little bit tighter supply in the province
at the moment because of field maintenance, and maybe there’s a
little bit of fiscal short covering by traders, going into our
long weekend,”  Martin King , an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital
Corp. in Calgary, said in a telephone interview.  Cooling demand in  Los Angeles  will be 48 percent above
normal until at least July 7, according to Belton, Missouri-
