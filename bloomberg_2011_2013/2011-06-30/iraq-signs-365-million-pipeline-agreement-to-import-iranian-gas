Iraq signed a $365 million agreement
to install a pipeline network to import natural gas from  Iran 
for power stations in the country.  The pipelines will eventually supply 25 million cubic
meters of Iranian natural gas a day to the Sadr, al-Quds and
South Baghdad power stations in the Iraqi capital, Mosaab Serri,
a spokesman for the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity, said by
telephone today. The agreement with Iran, which holds the
worldâ€™s second-largest gas reserves, requires the approval of
the Iraqi Council of Ministers and Parliament.  The pipelines will pass the Mansouriya gas field, which is
due to supply gas to the two  power plants  instead of Iran
starting 2016, Serri said in a statement on May 22. Kuwait
Energy Co., Turkiye Petrolleri AO and Korea Gas, known as Kogas,
secured rights to develop Mansouriya.  Iraq  and Iran have also reached an initial agreement to
install another pipeline network from the Iranian region of
Abadan to Basra in southern Iraq where it will feed a planned
1,250-megawatt power station, Serri said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
