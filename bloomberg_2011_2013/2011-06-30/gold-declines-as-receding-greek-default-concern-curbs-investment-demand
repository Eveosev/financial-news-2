Gold declined for the first time in
three days in New York as  Greece ’s drive to stave off the euro
area’s first sovereign default curbs demand for the metal as a
protection of wealth.  Greek lawmakers backed a bill to authorize an austerity
plan required to keep rescue aid flowing after Prime Minister
George Papandreou yesterday garnered enough votes for his 78
billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget cuts and state-
asset sales. The metal has declined 4.7 percent from the record
set at in early May. Still, gold rose in the second quarter,
which ended today, the 11th straight quarterly gain.  “With the sovereign premium lifted, gold needs to find new
drivers if it is to regain its highs,”  Edel Tully , a London-
based analyst at UBS AG, said in a report. Still, prices are
“unlikely to fall far. Anyone who wanted to sell gold is likely
to have done so in the second half of last week.”  Gold futures for August delivery fell $7.60, or 0.5
percent, to settle at $1,502.80 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Prices climbed 0.9 percent in the previous
two sessions.  Gold has gained 5.7 percent in 2011 after climbing the past
10 years, the longest run of gains in at least nine decades in
London.  Europe ’s debt crisis helped bullion reach a record
$1,577.40 on May 2. Prices declined as much as 4.4 percent from
last week’s highest level to touch a five-week low of $1,490.80
on June 27.  ‘Vigilance’ Mode  Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude Juncker , who leads a group of
euro-area finance ministers, said the Greek parliament’s
decision paves the way for payment of the next aid installment
from euro-area governments and the  International Monetary Fund .  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said on
June 28 that policy makers are in “strong vigilance mode”
ahead of a meeting next week, supporting expectations for an
interest-rate increase. The ECB raised its benchmark rate in
April for the first time in almost three years, lifting it by a
quarter point to 1.25 percent.  The  Federal Reserve ’s second round of quantitative easing
concludes today. The Fed plans to buy between $4 billion and $5
billion of notes due from December 2016 to June 2018. The
purchases will be the last in the central bank’s effort to add
$600 billion to the economy, according to its website.  Business activity in the U.S. unexpectedly expanded at a
faster pace in June, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago
Inc. said today.  Mexico  Reduces Reserves  Mexico reduced its  gold reserves  by 0.18 metric ton to
