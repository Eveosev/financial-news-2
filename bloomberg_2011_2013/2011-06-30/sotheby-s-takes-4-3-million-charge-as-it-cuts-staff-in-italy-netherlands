Sotheby’s (BID) , the world’s largest
publicly traded auction company, said it will take a charge of
about $4.3 million in 2011 as it cuts staff in  Italy  and the
Netherlands.  U.S.-based Sotheby’s is to reduce staff levels by 23, it
said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It
will end local auctions in the Netherlands and significantly
reduce sales in Italy.  The restructuring plan will cut revenue by about $10
million in 2012, Sotheby’s said. It also said the plan will save
$7 million in expenses beginning in 2012.  Sotheby’s shares rose $0.53 to $42.79 in New York Stock
Exchange trading yesterday.  To contact the writer on the story:
