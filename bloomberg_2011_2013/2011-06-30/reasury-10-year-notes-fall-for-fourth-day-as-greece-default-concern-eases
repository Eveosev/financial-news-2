Treasuries fell, pushing benchmark
10-year note yields to the highest level in June, as  Greece ’s
parliament approved a second bill to authorize austerity
measures needed for further financial aid.  Ten-year notes slid for a fourth straight day in the
longest losing streak since February as stocks rose, a measure
of U.S. business activity improved and the  Federal Reserve  ended
a $600 billion program of debt buying. Bonds pared gains in the
second quarter as the three government note auctions this week
drew poor demand.  “We have clearly taken out the Greek risk as far as it
impacted Treasuries,” said  David Ader , head of government bond
strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“From this day forward, we will have to deal with the Treasury
supply on our own. We are adjusting to the new world.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 3.16 percent at 5:14 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
securities maturing in May 2021 dropped 13/32, or $4.06 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 22/32.  The 10-year note yields touched 3.22 percent, the highest
level since May 19. Yields on two-year notes were little changed
at 0.46 percent after reaching 0.51 percent, the highest level
since May 26. The five-year note yields advanced seven basis
points to 1.76 percent after increasing to 1.81 percent, also
the highest level since May 26.  Gain in Stocks  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose for a fourth day,
rallying 1 percent. Crude oil for August delivery gained 0.4
percent to $95.14 a barrel  Treasuries returned 2.6 percent this quarter as of
yesterday, after losing 0.1 percent in the three months ended
March 31, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.
 U.S. debt  has gained 2.5 percent in 2011.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said investors should sell five-
year Treasury notes on speculation yields will rise to 2.2
percent, a level last reached in April.  Investors should exit the trade if the yield falls to 1.4
percent, London-based strategists Francesco U. Garzarelli and
Constantin Burgi wrote in a research note.  The Fed purchased $4.909 billion of Treasuries maturing
from June 2017 to June 2018 today in its last operation under
the second round of quantitative easing.  The buyback included $4.405 billion of the $16.252 billion
in seven-year notes that primary dealers purchased yesterday at
the U.S. government’s seven-year note auction. The central bank
ended up with 15 percent of the $29 billion total sold.  Auction Demand  Yesterday’s offering produced the lowest participation in
more than two years from a class of investors including foreign
central banks. The $35 billion government auction of five-year
securities on June 28 drew the lowest demand in a year. A record
low yield of 0.395 percent at the $35 billion offering of two-
year notes a day earlier drew the weakest demand from the group
including central banks since February 2008.  Bonds also dropped today as the Institute for Supply
Management-Chicago Inc.’s purchasing managers’ index climbed to
61.1 this month from 56.6 in May. The median forecast of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop in 54.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  “It shows that the economy is not falling off a cliff, so
we need to give some of that back if it’s not contracting as
much as many had feared,” said  Anthony Cronin , a trader in New
York at Societe Generale SA, which as one of the 20 primary
dealers is obligated to participate in U.S. auctions.  Greece Austerity  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s drive to stave off
the euro area’s first sovereign default stayed on track after
lawmakers backed a bill to authorize an austerity plan required
to keep rescue aid flowing.  The premier won the vote by 155 to 136, allowing him to
implement a 78 billion-euro ($112 billion) package of tax
increases and asset sales that was a condition of receiving
further European Union aid.  “The news out of Greece is not a surprise, but it’s
another hurdle that’s been crossed,” said  Chris Ahrens , head
U.S. rates strategist in Stamford, Connecticut, at UBS AG, a
primary dealer. “The better performance of risk assets is
weighing on Treasuries.”  Treasuries have rallied this quarter on speculation the
 U.S. economy  is stalling and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis may
damp the global recovery.  Employers in America added the fewest jobs in eight months
in May, and the  unemployment rate  increased to 9.1 percent, the
Labor Department reported June 3.  Initial jobless claims fell by 1,000 to 428,000 in the week
ended June 25, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists
in a Bloomberg News survey projected a drop to 420,000.  President  Barack Obama  is trying to reach a compromise with
Republican lawmakers who are seeking spending cuts before they
agree to raise the nation’s borrowing limit, now capped at $14.3
trillion. The Treasury Department has said it has until Aug. 2
before its ability to pay the U.S. debt expires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
