ABC Aerolineas SA, which operates
the Mexican airline Interjet, scrapped plans for an initial
public offering that was set to price today and would have been
 Mexico ’s third new listing of the year.  Interjet decided against carrying out the offer “at this
moment” because of a “complex situation” in global financial
markets, the company said in an e-mailed statement.  Interjet had sought to raise as much as $300 million in the
IPO, according to two people familiar with the matter, who
couldn’t be identified because the details of the transaction
weren’t public.  Mexico has had two IPOs this year. Javier Artigas Alarcon,
senior vice president for strategic planning at Bolsa Mexicana
de Valores SAB, the Mexican stock exchange operator, projected
in April that offerings would total 10 this year.  Interjet planned to raise money to add routes and buy
planes, a preliminary prospectus showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
