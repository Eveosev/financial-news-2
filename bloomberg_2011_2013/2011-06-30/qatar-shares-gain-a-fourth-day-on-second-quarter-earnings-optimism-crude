Qatar ’s shares rose to the highest
in more than two weeks on speculation second-quarter earnings
will exceed estimates. Bahrain’s measure also advanced.  Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC, the Persian Gulf country’s
second-biggest bank by assets, climbed 1.8 percent.  Industries
Qatar QSC (IQCD) , the second-largest petrochemicals company in the
 Middle East , increased to the highest in almost two weeks.
Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  added 0.3 percent to 8,361.07, the highest
since June 15, at the 1:15 p.m. close in Doha. The measure
jumped 1.8 percent this week, trimming the decline for the
quarter to 1.1 percent.  “There are some positive expectations” for second-quarter
earnings in Qatar, said Ashraf Yassin, a Doha-based sales trader
at QInvest. “Locals are positioning themselves before the
release” of the financial statements.  Commercial Bank of Qatar (CBQK)  on April 19 said first-quarter
profit rose 9 percent to 446 million riyals on gains from
interest income. Commercial Bank gained to 72.1 riyals, the
highest since June 1.  Industries Qatar gained 0.4 percent to 136.2 riyals, the
highest since June 19.  About 5.1 million shares were traded in Qatar today,
compared with a 12-month daily average of 8.8 million. Volumes
are low as it’s the last day of the month and not all stock
markets in the region are open, QInvest’s Yassin said.  Exchanges in the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait are
closed for a Muslim holiday, while  Saudi Arabia ’s market is
closed for the weekend. The Bahrain Bourse All Share Index, the
only other Persian Gulf stock market to trade today, increased
0.2 percent, the most since June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
