Japan ’s bonds dropped for a second
day after Asian stocks extended a global rally in equities,
decreasing demand for the relative safety of government debt.  Yields on benchmark 10-year bonds advanced to a two-week
high as the Greek parliament’s passage of an austerity package
reduced the risk the nation will default. Treasuries slumped in
 New York  yesterday, with 10-year yields surging 25 basis points
this week.  “The gain in stocks isn’t a positive for the  bond
market ,” said  Shinji Nomura , chief debt strategist in Tokyo at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., one of the 24 primary dealers
obliged to bid at government debt sales. “There is an unwinding
of the flight to quality because  Greece  looks like it will avoid
default.”  The benchmark 10-year yield added 1.5 basis points to 1.13
percent as of 3:23 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2 percent
security due June 2021 lost 0.136 yen to 100.626 yen.  The yield touched 1.14 percent, the highest level since
June 15. It has fallen 12.5 basis points for the past three
months, the biggest quarterly decline since September.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery dropped 0.30
to 141.04 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares climbed 1.4
percent, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.8
percent yesterday. Ten-year Treasury yields fell one basis point
to 3.1 percent today.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  clinched enough
votes yesterday to pass the first part of an austerity plan
aimed at meeting European Union aid requirements and staving off
default for his debt-laden nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
