Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
will transfer 1.4 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) of high-risk
U.K. commercial property loans into a structure controlled by
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  in a deal that will allow the state-owned
bank to retain a share of future profits, the Financial Times
reported, without attribution.  Blackstone, which will buy a minority position in the
portfolio, will take over management of the loans from RBS, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
