Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore , comments on the outlook for the
South Korean won in a telephone interview. The bank forecasts
the won will strengthen 0.7 percent to 1,060 per dollar by the
end of the third quarter and 2.7 percent to 1,040 by December.  “ China  is a huge trading partner with  South Korea . We
still expect capital inflows and the yuan appreciation trend to
support a stronger won.”  The won’s gains will be limited as South Korea’s current-
account surplus could “fizzle out in the second half of the
year as exports are expected to slow,” she said. “In addition
to the external risks, policy risks will be one to watch out
for.”  “In terms of policy risks, it is regarding the measures
taken by the government to limit the volatility of capital
inflows.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
