What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open down the 30-cent trading
limit on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after government reports
showed reduce consumption in the quarter ended May 31 and
farmers planted more corn than they said in March, said Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness for Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 15 cents to 25 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis Grain
Exchange  after the Department of Agriculture said farmers sowed
more spring-variety crops than expected, Grow said.  -- Soybean futures may open 20 cents to 25 cents a bushel lower
in Chicago after the government said demand slowed in the
quarter ended May 31, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.6 to 0.8 cent a pound lower, and soybean-meal
futures may open down $7 to $10 per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
