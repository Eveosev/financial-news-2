European stocks rose, posting the
biggest two-day gain for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index in almost
seven months, as Greek lawmakers approved a bill authorizing
austerity measures, qualifying the country for further aid.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  jumped 11 percent after
scrapping its bid for TMX Group Inc. and UBS AG said the bourse
may now be a bid target.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  surged 9.7
percent after the U.K.’s biggest mortgage lender said it will
make savings of 1.5 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) by 2014.  The Stoxx 600 rose 1.1 percent to 272.86 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London for the biggest two-day gain since December. The
gauge has lost 1.1 percent this quarter, snapping three quarters
of gains, on concern that  Greece  will fail to repay all its
debt. The benchmark measure fell 2.9 percent in June.  “The recent pullback provides a buying opportunity,” said
 Robert Buckland , chief global equity strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in London in a report to clients today. “Despite a
slowdown, we expect the economic and earnings recovery to be
sustained.”  National benchmark indexes rose in every western European
market.  France ’s CAC 40 Index and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index rose
1.5 percent, while  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 1.1 percent.  Greece Austerity Debate  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou won a second ballot
to execute measures ranging from tax increases to asset sales
today after he clinched victory on a bill setting out his
strategy to cut the deficit yesterday. A total of 155 lawmakers
in the 300-seat parliament supported the law.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will complete its $600 billion
bond-purchase program today. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has
surged 24 percent since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s Aug. 27
speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, when he indicated that the
central bank would start a second round of bond purchases, known
as quantitative easing or QE, to help stimulate the economy.  By contrast,  Europe ’s Stoxx 600 has climbed 8.6 percent as
sovereign-debt concern limited gains. The benchmark gauge has
dropped 1.1 percent so far this year, while the  S&P 500  has
rallied 5 percent.  European stocks extended gains after the Institute for
Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said today its business barometer
unexpectedly rose to 61.1 in June from 56.6 in May. Figures
greater than 50 signal expansion.  LSE Shares Rally  LSE jumped 11 percent to 1,061 pence, the highest price in
three years, after the London and Toronto exchanges said they
won’t proceed with their friendly C$3.29 billion ($3.4 billion)
merger because they didn’t get the required two-thirds of votes
cast by proxy before today’s shareholder meeting.  LSE’s failed bid marks the third time in two months that
one of the world’s biggest equity venues failed to complete a
deal aimed at restoring growth.  Analysts at UBS AG added LSE to their mergers and
acquisitions watch list, saying that the London exchange may now
become a bid target. The brokerage said there is a good chance
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. could offer as much as 1,150 pence a share
for LSE.  Lloyds surged 9.7 percent to 49 pence after Britain’s
largest mortgage lender said the savings will come from fewer
management posts, centralizing some functions and withdrawing
from more than 15 of its overseas units.  BG, Galp, Repsol  BG Group Plc (BG/)  soared 4.7 percent to 1,414 pence after the
U.K.’s third-largest oil and gas producer doubled its estimate
of reserves and resources in the Santos Basin in  Brazil  to about
6 billion barrels of oil equivalent net to the company.  BG along with partners, Petroleo Brasileiro SA,  Galp
Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  and  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  plan to pump 2.3 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2017 off Brazil after they
committed to a $13 billion investment program last year.  Galp rallied 6.5 percent to 16.45 euros in Lisbon, while
Repsol jumped 3.2 percent to 23.94 euros in  Madrid .  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/)  jumped 3.4 percent to 37.8 pence after
Britain’s second-biggest homebuilder by volume said its U.K.
operation is headed for a double-digit earnings before interest
and taxes margin in 2012.  K+S AG, Europe’s biggest potash producer, dropped 1.3
percent to 53 euros and Yara International ASA, the largest
maker of nitrogen fertilizers, slid 4.2 percent to 303.70 kroner
as a U.S. Department of Agriculture report showed that U.S.
grain acreage and inventories topped analysts’ estimates.  Renewable Energy Corp. ASA dropped 3.2 percent to 9.28
kroner after Deutsche Bank AG downgraded the maker of solar-
energy products to “sell” from “hold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
