Chinese police arrested 36 people
after a probe of fraud on Alibaba.com and other websites that
cheated overseas buyers out of more than $6 million, Alibaba
Group Holding Ltd. said.  The people are accused of using Alibaba.com and other
websites to imitate legitimate vendors and sell products to
businesses outside of  China , spokesman John Spelich said today,
confirming a report in  Alizila , an Alibaba-owned news site.
Chinese suppliers pay a fee to list merchandise on the site, and
Alibaba.com  says  it has an authentication process to check that
suppliers are credible.  The suspects were arrested from April 11 to 15 after an
investigation involving Alibaba.com and police from the city of
Hangzhou, where Alibaba Group is based, Alizila reported.
Alibaba.com has refunded $1.94 million to victims of the scam,
the website said.  Alibaba.com said in February that it found more than 2,300
vendors used its website to defraud global buyers, prompting its
then chief executive officer and chief operating officer -- who
werenâ€™t accused of wrongdoing -- to resign. The number of fraud
complaints received by Alibaba in June fell 70 percent from
February, Spelich said.  Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo! Inc., the largest U.S.
Web portal, is the biggest shareholder of Alibaba Group. Yahoo
shares rose 15 cents to $15.04 at 4 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
