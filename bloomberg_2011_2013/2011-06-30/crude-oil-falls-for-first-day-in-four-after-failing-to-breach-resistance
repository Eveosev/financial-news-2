Oil declined, trimming the biggest
weekly gain in almost three months, as signs of slowing
manufacturing growth in  China  and the U.S., the world’s biggest
energy users, stoked speculation fuel demand may falter.  Futures slipped as much as 1.3 percent, their first decline
in four days, after China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to
the lowest since February 2009. A U.S. report today may show a
slowdown in factory activity. Prices also slid as OPEC boosted
supplies and the U.S. offered 30 million barrels of oil from
strategic reserves under an International Energy Agency plan to
stabilize prices.  “Together with the direct impact of high  oil prices , the
slowdown in economic activity is having a strong impact on oil
demand,”  Christophe Barret , a London-based oil analyst at
Credit Agricole SA, said in a note today.  Crude for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  declined as much as $1.26 to $94.16 a barrel and was at
$94.30 at 1:42 p.m. London time. The contract yesterday rose 65
cents to $95.42. Prices have risen 29 percent in the past year
and 3.4 percent this week.  Brent oil for August settlement slid $1.57, or 1.4 percent,
to $110.91 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract traded at a premium of $16.59 to
WTI. The spread reached a record $22.29 a barrel on June 15.  China Slowdown  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.9 in June
from 52 in May, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said in an e-mailed statement today. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists was 51.5. A reading above
50 indicates expansion.  China’s report “affirms their tightening of monetary
policy is taking effect and impacting oil demand,” said Serene Lim, a commodity strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. in  Singapore . “China is where the growth is and
having this kind of manufacturing activity data slowing down
might be affecting the markets.”  A report today may show U.S. manufacturing also slowed last
month. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell
to 52 from 53.5 in May, according to the median estimate of 77
economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Oil dropped early yesterday after the Labor Department
reported that U.S. jobless claims fell less than expected in the
week ended June 25. Claims slid by 1,000 to 428,000, compared
with the median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News
survey of a drop to 420,000.  IEA Release  IEA members will release 60 million barrels of oil from
strategic reserves over 30 days beginning at the end of this
week to make up for a Libyan production shortfall and curb high
prices, the agency said June 23. Half the crude will come from
the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  The U.S. offered light, sweet crude as part of the release.
More than “90 offers to purchase oil were received” on June
29, the Energy Department said yesterday. Contracts will be
completed by July 11, the agency said. The administration will
continue to monitor oil supply and is prepared to act further,
according to a government official.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’
production rose by an average 210,000 barrels a day in June to
29.105 million, the highest since February, a Bloomberg News
survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts showed.  Saudi
Arabia  increased crude output by 3.2 percent to a 32-month high.
Daily output by the 11 members with quotas, all except  Iraq ,
climbed 180,000 barrels to 26.4 million, 1.555 million barrels
above their target.  Oil Survey  Oil futures will probably fall next week amid signals that
the economy is slowing as the first oil from strategic reserves
enters the market, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Fourteen of 36 analysts, or 39 percent, forecast oil will
drop through July 8. Eight respondents, or 22 percent, predicted
prices will increase and 14 estimated there will be little
change. Last week, 44 percent of those surveyed said futures
would drop.  August oil in New York faces resistance at about $96.05,
the 200-day moving average, and $96.20, the middle of a
Bollinger chart, according to  Addison Armstrong , director of
market research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Nymex crude, trading above its 55-week moving average amid
a gain this week, will resume declines should prices fall below
support levels at about $89, according to Citigroup Inc.  Crude has “decent support” at $89.07 to $90 a barrel,
technical analysts  Tom Fitzpatrick , Shyam Devani and Alex Good
said in a report dated yesterday. That range is where the bottom
of an ascending channel coincides with the 55-week moving
average and the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement of oil’s rally
from last year’s low, the analysts said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
