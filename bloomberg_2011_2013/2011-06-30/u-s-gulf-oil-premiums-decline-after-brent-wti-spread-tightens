Gulf crude oil grades weakened as
the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent narrowed a day
after the Energy Department closed the auction for bids on
emergency oil stockpiles it plans to release.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart decreased
57 cents to $17.06 a barrel as of 4 p.m. in New York. When Brent
gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S.
grades that compete with West African oil priced against the
European benchmark.  The department closed bids yesterday on 30 million barrels
of mostly light, sweet, crude from storage facilities along the
Gulf of Mexico, half of a planned 60 million-barrel release
coordinated by the  International Energy Agency .  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium fell 20 cents to $13.60 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 3:51 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
lost 30 cents to $13.60 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 80 cents to $8.60 a barrel, while Poseidon lost
40 cents to $8.10 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium held at $7.25 a barrel over
WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $1.40.  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$20.50 a barrel, and Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $7.75.  To contact the reporter on this story:
