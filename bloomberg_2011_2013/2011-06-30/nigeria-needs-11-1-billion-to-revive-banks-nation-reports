Nigeria’s financial industry needs
1.7 trillion naira ($11.1 billion) to revive the country’s
banking system, the  Nation  reported, citing the deputy governor
of the central bank, Kingsley Moghalu.  The money will come from a fund financed by the nation’s 24
lenders and the central bank, rather than the Treasury, the
Lagos-based newspaper cited Moghalu as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
