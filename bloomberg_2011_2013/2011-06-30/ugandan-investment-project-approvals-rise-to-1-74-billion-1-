Uganda  approved investment projects
worth $1.74 billion in the 12 months through June, up from $1.55
billion a year earlier, said Aston Kajara, minister of state for
finance.  Investment was focused on the country’s electricity, gas,
finance and insurance industries, Kajara told reporters in the
capital, Kampala, today.  A total of 337 projects were approved, capable of creating
130,732 jobs, compared with 340 projects with planned employment
of 83,569 jobs in 2009-10, he said. Domestic investors accounted
for 66 percent of proposals, while  India  was the leading foreign
investor, with $149 million in spending plans.  The electricity and gas industries attracted $445 million
in investment, Kajara said. Uganda will become  Africa ’s latest
oil producer when Tullow Oil Plc, China National Offshore Oil
Corp. and Total SA begin production in 2012.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
