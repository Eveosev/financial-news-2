Seeds imported from  Egypt  may have
played a role in the E. coli outbreak that has infected more
than 4,000 people in France and  Germany , European health
authorities said.  “The tracing back is progressing and has thus far shown
that fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt either in 2009 and/or
2010 are implicated in both outbreaks,” the European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control and the European Food Safety
Authority said yesterday in a joint  report . Fenugreek, an herb,
is a common ingredient in curries.  No bacteriological tests have confirmed the imported seeds
as the cause of all the infections, so there is still “much
uncertainty” about their role, the health officials said. The
link to the Egyptian seeds doesn’t explain the most recent E.
coli case in  Sweden , in which sprouts weren’t consumed, they
said.  The E. coli outbreak that began in Germany in May has
caused illness in 4,077 people and  killed 48  in 13 European
countries, the ECDC said today.  Some of the 16 cases reported in France this month have
been linked to sprouts served in food at an event in Begles,
near  Bordeaux , on June 8. The European agencies advised
consumers not to grow sprouts for their own use or to eat
sprouts or sprouted seeds unless they have been thoroughly
cooked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
