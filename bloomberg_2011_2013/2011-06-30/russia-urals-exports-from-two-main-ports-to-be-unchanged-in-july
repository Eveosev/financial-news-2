Russia’s two largest oil export
facilities will keep combined daily shipments of Urals crude in
July unchanged from this month at 2.2 million barrels, according
to a final loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 55 cargoes of 100,000 metric tons each will be
exported from Primorsk on the  Baltic Sea  in July, one less than
the preliminary plan released on June 27. That’s equivalent to
1.3 million barrels a day, down 8.2 percent from this month.  Urals exports from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will be 35
shipments totaling 3.806 million tons, or 899,935 barrels a day,
15 percent more than this month. This compares with 3.795
million tons in the provisional schedule.  The world’s largest oil producer plans to export 13 cargoes
of East Siberian Pacific Ocean pipeline crude, or ESPO, from the
Far East port of Kozmino near the city of Nakhodka in July,
unchanged from this month and 14 lots in August, the plan
showed. Each shipment is 100,000 tons.  Exports of Siberian Light crude will be four consignments
totaling 290,000 tons from Tuapse on the  Black Sea , compared
with 450,000 tons this month, the plan showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
