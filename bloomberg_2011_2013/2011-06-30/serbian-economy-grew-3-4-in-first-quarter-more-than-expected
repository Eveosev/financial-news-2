Serbia’s economy expanded more than
expected in the first quarter, led by transportation, energy,
manufacturing and financial services.  Gross domestic product grew 3.4 percent, double the pace in
the final three months of the last year, the Statistics Office
said today. The result beat the office’s flash estimate of 3
percent and was higher than the 2.4 percent increase expected by
the central bank. The  International Monetary Fund  sees the
economy expanding 3 percent this year and 4.5 percent in 2012.  Serbia is emerging from its first recession since 1999,
when NATO bombing aimed at forcing the country’s troops out of
 Kosovo  destroyed most of its infrastructure. The nation relied
on a 3 billion-euro ($4.3 billion) bailout loan from the IMF
since mid-2009, when the global financial crisis triggered a
flight of capital. The government is negotiating a new $1
billion IMF loan.  Industrial production rose 6.8 percent in May from a year
earlier after 0.7 percent increase in April, the office said in
a separate statement. It was led by a 32.1 percent expansion in
mining and quarrying, a 19.1 percent increase in electricity and
gas production and 2.6 percent growth in manufacturing
industries, the office said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
