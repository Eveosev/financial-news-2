Russia ’s Micex Index advanced for a
third day after the U.S. government said oil supplies dropped
almost three times as much as expected last week, spurring
demand for Russia’s chief export earner.  The 30-stock Micex gauge added 0.2 percent to 1,662.8 as of
11:35 a.m. in Moscow, trimming its decline this quarter to 8.3
percent. Oil producers OAO Rosneft and OAO Gazprom Neft climbed
0.8 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index gained 0.6 percent to 1,906.24.  Oil, Russia’s chief export revenue earner, increased after
the Energy Department announced crude inventories declined by
4.38 million barrels in the week ended June 24, more than the
1.5 million median forecast of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
News. Crude for August delivery gained as much as 67 cents a
barrel, and last traded little changed at $94.75 a barrel.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
