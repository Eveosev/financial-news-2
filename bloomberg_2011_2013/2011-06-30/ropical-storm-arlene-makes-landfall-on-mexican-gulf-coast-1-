Tropical Storm Arlene, the first
cyclone of the 2011 Atlantic storm season, made landfall today
on the  Gulf Coast  of  Mexico , according to the National Hurricane
Center.  The storm is moving toward the west at a speed of almost 8
miles (13 kilometers) per hour, the  Miami-based agency  said in
an advisory at 7 a.m. central daylight time.  The Mexican government issued a hurricane warning for the
east coast from Barra de Nautla northward to  La Cruz , the center
said. The storm is about 45 miles north of Tuxpan, Mexico, with
maximum sustained winds at near 65 mph, it said.  “Arlene is expected to continue moving inland over
mainland Mexico today.” A storm becomes a hurricane when winds
reach 74 mph.  “Weakening is forecast today, and Arlene is expected to
dissipate on Friday,” the center said. “The  hurricane warning 
will likely be discontinued later this morning.”  About 200,000 people spread across the states of Veracruz,
Tamaulipas, Hidalgo, Puebla, Queretaro and San Luis Potosi are
vulnerable to the impacts of Arlene, according to a statement
posted on the  website  of Mexico’s Interior Ministry.  In Veracruz, Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa asked for the
central government to declare a state of emergency in order to
access disaster funding, according to a  statement  on the state
website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
