Billionaire investor  Carl Icahn  in a
 filing  said he owned 9.5 percent of  Oshkosh Corp. (OSK) , the U.S.
military’s biggest supplier of armored trucks, and sought talks
with the company to enhance  shareholder value .  Following Icahn’s announcement, Oshkosh rose 8.3 percent in
New York trading after closing at $28.94. The shares had
declined 17.9 percent this year. The Standard & Poor’s
Supercomposite Aerospace & Defense Index has gained 11.7 percent
in the same period.  Oshkosh, based in the city of the same name in Wisconsin,
reported 2010 sales of $9.8 billion. The company’s defense
revenue nearly quadrupled to $7.2 billion last year from $1.9
billion in 2008 largely because of the military’s demand for
mine-resistant trucks for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The
company’s fire, emergency, construction and trash-hauling trucks
accounted for 37 percent of sales last year.  In a June 16 interview Chief Executive Officer Charles Szews said the company may seek acquisitions to boost growth
starting in 2012.  “We do not see any acquisitions in 2011, but starting in
2012 and ‘13, we will at that point reconsider,” Szews said.
With a “downturn” anticipated in U.S. defense spending, the
price of defense companies may start to look “more
attractive,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
