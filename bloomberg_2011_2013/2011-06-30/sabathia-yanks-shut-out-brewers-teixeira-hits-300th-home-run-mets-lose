C.C. Sabathia tied a career high
with 13 strikeouts and Mark Teixeira hit the 300th home run of
his career as the New York Yankees beat the visiting Milwaukee
Brewers 5-0.  Catcher Francisco Cervelli was 3-for-4 with two runs batted
in, and Teixeira hit his 25th home run of the season in the
third inning as the Yankees won their fifth consecutive game and
ninth in the last 11. The three-game sweep of the Brewers at
Yankee Stadium was the team’s sixth of the Major League Baseball
season, equaling last year’s total.  Sabathia, who spent half of the 2008 season in Milwaukee,
earned his league-leading 11th victory against four losses,
working 7 2/3 innings. The 30-year-old left-hander has a 3.25
earned-run average with 93 strikeouts this season.  The victory keeps the first-place Yankees 2 1/2 games ahead
of the Boston Red Sox in the American League East standings. The
Red Sox got a pair of home runs from catcher Jason Varitek
and seven scoreless innings from Jon Lester to beat the host
Philadelphia Phillies 5-2 this afternoon.  Justin Verlander also got his 11th win of the season as the
Detroit Tigers beat the visiting New York Mets at Comerica Park.
The Mets, who scored 52 runs in their previous four games, had
10 hits, their lowest total since a June 24 loss to the Texas
Rangers. Verlander, who pitched his second career no-hitter on
May 7, gave up one run over seven innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
