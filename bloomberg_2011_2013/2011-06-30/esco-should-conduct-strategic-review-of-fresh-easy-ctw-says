Tesco Plc (TSCO) ’s incoming chairman
Richard Broadbent should conduct a strategic review of its
unprofitable U.S. chain Fresh & Easy, a pension advisory firm
said.  Tesco, the U.K.’s largest grocer, needs to outline a
strategy for profitability at the unit,  CTW Investment Group ,
which advises U.S. union-sponsored pension funds with more than
$200 billion in assets, said in a statement today.  The Washington-based group said Broadbent, who takes over
as chairman from David Reid on Nov. 30, should undertake the
review because the existing approach is “notably
unsuccessful.” The firm also said changes made to Tesco’s
executive compensation policy meant that it no longer links the
pay of U.S. Chief Executive Officer Tim Mason to the
“performance of the U.S. business in any meaningful way.”  A spokesman for Cheshunt, England-based Tesco, said CTW is
not a shareholder, and doesn’t speak for them.  Tesco rose 4.25 pence, or 1.1 percent, to 402 pence today
in  London  trading. The shares have declined 5.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
