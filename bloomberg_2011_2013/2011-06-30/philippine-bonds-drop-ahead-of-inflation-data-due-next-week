Philippine bonds had their biggest
quarterly gain since the three months ended September as the
government said it aimed to narrow the budget deficit.  The peso rose the most since June 21 as Budget
Undersecretary Laura Pascua said the nation will target a
shortfall of 2.6 percent of gross domestic product next year,
from a goal of 3 percent this year. Bonds rallied for a third
day as Budget Secretary Butch Abad said today the government may
consider pushing for new taxes after 2011.  “The budget deficit forecast for 2012 is better,” said
Yvette Marquez-Carlos, who helps manage the equivalent of $11
billion at BPI Asset Management in  Manila . “That’s positive
news.”  The yield on the 9.125 percent notes due September 2016
fell 72 basis points this quarter to 5.08 percent as of 4:28
a.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
rate dropped two basis points today and 29 basis points this
month.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 43.333 per dollar,
according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency dropped 0.1 percent this month, paring its gain
this quarter to 0.2 percent.  President  Benigno Aquino , who completes his first year in
office this month, has gone after tax evaders and corrupt
officials to narrow the budget gap from a record 314.5 billion
pesos ($7.3 billion) in 2010.  Fitch Ratings  raised the country’s debt to one step below
investment grade on June 23. Moody’s Investors Service upgraded
the  Philippines  to the highest rating since the start of 2005 on
June 15.  To contact the reporter for this story:
