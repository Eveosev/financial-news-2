Argentina central bank President
Mercedes Marco del Pont said the institution won’t allow the
peso to appreciate.  “A big part of our historical failures was the trap of
using the appreciation of our currency as a way to control our
internal prices,” said Marco del Pont today in a central bank
seminar in  Buenos Aires . “We have to seek alternatives to
discuss these tensions without giving up growth and social
inclusion.”  The Argentine peso declined 0.1 percent to 4.1080 to the
dollar yesterday. The currency has fallen 3.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
