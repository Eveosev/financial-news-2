The lira strengthened against the
dollar, extending this week’s advance, as  Greece  moved closer to
avoiding default.  The lira appreciated 0.8 percent to 1.6103 per dollar at
5:14 a.m. in Istanbul, extending this week’s gain to 1.6
percent. Two-year benchmark bonds rose, with yields falling nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 9.09 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Euro-area finance ministers are set to approve the next aid
payment due to Greece and outline a second rescue after banks
lined up behind debt-rollover plans. The endorsements by
Greece’s creditors and parliament met European Union conditions
for preventing a default.  “I believe that the Greek crisis has been solved and will
not bother us for a long time,”Suha Yaygin, deputy chief of
emerging markets at Toronto-Dominion Bank in  London , wrote in e-
mailed comments.  The lira has gained 2 percent since hiting a two-year low
against the dollar on June 28 after Greek lawmakers approved a
budget-cutting package this week. The currency slumped 4.8
percent in the second-quarter, the worst performance among more
than 20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There will be a summer rally and  Turkey  will be among the
ones to benefit the most because of the recent losses,” Yaygin
said.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  fell 0.01 percent to 63,264.51.
It has advanced 1.9 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
