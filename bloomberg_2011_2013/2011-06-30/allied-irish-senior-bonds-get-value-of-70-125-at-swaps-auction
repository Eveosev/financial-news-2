Sellers of default insurance on
 Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  will have to pay 89.625 cents on the euro
to settle contracts linked to the lender’s subordinated debt.  Credit-default swaps traders set a  recovery value  of 10.375
percent at an auction today for the lender’s junior debt and
70.125 percent for its senior bonds, according to administrators
Markit Group Ltd. and Creditex Group Inc.  Allied Irish default swaps are being settled because the
nationalized lender skipped payments on subordinated bonds this
month, triggering a failure-to-pay  credit event  on all swaps.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a company
fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
