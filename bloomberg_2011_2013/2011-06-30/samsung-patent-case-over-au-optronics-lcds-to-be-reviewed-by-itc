Samsung Electronics Co.â€™s patent-
infringement claims over  AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  liquid crystal
displays will be reviewed by the U.S. International Trade
Commission.  The complaint filed June 1 seeks a U.S. import ban of LCD
computer monitors and televisions, and names AU customers  Acer
Inc. (2353) , BenQ Corp. and Sanyo Electric Co. The Washington-based
trade agency today  said  it has begun the investigation into the
claims. A review typically takes 15 to 18 months.  AU Optronics, based in Hsinchu,  Taiwan , filed its own
complaint at the ITC on June 27 over flat-panel display devices.
That case names customers of Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung,
including AT&T Inc., Best Buy Co. and BrandSmart USA Inc.  AU and Samsung also have filed civil lawsuits against each
other, seeking cash compensation for what they claim is
unauthorized use of their inventions.  The new case is In the Matter of Liquid Crystal Display
Devices, 337-782, U.S. International Trade Commission
( Washington ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
