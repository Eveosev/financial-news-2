AMC Entertainment Inc., Landmark
Theatres and Camera Cinemas refused to honor a Netflix-style
monthly pass to their theaters, saying they weren’t informed of
a trial of the MoviePass service in  San Francisco  this weekend.  MoviePass, based in  New York , had been advertising a $50-a-
month trial offering users one movie a day, and said on its
 website  the service would start this weekend in the three
chains’ San Francisco-area theaters. References to the test were
removed after Kansas City, Missouri-based AMC and Los Angeles-
based Landmark said they wouldn’t participate.  E-mails and calls to a number listed on the MoviePass
website weren’t immediately returned. The test was arranged
through ticketing companies and not through the theater chains,
the website TheWrap.com reported.  “We continue to evaluate the MoviePass program,” Joel
Cohen, chief executive officer of MovieTickets.com, said in an
e-mail. “However, we stand behind and support our theater
partners and will always ensure our goals and interests are
aligned with exhibition.”  AMC, the second-largest U.S. theater chain, wasn’t
consulted about the MoviePass test, and won’t honor tickets,
according to a statement today from the exhibitor.  Camera Cinemas will turn away customers who attempt to use
the pass, Dominic Espinosa, director of operations, said in an
interview. The company wasn’t contacted and hadn’t heard of
MoviePass until seeing press accounts of the trial, he said.  Landmark Theatres also wasn’t informed and will try to
prevent the tickets from being offered, TheWrap.com reported,
citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Ted Mundorff.  Netflix, based in  Los Gatos ,  California , offers a
subscription-based movie streaming and DVD rental service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
