Cyprus’s fiscal deficit in the first
five months of the year more than doubled, to 2.7 percent of
economic output from 1.2 percent a year earlier, mainly because
of higher spending, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The deficit in cash terms widened to 497.5 million euros
($720 million) from 200.2 million euros, the ministry said in a
 statement  on its website today.  Public spending rose 12 percent in the period, to 2.9
billion euros, mainly on a 64 percent increase in interest
payments and an 11 percent increase in other current transfers,
the statement said. Overall revenue rose 0.5 percent to 2.4
billion euros.  The island’s primary deficit, which excludes debt-interest
payments, widened to 290.5 million euros, from 74.3 million
euros, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
