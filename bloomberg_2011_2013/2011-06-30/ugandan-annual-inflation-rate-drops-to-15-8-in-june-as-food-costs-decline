Inflation in  Uganda , where protests
erupted in April over the rising cost of living, slowed from its
highest level in 17 years in June as food prices declined.  The annual inflation rate fell to 15.8 percent from 16
percent in May, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics said today in a
statement handed to reporters in the capital, Kampala. Prices
climbed 0.1 percent in the month.  Food price inflation slowed by 2.5 percentage points in the
month as a decline in the costs of bananas, pineapples and beans
offset higher charges for bread and corn flour, the agency said.  The annual inflation rate for non-food items rose to 20.3
percent from 19.5 percent in May, it said. The underlying annual
inflation rate, which excludes food, fuel, electricity and
metered-water costs, climbed to 12.2 percent in June from 11.3
percent in May, the bureau said.  Uganda, with a population of more than 31.7 million people
and a $16 billion economy, according to the  World Bank , is
 Africa â€™s second-largest coffee producer, after Ethiopia, and the
biggest robusta coffee producer on the continent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
