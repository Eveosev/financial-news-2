Three members of Jordan’s parliament
resigned and another 54 said they will boycott house sessions in
a dispute over an abandoned plan to build a casino in the Muslim
country, Petra said.  The lawmakers were protesting a parliamentary vote on June
27 which cleared Prime Minister  Marouf Bakhit , who was in the
post at the time of the casino plan in 2007, and several ex-
ministers of responsibility for the failed project. Parliament
voted to send one former minister to be tried at a special
tribunal in connection with the case, the Jordan Times reported
today.  The Islamic Action Front, the kingdom’s largest opposition
party, says Bakhit and the former ministers were involved in the
project, and called for the resignation of his government. It
should be replaced with a “national salvation government,” the
party, a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood,  said  on its website.  Jordan’s opposition has staged demonstrations this year to
demand reform and an end to corruption, inspired by pro-
democracy revolts in Tunisia and  Egypt . Their protests, which
did not demand the overthrow of the monarchy, were sometimes
violently broken up by security forces.  King Abdullah  responded by appointing Bakhit to head a new
administration. He promised on June 12 to ease restrictions on
political parties and allow the formation of governments based
on a parliamentary majority, without saying when it will happen.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the reporter on this story:
