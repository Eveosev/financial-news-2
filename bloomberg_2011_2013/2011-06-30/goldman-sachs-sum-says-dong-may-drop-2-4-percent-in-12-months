Shirla Sum, an economist at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in  Hong Kong , comments on the outlook for the
Vietnamese dong in a research note released today. The U.S. bank
forecasts the dong will weaken 1.4 percent to 20,900 per dollar
in six months and 2.4 percent to 21,100 in 12 months.  “Persistently high inflation has resulted in the
depreciation of the dong, which in turn feeds into imported
price pressures and worsened inflationary expectations.  “We do not expect another sharp nominal devaluation of the
dong in the near term. Given the current inflation and external
position dynamics, we believe a tighter monetary policy stance
to tackle inflation head-on is a much more viable policy option
than another one-off devaluation, which can in turn exacerbate
the inflation problem.”  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
