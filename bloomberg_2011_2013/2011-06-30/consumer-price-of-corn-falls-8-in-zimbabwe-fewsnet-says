The consumer price of corn fell 8
percent in May compared with the previous month after farmers
began harvesting the crop, the Famine Early Warning Systems
Network, known as Fewsnet, said in an e-mailed statement from
Harare today.  Consumers are paying $0.32 a kilogram for the crop, which
is the southern African nationâ€™s staple food, Fewsnet said. The
famine warning unit is partly funded by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
