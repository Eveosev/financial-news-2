Ethanol futures plunged the most in
19 months in  Chicago  after a government report showed an
unexpected increase in corn supply that would cut production
costs for the biofuel.  The grain-based gasoline additive fell 6.5 percent after
the Agriculture Department said corn inventories remaining from
last year’s harvest totaled 3.67 billion bushels as of June 1,
compared with a forecast of 3.29 billion bushels by analysts in
a Bloomberg News survey.  “Ethanol is overreacting to the corn,” said Jim Damask, a
manager at BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based
alternative energy broker. “It’s a bloodbath out here. It’s
their main production cost.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery fell 17.8 cents to
settle at $2.555 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
steepest decline since December 2009.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  sank 12.5
cents, or 4.4 percent, to $2.735 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive plummeted 12.5 cents, or 4.5 percent, to $2.64,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast dipped 7.5 cents, or 2.6 percent,
to $2.79 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel dropped 2.5
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.75.  Corn futures for December delivery fell the exchange limit
of 30 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $6.205 a bushel in Chicago. One
bushel can make at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
