Edison SpA (EDN)  signed a joint-venture
agreement with  Elektroprivreda Srbije ,  Serbia ’s dominant power
company, to invest in the Kolubara B thermal plant.  Edison of  Italy  will have 63.6 percent of the future 750-
megawatt coal-fired facility, while EPS will own the remaining
36.4 percent, the Serbian company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Edison’s investment wasn’t given. Earlier estimates put
the cost of completing Kolubara B at more than 1 billion euros
($1.45 billion). The plant’s construction began in 1988 and was
suspended in the 1990s for a lack of funds.  The preliminary contract is the “foundation for joint
activities that practically begin immediately,” the statement
said.  A feasibility study for the plant is expected in the first
quarter of 2012 after which the two companies will form the
joint company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
