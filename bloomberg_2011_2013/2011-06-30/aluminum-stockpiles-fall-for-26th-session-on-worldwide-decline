Aluminum stockpiles tracked by the
 London  Metal Exchange fell for a 26th session, dropping in
warehouses from the U.S. to Malaysia.  Inventories of the lightweight metal slid 10,300 metric
tons to 4.50 million tons, the lowest level since Jan. 20, LME
data showed today. The streak of declines is the longest since
Aug. 26, 2004. Stockpiles have dropped 4.4 percent since May 24,
according to exchange figures.  “What will be interesting to see is whether the recent
outflows are followed by similar large inflows over the next
couple of weeks, suggesting material is being shifted about
rather than being consumed,”  Leon Westgate , a Standard Bank Plc
analyst in London, said in a report yesterday.  Orders to remove aluminum from warehouses, or canceled
warrants, fell 9,900 tons to 448,500 tons. The orders have
dropped 15 percent since June 6, when they reached the highest
level since at least October 1997, led by gains in  Asia .  “The aluminum canceled is not against demand,” said Nick Riley, head of LME sales at Marex Financial Ltd., one of 12
companies on the exchange’s floor. “A lot of that movement in
the  Far East  is all one warehouse moving to another warehouse,”
he said, adding that stockpiles of other metals also were being
shifted.  Fivefold Jump  Tin inventories increased 165 tons to 22,150 tons on a gain
in  Singapore , while canceled warrants were little changed at
2,615 tons. The orders jumped fivefold on June 28 to the highest
level since April 2010, led by a surge in Singapore.  Zinc stockpiles fell for a fifth day to 863,475 tons as
canceled warrants slid 350 tons to 49,175 tons. The orders rose
yesterday to the highest level since September, driven by gains
in Port Klang,  Malaysia .  Lead canceled warrants fell 2,575 tons to 36,650 tons after
rising to the highest since at least October 1997 on June 27.
Inventories declined 2,375 tons to 320,300 tons on declines in
Singapore and Port Klang.  Copper stockpiles dropped 1,775 tons to 465,250 tons.
Canceled warrants, which reached the highest level in 11 months
last week, fell 1,975 tons to 22,600 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
