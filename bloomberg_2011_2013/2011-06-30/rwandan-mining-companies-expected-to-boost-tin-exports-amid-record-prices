Tin producers in  Rwanda  including
Rutongo Mines Ltd., the country’s biggest miner of the tin ore
cassiterite, plan to boost exports as the East African nation
seeks to gain from record prices for the metal, officials said.  Rutongo expects to double shipments to 200 metric tons a
month by the end of 2012 from 100 tons currently, Michael
Biryabarema, general director of the Rwanda Geology and Mines
Authority said in a phone interview on June 28. The company, a
joint venture between Rwanda’s government and Switzerland-based
Ruddington Services AG, has increased exports from 3 tons a
month three years ago, he said.  “They projected by the end of next year they would be at
200 tons,” Biryabarema said. “From their output, you cannot
doubt their projections,” he said, without providing current
production data.  Rwanda is boosting revenue from mining as the nation
rebuilds its economy that was decimated by a genocide in 1994 in
which at least 800,000 people died. The country, which earns
most of its foreign exchange from tourism and coffee exports,
doubled the size of its economy in the nine years to 2010,
according to the  World Bank .  Three-month delivery tin rose 0.2 percent to $25,900 a ton
at 12:44 p.m. on the London Metal Exchange. The metal, which
traded at a record $33,600 a ton on April 11, has gained 49
percent over the past 12 months. Tin may trade at $23,000 to
$27,000 a metric ton in the second half of this year as demand
from  Japan  remains weak after an earthquake and tsunami in
March, according to PT Timah, the world’s biggest exporter.  Tungsten Exports  Wolfram Mining & Processing Ltd., a Kigali-based miner of
cassiterite and wolframite, also known as tungsten, plans to
boost its shipments of both metals to as much as 65 tons a month
before the end of this year, from 36 tons this month, said Jean-
Malic Kalima, a director at the company. Wolfram is owned by
private investors in Rwanda, Austria and  Switzerland , Kalima
said, without providing more details.  Tin is used in electrical solder and to coat steel, while
tungsten is used in light bulbs.  Rwandan exports of minerals more than doubled to $50.1
million in the five months through May, from $20.7 million in
the same period the year earlier, according to the Natural
Resources Ministry. Volumes grew to 2,775 tons from 1,917 tons
in 2009, the ministry said in a document handed to Bloomberg.  Mineral Exports  Rwanda’s annual exports of cassiterite, wolframite and
coltan, an ore containing tantalum which is used in mobile
phones and video-game consoles, may climb to $256 million by
2015 from $96.4 million as companies boost production, Natural
Resources Minister Stanislas Kamanzi said in an interview on
June 23.  “It’s clear that the reserves are there and the business is
good,” he said.  About 92 percent of Rwanda’s mines have installed
traceability systems as of April 1 in accordance with the U.S.
Dodd-Frank Act that is intended to curb the trade of minerals
that fund conflict, Kamanzi said. The industry employs 35,000
people in the country, he said.  Rwanda’s government is looking to address obstacles faced
by mining companies to increase investment, including the high
cost of electricity, Kamanzi said. Rwanda produces 95 megawatts
of power, which is enough for 14 percent of the population,
according to the Infrastructure Ministry. The government is
currently seeking investors for projects that may increase
output to 1,000 megawatts before 2018.  “There is an urgent need for electricity,” Rwandan
President  Paul Kagame  told reporters in Kigali on June 23. “One
hundred megawatts is not enough. We want more.”  Rwanda borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
 Africa ’s biggest tin producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
