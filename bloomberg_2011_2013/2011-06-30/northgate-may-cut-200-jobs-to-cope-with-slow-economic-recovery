Northgate Plc (NTG) , the biggest provider
of leased vans in  Spain  and the U.K., plans to cut 200 jobs this
year as it reorganizes its business to cope with a subdued
economic recovery.  “We are planning on the basis there will be less activity
in the U.K.,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Contreras said in an
interview. “I don’t think we have seen the true impact of
public-sector spending cuts come through yet.”  The U.K. is starting the biggest squeeze on state spending
since World War II to curb the public deficit. Spain is imposing
the toughest austerity measures in three decades to convince
investors it can avoid a European Union bailout.  Northgate’s net income in the year ended April 30 rose 20
percent to 29.4 million pounds ($47 million), or 21.7 pence a
share, from 24.4 million pounds, or 22.8 pence, a year earlier.
While revenue declined 4.7 percent to 537.3 million pounds,
costs fell faster.  The shares rose as much as 3.3 percent in London trading,
the most in eight weeks, and were up 8.8 pence, or 2.8 percent,
at 318.6 pence at 9:10 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
