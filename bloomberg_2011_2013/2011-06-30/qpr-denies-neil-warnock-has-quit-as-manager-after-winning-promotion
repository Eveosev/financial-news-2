Queens Park Rangers said manager
Neil Warnock hasn’t quit and is preparing the club for its
return to the Premier League.  The west  London  soccer club issued a statement on its
website to dispel “rumors circulating today” that Warnock
stepped down.  “The club would like to make it clear that Neil Warnock
has not resigned from his post and is continuing to work hard
behind the scenes ahead of the Rs’ return to pre-season training
next week,” the  statement  read.  Since QPR earned promotion to the Premier League by winning
the second-tier Championship, there’s been speculation over
Warnock’s future. Italian coaches Claudio Ranieri, Marcello Lippi and  Carlo Ancelotti  have been linked in U.K. media reports
with QPR, while Warnock was mentioned as a candidate for the
West Ham manager’s post filled by  Sam Allardyce  this month.  “With regards to my own situation, I’m really excited
about the challenge that lies ahead next season and I can’t wait
for pre-season training next week,” Warnock said in the club’s
statement.  QPR, which last played in the Premier League in 1996, opens
the season at home against Bolton Wanderers on Aug. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
