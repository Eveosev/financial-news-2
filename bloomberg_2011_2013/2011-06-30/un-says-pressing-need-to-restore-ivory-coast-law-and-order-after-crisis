Ivory Coast , the West African nation
recovering from a violent post-election crisis, has a “pressing
need to restore law and order,” said Young-jin Choi, the  United
Nations ’ special representative in the country.  The UN mission in Ivory Coast will set up eight new
military camps in the west of the country before the end of
July, Choi told reporters in Abidjan, the commercial capital,
today. They will also help the Ivorian government, now led by
President  Alassane Ouattara , rehabilitate police stations and
other offices at a cost of 2 billion  CFA francs  ($4.4 million),
he said.  As many as 3,000 people may have died after Ivory Coast’s
November presidential election, according to the International
Criminal Court, which is investigating alleged crimes by
supporters of both Ouattara and ex-President Laurent Gbagbo, who
refused to cede power after losing the vote. Gbagbo was captured
in Abidjan on April 11 and Ouattara inaugurated on May 21.  Ivory Coast ’s administration should deploy police and
gendarmerie throughout the country and ensure that “army
elements” return to their barracks, Choi said.  Ivory Coast has to “prepare in earnest” for legislative
elections, which may be held before the end of the year, Choi
said. The country needs to appoint an electoral commission and
work on its list of registered voters, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
