Spain  will raise electricity tariffs
for about 20 million homes by 1.5 percent on average as of
tomorrow, Efe reported, citing unidentified people in the
government.  The rate increase, which reflects more expensive energy
costs, means the average consumer will pay about 50 cents
($0.72) more a month, the newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
