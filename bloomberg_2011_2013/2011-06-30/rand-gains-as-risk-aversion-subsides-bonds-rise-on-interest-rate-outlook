The rand rose against the dollar for
a fourth day as chances of a default by  Greece  subsided,
boosting demand for riskier assets. Bonds gained as credit and
inflation data spurred bets rates won’t rise this year.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest economy appreciated as
much as 1.1 percent to 6.7527 per dollar, and traded 0.8 percent
stronger at 6.7703 as of 4:02 p.m. in Johannesburg, paring its
decline against the dollar in the first six months to 2.4
percent, the only one to retreat out of 16 major currencies
monitored by Bloomberg. The rand climbed 0.4 percent to 9.8020
per euro, paring its drop versus the 17-nation currency in the
first six months to 9.4 percent.  Emerging-market stocks rallied to a three-week high, metal
prices increased for a third day and the euro strengthened
against the dollar after Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
won parliamentary support for budget cuts. German banks have
agreed to roll over at least 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) of
Greek debt holdings, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble 
said today. South African stocks climbed to the highest since
June 2.  “Risk appetite has returned and boosted the performance of
equity markets and emerging-market currencies alike,” Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a research note. “The dollar finds itself
firmly on the defensive.”  Forty-five percent of  South Africa ’s exports are bought
with euros.  “It’s only this morning that the positive sentiment is
starting to be reflected, with euro-dollar breaking past 1.45
and dollar-rand into the 6.70s,”  John Cairns  and Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, wrote in a research note.  Household Borrowing  The rand pared its gain after South African credit data for
May prompted traders to reduce bets on an interest-rate increase
this year. Borrowing by households and businesses rose an annual
5.2 percent, down from 6.2 percent in April, the  Reserve Bank 
said on its website today. The median estimate of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 6.3 percent.  Forward-rate agreements effective in November, which
investors use to lock in interest rates, dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 5.94 percent today. The
contracts were as high as 6.05 percent two weeks ago.  The credit and producer-price data “reinforce our view
that the first increase in  interest rates  will occur only in the
first quarter of 2012,” Nomvuyo Guma, a Johannesburg-based
analyst at Standard Bank Group Ltd., Africa’s biggest rand
trader, said in a research note. “This could be seen as rand
negative from an interest-rate differential standpoint.”  Bonds  Bonds advanced for the first day in three. The 13.5 percent
notes due 2015 jumped 8 cents to 121.31 rand, driving the yield
down two basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.47
percent. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021 climbed 26 cents
to 89.18 rand, cutting the yield four basis points to 8.38
percent.  Foreign investors bought a net 1.66 billion rand ($245
million) of South African bonds yesterday, bringing their
purchases this quarter to 43 billion rand, according to JSE Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
