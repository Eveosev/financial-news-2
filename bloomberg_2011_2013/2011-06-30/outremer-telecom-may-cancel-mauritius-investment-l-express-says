Outremer Telecom (OMT)  SA may cancel its
plan to invest 1.6 billion rupees ($56 million) in  Mauritius ,
l’Express reported, citing Michel Rigot, the company’s general
manager for the country.  Outremer Telecom had applied for a third-generation mobile
license, which was denied, the Port Louis-based newspaper said.
The case was referred to court and no decision has been taken,
it reported. A third-generation, or 3G network, enables faster
data transmission and allows mobile-phone users to download
music and videos to their handsets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
