Okomu Oil Palm Plc (OKOMUOIL) , which says it
has  Nigeria ’s biggest oil-palm plantation, plans to spend “in
the region of 2 billion naira” ($13 million) to increase rubber
cultivation, said Managing Director Graham Hefer.  “We intend to expand with approximately 3,500 hectares of
rubber from 2012 through to 2015,” he said by phone today from
Okomu-Udo in Edo state, midwestern  Nigeria . Okomu will have
9,000 hectares under cultivation and double production capacity
from the current 2.5 tons of dry rubber per hour, he said.  Okomu, which has been producing  palm oil  for 35 years in
the West African nation, started a rubber-tree plantation 10
years ago, said Chairman Gbengea Oyebode. The addition created a
“significant” increase in the company’s profitability, he told
reporters in Lagos, the commercial capital, yesterday. Okomu
exports all the rubber it produces, he said.  Okomu has been adding an average of 5,000 hectares of oil-
palm trees a year, and the company “still has room for
growth,” Oyebode said.  Shares in the company have risen 6.7 percent this year,
compared with a 1 percent rise in the  Nigerian Stock Exchange ’s
All-Share Index. The stock was unchanged at 16 naira by the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
