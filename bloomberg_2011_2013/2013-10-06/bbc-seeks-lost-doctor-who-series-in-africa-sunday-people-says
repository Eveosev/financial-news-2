The  BBC  is in talks with Ethiopia’s
state broadcaster to recover 100 lost episodes of “Doctor Who”
first aired from 1964 to 1969, the Sunday People said, citing
Stuart Kelly, an expert on the science fiction series.  The British Broadcasting Corp. sold the episodes to the
Ethiopian Radio and Television Agency about 40 years ago and
subsequently lost the originals, the newspaper reported.  A group of Doctor Who fans tracked down the episodes to
Ethiopia, it said. The BBC, which still owns the copyright, may
secure the tapes before a 50th anniversary special is screened
on Nov. 23, the People said, citing the broadcaster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
