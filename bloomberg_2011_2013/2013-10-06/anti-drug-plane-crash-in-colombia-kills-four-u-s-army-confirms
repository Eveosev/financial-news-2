Three Americans and a Panamanian Air
National Guardsman were killed in a plane crash in northern
Colombia yesterday morning near the border of  Panama , the U.S.
Southern Command said in a statement.  Two Americans survived the crash in the remote jungle area
and were rescued by Colombian military forces and taken to a
hospital in Bogota.  The DH-8 aircraft was contracted by the U.S. government to
provide detection and monitoring of drug trafficking routes in
the coastal region of Central America as part of Operation
Martillo, according to the statement.  The plane lost communications over the Western Caribbean
before crashing near the city of Capurgana, with no indication
it was shot down.  “We express our sympathies to the families of the
deceased,” General John Kelly, commander of U.S. Southern
Command, said in the statement. “The U.S., Panama, Colombia,
and all of our partners in Operation Martillo remain committed
to our longstanding cooperative relationship for counter-narcotics operations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
