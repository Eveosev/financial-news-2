Peyton Manning  and the Denver Broncos
remained undefeated by pulling out a 51-48 road win against the
 Dallas Cowboys  in the fourth-highest scoring game in National
Football League history.  The Broncos scored 10 points in the final three minutes
yesterday in Arlington, Texas, including Matt Prater’s winning
28-yard field goal as time expired, to join the New Orleans
Saints and Kansas City Chiefs as the NFL’s only 5-0 teams.  Manning threw four touchdown passes and ran for his first
score in five years for the Broncos, who withstood a 506-yard,
five-touchdown performance by Cowboys quarterback  Tony Romo  to
collect their 16th straight regular season win. Romo had his
final pass attempt intercepted at Dallas’s 24-yard line with one
minute, 57 seconds left to set up Denver’s winning score.  “Their offense is hot, but we kept scoring and then had
the huge defensive play at the end,” said Manning, who had 414
passing yards. “We did not want to give them the ball back.”  Manning helped the Broncos record the second-highest point
total in franchise history -- behind their 52 points a week
earlier -- and has a record 20 touchdown passes in the Broncos’
5-0 start, breaking the previous mark of 18 set by Daunte Culpepper through the first five games of the 2004 season.  New Orleans and Kansas City also won on the road to improve
to 5-0, with the Saints beating the Chicago Bears 26-18 and the
Chiefs topping the Tennessee Titans 26-17.  First Losses  The  New England Patriots  and  Seattle Seahawks  had 4-0
records entering Week 5, yet both suffered their first losses.
The Patriots were beaten 13-6 at the Cincinnati Bengals as  Tom Brady  had his streak of 52 straight games with a touchdown pass
halted, while the Seahawks fell 34-28 in Indianapolis as Colts
quarterback  Andrew Luck  directed his ninth fourth-quarter
comeback in 21 career NFL games.  The  New York Giants  are 0-5 for the first time since 1987
after losing 36-21 to the  Philadelphia Eagles . Nick Foles threw
two fourth-quarter touchdown passes after replacing an injured
 Michael Vick  for the Eagles (2-3), who ended a three-game losing
skid. Eli Manning was intercepted three times in the final
quarter for the Giants, who blew a 21-19 lead.  The Jacksonville Jaguars are the NFL’s only other 0-5 team
after a 34-20 loss to the St. Louis Rams.  The Baltimore Ravens topped the Miami Dolphins 26-23 for
their first win in three road games this season. Justin Tucker
kicked a 44-yard field goal with one minute, 42 seconds left for
the Ravens (3-2), who held on for the win as Caleb Sturgis
missed a 57-yard attempt for the Dolphins (3-2).  Packers’ Streak  The Green Bay Packers (2-2) beat the Detroit Lions (3-2)
for the 23rd straight time in Wisconsin, winning 22-9 as  James Jones  hauled in an 83-yard touchdown catch. The San Francisco
49ers beat the Houston Texans 34-3 last night after intercepting
Matt Schaub three times and the Arizona Cardinals topped the
Carolina Panthers 22-6.  The Oakland Raiders (2-3) held on to defeat the San Diego
Chargers 27-17 as Charles Woodson scored his record 13th-defensive touchdown.  Philip Rivers  had his third 400-yeard
passing game of the season for the Chargers (2-3).  Week 5 play, which began with the Cleveland Browns (3-2)
beating the Buffalo Bills (2-3) 37-24 four days ago, concludes
tonight with the  New York  Jets (2-2) visiting the Atlanta
Falcons (1-3). The  Minnesota Vikings , Pittsburgh Steelers, Tampa
Bay Buccaneers and  Washington Redskins  had byes.  Denver Comeback  In Dallas, the Cowboys scored on their first two
possessions to open a 14-0 lead before the Broncos scored
touchdowns on five consecutive possessions to take a 35-20 lead
during the third quarter. Among them was a 1-yard bootleg run by
Manning, his first rushing score since 2008.  Romo threw four second-half touchdown passes to put Dallas
ahead 48-41 before Manning, who threw his first interception of
the season in the third quarter, directed a 73-yard drive
completed by a one-yard touchdown run by Knowshon Moreno with
2:44 left.  Romo, the 12th quarterback in NFL history to top 500
passing yards in a game, was sacked on the first play of the
ensuing drive and then was intercepted by Broncos linebacker
Danny Trevathan. Denver got two first downs to set up Prater’s
winning kick, including a run of just over a yard by Moreno on a
3rd-and-1 from Dallas’s 2-yard line.  ‘Get Out’  “I’ve never been in a situation quite like that in the end
where we needed to get the first down but we didn’t need to
score,” Manning said. “Knowshon and I were arguing at the end.
He basically was asking, ‘How can I get half a yard but not get
a yard and a half?’ I just said, ‘You can’t score. You can’t do
it. We have to get the first down, kick a field goal and get out
of this place.’”  Brees recorded his first victory in four career games at
Chicago’s  Soldier Field , where he threw two second-quarter
touchdown passes to Pierre Thomas for the Saints.  Jimmy Graham 
had his fourth consecutive 100-yard receiving game -- tying the
NFL record for a tight end -- with 10 catches for 135 yards for
the Saints, who last won in Chicago on Oct. 8, 2000.  The Chiefs are 5-0 for the first time in 10 years after
scored 13 points in the final six minutes, 23 seconds in
Nashville. Jamal Charles scored on a one-yard run and Ryan
Succop kicked his third and fourth field goals of the game for
Kansas City, which had fallen behind 17-13 after opening a 13-0
halftime lead against the Titans (3-2).  Brady Held  Former Patriots running back  BenJarvus Green-Ellis  had the
lone touchdown in Cincinnati, scoring on a one-yard run for the
Bengals (3-2).  New England  was kept out of the end zone for the
first time since Sept. 20, 2009, while Brady fell two games shy
of Brees’s NFL record of 54 straight games with a scoring pass.  The Seahawks were denied the first 5-0 start in franchise
history after blowing leads of 12-0 and 25-17 in Indianapolis.
Luck threw a pair of touchdown passes to T.Y. Hilton, while
Donald Brown scored on a three-yard run midway through the
fourth quarter to give the Colts (4-1) the lead for good.  The Eagles lost Vick to a hamstring injury during the
second quarter and blew a 19-7 halftime lead before rallying for
their second win in their past three trips to MetLife Stadium in
East Rutherford, New Jersey.  After Alex Henery’s fifth field goal of the game gave the
Eagles a 22-21 lead with 1:04 left in the third quarter, Foles
threw fourth-quarter touchdown passes to Brent Celek and  DeSean Jackson  just over two minutes apart.  New York last started the season 0-5 in 1987, when NFL
teams used replacement, non-union players for part of the season
during a strike.  To contact the reporter on this story:
