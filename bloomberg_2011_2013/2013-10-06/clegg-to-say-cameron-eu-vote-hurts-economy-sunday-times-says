Deputy U.K. Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
will say this week that Prime Minister  David Cameron  is damaging
the country’s economy by promising to hold a referendum on
membership in the European Union, the Sunday Times reported.  In an Oct. 8 speech, Clegg will say Cameron’s pledge is
“playing with fire” and taking a “short-sighted political
calculation that could jeopardize the long-term national
interest,” the newspaper said, without saying where it obtained
the information.  Cameron said in January he wanted to renegotiate the U.K.’s
membership of the EU and hold a referendum on the results by
late 2017. While he hasn’t spelled out precise demands, U.K.
lawmakers said they want powers over justice, policing and
worker protections to be returned to national capitals. He said
he wants the 28-nation bloc to focus on its single-market
aspects to help growth.  Separately, a group of U.K. politicians including
Conservative Member of Parliament Adam Afriyie will call
tomorrow for the government to hold the referendum a year from
now, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
