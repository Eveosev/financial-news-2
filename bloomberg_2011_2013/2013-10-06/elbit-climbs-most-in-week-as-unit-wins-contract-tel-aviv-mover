Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT)  advanced the most
in a week in Israel after the defense systems developer said its
unit won a $33 million-contract to supply electro-optical
instruments for helicopters from an Asian customer.  Shares of the Haifa-based company gained 2 percent, the
most since Sept. 29, to 187.70 shekels, or the equivalent of
$52.89, at the close in Tel Aviv. The benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  rose
1.4 percent. Elbit shares traded in  New York  closed at $52.36 on
Oct. 4. Last month, the company said it won a U.S. contract
valued at $45 million.  “The order is another small addition to a nicely growing
backlog of orders,” Dov Rozenberg, an analyst at Clal Finance
Batucha Brokerage Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by phone. “It points
to management’s ability to secure orders in challenging times.”  Elbit’s Tel Aviv shares have climbed 26 percent this year,
compared with a 7.6 percent rise for the TA-25 index, as second-quarter profit rose 30 percent and order backlog grew for a
fifth consecutive quarter. The company is seeking to stay
competitive by boosting its focus on advanced defense
electronics and optics, Chief Executive Officer Bezhalel Machlis
said in an interview in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
