Former England fast-bowler Steve Harmison announced his retirement from professional cricket
after a career that included 63 Tests and two Ashes series wins.  Harmison, 34, took 226 Test wickets at an average of 31.82,
after first being included in the national set-up in 1998.  His retirement comes after a season when his Durham team
won the County Championship, although he didn’t make any first-class appearances in this year’s campaign.  “I did not want to take the shine off such a magnificent
season for Durham by announcing my retirement before it had
finished,” Harmison told  Durham’s website . “I may not have
been able to contribute in the way I wished, but I have at least
got what I most wanted out of the 2013 season -- the County
Championship trophy back in the cabinet at Chester-le-Street.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
