Bayern Munich,  Germany ’s richest soccer club, is set to record its most lucrative financial year ever with a revenue increase of more than 20 percent, Chief Executive Officer Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said in an interview.  “We can report more than 400 million euros ($545 million) as a total income,” Rummenigge said Oct. 1 in Manchester. Bayern had sales of 332 million euros in the last fiscal year.  Profit also increased in the period, he said. That would give the club its 21st straight year without a loss. The team had earnings of 11 million euros last fiscal year, which ended June 30, 2012.  “All divisions like merchandise, sponsorship, ticketing and so on are on a level like never before,” the 58-year-old former Bayern striker said. Rummenigge was in Manchester for his club’s 3-1 Champions League victory over Manchester City last week.  Bayern, which won last season’s elite European club competition as well as a 23rd domestic league title, is Germany’s most successful club on and off the pitch. It generates more commercial revenue than any club in the world thanks to sponsors which include Adidas AG, Volkswagen AG’s Audi and Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile.  Adidas and Audi each own a 9.1 percent stake in the club. The remaining 81.8 percent is owned by more than 200,000 members who each pay 50 euros a year for a say in how the club is run.  In terms of combined revenue Bayern is only surpassed by Real Madrid,  Barcelona  and Manchester United, clubs that get more in sales from international broadcast rights. Rummenigge said the Bundesliga must do “much, much better” in its efforts to boost overseas exposure.  Bayern Munich will announce results at its annual general meeting on Nov. 13.
