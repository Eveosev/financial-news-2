Carlos Hyde rushed for 168 yards and
three touchdowns as fourth-ranked  Ohio State University  rallied
twice in the fourth quarter to defeat No. 16  Northwestern
University  40-30, extending college football’s longest winning
streak to 18 games.  Fifth-ranked Stanford scored touchdowns in the first and
final 12 seconds of the first half yesterday and withheld a late
Washington surge in a 31-28 victory over the No. 15 Huskies.  In other games involving teams ranked in the Associated

lead, the first time that Ohio State trailed this season, and
stayed ahead for most of the first three quarters. The Wildcats
were unable to hold fourth-quarter leads of 23-20 and 30-27 as
Hyde scored twice in the final frame, including a seven-yard run
with 5:22 remaining to put the Buckeyes up for good.  “It was a street fight, a 12-rounder,” Ohio State coach
Urban Meyer said in a televised interview after the game. “Any
time you go 12 rounds with someone and you survive it, it makes
you tougher.”  Winning Streak  Despite committing three turnovers to Northwestern’s one,
the Buckeyes outgained the Wildcats 451 yards to 437 yards. Ohio
State has not lost since the final game of the 2011 season, an
18-game winning streak that is the longest in college football’s
top division.  In Stanford, the Cardinal took a 7-0 lead when Ty
Montgomery returned the opening kickoff 99 yards for a
touchdown. The Huskies cut the Stanford lead to three points
four different times throughout the game, but were unable to
take the lead on their final possession, which stalled on
Stanford’s 49 yard line with 1:16 remaining.  Montgomery also caught three passes for 56 yards and a
score, and rushed for 30 yards. Washington running back Bishop
Sankey ran for 125 yards and two touchdowns in the loss.  -- Editor: Garry Smith  To contact the reporter on this story:
