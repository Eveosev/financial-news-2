The winless Jacksonville Jaguars lost
left tackle Luke Joeckel, the second overall selection in this
year’s National Football League draft, for the rest of the
season with a broken ankle.  The 6-foot-6, 306-pound Joeckel, from Texas A&M University,
suffered the left leg injury during today’s 34-20 loss to the
St. Louis Rams that dropped the Jaguars to 0-5.  The Jaguars last week traded left tackle Eugene Monroe to
the Baltimore Ravens so they could move Joeckel to the position
after the rookie started the first four games of the season at
right tackle. Cameron Bradfield, a three-year veteran who
entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent out of Grand Valley
State, is listed as the Jaguars’ backup at left tackle.  The Jaguars visit the Denver Broncos in Week 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
