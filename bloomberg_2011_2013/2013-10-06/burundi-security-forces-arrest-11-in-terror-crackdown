Burundi police arrested 11 people in
an anti-terrorist crackdown made in the wake of an attack by
militants on a shopping mall in Nairobi last month in which at
least 67 civilians and security personnel were killed.  Five Pakistanis and a Nigerian were among those detained in
the raid across two districts of the Burundi capital Bujumbura,
according to police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye. The operation
was part of the country’s effort to investigate those who have
no identification papers and whose activities are unknown, he
said today.  As many as 15 gunmen of the Somali Islamist group, Al-Shabaab, stormed the upmarket Westgate mall in the Kenyan
capital on Sept. 21, spraying bullets and lobbing grenades at
the start of a four-day siege. Al-Shabaab had threatened attacks
in  Kenya  after the country sent troops to Somalia in October
2011 to oust the militia group. Burundi has also faced threats
since it joined the African peace mission to Somalia known as
 AMISON  in 2007.  “There are people who are suspicious and who need to
explain what they are doing in Burundi,” Nkurikiye said. Police
conducted regular searches in the landlocked East African
country and had arrested hundreds of people, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
