The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. pumps fell 13.78 cents in the past two weeks to
$3.3829 a gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc.  The survey covers the period ended Oct. 4 and is based on
information obtained at about 2,500 filling stations by the
Camarillo, California-based company.  The average, which reached a year-to-date peak in the
survey of $3.795 on Feb. 22, is about 45.46 cents below the
year-earlier price of $3.8375 a gallon.  “Oil price cuts during September have run their course and
are now on the street,” Trilby Lundberg, president of Lundberg
Survey, said in a telephone interview. “Refiners have no more
to give, in my opinion. They have very narrow margins on
gasoline.”  The highest price for gasoline in the lower 48 U.S. states
among the markets surveyed was the San Francisco bay area, at
$3.88 a gallon, Lundberg said.  The lowest price was in St. Louis, where customers paid an
average of $3.01 a gallon. Regular gasoline averaged $3.61 a
gallon on Long Island, New York, and $3.84 in Los Angeles.  Gasoline futures  on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell
7.66 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $2.6076 a gallon in the two weeks
ended Oct. 4.  Futures have declined for five consecutive weeks as
refineries  operated  at the highest seasonal rates in Energy
Information Administration data going back to 1989. U.S. plants
processed 15.9 million barrels a day of crude and other
feedstocks in the week ended Sept. 27.  Gasoline stockpiles  are 7.4 percent above the five-year
average for this time of year, according to data from the EIA,
the statistical arm of the Energy Department.  In the two weeks to Oct. 4, West Texas Intermediate crude
fell 83 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $103.84 a barrel on the Nymex.  Crude  inventories  surged 5.47 million barrels to 363.7
million last week, the biggest gain since the week ended April
26, EIA data show.  Cushing supplies slipped 59,000 barrels to 32.8 million
last week, according to the EIA. Stockpiles at the hub have
dropped 34 percent since June 28 as improved pipeline networks
and shipments by rail eased a North American supply glut created
by rising oil production from shale formations.  West Texas Intermediate crude probably will decline next
week on concern that a political impasse in  Washington  over the
budget could lead to a recession, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Eighteen of 30 analysts, or 60 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Oct. 11. Six respondents, or 20 percent,
predicted an increase and six said that there would be no
change.  To contact the reporters on this story:
