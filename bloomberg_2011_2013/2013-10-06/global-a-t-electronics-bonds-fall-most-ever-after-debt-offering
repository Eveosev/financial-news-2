The bonds of Global A&T Electronics
Ltd. fell the most since being issued in January after selling
an additional $502.3 million of secured notes, diluting the
collateral tied to the initial transaction.  The Singapore-based semiconductor tester’s $625 million of
first-lien debentures due 2019 dropped 19.5 cents on the dollar
to 69.5 cents for the week ended Oct. 4, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. Those securities traded at a high this year of 109
cents on April 11.  The offering resulted in “massive collateral dilution”
for the debt outstanding,  Adam Cohen , the founder of research
firm Covenant Review LLC, wrote in an Oct. 4 report.  Standard & Poor’s  gave the new notes a B rating, according
to an Oct. 4 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
