The Sydney Roosters beat the Manly
Warringah Sea Eagles 26-18 in  Australia ’s National Rugby League
grand final to secure their first championship in 11 years.  The Roosters rallied from 10 points down in the second half
at Sydney’s ANZ Stadium last night as Aidan Guerra, Shaun Kenny-Dowall and Michael Jennings all scored tries that were converted
by James Maloney, who booted 10 points.  The Roosters, who finished atop the regular-season
standings, secured their 13th elite Australian rugby league
title to give coach Trent Robinson, 36, a premiership in his
first season in charge.  Leading 8-6 at half time in front of a crowd of 81,491, the
Roosters allowed 12 straight points early in the second half,
including a penalty try, to trail 18-8 before their fight back.
Jorge Taufua and Steve Matai got the other tries for Manly,
which had been seeking its third championship in six years.  Losing half back Daly Cherry-Evans was awarded the Clive
Churchill Medal as the man of the match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
