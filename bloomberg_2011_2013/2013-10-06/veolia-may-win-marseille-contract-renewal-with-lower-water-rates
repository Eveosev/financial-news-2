Veolia Environnement SA (VIE) ,  France ’s
biggest water company by market value, moved closer to getting a
contract renewed in Marseille that includes a drop in water
prices of about 20 percent, the southern French city said.  The 15-year deal will probably also include 110 million
euros ($149 million) of investment in water and waste
installations, the  Marseille Provence Metropole , which
represents 18 communities including Marseille, said in a
statement posted on its website. The contract was approved by
Eugene Caselli, the head of the municipal grouping, and has to
be made official by a vote.  Veolia and rival  Suez Environnement (SEV)  are facing municipal
contract renewals across France that are sometimes resulting in
price reductions. Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot
said in January the utility could lose half its margins on the
many contracts being reviewed by 2015 if it doesn’t boost
productivity.  The terms of the new Marseille contract include a decrease
in water prices to 1.51 euros a cubic meter, compared with the
current 1.82 euros for households using an average annual volume
of 120 cubic meters a year, according to the statement. For
those using 80 cubic meters a year, the price will drop to 1.44
euros a cubic meter.  The Marseille contract is held through Veolia Eau’s Societe
des Eaux de Marseille, which has provided water distribution to
the city since 1943.  Frerot is seeking to make Veolia less reliant on municipal
water contracts in favor of services to industry. The company
has a goal of selling 6 billion euros of assets in 2012 and 2013
to lower debt, and intends to lower costs by 170 million euros
this year as part of a plan to save 750 million euros by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
