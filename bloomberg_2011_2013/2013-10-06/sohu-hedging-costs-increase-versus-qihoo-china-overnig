Options traders are paying more to
protect against swings in  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  relative to rival  Qihoo
360 Technology Co. (QIHU)  for the first time since July on concern a
merger will fail to boost its search engine market share.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
one-month contracts closest to Sohu’s shares exceeded that for
Qihoo last week for the first time since July 18, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. Sohu shares have rallied 34 percent since
 Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700)  invested in Sohu’s search unit on Sept.
16. The Bloomberg China-US Equity  Index (HSCEI)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. rallied 2.6 percent last week.  Sohu, a Beijing-based Internet company, sold a 36.5 percent
stake in its subsidiary Sogou to Tencent for $448 million in
order to boost traffic for the third-biggest search engine in
the country. Sogou accounted for 5.5 percent of online queries
in China in the first quarter, lagging behind  Baidu Inc (BIDU) ’s 82
percent market share and Qihoo 360 Technology Co.’s 9 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It’ll take time for Sohu’s Sogou to strengthen its
competitiveness versus bigger rivals like Qihoo even with the
investment from Tencent,” Tian X Hou, the founder of T. H.
Capital LLC, a research firm focusing on Chinese Internet
companies, said in a telephone interview from New York Oct. 4.
“The options indicated a bigger risk for Sohu’s share price to
decline than Qihoo.”  Implied volatility for one-month options closest to Sohu’s
shares has jumped 43 percent from a Aug. 26 low to 56.3 on Oct.
4, data compiled by Bloomberg show. During that time, implied
volatility for Qihoo has dropped 3.8 percent to 56.2.  Data Sharing  Tencent and Sogou will jointly develop and integrate their
services in areas including search and data sharing, the
companies said in the Sept. 16 statement. Tencent will merge its
own search unit with Sogou. Sohu Chief Executive Officer Charles
Zhang said talks with Qihoo had ended and the company won’t seek
additional investors for its search unit in the “near future.”
In July, Qihoo said it was in talks to buy Sogou.  Qihoo’s share in the Internet search market rose to about
20 percent on Sept. 14 while that for Sogou was 11 percent by
the end of August, 86Research Ltd. wrote in a note dated Sept.
17, citing Chinese data provider CNZZ.  Sohu surged 14 percent last week to $86.70 in New York, the
highest since July 2011. The shares gained 83 percent this year.
Qihoo’s American depositary receipts added 2.7 percent last week
to $86.17, taking its rally in 2013 to 190 percent.  Sina, Renren  Chinese Internet companies from  Sina Corp. (SINA)  to  Renren Inc. (RENN) 
drove rallies in the China-US gauge last week as Twitter Inc.’s
planned initial public offering boosted social-media companies.  Twitter, which has more than 200 million monthly users,
made public its S-1 prospectus on Oct. 3 saying it’s seeking to
raise $1 billion in an IPO. The documents suggested a valuation
of $12.8 billion.  Sina, based in  Shanghai , jumped 10 percent last week to
$90.48 in New York, the highest since October 2011. ADRs of
Beijing-based Renren surged 20 percent in the week to a seven-week high of $4.04.  YY Inc. (YY) , a social entertainment website, advanced to
$49.72, bringing its weekly gain to 3.1 percent. It climbed to
$50.47 on Oct. 2, the highest since its IPO in November.  Chinese ETF  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (SOCL) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., climbed 1 percent last week to
$38.01. The Global X Social Media Index  ETF (FXI) , which tracks 27
social media companies including Facebook Inc. and Tencent,
advanced 1.8 percent last week.  “Twitter’s IPO is a vote of confidence for the social-media industry,” Jay Jacobs, a research analyst at Global X
Funds, a New York-based exchange-traded fund that manages $2.3
billion in assets, said by phone Oct. 4. “There’s a big
appetite right now for a lot of these social media related
names, including China’s Sina, Tencent.”  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 0.2 percent
last week to 10,517.28. Markets in mainland  China  will remain
closed until Oct. 8 for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
