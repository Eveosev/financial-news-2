Euro-region banks’ profit growth may
be hampered by provisions for bad loans as the  European Central
Bank  leads a review of lenders’ asset quality, Ernst & Young LLP
said in a report.  Total bank operating income is expected to rise 7.1 percent
in 2014, after increasing 1 percent this year, led by lenders in
 Italy , Germany and  France , according to the report, published
today. That’s less than the 7.6 percent 2014 growth and the 2
percent 2013 increase estimated by Ernst & Young in July.  While banks will benefit from a decrease in non-performing
loans, which are expected to peak at 7.8 percent of total loans
this year, the ECB review will probably bring tougher
provisioning standards, Ernst & Young said. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said last week the asset-quality review must be
transparent and rigorous as the central bank prepares to take
over supervision of all euro-area lenders next year.  Ernst & Young forecasts total lending will grow 3.2 percent
in 2014, while deposits will increase 3.6 percent, helping to
boost bank profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
