Two Canadians who had been detained
in  Egypt  since their arrest in August during a government
crackdown, were released, according to the Canadian government.  John Greyson, a professor at  York University  in Toronto,
and Tarek Loubani, a physician from  London , Ontario, had been
held in Cairo since Aug. 16, the university said in a statement
today.  Greyson, the director of York’s graduation program in film,
was in Cairo to do documentary work and was with Loubani at the
time of their arrest, Joanne Rider, a spokeswoman for the school
said in a telephone interview. Rider said she didn’t know when
they will return to Canada.  “We’re waiting to get more details,” she said.  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Lynne Yelich said in
a statement yesterday that  Canada  welcomes the decision to
release the men and that the Canadian government is
“facilitating” the men’s departure from Egypt. A spokesman for
the office couldn’t be reached for comment.  “I look forward to Dr. Loubani and Mr. Greyson being
reunited with their families and friends, who have shown
tremendous strength during this difficult time,” Yelich said.  According to the Associated Press, the men say they were
observing an anti-government demonstration Aug. 16 when Loubani
heeded a call for a doctor and began treating wounded
demonstrators while Greyson recorded the unrest on video.  To contact the reporters on this story:
