A case of 2010 Chateau Leoville-Las
Cases, a  Bordeaux  second-growth wine estate, sold for 1,560
pounds ($2,500) on Liv-ex, taking the vintage to a record low on
the exchange amid muted demand for top wines from the region.  The transaction on Oct. 4 was 4 percent below the level of
1,620 pounds at which it traded at the end of August, and 20
percent down from the 1,956 pounds a case at which it traded in
July 2011, soon after market release, when Chinese demand for
top Bordeaux was peaking.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has fallen since mid-March
following a subdued response to the sales campaign for Bordeaux
2012 wine futures. While gains in the first three months of the
year mean the benchmark is still up 2 percent since the end of
December, wine investors have been looking for price growth
beyond the core Bordeaux markets as Chinese demand has dropped.  “ Asia  seems to have been pretty quiet,”  Chris Smith , an
investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in London, said
by phone Oct. 2, citing “fairly weak demand” from the region.
The fund, invested in Bordeaux, manages $50 million.  The 2010 Leoville-Las Cases ranks as the estate’s third-highest-priced wine of the past 10 years, lagging only those
from 2009 and 2005, according to merchant prices collated by
 Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  It was rated 96+ on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic  Robert Parker  in a February 2013 online tasting note, making it the
fourth-highest ranked vintage of the past 15 years.  Leoville-Las Cases is in the Saint-Julien district north of
the city of Bordeaux, and is part of a larger estate that was
divided in the nineteenth century. It was designated a second-growth vineyard in the classification drawn up for Napoleon
III’s 1855 Paris Exhibition, which remains in force.  To contact the reporter on this story:
