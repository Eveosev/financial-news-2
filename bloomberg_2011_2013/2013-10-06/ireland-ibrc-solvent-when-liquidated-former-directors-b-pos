Former directors of the Irish Bank
Resolution Corp. say the business was solvent when the
government placed it in liquidation earlier this year, the
Sunday Business Post reported, citing company documents.  IBRC had assets of nearly 26.5 billion euros ($35.9
billion). The documents were filed with the Irish Department of
Finance, according to the report.  The state-controlled IBRC was created when the former Anglo
Irish Bank Corp. merged with the Irish Nationwide Building
Society in 2011. The government forced the company into
liquidation in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
