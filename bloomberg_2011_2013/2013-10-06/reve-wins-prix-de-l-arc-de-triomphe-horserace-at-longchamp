Treve won the Prix de l’Arc de
Triomphe,  Europe ’s richest horserace, at Longchamp in Paris
today.  The three-year-old French filly, a 9-2 shot, was ridden by
Thierry Jarnet and trained by Criquette Head-Maarek.  Japan ’s
race favorite Orfevre came second, five lengths back, and
France’s Intello was third.  Italian jockey Frankie Dettori was due to ride Treve but
broke an ankle last week. Jarnet also won the race in 1992 and
1994, and Head-Maarek trained Three Troikas to victory in 1979.  The Arc is Europe’s top race for three-year-olds and older,
over a distance of 1 1/2 miles. It’s worth about $3 million to
the winner.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
