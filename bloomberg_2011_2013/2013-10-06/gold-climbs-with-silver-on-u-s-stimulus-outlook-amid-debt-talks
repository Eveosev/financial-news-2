Gold rose for the first time in three
sessions as U.S. lawmakers remained deadlocked over extending
the nation’s debt limit to avoid default amid a government
shutdown, stoking demand for the metal as a store of value.  With the U.S. set to exhaust measures to avoid breaching
its debt ceiling on Oct. 17, House of Representatives Speaker
 John Boehner  said lawmakers won’t raise the limit without
packaging it with other provisions. President  Barack Obama ’s
administration has said it won’t negotiate with Republicans over
funding the government or raising the debt ceiling.  “Gold is getting some bids because of the uncertainty,”
 Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services
LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “It will be a
very big deal if the U.S. defaults.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 1.2 percent to
settle at $1,325.10 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Prices dropped 2.2 percent last week amid speculation that
the Federal shutdown that has furloughed 800,000 workers would
be short-lived.  Volume was 43 percent below the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  The U.S. faced an impasse over raising the debt ceiling in
2011 before Congress approved a plan to head off a default. Gold
reached a record $1,923.70 on Sept. 6, 2011.  Prices are set for a first annual drop in 13 years as some
investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value and on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will slow its debt
purchases.  Silver futures for December delivery jumped 2.9 percent to
$22.386 an ounce, after reaching $22.495, the highest for a
most-active contract since Sept. 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery advanced 1 percent to $1,401.90 an ounce.
Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$705.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
