The Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St.
Louis Cardinals 5-3 to lead their Major League Baseball playoff
series by two games to one.  The Pirates can close out the best-of-five National League
Division Series with a victory in Game 4 in Pittsburgh tomorrow.
A win for the Cardinals would force a decider in St. Louis on
Oct. 9.  The series winner will play the Los Angeles Dodgers or the
Atlanta Braves for a place in the World Series. That series
continues tonight in Los Angeles with the teams tied at one win
apiece.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
