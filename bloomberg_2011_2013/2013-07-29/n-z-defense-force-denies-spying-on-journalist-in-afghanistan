New Zealand ’s  Defence Force  denied
spying on a journalist while he was working for U.S. news
organization McClatchy Co. in  Afghanistan .  In an article in the Sunday Star-Times newspaper yesterday,
reporter Nicky Hager alleged that the Defence Force helped U.S.
spy agencies to monitor the phone calls of New Zealand
journalist Jon Stephenson and his associates in Afghanistan last
year. The Defence Force was unhappy at Stephenson’s reporting of
its handling of Afghan prisoners and was trying to find out who
was giving him confidential information, the article said.  “I have asked the officers responsible for our operations
in Afghanistan whether they have conducted monitoring of Mr.
Stephenson as alleged by Mr. Hager and they have assured me that
they have not,” acting Defence Chief Major General Tim Keating
said in a statement today. “This includes asking foreign
organizations to do this on our behalf. We have identified no
information at this time that supports Mr. Hager’s claims.”  New Zealand has 27 military personnel in Afghanistan
supporting operations, according to the defense force website.
The nation is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance that also includes the U.S., U.K., Australia
and  Canada , the  Associated Press  reported today.  Defense Minister Jonathan Coleman also issued a statement
saying he has seen “no evidence to support these claims at this
point.”  “However, the Defence Force is carrying out extensive
record checks to see if there is any evidence that this
occurred,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
