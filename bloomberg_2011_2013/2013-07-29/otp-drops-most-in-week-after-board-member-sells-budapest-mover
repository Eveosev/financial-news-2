OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, tumbled the most in more than a week and volatility
surged after a board member sold shares, following a similar
move by the chief executive officer less than two weeks ago.  The shares slumped 4.1 percent to 4,350 forint at the close
in Budapest, after an 8.1 percent gain last week. OTP was the
biggest decliner on the benchmark  BUX Index (BUX) , which slid 1.7
percent, the third-worst performance globally among 94 indexes
tracked by Bloomberg. The bank’s 10-day volatility, which
measures price swings, climbed to the highest since 2011.  “This brings fears and the confidence issue to the
forefront again,”  Akos Kuti , head of research at Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt. in Budapest, said in a video message to
investors today.  Board of directors member Peter Braun sold 200,000 shares
on July 26, OTP said in a statement to the Budapest bourse.
Today’s share price slump was the most since July 19, the day
OTP announced the sale of 1.7 million OTP shares by CEO Sandor Csanyi and Bonitas 2002 Zrt., a company he controls. On July 22,
the bank said Bonitas had sold 650,000 more shares.  OTP plunged 17 percent in the four days through July 19 as
the government announced plans to help foreign-exchange mortgage
borrowers, a move that influenced the share sale, Csanyi said
July 24. The stock recouped some of the losses last week as an
Economy Ministry official said the nation will consult banks on
the plan and after Csanyi, 60, rejected reports that he was
considering leaving the company.  “Volatility of last week is still there in the stock,”
Szabolcs Vaszko, a Budapest-based equities trader at Erste Group
Bank AG, said by phone.  Ten-day volatility  surged to 69 today from 33 a month ago,
the highest level since December 2011, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. About 1.4 million  OTP shares  were traded,
92 percent of the stock’s three-month daily average, the data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
