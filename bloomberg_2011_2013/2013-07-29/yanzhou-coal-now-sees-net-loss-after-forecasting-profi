Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (1171) , China’s
fourth-largest producer of the fuel, reported a preliminary
first-half net loss of about 2.35 billion  yuan  ($383 million)
because of exchange-rate losses and declining coal prices.  The company apologized that the results were worse than it
forecast in April and said future projections will be more
scientific and accurate, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday. Yanzhou forecast on April 25 that first-half
net income would drop 75 percent from last year’s 4.91 billion
yuan.  Power-station coal in China fell to a four-year low, a
range of 560 yuan to 575 yuan a metric ton, on July 28 as
industrial demand declined amid evidence the economy is slowing,
the  China  Coal Transport and Distribution Association said
yesterday. Prices have dropped in the past six weeks.  One reason Yanzhou missed its forecast was a change in
exchange rates, which cut net income by 1.79 billion yuan more
than previously estimated, according to the statement. The
company also said impairments on the value of some of its mines
were 1.12 billion yuan more than expected and falling prices for
its coal products reduced first-half net income by an additional
890 million yuan more than projected.  Last week, the Shandong province-based company said
Chairman Li Weimin and Vice Chairman Wang Xin resigned due to
“work allocation” without giving further explanation. Today’s
preliminary profit statement didn’t mention the resignations.  China’s  coal demand  rose 1.8 percent in the first six
months of 2013 to 1.93 billion tons, the China National Coal
Association said in a statement on July 18. The gain was 1
percentage point down from the same period last year and 7.6
points lower than in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
