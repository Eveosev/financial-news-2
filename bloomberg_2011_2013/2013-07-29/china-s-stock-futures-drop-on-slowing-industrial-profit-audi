China’s stocks  fell the most in
three weeks after industrial companies reported slower profit
growth and the government ordered a review of state borrowings
amid concern potential bad debts may weigh down the economy.  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  and Huaxia Bank Co. slumped at least 2
percent, sending a gauge of financial companies to the biggest
loss among industry groups.  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (600585)  plunged 6.3
percent, dragging down material producers. PetroChina Co., the
nation’s biggest energy company, declined the most in two weeks.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 1.7 percent to 1,976.31
at the close. The State Council audit order was “urgent” and
the office suspended other projects to work on the review, the
People’s Daily said. Concern that loan losses will increase
extended the two-month drop in financial shares that was sparked
by a cash crunch in the interbank market and economist forecasts
for the weakest annual economic growth since 1990.  “The audit may bring concerns to investors that local
governments may have amassed a huge amount of debt, which will
provide a big drag on the economy and government-led
infrastructure construction,” said Li Jun, a strategist at
Central  China  Securities Co. in  Shanghai . “Industrial
companies’ profit numbers are pretty bad. Currently, there are
no positive catalysts for the market.”  Industrial Profits  Industrial companies’ net income increased 6.3 percent from
a year earlier to 502.4 billion yuan ($82 billion), the National
Bureau of Statistics said July 27, down from a 15.5 percent pace
in May. Profit from main business operations fell 2.3 percent
after an 8.8 percent gain the previous month, it said. The
Shanghai Composite has dropped 13 percent this year on concern
slowing growth will hurt earnings.  The CSI 300 Index declined 2.2 percent to 2,175.97 today,
while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  retreated 1.2
percent. The Shanghai index trades at 8 times 12-month projected
profit, the lowest level in at least five years,  data  compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure’s trading volumes were 18 percent
lower than the 30-day average, while 30-day  volatility  was at
26.7, near the highest level since December 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The State Council requested the National Audit Office to
conduct a review of government borrowings, according to a
 statement  yesterday. The first full audit since an initial
review two years ago underscores concern expressed by
institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, which this
month cited risks to the economy from borrowing by local
governments and an expansion of non-traditional sources of
credit.  Government Audit  “Local-government debt has become a focus in recent years
and is a source of concern about China’s growth,” said Ding Shuang, senior China economist at Citigroup Inc. in Hong Kong,
who previously worked for the IMF.  PetroChina slid for a fourth day, losing 1 percent to 7.88
 yuan . The stock was the biggest drag on the Shanghai Composite
today. Anhui Conch, China’s biggest cement producer, tumbled 6.3
percent to 14.09 yuan, the biggest loss since June 13.  A group of financial stocks slumped 2.7 percent, the
steepest decline among the CSI 300’s 10 industry groups.
Industrial Bank, part-owned by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, lost
2.3 percent to 9.13 yuan. Huaxia Bank, partly owned by Deutsche
Bank AG, fell 4 percent to 6.19 yuan.  China Merchants Bank Co. (600036) 
slid 2.3 percent to 10.49 yuan.  The government debt audit will bring new uncertainty to the
market and hurt banks’ share prices, Guotai Junan Securities Co.
wrote in a report.  EU Agreement  Shandong Iron and Steel Co.  fell 1.9 percent to 1.56 yuan
after saying it was ordered by the government to shut production
lines with capacity of 550,000 tons of coke. China last week
announced measures to support the economy such as ordering
companies in 19 industries to curb overcapacity amid signs
growth will ease for a third quarter.  EGing Photovoltaic Technology Co. climbed 1.8 percent to
10.25 yuan. Shanghai Chaori added 5 percent to 2.93 yuan.
 Zhejiang Sunflower Light Energy Science & Technology Co. (300111)  rose
3.3 percent to 12.19 yuan.  European Union and Chinese negotiators reached an agreement
to curb EU imports of solar panels from China in exchange for
exempting the shipments from punitive tariffs. The accord would
set a minimum price for imports of the renewable-energy
technology from China. In return, Chinese manufacturers would be
spared EU levies meant to counter below-cost sales, a practice
known as  dumping .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
