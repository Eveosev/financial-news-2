Secretary of State  John Kerry  named
veteran Middle East diplomat  Martin Indyk  to be his envoy for
talks between Israelis and Palestinians, a U.S. official said
today.  Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel and an Assistant
Secretary of State for Near East Affairs under President Bill
Clinton, has been director for foreign policy at the Brookings
Institution, a Washington policy group.  Kerry will announce the choice today at the State
Department, according to the official, who asked not to be
identified in advance of the secretary’s statement.  Kerry has pushed Israelis and Palestinians to resume
negotiations that have sputtered for two decades, with
negotiators from both sides set to begin talks with Kerry in
Washington today. Kerry hammered out the terms of negotiations
in months of intense shuttle diplomacy and has kept the terms
under tight wraps. Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  has said
the talks will last for nine months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
