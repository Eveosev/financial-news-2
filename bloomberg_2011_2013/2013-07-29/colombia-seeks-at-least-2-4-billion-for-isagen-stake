Colombia ’s government will auction
its majority stake in electricity company  Isagen SA (ISAGEN)  to raise
money for infrastructure projects, Finance Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said.  Colombia in the auction to be held in one month will offer
shares at 2,850 pesos each, which would value the government’s
stake at 4.5 trillion pesos ($2.4 billion), Cardenas told
reporters in Bogota today. The government wants to raise 5
trillion pesos or more for its 57.66% stake in the Medellin-based company, he said.  After the first auction, which will last 60 days and will
be open to a restricted group of bidders including company
employees, the government will hold a second round of bidding
where it expects to achieve a higher price, Cardenas said. He
didn’t say when the second stage will be held.  “Naturally, we hope that in the second round when we turn
to the market, there’ll be competition that increases the final
price above this base of 4.5 trillion pesos,” Cardenas said.  The government won’t spend any of the proceeds from the
sale before August 2014, Cardenas said. Isagen shares fell 0.9
percent to 2,720 pesos in Bogota trading today.  The government isn’t considering a sale of any part of its
stake in oil company  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Cardenas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
