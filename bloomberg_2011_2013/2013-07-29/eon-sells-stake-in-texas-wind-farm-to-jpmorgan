EON SE (EOAN) , Germany’s largest utility,
sold a stake in its Anacacho wind farm in Texas to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. for $76.6 million and a commitment for future
funding.  The bank bought a “partial interest” and will make
further capital contributions, EON Climate & Renewables North
America, a subsidiary of the Dusseldorf-based company, said in a
statement today. Matt Tulis, an EON spokesman, declined to say
how large a stake was sold.  The tax-equity financing gives JPMorgan a share of the
project’s 2.2 cents a kilowatt-hour production tax credit, Tulis
said by phone.  The 99-megawatt project, located in Kinney County, Texas,
consists of 55  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  1.8-megawatt turbines and
started operating in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
