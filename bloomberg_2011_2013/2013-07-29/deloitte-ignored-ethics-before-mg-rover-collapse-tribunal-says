Deloitte LLP disregarded ethical
codes while advising on transactions involving the now-defunct
U.K. car company MG Rover Group Ltd., an accounting tribunal
said today.  Deloitte and one of its former partners didn’t consider
conflicts of interest and failed to safeguard against “self-interest” in advising both MG Rover and Phoenix Venture
Holdings Ltd., its parent company at the time, the Financial
Reporting Council Tribunal ruled, according to a  statement  on
its website.  “Deloitte’s advice, which itself was not criticized,
helped to generate over 650 million pounds ($998 million) of
value for the MG Rover Group, keeping the company alive for five
years longer than might have been the case and securing 5,000
jobs in the West Midlands during this period,” James Igoe, a
spokesman for Deloitte, said in a statement on the tribunal’s
decision.  MG Rover went bankrupt in 2005 with 1.3 billion pounds of
debt and some 6,000 people lost their jobs. Nanjing Automobile
Group Corp., a state-owned Chinese company, bought the assets of
MG Rover in July of that year for about $97 million.  “The outcome of this tribunal sends a strong clear
reminder to all accountants and accountancy firms that they have
a responsibility to act in the public interest in the work they
undertake,”  Paul George , an FRC director, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
