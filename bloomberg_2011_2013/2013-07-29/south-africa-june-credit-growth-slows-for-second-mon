South African credit growth slowed
for a second month to 8.9 percent in June.  Growth in  borrowing  by households and companies fell from
9.1 percent in the previous month, the Pretoria-based  Reserve
Bank  said on its website today. The median estimate of 13
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg was 8.8 percent.  The Reserve Bank has kept the benchmark repurchase rate at
5 percent for a year as a decline in the rand and rising fuel
prices spur inflation, limiting the room to cut  interest rates 
to stimulate the economy.  Consumer spending  in the first quarter
grew at the slowest pace since the 2009 recession.  “Growth in credit extension is likely to remain relatively
subdued during the second half of the year, as consumer and
business confidence is still fragile, the job market remains
weak and high existing personal debt and tight lending standards
will make consumers cautious of applying for more credit,”
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  said in an e-mailed note after the data were
released.  The rand dropped 0.6 percent to 9.8309 per dollar at 9:59
a.m. in Johannesburg, extending its decline of 14 percent this
year.  The broad M3  measure  of  money supply  rose 9.2 percent in
June from a year earlier compared with 9.8 percent in May, the
central bank said. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was
9.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
