Lee Enterprises Inc. (LEE) , the owner of
local newspapers in the U.S. Midwest and West Coast, is seeking
to repay secured obligations to reduce its debt load.  The owner of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch may target a $621
million term loan that matures in December 2015, paying interest
at 6.25 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate, according to Carl Schmidt, chief financial officer of the
Davenport, Iowa-based company.  Lee, which completed a bankruptcy reorganization in January
2012, is planning to reduce the ratio of its total debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to less than 2 times, Schmidt said in a July 25 telephone
interview. The company’s leverage was 5.4  times  as of March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’re continuing to monitor the credit markets and talk
with bankers to see what our options are,” Schmidt said. The
company will seek to refinance the  term loan  by 2015 at the
latest, he said.  The first-lien obligation, which was arranged by Deutsche
Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was quoted at 99.1 cents
on the dollar today, Bloomberg prices show.  Lee had $876.1 million of total debt as of March 31, down
from $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2008, Bloomberg data
show.  Net income  dropped $16.7 million in 2012, narrower than
the $146.9 million loss in the prior year.  “We’ve been very focused on paying down debt and have been
aggressively doing that,” Schmidt said. “We would expect to
continue to do that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
