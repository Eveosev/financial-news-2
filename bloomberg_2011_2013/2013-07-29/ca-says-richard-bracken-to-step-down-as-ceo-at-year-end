Richard Bracken, chairman and chief
executive officer of  HCA Holdings Inc. (HCA) , the largest U.S. for-profit hospital chain, will step down as top executive at the
end of the year, the company said.  The board of directors named R. Milton Johnson, HCA’s
president and chief financial officer, as Bracken’s successor as
CEO, the Nashville, Tennessee-based company said today in a
statement.  “Richard has led HCA to a level of operational and
clinical achievement that I never dreamed possible when my
father and Jack Massey and I started HCA 45 years ago,” Thomas Frist Jr., founder of HCA, said in the statement.  Bracken, 60, joined HCA in 1981. He became chief executive
officer in 2009 and was appointed board chairman in December of
that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
