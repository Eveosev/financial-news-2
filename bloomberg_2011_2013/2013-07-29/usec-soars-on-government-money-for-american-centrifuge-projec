(Corrects name of community in final paragraph.)  USEC Inc. (USU) , a supplier of processed
uranium, surged after it won additional U.S. government funding
for its  American Centrifuge  enrichment project.  USEC  rose  51 percent to $29.02 at the close in New York,
the most in a week. Shares of the Bethesda, Maryland-based
energy company have more than doubled in the past week.  Additional funding of $29.9 million raises the U.S. Energy
Department’s financial commitment to the centrifuge project to
$227.7 million, USEC said today in a regulatory filing.  The American Centrifuge project is focused on developing a
new commercial technology for the enriching of uranium,
according to the company’s website. The research project is
 located  near Piketon,  Ohio .  To contact the reporter on this story:
