Relief pitcher Jose Veras was traded
to Detroit from the  Houston Astros  in exchange for outfield
prospect Danny Vasquez, an attempt by the Tigers to solidify
their bullpen and division lead.  Houston also received a player to be named on or before
Sept. 15 for the 32-year-old Veras, the Tigers said in a news
release posted on their website.  Veras hasn’t given up an earned run during seven outings
and eight innings pitched in July. He has a 2.93 earned run
average, 19 saves and an 0-4 record this season, with 44
strikeouts and 14 walks in 42 innings for Houston.  “Jose can pitch in a variety of roles, provides depth in
the bullpen, and complements the roles of Joaquin Benoit and
Drew Smyly,” Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers’ president, said in a
statement.  Veras has a 3.88 ERA in eight Major League Baseball
seasons, having also pitched for the  New York  Yankees,  Cleveland
Indians ,  Florida Marlins , Pittsburgh Pirates and Milwaukee
Brewers.  Detroit’s 4.01 bullpen ERA ranks 23rd among baseball’s 30
teams.  The Tigers are 59-45, three games ahead of Cleveland for
the American League Central lead. The Astros’ 35-69 record is
the worst in baseball.  Vasquez was batting .281 with five home runs, 39 runs
batted in, 16 doubles and five triples for Single-A West
Michigan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
