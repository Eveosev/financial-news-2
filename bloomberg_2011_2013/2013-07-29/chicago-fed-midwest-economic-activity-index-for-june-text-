Following is the text of
the Chicago Fed’s Midwest Economic Activity Index from
the Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago.  The Midwest Economy Index (MEI) edged up to -0.13 in June
from -0.16 in May, and the relative MEI increased to -0.07

indicates that Midwest economic growth was slightly lower than
would typically be suggested by the growth rate of the national
economy. Estimates of annual growth in gross state product (GSP)
for the five Seventh District states are no longer being released
with the MEI, but will continue to be available at
