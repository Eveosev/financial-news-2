Brazil ’s swap rates climbed after
economists raised their 12-month inflation forecast for a fourth
straight week, adding to speculation that the central bank will
step up increases in borrowing costs.  Swap rates due in January 2015 rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 9.45 percent at 10:04 a.m. in Sao
Paulo. The real was little changed at 2.2565 per dollar and is
down 11 percent in the past three months, the worst performance
among emerging-market dollar counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.
The currency has weakened 1.1 percent in July.  “You need to tighten more on the monetary side unless
there’s room to let inflation accelerate, and I don’t
think there is,”  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a telephone
interview from Toronto.  Economists raised their 12-month forecast for the annual
inflation rate to 5.83 percent from 5.78 percent a week earlier,
according to the median of about 100 estimates in a central bank
survey published today.  Brazil’s policy makers raised the  target lending rate  by a
half-percentage point on July 10 to 8.50 percent, the third
increase this year. The central bank said in minutes of the
meeting that it is appropriate to maintain the pace of increases
to curb inflation. Policy makers are next scheduled to decide on
borrowing costs Aug. 27-28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
