The driver of the train that crashed
last week near Santiago de Compostela, northern Spain, was
released on bail by a local judge yesterday.  The driver, identified by the initials F.J.G.A.,
potentially faces 79 charges of homicide through professional
negligence, the high court of Galicia said in an e-mailed
statement last night. He has been forbidden from leaving Spain
and his license to drive trains has been withdrawn for six
months.  A North American woman died yesterday as a result of the
accident, the court added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
