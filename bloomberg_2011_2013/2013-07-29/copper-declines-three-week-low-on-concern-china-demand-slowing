Copper fell to the lowest level in
almost three weeks on concern that demand from  China , the
biggest user, will continue to slow.  Metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange lost as much 0.6 percent to $6,820 a metric ton, the
lowest since July 10, and was at $6,838.75 at 10:14 a.m. in
 Shanghai . Metal for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 2.1 percent to 48,970  yuan  ($7,988) a ton.  Growth in Chinese industrial companies’ profits slowed in
June as the economy cooled, data from the government showed on
July 27. China’s statistics bureau is going to release the
official July Purchasing Manager’s Index on Aug. 1, which may
have dropped to 49.8, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “A lot of investors are bearish on China’s growth and
therefore bearish on copper demand,” said  Li Ye , an analyst at
Shenyin & Wanguo Futures Co. in Shanghai. “The official PMI
later this week probably won’t be good.”  Metal for delivery in September on the Comex lost 0.6
percent to $3.0885 a pound. Net-short positions, or wagers on
falling Comex prices, held by funds fell to 12,974 futures and
options as of July 23 from 15,673 a week earlier, according to
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  On the LME, tin also dropped, while aluminum, zinc and lead
gained. Nickel was little changed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
