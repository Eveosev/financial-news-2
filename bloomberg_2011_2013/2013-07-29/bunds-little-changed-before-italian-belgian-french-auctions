Italy’s  10-year bonds  declined for a
fifth day, the longest streak in 10 months, before the nation
sells 6.75 billion euros ($8.95 billion) of securities due in
2018 and 2024 tomorrow.  German 10-year bunds were little changed before European
Central Bank policy makers meet in  Frankfurt  on Aug. 1.  Belgium 
sold bonds due between 2018 and 2041, Italy auctioned 8.5
billion euros of six-month securities and investors bought 7.68
billion euros of French bills. Italian debt also declined amid
concern that a tax-fraud hearing faced by  Silvio Berlusconi ,
coalition partner of Prime Minister Enrico Letta, will cause
political instability.  “Maybe investors are looking at the auction tomorrow and
saying I don’t want to take a risk at the moment and don’t want
to be too involved in BTPs,” said Christian Lenk, a fixed-income analyst at DZ Bank AG in Frankfurt, referring to Italian
bonds. “I could well imagine that we see some pre-auction
concessions in the market.”  Italy’s 10-year  yield  rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 4.46 percent at 4:34 p.m. London time. The
4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 fell 0.43, or 4.30 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.705. The five-day increase in
yield is the longest since the period ended Sept. 26.  If  Italy ’s top court upholds a tax-fraud conviction against
Berlusconi tomorrow, People of Liberty party ministers may
resign from the government, Transport Minister Maurizio Lupi
said in an interview with Repubblica published today.  German Bunds  The German 10-year bund  yield  was at 1.66 percent after
rising two basis points to 1.69 percent. It climbed 15 basis
points last week.  The rate on similar-maturity Belgian debt slipped two basis
points to 2.55 percent. The additional yield, or spread,
investors demand to hold the bonds over bunds narrowed two basis
points to 89 basis points.  Improvement in the euro-area economy will be the “main
driver” and likely cause of the Belgian spread narrowing
further,  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  strategists led by Michael Rottmann, head
of fixed-income research in Munich, wrote in a note to clients.  Belgium sold 10-year bonds at an  average yield  of 2.549
percent down from 2.762 percent at an auction on June 24. That
compares with a record low of 1.971 percent in April.  Spanish 10-year yields increased six basis points to 4.68
percent.  Open Mind  Bunds have yielded between 1.50 percent and 1.74 percent
since July 4 when ECB President  Mario Draghi  said officials
would keep  interest rates  low or lower for “an extended
period.” While the yield has climbed 53 basis points from a
record low in June 2012, it’s still more than 150 basis points
less than its 3.24 percent average for the past decade.  Draghi also said after the central bank’s last policy
meeting that officials had an open mind on whether to cut the
deposit rate that the ECB pays lenders who park excess funds
with it overnight below zero.  The Frankfurt-based ECB will keep its refinancing rate at
0.5 percent and the deposit rate at zero after its Aug. 1
meeting, according to Bloomberg surveys of economists. The
 Federal Reserve  also meets this week to discuss whether to taper
its program of $85 billion monthly debt purchases. U.S. policy
makers have kept their target for overnight lending in a range
of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  “Overall the rhetoric of the central banks will remain
relatively dovish and that should be the main supporting
factor,” said Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist
at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “We will see a sideways
market over the next couple of weeks.”  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Germany and Belgium,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds returned 3 percent this year through July 26,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German and Belgian
bonds lost investors 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
