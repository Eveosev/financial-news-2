Abu Dhabi Distribution Co., the
emirate’s largest power and water company, has hired Black &
Veatch Corp. to assist it in achieving best industry practices.  State-owned ADDC seeks  PAS 55  certification, developed by
the U.K. Institute of Asset Management “to create a benchmark
for best practices in asset and infrastructure management,”
according to a  statement  today on the website of  Overland Park ,
Kansas-based Black & Veatch. Terms of the deal weren’t
disclosed.  Black & Veatch will audit ADDC’s business methods and
develop a plan to reach PAS 55 standards, Malcolm Hallsworth, a
spokesman for the closely held company, said in an interview
today. Reaching that certification will demonstrate to the Abu
Dhabi government that ADDC is maximizing efficiencies and
developing a skilled local workforce as fewer expatriates are
hired in the region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
