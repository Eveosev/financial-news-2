New York ’s Winged Foot Golf Club,
which has hosted five U.S. Opens, will be the site of the new
men’s Amateur Four-Ball championship for the U.S. Golf
Association in 2016.  The event was created last year when golf’s governing body
in the U.S. and  Mexico  said it was ending the men’s and women’s
U.S. Amateur Public Links championships after 2014.  San Francisco ’s  Olympic Club  will host the first men’s
four-ball event April 30-May 6, 2015, while  Oregon ’s  Bandon
Dunes  course will be the sight of the women’s championship over
the same dates.  The four-ball championships will feature two-player teams
competing against each other with the lower team score winning
each match.  Winged Foot in Mamaroneck, New York, will serve as host for
the men’s championship May 19-25, In 2016, with Streamsong
Resort, near Tampa,  Florida , hosting the women at the same time.
Winged Foot has hosted 11 other USGA championships and is set to
also stage the 2020  U.S. Open .  Streamsong  has never hosted a USGA event. The resort opened
in 2012 and features two courses, one designed by Bill Coore and
Ben Crenshaw and the other by Tom Doak, who also designed Bandon
Dunes Resort’s Pacific Dunes course, site of the 2006 amateur
Curtis Cup matches between the U.S. and Britain.  The four-ball championships will be limited to amateurs,
with no age restrictions. There will be 128 men’s teams and 64
women’s teams, each member playing their own ball through a
round. A team’s score will be determined using the lower score
of the partners for each hole. After 36 holes of stroke-play
qualifying, fields will be reduced to the low 32 teams for the
match-play bracket, which will determine the champions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
