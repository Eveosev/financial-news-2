Former Goldman Sachs Asset
Management Chairman Jim O’Neill is to become a non-executive
director at the U.K. Department for Education.  “Jim O’Neill has been invited to join the DfE board in a
non-executive capacity, and we expect him to take up his post in
September,” the ministry in  London  said in an e-mailed
statement today.  O’Neill, 56, stepped down from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
April. He’d been chairman of the New York-based firm’s asset-management division since 2010. He joined the company in 1995 as
a partner, became head of global economics, commodities and
strategy research in 2001 and was added to the European
management committee in 2006.  O’Neill developed the BRIC investment strategy, linking the
biggest emerging economies in  Brazil ,  Russia , India and China,
to reflect the waning influence of the U.S. on global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
