Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , Europe’s
second-biggest clothing retailer, reached its highest price in
ten months in Stockholm trading after Deutsche Bank AG upgraded
its stock rating and said earnings growth will accelerate.  The  shares gained  as much as 4.10 kronor, or 1.7 percent,
to 242.50 kronor, the highest level since Sept. 26 last year.
They rose 1 percent to 240.80 kronor as of 10:30 a.m. local
time, bringing this year’s advance to 7.3 percent.  Deutsche Bank raised its rating on H&M to buy from hold and
lifted its share-price estimate to 275 kronor from 240 kronor.
While currency translation effects, disappointing same-store
sales growth and decreases in H&M’s gross margin have prompted
analysts to cut their earnings forecasts in the past three
years, “we think these trends will stabilize and in some
instances reverse over the next 18 months,” Deutsche said.  “The combination of improving macro, online rollout,
better weather and FX should all now help the top line,”
Charlie Muir-Sands and Warwick Okines, analysts at Deutsche Bank
in  London , said in a note to clients. “Near term, the gross
margin outlook is also more favourable.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
