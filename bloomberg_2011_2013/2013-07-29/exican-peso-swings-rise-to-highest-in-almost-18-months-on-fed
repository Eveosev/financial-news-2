Mexican peso volatility climbed to
its highest level in almost 18 months on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will reduce a program of stimulus that has boosted
demand for the Latin American country’s assets.  The currency depreciated 0.6 percent to 12.7395 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:31 a.m. in Mexico City. Three-month historical
volatility, a measure of the peso’s fluctuations during the
period, rose to 13.4 percent, the highest since February 2012,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Swings in the peso have widened on speculation that U.S.
policy makers will slow the pace of $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases starting this year. Fed policy makers are scheduled to
meet for two days starting tomorrow.  “The whole tapering expectation, that’s been driving”
volatility in the peso,  Eduardo Suarez , a Latin America
strategist at Bank of Nova Scotia, said in a telephone interview
from Toronto. “They’re talking about reducing the pace at which
they’re providing stimulus. That expectation is what has been
weighing on  emerging markets  in general.”  The Fed will trim in September its monthly bond buying to
$65 billion, according to half of the economists surveyed by
Bloomberg in a July 18-22 survey.  The yield on government peso bonds maturing in 2024
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.93
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Foreign holdings of fixed-rate peso bonds surged to a
record earlier this year as investors tried to escape near-zero
rates at home by buying  Mexico ’s higher-yielding securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
