Italian borrowing costs dropped at
an auction of six-month bills from the previous month, when
European peripheral countries were under pressure amid concern
about a withdrawal of liquidity from central banks.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.3
billion) of 184-day bills at 0.799 percent, the lowest since May
and down from 1.052 percent at the previous auction June 26.
Investors bid for 1.47 times the amount offered, up from 1.36
last month.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose 2 basis points to 4.42
percent after the sale at 2 p.m. in  Rome , leaving the difference
with comparable German bunds at 276 basis points.  The Treasury announced last week it was canceling its mid-August bond auction, citing a surplus of cash. Italy returns to
the market tomorrow with the sale of as much as 6.75 billion
euros of longer-maturing bonds, including a new 10-year
security.  The Treasury will redeem about 25 billion euros of bonds
Aug. 1 and this “should create very supportive conditions for
the auction, as well as for the secondary market,”  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit Global
Research in Milan, wrote in a note to clients last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
