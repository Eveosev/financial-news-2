Cattle-herd expansion ended in
 Australia  after dry weather curbed restocking demand, prompting
farmers to boost slaughter in the world’s third-biggest beef and
veal exporter, according to an industry group.  The herd may total 28 million head on June 30, 2014 from
28.25 million on the same date this year,  Meat & Livestock
Australia  said in a report today. That compares with a January
forecast for 29.8 million in June 2013 and 30 million in 2014.  Total beef and veal exports may drop to 990,000 metric tons
shipped weight in 2014 from a record 1 million tons this year,
the group estimates. Prices tumbled to an almost 3-1/2 year low
in May after dry weather in parts of northern Australia damaged
pastures and increased slaughter. More than 40 percent of
Queensland, the top beef producer, was in  drought  as of June 28,
according to the state government. The national herd  peaked  at
about 29 million head in June 2012, the group said.  “As a consequence of the high turnoff this year, and on
top of large throughput in the final quarter of 2012, the
expansion of the Australian cattle herd has finished,” it said.
“Combined with the anticipated poorer branding and calving
rates for the coming year, the Australian herd is expected to
decline further.”  The Eastern Young Cattle Indicator, which measures prices
at auctions in the nation’s east, stood at A$3.303 ($3.06) a
kilogram today. Prices slumped to A$2.787 May 14, the lowest
since Dec. 14, 2009.  Editors: Ovais Subhani, Jake Lloyd-Smith  To contact the reporter on this story:
