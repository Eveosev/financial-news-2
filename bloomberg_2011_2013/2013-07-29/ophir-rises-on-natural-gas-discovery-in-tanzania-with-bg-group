Ophir Energy Plc (OPHR) , a U.K. explorer in
East and West Africa, rose in London trading after announcing a
natural gas discovery in waters off Tanzania.  Ophir added 2.4 percent to 387.70 pence as of 8:11 a.m. in
London.  Ophir and  BG Group Plc (BG/) ’s Mkizi-1 well encountered gas in
three reservoir intervals with net pay of 33 meters (108 feet),
Ophir said in a statement today in London. Estimates for the
recoverable resource were in line with pre-drill estimates of
0.6 trillion cubic feet.  BG last week raised its resource estimate for discoveries
in Tanzania with Ophir to 13 trillion cubic feet of gas. The
Deepsea Metro 1 drillship that made the lastest discovery, which
is located between two others in Block 1, will now move to drill
two appraisal wells.  “The successful Mkizi-1 well is our ninth discovery in
 Tanzania  and continues our 100 percent strike rate,” Ophir
Chief Executive Officer Nick Cooper said in the statement.  BG Group slipped 0.4 percent to 1,185 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
