Aberdeen Asset Management Plc (ADN) ,
 Scotland ’s largest money manager, posted 3.4 billion pounds
($5.2 billion) of quarterly outflows as investors pulled money
from its equity and emerging-market funds.  Clients removed about 2.5 billion pounds in June as market
volatility increased, the Aberdeen, Scotland-based firm said in
a statement today. That helped to cut assets under management to
209.6 billion pounds at the end of June from 212.3 billion
pounds at the end of March.  “We have delivered resilient figures during the third
quarter given the volatile global market conditions,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin Gilbert said in the statement. “Recent
volatility in markets undoubtedly had an impact on investor
sentiment and net flows to our emerging market debt funds
turned negative in the last few weeks of the quarter.”  The  stock fell  2.4 percent to 398.1 pence as of 8:03 a.m.
in London trading, for a market value of about 4.8 billion
pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
