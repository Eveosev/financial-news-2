Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  reduced its annual
profit forecast as countries that are key customers of the maker
of armored military vehicles cut budgets.  Earnings before interest and taxes before restructuring
measures at the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company were projected
to be 180 million euros to 200 million euros, short of a
previous forecast of 240 million euros to 260 million euros.  The company confirmed its outlook for its automotive unit.
Annual sales probably will be 4.7 billion euros to 4.8 billion
euros, Rheinmetall said in an e-mailed statement today.
Operating EBIT for the defense unit is forecast at 60 million
euros to 70 million euros, compared with a previous projection
of 130 million euros.  The company that supplies guns for the U.S. Abrams heavy
tank and pistons to General Motors Co. reduced its annual
defense sales forecast to 2.3 billion euros from 2.4 billion
euros.  Rheinmetall shares dropped 4.7 percent to 38.58 euros as of
