Chicago  fuels strengthened relative
to  New York  futures after  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  reduced rates at the
238,000-barrel-a-day Joliet,  Illinois , refinery, the fifth-largest plant in the U.S. Midwest.  The discount for  ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel in Chicago
narrowed 0.5 cent to 4.5 cents a gallon versus New York
Mercantile Exchange futures at 12:43 p.m. The  spread trimmed  for
a fifth day, the longest such streak since Nov. 16, 2012.  The  differential  for conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or
CBOB, narrowed by 4.75 cents to 6 cents a gallon below futures,
the strongest position since July 12.  The fuels rallied after regulatory filings showed that
Exxon’s  Joliet refinery  shut an “east co” boiler and cut rates
on July 26. The plant produces about 9 million gallons of
gasoline and diesel a day, according to the company’s website.  Tricia Simpson, a spokeswoman for Exxon, said the
information in the filings with the U.S. National Response
Center and Illinois Emergency Management Agency was accurate.
She declined to comment on day-to-day operations.  A cut in production at the plant may contribute to lower
supply of refined products in the area, where the Energy
Information Administration reported  distillate stockpiles  fell
to 28.8 million barrels on July 19. Gasoline inventories were
 49.1 million barrels .  The  3-2-1 crack spread  in Chicago, a rough measure of
refining margins for gasoline and  diesel fuel  based on West
Texas Intermediate oil in Cushing,  Oklahoma , widened $1.33 to
$19.20 a barrel, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
