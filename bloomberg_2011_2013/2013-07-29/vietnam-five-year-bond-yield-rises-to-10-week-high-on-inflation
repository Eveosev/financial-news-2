Vietnam ’s bonds fell, pushing the
five-year yield to a 10-week high, on speculation quickening
inflation and a surging  interbank rate  are damping demand. The
dong was little changed.  Consumer prices  rose 7.29 percent in July from a year
earlier, the most in 14 months, official figures show. The
overnight  interbank rate  climbed 3.84 percentage points this
month to 4.64 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Factors for an ongoing downtrend of bonds are lining up,
at least in the short-term, with higher inflationary pressure,
and continued high interbank rates,” Pham Luu Hung, associate
director of institutional research and investment advisory at
Saigon Securities Inc. in Hanoi, wrote in a research note today.  The five-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.48 percent, the highest since May 17,
according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by Bloomberg.
The yield increased 12 basis points last week.  The dong was little changed at 21,215 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The  State Bank 
of Vietnam set its reference rate at 21,036 today, unchanged
since June 28, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
