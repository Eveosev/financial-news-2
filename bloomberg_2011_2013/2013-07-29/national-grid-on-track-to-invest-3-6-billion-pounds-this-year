National Grid Plc (NG/) , the operator of
energy networks in the U.K., expects to invest 3.6 billion
pounds ($5.5 billion) to 3.9 billion pounds in the current
fiscal year.  The company, which today reported a “solid” financial
performance for the four-month period from April 1, said the
investment is consistent with its plan to grow its regulated
assets by about 6 percent a year over the “next few years.”  It plans to invest 1.3 billion pounds to 1.4 billion pounds
a year in the U.S. in transmission investments, upgrades to
existing infrastructure and the connection of new customers, it
said today in a statement. The network operator said there have
been no “material changes” to its financial performance from
April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
