Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, said first-half
profit jumped 44 percent, beating analyst estimates, helped by
accelerating growth in gross written premiums.  Net income climbed to $180.7 million pounds ($278 million)
in the six months to June 30 from 125.8 million pounds, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said today in a statement. That
beat the 115 million-pound median  estimate  of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross written premiums rose 12.3 percent
to 1.02 billion pounds after a 7 percent gain a year ago.  “Our strategy of building balance and diversification
within the business continues to work,” Hiscox said in the
statement. “We have taken advantage of improving markets and
grown our insurance businesses in the U.S., U.K.,  Europe  and in
the London Market, whilst continuing to underwrite reinsurance
very profitably.”  The shares jumped 2.4 percent to 625 pence at 8:04 a.m. in
London. They have increased about 22 percent this year.  Hiscox’s combined ratio, or claims and expenses as a
percentage of premiums, improved to 74.7 percent from 81.7
percent a year earlier, indicating improved underwriting in the
period, according to the statement. The company said that
reserves for “various 2010-2012 catastrophes are stable to
improving,” at 73.6 million pounds in the first half.  The company increased its dividend by 17 percent to 7 pence
in the first half, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
