Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) , the oil
explorer that’s expanding production in  Texas  and  Colorado ,
reported a second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’
estimates as output climbed.  Net income was $929 million, or $1.83 a share, compared
with a net loss of $89 million, or 18 cents, a year earlier, The
Woodlands, Texas-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Excluding one-time items such as a gain from energy contracts,
per-share earnings of $1.05 exceeded the 91-cent  average  of 30
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Daily sales volumes climbed 1.1 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier to the equivalent of about 750,000
barrels of oil, compared with a May forecast range of 736,000 to
758,000 barrels. Anadarko said costs including such items as
exploration expenses declined 33 percent.  “All in all, it was very strong,”  Fadel Gheit , an analyst
with Oppenheimer & Co. in New York who has an outperform rating
on Anadarko shares, said in a phone interview.  Anadarko said output for all of 2013 will be 281 million to
287 million barrels of oil equivalent, boosting its minimum
production from 279 million barrels. The company increased its
2013 daily forecast for natural gas output as it lowered its
expected crude oil projection to as much as 260,000 barrels a
day from as much as 268,000 a day. The company cited mechanical
issues as delaying a well in the  Gulf of Mexico , according to an
online operations  report .  Lower 48  Anadarko has the second-largest market value, behind
 ConocoPhillips (COP) , among U.S. oil and gas producers that don’t own
refineries or a chemical unit. Anadarko’s oil production has
been rising from such projects as Colorado’s Wattenberg field
and the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas.  Oil sales volumes from the lower-48 states rose about 26
percent from a year earlier to average 97,000 barrels a day in
the second quarter, according to the operations report. The
company also completed its first two Wolfcamp shale wells in
Texas during the quarter. Anadarko’s gas volumes from the
Marcellus Shale continued to climb, rising 63 percent from a
year earlier.  The company, along with partners, is exploring in offshore
basins and had five deep-water finds in the second quarter. That
included encountering oil at the Raptor and Yucatan prospects in
the Gulf and gas at Espadarte offshore  Mozambique , Anadarko
said. The Calao exploration well off  Ivory Coast  was determined
to be non-commercial, the company said in its operations report.  Revenue rose 8.5 percent from a year earlier to $3.5
billion in the second quarter.  Brent crude futures, a global benchmark, fell 5 percent
from a year earlier to average $103.35 a barrel in the second
quarter. Gas futures traded in New York averaged $4.018 per
million British thermal units in the quarter, a 71 percent
increase from a year earlier.  The earnings report was issued after the  close  of regular
trading on U.S. markets yesterday. Anadarko climbed 0.2 percent
to $88.65 at the close yesterday in  New York .  (Anadarko has scheduled an earnings conference call at 9
