German stocks  rose for the first
time in three days, with the benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index rebounding from
a weekly loss, as shares of automakers rallied.  Continental AG and Daimler AG each climbed at least 1.4
percent.  Siemens AG (SIE)  advanced 1.4 percent after saying it will
replace Chief Executive Officer  Peter Loescher .  Commerzbank AG (CBK) 
led banks lower, falling 2.3 percent.  The DAX gained 0.8 percent to 8,310.11 at 9:48 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The gauge retreated 1 percent last week as some
companies posted worse-than-estimated results. The broader HDAX
Index added 0.8 percent today.  In the U.S., a report at 10 a.m. New York time may show
pending home sales slipped 1 percent in June, after climbing 6.7
percent the previous month, according to the median forecast of
34 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
