Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the world’s second-biggest construction-equipment maker, said first-quarter
operating profit fell 5.9 percent, missing analysts’ estimates,
as sales to mining companies declined.  Operating profit was 52.4 billion yen ($535 million) in the
three months ended June 30, down from 55.7 billion yen a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based company said today in a statement. That
compares with the 61.7 billion yen estimate of five analysts in
a Bloomberg survey. Net income rose 16 percent to 37.3 billion
yen, aided by reduced tax payments.  Falling commodity prices have reduced mining activity in
 Indonesia  and Latin America, cutting into Komatsu’s sales of
high-margin mining equipment. The weakening of the yen and
increased spending on construction projects in  Japan  failed to
cover the overall decline.  Komatsu’s sales for the quarter fell 3.1 percent to 455.2
billion yen.  　  Caterpillar Inc., the world’s largest construction
equipment maker, last week cut its earnings forecast and posted
profit that trailed analysts’ estimates for a third straight
quarter as mining-equipment sales declined on slower commodity
demand from  emerging markets .  Komatsu fell 3.7 percent to 2,163 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. Earnings were released after the close.　  To contact the reporter on this story:
