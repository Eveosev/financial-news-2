The U.S. men’s soccer team captured
its fifth Gold Cup title with a 1-0 victory over  Panama  that
extended its record winning streak to 11 games.  Brek Shea scored the game’s only goal in the  69th minute 
yesterday at  Soldier Field  in Chicago, tapping in a crossing
pass in front of the net after  Landon Donovan  had initially
deflected it past Panama’s goalkeeper. Shea’s goal came 42
seconds after he came on as a substitute.  The U.S. won without coach Juergen Klinsmann, who was
suspended for the final after he was ejected for protesting a
challenge on one of his players in a 3-1 semifinal victory over
Honduras.  The U.S. had won the last of its four Gold Cup titles in
2007, two years after it beat Panama in the Central American
country’s only prior visit to the final.  Mexico had won the previous two editions of the biennial
tournament, which features national teams from North and Central
America and the Caribbean, and has a record six total titles,
one more than the U.S. Canada is the only other nation to claim
the trophy, in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
