Prima Reinsurance Plc, a Zambian
insurer, plans to raise about $4 million by the end of the year
in the country’s first initial public offering since 2008.  The proceeds will go toward meeting higher minimum  capital
requirements  proposed by Zambia’s government, while also
allowing Prima Re to take on riskier, bigger deals, Chairman
David Kombe said by phone from Lusaka, the capital.  “There’s a lot of potential in  Africa  as more and more
people start appreciating the value of insurance,” he said
today. “Africa’s been known to rely on reinsurance services
from outside, and Europe in particular. Now there’s a drive to
try and spread the risks within the region.”  Prima is seeking to take advantage of growth in a continent
that has less than 10 percent of the average global insurance
density per capita, according to the  African Insurance
Organisation . The company has already done business in countries
including  Egypt , Sudan,  Mozambique  and Uganda, Kombe said.  The last listing on the Lusaka Stock Exchange was Zambia
National Commercial Bank Plc, which sold shares to the public in
November 2008, Wala Chabala, chief executive officer of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said by mobile phone from
Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
