Corn extended declines to a 33-month
low and soybeans fell on speculation that U.S. crops will
benefit from cooler weather and rain in the next two weeks.
Wheat rose.  Temperatures will average below normal over much of the
Midwest in the next two weeks, helping to boost yields in areas
with adequate soil moisture and reducing stress on crops that
have not received significant rain this month, World Weather
Inc. said in a report today. Fields from  Kansas  to  Kentucky  will
get rain during the next two days and some crops in Nebraska and
 Iowa  will benefit from moisture beginning Aug. 1, the private
forecaster said.  “Corn and soybeans are in generally good condition, and
the weather remains favorable for the next two weeks,”  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading Co. in Fowler,  Indiana ,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s too early to start
worrying that current cool weather will result in early freeze
and crop losses until later in August.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.6 percent to
close at $4.7325 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, after touching $4.7125, the lowest for a most-active
contract since October 2010. Prices declined 4.9 percent last
week.  Soybean futures for November delivery dropped 0.7 percent
to $12.20 a bushel. Prices, which fell 3.6 percent last week,
touched $12.0725 on July 26, the lowest since Feb. 2, 2012.
Soybeans for delivery in August rose 1.3 percent after plunging
9.5 percent last week on increased farmer sales and slowing
demand from processors.  U.S. corn production may jump 29 percent to a record 13.95
billion bushels, while soybean output will rise 13 percent to
3.42 billion bushels, the government forecast July 11.  ‘Growing Rapidly’  “In most areas, the crops are growing rapidly, and
production figures are higher and rising,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said today in his daily Gartman Letter. “We may well
see a corn crop becoming steadily closer to 15 billion
bushels.”  Wheat futures for delivery in September rose 0.2 percent to
$6.515 a bushel in Chicago. Prices have declined 27 percent in
the past 12 months.  U.S. farmers harvested about 75 percent of the winter-wheat
crop as of July 21, down from an average 76 percent from 2008 to
2012, government data showed last week. USDA is scheduled to
update harvest progress later today.  “The harvest is winding down, and U.S. farmers are storing
remaining crops,” Gregg Hunt, a market analyst and broker at
Archer Financial Services Inc., said in a telephone interview.
“We are starting to see some demand developing after the break
in prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
