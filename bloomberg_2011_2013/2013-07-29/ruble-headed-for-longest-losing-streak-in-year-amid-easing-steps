The ruble headed for its longest
losing streak since June 2012 as Bank Rossii introduced new
measures to lower borrowing costs and crude oil sank.  The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter slid
for a sixth day, dropping 0.2 percent to 37.7212 against the
dollar-euro basket by 10:51 a.m. in Moscow. The ruble
depreciated 0.3 percent versus the dollar to 32.88 and by 0.2
percent against the euro to 43.64. The regulator sold the
equivalent of 6.51 billion rubles ($198 million) of foreign
currency on July 25, according to its website.  The central bank is accepting non-marketable assets as
collateral for one-year loans today for the first time and the
country’s biggest lenders are set to take all 500 billion rubles
offered, according to OAO  Rosbank (ROSB)  and VTB Capital. Crude fell as
much as 0.6 percent to $104.10 per barrel in  New York  today, the
second day of declines. The oil and natural-gas industries
contribute about 50 percent of  Russia ’s budget revenue.  “The ruble will continue to remain under pressure at the
start of the week due to the expectations of Bank Rossii’s
monetary easing, both in light of today’s auction and rate-cut
bets,” Anton Zakharov, foreign-exchange and commodities analyst
at OAO Promsbyazbank in Moscow, said by e-mail.  The drop in crude is also pushing the currency lower,
Zakharov said. He expects the ruble to weaken to 33.37 versus
the dollar by the end of the week.  Longer Funding  Elvira Nabiullina, who took over the central bank on June
24, is offering banks longer and cheaper funds to help funnel
cash into the economy needed to boost growth. Bank Rossii kept
its main lending rates unchanged for a 10th month in her first
decision as policy makers wait for inflation to drop within the
target range of 5 percent to 6 percent.  The yield on so-called ruble OFZ bonds due January 2023 was
steady at 7.37 percent.  Non-resident holdings of ruble-denominated sovereign notes
are now approaching the emerging-market average of 30 percent,
compared with 21 percent on Feb. 1 and 7 percent on July 1,
2012, the Moscow-based central bank said in a report on July 26.
Bank Rossii and the Finance Ministry plan to start monitoring
foreign ownership of OFZs to reduce risks.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emerging Currencies Index fell 0.2
percent to 90.844.  To contact the reporter on this story:
