Canadian stocks slid for a fifth
day, the longest stretch in seven weeks, as a decline in
commodity producers overshadowed a $2.6 billion acquisition by
Hudson’s Bay Co.  Hudson’s Bay, the operator of Canada’s largest department-store chain, surged 6.9 percent after agreeing to acquire luxury
U.S. retailer Saks Inc. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. slid 2
percent as an analyst at  Macquarie Research  downgraded his
rating on the stock. Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. fell 9
percent after parent Rio Tinto Group delayed work on a $5.1
billion underground expansion of a  copper mine  in Mongolia.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index lost 17.46
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,630.44 at 10:25 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge declined 0.3 percent last week. Trading volume was 32
percent lower than the 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
