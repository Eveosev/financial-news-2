The CBOE Futures Exchange LLC will
expand trading hours for  futures  linked to the benchmark gauge
for U.S. options prices by late September after delaying the
move following a trading outage earlier this year.  Futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index, or VIX, will trade in a new 45-minute period that begins
at 4:30 p.m. in New York, starting at the end of September based
on an e-mailed statement from the exchange. CFE will add five
hours before the current 8 a.m. start in a second phase
implemented during the following weeks.  The Chicago-based exchange is almost doubling trading on
the VIX futures as part of a move toward around-the-clock  market
access .  CBOE Holdings Inc. (CBOE) , which owns CFE, has said that it
intends to expand trading for VIX futures to 24 hours, five days
a week starting this year.  CBOE canceled a planned May 30 launch of the extended hours
after work in preparation for reconfiguring its computer systems
for the longer trading window caused an April 25 malfunction
that shut the CBOE for three-and-a-half hours.  The extensions mean the VIX contracts will trade from 3
a.m. to 4:15 p.m. five days a week. The evening session from
4:30 p.m. to 5:15 p.m. will mark the start of a new trading day
and be available Monday through Thursday, CFE said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
