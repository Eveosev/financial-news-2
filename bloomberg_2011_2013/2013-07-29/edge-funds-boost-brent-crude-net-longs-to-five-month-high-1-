Hedge funds  and other money managers
increased  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to their highest level in
more than five months, according to data from ICE Futures
 Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 191,433 lots in
the week ended July 23, the London-based exchange said today in
its weekly Commitments of Traders report. The increase of 10,033
contracts, or 5.5 percent, is the fourth consecutive weekly gain
and brings net-longs to their highest level since Feb. 12.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as hedge funds and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Bearish positions by  producers , merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 394,148, a fall
of 3.1 percent. Net-short positions in the week ended July 16
was the biggest since January 2011, the earliest available point
for the data.  Brent declined 0.9 percent in the week to July 23 to
$108.42 a barrel and traded at $107.51 as of 12:38 p.m. London
time.  Swaps dealers  reduced net-long positions by 8.6 percent to
232,463 in the week to July 23, the lowest since April 23.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  futures
rose a fourth week, gaining 13 percent to 62,808 contracts.
That’s the highest since March 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
