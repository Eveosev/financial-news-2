Natural gas futures extended a
decline from the lowest price in more than 20 weeks amid milder
U.S. weather that may reduce fuel demand from power plants.  Gas for August delivery fell as much as 2.3 percent to
$3.472 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange and was at $3.478 at 11:36
a.m. Singapore time. The contract dropped 2.4 percent on July 26
to $3.555, the lowest settlement since March 6.  Most of the eastern U.S. will experience seasonal
temperatures from July 31 through Aug. 9, with lower readings in
the Midwest, predicted MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . The government reported  below-average  gains in
stockpiles the previous two weeks as unusually hot weather
spurred electricity use.  The high temperature in New York City on Aug. 9 may be 76
degrees Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 8 below normal, and Atlantaâ€™s
reading may be 7 lower than the average at 81 degrees, according
to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
