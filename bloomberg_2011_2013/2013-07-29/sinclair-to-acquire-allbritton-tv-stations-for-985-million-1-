Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. (SBGI) ,
continuing its acquisition spree, agreed to buy TV stations
owned by the Allbritton family for $985 million, gaining ABC
affiliates and a 24-hour news network serving Washington, D.C.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter,
assuming it passes regulatory hurdles,  Hunt Valley , Maryland-based Sinclair said today in a statement. Under the terms of the
deal, the company is acquiring the stock of Perpetual Corp. and
the equity interest of Charleston Television LLC, which are both
owned by the Allbritton family.  Sinclair, the largest owner of TV stations in the U.S., had
already spent about $2 billion over the past two years on
acquisitions -- part of an industrywide wave of consolidation.
Investors have applauded the takeover run, sending Sinclair’s
shares up almost threefold over the past year.  “We are thrilled to add the Allbritton properties to our
growing portfolio and national footprint,” Sinclair Chief
Executive Officer  David Smith  said in the statement. “To buy a
full-blown news operation in our nation’s capital and an
infrastructure that allows us to be connected to our branches of
government and be at the pulse of national issues is a once-in-a
lifetime event.”  Sinclair’s stock rose 1 percent to $30.10 at the close
today in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
