Singing, dancing and acrobatics held
sway on Broadway, as “Pippin” sold $1.1 million of tickets,
its best week since opening and biggest jump in six weeks.  Sales rose by $41,000 for the show, which was directed by
Diane Paulus and won four Tony Awards, including for musical
revival.  “Kinky Boots,” the best new musical winner, also marked a
record, $1.6 million, up by almost $9,000, according to figures
released by the trade association the Broadway League.  Overall, Broadway sold $24.2 million of tickets, up 2
percent from a week ago.  Among new musicals in previews, “ First Date ” bounced back
37 percent to $444,000 after lead Zachary Levi returned to the
show from his sojourn at the Comic-Con International comic book
convention in San Diego. “ Soul Doctor ,” about the life and
music of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, tooko in $152,000 for seven
previews, less than a quarter of its potential.  Sales for the revival of “Annie” rose 1 percent to
$968,000. The Beatles tribute concert, “Let It Be,” dropped 8
percent, to $369,000. It opened Wednesday night and gave away
tickets all week to the press.  Summer tourists helped “Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark”
sell $1.4 million, its best week in nearly four months.  “ Forever Tango ,” in its third Broadway incarnation, sold
$484,000, up 13 percent in its third week.  Confirming the positive impact of a closing notice, the
Manhattan-set drama “The Assembled Parties” saw sales zoom 27
percent. It ended its Broadway engagement on Sunday.  Similarly, “Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike”
increased 3 percent in the final week for Sigourney Weaver in
Christopher Durang’s comedy. Julie White begins performances
tonight as Masha, a grandiose movie star with aging issues.  Muse highlights include  Jeremy Gerard  on theater and
