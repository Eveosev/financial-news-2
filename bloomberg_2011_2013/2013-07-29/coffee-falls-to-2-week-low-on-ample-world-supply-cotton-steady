Coffee futures fell to a two-week
low on signs of ample global supplies and few threats of weather
damage to crops in  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer and
exporter. Cotton was little changed.  As of July 26,  stockpiles  of coffee at warehouses monitored
by ICE Futures U.S. rose to the highest since late May, exchange
data show. Harvesting in Brazil will benefit from mostly dry
weather through Aug. 12 and no risk of freeze damage, Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia said today. Prices tumbled 15 percent
this year through July 26. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates global output will exceed demand for the fourth
straight season.  “The market understands that the surplus in production
against consumption prevails, and this should not change the
bearish behavior for prices,” Rodrigo Costa, a trading director
at Caturra Coffee Corp., wrote in a report for Sao Paulo-based
Archer Consulting, where he is a contributor. Producers are
using rallies to sell, he said.  Arabica coffee for September delivery slid 1.1 percent to
$1.2085 a pound at 11:17 a.m. on ICE in New York, after touching
$1.198, the lowest for a most-active contract since July 15.  Cotton futures for December delivery was up less than 0.1
cent at 85.15 cents a pound on ICE, after fluctuating between
gains and losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
