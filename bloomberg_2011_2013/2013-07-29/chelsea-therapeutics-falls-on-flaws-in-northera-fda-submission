     July 29 (Bloomberg) -- Chelsea Therapeutics International
Ltd. (CHTP)  fell as much as 12 percent after saying U.S. regulators
found formatting issues in its application for approval of its
Northera drug for fainting.  Chelsea declined 3.2 percent to $2.97 at 10:22 a.m.  New
York  time, after decreasing to $2.71 in its biggest intraday
drop since February. The  Food and Drug Administration  notified
the company that there were deficiencies in the electronic
datasets and statistical programs that will need to be fixed
before the application is complete,  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Chelsea said in a statement today.  The FDA said the incomplete submission isn’t related to
study conduct, interpretability of study results, or validity of
study conclusions, according to the statement. The company had
resubmitted the drug earlier this month after the FDA requested
additional data in March 2012.  The drug, also known as droxidopa, treats a condition known
as neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. It afflicts about 180,000
patients in the U.S. leading to dizziness, lightheadedness,
blurred vision and fainting, according to the company.  The FDA said a new deadline for its decision whether to
approve the drug won’t be set until the flaws are fixed and a
new submission is made. The company expects to present its
response in August, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
