Rubber slumped to the lowest level
in more than a week as  Japan ’s currency rebounded to a one-month
high, weakening the appeal of the yen-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in January lost as much as 3
percent to 242.7 yen a kilogram ($2,478 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, the lowest level since July 18.
Futures traded at 243.4 yen at 10:24 a.m., paring gains this
month to 3 percent.  The yen climbed to 97.78 per dollar, the highest level
since June 27, before the  Federal Open Market Committee  convenes
July 30-31. Reports this week are expected to show that U.S.
employers added fewer workers this month and economic growth
weakened in the second quarter.  “Data showing the weakness of the U.S. economic recovery
would strengthen the yen further against the dollar, leading to
sales of futures in Tokyo,” said Kazuhiko Saito, an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and other Fed members have said
any tapering of the central bank’s bond-purchasing program will
depend on risks to the economic outlook and job market abating.  Rubber for January delivery fell 2 percent to 17,805  yuan 
($2,904) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Natural-rubber
inventories climbed 2,678 tons to 117,933 tons, the bourse said
July 26, based on a survey of nine warehouses in Shanghai,
Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board fell 0.4 percent to 79 baht
($2.54) a kilogram on July 26, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
