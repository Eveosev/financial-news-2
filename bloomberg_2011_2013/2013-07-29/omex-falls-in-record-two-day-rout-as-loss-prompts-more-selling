Desarrolladora Homex SAB, (HOMEX*)  Mexico’s
biggest homebuilder by 2012 revenue, extended its two-day
selloff to a record after posting a record loss last week.  The shares fell 32 percent to 3.17 pesos today in Mexico
City trading, extending its two-day rout to 52 percent after the
company said July 25 that it had a 10.2 billion peso ($800
million) loss in the second quarter.  Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos
SAB (URBI*)  and Corp. Geo SAB, Homex’s main competitors, have been
suspended from stock trading after they failed to deliver
second-quarter results before the exchange’s July 26 deadline.  Homex, Geo and Urbi are preparing to restructure debt after
a change in federal housing policy shifted subsidies to
encourage city development over commuter towns, forcing builders
to move into new product lines and rendering some of their
current land holdings useless. Homex’s loss exceeded the 29
million peso loss analysts projected, as the Culiacan, Mexico-based company wrote down assets.  The company said today in a regulatory filing that the
stock selloff reflects “market conditions” and didn’t have
additional information to disclose that might explain the
“unusual movements” in its shares.  Homex’s bonds due in 2020 fell 1.56 cents to 27.20 cents on
the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
