Kao Corp. (4452) ,  Japan ’s biggest maker of
toiletries, cut its profit forecast to reflect the costs of
recalling skin whitening lotions that caused blotches in more
than 2,000 consumers.  The company cut its net income forecast for the year ended
December by 8.2 percent to 67 billion yen ($685 million) after
posting a special loss of 5.6 billion yen from the product
recall, it said in a stock exchange statement today.  Net income for the first half of the year will probably be
of 18.3 billion yen, 3.7 percent below previous forecast, it
said.  Kao’s Kanebo Cosmetics unit began recalling products
containing a whitening ingredient called “Rhododenol” earlier
this month after customers complained about a loss of
pigmentation. The company received more than 100,000 inquires,
and 2,250 people reported “depigmentation,” the company said
on July 23.  The recall involves 54 types of products including face
lotions and creams. Rhododenol is derived from a substance
Kanebo found in a search for natural chemical compounds in the
bark of the white birch tree, the company said on its website.
It discovered that one of these compounds confers strong
brightening effects by suppressing the production of melanin in
several stages, according to the website.  “The impact on the third quarter and fourth quarter will
be reflected in our future forecasts,” Shingo Sakai, a Kao
spokesman, said by phone today. The company is still assessing
the damage, he said.  Kao’s share dropped 3.7 percent to 3,005 yen in Tokyo
trading today, the lowest close since June 13. It cut its
forecast after the Japanese market closed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
