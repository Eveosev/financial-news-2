Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
shrank from the widest level this year on speculation that a
smaller corn supply will damp production of the biofuel.  The spread, or the price difference, between the two fuels
narrowed 2.99 cents to 78.65 cents a gallon. Ethanol  production 
has slumped for two consecutive weeks to the lowest level since
May 3, according to the Energy Information Administration, while
the Agriculture Department forecast that corn inventories before
the September harvest may be 26 percent below last year.  “The perception about what could happen in September may
be affecting what’s happening now,” said Mark Ruyack, a manager
at StarFuels Inc. in Jupiter,  Florida . “It seems like supply is
a little tight.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery slipped 0.2 cent to
$2.226 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
climbed 1.6 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery fell 3.19 cents, or 1 percent,
to $3.0125 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is mixed with gasoline as part of U.S. plans to
reduce dependence on foreign oil. A 2007 law, the Renewable
Fuels Standard, requires refiners to use 13.8 billion gallons of
the additive this year.  The fuel is made from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the additive.  Corn Supply  Ruyack said ethanol companies may be hesitant to sell some
of their supply because of concern that corn may be hard to
obtain before the harvest.  Ethanol  stockpiles  are down 9.2 percent to 17.3 million
barrels from a year earlier, data from the EIA, the Energy
Department’s research arm, show.  Production fell 2.6 percent to 853,000 barrels a day in the
week ended July 19, EIA data show, down 3.6 percent from this
year’s high in the week ended June 21.  Corn for September delivery decreased 2.75 cents to $4.8925
a bushel in  Chicago . The more-actively traded December contract
slipped 2.75 cents to $4.7325.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts, was 35 cents compared with 34 cents July
26.  Tracking certificates called Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, are used by the government and refiners to
monitor compliance with the energy law.  RINs Prices  Corn-based-ethanol RINs dropped 2 cents today to 97 cents,
while  advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol and biodiesel, were unchanged at $1, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in the U.S.
Gulf at $2.285 a gallon and on the West Coast at $2.535,
according to data collected by Bloomberg. In  New York  the
additive jumped 5 cents to $2.34 and in Chicago the price
decreased 0.5 cents to $2.20 a gallon.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf was unchanged
at 25 cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
expanded by 5.5 cents to 14 cents, the widest differential since
May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
