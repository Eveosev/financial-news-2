Gasoline fell as Tropical Storm
Dorian degenerated into a tropical wave, easing concern that it
would affect U.S. refining and fuel distribution. Crack spreads
narrowed.  Futures slipped as much as 1.2 percent. Dorian was
 downgraded  by the National Hurricane Center on July 27. Futures
rose 0.9 percent on July 26 and crack spreads widened on the
chance that Dorian might strengthen and approach the U.S. Gulf,
where 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity is located, or the
East coast, including  New York  Harbor, the delivery point for
New York Mercantile Exchange gasoline and diesel contracts.  “Gasoline should have opened down today because Tropical
Storm Dorian dissipated over the weekend,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. Lipow  August-delivery gasoline fell 3.32 cents, or 1.1 percent,
to $3.0112 a gallon at 10:06 a.m. on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Trading volume was 18 percent below the 100-day
average. Futures slipped 2.5 percent last week, the first weekly
loss in a month.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI sank 84 cents to $20.60
a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent narrowed 94 cents to
$18.03.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell a seventh
consecutive day, dropping 0.3 cent to $3.631 a gallon, Heathrow,
Florida-based AAA said today on its website. That’s the lowest
level since July 14. Prices are 14.6 cents higher than a year
earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery fell 0.73 cent
to $3.0028 a gallon on trading volume that was 18 percent below
the 100-day average. ULSD declined 2.6 percent last week, the
first loss in five weeks.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
widened 6 cents to $21.91 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  fell
5 cents to $19.33.  To contact the reporter on this story:
