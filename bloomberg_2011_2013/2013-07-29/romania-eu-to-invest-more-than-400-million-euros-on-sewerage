Romania  and the European Union will
invest more than 400 million euros ($530 million) to upgrade
wastewater infrastructure in Bucharest and nearby towns by 2020.  The European Commission  on July 26  approved investment of
130 million euros from its Cohesion Fund for the first phase of
the Glina water-treatment plant project to 2015, it said today
in a statement. Romaniaâ€™s contribution will bring investment to
258 million euros for the first stage of the project, it said.  A second phase from 2014 to 2020 will bring the total cost
to about 416.5 million euros, according to the statement.  Romania is investing in the water network of the capital
and regions with EU accession funds to bring the infrastructure
up to European health standards as aging systems struggle with
increasing demand. The project will reduce water loss, curb
operating costs and expand supply and sewage treatment.  Works include extending the Glina wastewater treatment
plant, building a sludge incinerator and upgrading sewer
collectors and the drainage system outlets of the Titan, Carol
and Tineretului lakes, according to the statement.  The EU has allocated a total of about 20 billion euros for
Romania, its second-poorest member after  Bulgaria , under the
cohesion policy from 2007 until 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
