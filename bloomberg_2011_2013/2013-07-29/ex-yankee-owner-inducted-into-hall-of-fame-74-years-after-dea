Former  New York  Yankees owner Jacob Ruppert, longtime umpire Hank O’Day and 19th-century player
Deacon White were inducted into baseball’s Hall of Fame
yesterday, getting in more than 70 years after their deaths.  The three had been selected for enshrinement by the hall’s
Pre-Integration Era Committee in December 2012. It was the first
time the induction class didn’t have any living members since
1965, when Pud Galvin was inducted posthumously in front of 22
of the 30 living Hall of Fame members.  The Baseball Writers Association of America didn’t elect
anyone to the Hall of Fame for the second time in the past 42
years, snubbing  Roger Clemens  and  Barry Bonds  in voting because
of links to performance-enhancing drugs. Clemens won a record
seven Cy Young Awards as the best pitcher in his league and
ranks ninth in Major League Baseball history with 354 wins,
while Bonds won a record seven Most Valuable Player awards and
is baseball’s all-time home-run leader with 762.  Each received about half of the vote percentage needed for
induction. They were among 24 former players on the ballot for
the first time and their eligibility created one of the sport’s
most highly debated and scrutinized votes.  Ruppert, a brewer who also served in the U.S. House of
Representatives, bought the Yankees in 1915 and transformed them
from a struggling franchise into one that would go on to win a
record 27  World Series  championships. He’s best remembered for
buying  Babe Ruth  from the  Boston Red Sox  and building the
original Yankee Stadium. Ruppert died in 1939.  O’Day umpired the first World Series in 1903, while White
was a bare-handed catcher who played from 1871 to 1890.  To contact the reporter on this story:
