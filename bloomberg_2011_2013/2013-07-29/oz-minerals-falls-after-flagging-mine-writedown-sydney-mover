OZ Minerals (OZL) , Australia’s third-biggest copper producer, fell to its lowest in almost two weeks
in Sydney trading after flagging a mine writedown of as much as
A$240 million ($223 million).  Shares in the Melbourne-based producer declined 1 percent
to A$4.09 at 11:10 a.m., its lowest since July 16. Australia’s
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 percent.  OZ Minerals cited lower expected copper and gold prices for
the writedown at its Prominent Hill project in  South Australia .
Copper has plunged about 14 percent this year on concern demand
will weaken as the economy slows in  China , the world’s top
consumer of the metal used in pipes and wires.  “With the fact that copper prices are under a bit of
pressure, it’s not surprising to see that kind of writedown,”
said Evan Lucas, a Melbourne-based market strategist at IG
Markets Ltd. “You would expect them to fall, and fall
further.”  OZ Minerals had been among companies that made final bids
for Rio Tinto Group’s Northparkes, a person with knowledge of
the matter said July 16. China Molybdenum Co. has agreed to pay
$820 million for Rio’s 80 percent stake in the Australian  copper
mine , the London-based company said today.  Evolution Mining Ltd. (EVN) , partly owned by Australia’s biggest
gold mining company, also fell after flagging a mine asset
writedown of as much as A$400 million. The stock fell 4.8
percent to 79.5 cents at 11:28 a.m., the most since July 10. It
has dropped 53 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
