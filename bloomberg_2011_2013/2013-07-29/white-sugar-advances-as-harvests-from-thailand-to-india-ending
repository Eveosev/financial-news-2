White sugar climbed for a third day,
sending the premium over raw sugar to a four-week high, as the
end of harvests in  Thailand  to India will curb supplies.  The  premium  for white, or refined, sugar over raw sugar
climbed to $119.42 a metric ton today, the highest since June
27. First notice of delivery from the October futures contract
for the white sugar is Sept. 16.  “The only supply for the October delivery will be
Brazil,” said  Naim Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Broker in
Rolle,  Switzerland , by phone today. “It may be one or more
trade houses are positioning for this on the long side.”  White sugar for October delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$482.50 a ton by 12:09 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . Raw sugar
for October delivery gained 0.2 percent to 16.50 cents a pound
on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Frost last week in Argentina’s Tucuman, the country’s
largest cane-producing state, caused damage, Green Pool
Commodity Speciality Pty in  Brisbane , Australia, said in a
report dated today. Temperatures were minus 2 Celsius to minus 5
Celsius (28 to 23 degrees Fahrenheit) on July 22 and July 24,
said Don Keeney, senior agriculture meteorologist at MDA Weather
Services in Gaithersburg, Maryland. There is no rain forecast in
sugar areas in  Brazil  the next 10 days, he said.  Cocoa fell 0.7 percent to $2,317 a ton on ICE and arabica
coffee rose 0.3 percent to $1.2265 a pound.  Robusta fell 0.3 percent to $1,915 a ton on NYSE Liffe and
cocoa dropped 0.5 percent to 1,560 pounds ($2,400) a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
