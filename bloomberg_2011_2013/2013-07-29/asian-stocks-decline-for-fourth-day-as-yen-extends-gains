Asian  stocks  dropped, with the
regional benchmark index heading for a fourth day of declines,
after the yen strengthened and resources shares slid after
 China ’s industrial profit slowed.  Toyota Motor Corp. slipped 4.1 percent in  Tokyo , pacing
losses among Japanese exporters as the yen traded near a one-month low to the dollar.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
 Japan ’s biggest publicly traded lender, dropped 4 percent,
extending its biggest weekly decline in two months. Jiangxi
Copper Co., China’s biggest producer of the metal, fell 2.2
percent in Hong Kong.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank 1.6 percent to 133.23 as
of 6:17 p.m. Tokyo time, with about seven shares falling for
each that rose. Japan’s Topix index last week posted its biggest
decline in more than a month as earnings from Advantest Corp.
and JFE Holdings Inc. disappointed and the yen gained.  “Investors are looking for bit of further direction in
Japan,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing director at White Funds
Management in Sydney, who helps oversee about $450 million.
“There are real concerns about the impact of China in the near
term. The announcements they’ve made last week about winding
back excess capacity and production in certain industries is
having a big impact.”  Japan’s Topix and the benchmark  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
both dropped 3.3 percent, the most since June 13. The nation’s
retail sales fell 0.2 percent last month compared to May,
figures today showed, missing the median estimate of a 0.8
percent gain in a Bloomberg survey.  Kuroda Comments  A planned sales-tax increase “won’t give major damage” to
the growth in Japan’s economy,  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech today in Tokyo. The country’s economic
growth will be moderate going forward, he said.  “Japan is in a summer lull,”  Jesper Koll , head of Japan
strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Tokyo, said on Bloomberg
Television. “Parliament will only reopen in the middle of
September. Between now and then, there’s no new initiatives
coming. There’s a lot of worry about the slowdown in China plus
the possible tapering of stimulus in the U.S.”  Industrial Profit  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slid 0.5 percent, while China’s
Shanghai Composite Index declined 1.7 percent. Profit at
mainland industrial companies increased 6.3 percent in June from
a year earlier, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics
said July 27, down from a 15.5 percent pace in May.  South Korea’s Kospi Index fell 0.6 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex
Index dropped 0.8 percent. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost 0.1
percent. Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  added 0.1 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 6.2 percent from this
year’s highest close on May 20 through last week amid signs
 China’s economy  is slowing and on concern the  Federal Reserve 
will start tapering monetary stimulus. Shares on the gauge
traded at 13.1 times estimated earnings as of July 26, compared
with 15.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.5
times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
added 0.1 percent in New York on July 26 as investors weighed
corporate earnings and economic data ahead of the Federal
Reserve meeting from July 30 to 31.  Yen Strengthens  Japanese exporters declined as the yen rose for a third day
against the dollar and headed for its strongest close since June
27. A stronger yen reduces the overseas income of carmakers and
electronics manufacturers when repatriated.  Toyota, the world’s biggest carmaker, decreased 4.1 percent
to 5,900 yen in Tokyo.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , which gets about 80
percent of sales outside of Japan, sank 5 percent to 1,042 yen.
Sony Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles, slipped 3.6 percent to 2,057 yen.  Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 4 percent to 603 yen.  Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. (8411) , Japan’s third-largest lender by market
value, fell 2.9 percent to 202 yen.  Resources Slide  Raw material producers declined as copper and crude oil
dropped after Chinese industrial profits indicated a deepening
slowdown.  Jiangxi Copper slipped 2.2 percent to HK$13.62 in  Hong
Kong .  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s biggest
producer of the lightweight metal, decreased 2.7 percent to
HK$2.54. Cnooc Ltd., the country’s biggest offshore oil
producer, fell 1.5 percent HK$14.06.  Hyundai Development Co. slumped 11 percent to 19,900 won in
Seoul after the South Korean builder reported a second-quarter
loss. Its share-price forecast was cut to 21,000 won from 28,000
won at Samsung Securities Co., which said profit margins may
continue to deteriorate.  Solar Tariffs  Solar-energy materials suppliers advanced after European
Union and Chinese negotiators reached an agreement to curb EU
imports of solar panels from China in exchange for exempting the
shipments from punitive tariffs.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , the world’s biggest producer
polysilicon used in making solar panels, rose 1.5 percent to
HK$1.99 in Hong Kong. Solargiga Energy Holdings Ltd., a maker of
silicon wafers, increased 2.5 percent to 41.5 Hong Kong cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
