Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , manager of
the Franklin and Templeton mutual funds, said fiscal third-quarter profit climbed 21 percent as rising global stock markets
boosted assets under management.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 increased to
$552.3 million, or 86 cents per share, from $455.3 million, or
71 cents, a year earlier, the  San Mateo , California-based
company said today in a statement. Analysts had expected
earnings of 85 cents a share, according to the average of 14
 estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Franklin benefited as gains in equity prices and deposits
into fixed-income funds lifted assets from the previous year.
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  rattled global markets
and pushed interest rates higher last month by outlining plans
to phase out the U.S. central bank’s asset purchases, triggering
a flight from bonds, which represent 45 percent of Franklin’s
assets under management.  “I don’t think the company is immune from the trends we
are seeing, but their scale and diversification should continue
to separate them from their peers,”  Michael Kim , an analyst
with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York, said in a
telephone interview before earnings were released. Kim has a buy
rating on the stock.  Investors around the world pulled a record $5.63 billion
from global bond funds in the week ended June 26, according to
data from Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR Global.  They withdrew $611 million from the $70 billion  Templeton
Global Bond Fund (TPINX)  in June, data from Chicago-based  Morningstar
Inc. (MORN)  show. The flagship fund, managed by  Michael Hasenstab ,
attracted more than $5.6 billion in the first five months of
2013.  Short-Term ‘Panic’  Hasenstab, who oversees more than $195 billion, beat 68
percent of peers this year and  91 percent  over the past five
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hasenstab, in a June 25 interview posted on Franklin’s
 website , described the bond selloff as a bout of risk-aversion.
“It pretty much happens every year at some point,” he said.
“So we’re not terribly concerned about these short-term periods
of panic.”  Franklin had $365.7 billion of its $815 billion in assets
in bonds as of June 30, the firm reported earlier this month.
Stocks accounted for 38 percent. Franklin’s assets grew 15
percent in the 12 months through midyear, helped by a 17 percent
gain in the MSCI All Country World Index, including dividends.  Franklin shares  fell  12 percent in June, making it the
second-worst performer in the 20-member Standard & Poor’s index
of asset managers and custody banks. After closing last week at
$48.66, the shares gained 16 percent in 2013, compared with 30
percent for the index.  New Chairman  The company last month named  Greg Johnson  chairman of the
firm after his father,  Charles Johnson , retired. Greg Johnson,
52, is the chief executive officer and president of the company.
His father was CEO from 1957 to 2003.  Franklin declared a 3-for-1  stock split  on June 13 that
altered the earnings per share originally reported in 2012.
Companies typically split their stock when they determine the
share price has become too high for individual investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
