George “Boomer” Scott, who won
eight Gold Glove awards for his defense and played more games at
first base for the  Boston Red Sox  than any player in team
history, has died. He was 69.  Scott’s family confirmed that he died of natural causes in
his hometown of Greenville, Mississippi, the  Red Sox  said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  Scott, a right-handed power hitter who liked to call his
home runs “taters,” spent nine of his 14 Major League Baseball
seasons with the Red Sox and is Boston’s all-time leader at
first base with 988 games played, including 944 starts. He hit
154 of his 271 career home runs with the Red Sox and was
inducted into the team’s Hall of Fame in 2006.  “In losing George Scott, we have lost one of the most
talented, colorful and popular players in our history,” said
Red Sox team historian Dick Bresciani, who has been with the
club since 1972. “He had great power and agility, with a large
personality and a large physical stature. He could light up a
clubhouse with his smile, his laugh, and his humor -- and he was
the best defensive first baseman I have ever seen.”  Scott was a member of Boston’s 1967 team that went to the
 World Series , losing to the  St. Louis Cardinals  in seven games.
He won the first of his Gold Gloves that season while
batting .303 and driving in 82 runs.  Scott made his major-league debut the previous season, when
he hit 27 home runs and had 90 runs batted in, the second-most
by a Red Sox player in his first year behind only  Ted Williams ,
who had 31 homers and 145 RBI in 1939. Scott would play all 162
games as a rookie, marking the last time a Red Sox infielder
played every game in a season.  Scott also spent five seasons with the  Milwaukee Brewers 
and played briefly for the Kansas City Royals and  New York 
Yankees in addition to Boston during his final season in 1979. A
three-time All-Star, Scott led the American League in 1975 with
109 runs batted in with the Brewers and tied Hall of Famer
 Reggie Jackson  with a league-best 36 home runs that season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
