The ringgit touched a five-week low
and government bonds fell as the prospect of weakness in  China’s
economy  dimmed the outlook for Malaysian shipments.  The Purchasing Manager’s Index in Asia’s largest economy
and Malaysia’s second-biggest export market dropped to the
lowest level in 10 months in July, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due Aug. 1. The
Southeast Asian nation’s  overseas shipments  fell in each of the
four months through May from a year earlier, the longest losing
streak since 2009, official data show.  The ringgit fell 0.3 percent to 3.2171 per dollar as of
9:42 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.2198, the lowest since June 24, and has
retreated 1.8 percent for the month and 5 percent for the year.  “Regional exports have been weak and  China ’s PMI fuels
more concern,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist at Societe
Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “The Malaysian currency could weaken
further with support at 3.2558.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 41 basis
points, or 0.41 percentage point, to 8.12 percent.  The yield on the 3.26 percent government bonds maturing
March 2018 increased one basis point to 3.63 percent, the
highest since the debt was sold, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
