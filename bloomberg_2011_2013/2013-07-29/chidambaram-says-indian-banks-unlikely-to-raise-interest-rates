Indian lenders are unlikely to raise
interest rates after the central bank tightened liquidity this
month to steady the currency, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said.  The government will ensure there will be no disruption by
the banking industry in meeting credit demands of companies to
expand their businesses, Chidambaram said in a conference in the
western Indian city of Ahmedabad today.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India , which reviews monetary policy
tomorrow, this month raised two interest rates and drained
liquidity to steady the rupee, joining Brazil and  Indonesia  in
tightening to check currency volatility. The steps were in
contrast to the lowering of the  benchmark  rate three times this
year as Indian growth weakened to the slowest pace in a decade.  “I don’t expect these liquidity measures to result in an
increase in the bank lending rates,” Chidambaram said. “Bank
rates have been stable and all chairpersons of banks have told
me that they have no plan to increase their bank lending rate.”  The rupee has slumped about 9 percent in the past three
months versus the dollar, hurt by a record current-account
deficit and reduced demand for emerging-market assets. The
currency, which touched an all-time low on July 8, declined 0.5
percent to 59.3450 per dollar as of 2:58 p.m. in Mumbai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
