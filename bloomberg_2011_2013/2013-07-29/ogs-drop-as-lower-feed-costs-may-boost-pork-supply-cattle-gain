Hog futures slumped for the third
straight session on speculation that lower feed costs will
increase pork supplies. Cattle rose.  Corn prices fell to a 33-month low today as rain and
improved conditions boosted prospects for a record crop in the
U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter. Corn is the
main ingredient in livestock feed. Average hog weights in the
 Iowa  and southern Minnesota region were 271.1 pounds (123
kilograms) in the week ended July 20, down 0.9 pounds from a
week earlier, government data show.  “Feed costs have dropped off, and hogs should be more
profitable,” Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a telephone interview from Yates City,
 Illinois . “We could possibly see more meat, heavier hogs with
the cheaper feed.”  Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.3 percent to
84.525 cents a pound at 9:57 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices slipped 0.2 percent last week.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.2635 a pound on the CME. Prices were down 4.9 percent this
year through July 26.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement added 0.4
percent to $1.532 a pound.  Wholesale- beef  prices fell 1.1 percent last week, the 10th
straight decline, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
That’s the longest losing streak since at least 2004. Prices are
down 11 percent since reaching $2.1137 a pound on May 23, the
highest since at least 2004.  “I am expecting the beef to attract some business,”
Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
