British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  will
start selling its first electronic cigarettes in the U.K. online
tomorrow with plans to introduce them in retail outlets by
September.  Europe’s largest cigarette maker plans to offer a
disposable e-cigarette called ‘Vype’ on its website, the company
said in a statement today. The classic Vype will cost 6.99
pounds ($11) and deliver around 130 puffs of pharmaceutical-grade nicotine, according to the website.  BAT spent about 40 million pounds last year to buy U.K.-
based CN Creative Ltd., which makes e-cigarettes -- battery-powered devices that deliver a vaporised dose of nicotine and
light up when puffed. The company may face regulatory
constraints after a U.K. government agency last month said e-cigarettes and all other nicotine-containing products should be
licensed as medicines to ensure safety.  Manufacturers will need to present data on the quality of
their products, on how they deliver nicotine to the body and on
how they compare with other nicotine-replacement products by
2016, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
said June 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
