Spain ’s government is studying
whether it can force industrial consumers of electricity to give
up some of the 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) of state aid
they receive annually, Expansion newspaper reported.  The companies targeted are those that earn money by
generating power using excess heat from their industrial
processes and at the same time get paid a stipend for agreeing
to suspend electricity consumption when supplies are tight,
Expansion said, without citing a source for the information.  Power users such as factories and smelters earn about 700
million euros a year for agreeing to such “interruptibility”
although the emergency measure hasn’t been used in more than a
decade, according to the news report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
