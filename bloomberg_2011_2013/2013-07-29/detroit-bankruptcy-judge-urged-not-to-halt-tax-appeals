Detroit ’s $18 billion bankruptcy
shouldn’t halt efforts by property owners to lower their taxes,
a company that advises them said in a court filing seeking an
exemption from federal court rules.  Michigan  Property Tax Relief LLC filed a motion asking the
judge overseeing the bankruptcy to let property owners file tax
appeals. The company has several dozen clients that have been
blocked by the Michigan Tax Tribunal from appealing their tax
bills because of the bankruptcy, the company said in a court
filing.  The company’s “clients desire to simply adjudicate the
amount of their tax liability,” Michigan Property Tax Relief
said in court papers filed today. “They are not seeking to file
any collection actions or pursue any tax refunds at this time.”  Lawsuits and other legal actions against the city were
automatically halted when Detroit filed the biggest U.S.
municipal bankruptcy earlier this month. The company asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes to allow the property tax appeals
to proceed.  The case is City of Detroit, 13-bk-53846,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit).  To contact the reporters on this story:
