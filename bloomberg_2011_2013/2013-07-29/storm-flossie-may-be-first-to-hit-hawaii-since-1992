Flossie weakened to a depression as it neared the Hawaiian Islands, while tropical-storm warnings were discontinued.  The system, with top winds of 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour, was 65 miles north-northwest of Honolulu and 270 miles northwest of Hilo at about 11 p.m. local time yesterday, according to an advisory from the  Central Pacific Hurricane Center  in Honolulu. It was moving west-northwest at 18 mph.  Flossie had threatened to become the first major system to strike  Hawaii  in 21 years. The state hasnâ€™t been hit by a tropical storm or hurricane since Hurricane Iniki in 1992, said Kristina Pydynowski, a meteorologist at AccuWeather.com, a forecaster in State College,  Pennsylvania .  The U.S. Coast Guard re-opened the ports of Hilo and Kawaihae on the Big Island at 1 p.m. yesterday, while keeping the port of Kahului, Maui closed, it said in a  statement  on its website yesterday.
