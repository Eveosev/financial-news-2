Indian stocks dropped for a fourth
day, the longest losing run in two months, after the nation’s
biggest bank said the central bank may raise interest rates and
 Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR)  slid on analysts downgrades.  State Bank of India  fell to its lowest close in 18 months.
Chairman Pratip Chaudhuri said the  Reserve Bank of India  may
raise the key interest rate and cash reserve ratio at its
meeting tomorrow in a move to defend the rupee. Hindustan
Unilever had its biggest loss in six months after the stock was
reduced by Macquarie Group Ltd. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Software exporter  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  surged the most in four years after
forecasting record sales.  The S&P BSE Sensex lost 0.8 percent to 19,593.28 at the
close in Mumbai. The gauge fell 2 percent last week as the RBI
raised two interest rates, curbed lenders’ access to funds and
limited trades in currency derivatives to steady the rupee.
Chaudhuri’s views contradicts 31 of 32 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey who predict no change to the benchmark rate, while 29 of
30 expect the reserve ratio to remain unchanged at 4 percent.  “Investors are concerned that the RBI commentary might be
hawkish,” Supreeth S.M., the chief executive officer at Quant
First Asset Advisors  India , said by telephone from Bangalore.
“There’s concern the central bank may signal a reversal in the
interest-rate easing cycle.”  The central bank’s decision is due at 11 a.m.  Unilever Outlook  Hindustan Unilever slumped 3.8 percent to 638.55 rupees,
the sharpest drop since Jan. 23. Earnings may grow at a slower
pace amid slowing sales and narrowing profit margins, JPMorgan
said in a report dated yesterday. Muted growth in the company’s
personal-care products business is a disappointment, Macquarie
said in a report today.  Cigarette maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  decreased 2.8 percent to 357.95
rupees. Hindustan Unilever and ITC have a combined 16 percent
weighting in the Sensex, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  State Bank fell 1.4 percent to 1,740.05 rupees, the lowest
close since Jan. 11, 2012.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the largest lender by
market value, slid 1.8 percent to 632.5 rupees, a fourth day of
declines. The CNX Bank Index lost 1.3 percent to 10,331.  Wipro Forecast  Wipro surged 6.8 percent to 408.05 rupees, the most since
July 2009. Wipro joins larger rival  Tata Consultancy Services
Ltd. (TCS)  in signaling higher demand for outsourced software work by
forecasting revenue from the business to rise as much as $1.65
billion in the September quarter. The guidance is the strongest
in more than two years, according to Espirito Santo Securities.  The Sensex  trades  at 13.7 times estimated 12-month
earnings, compared with the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10
times. Four of the 13 Sensex members that have announced
earnings so far for the June quarter missed analyst estimates.  International investors  bought a net $49.1 million of local
shares on July 26, taking this year’s net purchases to $12.3
billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They have sold $1
billion of  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks this month, the most among 10 Asian
markets tracked by Bloomberg.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange fell 0.9
percent to 5,831.65. India VIX, which gauges the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, advanced 8.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
