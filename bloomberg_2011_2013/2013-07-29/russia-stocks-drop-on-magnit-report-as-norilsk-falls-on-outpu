Russian equities dropped as OAO
Magnit tumbled on concern the nation’s biggest food retailer may
be forced to close stores in Moscow.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  lost 0.2 percent to 1,400.05 by
1:12 p.m. in Moscow after a 1.3 percent decline last week.
Magnit fell 2 percent to 8,030.50 rubles in Moscow and slid 2.7
percent to $58.35 in  London . OAO GMK  Norilsk Nickel , the world’s
biggest producer of the metal, sank 0.9 percent to 4,569 rubles.  Magnit retreated as much as 3 percent after the Vedomosti
newspaper reported Moscow mayor  Sergei Sobyanin  called for
health inspectors, police and the migration service to check the
company’s Moscow stores and “take measures to close them.”
Nickel production in the second quarter fell 5 percent from a
quarter earlier, Norilsk said today.  “The market doesn’t like probes,” Ivan Kushch, an analyst
at VTB Capital in Moscow, said by phone. “Although there would
be little financial impact for Magnit from the Moscow store
closures, this creates negative sentiment.”  A Magnit spokesman, who declined to be identified, citing
company policy, declined to comment on the report. The company
is the best performer on the Micex with a 66 percent gain this
year and has the fourth-biggest weighting at 6.1 percent.  OAO Uralkali, the world’s largest potash producer, slumped
1.8 percent to 186.02 rubles, poised for the lowest since
December 2010.  Billionaire Sells  Billionaire  Alexander Nesis  sold shares in Uralkali on July
26 two weeks after the company bought out fellow shareholder
Zelimkhan Mutsoev for $1.3 billion. The shares were sold “in
several small stakes on and off the market, with buyers
representing several portfolio investors,” Uralkali said in the
statement.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  was little changed at
1,347.75.  Russia ’s equities trade at the cheapest valuations
based on estimated earnings among 21 emerging economies tracked
by Bloomberg.  Russia’s central bank is accepting non-marketable assets as
collateral for one-year loans today for the first time and the
country’s biggest lenders are set to take all 500 billion rubles
($15.3 billion) offered, according to OAO Rosbank and VTB
Capital.  Russia’s economy grew 1.6 percent in the first three
months, spurring calls for easing. Bank Rossii kept its main
lending rates unchanged for a 10th month as policy makers wait
for inflation to drop within the target range of 5 percent to 6
percent.  Volume Drops  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 44 percent
below the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show, while
10-day  price swings  fell to 12.01. The 50-member Micex’s 5.1
percent decline in 2013 compares with a 1 percent increase for
 India ’s benchmark Sensex Index and a 19 percent loss for
 Brazil ’s  Ibovespa Index. (IBOV)   The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex subsided to
57.4 from 58.6 on July 26. The RSI measures how rapidly prices
have advanced or dropped during a specified time period.
Readings below 30 indicate a security may be poised to rise,
while those above 70 signal a potential drop.  The Russian Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in RTS futures, surged 7.9 percent, the first advance
after six days of declines. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. decreased 0.5
percent to 91.16 on July 26, the third day of declines.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 10 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
