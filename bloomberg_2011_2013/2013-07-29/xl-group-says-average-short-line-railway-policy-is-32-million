XL Group Plc. (XL) , the only property-and-casualty insurer named in a class-action lawsuit for
 Canada ’s worst rail disaster in a century, said that the average
size of a railway policy is about $32 million.  “We’ve got experienced rail underwriters” who are under
“strict risk-aggregation limits to control our exposures,”
Gregory Hendrick, chief executive officer of insurance
operations for XL Group, said today in a conference call
following second-quarter earnings. The average policy coverage
amount for North American short-line railroads is $32 million
gross and $19 million net, he said.  XL Group said on July 10 that it’s among insurers of
Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway Ltd., the company whose 73-car oil train derailed and crashed on July 6 in the center of
Lac-Megantic,  Quebec , killing 47 people and leveling much of the
downtown. Two residents filed an application on July 15 for a
class-action lawsuit, which names XL Group among other parties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
