BRF SA (BRFS3) , the world’s largest meat
processor by market value, climbed to the highest in almost a
month after earnings before items exceeded analysts’ estimates
in the  second quarter .  Shares rose 1.4 percent to 48.75 reais at 11:37 a.m. in Sao
Paulo after reaching 49.01 reais, the highest intraday since
July 1. The benchmark Ibovespa fell 0.8 percent.  Net income soared 33-fold to 208.4 million reais ($92
million), or 24 centavos a share, from 6.39 million reais, or 1
centavo, a year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said today.
Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, of 910 million reais excluding some
items beat the 841 million-real average of seven analysts’
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Earnings rose after prices for domestic meat product were
raised by an average 18 percent, while costs to feed its chicken
and pork fell, BRF said. Average soybean prices in  Chicago  fell
1.2 percent in the quarter, while corn remained almost
unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
