The damage to Burgundy’s wine region
from hail storms that pounded vineyards in villages including
Pommard and Volnay last week may cut the 2013 vintage by as many
as 4 million bottles, regional council estimates show.  Hail, floods and high winds damaged 1,350 hectares (3,336
acres) of vineyard in the  Cote de Beaune  area that produces some
of Burgundy’s most prized wine, council spokesman Benoit
Chaumont said by phone today. Potential losses amount to about
15 percent of the 27 million bottles produced in Cote de Beaune
in 2011, data from the  Burgundy Wine Board  show.  In Cote de Beaune, vineyards from Meursault in the south to
Savigny-les-Beaune in the north were damaged by thunderstorms
and hail on July 24, according to the board. The potential
production loss is as much as 30,000 hectoliters (792,520
gallons), Chaumont said.  “The premier crus were hit, that’s for sure,” Chaumont
said. “As far as I know, no grand crus were affected.”  In the north of Pommard, 70 percent to 90 percent of vines
were damaged, while 30 percent to 70 percent suffered in
southern Pommard and neighboring Volnay.  Burgundy production fell last year on a combination of late
frost, hail, disease and poor fruit set. The region has  France ’s
most expensive wine real estate, with some grand cru properties
fetching 3.8 million euros ($5 million) a hectare, according to
the  Agriculture Ministry .  The region’s entire production amounted to 1.51 million
hectoliters in 2011, the equivalent of 200 million bottles,
according to the wine board. The vintage included 122 million
bottles of white and 62 million of reds.  Premier Crus  The hail destroyed vines in a stretch of Cote de Beaune
about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to 3 kilometers wide and 10
kilometers long, according to Chaumont. He said the prestigious
premier crus were hit harder than the village appellations.  “It’s catastrophic, but not all of Burgundy was hit,”
Mathilde Paturaud, a spokeswoman for the wine board, said by
phone on July 26. “It’s bad luck for some because they’re hit
for the second time, particularly in Volnay.”  The Cote de Beaune area on July 24 received 50 millimeters
(2 inches) of rain over a 20-minute window, according to
Paturaud. She said an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of
winemakers in the affected area are insured.  The road between Pommard and Volnay was flooded by torrents
of mud running from vineyards, winemaker Jean Yves Devevey wrote
on his  blog  last week, describing hailstones the size of marbles
and ping-pong balls. He estimated losses in his Beaune vineyard
at 70 percent to 80 percent.  The ministry this month forecast Burgundy and Beaujolais
appellation wine volume would jump 34 percent to 2.31 million
hectoliters, recovering from a 30 percent slump last year.
Burgundy production last year fell about 20 percent below
average, according to the wine board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
