German lawmakers approved their
country’s share of rescue aid to  Greece  after Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras’s government agreed to fulfill all terms tied to
the help.  The German lower house, represented by members of the
Budget Committee, was given until noon today Berlin time to
query the payment. None of the committee members summoned a
meeting to question the aid, Christian Majewski, deputy
administrative head of the panel, said by telephone today.  “We didn’t hear from committee members at the deadline so
that means parliament authorizes the government to make the
payment,” Majewski said. The  Finance Ministry  had recommended
to the committee that it approve the aid, spokesman Martin Kotthaus told reporters in Berlin separately today.  Backing for the latest payment removes a potential block on
aid of 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Greece. The deadline
for a German decision on the measure was put back last week
until Greece had shown that it met all 22 so-called prior
actions tied to third-quarter payments.  While euro-area governments approved release of the aid on
July 26, the German parliament secured special rights from
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s government to vote on such payments.
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told Deutschlandfunk radio
in an interview yesterday that Europe must keep up pressure on
Greece to stand by its austerity pledges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
