 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  said in its Annual

day to Asian customers up from 1.39 million barrels in 2011.  Saudi exports to Europe rose to 991,000 barrels a day in
2012 from 890,000 in 2011. Iran’s shipments plunged to 162,000
barrels a day last year from 741,000 barrels a year earlier.  Exports from all OPEC nations rose to 25.3 million barrels
a day in 2012 from 23.5 million, the report showed.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria ,  Angola , Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
