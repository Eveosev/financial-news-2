None of the $47 million that the
U.S. Agency for International Development has spent on a program
to stabilize  Afghanistan  has gone to addressing the sources of
instability, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction said today.  An audit found that after 16 months, none of the agency’s
essential program objectives have been met and the $47 million
has been spent mostly on workshops and training sessions. The
project is aimed at bolstering Afghanistan’s government before
the planned U.S. troop withdrawal next year..  “It’s troubling that after 16 months, this program has not
issued its first community grant,” Special Inspector General
John Sopko said.  “Rather, it has spent almost $50 million, about a quarter
of the total program budget, on conferences, overhead and
workshops,” Sopko said. “This looks like bad value for U.S.
taxpayers and the Afghan people.”  The failure of USAID, part of the State Department, to use
the money for grants has left local Afghan communities
disappointed and may feed greater instability, the audit found.  “Participants in one of the regional programs are
experiencing ‘fatigue’ with the many planning workshops,” Sopko
wrote. “Such disappointment may actually result in further
destabilization and dissaffection toward the Afghan
government.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
