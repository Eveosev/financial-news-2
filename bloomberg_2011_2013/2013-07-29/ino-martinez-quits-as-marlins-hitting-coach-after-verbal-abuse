Tino Martinez, who was a member of
four World Series-winning teams with the  New York  Yankees,
stepped down as the Miami Marlins’ hitting coach after several
players accused him of verbal abuse.  “I want to apologize to the Marlins organization for my
behavior,” Martinez, 45, told reporters yesterday. “I have
made some comments to certain players at certain times that I
thought was more constructive criticism. Obviously, they didn’t
feel that way and it kind of backfired on me.”  Martinez, in his first year as a coach, had verbal spats
dating back to spring training with players including Chris Valaika, Chris Coghlan and Casey Kotchman, MLB.com reported. He
was also accused of grabbing prospect Derek Dietrich by the neck
during batting practice, which he denied.  “I did grab Dietrich in the cage one day by his jersey,”
Martinez said. “I never grabbed him by his neck.”  The Marlins announced Martinez’s resignation after he sat
in the dugout for yesterday’s 3-2 win over the Pittsburgh
Pirates. A replacement may be appointed today, MLB.com said.  “ We’ve accepted Tino Martinez’s resignation as hitting
coach,” Marlins President of Baseball Operations Larry Beinfest
said. “We will get back to you in short order on a
replacement.”  Martinez had a 16-year Major League Baseball playing career
with four teams before spending five seasons with the Yankees as
a special assistant.  “I thought I was correct in the way I was doing things,”
Martinez said yesterday. “I just maybe overreacted. I should
have handled it a whole different way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
