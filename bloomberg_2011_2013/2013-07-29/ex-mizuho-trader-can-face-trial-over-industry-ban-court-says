A former Mizuho International Plc
trader, who was cleared of manipulating the price of coffee
futures, faces a trial over whether he lied during the markets
regulator’s investigation.  The Financial Conduct Authority can try to ban David Hobbs
from working in the industry after a U.K. appeals court ruled
today. Hobbs had won a case in November against the regulator,
which was attempting to fine and ban him for committing market
abuse.  The regulator appealed the ruling in December, seeking to
ban Hobbs for lying during the probe. It didn’t challenge the
finding that Hobbs hadn’t committed market abuse.  The tribunal must “address the question whether, even if
Mr. Hobbs was not guilty of market abuse, his lying, which it
found as a fact, demonstrated that he was not a fit and proper
person,” Judge Stanley Burnton said in the ruling.  The  law firm  representing Hobbs, Wilmer Cutler Pickering
Hale & Dorr LLP, did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. FCA spokesman  Chris Hamilton  declined to immediately
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
