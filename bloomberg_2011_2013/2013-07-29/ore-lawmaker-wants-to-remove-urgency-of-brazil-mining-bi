Congressman Leonardo Quintao,
responsible for presenting report on  mining industry  bill,
speaks by phone from  Belo Horizonte .
* Wants to set schedule for presenting in 60 to 90 days after
Congress resumes next week, incorporating discussion on
amendments proposed by lower-house members
* Says presented 372 changes to govt’s June 18 proposal
* Department responsible for granting exploration licenses lacks
resources to process all requests, Quintao says
* President Rousseff’s secretariat of Institutional Relations,
responsible for Congress negotiations, said in an e-mailed
response that they are aware of Quintao’s request and that they
will evaluate it, but is important that Congress debate the
project as soon as possible because the restructuring of the
mining industry is strategic for the country development
