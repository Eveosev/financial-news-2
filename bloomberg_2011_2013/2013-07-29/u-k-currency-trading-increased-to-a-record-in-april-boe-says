U.K. currency-trading volumes rose
to a record $2.55 trillion a day in April, 26 percent higher
than in October, the  Bank of England  said today, citing a twice-yearly  survey .  The increase was aided by a “substantial” jump in trading
of the dollar against the yen, which more than doubled, the
London-based central bank said in a statement on its website.  Spot foreign-exchange trading surged 38 percent to more
than $1 trillion a day, also a record, according to the survey,
carried out for the Bank of England’s Foreign Exchange Joint
Standing Committee.  Thirty banks participated in the survey, the Bank of
England said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
