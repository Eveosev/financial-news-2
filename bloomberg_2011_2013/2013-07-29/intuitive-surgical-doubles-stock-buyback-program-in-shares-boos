Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG)  doubled its
stock repurchase program to $1.5 billion, sending shares of the
embattled maker of robot surgery devices up the most in two
months.  The board approved the repurchase of $779 million of
shares, adding to the $721 million that was already authorized
under the program, the Sunnyvale, California-based Intuitive
said today in a statement. As part of the program, Intuitive
will buy back $500 million of its shares from  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) , with the majority expected to be bought within two
weeks.  Intuitive shares had fallen by a third since  Bloomberg News 
reported in February that U.S. regulators were surveying
surgeons about the company’s robots following a rise in reports
that included as many as 70 deaths since 2009. Reports of
injuries involving robot procedures have doubled in the first
six months of 2013 compared with a year earlier, Food and Drug
Administration records show.  “We will have to wait for some time to see if management
will be successful in buoying or stabilizing the stock,” said
Suraj Kalia of Northland Securities Inc. in a telephone
interview.  Intuitive  rose  2.3 percent to $391 at the close of trading
in  New York , the shares’ largest single-day climb since May 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
