The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside  Japan  fell, credit-default swap traders said.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 3 basis points to 137 basis
points as of 8:14 a.m. in Singapore,  Australia  and New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. prices show. The benchmark has ranged from
127.5 and 163 basis points this month, according to data
provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 3 basis points
to 117 as of 10:14 a.m. in Sydney, according to ANZ prices. The
gauge, which has ranged from 113 to 139.8 this month, is poised
for its biggest one-day fall since July 22, according to CMA,
which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index advanced 0.5 of a basis point
to 99 basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
