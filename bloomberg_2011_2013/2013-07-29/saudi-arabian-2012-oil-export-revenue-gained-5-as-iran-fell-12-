Saudi Arabia ’s revenue from exports
of crude oil and other petroleum products in 2012 rose 5.3
percent from a year earlier while Iran’s income from sales
abroad sank by 12 percent, OPEC reported.  The world’s largest crude exporter shipped oil and products
valued at $336.1 billion last year, up from $319.1 billion in
2011, the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  said in
its Annual Statistical Bulletin today. The kingdom’s export
revenue advanced at a slower pace than the 49 percent gain in
2011, the data showed.  Saudi shipments of crude and refined petroleum products
rose 3.7 percent to an average of 8.42 million barrels a day
last year, according to the data posted on OPEC’s website today.
Iranian petroleum export revenue fell to $101.5 billion as the
nation’s shipments fell 14 percent to an average of 2.56 million
barrels a day, OPEC said.  OPEC’s petroleum exports revenues were $1.26 trillion last
year, 9.2 percent more than the revised $1.15 trillion for 2011,
the data showed. For some members the revenue data may include
condensates or other natural gas liquids as well as crude and
refined products, and some OPEC nations import substantial
amounts of crude and products thus lowering net revenue, OPEC
said in the report.  Exports of crude and petroleum products from all OPEC
nations increased 7 percent in 2012 to 29.6 million barrels a
day, equivalent to 46 percent of world exports, the report
showed.  OPEC’s members are  Algeria ,  Angola ,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq,
 Kuwait , Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
