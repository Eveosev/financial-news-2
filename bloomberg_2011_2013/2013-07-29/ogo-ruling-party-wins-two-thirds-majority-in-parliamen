Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe’s ruling Union for the Republic won more than two-thirds of the seats in Parliament in last week’s vote.  Preliminary results show the party won 62 of the 91 seats
in the July 24 election, Angele Aguigah, president of the
National Independent Electoral Commission, told reporters in the
capital, Lome, yesterday.  The main opposition Save Togo coalition won 19 seats and
the Rainbow coalition got six positions, Aguigah said. The Union
of Forces for Change, led by Gilchrist Olympio, obtained three
seats after previously occupying 27 positions, she said.  Gnassingbe, 47, in 2005 succeeded his father, who had ruled
the West African nation of 6.1 million people since 1967. He was
reelected in 2010 amid claims by the opposition of
irregularities. The $3.7 billion economy, which earns foreign
currency from exports of cotton, coffee and cocoa, is forecast
to expand 5.1 percent this year from 5 percent in 2012,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
