U.K. government bonds advanced for a
third day as U.K. mortgage approvals unexpectedly fell in June
and business lending dropped, boosting demand for safer assets.  The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity German bunds shrank to the narrowest
in a month. The pound weakened for a second day against the
dollar before the Bank of  England  meets this week to review
policy and publishes its quarterly Inflation Report on Aug. 7.
Economists predict the central bank will keep its bond-buying
target at 375 billion pounds and its base rate at a record-low
0.5 percent when its announces the decisions on Aug. 1.  “Gilts are performing quite well, outperforming bunds,
which has been a theme recently,” said Jamie Searle, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London. “We think
Thursday will just be an announcement that policy rates and
quantitative easing are on hold and we probably won’t be getting
too much else, which very much puts all the focus on the
Inflation Report.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.32 percent at the 5 p.m. close of trading
in  London  after falling to 2.24 percent on July 19, the lowest
level since June 20. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September
2022 rose 0.12, or 1.20 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,534) face
amount, to 95.36.  The extra yield on the securities over similar-dated bunds
shrank one basis point to 65 basis points after contracting to
64 basis points, the least since June 24. The difference was as
much as 82 basis points on July 5.  Forward Guidance  At Governor Mark Carney’s first Bank of England meeting on
July 3-4, policy makers signaled they would keep interest rates
at a record low for longer than investors had been betting. The
analysis of providing forward guidance to be published next
month will include an assessment of intermediate thresholds.  “Since Carney has taken over the Bank of England and the
early signs are he’s going to signal some kind of additional
stimulus, probably in the form of forward guidance, that’s
allowing gilts to regain some of their lost ground versus
bunds,” Citigroup’s Searle said.  U.K. lenders granted 57,667 home loans last month compared
with a revised 58,071 in May, the Bank of England said in
London. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast an
increase to 59,700. Business lending fell by 1.3 billion pounds.  Ernst & Young’s Item Club said corporate lending will fall
for a fifth year in 2013 to 422 billion pounds. This year will
be the “trough,” with lending seen rising 7 percent in 2014,
it said today in a report in London.  Gilts returned 0.7 percent in the past month through July
26, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bunds also
rose 0.7 percent and U.S. Treasuries returned 0.3 percent.  The pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.5350 after rising to
$1.5435 on July 25, the strongest level since June 26. Sterling
was little changed at 86.33 pence per euro.  Sterling has weakened 1 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track
10 developed-nation currencies. The dollar fell 2 percent and
the euro strengthened 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
