Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  is one
of the few producers of the metal set to benefit from government
plans to reduce overcapacity, investor  Mark Mobius  said today.  “Chalco will be the one left standing,” Mobius, who
manages $53 billion as the executive chairman of Templeton
Emerging Markets Group, said in an interview in Bangkok today.
‘The government doesn’t want to see this excess capacity in the
country.’’  China ordered more than 1,400 companies in 19 industries
including aluminum to ease oversupply, according to a July 25
statement from the Ministry of Industry and  Information
Technology . Smaller aluminum companies in China will “fall by
the wayside” as power becomes too expensive and as the
government begins to “winnow out” producers, Mobius said.  While China’s biggest aluminum producer will be able to
raise the capital it needs, Chalco’s smaller competitors will
find it more difficult, Mobius said.  Chalco  shares  dropped 2.7 percent today in  Hong Kong , the
most in three weeks and extending this year’s retreat to 28
percent. Units of  Franklin Resources Inc. (BEN) , Templeton’s parent
company, have a combined stake of about 31 percent in Chalco,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company is a “good long-term bet” even though the
“price performance has been terrible,” Mobius said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
