The  New York Jets  agreed to a
contract with their top draft pick Dee Milliner, the final
member of the team’s draft class who had yet to sign.  Milliner, a cornerback selected with the ninth pick of the
National Football League draft in April, will join the Jets
today on their fourth day of full-squad training camp at the
State University of New York College at Cortland, the team said
on its website.  Contract terms weren’t disclosed. The former  University of
Alabama  player signed a fully guaranteed four-year, $12.7
million contract, according to ESPN.  Milliner had six interceptions and 136 tackles in three
years at Alabama. He’s also had five surgeries, including one on
his shoulder in March, and his ability to participate in
training camp has yet to be decided, according to ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
