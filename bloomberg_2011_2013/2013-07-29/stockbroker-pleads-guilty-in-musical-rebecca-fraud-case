Mark Hotton, a former Oppenheimer &
Co. broker, pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud and
admitted he took part in a scheme to defraud the producers of
the Broadway musical “Rebecca.”  Hotton, 47, of West Islip, New York, was accused by the
office of  Manhattan  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of concocting
bogus investors to bilk the show’s producers out of at least
$500,000. Prosecutors said Hotton misled the producers into
believing he had secured $4.5 million from overseas investors to
meet a budget shortfall.  After the producers pressed him and his purported investors
to send the money they had pledged, Hotton orchestrated a story
of the false illness, hospitalization and untimely death of one
investor, prosecutors said. When it became clear that funding
from the bogus backers would fall through, Hotton tried to set
up a $1 million loan and lure the producers into paying him a
$35,000 fee for brokering it, according to prosecutors.  “Some of the fees and expenses I received to raise money
for the musical ‘Rebecca’ were paid as a result of false
pretenses by me,” Hotton told Judge  John Koeltl  in Manhattan
today.  The judge, who set sentencing for Nov. 1, said that under a
plea agreement, Hotton agreed to forfeit $500,000 and could get
33 months to 41 months in prison.  The case is U.S. v. Hotton, 12-cr-00825, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
