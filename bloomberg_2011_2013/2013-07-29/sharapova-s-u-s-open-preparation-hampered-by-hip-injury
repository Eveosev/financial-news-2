Maria Sharapova ’s preparation for
next month’s  U.S. Open  is being hampered by a hip injury that
caused the Russian to withdraw from the Rogers Cup tournament in
Toronto, starting Aug. 3.  Sharapova, the 2006 U.S. Open champion, hasn’t played
competitively since she was ousted from the second round of
Wimbledon on June 26 by Portuguese qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito. During that match, Sharapova frequently slipped on the
grass and had treatment on her hip after she fell on the
baseline.  “I’m extremely disappointed that I am unable to play in
Toronto next week as it’s one of the best and most important
tournaments of the year,” Sharapova said on her website last
night. “I was looking forward to making a healthy return to the
courts in front of my Canadian fans but unfortunately I’m just
not recovered yet.”  Sharapova also withdrew from a hard-court event in
Stanford, California. That tournament was won yesterday by
Slovakia’s  Dominika Cibulkova , who beat top-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.  The U.S. Open, the season’s last Grand Slam tournament,
starts Aug. 26 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
