Crude options volatility rose as
futures traded in a $2 range for a third day, awaiting the
outcome of a Federal Reserve policy meeting that ends July 31.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options value, was 21.4 percent on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange at 2:05 p.m., from 21.03 percent July 26.  “We’ve got into a new range,” said  Phil Flynn , senior
market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The market
can’t make a decision on what its next move is going to be until
it knows what the Fed is going to do.”  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery
slipped 19 cents to $104.51 a barrel on the Nymex, and traded
today between $103.87 and $105.87.  The Fed is expected to announce at the end of its two-day
meeting whether it intends to reduce the scale of its $85
billion in bond purchases or leave the program unchanged.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $93 puts, which fell 4 cents to 5 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,657 lots traded as of 2:12 p.m. September $110 calls
were the second-most active, dropping 8 cents to 26 cents on
volume of 2,073 contracts.  Puts accounted for 63 percent of electronic trading volume.
In the prior session, bearish bets made up 53 percent of 76,921
contracts exchanged.  September $100 puts were the most-active options July 26
with 4,619 contracts changing hands as they increased 3 cents to
63 cents a barrel. September $95 puts declined 1 cent to 15
cents on 3,933 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
38,626 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 37,786 lots
and December $70 puts with 35,002.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
