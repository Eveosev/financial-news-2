West Texas Intermediate crude
rebounded from near its lowest level in almost three weeks amid
speculation that conflict in the  Middle East  may spread and
threaten supplies.  Futures gained 0.6 percent after losing 3.1 percent last
week. Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood today defied the army-backed
government’s threats to crack down on protests, urging loyalists
demanding the reinstatement of ousted President Mohamed Mursi to
march on security installations. Iraq stopped pumping crude to
the Turkish port of Ceyhan, according to Boutros Maritime &
Transports, a port agent.  Saudi Arabia ’s billionaire  Prince
Alwaleed bin Talal  cautioned against increasing production
capacity because he sees demand waning.  “There is enough uncertainty about supplies and strength
in demand, currently and through the next month,” to support
crude prices said Amrita Sen, chief oil market analyst
at Energy Aspects Ltd., a consulting company in  London .  WTI for September delivery advanced as much as 67 cents to
$105.37 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange barrel, and was at $105.11 at 1:48 p.m.
London time, after declining as much as 83 cents to $103.87, the
lowest since July 9. The volume of all futures traded was 3
percent lower than the 100-day average.  Brent for September settlement gained as much as 72 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $107.89 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark was at a premium
of $2.50 to WTI futures, up from $2.47 on July 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
