Directors of  Maidenform Brands Inc. (MFB) ,
the intimate-apparel company being bought by underwear maker
 HanesBrands Inc. (HBI)  for $575 million, were sued by an investor
seeking more money in the deal.  Maidenform, based in Iselin, New Jersey, said July 24 it
would be bought by HanesBrands, based in Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, for $23.50 a share, a 23 percent premium at the time.  “The merger consideration agreed to by the board is
grossly unfair” and “does not reflect the intrinsic value of
the company as a takeover candidate,” investment custodian
Bonnie Federman contended in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint
made public today.  Maidenform directors have a duty to get the best possible
price for the stock, and a judge should stop the buyout under
its present terms, Federman said in court papers.  “Maidenform does not comment on pending litigation,”
Jonathan Doorley, a spokesman for the company with Sard
Verbinnen & Co., said in an e-mailed statement.  The case is Federman v. Maidenform, CA8750,  Delaware 
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
