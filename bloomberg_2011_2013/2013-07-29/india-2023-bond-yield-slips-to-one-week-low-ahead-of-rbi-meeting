India ’s 10-year bond yield slipped
to a one-week low ahead of a central bank meeting to set
 interest rates  tomorrow.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will maintain its key  repurchase
rate  at 7.25 percent after lowering it three times this year,
according to 31 of 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. One
expects a cut of 25 basis points. The monetary authority this
month raised two interest rates and drained liquidity to steady
the rupee, which slumped to a record low of 61.2125 a dollar on
July 8. A weaker currency makes imports costlier and threatens
to spur gains in  consumer prices , which have climbed at an
annual rate of about 10 percent for more than a year.  “Volumes in the market are pretty low” ahead of the
central bank meeting, said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income
trader at  Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB)  in Mumbai. “The
currency’s stability remains the key concern.”  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 fell four
basis points to 8.12 percent as of 10:55 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to prices from the central bank’s trading system. The
rate was at 8.42 percent on July 24, the highest for a 10-year
benchmark bond since May 2012. The rupee fell 0.2 percent to
59.1875 per dollar, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg.  The RBI this month capped the amount banks can borrow in
daily repurchase auctions at 0.5 percent of deposits, and
increased the daily balance requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratios to 99 percent from 70 percent effective July 27.
It raised the marginal standing facility and the  bank rate  to
10.25 percent from 8.25 percent on July 15.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, slid seven basis
points to 9.25 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate was at a five-year high of 9.50 percent on July 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
