Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) , the
largest U.S. mall owner, reported an increase in second-quarter
funds from operations and raised its FFO forecast for the year
as it redevelops centers domestically and expands overseas.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $766.3 million, or $2.11 a share, from $688.8
million, or $1.89, a year earlier, the Indianapolis-based real
estate investment trust said today in a statement. The  average 
of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $2.07 a share.  The company is renovating its existing malls and building
new outlet shopping centers to boost growth. Simon is the
biggest U.S. owner of both regional malls and outlet centers,
where retailers sell at a discount. It’s also investing
internationally and last month agreed to buy a buy a stake in
closely held McArthurGlen Group,  Europe ’s biggest outlet-center
operator, for 435 million euros ($578 million).  “They’re continuing to find attractive investments,”
Craig Guttenplan, a REIT analyst at CreditSights Inc. in  London ,
said before the results were released. “It just speaks to
Simon’s ability to partner with the biggest and best operators
globally.”  Revenue increased 4.1 percent from a year earlier to $1.24
billion. Occupancies at Simon’s U.S. properties climbed to 95.1
percent from 94.2 percent. The base minimum rent in the second
quarter was $41.41 a square foot, up from $39.99.  The company raised its estimate of FFO for the year to
$8.60 to $8.70 a share, up from an April forecast of $8.50 to
$8.60 a share. The average of 22 analyst estimates is $8.69.  Second-quarter results were announced before U.S. markets
opened. Simon rose 0.5 percent to $164.54 on July 26. The shares
have gained 3.5 percent in past 12 months, compared with a 9.7
percent advance for the Bloomberg REIT Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
